		THE DIAL A
FORTNIGHTLY Release Political Prisoners	ORGANIZATION	.

		HERE ARE NOW in prison in this country several hundred persons convicted according to law on various charges , most of which may be summarized as obstructing the
United States	LOCATION	in the conduct of the war .

		Whether their status is technically to be defined as that of political prisoners is a legal ques - tion upon which the
Department of Justice	ORGANIZATION	is under - stood to be engaged .

		In fact they are such .

		All are victims of an interpretation of the ` necessary means of securing the welfare and success of the nation in war .

		Some of them , indeed , are suffering as the result of a devotion to an interpretation of such means differing from that of the majority , but pre - sumably no less high-minded and unselfish .

		The war is over .

		The nation should follow the historic example offered even by autocracies in the past , and set free those prisoners for whose detention a national crisis no longer offers excuse .

		It should act fully , generously , immediately .

		These political prisoners fall into various classes according to legal definition , but in the popular mind they form two groups the victims of the
Selective Service	ORGANIZATION	Law and of the Espionage Act the first being known as conscientious objectors .

		There is no question connected with the subject of democracy at war more perplexing than theirs .

		The attitude of the Secretary of War was from the first reasonable and sympathetic , and on his initiative there have been conspicuous instances of wise dealing with this problem .

		But against these must be set the terrible stories of torture and ignominy which emanate from
Camp Funston	LOCATION	and
Fort Leavenworth	LOCATION	.

		Reports are received of atrocities that defy description , and the tardy action of the War Office in forbidding certain brutal practices and in dismissing and even holding for trial certain officers charged with special cruel - ties , shows that these reports are not without founda - tion .

		The Secretary of War is not able to control his subordinates ; the authority of the President , as Commander-in-Chief , has been defied .

		And it will always be defied when conscientious objectors are placed at the mercy of military authorities .

		The
United States	LOCATION	army has boasted of its record in banishing the effects of one form of vice from its camps : it has deliberately introduced the temptation to another and one -LRB- by virtue of its example -RRB- not less dangerous .

		In the account of the treatment of conscientious objectors at
Camp Funston	LOCATION	it is re - corded : `` Most of the mistreatment took place out - side , with large groups watching this sorry and revolting spectacle . ''

		Surely nothing could have been worse for the morale of a democratic army , an army which came from the people and must return to it , or for the morale of a people among whom the custom of lynching assumes almost the character of a national vice .

		For the sake of our future citizen - ship as affected by the return of the soldiers to our population the temptation to lawless violence should be removed from our military camps and prisons , and the example of it repudiated .

		The Secretary of War will probably not be able to secure the punish - ment of the officers and men responsible for the treatment of conscientious objectors .

		The most effect - ive way of marking the disapproval which all true Americans cognizant with the facts must feel at their savagery is in the release of the men whom they have abused .

		The problem of the individual and the state , raised by the demand for military service , will not be solved in a military camp or prison .

		Indeed its solution has ceased to be of instant im - portance .

		If the
United States	LOCATION	has truly won the war , this problem need never be solved .

		At all events we protest against further attempt to solve it through the sufferings of the present group of conscientious objectors .

		They have given of their bodies and souls in this terrible dilemma .

		Granted that they caused an appreciable loss to the energy of this country as mobilized for war , they are many of them ready and able to render the highest and most devoted service in peace .

		Their withdrawal from the life of the community will remain a mark of the weakness of our
Government	ORGANIZATION	, not of its strength .

		As an initial measure of reconstruction we'ask for the release of the conscientious objectors .

		The cases of persons convicted under the
Espion	PERSON	- age Act are various , ranging from that of the college boy who was provoked into saying that `` he would THE DIAL
January 1 1	DATE	like to stick a knife into
Wilson	PERSON	, '' to that of
Eugene Debs	PERSON	and other Socialists who have seriously chal - lenged the interpretation placed on the war by American patriotic idealism .

		These cases for the most part arise out of limitations placed on freedom of speech .

		Whether such limitations were desirable or necessary is not now the question .

		In any case they have done their work .

		No further gain can be anticipated by keeping their violators in prison or , in case they are still free on pending appeals , by sending them there .

		All of these persons were convicted in circum - stances of popular excitement when the public mind was concerned with the question of national de - fense , and when , further , it may be noted , the in - dividuals and interests which depend directly upon public opinion the press , the politicians , the officials were subject to the temptation to use this popular excitement for their own purposes to profiteer in patriotism .

		The question whether those convicted had , or could have , a fair trial may therefore be raised .

		It has been charged that representatives of the
Department of Justice	ORGANIZATION	and the Post Office De - partment interfered with measures taken in defense of the accused , notably in the case of the I. W. W. leaders convicted in
Chicago	LOCATION
last September	DATE	, pre - venting the raising of defense funds , and intimidat - ing witnesses .

		The whole effort of the machinery of justice and of public opinion has been to secure con - viction and too often the heavy sentence has re - vealed the judicial practice of registering patriotism in terms of the penal servitude of others .

		In view of the inequalities attending the administration of justice in these cases we demand the release of the prisoners .

		There is another reason for the pardon of these political prisoners one of which every American is aware and yet of which he must speak with reserve .

		Granted that these men have made difficult the conduct of the war , that they have embarrassed the
Government	ORGANIZATION	by diminishing confidence in its plat - form , they do not stand alone in their offense .

		It may well be questioned whether all offenders against the Espionage Act have done as much to shake the foundations of democracy as the advocates and prac - ticers of mob law who have pursued them .

		Granted that the I.W.W. leaders have been guilty of offenses as charged , it remains to be considered whether the net result of their damage to our insti - tutions approximates that of the mobs at
Bisbee	LOCATION	and at
Tulsa	LOCATION	.

		If the
Government	ORGANIZATION	found it necessary to punish with extreme severity in one case , it should have found means to do so in the other .

		Contrast the overzealous pursuit of the I.W.W. leaders by the
Department of Justice	ORGANIZATION	with its tardy and languid proceedings against
Sheriff Wheeler	PERSON	and the
Bisbee	LOCATION	deporters .

		The plea that no federal law exists to insure a citizen the peaceful possession of his life and property must seem to the victim of deportation an evasion when he sees the Espionage Act created to meet an emergency of another kind .

		As in the case of the conscientious objectors , the attitude of the
Administration	ORGANIZATION	has been a futile gesture .

		President
Wilson	PERSON	has called the violators of public order traitors to the cause for which we went to war .

		Undoubtedly in the crisis the belligerent zeal which found vent in verbal violence on the part of those compelled by age or ecclesiastical position to abstain from actual fighting constituted a re - serve of the will to war too valuable to be dissi - pated .

		Undoubtedly the initiative , strategy , and ex - perience involved in the conduct of mob war made younger and more secular leaders like
Sheriff Wheeler	PERSON	of
Bisbee	LOCATION	ideal army officers , with whose services it would have been foolish to ask the Gov - ernment to dispense .

		But the period of war , in which such inconsistencies and incongruities were difficult to avoid , has passed .

		In the period of reconstruction the affirmation , of the equality of men before the law requires amnesty On the one hand to balance immunity on the other .

		The
United States	LOCATION	is entering the
Congress of Nations	ORGANIZATION	with a program of justice and freedom for all nationalities and of a better world for all man - kind .

		Already it is clear that its strength in these councils is due to the support of democratic masses the world over .

		What better foundation for its work can be established than by act of amnesty to release those whose imprisonment is a scandal and rock of offense to democracy everywhere ?

		Not a few of them fell beneath the law as the result of their efforts to plead the cause of self-determination in behalf of this or that nation whose claims will be considered by the world court of
Ireland	LOCATION	or of
Russia	LOCATION	.

		What more striking evidence of belief in its own cause could our country give than to set them free ?

		We look forward to a new world dominated by a league of free nations from which not even our late enemies shall be excluded .

		As the President has said , such a creation must depend fundamentally upon an act of faith in humanity .

		What greater token of faith can we give than by granting pardon even to those who have been against us in the struggle of nationalities , now happily con - cluded ?

		We demand as a matter of essential justice to our citizens , of faith in our historic democracy , and of loyalty to our own cause of a better world that our political prisoners be set free .

		8 THE DIAL
January 11	DATE	Repeal the Espionage Law AN ADDRESS DELIVERED BEFORE THE Civic CLUB OF
NEW YORK	LOCATION	,
DECEMBER 3 , 1918	DATE	IHE PRESIDENT told us yesterday that the moment the armistice was signed he took the harness off from business , but he did not say anything about taking the halter off from free speech .

		Industry , he tells us , is unshackled ; but the embargo on ideas remains , and we may as well acknowledge that it will remain unless the people themselves take what - ever steps are necessary to remove it .

		I venture the opinion that for more than a year past there has not been a member of this club who has dared to say what he or she thought about the most vital policies of the Government of this country in those partic - ulars most intimately affecting the lives of all the people .

		The President spoke eloquently yesterday concerning the wrongs of the unfortunate people of
Belgium	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	, but I did not observe that he said anything about the wrongs of our own people .

		When the President arrives in
Europe	LOCATION	let us hope that he will learn that political prisoners have been freed over there , and this may perhaps remind him of hundreds of his fellow countrymen who are de - prived of their liberty here for political offenses .

		He may perhaps even learn that , of all the warring countries , this is the only one that treats political offenders like common criminals except that it treats them more harshly .

		But you have asked me to speak on the Espionage Law .

		I have the law here .

		Both the Act of
June 15 , 1917	DATE	, and the Amendment of
May 16 , 1918	DATE	.

		But its enumeration of the things you can not say , or do , or write is so long that if I took time to read the whole law I should not have time to say any - thing else .

		So I am just going to read Section 3 of Title I , the section under which most , although not all , the prosecutions have been conducted and the section which , in conjunction with
Title XII	ORGANIZATION	, is relied upon to give the
Post Office Department	ORGANIZATION	the right to censor your mail and suppress radical pub - lications .

		Section 3 of Title I is as follows : Whoever , when the
United States	LOCATION	is at war , shall wil - fully make or convey false reports or false statements with intent to interfere with the operation or success of the military or naval forces of the
United States	LOCATION	or to promote the success of its enemies and whoever , when the
United States	LOCATION	is at war , shall wilfully cause or attempt to cause insubordination , disloyalty , mutiny , or refusal of duty , in the military or naval forces of the
United States	LOCATION	, or shall wilfully obstruct the recruiting or enlistment service of the
United States	LOCATION	, shall be punished by a fine of not more than
$ 10,000	MONEY	or imprisonment for not more - twenty years , or both .

		Now that is rather a harmless sounding law .

		But the way it works is this : some pacifist says he does not believe in war ; that all war is murder .

		Im - mediately a
Federal District Attorney	ORGANIZATION	is directed to take the case of this malefactor before a grand jury and have him indicted .

		The indictment is returned almost as a matter of course upon the demand of the law officer of the
Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		Then this enemy of the people is hailed before the trial jury , and right here is where you become aware of how smoothly the system works .

		The mind of the jury has been carefully prepared for months in advance , by a con - trolled press , to find the defendant guilty .

		The mails have been closed to radical and independent publications which might suggest that one had the right to opinions even in war time .

		The vigilante committees have terrorized the community from which the jury is drawn .

		The officers of the In - telligence
Service	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- so-called -RRB- of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	and
Navy	ORGANIZATION	have raided the homes of citizens , seizing their papers and their effects , and even their persons , with - out a warrant and without the least legal authority , and have thereby demonstrated that they are above the law .

		The patriotic organizations and the
Creel Bureau	ORGANIZATION	have flooded the country , at the expense of the people , with fantastic tales calculated to excite the passions and inflame the imagination of the ordi - nary citizen , until impartial judgment has become impossible on questions relating to the war .

		Finally , and not the least important , a Federal Judge , who holds his job by appointment of the President , often charges the jury on the law , and sometimes on the facts as well , in such way that conviction is prac - tically certain .

		When the humble and unsophisti - cated citizen , whose only offense was that he hated war and abhorred its bloodshed and its cruelties , comes out of the hurly-burly of the trial and has time to catch his breath , he finds himself duly branded as a criminal and sentenced to a punishment more severe than is often inflicted for robbery , rape , or murder .

		Again , some Socialist , dreaming of the brother - hood of man , the federation of the world , when the war-drums shall throb no longer , ventures to say that he sees no good in the workers ' of one country killing those of another .

		Forthwith he is appre - hended as a German propagandist , as an agent of the
Kaiser	PERSON	, and a tool of autocracy .

		And he gets very short shrift in the courts , if for no other reason THE DIAL than that he is a Socialist .

		I will take time here to call your attention to the case of just one Socialist , of which I speak from personal knowledge .

		Last
summer	DATE	I defended a young man before a Court Martial at .

		Camp Dix who was charged with violat - ing the Ninety-Sixth Article of War .

		The charge was as follows : Charge 1 : Violation of the 96th Article of War .

		Specification 1 : In that
Americo V. Alexander	PERSON	-LRB- No .

		1773144 -RRB- Private , Medical Detachment ,
Base Hospital	ORGANIZATION	,
Camp Dix	LOCATION	,
N. J.	PERSON	, did , at
New York City	LOCATION	, N. Y. , on or about the
28th day of May , 1918	DATE	, with intent to interfere with the successful operation of the military forces of the
United States	LOCATION	, make the following statements in the pres - ence and hearing of various persons : `` You can get out of active service when drafted by refusing to do any military duty on ground of conscientious scruples .

		Your failure to register as such on Questionnaire would not prevent your now asserting your rights .

		You might be put in the guard house and even court-martialed and sen - tenced to twenty years , but you would never be forced to serve .

		You might expect pretty rough treatment but if you were a true objector and stuck they would do nothing to you .

		One objector at
Camp Dix	LOCATION	had been beaten , gagged , kicked and gassed , while in the guard house , but having stuck , he was alright now ; this matter was being kept very secret .

		He got a job in the
Base Hospital	ORGANIZATION	and the
Army	ORGANIZATION	was very glad to get him to do anything , as the other objectors did not work and were only an ex - pense , '' or words to that effect .

		Specification 2 : In that
Americo V. Alexander	PERSON	-LRB- No .

		1773144 -RRB- Private , Medical Detachment ,
Base Hospital	ORGANIZATION	,
Camp Dix	LOCATION	,
N. J.	PERSON	, while holding himself out to be a con - scientious objector , was at
New York City	LOCATION	, N. Y. , on or about the twenty-eighth day of
May , 1918	DATE	, active in pro- paganda to the prejudice of the successful operations of the military forces of the
United States	LOCATION	in that he advised , counseled and attempted to persuade various persons to state that they were conscientious objectors when the said persons would be inducted into the military service of the
United States	LOCATION	under the provisions of the Selective Service Act .

		This , you see , in military language , charged a violation of the Espionage Law .

		We took about a week to try the case and substantially the entire contest centered about the truth or falsity of those charges .

		There were some minor charges involving the young man 's temporary refusal to work while seeking advice from superior officers immediately following his arrest , thinking that it might interfere with his rights as a conscientious objector .

		But when reassured upon this point , he promptly abandoned that position and thereafter was a model prisoner .

		I will say also that he accepted non-combatant ser - vice upon his induction into the service as a con - scientious objector .

		He had managed the
Supply Department of the Base Hospital	ORGANIZATION	at
Camp Dix	LOCATION	so effectively as to be complimented by officials at
Washington	LOCATION	and had been suggested for a commis - sion by his commanding officer , which he had refused because he was a conscientious objector .

		Now the singular and , so far as I know , unprecedented thing about this trial was that the Court Martial found the young man `` not guilty '' of the charge I have just read to you , and the record which I hold in my hand so shows .

		But when the record came to me after it had gone to
Washington	LOCATION	and passed through the hands of a reviewing officer , it showed that the find - ing of the Court Martial in this respect had been reversed .

		As the members of
the Court Martial	ORGANIZATION	, which consisted of eight officers , heard all the testi - mony and were the only officers who ever did hear the testimony or any portion of it , I was curious to know who it was that had decided that he could render a better decision on the facts without hearing the testimony than the members of
the Court Martial	ORGANIZATION	could who did hear it .

		And so I went to
Washington	LOCATION	, and af te - a day 's inquiry from Depart - ment to Department I was able to locate the record in one of the innumerable offices of the War Depart - ment and was allowed even to look at it , although told that it was a private record and that I could not take a cppy of it .

		I did however examine it sufficiently under the eye of the officer , who kept both the record and myself in sight , to find out that the person who discovered that the
Court Martial	ORGANIZATION	had been all wrong in its findings was a first lieu - tenant named
William J. Martin	PERSON	.

		I have not the remotest idea who Mr.
Martin	PERSON	is in private life , but he seems to have signed himself `` Judge Advo - cate '' at
Camp Dix	LOCATION	, although Iknow he had abso - lutely nothing to do with the trial of the case , for I know well Captain Lilly of the
New York	LOCATION	bar , the Judge Advocate who did try it , and who tried it most ably for the prosecution .

		But this Lieutenant
Martin	PERSON	wrote the opinion endorsed by the General who , like himself , had never heard any of the testi - mony which reversed the findings of `` not guilty '' by the Court Martial ; and the point of my calling your attention to this is the reason assigned for the reversal .

		I quote two sentences which I was able to copy from the opinion ` of
Lieutenant Martin	ORGANIZATION	.

		They are as follows : In view of the fact that this man is a Socialist and as such opposed to all law and order , I can not see how he could have been classed as a conscientious objector ... The testimony shows that he is not opposed to war as a conscientious objector but is opposed for the same reason that th
% Russian Government	ORGANIZATION	is opposed to it and belongs to an organization that is opposed to all forms of order and systems of
Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		The word `` organization '' has a line lightly drawn through it , done apparently after the opinion had been filed , and the words `` radical element '' written above .

		Read either way , the statement is wholly IO THE DIAL
January 11	DATE	, false .

		And the finding of `` not guilty '' of the Court Martial on the charge I have read was reversed , and Mr.
Alexander	PERSON	, whose crime appears to have been that he is a Socialist , is undergoing twenty years ' imprisonment .

		I wonder how many other men and women are undergoing punishment fn this country
today	DATE	because they are Socialists .

		Why , if this had occurred in
Belgium	LOCATION	during the German occupation and had been perpetrated by a
German Court Martial	ORGANIZATION	, we should dramatize it , and put it in the movies as an illustration of German atrocities .

		If
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	of the
United States	LOCATION	, composed of nine great judges , presumed to reverse the find - ing of a jury in a criminal case on conflicting testi - mony , it would be a ground for impeaching the mem - bers of ` that court .

		But suppose the worst of all assume that some citizen , misguided if you please , had a doubt about this war 's being altogether a war for democracy , or even had a suspicion that trade rivalries and ambi - tions between European nations were at the bottom of the war and that perhaps it might have been just as well if we had kept out of it , and * having such doubt or suspicion , had expressed it in a speech or in a publication you know what would have hap - pened to such a person without my reciting it .

		Such a one were lucky if he only went to prison for ten or twenty years .

		Just to contrast the condition into which we have allowed ourselves to sink with con - ditions where at least some freedom of speech exists , I am going to read you a few sentences from Pro- fessor
Shapiro	PERSON	's Modern and
Contemporary Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean History -LSB-
Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 3.50	MONEY	-RSB- .

		It has been off the press only a few _ weeks .

		Professor
Shapiro	PERSON	is known to many of you .

		He is an Asso - ciate Professor of History in the
College of the City	LOCATION	of
New York	LOCATION	and one of the foremost historians of the world .

		At page 338 he says : The Boer War was fought during the
Salisbury Min	ORGANIZATION	- istry .

		The war was opposed by the Liberals but was en - thusiastically supported by the overwhelming majority of the English people , and in the general election of
1900	DATE	, the Conservatives were returned to power on the war issue with a majority of 134 .

		It is fair to say that the Boer War , in the opinion of many Englishmen , involved the fate of the Em - pire , for if
Great Britain	LOCATION	had shown herself unable to crush the
Boers	LOCATION	, it would have been a signal for every colony she had in the world to throw off her rule .

		But of the opposition to the war by the Liberals , of which
Lloyd George	PERSON	was the leader , the author reports : They denounced it as an act of aggression against the inoffensive
Boers	ORGANIZATION	in the interest of South African capi - talists .

		Think of that , a capitalistic war .

		I quote again : Large mass meetings of pro-Boers were held all over
England	LOCATION	, at which the
Conservative Ministry	ORGANIZATION	was severely criticised for being the tool of interested financiers .

		And nobody was prosecuted for sedition .

		But the author also tells us the result of this freedom of dis - cussion ; for he says , referring to a period of
two or three years later	DATE	: There was great disgust in
England	LOCATION	with the
Conserva	LOCATION	- tive
Party	ORGANIZATION	because of its conduct of the Boer War , and in the election of
1906	DATE	, the Liberals were overwhelmingly successful .

		If I should read you even a portion of what
Lloyd George	PERSON	said about his
Government	ORGANIZATION	during that war , I suppose I might be arrested in this country
today	DATE	for slandering
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		Here is the point I wish to make very clear .

		The Espionage Law can just as well be applied in peace as in war , and just as good reasons can be given for its application in peace as in war .

		Practically , we are not at war now ; but who of the
Administration	ORGANIZATION	suggests the repeal of the Espionage Law ?

		Who , when exercising arbitrary power , ever proposes to repeal the law which silences criticism of the man - ner in which such power is exercised ?

		I am not concerned about the right of the soap-box orator to make a speech because he feels good while he is doing it , and feels better after he has done it , although I think that is rather wholesome ; but if a people are capable of self-government , they must be capable of contributing some ideas of value to the government if they are allowed free expression .

		If a people have self-government , they must have freedom of expres - sion respecting it , or theirs will become the worst government in the world .

		Far better take away the vote than take away free speech and a free press ; and far better take away free speech and a free press than allow freedom to discuss only one side of a subject .

		President
Wilson	PERSON	is going abroad today dis - credited that is , without the support of the Con - gress in my opinion , because of the Espionage Law .

		Whatever could have been said for his fourteen points in behalf of their making for peace and progress remained unsaid because of the ruthless suppression by means of the Espionage Law of all discussion of the causes of the war , and of our ob - jects and aims in the war .

		The Republicans , taking advantage of the suppression of all discussion which could be classed as anti-war , cleverly whipped to frenzy the war sentiment , and by announcing more drastic war aims than the President himself they at - tracted the support of the war extremists throughout
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 1 1 the country , while the hundreds of thousands of citizens whose votes had elected President
Wilson	PERSON	because `` he kept us out of war '' no longer trusted him for any purpose , and voted the Socialist or some other ticket , or did not vote at all .

		If it is a mis - fortune that the President stands today repudiated by the voters of the country at the recent election , it is a misfortune that has been brought about by the suppression of all discussion of the war , except that which was intended to excite and inflame the people to go to any length in its prosecution .

		But , someone says , civil liberties were invaded during the time of our great Civil War and were later recovered .

		The comparison is entirely falla - cious .

		Civil liberty , so far as it was denied during the Civil War , was not denied because of any Es - pionage Law .

		The
Post Office Department	ORGANIZATION	never claimed or exercised the power to suppress publica - tions during the Civil War .

		Indeed the men in control of the country during that war had taken the position that the exercise of any such power by the
Post Office Department	ORGANIZATION	would * be unconstitu - tional .

		The slave-holding states had sought to inr voke such power to protect themselves against a flood of anti-slave literature , and it had been ably argued and held by the leaders of the North that any such law would be unconstitutional .

		Every arrest made without warrant during the Civil War was an arrest by the military authorities .

		Every paper that was suppressed was suppressed by the military authori - ties , and in most cases President Lincoln immedi - ately ordered the restoration of mailing privileges to such a paper .

		Every suppression of civil liberty during that war came from the military arm of the
Government	ORGANIZATION	and it had to disappear as soon as the army was disbanded .

		The great
Milligan Case	PERSON	, following upon the heels of the war , in which
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	decided that the military arrests had been unlawful , promptly restored the people once more to the full enjoyment of the liberties which the Constitution had been held to guarantee .

		But now all this is changed : The Espionage Law is not going to be repealed unless the people resolutely take the matter in hand ; instead it will be skilfully extended to suppress discussion which may be said to be an incitement to war , or to disturbance , or to violence .

		The
Post Office Department	ORGANIZATION	will , unless the people are aroused , continue to exercise a censorship more arbitrary and irresponsible than ever existed , either in war or in peace , in any country which made a pre - tense of being free .

		There is just one thing , in my opinion , for the citizens to do who believe in liberty and desire to preserve at least some measure of freedom : that is to organize .

		for the repeal of this obnoxious law , and never to disband their organization or cease their agitation until the law has been discredited and re - pealed , and until every person convicted under it and not shown to be guilty of some act in aid of the enemy has been pardoned , and every fine collected under it repaid by the
Government	ORGANIZATION	.


GILBERT E. ROE	PERSON	.

		A
Rational Explanation of Vers Libre IHE	ORGANIZATION	WORLD is in need of a reasonable explanation of the perplexing phenomenon known as vers libre .

		Since the Imagists came upon the scene about
five years ago	DATE	, with their talk about cadence and their disposition to experiment freely in all sorts of forms , a great deal has been written for and against vers libre , and a great many writers good , bad , and in - different in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, have shown a disposition to revolt from the old forms of metrical verse .

		But no one has yet attempted to explain clearly and simply , for the benefit of the man in the street , just what `` free verse '' is .

		The latest theory that holds the field in
America	LOCATION	merely leaves the confusion worse confounded .

		This is the theory of Professor
William Morrison Patter	PERSON	- son , which has now the backing of no less a person than
Miss Amy Lowell	ORGANIZATION	.

		Miss
Lowell	PERSON	's earlier theory of the strophe 's being in itself a complete circle , part of which could be taken rapidly and part slowly at will was difficult enough for the uninitiated to grasp ; but this new theory of Doctor
Patterson	PERSON	's is worse .

		We are told that verse contains no less than six species : metrical verse , unitary verse , spaced prose , polyphonic prose , mosaics , and blends .

		In the future the public will apparently have to recite every poem they like into a phonograph in order to find out what 7 it is .

		Having examined and registered its time-intervals , syncopations , and so forth , they will classify it by one or the other of the above labels .

		The idea is ingenious , but one won - ders if anyone will take the trouble to waste so much time in these hurried days .

		12 THE DIAL
January 1 1	DATE	Let us then leave this atmosphere of ` the labora - tory , and try to find out for ourselves what the poets mean when they talk about vers libre .

		The first point to be noted is that , logically , there can be no such a thing as absolutely free verse , any more than there can be such a thing as absolutely free prose .

		A piece of verse must have a certain form and rhythm , and this form and rhythm must be more rounded , more heightened , more apparent to both eye and ear , than the form and the rhythm of prose .

		Take a corresponding instance from the art of music .

		An aria by
Mozart	ORGANIZATION	may contain two or more distinct melodies , but these are combined together , repeated , ornamented , and finally summed up in such a way that the aria is in itself a distinct and separate whole .

		On the other hand , any long stretch out of Wag - ner 's Ring reveals the fact that there is nothing but a series of linked musical phrases motives we may call them in constant progression .

		Mozart 's method is , then , the method of the poet :
Wagner	PERSON	's is the method of the prose writer .

		This distinction being made , and it is an important one , we may next ask ourselves the question : Why do poets `` speak of vers libre at all ?

		If there can be no verse logically free except verse written with - out form , without rhythm , without balance , which is impossible then why all this fuss over something that does not exist ?

		This very same argument , by the way , appeared in an English journal about a year ago , and I happened to be the only man to reply to it .

		My reply was that the importance of vers libre was that it permitted verse to be not absolutely but relatively free .

		It gave scope for the poet 's own form-constructing ability , but did not hamper him with a stereotyped mold , like the sonnet .

		It per - mitted him to vary the rhythm at discretion , so long as the essential rhythm was preserved .

		To illustrate .

		Here is a short piece of free verse , the structure of which is comparatively simple .

		I have set the accents above the lines in order to show how they fall : I have fled away into deserts , I have hidden myself from you , Lo , you always at my side !

		1 ' ^ can not shake myself free .

		In the frosty evening With your cold eyes you sit watching , Laughing , hungering still for me ; I will open my heart and give you All of my blood , at last .

		The first thing to be noticed about this is that there are exactly the same number of beats in every line that is to say , three .

		The number of syllables between the beats varies so that the incidence of the beat is different , sometimes iambic , sometimes trochaic , sometimes anapaestic , and so on but the first principle of unity , that the number of beats should be the same throughout , is preserved .

		Now to take each line separately .

		The first is comparatively simple , and gives the main beat of the poem .

		This is repeated with slight variation in the second line , and again repeated in the next to the last line : I have fled away into deserts , I have hidden myself from you ... I will open my heart and give you .

		These lines give an effect practically identical ; and herein we have the second principle of unity , the principle of basic rhythm , displayed .

		But what , one may ask , is to be made of the rest of the poem ?

		Here in lines three to eight , and again in the last line of all , there is a group as definitely trochaic and dactylic in formation as the others are iambic and anapaestic .

		Does this not destroy the unity of which you make so much ?

		Not at all .

		With this second group we come pre - cisely to the most important law of vers libre the law of balanced contrast .

		Lines of different metrical origin are used in vers libre precisely as the first and second subjects of a symphony by
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	or
Mozart	PERSON	.

		Let us examine .

		The first line which announces the second subject of the poem is as follows : Lo !

		you always at my side !

		This line is the exact opposite , not only in metrical form , but in mood , to the line announcing the first subject : I have fled away into deserts .

		These two lines between them contain the essence of the poem .

		The rest is variation , amplification , orna - ment .

		For instance : Lo !

		you always at my side ... Laughing , hungering still for me .

		Are not these two lines , separated from each other by four lines of text , of exactly the same metrical pattern ?

		And is not the same theme , with a slightly different middle , repeated in the line `` I can not shake myself free , '' and also with a different close in `` In the frosty evening , '' and also in `` All of my blood at last '' ?

		If I had written : In the frosty evening All of my blood at last Sorrowing and grieving For the vanished past .

		I should have been writing doggerel doubtless , but
1919	DATE	THE DIAI I should have been doing just what the metrists ask poets to do I should have preserved the regularity of incidence which they regard as necessary to poetry .

		How , then , can anyone say , as some have said , that there is no metrical unity to vers libre , no basis of regularity upon which the poem stands ?

		The ` basis is there , but it is concealed .

		Ars est celare artem .

		We can not measure poetry with a metronome , or even classify it with a phonograph , as Dr.
Patterson	PERSON	would have us do .

		There remains one more line to be considered .

		This is : With your cold eyes you sit watching .

		I have marked this line above as having three beats , but it is obvious that this way of reading it may be unpleasant to some people .

		`` With '' is that phe - nomenon , not uncommon in English verse , of a long syllable which is unaccented in itself but which obtains a light stress from the fact that the voice dwells upon it .

		`` Cold '' is probably the same thing .

		One recalls the celebrated line of Macbeth : Toad that under cold stone .

		`` Eyes '' is probably accented also , like `` stone '' in the line just quoted .

		We therefore have : With your cold eyes you sit watching , a reading which gives us four beats or three and a half , if we recognize that the stress upon `` with '' is not so important as that upon `` cold '' or `` eyes '' or `` watching '' and a reading which probably will be more satisfactory to most readers .

		What is important for us to know is that this line is , in a sense , a suspended line , that it partakes some - what of the characteristics of both the first group comprising the first , second , ancf next to the last lines and also of the second group , comprising the rest of the poem .

		It is especially allied to the next to the last line : I will open my heart and give you .

		It needs no expert in verbal music to see that the movement of this is closely paralleled by the move - ment of : With your cold eyes you sit watching .

		We have here , then , what might be called in musical phrases , a resolution .

		The line : With your cold eyes you sit watching is the keystone of the verbal arch we have con - structed .

		It binds the two contrasting subjects , moods , musical phrases , of the poem together and welds them into one .

		We may therefore deduce from this analysis the following laws governing the writing of any piece of vers libre : -LRB- 1 -RRB- A vers libre poem depends , just as a metri - cal poem does , upon uniformity and equality of rhythm ; but this uniformity is not to be sought in an even metronomic succession of beats , but in the contrasted juxtaposition of lines of equal beat value , but of different metrical origin .

		-LRB- 2 -RRB- When a meter in a vers libre poem is re - peated it is usually varied , like the thematic ma - terial of a symphony .

		These variations and nuances are designed largely to take the place of rhyme .

		Rhyme therefore in most cases is undesirable , as it interferes with , rather than assists , the proper ap - preciation of these nuances .

		But occasionally it may be necessary to stress some complex variation , or to hold together the pattern of the poem .

		-LRB- 3 -RRB- Suspensions and resolutions are common .

		The poet writing in vers libre is guided not by any fixed stanza form but by the poem as a whole -LRB- if the poem consists of one strophe , as in the case discussed above -RRB- or by each strophe -LRB- if the poem consists of a number of strophes -RRB- .

		Unity within the bounds of the strophe is his main consideration .

		It will be found in almost every case that the strophe consists of two parts : a rise and a return .

		-LRB- 4 -RRB- Every poet will treat these laws differently .

		Since in English it is open to the poet to write , with equal facility , verses of two , three , four , and five .

		beats , so vers libre in English must necessarily be a more complex and more difficult art than in French , where so much current vers libre is merely modified Alexandrines .

		Every poet will therefore construct his strophes somewhat differently according to his own taste .

		That is what we mean when we speak of `` free verse . ''

		-LRB- 5 -RRB- As for `` spaced prose , '' `` polyphonic prose , '' `` mosaics , '' `` blends '' - and all the other more or less experimental forms which I and others have at - tempted they are not and should not be called verse at all .

		The difference between them and true vers libre is this : vers libre derives from metrical verse and from the old stanza forms .

		Throughout all its variations , unity of rhythmical swing and the dy - namic balance of the strophe is preserved .

		These other forms derive from prose , which does not pos - sess unity of swing and which substitutes for the strophe the paragraph .

		These forms may be con - fused with true vers libre , but the fact remains that the origin of each is different .

		With vers libre the starting-point is the repeated rhythmical phrase ; with these other forms the starting-point is the prose sentence .

GOULD FLETCHER	ORGANIZATION	.

		THE DIAL
January	DATE	u An Educated Heart I F ONE CARED to do so it would be easy to classify Visits to Walt Whitman -LRB- Arens ;
$ 2	MONEY	-RRB- as a partic - ularly aggravated case of
Whitmania	LOCATION	.

		The signs and symptoms are everywhere in evidence : the Pious Pilgrimage , the Dazzling Presence , the Exchange of Tokens , the Inscription of Volumes , the Visit to the Birthplace , the Friends , and the Friends of the Friends all intermixed with those chronicles of conversational small beer which appear to constitute the technique of latter-day hero worship .

		But to dwell solely on this aspect of the book would be to betray a callousness to human values of a particularly rare and precious sort .

		Not often are we intro - duced into such a company of educated hearts , nor permitted glimpses of the beauty and dignity of meek and obscure lives .

		Aside from any positive value the book may have as a contribution to our knowledge and understand - ing of one of the few great figures which our un - kempt civilization has produced , it has the merit of vividly rendering that civilization itself , or rather that segment of it to which Whitman belonged dur - ing the latter part of his life .

		In other words the figure of the man is shown against its appropriate background , and though that background contains such things as a sheet-iron stove , a stuffed canary under glass , and two miniature statues of
Grover Cleveland	LOCATION	by an unknown hand , these and other horrors only assure us of the authenticity of the portrait give it perfect verisimilitude .

		In contrast with such esthetic squalor the human kindliness and spiritual grandeur of Whitman stand out in just such dramatic relief as
Lincoln	LOCATION	's black frock coat and stovepipe hat must have imparted to his seamed and sad face .

		Such things make us thrillingly aware of the grotesque lacunae to which greatness as well as littleness is subject like
Emerson	PERSON	's love of pie for breakfast , and the Hawthornes ' cherishing of their haircloth sofa .

		Whitman and his circle are focused for us in binocular vision , as it were , by two Englishmen , Dr.
John Johnston	PERSON	and
J. W. Wallace	PERSON	, drawn to our shores in quest of the great adventure of meet - ing face to face one known already mind to mind and heart to heart .

		The journey was undertaken in the spirit of those pilgrimages made by
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	religious devotees to the ashrama of some Master , and the two men appear to have derived from it the same order of spiritual refreshment .

		They describe
Whitman	PERSON	's environment , his dress , his ap - pearance , his moods , aod his conversation with meticulous and loving care , omitting nothing .

		Al - though the performance is without conscious art , no master realist could better it .

		The frail , wise , tender old man in his wheel chair lives before us ;
Mickle	PERSON	street , Camden town , and the little clap - boarded house shouldered in between its loftier neighbors assume , with the aid of photographs , extraordinary distinctness , and the people who go in and out acquire the interest of characters in a play or in a tale .

		Whitman 's recorded talk is not remarkable , being largely made up of the ordinary small change of conversation , but he possessed the power of vign - etting with a few telling strokes a whole life history , so that we seem to know all that is neces - sary for complete understanding .

		His account of his friend Mrs.
Gilchrist	PERSON	's daughter
Beatrice	PERSON	is an example of this power : She decided that
Beatrice	PERSON	, the daughter , should be a doctor a lady , woman doctor .

		There were no colleges for women in
England	LOCATION	, and she brought her over along with the rest of the family to
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, where there was the best medical college for women in the country .

		In time , however ,
Beatrice	PERSON	came to dislike her pro- fession .

		Her weakness had always been what may be called an excess of veracity .

		She would not do , or be , or seem anything that was not strictly true or veracious .

		And she declared that doctors could not , as a rule , find out what really ailed people , and she would not be one .

		One night she disappeared , and , from certain indica - tions , it was feared that she had committed suicide or something .

		A search was made , but no trace was found .

		At last , some months after , her body was found in a wood , with her clothes and fixings much battered and decayed .

		Another instance of this ability to condense the content of what might be a book into the limits of a paragraph is seen in
Whitman	LOCATION	's story of the life of
Peter Doyle	PERSON	, the baggageman , up to the time when his visits suddenly and mysteriously ceased : He is a good friend of mine .

		He was born in
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		His mother and father came out here when he was a little chap of four or five a bright-eyed little fellow and the sailors took to him a good deal , as sailors do .

		They went to
Richmond	LOCATION	and lived there .

		His father was a machinist .

		His mother was a good specimen , I guess , of an Irish woman of that class .

		Pete grew up there till he was a young fellow , a big boy of sixteen or seventeen .

		When the War broke out he joined the Southern army and was a rebel soldier .

		He was wounded by our troops and made prisoner , and brought to Wash - ington .

		The doctors got him over his wound , and he went out and got a job as tram-conductor .

		And it was then that I met him first .

		I do n't know whether you know or not the horrible monotony and irksomeness of the hospital to a young fellow recovering .

		So , as soon as they can , the doctors let them out , and they have to report themselves till they are quite well .

		Well ,
Pete	PERSON	was out in this way .

		We became acquainted and very good friends .

		The house in
Washington	LOCATION	was broken up .

		His father did n't
1919	DATE	THE DIAL get work , did n't get success : so he went away to
New York	LOCATION	where he thought he would succeed , and that was the last that was heard of him .

		No doubt he was drowned or killed .

		His mother died a year or two ago .

		And his uncle , his mother 's brother
Nash	PERSON	whom I used to know is dead .

		So I do n't know where
Pete	PERSON	is now .

		Whitman 's comments on the great figures of liter - ature are unfailingly shrewd :
Carlyle	PERSON	`` lacks amor - ousness '' ; Arnold is `` more demonstrable , genial , than the typical
John Bull	PERSON	'' ;
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is `` the poet of great personalities '' but it is only when he comes to speak of the people of `` these states '' that he becomes truly clairvoyant : The Americans are given to smartness and money-getting , and there is danger of over-smartness .

		I 'm not afraid of it , it will come out all right , but the tendency is to become daemonic , to cheat one 's own father and mother , to be damned smart , to gouge ... Our leading men are not of much account , and never have been , but the average of the people is immense , beyond all History .

		This is his comment on the American boys .

		Let us hope that the war may have saved the present generation of them from the `` gentility '' that he deplores : Have you noticed what fine boys the American boys are ?

		Their distinguishing feature is their good - naturedness and good temper with each other .

		You never hear them quarrel , nor even get to high words .

		Given a chance , they would develop the heroic and manly ; but they will be spoiled by civilization , religion , and damnable conventions .

		Their parents want them to grow up genteel everybody wants to be genteel in
America	LOCATION	and thus their heroic qualities will simply be crushed out of them .

		His estimate of the power and influence of Leaves of Grass is high , but who shall say that it is exag - gerated ?

		If the book lives and becomes a power , it will be under - stood better in fifty or a hundred years than now .

		For it needs people to grow up with it ... As to the Leaves , their aim is Character : what I sometimes call
Heroism Heroicism	ORGANIZATION	.

		Some of my friends say it is a sane , strong physiology ; I hope it is .

		But physiology is a secondary matter .

		Not to depict great personalities , .

		or to describe events and passions , but to arouse that some - thing in the reader which we call Character .

		No truer estimate than the above has ever been made of Whitman 's unique force and function .

		We do not go to him for pleasure , for amusement , for solace ` or instruction , but for inspiration to become what we are !

		CLAUDE
BRAGDON	PERSON	.

		A Normal Madness 7 WAS AN unfortunate inspiration which led the daughter of
Anne Gilchrist	PERSON	to write in advance to the
London	LOCATION	Nation a letter protesting against the title of the forthcoming publication of her mother 's correspondence with
Walt Whitman	PERSON	.

		Her mistake consisted literally in the fact that she was speaking without the book .

		In the first place the volume is neutrally entitled The Letters of
Anne Gilchrist	PERSON	and
Walt Whitman	PERSON	-LRB-
Doubleday	ORGANIZATION	, Page ;
$ 2	MONEY	-RRB- , and not the `` Love Letters , '' as she has heard it was to be headed ; and in the second place , so far as her mother 's letters are concerned and they practically compose the volume to call them merely `` love - letters '' is to understate the case .

		Yet with a strange confidence the daughter of Mrs.
Gilchrist	PERSON	risked this positive statement concerning letters she had never seen : `` I can safely say that though my mother was a warm admirer of Whitman 's writings , .

		the poet himself entertaining a hearty regard and friend - ship for her , the correspondence which passed be ^ tween the two would in no sense ^ lend itself to the suggestion of the title of the proposed book . ''

		The episode might well serve as a warning to all daugh - ters that they can not safely say anything about their mothers ' love affairs until all the returns are in .

		The mothers of this generation are wisely beginning to learn that the adolescent daughter has her own private soul ; but it remains for the next generation to learn that middle age too has its secrets .

		`` I wrote that long letter out in the
Autumn	LOCATION	fields for dear life 's sake , '' wrote
Anne Gilchrist	PERSON	to
Walt Whitman	PERSON	of her first message to him .

		It was indeed no mere demand but an ultimate compulsion that moved her .

		Mrs.
Gilchrist	PERSON	's letters need no apologist .

		She takes her place beside those vivid spirits like
Mary Wollstonecraft	PERSON	and
Madame Curie	PERSON	in whom in - tellect and passion strive equally for fulfillment .

		Her emotionalism is always clear-sighted .

		Like
Mary Wollstonecraft	PERSON	, who during her most infatu - ated pursuit of
Imlay	PERSON	still remained a keen daily observer of the economics of the French Revolution ,
Anne Gilchrist	PERSON	's obsessional attachment to Whitman had its rational counterpart in her faithful devotion to science and the scientific point of view which for her the poet represented / She was in love with reality as she was in love with the poet whose words `` indicate the path between reality and the soul . ''

		Throughout all the storm and stress of personal yearnings and disappointments she remained a dis - cerning analyst of the work of the beloved .

		It is interesting to compare the two essays on Walt Whit - man reprinted in this volume .

		The first was written in
1869	DATE	just after the poems had fallen into Mrs.
Gilchrist	PERSON	's hands for the first time ; the
second fifteen years later	DATE	, and after the Gilchrists ' sojourn in
America	LOCATION	.

		Though the fiery enthusiasm of the first is lacking at fifty-six , the fidelity of the later to the earlier impressions is truly remarkable .

		i6 THE DIAL
January	DATE	n By far the most interesting part of this book consists of the letters written between the
fall of 1871	DATE	and the
fall of 1876	DATE	, beginning with the one which was written in the `` Autumn fields for dear life 's sake . ''

		Here you may study at a safe dis - tance what
Freud	ORGANIZATION	describes as `` the state of being in love , so remarkable psychologically , and the nor - mal prototype of the psychoses . ''


Anne Gilchrist	PERSON	had been a widow for eight years , absorbed in do - mestic cares , in the upbringing of four young chil - dren , and in the completion of her husband 's unfin - ished literary tasks , when she first met Whitman 's poems .

		`` I had not dreamed that words could cease to be words , and become electric streams like these , '' she wrote to
Michael Rossetti	PERSON	, who had loaned her the book .

		And from that time forth the spell did not abate .

		With great accuracy and genuine poetical abandon this patient is able to describe the symptoms .

		For that I have never set eyes upon thee , all the
Atlantic	LOCATION	flowing between us , yet cleave closer than those that stand nearest and dearest around thee love thee day and night last thoughts , first thoughts , my soul 's pas - sionate yearning towards thy divine soul , every hour , every deed and thought my love for my ` children , my hopes , aspirations for them , all taking new shape , new height through this great love .

		My soul has staked all upon it .

		Whitman 's kind but discouraging responses only served to fan the flame .

		She offers her all to him ; she prays to minister to his wants , to shafe her income with him , to take upon herself the attacks of his def amers , to bear him children ; she covets the Liebestod with him .

		If God were to say to me , `` See , he that you love you shall not be given to in this life he is going to set sail on the unknown sea will you go with him ? ''

		never yet has bride sprung into her husband 's arms with the joy with which I would take thy hand and
spring	DATE	from the shore .

		In return she demands nothing , not even replies to her letters .

		Pathetically she hits upon an expedi - ent to relieve her wistful longing to know whether her letters are received or not .

		He is to post her an American newspaper on receipt of each letter .

		Whitman seems to have committed himself to this extent .

		As time went on the passionate letter writer was visited by moments of insight .

		It may be that this shaping of my life course toward you will have to be all inward , that ... the grate - ful , tender love growing ever deeper and stronger out of that will have to go dumb and actionless all my days here .

		There were letters that she destroyed after re - lieving her ardent soul in writing them a method which , by the way , is highly recommended by
Crete Meissel-Hess	ORGANIZATION	in The Sexual Crisis .

		But such mo - ments were all too rare for the lady 's own good .

		The erotic spell persisted for seven long years , leading her at last to
America	LOCATION	, against Whitman 's emphatic disapproval and determined efforts to pre - vent the journey .

		It turned out much better than Whitman evidently , and with reason , feared .

		Dur - ing her residence in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	the relation settled down into one of permanent and loyal friendship , and this is the tone which characterized the cor - respondence following that period .

		The letters give us no .

		clue as to why Mrs.
Gilchrist	PERSON	spent the latter half of her American sojourn in
Boston	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	instead of in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, nor can we discover from them the real reason for her return to
England	LOCATION	.

		Perhaps `` the children '' did not like it , after all , in the Promised Land which failed to realize the ideals of democracy expressed in
Whitman	LOCATION	's poetry ; per - haps
Anne Gilchrist	PERSON	learned of her rival in the poet 's affections ; but most likely of all she realized that the cycle was complete .

		She died in
1885	DATE	, seven years before the invalid poet made an end .

		She did not live to see old age ; probably her emo - tional struggles , as was the case with
Mary Woll	PERSON	- stonecraft , helped to shorten her life .

		The volume contains very few letters from
Walt Whitman	PERSON	.

		All the others , as Mrs.
Gilchrist	PERSON	's daughter communicates , are in her possession .

		On the whole , one does not regret that they have escaped publication .

		The few specimens givep , as the editor remarks , probably reflect the tone of them all .

		While no man could be expected to do anything but retreat before such ecstasies of self-surrender , the human male who would not feel some com - placency in such a situation probably does not exist .

		All things considered , Whitman seems to have borne himself admirably throughout the long ordeal .

		A delicate obligation to him was involved in the pub - lication of these letters , of which the literary exec - utor seems to have been happily unconscious .

		Other - wise he would not insist that the chief value of the collection lies in its being a `` tribute '' to the personality of ``
America	LOCATION	's most unique man of genius . ''

		The letters have a value in themselves quite apart from the genius of the man who in - spired them .

		Emotions of the kind that possessed
Anne Gilchrist	PERSON	have the power to convert almost any person of the opposite sex into a `` most unique '' object .

		After all , these letters contribute nothing very important or significant to the biography of Walt Whitman ; but they do contribute a great deal to the psychology of romantic love and to the biography of the romantic lover who resides some - where is the psyche of each of us .

		KATHARINE ANTHONY .

		1919 The Rise of the `` Unskilled IHERE ARE MANY reasons which make the organi - zation of skilled workers in Trade Unions far easier than that of the less skilled .

		The skilled workmen are better paid and can therefore more easily afford to make a regular contribution .

		Moreover they often pay a high contribution , receiving in return not only dispute benefit but also insurance against unemployment , sickness , and old age ; and whatever the disadvantages of the mingling of `` friendly '' and fighting activities may be , it undoubtedly conduces to stability and permanence of organization , as well as to conservatism of spirit .

		Yet again , the skilled workers have a closer bond of craft pride and craft interest than is possible for the less skilled workers .

		This of course is commonplace .

		What needs ex - plaining is not the fact that organization has usually been weak among the less skilled workers , but the fact that during the years preceding the war and still more during the war period it has made remark - able strides .

		The number of members in the `` gen - eral labor '' Unions in
Great Britain	LOCATION	, which rep - resent principally this type of workers , rose from 118,000 in
1910	DATE	to 366,000 in
1914	DATE	, and the total is now something - like 800,000 .

		Why has this extraordinary growth taken place ?

		The principal explanation of the pre-war growth lies in the increasing prevalence of industrial unrest during the years preceding the war .

		Industrial un - rest , which some call `` the swing of the pendulum '' of public opinion from political to industrial action , always means , naturally , a large accession to
Trade Union	ORGANIZATION	membership .

		To this must be added as a further cause the fact that the sharp line of cleavage between the skilled and the unskilled was gradually being blurred , and that the tendency of machinery and management was towards the creation of a growing body of semi-skilled workers , recruited from the ranks of the unskilled , who encroached on the trades of the skilled workers and at the same time very greatly reduced the proportion of really un - skilled workers in industry .

		Together with the growth of `` semi-skill , '' went a tendency towards organization , not so strong as that of the skilled workers , but still appreciable and definite .

		The creation of `` semi-skill '' was , of course , a proc - ess enormously accelerated by the war .

		Practically all the pre-war workers in the war industries were absorbed into jobs which were at least semi-skilled , and the lower ranges of jobs were more and more filled either by newcomers to industry , whether girls or adults , or by workers transferred from inessential or `` sweated '' trades .

		The whole body of semi - skilled and unskilled workers gained greatly in status as a result of war conditions .

		Also their pay in most cases increased ; and even where this increase was offset by the rise in the cost of living , the ex - penditure of a few pence weekly on
Trade Union	ORGANIZATION	membership seemed a far smaller thing than before .

		At the same time a common consciousness began to grow up among the less skilled workers .

		They found the attitude of the old-established Unions toward them often hard and unsympathetic , because the skilled men often felt that the less skilled were doing them out of their jobs , and feared the cutting of rates by their competition in the crafts .

		The general labor Unions therefore grew , as it were , fac - ing both ways .

		They confronted the employers with demands for better conditions , but they also con - fronted the skilled Unions with claims for better consideration .

		Their consciousness of their common opportunity and their common danger in industry took the place of craft spirit and acted as a powerful incentive to combination .

		It is still an open question how far this conscious - ness , and the organization which has sprung from it , will survive the shock of the return to peace-time conditions .

		Severe unemployment or dislocation is likely at once to show its effect in a reduced mem - bership in the general labor Unions .

		This type of membership has always been peculiarly unstable , and there are many who prophesy that it will not outlast the special conditions which called it into being .

		I do not know , but I believe that enough of it will survive to be a powerful factor during the coming years of reconstruction .

		What , then , is the relation which this mass of newly organized workers bears , and is likely to bear , to the older established Trade Unions , and to the rank and file movements which I discussed in my last article ?

		Clearly , there are large possible diver - gences of attitude between them , and these di - vergences , without wise handling , may easily become divergences of actual policy .

		The official Trade Unionism of the skilled workers is apt to ignore , if not to repudiate , the claims of the less skilled .

		Its members have patri - otically suspended during the war their customs and regulations , which it had cost them more than half a century of struggle to establish .

		They have received in return an absolute promise from the Government that these customs and regulations will be restored intact at the end of the war .

		To the redemption of that pledge they are clearly entitled ; but their rea - soning is apt to stop at that point , and to pay too i8 THE DIAL
January 11	DATE	little regard to the practical expediencies and exigencies of the situation .

		The less skilled workers , on the other hand , con - scious both of pre-war repression and of war-time service , are likely to adopt the standpoint of mean - ing to hold their gains , J' y suis : j' y reste .

		Some of them say in effect to the skilled workers : `` We could not trust our interests in your hands before the war , and we can not trust them now .

		The war has brought us into a position from which you self - ishly excluded us before the war , and we are not prepared , because pledges have been given which do not bind us , to revert to our pre-war condition of servitude and inferiority . ''

		The case is not always so plainly stated , but that is the case , reduced to its essential elements .

		Clearly this is a position which presents consider - able dangers to the
Trade Union	ORGANIZATION	movement .

		If the skilled and the less skilled workers spend time and effort in these internal struggles , the employers will reconstruct industry according to their own plans , and Labor will have no effective voice in its recon - struction .

		This point however must not be pressed too far .

		It is still possible , and even likely , that the official Trade Unionism of the skilled workers and the official Trade Unionism of the less skilled , realizing their common danger , will reach at least a temporary agreement and meet the employers with a common program , in which each will concede something to the other .

		This is strongly to be hoped ; and for this the best elements in both sections are working .

		But even if a temporary agreement is reached , and skilled and less skilled cooperate effectively in deal - ing with the problems of reconstruction , there will still remain big differences between them which it is essential to transcend if the recurrence of trouble is to be avoided .

		The plain fact is that while the Trade Unionism of the skilled workers is built upon a basis of craft which excludes and antagonizes the unskilled , the Trade Unionism of the less skilled workers is largely based upon this antagonism , at least in the minds of many of the leaders .

		To mention only two of the most prominent , Mr.
J. R. Clynes	PERSON	of the
General Workers	ORGANIZATION	and Mr.
J. N. Bell	PERSON	of the
National Amal	ORGANIZATION	- gamated
Union of Labor	ORGANIZATION	have both dwelt frequently upon the function of the general labor
Union	ORGANIZATION	in protecting the less skilled workers , not only against the employers , but against the skilled workers .

		The two forms of organization are thus built upon ideas which are mutually exclusive and partly antagonistic .

		This means that in neither is there any resting place .

		The idea of craft and the idea of `` no-craft '' are alike inadequate to fit modern industrial condi - tions or to combine into a common program of a lasting kind .

		The need is for a bigger idea , and for a bigger basis of combination , to replace both alike .

		We saw , in the last article , that the `` rank and file '' movement , which has its origin and its main strength among the skilled workers , is largely based on the repudiation of the `` craft '' principle and on the assertion of the rival principles of class and in - dustry .

		We saw also that a considerable `` rank and file '' movement exists among the less skilled workers , though it is not so strongly organized as are the shop stewards of the skilled trades .

		The main difference is that , whereas the younger skilled workers tend to favor the combination in one Union of all the work - ers in a particular industry , whatever their degree of skill , the unskilled are led by their present form of association , which extends over most industries , to look forward rather to the combination in one Union of all workers , without regard to skill or industry .

		Reconciliation of these two problems is by no means impossible ; but the difference of attitude is at present a barrier to effective common action and to the unity of all - the advanced forces .

		Union by class the One
Big Union	ORGANIZATION	idea in - volves too sharp a break with the present to be im - mediately practicable .

		Union by industry can hardly be accomplished , in some industries at least , in face of the present strength of the general labor Unions .

		The moral seems to be that the process of consolida - tion must be pushed as far as possible in each camp separately on the official side , and that in the shop steward and workshop committee movement the two must find their immediate field for common action and for propaganda .

		In the end , I believe that the One
Big Union	ORGANIZATION	idea will prove to be the only way of straightening out the tangle of
British Trade Union	ORGANIZATION	organization ; but the time for that is not yet .

		It may be a matter for surprise that in this article I have said nothing about the women workers as a distinct factor .

		The truth is that only in one respect can they be regarded as a distinct factor : generally speaking the women in the war trades count mainly as a section of the less-skilled workers , a majority of those who are organized being found in the general labor Unions which admit both sexes , and only a minority , though an active one , in the
National Fed	ORGANIZATION	- eration of Women Workers .

		The respect in which the position of some women is different from that of the less skilled men is that , as the men have passed from the unskilled to the semi-skilled grades , the women have in many cases taken their place on un - skilled work , though many women have of course been employed on semi-skilled and even on skilled jobs .

		The unskilled women and girls hold their
1919	DATE	THE DIAL position in the vital industries only precariously , and are unlikely to count for much as a factor in recon - struction .

		They must be considered and provided for ; but they will not exercise any considerable force .

		Men 's and women 's interests will not diverge in any important respect : the real cleavage that needs heal - ing is that between the skilled and the less skilled workers .

		This I believe can and will be temporarily met by mutual concessions ; but it can only be met permanently by the emergence of a broader spirit and the achievement of a more comprehensive form of organization .

		G D H CQLE The Modern Point of View and the New Order VII LIVE AND LET LIVE IHE NATION 'S inalienable right of self-direction and self-help is of the same nature and derivation as the like inalienable right of self-help vested in an irresponsible king by the grace of God .

		In both cases alike it is a divine right , in the sense that it is irresponsible and will not bear scrutiny , being an arbitrary right of self-help at the cost of any whom it may concern .

		There is the further parallel that in both cases alike the ordinary exercise of these rights confers no material benefit on the underlying community .

		In practical effect the exercise of such divine rights , whether by a sovereign monarch or by the officials of a sovereign nation , works damage and discomfort to one and another , within the na - tional frontiers or beyond them , with nothing better to show for it than some relatively slight gain in prestige or in wealth for some relatively small group of privileged persons or vested interests .

		And the gain of those who profit by this means is always got at the cost of the common man at home and abroad .

		These inalienable rights are an abundant source of grievances to be redressed at the cost of the common man .

		It has long been a stale commonplace that the quarrels of competitive kings in pursuit of their di - vine rights have brought nothing but damage and discomfort to the peoples whose material wealth and man power have been made use of for national enter - prise of this kind .

		And it is no less evident , though perhaps less notorious , that the pursuit of national advantages by competitive nations by use of the same material wealth and man power unavoidably brings nothing better than the same net output of damage and discomfort to all the peoples concerned .

		There is of course the reservation that in the one case the kings and their accomplices and pensioners have come in for some gain in prestige and in perquisites , while in the case of the competitive nations certain vested interests and certain groups of the kept classes stand to gain something in the way of perquisites and free income ; but always and in the nature of the case the total gain is less than the cost , and always the gain goes to the kept classes and the cost falls on the common man .

		So much is notorious , particularly so far as it is a question of material gain and loss .

		So far as it is an immaterial question of jealousy and prestige , the line of division runs between nations , but as regards material gain and loss it is always a division between the kept classes and the common man ; and always the common man has more to lose than the kept classes stand to gain .

		The war is now concluded , provisionally , and peace is in prospect for the immediate future , also provisionally .

		As is true between individuals , so also among the nations , peace means the same thing as Live and Let Live , which also means the same thing as a world made safe for democracy .

		And the rule of Live and Let Live means the discontinuance of animosity and discrimination between the nations .

		Therefore it involves the disallowance of such in - compatible national pretensions as are likely to afford ground for international grievances which comes near involving the disallowance of all those claims and perquisites that habitually go in under the captions of `` national self-determination '' and `` na - tional integrity , '' as these phrases are employed in diplomatic intercourse .

		At the same time it involves the disallowance of all those class pretensions and vested interests that make for dissension within the nation .

		Ill will is not a practicable basis of peace , whether within the nation or between the nations .

		So much is plain matter of course .

		What may be the chances of peace and war , at home and abroad , in the light of these blunt and obvious principles taken in conjunction with the diplomatic negotiations now going forward at home and abroad all that is sufficiently perplexing .

		At home in
America	LOCATION	for the transient time being , the war administration has under pressure of neces - sity somewhat loosened the strangle-hold of the vested interests on the country 's industry ; and in so doing it has shocked the safe and sane business men THE DIAL
January	DATE	n into a state of indignant trepidation and has at the same time doubled the country 's industrial output .

		But all that has avowedly been only for the transient time being , `` for the period of the war , '' as a dis - tasteful concession to demands that would not wait .

		So that the country now faces a return to the pre - carious conditions of a provisional peace on the lines of the status quo ante .

		Already the vested interests are again tightening their hold and are busily ar - ranging for a return to business as usual ; which means working at cross-purposes as usual , waste of work and materials as usual , restriction of output as usual , unemployment as usual , labor quarrels as usual , competitive selling as usual , mendacious ad - vertising as usual , waste of superfluities as usual by the kept classes , and privation as usual for the com - mon man .

		All of which may conceivably be put up with by this people `` lest a worse evil befall . ''

		All this runs blamelessly in under the rule of Live and Let Live as interpreted in the light of those en - lightened principles of self-help that go to make up the modern point of view and the established scheme of law and order , although it does not meet the needs of the same rule as it would be enforced by the exigencies of the new order in industry .

		Meanwhile , abroad , the gentlemen of the old school who direct the affairs of the nations are laying down the lines on which peace is to be established and maintained , with a painstaking regard for all those national pretensions and discriminations that have always made for international embroilment , and with an equally painstaking disregard for , all those exigencies of the new order that call for a de facto observance of the rule of Live and Let Live .

		It is notorious beyond need of specification that the new order in industry , even more insistently than any industrial situation that has gone before , calls for a wide and free intercourse in trade and in - dustry , regardless of national frontiers and national jealousies .

		In this connection a national frontier , as it is commonly made use of in current state - craft , is a line of demarkation for working at cross - purposes , for mutual obstruction and distrust .

		It is only necessary to recall that the erection of a new national frontier across any community which has previously enjoyed the privilege of free intercourse unburdened with customs frontiers will be felt to be a grievous burden , and that the erection of such a line of demarkation for other diplomatic work at mutual cross-purposes is likewise an unmistakable nuisance .

		Yet in the peace negotiations now going forward the gentlemen of the old school to whom the affairs of the nations have been `` entrusted '' by shrewd management on their own part continue to safe - guard all this apparatus of mutual defeat and dis - trust and indeed this is the chief or sole object of their solicitude , as it also is the chief or sole object of these vested interests for whose benefit the diplo - matic gentlemen of the old school continue to manage the affairs of the nations .

		The state of the case is plainly to be seen in the proposals of those nationalities that are now coming forward with a new claim to national self-determina - tion .

		Invariably any examination of the bill of particulars set up by the spokesmen of these proposed new national establishments will show that the material point of it all is an endeavor to set up a national apparatus for working at mutual cross - purposes with their neighbors , to add something to the waste and confusion caused by the national dis - criminations already in force , to violate the rule of Live and Let Live at some n ^ ew point and by some further apparatus of discomfort .

		There are nationalities that get along well enough , to all appearance , without being `` nations '' in that militant and obstructive fashion that is aimed at in these projected creations of the diplomatic nation-makers .

		Such are the Welsh and the Scotch , for instance .

		But it is not the object-lesson of Welsh or Scottish experience that guides the new projects .

		The nationalities which are now escaping from a rapacious imperialism of the old order are being organized and managed by the safe and sane gentlemen of the old school , who have got their notions of safety and sanity from the diplomatic intrigue of that outworn imperialism out of which these oppressed nationalities aim to escape .

		And these gentlemen of the old school are making no move in the direction of tolerance and good will - as how should they when all their conceptions of what is right and expedient are the diplomatic pre - conceptions of the old regime .

		They , being gentle - men of the old school , will have none of that amica - ble and unassuming nationality which contents the Welsh and the Scotch , who have tried out this mat - ter and have in the end come to hold fast only so much of their national pretensions as will do no material harm .

		What is aimed at is not a disallow - ance of bootless national jealousies , but only a shift from an intolerable imperialism on a large scale to an ersatz-emperialism drawn on a smaller scale , con - ducted on the same general lines of competitive diplomacy and serving interests of the same general kind vested interests of business or of privilege .

		The projected new nations are not patterned on the Welsh or the Scottish model , but for all that there is nothing novel in their design ; and how should there be when they are the offspring of the imagination of these safe and sane gentlemen of
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 21 the old school fertilized with the ancient concep - tions of imperialistic diplomacy and national pres - tige ?

		In effect it is all drawn to the scale and pattern already made famous by the Balkan states .

		It should also be safe to presume that the place and value of these newly emerging nations in the comity of peoples under the prospective regime of pro- visional peace will be something not notably different from what the Balkan states have habitually placed on view which may be deprecated by many well - meaning persons , but which is scarcely to be undone by well-wishing .

		The chances of war and politics have thrown the fortunes of these projected new nations into the hands of these politic gentlemen of the old school , and by force of inveterate habit these very .

		practical persons are unable to conceive that anything else than a Balkan state is fit to take the place of that imperial rule that has now fallen into decay .

		So Balkan-state national establishments ap - pear to be the best there is in prospect in the new world of safe democracy .

		So true is this that even in those instances , such as the Finns and other fragments of the Russian im - perial dominions , where a ' newly emerging nation has set out to go on its way without taking pains to safeguard the grievances of the old order even in these instances that should seem to concern no one but themselves , the gentlemen of the old school who guard the political institutions of the old order in the world at large find it impossible to keep their hands off and to let these adventurous pilgrims of hope go about their own business in their own way .

		Self-determination proves to be insufferable if it partakes of the new order rather than of the old , at least so long as the safe and sane gentlemen of the old school can hinder it by any means at their command .

		It is felt that the vested interests which underlie the gentlemen of the old school would not be sufficiently secure in the keeping of these unshorn and unshaven pilgrims of hope , and the doubt may be well taken .

		So that , within the intellectual hori - zon of the practical statesmen , the only safe , sane , and profitable manner of national establishment and national policy for these newcomers is something after the familiar fashion of the Balkan states ; and it may also be admitted quite broadly that these newly arriving peoples commonly are content to seek their national fortunes along precisely these Balkan - state lines , though the Finns and their like are per - haps to be counted as an unruly exception to the rule .

		These Balkan states , whose spirit , aims , and ways are so admirable in the eyes of the gentlemanly keepers of the old political and economic order , are simply a case of imperialism in the raw .

		They are all and several still in the pickpocket stage of dynas - tic statemaking , comparable with the state of
Prus	PERSON	- sia before
Frederick	PERSON	the Great Pickpocket came to the throne .

		And now , with much sage counsel from the safe and sane statesmen of the status quo ante , Czechs , Slovaks , Slovenes , Ruthenians , Ukrainians , Croats , Poles and Polaks are breathlessly elbowing their way into line with these minuscular
Machiavel	PERSON	- lians .

		Quite unchastened by ' their age-long experi - ence in adversity they are all alike clamoring for national establishments stocked up with all the time-tried contrivances for discomfort and defeat .

		With one hand they are making frantic gestures of distress for an `` outlet to the sea '' by means of which to escape obstruction of their over-seas trade by their nationally minded neighbors , while with the other hand they are feverishly at work to contrive a customs frontier of their own together with other devices for obstructing their neighbors ' trade and their own , so soon as they shall have any trade to obstruct .

		Such is the force of habit and tradition .

		In other words , these peoples are aiming to become nations in full standing .

		And all the while it is plain to all men that a national `` outlet to the sea '' has no meaning in time of peace and in the absence of national governments working at cross-purposes .

		Which comes near to saying that the sole material object of these new projects in nation-making is to work at cross-pur - poses with their neighbors across the new-found national frontiers .

		So also it is plain that this mutual working at cross-purposes between the na - tions hinders the keeping of the peace , even when it is all mitigated with all the approved apparatus of diplomatic make-believe , compromise , and intrigue just as it is plain that the peace is not to be kept by use of armaments , but all the while national arma - ments are also included as an indispensable adjunct of national life , in the projects of these new nations of the Balkan pattern .

		The right to carry arms is an inalienable right of national self-determination and an indispensable means of self-help , as under - stood by these nation-makers of the old school .

		So also it is plain that national pretensions in the field of foreign trade and investment , and all the diver - sified expedients for furthering and protecting the profitable enterprise of the vested interests in foreign parts , run consistently at cross-purposes with the keeping of the peace .

		And all the while the rule of Live and Le ' t Live , as it works out within the framework of the new industrial order , will not tolerate these things .

		But the rule of Live and Let Live , which embodies the world 's hope of peace on earth and a practicable modicum of good will among men , is not of the essence of that timeworn statesmanship which is 22 THE DIAL
January 1 1	DATE	now busily making the world safe for the vested interests .

		Neglect and disallowance of those things that make for embroilment does not enter into the counsels of the nation-makers or of those stupendous figures of veiled statecraft that now move in the background and are shaping the destinies of these and other nations with a view to the status quo ante .

		All these peoples that now hope to be nations have long been nationalities .

		A nation is an organization for collective offense and defense , in peace and war essentially based on hate and fear of other na - tions ; a nationality is a cultural group , bound to - gether by home-bred affinities of language , tradition , use and wont , and commonly also by a supposed community of race essentially based on sympathies and sentiments of self-complacency within itself .

		The Welsh and the Scotch are nationalities , more or less well defined , although they are not nations in the ordinary meaning of the word ; so also are the Irish , with a difference , and such others as the Finns and the Armenians .

		The American republic is a nation , but not a nationality in any full measure .

		The Welsh and the Scotch have learned the wisdom of Live and Let Live , within the peace of the Em - pire , and they are not moving to break bounds and set up a national integrity after the Balkan pattern .

		The case of the Irish is peculiar ; at least so they say .

		They , that is to say the Irish by sentiment rather than by domicile , the Irish people as con - trasted with the vested interests of Ulster , of the landlords , of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, and of the bureaucracy these Irish have long been a nationality and are now mobilizing all their force to set up a Balkan state , autonomous and defensible , within the formal bounds of the Empire or without .

		Their case is peculiar and instructive .

		It throws a light on the margin of tolerance , of what the traffic will bear , beyond which an increased pressure on a subject population will bring no added profit to the vested interests for whose benefit the pressure is brought to bear .

		It is a case of the Common Man hard ridden in due legal form by the vested interests of the
Island	LOCATION	, and of the neighboring island , which are duly backed by an alien and biased bureaucracy aided and abetted by the priestly pickpockets of the poor .

		So caught in this way between the devil and the deep sea , it is small wonder if they choose in the end to follow counsels of desperation and are mov - ing to throw their lot into the deep sea of national self-help and international intrigue .

		They have reached the point where they have ceased to say : `` It might have been worse . ''

		The case of the Finns , Jews , and Armenians is not greatly different in gen - eral effect .

		It is easy to fall into a state of perturbation about the evil case of the submerged , exploited , and op - pressed minor nationalities ; and it is not unusual to jump to the conclusion that national self-determina - tion will surely mend their evil case .

		National self - determination and national integrity are words to conjure with , and there is no denying that very substantial results have been known to follow from such conjuring .

		But self-determination is not a sovereign remedy , particularly not as regards the material conditions of life for the common man , for that somewhat more than nine-tenths of the popula - tion who always finally have to bear the cost of any national establishment .

		It has been tried , and the point is left in doubt .

		So the case of
Belgium	LOCATION	or of
Serbia	LOCATION	during the past four years has been scarcely less evil than that of the Armenians or the Poles .


Belgium	LOCATION	and
Serbia	LOCATION	were nations , in due form , very much after the pattern aimed at in the new pro- jected nations already spoken of , whereas the Ar - menians and the Poles have been subject minor nationalities .


Belgium	LOCATION	,
Serbia	LOCATION	, and
Poland	LOCATION	have been subject to the ravages of an imperial power which claims rank as a civilized people , whereas the Armenians have been manhandled by the Turks .

		So again , the Irish are a subject minor nationality , whereas the Roumanians are a nation in due form .

		In fact the Roumanians are just such a Balkan state as the Irish aspire to become .

		But no doubt the common man is appreciably worse off in his ma - terial circumstances in
Roumania	LOCATION	than in
Ireland	LOCATION	.


Japan	LOCATION	, too , is not only a self-determining nation with a full charge of national integrity , but it is a Great Power ; yet the common man the somewhat more than nine-tenths of the population is doubt - less worse off in point of hard usage and privation in
Japan	LOCATION	than in
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		In further illustration of this doubt and per - plexity with regard to the material value of national self-determination , the case of the three Scandinavian countries may be worth citing .

		They are all and several self-determining nations , in that Pickwickian sense in which any country which is not a Great Power may be self-determining in the twentieth cen - tury .

		But they differ in size , population , wealth , power , and political consequence .

		In these respects the sequence runs :
Sweden	LOCATION	,
Denmark	LOCATION	,
Norway	LOCATION	, the latter being the smallest , poorest , least self-determin - ing , and altogether the most spectacularly foolish of the lot .

		But so far as concerns the material con - ditions of life for the common man , they are un - mistakably the most favorable , or the most nearly tolerable , in
Norway	LOCATION	, and the least so in
Sweden	LOCATION	.

		The upshot of evidence from these , and from other instances that might be cited , is to leave the point
1919	DATE	THE DIAL in doubt .

		It is not evident that the common man has anything to gain by national self-determination , so far as regards his material conditions of life ; nor does it appear , on the evidence of these instances , that he has much to lose by that means .

		These Scandinavians differ from the Balkan states in that they perforce have no imperialistic ambitions .

		There may of course be a question on this head so far as concerns the frame of mind of the royal establishment in the greater one of the Scandinavian kingdoms ; there is not much that is worth saying about that matter , and the less that is said , the less annoyance .

		It is a matter of no sig - nificance , anyway .

		The Scandinavians are in effect not imperialistic , perforce .

		Which means that in their international relations they formally adhere to the rule of Live and Let Live .

		Not so in their domestic policy , however .

		They have all endowed themselves with all the encumbrances of national pretensions and discrimination which their circum - stances will admit .

		Apart from a court and church which foot up to nothing more comfortable than a gratuitious bill of expense , they are also content to carry the burden of a national armament , a pro- tective tariff , a national consular service , and a diplomatic service which takes care of a moderately burdensome series of treaty agreements governing the trade relations of Scandinavian business com - munity all designed for the benefit of the vested interests and the kept classes , and all at the cost of the common man .

		The case of these relatively free , relatively un - assuming , and relatively equitable national estab - lishments is also instructive .

		They come as near the rule of Live and Let Live as any national establish - ment well can and still remain a national estab - lishment actuated by notions of competitive self-help .

		But all the while the national administration runs along , with nothing better to show to any impartial scrutiny than a considerable fiscal burden and a moderate volume of hindrance to the country 's in - dustry , together with some incidental benefit to the vested interests and the kept classes at the cost of the underlying community .

		These Scandinavians oc - cupy a peculiar position in the industrial world .

		They are each and several too small to make up anything like a self-contained industrial community , even under the most unreserved pressure of national exclusiveness .

		Their industries necessarily are part and parcel of the industrial system at large , with which they are bound in relations of give and take at every point .

		Yet they are content to carry a customs tariff of fairly grotesque dimensions and a national consular service of more grotesque dimen - sions still .

		This situation is heightened by their relatively sterile soil , their somewhat special and narrow range of natural resources , and their high latitude , which precludes any home growth of many of the indispensable materials of industry under the new order .

		Yet they are content to carry their customs tariff , their special commercial treaties , and their consular service for the benefit of their vested interests .

		It should seem that this elaborate superfluity of national outlay and obstruction should work great hardship to the underlying community whose in - dustry is called on to carry this burden of lag , leak , and friction .

		And doubtless the burden is suffici - ently real .

		It amounts of course to the nation 's working at cross-purposes with itself , for the benefit of those special interests that stand to gain a little something by it all .

		But in this as in other works of sabotage there are compensating effects , and these should not be overlooked ; particularly since the case is fairly typical of what commonly happens .

		The waste and sabotage of the national establishment and its obstructive policy works no intolerable hardship , because it all runs its course and eats its fill within that margin of sabotage and wasteful consumption that would have to be taken care of by some other agency in the absence of this one .

		That is to say , something like the same volume of sabotage and waste is indispensable to the prosperity ` of business under the conditions of the new order , so long as business and industry are managed under the con - ditions imposed by the price system .

		By one means or another prices must be maintained at a profitable level ; therefore the output must be restricted to a reasonable rate and volume , and wasteful consump - tion must be provided for on pain of a failing mar - ket .

		And all this may as well be taken care of by use of a princely court , an otiose church , a picturesque army , a well-fed diplomatic and consular service , and a customs frontier .

		In the absence of all this national apparatus of sabotage substantially the same results would have to be got at by the less seemly means of a furtive conspiracy in restraint of trade among the vested interests .

		There is always some - thing to be said for the national integrity .

		The case of these Scandinavian nations , taken in connection and comparison with what is to be seen elsewhere , appears to say that a national establish - ment which has no pretensions to power and no im - perialistic ambitions is preferable , in point of ' econ - omy and peaceable behavior , to an establishment which carries these attributes of self-determination and self-help .

		The more nearly the national in - tegrity and self-determination approaches to make - believe the less mischief is it likely to work at home < and the more nearly will it be compatible with the THE DIAL
January	DATE	n rule of Live and Let Live in dealing with its neighbors .

		And the further implication is plain without argument , that the most beneficent change that can conceivably overtake any national establish - ment would be to let it fall into `` innocuous desuetude . ''

		Apparently , the less the better , with no apparent limit short of the vanishing point .

		Such appears to be the object-lesson enforced by recent and current events , in so far as concerns the material fortunes of the underlying community at large as well as the keeping of the peace .

		But it does not therefore follow that all men and classes will have the same interest in so neutralizing the nation 's powers and disallowing the national pre - tensions .

		The existing nations are not of a homo - geneous make-up within themselves perhaps less so in proportion as they have progressively come under the rule of the new order in industry and in busi - ness .

		There is an increasingly evident cleavage of interest between industry and business , or between production and ownership , or between tangible per - formance and free income one phrase may serve as well as another , and neither is quite satisfactory to mark the contrast of interest between the common man on the one hand and the vested interests and kept classes on the other hand .

		But it should be sufficiently plain that the national establishment and its control of affairs has a value for the vested in - terests different from what it has for the underlying community .

		Quite plainly , the new order in industry has no use or place for national discrimination or national pretensions of any kind ; and quite plainly such a phrase as `` national integrity '' has no shadow of .

		meaning for this new industrial order which over - runs national frontiers and overcomes national dis - crimination as best it can , in all directions and all the time .

		For industry as carried on under the new order , the overcoming of national discrimination is part of the ordinary day 's work .

		But it is otherwise with the new order of business enterprise large - scale , corporate , resting on intangible assets , and turning on free income which flows from managerial sabotage ; The business community has urgent need of an efficient national establishment both at home and abroad .

		A settled government , duly equipped with national pretensions , and with legal and mili - tary power to maintain the sacredness of contracts at home and to enforce the claims of its business men aboard such an establishment is invaluable for the conduct of business , though its industrial value may not unusually be less than nothing .

		Industry is a matter of tangible performance in the way of producing goods and services .

		And in this connection it is well to recall that a vested in - terest is a prescriptive right to get something for nothing .

		Now any project of reconstruction the scope and method of which are governed by consid - erations of tangible performance is likely to allow only a subsidiary consideration or something less to the legitimate claims of the vested interests , whether they are vested interests of business or of privilege .

		It is more than probable that in such a case national pretensions in the way of preferential concessions in commerce and investment will be allowed to fall into neglect , so far as to lose all value to any vested in - terest whose fortunes they touch .

		These things have no effect in the way of net tangible performance .

		They only afford ground for preferential pecuniary rights , always at the cost of someone else ; but they are of the essence of things in that pecuniary order within which the vested interests of business live and move .

		So also such a matter-of-fact project of reconstruction will be likely materially to revise out - standing credit obligations , including corporation securities , or perhaps even to disallow claims of this character to free income on the part of beneficiaries who can show no claim on grounds of current tangi - ble performance .

		All of which is inimical to the best good of the vested interests and the kept classes .

		Reconstruction which partakes of this character in any sensible degree will necessarily be viewed with the liveliest apprehension by the gentlemanly states - men of the old school , by the kept classes , and by the captains of finance .

		It will be deplored as a sub - version of the economic order , a destruction of the country 's wealth , a disorganization of industry , and a sure way to poverty , bloodshed , and pestilence .

		In point of fact , of course , what such a project may be counted on to subvert is the dominion of ownership by which the vested interests control and retard the rate and volume of production .

		The destruction of wealth in such a case will touch , directly , only the value of the securities , not the material objects to which these securities have given title of ownership ; it would be a disallowance of ownership , not a de - struction of useful goods .

		Nor need any disorgani - zation or disability of productive industry follow from such - a move ; indeed , the apprehended cancel - ment of the claims to income covered by negotiable securities would by that much cancel the fixed over - head charges resting on industrial enterprise , and so further production by that much .

		But for those persons and classes whose keep is drawn from pre - scriptive rights of ownership or of privilege the con - sequences of such a shifting of ground from vested interest to tangible performance would doubtless be deplorable .

		In short , `` Bolshevism is a menace '' ; and the wayfaring man is likely to ask : A menace to whom ?

VEBLEN	PERSON	.

		1919 THE DIAL The New Work of Puccini 1 ROBABLY the most interesting musical event of the year was the world premiere of Puccini ` si three one - act operas at the
Metropolitan Opera House	ORGANIZATION	in
New York	LOCATION
December 14 , 1918	DATE	.

		During eight years we have been waiting for new work from
Puccini	ORGANIZATION	, for since The Girl of the
Golden West	LOCATION	he has pro- duced only La Rondine -LRB-
Monte Carlo	ORGANIZATION	,
April 1917	DATE	-RRB- , which is equally uninteresting in words and music .

		Puccini is the most popular living composer for the stage ; and he deserves his place .

		He has always remained himself , yet he has always felt the wider movements of musical development .

		He is never a pioneer , but he always profits by the advanced idioms .

		Nor is he ever the last to lay the old aside .

		He has kept to the middle path .

		A bigger reason yet is that he never forgets that an opera should be an evening 's entertainment .

		Therefore he wisely goes to dramatists for librettos .


Edgar	PERSON	was a revision of Musset 's La Coupe et les Levres ;
Manon Lescaut	PERSON	had already been success - fully treated as an opera by
Massenet ; Tosca	ORGANIZATION	was by
Sardou	ORGANIZATION	,
Madame Butterfly	ORGANIZATION	by Long and
Belasco	PERSON	, and The Girl of the Golden West by
Belasco	ORGANIZATION	.

		He established his own theory of opera -LRB- or `` musical drama , '' as he prefers to call it -RRB- long before
Caval	PERSON	- leria Rusticana and I Pagliacci popularized it .

		He avoids the choppy effect of the old recitative-aria - scena style ; he also escapes the monotony of Teu - tonic leit-motif elaborations .

		Instead
Puccini	PERSON	has solved the problem by combining the aria with the never-ending melody .

		His drama flows unin - terrupted , but the higher moments are formalized into conventional melodies .

		Thus he adapts the W'agnerian method to the spirit of Bizet , sacrificing neither action nor song .

		Nor is this so much theory as instinct , for
Puccini	ORGANIZATION	actually possesses that rare combination , the lyric plus the dramatic sense .

		He can write tunes that everybody likes to hum and he can make a climax all the more exciting by his orchestral accompani - ment .

		Moreover he is a great scene painter .

		The exterior of the Cafe Momus in
La Boheme	LOCATION	, the slow snow of the opening of the third act , Madame But - terfly 's ascent of the hill , the flight of her relatives in the twilight ,
Johnson	PERSON	and
Minnie	PERSON	's departure through the great cedars , the homesick minstrel in the saloon : all these and more are to be remembered musically .

		His new works sustain his reputation , though they may not add to it .

		They are three : a. tragedy , a romance , and a comedy , all centered about death .

		The first , II Tabarro , is the most sophisticated , the most ambitious .

		Puccini has been working on it for some time .

		There were rumors of it as far back as
1914	DATE	, and the play from which it is built -LRB- Didier Gold 's La Houppelande -RRB- was performed in
Paris	LOCATION	about
1910	DATE	.

		The story is simple the aging hus - band kills the lover .

		The scene is strikingly set upon a barge on the
Seine	LOCATION	in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Of course the people are not French : neither is Minnie American , nor Madame Butterfly Japanese .

		The music is thoroughly interesting :
Puccini	PERSON	has made a number of harmonic experiments , and has succeeded with them ; and the orchestration is sensitive and daring .

		Melodically , however , the opera is not so successful , for the composer has yet to learn that exotic har - monies will not enrich a cheap tune .

		-LRB- I am not referring , it will be understood , to tunes whose color is intentionally that of the streets . -RRB-

		Especially bad in this respect is the climax of a duet to
Paris	LOCATION	, Ma chi Ifiscia il sobborgo , made still more irritating by the succeeding pause for applause .

		The employ - ment of the hand-organ is amusing and clever , and compares favorably with
Strawinsky	PERSON	's use of it in
Petrushka	LOCATION	; and after the exit of
Talpa	LOCATION	and Frugola there is excellent suspense , but it is sustained too long , and the husband 's extended aria to the river is bad dramatically and not quite successful musically .

		The final curtain , however the husband madly flinging his wife at her lover 's corpse is unfor - gettable .

		Suor
Angelica	PERSON	, the second of the trio , is , I feel , a distinct failure .

		The music is far too unsophisti - cated to be natural ; there is too much repetition of phrases ; v and the climaxes are not adequate .

		As for the libretto , the plot does not seem very natural ; the action is padded with irrelevant semi-episodes ; and the end is operatic in the worst sense .

		In II
Tabarro Puccini	PERSON	made the modern mistake of elim - inating all sympathy for the characters ; in Suor Angelica he goes to the ` other extreme of too much sentimentalizing .

		The story is that of a daughter of a patrician family who fell and was forced to enter a convent .

		Seven years later she hears of the death of her son , takes poison , and is rewarded with a vision of the Virgin .

		The effect of the white robes of the nuns floating about in the garden is pretty ; but only the excitement of the evening and the per - sonality of
Farrar	PERSON	made the performance a success .


Gianni Schicchi	PERSON	, however , more than redeemed it .

		As an entertainment this piece is by far the most successful of the three .

		It is a story out of the In - ferno , retold in the spirit of
Boccaccio	LOCATION	.

		Gianni is of essentially the same stock as Buffulmacchio .

		A ras - 26 THE DIAL
January	DATE	n cally lawyer , he is called in to break the will of a rich Florentine merchant , for the relatives have dis - covered that most of the property has been left to the
Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is only one way to do it : they bundle the corpse out ;
Gianni	ORGANIZATION	takes the dead man 's place -LRB- his death has not yet been made public -RRB- ; the notary is called in ; and a new will is dictated .

		Gianni gives each of the relatives a generous in - heritance ; but the richest of all he calmly leaves to himself , knowing that the relatives dare not inter - fere .

		As soon as the notary is gone , they set upon him ; but he arms himself with a stick and drives them all out of the palace his palace now !

		The music throughout is carefully subordinated to the action , as it should be , though without losing its own interest .

		It is fairly modern , yet unaffected ; and it is packed with color and vitality .

		A chorus of `` poisoned laughter '' is especially good .

		Yet there are weak spots notably
Lauretta	PERSON	's sweet little song , O mio babbino , which is as cheap a song as
Puccini	ORGANIZATION	has ever written , and which was duly encored .

		An enjoyable evening , if not epoch-making .

		Puc - cini has reached his maturity : his orchestration is perfected , his harmonies nearly so , though his melo - dies have not kept pace .

		The influences of other composers are less noticeable ;
Puccini	ORGANIZATION	is more than ever himself .

		The greatest faults were perhaps the moments of unsustained suspense , the occasional cheap tunes , and the set places for applause .

		A pos - sible effect of the evening may well be the establish - ment of the trilogy of one-act operas , which would be a fashion both fresh and satisfactory .

		As we have moved from the epic through the novel to the short story , so we may come to prefer three brief musical tales to the older , ponderous forms .

		More is to be expected from
Puccini	LOCATION	, for there have been rumors of other one-act operas :
Anima Allegri	PERSON	, from
Guntero	PERSON	's comedy of the same name ; I Due Zoccoletti from
Ouida	LOCATION	's Two Little Wooden Shoes ; and a third , a farce about a party of
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- peans captured by cannibals .

		These cannibals had once been captured by Europeans and made to build a model village at a World 's Fair ; so they now re - tort in kind upon the Europeans .

		There may be still other operas in store for us : II Tabarro and
Gianni Schicchi	ORGANIZATION	must make us hope there are .

		S. FOSTER DAMON .

		A Typically American Personality IHESE UNITED STATES have not lacked powerful and picturesque leaders among their governors .

		But sometimes they fail to write their autobiog - raphies , and sometimes they become senators or presi - dents ; and the strength and individuality of the provincial ruler , dowered with the strength and indi - viduality of his own province , becomes a fading tradition or is merged with national qualities , inter - ests , and events .

		In The Autobiography of a
Penn	LOCATION	- sylvanian -LRB-
John C. Winston	ORGANIZATION	;
Philadelphia	LOCATION	;
$ 3	MONEY	-RRB- Governor
Pennypacker	PERSON	has recorded himself `` un - altered , unexpurgated , and unedited '' by his execu - tors , according to the published request of distin - guished friends , who knowing The whims are many Of Governor Penny
Pennypacker	PERSON	of
Penn	LOCATION	doubtless conjectured a manuscript disconcerting in its honesty , keenness , and mirth .

		And he has re - corded himself as a Pennsylvanian to whom his state , with a vaster population than the
England of Elizabeth	ORGANIZATION	, and with traditions of indisputable leadership in American ideas and ideals , was the greatest of our commonwealths .

		There is something vital for
America	LOCATION	in this note something that , in these days when the federal idea is all in all -LRB- except as it too is merging into some - thing still more big as a world-idea -RRB- , calls us back to the constitutional and ethnic structure of our country and the personality , dignity , and dy - namics of its individual parts .

		Though so vigorous and old-fashioned a lover of the Union that to him the Civil War was still `` the War of the Rebellion , '' and the recent statue to Lee a blasphemy , as Gov - ernor ,
Pennypacker	PERSON	would brook no interference from
Washington	LOCATION	in the settlement of domestic coal - strikes ; and , as scholar , he devoted himself exclu - sively to the history of his state , taking now and then a fall out of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	-LRB- and her expatriated son , `` the discoverer of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, '' whom he calls `` a job printer '' on the evidence of some two hun - dred and odd chiefly mercantile publications of
Franklin	PERSON	's press in his own private library -RRB- .

		One feels the Pennsylvanian not alone in the
Pennsyl	LOCATION	- vanian subject matter ; quite as much in the essen - tially Pennsylvanian -LRB- sometimes Philadelphian ! -RRB-

		gestures , tones , outlook .

		There is the state manner , very different from the state manner of a Virginian aristocrat or of a
Bay State Brahmin	ORGANIZATION	or even of a
Wisconsin	LOCATION	Progressive .

		In spite of its glorious pro- vincialism ,
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	has a rugged cosmopolitan ancestry the Dutch , the Germans , the Swedes , the English , the Scotch , the Irish ; Church of
England	LOCATION	,
Mennonite	LOCATION	,
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	; Liberty Bell and
Gettysburg	LOCATION	1919 THE DIAL 2 7 have all contributed to the Pennsylvanian `` manner , '' even as they nearly all contributed to the physical or mental antecedents of
Pennypacker	PERSON	himself .

		But it is for
Pennypacker	PERSON	, after all , rather than for his state , that his book has enduring pith .

		For
Pennypacker	PERSON	, too , rather than for politics .

		That request of those distinguished friends who wanted him `` unexpurgated '' emphasizes the manuscript as `` an invaluable historical document . ''

		There are new and kindlier lights on Quay , who assisted , with - out ever controlling , his grateful but independent contemporary ; there is some inside history of old political campaigns -LRB- federal , state , city -RRB- ; there are Civil War reminiscences ; there is a full account of his triumphant governorship , `` four years filled with storms from start to finish '' ; and there is a wel - come plenty of ruthlessly keen and honest comment on the character and conduct of the great and the near-great , living and dead .

		Yet his public life was focal to no great crisis , stood for no great epoch , was identified with no great movement , state or federal ; and thus the record can not have the larger historical significance of the autobiography of , say ,
Carl Schurz	PERSON	or of
Grant	LOCATION	, or perhaps of LaFollette .

		But a man 's a man for a ' that , and may turn up sturdy , wise , human without making great history or being made great by history .

		Any - one who reads this autobiography will meet therein somebody who will make a difference for him : that is its ultimate significance .


Charles Francis Adams	PERSON	sets down near the begin - ning of his autobiography -LRB- which by the way was one of the last books the Pennsylvanian records as read , in the notebook he always kept at his elbow -RRB- : `` I now humbly thank fortune that I have almost got through life without making a conspicuous ass of myself . ''

		This may be the
Boston	LOCATION	understatement , the indifferentism of one born to a name and a tradition supposedly so secure that self-depreciation is simply good form is one 's set and an
Adams	PERSON	or a
Lowell	LOCATION	in
Boston	LOCATION	still talks , I think , mostly to his set .

		But nothing like this for
Samuel Whitaker Pennypacker	PERSON	!

		He has had a ripping time being done to : from the days when he had colic as a country baby to the days when , as Governor , his tousled head was cartooned by the press of the nation .

		He has had an even more ripping time doing to : as judge , giving a chap eight months for cutting off a dog 's tail , and performing other stunts based on opinions unusual in the derivative and artificial code of the sober judiciary ; as bibliophile , going incog up into the country and buying job lots of queer old books at German farmhouse auctions ; as antiquarian and scholar , discovering dates and authors , corresponding with or interviewing schol - ars abroad , editing law cases or old documents , writing innumerable books and pamphlets , and read - ing eight or so languages -LRB- mostly self-taught -RRB- ; as politician , standing up for
Blaine	LOCATION	; as banqueter -LRB- and the
City of Brotherly Love	ORGANIZATION	has always been much given to these social affairs -RRB- saying with gusto the thing he was supposed not to say , and taking home the menus to be preserved and bound ; as candidate , electioneering thus-wise : `` I do n't know whether I will make a good governor or not you will have to run the risk and take the responsibility '' ; as gov - ernor , collecting bugs in
Wetzel Swamp	ORGANIZATION	or `` crush - ing the freedom of the press '' its freedom to pub - lish filth , libel , and lies unpunished and answering unperturbed the reporter 's query , `` Does not this continuel objurgation -LSB- the press attacks -RSB- disturb you ? ''

		by taking his cue from a momentary rumb - bling in the western sky : `` I have often sat upon this porch when the clouds gathered out yonder , and presently the lightnings flashed and the thunders rattled until in the uproar my voice could not be heard .

		Where those storms have gone no man knows , and here I am sitting on this porch still . ''

		He has lived with zest interested in all sorts of things , but chiefly in
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	and in human nature ; he has got some things done that seemed to him -LRB- and to
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	and to the rest of us -RRB- worth doing .

		And in this , the summing up , he is living the whole business over with zest too .

		But the effect is as far from braggadocio as from under - statement : such a combination of rollicking and in - genuous frankness and self-satisfaction , with philo - sophical sagacity and the critical spirit -LRB- toward his own life and character as well as toward all else -RRB- , , is not often found .

		On the other hand , if this vigorous , reflective , forthright , eccentric , and withal kindly man ever knew the agonies of pain , sickness , and death , ever brooded in any suffering of the spirit , ever was lifted by great music or great love oj any other of the spiritually expanding instrumentalities of human life , he has left us here no record .

		Nor is there but a word here and there about his own fireside .

		It is not a book about the soul or the home : it is a book about a man busy in the everyday world , who sees through make-believe , helps good things along , col - lects all sorts of souvenirs , remembers everybody 's full name , knows everybody 's genealogy , and creates unconsciously through three score years and ten , out of himself and out of his neighborhood , a typi - cally American personality which is a good whole - some sort of thing , though its typical limitations in subtility , inwardness , imagination , sense of propor - tion , and mellow taste should not be forgotten .

		28 THE DIAL
January 11	DATE	Eugenics Made in
Germany	LOCATION	A HERE ARE two logics a logic of passion and a logic of fact .

		The latter accumulates its material , classifies it according to its nature , allows it to assume the pattern inevitable to that nature , and calls the pattern the law which governs the ma - terial ; the law emerges from the facts , not the facts from the law .

		Quite contrary is the procedure of the logic of passion .

		It begins as an impulse , a prejudice , an appetite , a wish , conscious perhaps , more often unconscious , always starved , voracious , and ashamed of the candor and frankness of day , always seeking disguise and justification , and always , consequently , sucking into its vortex all sorts of materials , relevant and irrelevant , important and worthless , that will give it aid and comfort and right , that will make it seem reasonable .

		The pattern into which materials so gathered fall is not the effect of their essential nature , not the revelation of their underlying unity , not a natural pattern .

		The pattern into which materials so gathered fall is an artificial pattern ; its unity is the unity of the passion or prejudice that holds them together , and when it lapses , they scatter .

		The differentia of such a pattern are easily observable : its elements are incongruous with one another ; the bulk of them are assumptions , dogmas , speculations , conjectures , pre - sented as facts because they sustain the passion which holds them together .

		Whatever correct material is mixed with them they distort and diminish in value .

		The logic of Mr.
Seth K. Humphreys	PERSON	in Man - kind : Racial Values and the Racial Prospect -LRB- Scribner ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- is the logic of passion .

		Indeed this book of Mr.
Humphreys	PERSON	' needs only an intro - duction by a professional patriot to make it a perfect thing of its kind .

		It has the hortatory unction , the smattering of sciences , the dogmatism , and the pretentiousness which the protagonists of American Junkerism have standardized for the read - ing public .

		Its style is perhaps too fine , too re - strained .

		But that is an incident .

		The play 's the thing , and the play was made in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		In that land of passionate self-appreciation there was invented a tall , strong , blond , brainy being , every inch a German , who was described as coming out of the North , and creating all over
Europe	LOCATION	and
Asia	LOCATION	from
Japan	LOCATION	to
Italy	LOCATION	any particular item of civiliza - tion that the Germans liked .

		They called this blond aborigine `` Aryan . ''

		Because they fancied they liked Christianity they declared that Jesus was an Aryan .

		Because they fancied they liked Japanese prints , they declared that the Aryan blood in the Japanese made them .

		And so on .

		So on , against the total absence of anthropological and archeological evidence ; so on , against the incontrovertible witness of anthropology and archeology that the basic advances of civilization are due to the Alpine and
Mediterranean	LOCATION	types in the
Orient	LOCATION	,
Greece	LOCATION	, and
Italy	LOCATION	; that the geographical distribution of ethnic types crosses the lines of na - tional boundaries ; that it is absurd , consequently , to identify race , type , and nation .

		But the evidence of science matters as little to Mr.
Humphreys	PERSON	as to that renegade Englishman ,
Houston Stewart Chamberlain	PERSON	, and the rest of the Pan-Germanist priesthood .

		He presents this myth - ological fancy as fact , without authority and without argument , and upon it he bases his `` racial prospect . ''


France	LOCATION	is racially exhausted ;
England	LOCATION	is distinctly on the way to exhaustion ; whatever contribution to civilization came from
Russia	LOCATION	was made by Teutons ; the Germans alone , being a young race , and a pure race , and a good race , and Aryan oh so Aryan !

		have the future in their hands .

		Against them there are however the renewed Anglo-Saxon stocks of the Anzac lands , and of
America	LOCATION	.

		But
America	LOCATION	gives Mr.
Humphreys	PERSON	pause
America	LOCATION	, the melting-pot , is a mongrel farm , and the mixing of the inferior races from
Central	ORGANIZATION	and
Southern Europe	LOCATION	, of the in - digenous Indian and imported African with the su - perior Anglo-Saxon means degeneration .

		Of course African and Indian sometimes do things Aryans might be proud of , but those things are to be attributed to Aryan blood !

		Thus Mr.
Seth Humphreys	PERSON	, concerning the value and future of mankind , oblivious or ignorant of the sober finding of anthropology and archeology ; oblivious or ignorant , or wilfully ignoring , the social and economic history of the nations of whose future he so glibly and cathedrally disposes , particularly of
Germany	LOCATION	's , the factors in whose `` spectacular rise '' are very far from being even fifty per cent Aryan .

		He has uttered a passion , not recorded a perception .

		The pity of his utterance lies in the perversion it operates on certain eugenic considerations of great importance , and altogether independent of the myth - ology with which it is applied .

		That the superior are for a variety of reasons infertile , that the multiplica - tion of the inferior is excessive , that the war has produced an inevitable disproportion of females to males , in which the breeding of the superior is placed at a still greater disadvantage , are all matters de - serving the deepest attention of the classes concerned with the conservation of the race , in whatever na - tion .

		That the principle which must govern the
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 29 use of any chosen remedy in this situation must in - volve an enhanced reproduction of the eugenically fit and a greatly diminished reproduction of the eugenically unfit can not be too much stressed .

		And it is true also that such a principle must needs gen - erate very definite changes in the conventions of sex .

		But why blur and depreciate important concep - tions of this sort with racial mythology ?

		The answer is that in the logic of the passions reality is made to minister to fancy in the hope that it may impart some of its solidity to the object of desire .

		The process is technically called `` rationalization . ''

		Mr.
Humphreys	PERSON	' book is a more tactful attempt than Mr.
Madison Grant	PERSON	's to `` rationalize '' war -
H. M. KALLEN	PERSON	.


Kreymborg	PERSON	's Marionettes W HITMAN AND not
Poe	PERSON	was the true pioneer of American poetry .

		Poe filled narrow unpliant forms with a wild , fantastic , supple life .

		He played freely within circumscribed boundaries , because boundaries did not constrict him he was the kind of bird that sings most sweetly in a cage .

		But
Whitman	PERSON	's was a grandly nihilistic gesture .

		He assailed the whole bastille of form and brought it tumbling about his own ears .

		He was a liberator of rhythms as
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	was of ethics .

		And at that he achieved no modern miracle .

		His was the world - old revolt of life , weary of constraining her mighty rhythms in `` piano tunes . ''

		Wholly a democrat , he was concerned only with the broad and common currents of existence whatever surrounded and in - cluded the life of crowds and like most democrats he was unaware of nuances .

		But in a literary sense his service to .

		America equaled that of
Washington	LOCATION	and the co-Fathers of the Revolution .

		Like theirs , his Declaration of Independence sounded `` a bar - baric yawp over the roofs of the world . ''

		And though we may smile tolerantly at the clumsy ways of a pioneer and clear away his good rank grasses , it is over his unrailed clearing rather than along the slender trail of
Poe	PERSON	that the truly American poets will pass to their own .

		He has made it easier for men so unlike as
Frost	ORGANIZATION	and
Sandburg	PERSON	and Bodenheim and Masters to grow and push out horizons .

		Even Vachel Lindsay would not have had space enough for his adorable ragtime , if Whitman 's breath had not blown over the stucco palaces and rose gardens and high English hedges , and left a great clear space like a prairie for free rhythms to gallop in .

		But of all the poets that are now travailing out of this large incoherence that is
America	LOCATION	,
Kreymborg	PERSON	is most strangely and poignantly alone .

		Whether , like some elfin Hamlet , folded in an ironic smile as in a cloak , or gazing out of his own Mushrooms , solemn-eyed , gnomelike , with naively interested eyes on an unrelated world , he seems to have no artistic roots .

		This is apparent even in Mushrooms , for never since the great Walt scattered his Leaves over an offended continent has there been a poetic firstling that has shown so few `` influences . ''

		Its method , then tentative , uncertain , seemed a seed blown from nowhere .

		Now we feel its upward growth in these Plays for Poem-Mimes , in which common words made taut like strings seem to have acquired a new and silvery timbre .

		Kreymborg seems * to melt life as in a crucible and pour it into these quaintly human marionettes from whom it perpetually brims over .

		Except for
Mani	ORGANIZATION	- kin and
Minikin	PERSON	who probably flouted their be - getter 's plan by announcing themselves as fujl-blown egos one can imagine these little dramas being staged in souls and played by `` the people who live in people , '' so eerily intimate are they .

		All six plays have a musical structure .

		Deftly , surely , with his sensitive musician 's fingers ,
Kreynv	PERSON	borg touches those tenuous quivering threads that radiate beneath the compact surface of life .

		First he makes a silence a silence of wheels and cranes and a silence of subways and barrel organs even a silence of feet stamping upon gallery floors .

		And you who would watch his swaying motifs in their rhythmic dances and listen to their subtile music , must pass through this luminous silence that sur - rounds them like an aura .

		But if you would enjoy the full luster of each silvery dissonance you must hush those too clamorous memories of Broadway and the blind white scream of spotlights .

		For
Kreymborg	PERSON	sweeps away all ready-made gestures and all unnecessary noises .

		He deals direct with life , and life needs silence to be heard .

		When the curtain rises on Manikin and
Minikin	PERSON	: A Bisque-Play , we see only a mantel shelf and a huge clock ticking away eternity between `` two aris - tocratic bisque figures , a boy in cerise and a girl in cornflower blue . ''

		The servant girl , whom we never see but of whose nearness we are always aware , has 3 THE DIAL
January 1 1	DATE	turned them away from each other so that they see only the everlasting armchair , the everlasting tiger skin , the everlasting yellow , green and purple books .

		And into these two inanimates , who recall their childhood in the English museum ,
Kreymborg	PERSON	has poured a full , sweet tide of life .

		We do not think of them as puppets but as living essences gestures cf surrounded beauty , captured like two bright birds and held static in time .

		Minikin asking : Who made me what I am who dreamed me in motionless clay ?

		or voicing her jealousy of the servant
Minikin	PERSON	who does not know how old she is is as perfect of her kind as any of the great characters of literature .

		Manikin says in his sad wise philosophy : The life of an animate is a procession of deaths with but a secret sorrowing candle guttering lower and lower on the path to the grave the life of an inanimate is as serenely enduring as all still things are .

		And I feel this little play to be of such stuff as will prove to be `` serenely enduring . ''

		Unlike some of
Kreymborg	PERSON	's other work , it has no loose repeti - tions straying like uncared-for children , and no frayed ends ; the whole is correlated into a perfect form .

		A lesser artist might have made a catastrophic finale by letting the servant girl `` shatter the great happy centuries ahead '' by sweeping
Minikin	PERSON	from `` the everlasting shelf . ''

		As it is , the play leaves off on the progressive chord .

		Only the mellow chimes of the clock striking the hour round the silence like the last touch on a jewel .

		Of the comedies ,
Lima	LOCATION	Beans : A Scherzo-Play , with a dainty allegro movement , is a prolonged rip - ple of quaintly satirical laughter in which
Kreym	PERSON	- borg , delicately whimsically as some supernaturally wise gnome , mocks at life with her own symbols .

		Jack 's
House	ORGANIZATION	: A Cubic-Play is not so easily disposed of .

		It has a way of leaving one 's concep - tion of it swinging foolishly like an empty cage .

		At first one follows pleasantly the miming of its two figures and smiles at
Jack	PERSON	's expectations of his doll - wife , who is hardly more than a delicious pout and what has a pout to do with home-making ?

		Later this little oblique satire on the American home acts as an emotional irritant .

		There is something vaguely chilling about an atmosphere where two black pillows on our green couch are the make-believe children .

		Besides , the poet 's thought has a trick of whisking into ambush and out again , - tagging and dancing away , making impish mouths .

		One leaves it with a sense of futility and of being wounded uselessly and of feeling bits of severed life fumbling for each other .

		And yet , for those of us who have seen
Jack	PERSON	's
House	ORGANIZATION	produced by the Other Players and listened to the wistfully importunate accompaniment of
Julian Freedman	PERSON	's music , this parody of a home will rock in our memory no matter what we grow to .

		In Blue and Green : A Shadow-Play love avid , morbidly aware , eternally touching and swaying apart is again the dominant motif .

		The two fig - ures , talking in silvery monotones while `` fragments of their lives dance a shadow-dance '' against a blue
California	LOCATION	sky , compare their dissonances with an exquisite and intimate clarity , flowing through each other 's consciousness like two streams of faintly iridescent water .

		If a man and woman could so commune through their mortal opacity , then these two might be any man and any woman who had tried to mold the other to his own image , only to find the image mean , commonplace , bitterly familiar a sight to be effaced with the first recognition .

		This thought of our multiple spiritual recreations of each other finds constant expression in
Kreym	LOCATION	- borg 's work .

		The old figure in When the
Willow Nods	ORGANIZATION	says of the Girl : Your least sly look recreates folk to your image ; and it is the main theme of People Who Die .

		In this lonely Dream-Play , Love has almost ceased to importune her dead children .

		And the two figures are as shells that `` we hold to our ear '' and through which we hear the roaring backwash of life .

		It seems in a sense to be a sequel to Blue and
Green	ORGANIZATION	, penetrating even deeper than the latter into inner sacristies .

		As dramatic structures these two plays are the weakest in the group .

		Perhaps they are spiritual records done at a too close perspective to be expressed in conscious terms of art .

		But in order to assume any dramatic or even any permanent literary value they would have to be recast and all those groping segments constrained into some definite form .

		As it is , they are as good wine that has been spilled on the ground instead of poured into clear-cut goblets .

		The book is at once a challenge and a stimu - lus .

		It reminds us that the artist 's interpre - tation of life must be more than a record of action or a corroboration of registered emotions .

		Kipling achieved these brilliantly and reached his period be - fore thirty .

		Our individual reactions to the tangible beat in ever dwindling vibrations the exploration
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 3 1 of the intangible is the one inexhaustible adventure .

		Blows , gifts , kisses , wine , stars , winds , sun the time comes to every artist when he has answered even these , and when the raised and visible signs by which our mute souls quibble to each other need to be re-energized by the impetus of some new discov - ery .

		And it is this spirit of discovery this getting out and making a clearing , instead of huddling in mental tenements that is
Kreymborg	PERSON	's great signifi - cance .

		In one almost painfully clutching gesture that of musically monotonous repetitions he resembles
Maeterlinck	PERSON	.

		But he has none of the great Bel - gian 's fear of personal extinction .

		His spiritual at - titude is serenely robust , and his regret is never foi People Who Die , but for `` the people who die ir people , '' those fragile and lovely images the eg -LRB- fashions of its beloved .

		Whether we like him or not , it will soon bi obligatory to recognize
Kreymborg	PERSON	as an impelling force in the new American drama .

		In discardinj old forms he has merely thrown away what to hin are worn-out swaddlings no longer whole enough o : spacious enough to contain the living , growing es sence .

		His aim is to make life face itself anew b -RSB- the aid of new symbols life , never to be persuadec or reconciled by its own `` bitterly familiar '' image LOLA RIDGE .

		Imagination and Vision IT is SOME years now since `` JE '' published a book of the nature of this
Candle of Vision	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- Mac - millan ;
London	LOCATION	-RRB- , which breaks the line of political writings that have given Mr.
George W. Russell	PERSON	a public unknown to the earlier `` IE '' Indeed , only the readers of esoteric magazines and the hoarders of rare pamphlets will easily recall the last prose publication of '' / E 's , '' to which the present volume attaches itself in the lineage of his work .

		There were chapters in Imaginations and Reveries -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	;
1915	DATE	-RRB- to remind us that `` JE , '' the mystic , was not completely submerged in Mr.
George Russell	PERSON	, the cooperator and economist .

		That book , consisting for the most part of reprinted early essays , may serve as a bridge between the poet of Homeward -LRB- 1894 -RRB- and The Earth Breath -LRB- 1897 -RRB- and the prose author of
The Candle of Vision	ORGANIZATION	, for here he has returned to analyze and to expound the experiences and teaching of his verse .

		These medi - tations are `` the efforts of an artist and poet to relate his own vision to the vision of the seers and writers of the sacred books . ''

		Readers of '' ^ i 's '' poems remember them as the records of certain spiritual experiences as suggestive , and often as beautiful , as they are rare in the lives of the vast majority of unmeditative , incurious people .

		By the exercise of will power and concen - tration `` JE '' is able to attain to that vision of the divine world about us whose existence he now at - tempts to prove .

		`` There is no personal virtue in me other than this , that I followed a path all may travel , but on which few do journey . ''

		With this modest postulate which , at all events , clears the writer of all suspicion of the charlatanism so fre - quently prevalent to the detriment of psychical re - search , `` JE '' selects a number of spiritual adven - tures and endeavors to reveal their significance .

		T < this end his account is restricted to experiences whicl have some similarity to those of our common dreams `` not because they are in any way wonderful , bu rather because they are like things many people see and so they may more readily follow my argument . '

		Many eloquent and beautiful pages are given t -LRB- this retrospective narrative of dreams , visions , anc imaginations since the poet 's boyhood , when th < `` mysterious life quickening / - within my life '' begar to reveal itself .

		They are revelations rather thar proofs of a doctrine which appeals to reason whil < defying it .

		`` 2E '' proceeds very reasonably to ex plain how these first `` intimations of immortality ' came to him , and how he set himself by concen trated meditation to obtain control of the mean !

		of access to the divine universe , to that pleroma oi the Gnostics .

		The labor of concentration , the rigic setting of the faculties upon some mental object leaves the neophyte `` trembling as at the close of i laborious day . ''

		A thousand conflicting desires anc emotions crowd in upon the brain to deflect the wil from its purpose ; but once the power of concentra - tion has been acquired , `` the inexpressible yearning of the inner man to go out with the infinite '' ma -RRB- be satisfied .

		Through this discipline '' ^ E '' passed and he invites others to follow him and to share the ecstasies and wonders of the visions of super - nature thus obtained .

		He tells of the power sc won , by virtue of which a word in the page of a book could transport him to scenes stored up in the Eternal Memory ; of the flickering through his brain of pictures in the minds of friends and strangers ; of sudden illuminations of the darkness shrouding past and future , in which he saw phan - tasms of the life of ancient
Ireland	LOCATION	and the avatar THE DIAL
January	DATE	n f our race , the `` child of destiny around whom he future of
Ireland	LOCATION	was to pivot . ''

		If in many of hese pictures `` AL '' strays from the line of com - lon experience to which he promised to keep in is selection , nobody will regret that , in exchange , e has given us some beautiful , suggestive , and wonderful adventures of an artist 's soul .

		After all : is doubtful if more than a fraction of the public / ill , if honest , * do more than grant his premises n order to hear what he has to tell .

		`` JE . ''

		prom - > es the same powers of vision and imagination to very disciple ; but if we eliminate , as is often so lifficult , the pseudo-mystics from those who are ruly psychic , it must inevitably be the case that lany are called but few are chosen .

		The elimination of the fakers and table-turning mateurs of cheap mysteries is essential if we are ver to have serious attention paid to psychical evelations . ''

		/ E , '' so happily free from the stigma f the mystery-mongers , has been able to raise in his book some points of the deepest interest .

		He ries , and asks us to try , to discover what element f truth lies in imagination .

		He can not accept the acile methods of the now fashionable psycho - nalysts who can explain everything by reference memory and suppressed desires .

		Assuming that mr dreams are old memories refashioned `` yE '' sks : \ 7 hat is it combines with such miraculous skill the nings seen , taking a tint here , a fragment of form here , which uses the colours and forms of memory as palette to paint such masterpieces ?

		Vnd he argues that it is `` just as marvelous but lot so credible '' to assume that there is an artistic acuity in the subconscious memory , as to believe , yith him , that dreams come `` not by way of the ihysical senses transformed to memory , '' but `` like he image thought transferred , or by obscure ways effected from spheres above us , from the lives of ithers and the visions of others . ''

		The figures of Ireams move ; `` they have life and expression .

		The unlight casts authentic moving shadows on the ground . ''

		How can such effects be produced by igures composed of innumerable fixed impressions n the brain , which , if recombind , could hardly nake a more lifelike effect than a face composed f a hundred thousand pictures of heads refashioned ind pasted together ?

		Dreams are explicable , as `` yE '' sees it , in either > f two ways ; they are `` self-created fantasy '' or `` the nirroring in the brain of an experience of soul in 1 real sphere of being . ''

		While this provides an : scape from the irritating dogmatism of the Freudian scientists , it leaves `` the plain workaday people '' no further advanced in the discussion .

		Whichever of '' ^ E 's '' theories one accepts , `` we must postulate an unsleeping consciousness within ourselves while the brain is asleep ; and the unsleeping creature was either the creator of the dream or the actor in a real event . ''

		He likens himself in one case to `` a man in a dark hall so utterly lightless , so soundless , that nothing reaches him ; and then the door is suddenly flung open , and he sees a crowd hurrying by , and then the door is closed , and he is again in darkness . ''

		Such is the dream which is not `` self - created fantasy , '' but a sudden consciousness of being in another sphere where a glimpse is obtained of events whose beginning and end are not seen : On that hypothesis there were journeyings of the soul before and after the moment remembered , but the action in priority and succession 1 could not remember , be - cause there was as yet no kinship in the brain to the mood of the unsleeping soul or to the deed it did .

		Arising out of this interpretation of dreams , and governing the two-fold hypothesis of '' / K , '' there is an interesting analysis of the difference between im - agination and vision , although the two are often confounded .

		`` If I look out of the windows of the soul , '' he writes , that is not an act of imagination , but a `` vision of something which already exists , and which in itself must be unchanged by the act of seeing . ''

		On the other hand , `` by imagination what exists in latency or essence is outrealised and is given a form in thought , and we can contemplate with full consciousness that which hitherto has been unrevealed , or only intuitionally surmised . ''

		Hence it follows that the images of imagination may be referred `` definitely to an internal creator , with power to use or re-mould pre-existing forms and endow them with life , motion and voice . ''

		In other words , that artist in our subconsciousness whose power to refashion memories was defined by `` AL '' as `` just as marvelous but not so credible '' as his own theory , is now postulated to explain the acts of imagination as distinct from vision .

		The differ - entiation is important , granting the author 's funda - mental theory of the universe , but he is expecting too much of the unconverted when he asks them to endow imagination with creative faculties denied in the case of memory .

		The more so as he has by no means succeeded in showing a real divergence be - tween acts of vision and acts of imagination .

		The phenomena described in both cases are to the un - initiated remarkably similar .

		The dreams recorded , wonderful as many of them are , may be traced to memories , and since there is evidently a mysterious power of refashioning the impressions received by the brain , it is possible to explain '' ^ E 's '' visions and dreams by the hypothesis he rejects .

		At no time does he seem to be aware of
1919	DATE	THE DIAL the important fact that the mind records uncon - sciously innumerable impressions .

		He writes as if he could always be certain of exactly what phenom - ena have been impressed upon his memory , and he argues that when he sees in dreams something of which he had no earthly knowledge this is a proof of supernatural revelation .

		But I fancy that any reader with a knowledge of physics and of sailing , for example , could show `` JE '' how his description of the aerial ships is the obvious result of a lay - man 's vague recollections of matters with which he has no real acquaintance .

		His airships have steer - ing wheels , though they move in no element in which they could be so controlled surely an in - stance of a landsman 's unscientific memory , recalling the casually observed fact that ships are steered by a wheel .

		Indeed it will be evident to anyone who analyzes `` AL 's '' pictures that they are essentially refashioned memories , colored , it is true , by the artistic and metaphysical preoccupations of the author .

		Had his mind been stored with other lore than the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	scriptures , had his eye been that of a mechanical engineer instead of an artist , his imaginations and visions would have been molded accordingly .

		Unless perhaps they were entirely ex - tinguished !

		These points are merely a few amongst the man suggested by this unique spiritual autobiography which is packed with ideas and richly colored wit beautiful reveries .

		It is not only an essential pai of the work which `` JE '' has given to the worl in his verse but it opens up the most attractive fielc of speculation .

		Here is a man who has found new way to truth and knowledge , and who is on !

		too anxious to submit his methods for examinatio and to invite others to adopt them .

		If the grez metaphysicians and philosophers had essayed the : strange paths along which `` AL '' has pursued h quest , they might have arrived at a perception < life more vital to an age conscious of the limitatior of reason .

		Will and imagination , so large a factc in this mystic doctrine of the universe were the not the basis ' of
Schopenhauer	PERSON	's metaphysic ?

		Steepe as he was in the sacred writings of the
East	LOCATION	, whic have meant so much to `` M , '' he just failed 1 realize their teaching .

		If in the end The Candle -LRB- Vision brings us no nearer than before to the sob tion of the profound mystery of being , it renews a old approach to the mysterious problem which cha lenges the intelligence of humanity .


ERNEST A. BOYD	PERSON	.

		The American Soldier X \ MERICAN LITERATURE of the war has passed through several phases as marked as the phases of our interest and participation in the conflict itself .

		The outbreak of the war found us intellectually unprepared , and there followed a feverish eruption of explanation .

		Studies of national ambitions , trade rivalries , diplomatic backgrounds were quickly placed before the public .

		Then as our citizens became engaged in relief work , or sporadically as combatants , their immediate view of the phenomena of the war and personal experience in it became staple .

		As our neutrality wore thin and it became clear that we should be involved in the final phase as arbiter if not as contestant , there appeared fore - casts of the settlement in which we must have a part .

		And when we became belligerent the literature of the war naturally turned to a record of our participa - tion .

		These several phases have belonged to differ - ent classes of writers the first to historians , pub - licists , and other informed persons ; the second to adventurers ; the third to social philosophers and economists ; and only in the fourth has the war correspondent come distinctly into his own .

		Of this final phase two books , both by well-known corre - spondents , command attention
Frederick Palmer	PERSON	's
America	LOCATION	in
France	LOCATION	-LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead	LOCATION	;
$ 1.75	MONEY	-RRB- an
Floyd Gibbons	PERSON	' And They Thought We Wouldn Fight -LRB-
George H. Doran	PERSON	;
$ 2	MONEY	-RRB- .

		The titles of these books correctly prophesy the contents , style , and general approach .

		Mr.
Palmi	PERSON	writes as a historian a plain unvarnished tal From his position on General Pershing 's staff ; censor we may assume that his book is the resu of the fullest information and of the highest di cretion .

		It is in fact the first complete official vie of
America	LOCATION	's part in the war .

		And with evei allowance for reserve it is a convincing as well ; an impressive one .

		Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	writes as a historiar he also writes as a soldier , not only with an effac ment of himself but also a modesty in regard to h fellow soldiers which is both engaging and inspirin ; There is in his book little of the tone of person ; reminiscence , little anecdote and illustration .

		Tl impression which emerges is that of a whole , powerful and , highly organized machine , in whic the individual is not lost indeed , but multiplie until his personal record is an impertinence .

		M
Palmer	PERSON	does not disguise the fact that the machir did not work perfectly , ' that there were errors i direction , shortcomings in execution .

		What he in 34 THE DIAL
January	DATE	n plies however is the superhuman effort , the extremity of toil and sacrifice , with which the individual member of the vast complex set himself to limit the area of mistake and make good the effects of shortage .

		It is easy to divine beneath the surface of his narrative of a successful army the vital con - tribution of the man , not only behind the gun , but behind the telephone receiver , the motor wheel , even the ledger and the counter .

		And this is the view which
America	LOCATION	will be glad to take in the future a view of the campaign in
France	LOCATION	as a national enterprise in which the qual - ities which had marked the geographical , industrial , and scientific expansion of the nation were directed to a single end , animated by miraculous energy , crowned by complete achievement , and glorified by heroic sacrifice .

		Mr.
Floyd Gibbons	PERSON	, of the
Chicago Tribune	ORGANIZATION	, writes like a newspaper man .

		In reading his book one is reminded of his veteran predecessors , the correspondents of the Civil War , of
Browne	PERSON	and
Richardson	PERSON	, and of those classics , Four Years in
Secessia	LOCATION	and The Field , The Dungeon , and The Escape ; and one recognizes how much journalism has gained in amplitude and richness and raciness by the intensive cultivation of `` the story '' at the hands of the humbler members of the craft .

		Mr.
Gibbons	PERSON	has the closeness of contact with his ma - terial , the intimacy with his characters , the im - mediateness of style that mark the expert police or baseball reporter .

		His book is a succession of journalistic tours de force of which the first , the sinking of the
Laconia	LOCATION	, and the last , the wounding of the author during the taking of the
Belleau Woods	ORGANIZATION	by the American marines , are masterpieces worthy of
G. W. Steevens	PERSON	.

		Between these are lesser stories , the taking over of the first front-line sector by American troops , an inspection of the trenches , a raid into the enemy dugouts reported by telephone , a bombardment , and the rush of the
Second Division	ORGANIZATION	into
Picardy	LOCATION	to stem the German offensive .

		Where Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	is summary , Mr.
Gibbons	PERSON	is detailed ; where the former is literal and expository , the latter is picturesque and illustrative :
America	LOCATION	in
France	LOCATION	is detached and impersonal ; individual traits and inci - dents are the essence of And They Thought We Would n't Fight .

		Mr.
Gibbons	PERSON	made it his business to know the American soldier , not as an unidentifiable factor in the grim unity of his formations , but as the individ - ual , who accepts regimentation with the same humorous stoicism with which he accepts war .

		Mr.
Gibbons	PERSON	constantly allows him to escape from his enforced into his real character , to appear as
Big Moriarity	ORGANIZATION	, or
Missouri	LOCATION	Slim , or the dying Wop .

		From the multitude of incidents he disengages the American soldier as a type , distinct as the French poilu of Barbusse or the
British Tommy of Captain Beith	ORGANIZATION	a national figure although racially of Italian , English ,
Celtic	ORGANIZATION	, Slavic , or Teutonic extraction .

		It would be impossible to recreate this figure in a critical summary , but some of his salient traits may be enumerated his imperturbable coolness , his in - solent courage , his disconcerting unexpectedness , his tolerant good nature , his humor that surmounts pain , and his irony that circumvents fate .

		And a few bits of his lively conversation may be quoted .

		The men in the tree-top lookout waiting for the German fire : `` Why in hell do n't they come back at us ? ''


Griffith	PERSON	asks .

		`` I 've had myself all tuned up for the last twenty minutes to have a leg blown off and be thankful .

		I hate this waiting stuff . ''

		`` Keep your shirt on ,
Pete	PERSON	, ''
Stanton	PERSON	remarks .

		`` Give 'em a chance to get their breath and come out of their holes .

		That barrage drove 'em down a couple hundred feet into the ground and they have n't any elevators to come up on . ''

		The wireless operator in the open summerhouse : `` Seems so peaceful here with the sun streaming down over these old walls , '' he said .

		`` What do you hear out of the air ? ''

		I asked .

		`` Oh , we pick up a lot of junk , '' he replied ... `` A few minutes ago I heard a German aeroplane signaling by wireless to a German battery and directing its fire .

		I could tell every time the aviator said the shot was short or over .

		It 's kinder funny to sit back here in quiet and listen in on the war , is n't it ? ''


Dan Bailey	PERSON	, who had lost a leg at Cantigny : `` I know what I 'm going to do when I get home , '' he said .

		`` I 'm going to get a job as an instructor in a roller - skating rink . ''

		The record of the American soldier as revealed in both these books is a valuable comment on democ - racy in war .

		After all , the practical issue between democracy and autocracy turned on the question of relative efficiency in the test of survival in direct conflict of arms .

		It was the belief of autocracy in the essential military unfitness of democracy that gave it confidence in forcing the issues that inevit - ably added first
England	LOCATION	and later
America	LOCATION	to its enemies .

		It appeared to the best authorities that the complicated processes of modern warfare could not be learned by the ordinary citizen in less than two years of intensive training that a system of instruction of such levies could not be maintained except by a military caste with a tradition of su - periority to the body of citizens that reflected the autocracy of the state .

		Above all , the testing of armies in maneuver and the constant practice of the general staff in handling large bodies of men and material was deemed essential .

		It is true that
America	LOCATION	entered the war under tutelage that our 35 unpreparedness was in part at the expense of our allies .

		But granting the contribution of staff work and of instruction in major and minor tactics , which was so generously given , the attainment of the American officers and men gives ground for belief in the ability of democracy to take care of itself .

		What part if any our high command played in the major strategy of the last months of the war may never be disclosed .

		Even the story of the Amer - ican general who took personal responsibility for the counter-offensive at
Chateau-Thierry	LOCATION	may re - main apocryphal .

		But the mastery of the art of war by field officers and men of the American forces is an achievement in education of which the example should not be lost .

		The result was brought about by an extraordinary spirit of cooperation between officers and men .

		Apart from a small number avail - able for active service in the regular army and na - tional guard , our officers were college boys sum - moned to turn their training to a field which they had never thought to enter .

		Their success was per - haps a surprise to the faculties which had trained them .

		They had to teach themselves , and each other , and their men .

		The men taught them - selves and each other .

		The limited expert instruction provided was economized to the last degree , used as leaven in the whole effervescing mass .

		And as a result our army became an extraordinarily flexible and responsive instrument , preserving the best fea - tures of democratic organization .

		The officers could not send their men into battle in rigid formations , trained to mechanical exactness of maneuver at word of command , but they could lead them anywhere .

		The result was , it is true , in the American as in the English army , which was trained on essentially the same principle , a disproportionate loss of officers .

		That is the price which democracy must always pay for being the sacrifice of its leaders .

		But that the individual maintained himself in spite of the draft and the training and the discipline the whole proc - ess of regimentation and will return personally the richer for his experience , no one who reads these volumes can doubt .

		In his justification of democ - racy as against autocracy in war the American soldier recalls the boast of Pericles to the Athenians : `` Whereas the Spartans from early youth are al - ways undergoing laborious exercises which are to make them brave , we live at ease yet are equally ready to face danger .

MORSS LOVETT	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
Economic Interpretation of History	ORGANIZATION	: A Footnote AlAiLED by some votaries of the political sciences as a generalization comparable with the theory of evolution , the economic interpretation of history has found small favor in the eyes of anthropologists .

		This is not due to any peculiarly bourgeois atmos - phere that invests anthropological thought , as ex - treme adherents .

		of the materialistic conception might assume .

		The grounds for an a priori bias against that view lie in quite different directions .

		For one thing , the complexities of civilization even in its humbler levels are such that antagonism is at once roused by advertisements of any vaunted master key , whether economic or geographical or what not .

		On the other hand , the students of human culture are rightly suspicious of any attempt to make reason shoulder the responsibility for most or even for much of what mankind has done .

		They are so constantly confronted with the power of other impulses that ideological rather than utilitarian motives loom large in their consciousness as primary causes of human action .

		When , for example , a Crow Indian imperiled his life crawling into the midst of the enemy 's camp in order to steal a horse tethered to the tent pegs , it is difficult to hold that he was prompted by ari economic motive , seeing that he could much more readily have stolen several un - picketed horses roaming about the outskirts .

		If he chose the more arduous method , it was to gain not any material benefit but social prestige , which was attainable only through some traditionally recog - nized act of bravery .

		Nevertheless every exaggeration in the realm of thought seems bound to lead as a normal reaction to an equal and contrary perversity .

		The very super - ciliousness with which the modern ethnologist re - jects economic causation invites a cautious reexamina - tion of the ground .

		Obviously , the most favorable conditions for a fair test of economic influences on the structure of society would obtain if we had knowledge of a given community at one stage and equally satisfactory knowledge of the same com - munity at a later period when some basic change of economic existence had supervened .

		Our Western civilization hardly furnishes a satisfactory illustra - tion , because its complexity obscures the factors at work .

		Simpler modes of life , while better suited for the purpose , present difficulties of a different kind .

		Contact with the Caucasian race frequently produces far-reaching changes in economic activity , but frequently this modification is accompanied by THE DIAL
January	DATE	i i such disintegration of aboriginal life that nothing can be inferred as to the influence due to an enforced change from , say , the chase to agriculture .

		Again , where the touch of civilization has not proved disas - trous as among the
Navaho of Arizona	ORGANIZATION	we know little or nothing of the earlier status of the people examined ; we can not say what has been the effect of stock-raising on
Navaho	ORGANIZATION	custom and thought , for the simple reason that records are wanting for the ancient life of this tribe before the Spaniards had taught them to rear sheep .

		Yet the case is not utterly hopeless , and the north - easternmost part of
Siberia	LOCATION	furnishes us with most instructive data .

		In this region we encounter a primitive tribe known as the
Chukchi	ORGANIZATION	, which is divided into two groups differing widely as to their mode of subsistence .

		The Maritime branch con - , tinues to support itself by fishing and hunting in the ancestral fashion , presenting on the whole a re - markably Eskimo-like type of Arctic culture .

		With the remainder of the Chukchi these methods of gain - ing a livelihood are overshadowed by utilization of domesticated reindeer , a feature borrowed from other Siberian aborigines in relatively recent times .

		A comparison of the Maritime and the Reindeer Chukchi thus supplies us with a definite test of what changes may follow a modification of eco - nomic conditions ; and we are particularly fortu - nate in being able to derive our data from
Bogoras	PERSON	' monograph , one of the classics of modern ethnog - raphy for amplitude of detail and trustworthiness .

		Very significant differences appear in matrimonial relations .

		The Maritime Chukchi is not nearly so dependent on a woman 's care as the reindeer-breeder , whose tents and clothes demand constant attention .

		Accordingly bachelorhood is more common among the sea-hunters than with the reindeer-breeders .

		The
Maritime Chukchi	ORGANIZATION	is barely able to provide for one woman and her issue , so that even bigamy is extremely rare , while a wealthy Reindeer Chukchi often has one wife to take care of each of his herds .

		The need of assistants to tend the reindeer has also fostered a particular form of courtship the scrip - tural method of gaining a bride by rendering a herdsman 's services to her father .

		Equally suggest - ive is the status of members of the family .

		In both groups woman normally is in a subordinate position , but while the wives of the Reindeer Chukchi have much the harder labor they also have an occasional chance to gain the ascendancy .

		When a widow has appropriated her husband 's herd she plays the domi - nant role during her children 's minority and may lord it over a second spouse .

		The influence of property in fashioning customary law is even more clearly seen in the position of children and father .

		Since the herd requires everlasting care , boys and girls of ten are often impressed into the service , while Maritime children of considerably greater age continue the care-free existence of youth .

		A rein - deer-owner is master of valuable property and as such exacts obedience and deference even in senility .

		Not so among the sea-hunters , where success is de - pendent on physical prowess , where every morsel of food is the result of labor and privation .

		Here the old men automatically drop out of the race and are degraded to the position of tolerated dependents .

		With the Maritime people there is little to rouse native cupidity , and theft is relatively rare .

		The introduction of reindeer greatly stimulated theft and avarice .

		A traveler through Maritime terri - tory is entertained scot-free for several days ; and a host will not stop short of sacrificing his sledge or house-supports to furnish fuel .

		In striking contrast to such generosity stands the custom of the Rein - deer people inhospitable to the point of churlish - ness and unscrupulous in stealing their guest 's pos - sessions .

		Finally may be mentioned an illustration of the subtle influence exerted by the very fact of property rights .

		Property becomes in a way an end in itself , as in modern rules of primogeniture .

		With the Maritime people , to be sure , the eldest son gets the best share of his father 's implements , but the house is simply broken down and its contents divided among the survivors .

		Such division strikes the Rein - deer Chukchi as almost sacrilegious .

		The house must descend to the heir-apparent undivided .

		Fail - ing issue , a wealthy reindeer-breeder will go to any lengths to perpetuate his hoard by adopting a remote relative or transmitting the whole to a friend .

		It seems to have been only within the last hundred years that the Chukchi developed into intensive rein - deer-breeders .

		During this extremely brief span of time , then , economic specialization has produced pro- found alterations in the social usages of the Chukchi nay , in their very outlook on life and their ulti - mate ideals .

		In view of the ocular demonstration supplied by a comparison of the Maritime and the Reindeer Chukchi , the total rejection of economic factors as a cultural force appears untenable .

		Doubtless they are even in this instance far from being the only ones .

		A sane appraisal of their effi - cacy may be suggested by an analogy from the his - tory of philosophy .

		The early Greek philosophers ' attempt to describe the universe solely in terms of water is no longer more than a metaphysical curios - ity ; but no one doubts the important part which water has played in the fashioning of the globe .

		An assumed cause may not be omnipotent , yet it may be very far indeed from being reduced to impotence .


ROBERT H. LOWIE	PERSON	.

		1919 THE DIAL 37
London	LOCATION	,
December 9	DATE	IHE CHEERFUL turmoil of the armistice celebra - tions has been succeeded here by the more doubtful turmoil of a General Election ; and but for one circumstance literature would have been swamped .

		This one circumstance is the fact that the
Labor Party	ORGANIZATION	is the rising force in British politics ; and
the Labor Party	ORGANIZATION	, since the revision of its basis by which it opened its arms to mental as well as manual work - ers , seems to be regarded by British authors with more enthusiasm than any other .

		We all expected as a consequence of this that several of the Labor candidates would be men of letters ; but our expecta - tions have been disappointed , save by Mr.
J. C. Squire	PERSON	, who is standing for
the University of Cam	ORGANIZATION	- bridge .

		He will probably not succeed at the first attempt ; but he will lay a foundation for the future .

		In that future Mr.
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	, who adds to a complete understanding of the agricultural laborer a capacity for writing poetry about him , may be persuaded to reconsider his decision not to stand ; and encouraged by these examples others may enter the field .

		Then we shall have what I think we have never had before , poets and authors in the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	who , on taking their seats , will remain poets and authors just as much as a stockbroker remains a stockbroker .

		Hitherto the nearest ap - proach we have had has been in journalists who have decided to * subordinate journalism to the more im - posing career of politics .

		And then , I suppose , the millennium will begin ; or at least the claims of literature will receive attention commensurable with that given to the claims of cheese .

		Certainly if women have deserved the vote by their indispensability during the war , authors , for ^ he same reason , have deserved a greater influence on affairs .

		Our Government surprisingly perceived that literature might be used to strengthen opinion ; and this being truly remarkable they asked a number of literary men to advise them how it should be done .

		They also appointed Colonel
John Buchan	PERSON	to be Director , of Propaganda .

		Colonel
Buchan	PERSON	is a publisher and also the genial author of a number of `` shockers '' which are better written than most of their kind .

		The choice might have bee ^ better : it might also have been worse .

		Colonel
Buchan	PERSON	did his work well , if not with much imagination or much alertness to the latest movements .

		I am told that when he interviewed a young , rather advanced painter who sought the post of `` Official Artist '' at the front , he remarked , in a time-honored formula , that he knew nothing about pictures but he knew what he liked and further added , ingratiatingly , that the works of the man to whom he was talking looked as though they might have been done by a child of seven .

		However , the young painter got his appoint - ment .

		This of course was too good to last ; and presently
Colonel Buchan	PERSON	had put over his head a `` Minister of Information , ''
Lord Beaverbrooke	PERSON	, a Canadian financier , whose chief connection with literature consisted in his recent acquisition of con - trol over a
London	LOCATION	morning paper .

		Of him I am told that one day early this year he asked one of his departments to furnish him with a list of the most successful English war-poets .

		In due course the list arrived , headed by the name of
Rupert Brooke	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Minister of Information then directed one of his secretaries to write to Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	, making an appointment for an interview .

		Lord
Beaverbrooke	PERSON	did , however , introduce into his Ministry a real man of letters in the person of Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	; and , not long before the cessation of hostilities , Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	attained a position there equivalent to that of
Permanent Under-Secretary of State	ORGANIZATION	in one of the
War Department Offices	ORGANIZATION	.

		I do not know how to convey to anyone not intimately acquainted with our social structure what a solidly and respectably glorious position this is .

		I can only say that it is solid and respectable and glorious indeed .

		I look forward with excitement to the description which Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	, now unchained , will surely give us of his sensations in it .

		In addition to these , other men of letters have made themselves useful in various branches of the public service .

		Mr.
Walter	PERSON	de la
Mare	ORGANIZATION	has decorated as well as strengthened the
Ministry of Food	ORGANIZATION	; a little group has introduced some intelligence into the
Intelligence Department	ORGANIZATION	of the War Office , and others have found employ - ment in the Censorship .

		Some have even received some of the mysterious orders and distinctions which are now distributed with a lavish hand .

		So we may fairly claim to have played our part in the civilian life of our nation at war .

		Now that the normal Status of things is returning and the ordinary chan - nel into public life is again Parliamentary politics rather than bureaucratic employment , I trust we shall forget neither our rights nor our duties .

		Poets are now , curiously , regarded as useful and worthy members of society ; and
the Labor Party	ORGANIZATION	might brighten the rather drab ranks of its legions by adopting a few more as candidates .

		THE DIAL
January 1 1	DATE	We are thus , you will perceive , all rather turned outward upon the nation 's affairs than inward upon our own .

		This will account for the fact that the autumn publishing season has been , on the whole , rather dull .

		There has been a new volume of poems by Mr.
W. H. Davies	PERSON	, a book by Mr.
Hud	PERSON	- son , this , that , and the other all very pleasant to have .

		The publication of
Swinburne	ORGANIZATION	's letters -LRB- the real collection this time -RRB- and the appearance of an enormous work by Sir
James Frazer	PERSON	called Folklore in the Old Testament , are events ; but they are productive rather of satisfaction than of rapture .

		No great genius has suddenly flamed into sight ; nor is it probable that any of us should yet have noticed him if he had .

		-LRB- I must put it on record that I am aware of the logical flaw in this sentence ; and I leave it at that . -RRB-

		One attractive and interesting personality has been removed from us by the death , the compara - tively early death , of Mr.
Robert Ross	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Ross	PERSON	was a writer and an art critic with his own claims to distinction ; but he was best known in the general world of letters as the devoted friend and posthu - mous defender of Oscar Wilde .

		The cult of
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	has been to me always a rather incomprehensible thing .

		That he was a wit I will readily believe ; that he was a great poet even in The Ballad of Reading Gaol , which nevertheless has a certain power , I am prepared stoutly to deny .

		His career and his pose , the things for which he was first fol - lowed and then pursued , were frankly borrowed ; and I can not bring myself to think that he was a great man .

		Yet there is something potent in his memory which still sets people by the ears ; and no long intervals elapse between law cases -LRB- mostly libel actions -RRB- in which infuriated litigants throw his name at one another across a pleasantly scandalized court .

		One of
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's own associates in particular , who had repented that connection , spent much energy in chasing Mr.
Ross	PERSON	, who was far from re - penting ; and this -LRB- one would think , somewhat un - necessary -RRB- enthusiasm must have been one of the principal curses of Mr.
Ross	PERSON	' life .

		Yet he never wavered in his faith or sought to dissemble it ; and I verily believe that he died holding Wilde to have been an epoch-making artist .

		One can not but ad - mire so much steadfastness based on so inadequate a foundation .

		Perhaps now that Mr.
Ross	PERSON	is gone we shall hear
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's name mentioned less often in a good or an evil connection .

		Yet I doubt it .

		Early this year he and his factitious wickedness turned up in the ridiculous Pemberton-Billing affair apropos of German influence in
England	LOCATION	, so it is difficult to say that any train of thought can not reach the same goal .

		I do not think that it matters very much .

		But it is one of the minor curiosities of life that a person so essentially of the second rate should have proved so disconcertingly immortal .

		The evil that men do rarely lives after them in so obvious a shape and still more rarely , I think , does so little harm .

		There was a time when
Wilde	PERSON	was looked to as the regenerator of the English theater ; and The Importance , of
Being Earnest	LOCATION	is , I suppose , still the most perfect stage-play we have had since
Congreve	ORGANIZATION	.

		But one comedy does not make a renaissance ; and
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's other plays all led into a cul-de-sac .

		We were still looking for the regenerator -LRB- there had been several other candidates in the meanwhile -RRB- when the war broke out and suspended dramatic activity to make way for the sort of play that is expected to amuse subalterns home on leave .

		I am led into this train of thought by reading a volume of reprinted essays by a very clever dramatic critic , Captain
James E. Agate	PERSON	.

		His book Buzz !

		Buzz !

		-LRB-
Collins	ORGANIZATION	; 6s . -RRB-

		is as clever as its title , which , unless you are much quicker than I am , you have not yet recognized as Shakespearean quotation .

		But it in - duced in me a feeling of profound weariness .

		Are we , I asked myself , to begin all over again the hope - less struggle to force the intellectual drama -LRB- thrice damnable phrase -RRB- down the throats of audiences who very sensibly do not want it ?

		Are .

		we to de - velop again , having mercifully forgotten it , that old factitious enthusiasm for the inexpressibly gloomy works of innumerable Germans , Swedes , Czechs , and other aliens , and to allow to grow in ourselves , or , at the worst , to foster , that feeling of superiority over the uninstructed which is generated by the visual knowledge of their unspeakable -LRB- I use the word literally , of course -RRB- names ?

		Are we , I cried as my despair rose unquenchably , to submit to end - less courses of plays by
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	, in which the undeniable treasures of wit and fancy are corrupted by theories that have already begun to decay , mostly because there is nothing else we can honestly affirm to be more amusing than A
Week-End	DATE	at
Brighton	LOCATION	, the latest adapted French farce , or Cheer Up !

		, the All-Legs Revue ?

		But , after all , there is hope , for us in the distance .

		A play exists by the late
James Avoy Hecker	PERSON	which , I am told , is the best poetic drama since
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		I put my faith , then , in a poetic theater which , apart from this , does not yet exist .

		But more on this another time .

		Already I overrun my space .

		THE DIAL
GEORGE DONLIN JOHN DEWEY ROBERT MORSS LOVETT	PERSON	, Editor
CLARENCE BRITTEN	PERSON	In Charge of the Reconstruction Program :
THORSTEIN VEBLEN HAROLD STEARNS HELEN MARCH	PERSON	- ON WHAT TERMS WILL
RUSSIA	LOCATION	BE PERMITTED TO enter the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	?

		What price , political and economic , must she pay for inclusion in the world confederation that is to give common security and protection to all states ?

		Those who speak for Soviet
Russia	LOCATION	and those who speak for the dis - gruntled groups representing the opposing factions have already asked these questions , but thus far the questions have remained unanswered .

		It is now reasonably certain that no delegates will be con - sidered accredited by
Russia	LOCATION	to the peace confer - ence , and that her fate as
M. Clemenceau	PERSON	said in his speech to the Chamber of Deputies on
December 30	DATE	would be equally true of `` the fate of nations in all parts of the world '' - will be determined by her former Allies ,
France	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	, and
America	LOCATION	.

		Admittedly the policy which is to be pursued to - wards
Russia	LOCATION	is of first-rate importance for the future peace of the world .

		Thus far , in spite of Senator
Johnson	PERSON	's spirited and just queries , this
Government	ORGANIZATION	has not seen fit to enlighten its citizens .

		Lord
Milner	PERSON	, speaking for the
British Government	ORGANIZATION	, has given some explanation , feeble and inadequate though it be .

		He has stated that it would be a flagrant violation of British honor if those Russians who had aided the intervening troops were left to the tender mercies of the
Bolsheviki	LOCATION	.


M. Pichon	PERSON	, speaking for the
French Government	ORGANIZATION	, has given his explanation too .

		It is : intervention was `` inevitable '' -LRB- he does not state exactly why -RRB- ; intervention has be - come `` defensive '' in order to prevent the Bolsheviki from invading the
Ukraine	LOCATION	, the
Caucasus	LOCATION	, and West - ern
Siberia	LOCATION	.

		But he is franker than his British col - league .

		Amidst a storm of protest from the benches of the Left and cries of `` The war is beginning anew ! ''

		M. Pichon went on to explain that `` in the future '' an offensive intervention might be necessary in order to `` destroy '' Bolshevism .

		French troops are fighting the Russian `` Republican '' army in
Odessa	LOCATION	and
Sebastopol	LOCATION	, and British troops have al - ready landed at
Riga	LOCATION	,
Reval	ORGANIZATION	, and
Helsingfors	ORGANIZATION	.

		Our own
War Trade Board	ORGANIZATION	has authorized shipments of goods to
Finland	LOCATION	where the
White Guard	ORGANIZATION	has cooperated with the Germans in driving out the
Bolsheviki	LOCATION	and to those parts of
Siberia	LOCATION	under control of the `` Army of Occupation . ''

		Briefly , then , the avowed intentions of the statesmen of the Allies who have condescended to speak , and the overt acts of all the Governments of the Entente , give a clear clue to the policy to be pursued towards
Russia	LOCATION	.

		Under no circumstances is
Soviet Russia	LOCATION	to be recog - nized or to be admitted to the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	.

		Tempered only by the war-weariness of their own peoples and the degree of skepticism which may be aroused in even the most gullible of publics , the Governments of the Allies intend to destroy Soviet
Russia	LOCATION	root and branch .

		Yet as a matter of fact this failure to gain political recognition would not particularly disturb the leaders of
Soviet Russia	LOCATION	if they could in any way arrange for economic coopera - tion with the Governments of their former Allies .

		But the destruction contemplated is not mere po - litical isolation from the benefits of the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	: it is actual economic destruction .

		Some time ago the Soviet Government bought and paid for nets and fishing instruments in
Norway	LOCATION	.

		The goods were shipped ; on
October 26	DATE	the boat trans - porting them was stopped and the goods seized by the British .

		Other purchases in neutral countries have been prevented from leaving the warehouses .

		The economic blockade is effective .

		Was it irony on the part of
M. Pichon	PERSON	when in the speech above quoted he gracefully referred to the fact that because
France	LOCATION	had already given so much to the common cause `` our allies should contribute to this intervention on a larger scale than we '' ?

		Not entirely irony .

		For
M. Pichon	PERSON	was not thinking merely of
Great Britain	LOCATION	's effective blockade against
Russia	LOCATION	.

		The hint was pretty plain that a large share of the task of destroying Soviet
Russia	LOCATION	should in justice devolve upon the
United States	LOCATION	, which has sacrificed far less proportionately than any other nation in the victory over vGermany .

		In a word , the
United States	LOCATION	is to furnish the economic help and , if neces - sary , the military assistance required to guarantee that neither a
Soviet Russia	LOCATION	nor
Germany	LOCATION	shall long continue to exist and to embarrass the victorious Governments of
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and
Italy	LOCATION	, who naturally enough see in a weak
Russia	LOCATION	, on the one hand , and in a `` stable ''
Germany	LOCATION	, on the other , the opportunity for exploitation of natural resources and for rich indemnities from a defeated and disciplined industrial nation .

		From every part of the
United States	LOCATION	should arise an uncompromising demand for the discontinuance of this imperialistic adventure into which our
Government	ORGANIZATION	is plunging us .

		THE DIAL
January	DATE	n OUPERFICIALLY , THE RESULTS OF THE BRITISH elections are discouraging to liberals :
Asquith	PERSON	,
Hen	ORGANIZATION	- derson ,
Snowden	PERSON	,
Macdonald	PERSON	are all defeated ; the Liberal and
Nationalist Parties	ORGANIZATION	are practically wiped out of existence ; Labor acquires only sixty-five seats instead of the expected 100 ;
Ireland	LOCATION	threatens civil war in its practical sweep for the
Sinn Fein	ORGANIZATION	; the Tories of
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and
America	LOCATION	pluck up heart and become shamelessly explicit in their de - mands for a punitive , vindictive peace .

		Yet the ad - verb `` superficially '' is merited .

		If a general election had been held in
Germany	LOCATION	three days after the start of the last
March	DATE	offensive , who can doubt that the results would have been overwhelmingly conserva - tive ?

		And in less than nine months
Germany	LOCATION	turns revolutionary .

		In the first flush of a victory that must have seemed as sudden as it was complete , it was hardly to be expected that
England	LOCATION	would repudiate the leader who had , in the popular mind at any rate , successfully brought her through the crisis .

		The day of election found
England	LOCATION	in a position more powerful and world dominant than she has ever occupied in her history as an empire .

		Was it to have been expected that a vote of confi - dence would then be denied ?

		But there are fur - ther considerations which make the Coalition vic - tory less significant than appears on the surface of the number of votes .


London	LOCATION	and
Scotland	LOCATION	polled less than half their electorate ;
Wales	LOCATION	, just half ; English boroughs and counties , a little more than half striking proof , if proof were needed , that to a large section of the electorate the contest was re - garded as unreal and that suspicion of parliamentari - anism is strong .

		Furthermore the system of `` proxy '' voting for the army inevitably produced a situation wherein about one third of the votes actually cast represented the considered political opinion of the men in khaki .

		It is noteworthy that most of the ballots cast out were from soldiers and that across the slips were written expressions like `` Send us home and we will vote , '' and `` We have no informa - tion about the candidates . ''

		Even granting , how - ever , that the Coalition victory represented the practically unanimous present day view of
England	LOCATION	, the evidence is definitive that a few weeks will see a marked shift in popular conviction .

		The whole problem of peace and reconstruction is placed squarely upon
Lloyd George	PERSON	's shoulders : he has given election hostages to fate in the form of all sorts of extravagant - promises .

		But if the word of English liberal journals is to be believed , the plans for demobilization of the army and the reabsorption of men into industry and the placing of them upon the land are as uncoordinated and .

		inadequate as our own .

		The
Lloyd George Government	ORGANIZATION	will be faced with a serious unemployment crisis before the
Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	has concluded its sittings .

		Ireland openly declares its intention to provoke serious military clashes before the conference finishes its work .

		And if many of the peace terms which
Lloyd George	PERSON	promised in the heat of the campaign are carried out literally , the result will be the increase of Bolshevism everywhere east of the Rhine , with consequent drains upon British finance and men for holding in check the very forces which the stupidity of its statesmen will have aroused .

		Every one of
Lloyd George	PERSON	's campaign chickens is coming home to roost and with a tag to show its paternity .

		Moreover the national unity which inevitably prevailed for a few weeks following the close of the most successful of wars is bound soon to disappear .

		The very intensity of the long political union sacree of the war proved its artificiality ; and with the relaxing of external hostility internal and domestic differences are cer - tain to be accentuated and sharpened .


Lloyd George	PERSON	has aroused high hopes ; if those hopes are disap - pointed , the resentment will be greater than would have been the case with a statesman who had modestly promised less .

		Labor should not now lose its opportunity .

		It should point out the mistakes and broken promises of the
Coalition	ORGANIZATION	regime calmly and without exaggeration .

		It should do everything in its power to strengthen the personnel of its lead - ers .

		For the indications are that
England	LOCATION	will see another
General Election	ORGANIZATION	before
summer	DATE	, and that the country will then look as hopefully to Labor as it is now looking to
Coalition	ORGANIZATION	.

		IHE CONVENTIONAL SOLDIERS ' MONUMENT , FOR all that is beautiful in the spirit that prompts its erec - tion , is not the least ugly by-product of war .

		But what impresses the beholder is not so much its ugli - ness and its appalling monotony in ugliness as its utter futility as a memorial .

		Spiked and rusting can - non in neglected corners have something to say , how - ever inappropriate ; but to whom do the lumps of granite and bronze which , after the Civil War , broke out upon the Northern states like a rash com - municate any notion of the passion for union , the hu - mane pity , and the intolerable sacrifices which they were piled up to commemorate ?

		And now that we are concluding another great war , waged in much the same spirit , and in hundreds of deeply roused communities , are gathering funds for memorials , shall we again trust an ugly and dumb masonry with the memory of those who have given that spirit the last full measure of devotion ?

		The
War Camp Community Service	ORGANIZATION	hopes we shall not .

		It pro- poses instead that we endow Community Houses , not unlike those the
Service	ORGANIZATION	has built to further its program of hospitality to men in uniform , and make them permanent `` living '' memorials to our soldiers .

		Such Houses , of course , would function differently in communities of differing size ; but there is no reason why each of them should not acquire its own technique for serving the everyday social needs of its common owners and at the same time of keeping alive the memory of these days .

		Cities might main - tain democratic auditoriums like Faneuil Hall or Independence Hall ; towns might transfer to the new
1919	DATE
THE DIAL House	ORGANIZATION	the richly varied activities which are begin - ning to cluster round community centers in the schools .

		Homes for community drama and music might be provided .

		Memorials like these would of necessity prove flexible in character , responsive to the changing spirit of their communities : they could not , as shafts of stone and metal must , become mere stubborn souvenirs of an archaic militarism .

		Phys - ically , they would be harder to make ugly in the first instance ; and certainly an initial ugliness could be remedied as the community 's taste improved .

		Jn the deafening barrage of after-the-war proposals from war-time committees this suggestion of the
War Camp Community Service	ORGANIZATION	is one to which we can profitably give ear .

		L ERHAPS THE MEMORY THAT WILL LIVE MOST VIV - idly of
Randolph Bourne	PERSON	is of his quick perception of sham and pretense .

		Pompous gentility and ritual - ism , whether encrusted convention or mere tradition , aroused his power of biting irony ; for graceful and engaging as was his satire , it never lacked the edge which gave it a peculiar distinction .

		Gifted with a fine and alert intelligence ,
Bourne	PERSON	coupled it with an extraordinary ability as a craftsman in writing .

		He could easily have won more substantial recogni - tion by employing his gifts in the service of the accepted and the acknowledged , but he never once played false to his spontaneous sympathies and his personal bias .

		The direction of those sympathies and that bias had become fairly clear even before his untimely death : he demanded of life richer esthetic experiences , the companionship of fuller intellectual straightforwardness , more emotional range and flexibility than his American environment could possibly yield without radical transformation .

		To that radical transformation
Bourne	PERSON	gave his best efforts and ability .

		In all of his work , whether in the book reviews that were themselves pieces of creative writing or in his books or articles on educa .

		- tion or even politics , he was always sharply insistent upon the contributions which our immigrants could make to our national life , mockingly contemptuous of the timidity and surviving Puritan shyness which rejected them .

		He exposed unerringly the staleness which comes from atrophy of the living spirit .

		Nor was he perturbed or frightened at the more un - toward forms which flaring rebellion might take he welcomed and understood them even when his atti - tude resulted in a kind of perversity of fairness although he refused to be beguiled by new formulas which were the mere fashionable radical escape from the old .

		His influence was a constant invigoration and challenge .

		The shibboleths and fine words of the day were examined in a merciless Socratic spirit .

		It was hardly in the way of systematic intellectual achievement that either his ability or his tempera - ment led him : he was rather a watchman and ques - tioner of the intellectual achievements of others a challenger whom even the greatest could not afford to ignore .

		Time would have matured his judgment and perhaps mellowed a wit as urbane as any in our tradition .

		But it would scarcely have changed the fundamental quality of his contribution to our in - tellectual life .

		The loss of that contribution is irremediable .

		All of us are the poorer for his going .

		IHE ATTITUDE OF THE DlAL IN REGARD TO
RUSSIA	LOCATION	would seem to need no further explanation , yet in answer to correspondence received since the number of
December 14	DATE	went into circulation , it may be well to restate it .

		First ,
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	regards the case of
Russia	LOCATION	as the most important of the problems affecting any one nation to be considered at the
Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	more important than
Germany	LOCATION	or Czecho-Slovakia or
Poland	LOCATION	or Jugo-Slavia or
France	LOCATION	or
Italy	LOCATION	or
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		It involves in the most fundamental way the whole question of democracy as affected by the relations between nations .

		As President
Wilson	PERSON	has said : The treatment accorded to
Russia	LOCATION	by her sister nations in the months to come will be the acid test of their good will , of their comprehension of her needs as distinguished from their own interests , and of their intelligent and unselfish sympathy .

		This problem is laid upon
America	LOCATION	the more ur - gently because
Russia	LOCATION	, in spite of the immense sac - rifices and sufferings of her people , will evidently not have an opportunity to speak for herself in that conference .

		Second , in order that public opinion in the
United States	LOCATION	may be informed in regard to the present state of affairs in
Russia	LOCATION	, the aims of her present Government , and the relation of that
Government	ORGANIZATION	to the Russian people , THE DIAL believes that the full - est publicity should be given to all the facts obtain - able .

		THE DIAL has no fear that the people of the
United States	LOCATION	will fail to give sympathy where it is due and material support where it is needed if they are allowed to understand the situation .

		It would be a monstrous result of the war for democracy now ended if as a result of restrictions upon freedom of speech the
United States	LOCATION	should drift into another war which the public mind has had no opportunity to understand or sanction .

		This would indeed be to reverse President
Wilson	PERSON	's motto : it would be Victory Without Peace .

		THE DIAL holds no brief for the present regime in
Russia	LOCATION	except in so far as it is misrepresented in a way to mislead public opinion in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		We shall publish from time to time state - ments of fact which have been verified ' , and im - portant documents which have been authenticated .

		THE DIAL is prepared to serve as a bureau of intelli - gence , to answer questions , to supply copies of docu - ments , to bring inquirers into contact with authorita - tive sources of information .

		It will act not in the spirit of propaganda but of truth .

		THE DIAL
January 1 1	DATE	Foreign Comment OPEN DIPLOMACY IN
RUSSIA	LOCATION	The following is a translation of the official declaration issued by the Russian Peace Delegation at the time of signing the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk ,
March 3 , 1918	DATE	: The Workmen 's and Peasants ' Government of the
Russian Republic	ORGANIZATION	, which has announced the cessation of war and has demobilized its army , is compelled by the attack of the German troops to accept the ultimatum pre - sented by
Germany	LOCATION	by announcement on the twenty-fourth of
February	DATE	and has delegated us to sign these terms which are being imposed on us by violence .

		The negotiations which previously took place in
Brest	LOCATION	- Litovsk between
Russia	LOCATION	on one side and
Germany	LOCATION	and her allies on the other made it evident to all that the so-called -LRB- by the German representatives -RRB- `` Peace of Agreement '' is in reality a peace definitely annexational and imperialistic .

		Now the
Brest	LOCATION	terms are made a great deal worse .

		The peace which now is being concluded here , in Brest-Litovsk , is not a peace based on free agree - ment of the people of
Russia	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	,
Austria-Hungary	LOCATION	,
Bulgaria	LOCATION	, and
Turkey	LOCATION	.

		It is a peace which is being dic - tated at the point of the gun .

		It is a peace which
Revolu	PERSON	- tionary
Russia	LOCATION	is compelled to accept with its teeth clenched .

		It is a peace which , under the pretext of `` liberation '' of the frontier districts of
Russia	LOCATION	, in reality turns them into German provinces , and denies them the right of free definition which was granted to them by the Workmen 's and Peasants ' Government of Revolutionary
Russia	LOCATION	.

		It is a peace which under the pretext of re - establishing order in these districts , gives armed assist - ance to the oppressing classes against the working class , and helps to put back on the laboring masses the yoke of oppression , which was thrown off by the Russian Revolu - tion .

		It is a peace which imposes , for a long time , on the laboring people of
Russia	LOCATION	the old commercial treaty of
1904	DATE	, which was made in the interests of the German agrarians , and which is now made even worse ; and at the same time it assures the payment of interest to the German and Austro-Hungarian bourgeoisie on the obli - gations of the
Czar 's Government	ORGANIZATION	, which were repudiated by Revolutionary
Russia	LOCATION	.

		Finally , as if to emphasize clearly the real class character of the German armed raid , the German ultimatum attempts to stop the mouth of the Russian Revolution by prohibiting agitation di - rected against the governments of the
Quadruple Alliance	ORGANIZATION	and their military authorities .

		But not only all that .

		Under the same pretext of re - establishing order ,
Germany	LOCATION	by force of arms occupies districts with a pure Russian population and establishes there a regime of military occupation and a return to the pre-Revolutionary order .

		In the
Ukraine	LOCATION	and in
Finland Germany	LOCATION	demands the non-interference of Revolutionary
Russia	LOCATION	, and at the same time actively assists the counter - Revolutionary forces against Revolutionary workmen and peasants .

		In the
Caucasus	LOCATION	, in direct violation of the terms formulated by
Germany	LOCATION	itself in the ultimatum of
February 21	DATE	,
Germany	LOCATION	tears away for the benefit of
Turkey	LOCATION	the districts of Ardaghan ,
Karse	PERSON	, and Batume , which were not conquered even once by the Turkish armies , without any consideration whatsoever of the real will of the population of these districts .

		The most brazen forcible annexational seizures and possession of the most important strategic points , which can have only one purpose ; the preparation of further invasion of
Russia	LOCATION	; and the defense of the capitalistic interests against the workmen 's and peasants ' revolution these are the real aims that are served by the offensive of the German troops , undertaken on the eighteenth of
February	DATE	, without the seven days ' notice which was assured by the armistice treaty made between
Russia	LOCATION	and the powers of the
Quadruple Alliance	ORGANIZATION	on the fifteenth of
December 1917	DATE	.

		This invasion was not stopped , in spite of the statement of the
Council of People	ORGANIZATION	's Commissaires of its acceptance of terms formulated in the German ultimatum of Feb - ruary 21 .

		This invasion was not stopped , in spite of the resumption of the work of the
Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	in Brest-Litovsk and in spite of the official protest of the Russian Delegation .

		By all this all the peace terms offered by
Germany	LOCATION	and her allies are reduced entirely to an ultimatum presented to
Russia	LOCATION	and supported from the side of the framers of this peace treaty by threat of direct armed violence .

		But in the created situation
Russia	LOCATION	has no possibility of choice .

		By demobilizing its armies the Russian Revolu - tion had placed its fate in the hands of the German people .

		The Russian Delegation in Brest-Litovsk had openly stated , in due time , that not a single honest man would believe that a war against
Russia	LOCATION	now might be a defen - sive war .


Germany	LOCATION	has undertaken the offensive .

		Under the slogan of establishing order , but in reality for the pur - poses of strangling the Russian Workmen 's and Peasants ' Revolution in the interests of the world 's imperialism , German militarism has now succeeded in moving its troops against the workingmen and peasant masses of the Russian Socialist Republic .

		The German proletariat has not as yet proved to be sufficiently strong to stop this attack .

		We do not doubt for a single minute that this triumph of imperialism and militarism over the interna - tional proletarian revolution will prove to be only tem - porary and transitive .

		Under the present conditions the Soviet Government of the Russian Republic , which is left only to its own re - sources , can not resist the armed offensive of German imperialism , and in the name of the preservation of
Revolutionary Russia	LOCATION	is compelled to accept the demands presented to it .

		We are authorized by our Government to sign the peace treaty .

		Compelled , in spite of our protest , to carry on negotiations under the very exceptional conditions of continuing military operations , which are not meeting with resistance from the Russian side , we can not subject to any further butchery the Russian workmen and peas - ants , who have refused to continue the war any longer .

		We openly state before the face of workmen , peasants , and soldiers of
Russia	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	, before the face of the laboring and exploited classes of the whole world , that we are compelled to accept the ultimatum dictated by the side which is at the present time more powerful , and are signing immediately the ultimative peace treaty presented to us , desisting from any deliberation upon it whatsoever .

		It was in the same tenor that the Soviet Govern - ment later welcomed to
Russia	LOCATION	the first - German Ambassador under the new treaty .

		We quote from the Russian newspaper Izvestia of
April 27	DATE	: The official reply of the Soviet Government of
Russia	LOCATION	to the greetings from the German Imperial Chancellor ,
Count Hertling	PERSON	, upon the presentation of credentials by the German Ambassador to
Moscow	LOCATION	,
Count Mirbach	PERSON	, to the representatives of the Soviet Government .

		This reply was read to the German ambassador by
Soverdlor	PERSON	, the chairman of the
All Russian Central Executive Committee of Soviets	ORGANIZATION	, in the
Kremlin	ORGANIZATION	on
April 26 , 1918	DATE	: `` In the name of the Russian Socialist Federated Soviet Republic I have the honor to greet in you , Mr.
Ambas	PERSON	- ^ sador , the representative of the power with which was concluded the peace treaty of
Brest	LOCATION	, as a result of which there was established between the two countries the peace
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 43 which was so essential to the people .

		All the obstacles to this peace must be removed .

		For this purpose our Com - missariat of
Foreign Affairs	ORGANIZATION	has today sent a note to the German Government a copy of which was handed to you , Mr. Ambassador the purpose of which is to remove all those dangers which threaten peace .

		`` I permit myself to express the hope that you , Mr.
Am	PERSON	- bassador , will , from your side , make all the necessary efforts for the satisfactory settlement of the problem and the securing of peace between the
German Government	ORGANIZATION	and the
Soviet Republic	LOCATION	. ''

		THE NEW STATESMAN ON THE SOVIETS The opposition of English liberal opinion to mili - tary intervention in
Russia	LOCATION	, as reported in this col - umn two weeks ago , is further manifested in the New Statesman .

		For more than a year that Liberal weekly has been consistently anti-Bolshevik .

		Now , in its issue of
December 21	DATE	, it prints an article as - serting that the
Bolsheviki	PERSON	are the real restorers of order in
Russia	LOCATION	: Order is more thoroughly reestablished in
Russia	LOCATION	now than at any time since the fall of Czardom .

		Food dis - tribution is better organized than at any time during the whole war .

		Factories are rapidly starting up again , as fast as raw material can be obtained .

		Management of the factories by committees failed , for obvious reasons .

		Management by the Soviets , with consultative committees of employees , has been substituted with growing success .

		The Bolsheviki , though hampered by undesirable tools , are cleaning the country of bribery and corruption .

		`` Terror '' has ceased .

		It has been greatly exaggerated .

		If
Nikolai Lenine	PERSON	had not been in bed , as the result of a wound , there would have been no `` terror '' in
Moscow	LOCATION	.

		There has been no execution in
Moscow	LOCATION	for two months .

		During the `` terror '' there were 400 executions , of which 60 per cent were corrupt Soviet officials .

		Inefficiency is being remedied by rapid recruiting from the educated classes .

		The Red army has become a real disciplined force , with a new spirit of revolutionary and nationalistic enthusiasm .

		Its numbers are uncertain , but there are at least 600,000 men in its ranks .

		It has rifles , machine guns and am - munition in plenty , but little artillery .

		No Russian army has a chance against it .

		It has experienced nothing but success since
September	DATE	.

		Great masses of professional men and petty bourgeoisie have gone over to the
Bolshe	LOCATION	- viki during the past few months .

		In the large towns , the workmen almost unanimously support the
Bolsheviki	LOCATION	.

		The peasants were hostile for a long time , but the forma - tion of `` poverty committees '' and the administration of the affairs of every village in the interests of the peasants has resulted in a great majority now keenly supporting
Lenine	PERSON	.

		The invading British army , which six months ago would have found many friends , Tiow finds only a very few .

		These are mostly property owners .

		Where the
White Guards	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- anti-Bolsheviki -RRB- temporarily occupied districts , they have carried out `` terrors '' on a scale the Red Guards never dreamed of .

		Any government estab - lished by us will need the support of foreign bayonets , as the Russian proletariat are thoroughly imbued with
Bol	PERSON	- shevism .

		The Bolsheviki would be certain to get a majority in a constituent assembly , but they prefer a Soviet govern - ment .

		This is frankly class rule , in which property owners have no voice until they become proletarians , but , as a majority rule , it is broader than ours was before the last reform act .

		Communications ALLIED RUBLES SIR : It is reported that
Great Britain	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	are issuing their own rubles in
Russia	LOCATION	.


Washington	LOCATION	, too , is reported to be paying attention to the same subject and to contemplate issuing American rubles in
Russia	LOCATION	.

		This fundamental question arises : if the Allied governments are imbued with the desire to render financial aid to
Russia	LOCATION	, and , if to their mind the best remedy is to inflate
Russia	LOCATION	with new paper rubles , why do th * ey not issue consolidated notes , guaranteed by all the Allied governments together ?

		In abstaining from answering the rhetorical ques - tion put above , let us emphasize with all possible vigor that the issuing of rubles by foreign govern - ments no matter what motives are leading them to such a measure can be considered only as the clearest kind of violation of Russian sovereignty .

		It is absolutely inconsistent with the principle of self - determination of nations .

		The right of issuing cur - rency notes or allowing similar issues is the most sacred right of every nation and should be violated under no circumstances .

		Only the nation itself , under emergency , can alienate this right .

		Let us consider the probable consequences of this issuing of rubles by foreign governments .

		Like the financial systems of all other belligerent governments except the
United States	LOCATION	, the financial system of
Russia	LOCATION	is very much disturbed the in - evitable disturbance due to the terrible economic burden laid upon the shoulders of
Russia	LOCATION	during the war .

		The paper inflation of
Russia	LOCATION	amounts to at least forty billion rubles , supported by a gold reserve of about
one billion rubles	MONEY	.

		It ought to be self-evi - dent that the inflation of Russian currency with Japanese , English , and American paper rubles can have only one result the further destruction of
Russia	LOCATION	's financial system .

		Now the English government is insuring the con - vertibility of its rubles into sterling at a rate of exchange of forty rubles to one pound , that is , about \ 2 l /
2 cents	MONEY	.

		-LRB- From the newspaper report it is not clear whether the exchange of notes is insured in gold or paper sterling . -RRB-

		Such a rat of exchange is much lower than the real exchange rate of Russian currency on the
New York Stock Exchange	ORGANIZATION	today : about
18 cents	MONEY	.

		It is needless to point out that with the conclusion of the armistice , with the growing possibility of export of raw materials from
Russia	LOCATION	and the growing need of the Allied governments for Russian rubles to maintain their armies now occupy - ing Russian territory , the exchange rate of the Rus - sian ruble , other things being equal , should show a rising tendency .

		We saw indeed that the exchange rate of Russian currency in
New York	LOCATION	gradually increased from
8 cents	MONEY	to 25 in the middle of No - vember and onlv from that date doubtless in con -
44	DATE	-
January	DATE	n nection with the rumors of the intention of the Allied governments to issue their own rubles in
Russia	LOCATION	did this tendency stop .

		Thereafter the rate of the Russian ruble began to fall .

		Evidently it will become lower , the more Japanese , English , and American rubles are issued .

		But the financial consequences of the measure are today only of subordinate importance .

		The eco - nomic consequences are vital .


Russia	LOCATION	needs economic help ; she needs foodstuffs , clothing , tools , farm machinery , and so on .

		She needs economic goods .

		She can not afford to supply with her own goods the Allied armies now occupying her territory and to export her materials into Allied countries without receiving an equivalent in real goods instead of in paper money .

		In issuing their own rubles the Allied governments are issuing a loan on the Russian market , a loan which does not bear any interest .

		The Allied governments are pay - ing for the materials , goods , and services they are getting from the Russian people , not with real goods but with obligations no matter what they are called nor how well their convertibility is insured .

		In - stead of rendering economic help to
Russia	LOCATION	, the in - flation of the Russian market with Japanese , Eng - lish , and American rubles has the tendency , on the contrary , of getting economic help from
Russia	LOCATION	.

		It is thinly disguised exploitation .

		Of course a minority of wealthy Russians are in - terested in such `` help '' because it will give them the possibility of exporting their capital from
Russia	LOCATION	into foreign countries and thus of escaping heavy taxation , which they are certain to experience from a democratic
Russia	LOCATION	.

		A second question arises : How is it possible to bring into existence any commercial intercourse with
Russia	LOCATION	without Russian currency having a stabilized value ?

		Before answering this question , we ought to emphasize that for the time being the only desirable commercial intercourse with
Russia	LOCATION	is that which gives her the goods she now so sadly needs .

		But the fact is , the policy of the Allied governments has the effect of exporting goods from
Russia	LOCATION	without the importing of equivalent real goods .

		The materials which can be exported from
Russia	LOCATION	should be paid for with an equivalent quantity of real goods im - ported from abroad .

		The services which the Rus - sian people are actually rendering to the Allied ar - mies now occupying
Russia	LOCATION	should also be paid for in equivalent real goods .

		The Russian ruble is the only legitimate form of Russian currency .

		It should be the only one .

		Under no circumstances are foreign governments en - titled to issue their own rubles on Russian soil .


Pri	ORGANIZATION	- vate corporations which today intend to have com - mercial intercourse with
Russia	LOCATION	ought to secure the rubles necessary for purchasing materials in
Russia	LOCATION	for export through import of goods needed in Rus - sia and through the selling of these goods to the Russian population for Russian rubles .

		In a word , the Allied governments ought to pay the Russian population for services and materials rendered to their armies with real goods which the Russian popu - lation needs .

		If the Allied governments are really willing to render help to
Russia	LOCATION	, they ought to do it in a straightforward way by importing real goods into
Russia	LOCATION	.

		Of course such a form of help is more risky and more complicated than the issuing of rubles a measure designed not to render genuine eco - nomic help to
Russia	LOCATION	but to get economic help from

New York City	LOCATION	.

		THE DIGNITY OF LABOR SIR : According to various dispatches received in
America	LOCATION	, it is a foregone conclusion that all efforts to establish democracies in
Europe	LOCATION	are doomed to failure .

		But , considering the plutocratic sources from which these reports are emanating , it at once becomes apparent that the `` wish is father to the thought . ''

		The principal ground upon which these reports are founded seems to consist in the fact that the leaders of the different provisional governments are men who once upon a time performed human labor actually worked and produced something .

		One was once a saddle-maker , another an electrical worker , another an agriculturist , and another just an editor like
Horace Greeley	PERSON	.

		What impresses one as peculiarly strange is the fact that many American newspapers profess to re - gard these objections as valid and logical reasons ; why any government under such leadership is neces - sarily unstable and transitory .

		But there are many shining examples in American history to prove the senselessness of such a contention .

		The attempt thus ; to belittle the new democratic leaders of
Europe	LOCATION	in the public mind is paralleled by the experiences of other noted men who have labored in the cause of democracy and the rights of man .

		At the time of the American Revolution
George Washington	PERSON	was denounced in
Europe	LOCATION	as a `` rebel against constituted authority . ''

		To discredit Wash - ington he was sneeringly referred to as a `` lowly agrarian . ''

		His armies were characterized as a `` rabble composed of the lowest elements , principally ex-convicts from the British colonies . ''

		No man ever bra \* d more bitter vituperation and slander than did
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	in the sixties .

		In Eastern newspapers he was caricatured in the most vulgar and shameless manner .

		In tne same spirit of malignity that marks the attacks being made upon his prototypes in
Europe	LOCATION	today Lincoln was anathe - matized as an `` untutored rail-splitter from the back - woods . ''

		But one spee ` ch at
Gettysburg	LOCATION	was sufficient to refute all the unjust imputations made against the dignity and scholarship of
Lincoln	LOCATION	.

		Another great man whom history will record as one of
America	LOCATION	's most illustrious citizens was Henry
1919	DATE	THE DIAL
George	PERSON	, author of the unanswerable treatise on political economy , Progress and Poverty .

		Col - lege professors , editors , and other paid apologists of institutions founded on special privilege vainly en - deavored to explain away the masterly arguments contained in the works of
George	LOCATION	.

		Failing in this , it has been the practice of his critics to resort to satire and ridicule .

		But the worst that mediocre minds could ever charge against
Henry George	PERSON	was the fact that he was once an `` itinerant printer , '' thus placing him in the same company with
Ben	PERSON	- jamin
Franklin	PERSON	, who , tired and footsore , trudged into
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		If the doctrines advocated by
Henry George	PERSON	were now a law of the land , one would not witness the spectacle of statesmen at
Washington	LOCATION	devising plans to reward soldiers with swamps and boglands for their heroic services in destroying militarism in
Europe	LOCATION	, whilst vast areas of fertile fields , already productive , are held out of use by speculators in land .


Robert Ingersoll	PERSON	in his efforts to disprove the historicity of Christ never once disparaged the Ser - mon on the Mount because its author was a car - penter .

		This one example should impress everyone with a reverence for the dignity of labor .

		FREEDOM OF THE SEAS SIR : In your issue of
December 14	DATE	, page 563 , you comment on
Churchill	ORGANIZATION	's `` commendable bluntness '' in voicing
Wilson	PERSON	's `` fourth point . ''

		I wonder whether Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	's motives in the matter are as commendable as his bluntness .

		I have not seen any attempted explanation .

		Is it not strange , how - ever , that a Government so anxious for the disarma - ment of land forces shows an equal anxiety lest the same policy be followed as regards naval power ?

		Possibly the matter is not so profound , considering that the Power in question is the leading naval na - tion , and is determined that the same mistake be not made again .

		It is highly expedient that one armed only with a knife , when others carry rifles , add a rifle to his wardrobe .

		Under such circum - stances it is highly discreet to demand that all rifles , including your own , be declared out of fashion especially when you have , in the meantime , cornered the market on knives .

		HUMANITY IN THE UNIVERSITY SIR : In the will of othe late
Willard Straight	ORGANIZATION	there was an expression which promises to become classic .

		He asked that some money be left to
Cornell University	ORGANIZATION	to make the place `` more human . ''

		Upon these terms he might have left a legacy to almost every one of our universities .

		They teach the humanities and practice the most mechanistic con - ception of life and living .

		They are vast combina - tions of trackless miles covered with buildings and scientific paraphernalia .

		They enroll tens of thou - sands of students .

		They employ formidable staffs of instruction .

		They turn out competent doctors and mechanics and lawyers .

		But they fail in molding character .

		They do not expose their students to the finest that has been said , thexhighest that has been thought , the noblest that has been written .

		They make efficiency their goal , and a vain triviality is their reward .

		The best known and equally the best beloved of
Cornell	ORGANIZATION	's younger alumni came back from the grave to utter this plea for a greater humanity .

		He left the execution of his wish to those who have survived the war .

		The word has been spoken and there are many ears that have caught its deeper meaning .

		RANDOLPH BOURNE SIR : Long before I had met
Randolph Bourne	PERSON	I seemed to divine from the tenor of his writing that he was one of those extraordinarily fine-grained men that one meets but rarely in a lifetime and that it is always an exceptional privilege to know .

		It re - quired only a little sympathetic insight to feel that his occasional `` bitterness '' was in reality but the keen edge of a remorseless sincerity and that he would have been as eager to cut and change his own soul with it as anyone else 's .

		His extraordinary combination of the will to see things as they are with a warmth of idealism -LRB- not the phrase-making kind -RRB- still haunts me as something particularly inspiring .

		What I most liked , however , about
Bourne	PERSON	was hjs exquisite sensibility to the esthetic in literature , to the nuances of thought and feeling and expression .

		One knew instinctively that if anything passed by him with his approval or sympathy , it was indeed something genuine .

		His own style was well-nigh perfect .

		Often clever , he was too sensitive ever to be merely clever .

		I imagine him shrinking from vulgarity of any kind as one shrinks from a disgust - ing bug .

		His loss will be keenly felt not only by THE DIAL but by all who know how to appreciate a soul at once sensitive and remorselessly strong .

January 11	DATE	Notes on New Books THE MARNE .

		By
Edith Wharton	PERSON	.

		Appleton ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	's
Marne	ORGANIZATION	is in no sense a navigable stream for the deeper emotions .

		One can not stifle the feeling that , were it not for the title and the times , it would stand no higher than many another piece of opportunist fiction .

		Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	's story in its framework a sort of double exposure of the great battleground is centered upon interpret - ing the emotional experience of a serious-minded , France-loving American youth , impelled to action despite the clogged complacency of his wealthy en - vironment .

		But the artist has been subordinated to the propagandist , until at intervals the author lapses into employing the well-thumbed counters of jour - nalistic commonplace : The
Lusitania	LOCATION	showed
America	LOCATION	what the Germans were ,
Plattsburg	LOCATION	tried to show her the only way of dealing with them .

		There had never been anything worth while in the world that had not had to be died for , and it was as clear as day that a world which no one would die for could never be a world worth being alive in .

		The early pages sketch those superficial impulses of war charity the bazaars and tableaux and dances , `` keeping up a kind of continuous picnic on the ruins of civilization '' and here the touch is more genuine .

		Later the story stumbles into sym - bolism , with the author standing stanchly at the bellows lest the flame die out .

		In the range of Wharton fiction here is one novel which must be classed among the `` seconds . ''

		BENJAMIN FRANKLIN SELF-REVEALED .

		By
William Cabell Bruce	PERSON	.

		2 vols .

		Putnam ;
$ 6	MONEY	.

		A brilliant English writer has recently bewailed the low state into which the art of biography has fallen .

		`` Those two fat volumes , '' he says , `` with which it is our custom to commemorate the dead who does not know them , with their ill-digested masses of material , their slipshod style , their tone of tedious panegyric , their lamentable lack of selec - tion , of detachment , of design ? ''

		Mr.
Bruce	PERSON	's biography of Franklin might almost have been writ - ten to illustrate this sentence .

		The author has col - lected a mass of facts from
Franklin	PERSON	's own journals , letters , writings , .

		and tumbled it into loose chapters , which have won for him from an amiable university a prize for the best American biography of the year .

		The book tells a great many interesting things about that shrewd and able pagan who bequeathed to
America	LOCATION	a scale of bourgeois virtues about which he himself must always more or less have had his tongue in his cheek .

		Mr.
Bruce	PERSON	's own atitude is a con - tribution .

		He spends much time in regretting that so excellent a man should have been so much sub - ject , even in advanced age , to the frailties of the flesh .

		We learn therefore more about
Franklin	PERSON	's private life than is customary in American pictures of the admirable sage .

		His biographer stands par - ticularly aghast at
Franklin	PERSON	's insensitiveness to `` the finer feelings of mankind , '' in his treatment of both his legitimate and illegitimate children with the same tenderness and affection .

		This `` ingenious natural - ism , '' says our self-revealing biographer , was so unblushing and persistent as almost to have a certain `` bastard moral value of its own . ''

		One can see how very entertaining a study of a human life in such terms could be .

		THE POETS OF MODERN
FRANCE	LOCATION	.

		By Lud - wig
Lewisohn	PERSON	.

		Huebsch ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		A more appropriate title for these translations would have been The Symbolistic Poets of
France	LOCATION	.

		For while the Belgians Rodenbach ,
Maeterlinck	PERSON	, and
Verhaeren	PERSON	are externally French , Mr.
Lewisohn	PERSON	deals almost entirely with the generation of the
last quarter of the nineteenth century	DATE	and fails to in - clude
Claudel	PERSON	or
Peguy	PERSON	or the riotous band of `` imagists '' so dear to the modern poetic heart .

		Within these limits , however , he shows both insight and talent .

		There is an interesting if somewhat footless essay on the symbolistic movement , which would have gained force by connecting the school more definitely with the Romantic expansionism of the century , and by emphasizing that , as a piece of technique , connotation through the deft use of com - monplace words plays the great part in symbolistic art .

		This is followed by the sixty translations from the chief authors and a bibliography of their main works .

		The translator , alive to the peculiar difficulty of reproducing in English the rhythms and subtleties of the French , succeeds best with
Verlaine	PERSON	, Ver - haeren , and the princely
Regnier	PERSON	.

		The greatest of these , in fact of the entire group , is of course Ver - haeren ; and Mr.
Lewisohn	PERSON	's rendering of The Mill conveys well the Flemish poet 's landscape and his tortured sense of uttering the inutterable .

		Again in such a selection as
Kahn	PERSON	's O bel Awil epanoui -LRB- O lovely
April	DATE	rich and bright -RRB- he has caught the spirit as well as the movement of the original .

		One regrets that this is not more often the case .

		`` On the loud room falls silence like a trance '' hardly renders
Samain	PERSON	's luminous Alexandrine -LRB- the poem portrays a `` dance '' Dans la salle en rumeur un silence a passe -RCB- ; whereas the poignant climax of
Fernand Gregh	PERSON	's Mon Dieu qui nes peut-etre pas simply defies translation : certainly `` Thee who , per - haps , art not at all '' comes nowhere near it .

		But let us not ask the impossible .

		The little volume will win readers for the French Symbolists .

		That is its great merit .

		A translation , even the best , is mainly an interpretation ; and Mr.
Lewisohn	PERSON	's interpretations are decidedly worth while .

		1919 THE DIAL 47 THE ROMANCE OF OLD
PHILADELPHIA	LOCATION	.

		By
John T. Faris	PERSON	.

		Lippincott ;
$ 4.50	MONEY	.

		Romance the romance of daring the unknown , the romance of unique experience , the even greater romance of simple daily life all these Mr.
Faris	PERSON	offers us .

		He cunningly takes us x on a trip of the imagination to a land made tangible by countless realistic details .

		We make again that delightful dis - covery that life is more strange and romantic than fiction as we read of English heirs being shanghaied and sold to slavery , of the trials and adventures of travel more impossible than Crusoe 's , of
Philadel	LOCATION	- phia 's cave-dwellers riot Indians but English pio - neers .

		And these are tales garnered in Mr.
Faris	PERSON	' painstaking research among old letters and other documents , so that they are as authentic as they are interesting .

		No dead bones dry as dust here , but living figures a colorful pageant of early
Phila	LOCATION	- delphia life .

		Through understanding how human beings gain experience , or by virtue of native literary ability , the author has known how to make us really ac - quainted with the city 's beginnings , and because of this moving presentation of life the book becomes literature , which too few guidebooks are .

		Yet the literary quality subtracts not one iota from the au - thenticity and comprehensiveness of the account .

		The author 's cast of mind permits him to select with unerring judgment and no little humor those incidents which are not only most characteristic of the city 's pioneer life but also most full of human interest .

		No doubt some of his brave success can be attributed to the natural richness of the subject and the plentitude of its resources for the historian :
Philadelphia	LOCATION	has a past as romantically quaint and as historically important as any large American city , and she has shown a smiling pride in her be - ginnings by a wise preservation of records .

		But , no matter how preserved , records are only records until they fall under the eye of an imagination competent to re-create the romance of reality . '

GABRIELLE DE BERGERAC	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Henry James	PERSON	.

		Penguin Series .


Boni & Liveright	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		Had
Henry James	PERSON	pursued the vein of this early story he might have become a novelist of insurgence .

		For misalliance is the theme to which he cleaves and his setting is the period just preceding the French Revolution , swept by Rousseauism .

		Co - quelin , servant-preceptor in the house of the
Baron de Bergerac	PERSON	, is made to win the
Baron	PERSON	's sister , and is permitted by the novelist to indulge in reflections that do honor to the age-long struggle of man against institutions .

		However , the young lady 's baronial brother is properly overbearing and her rejected noble suitor cynical to the right degree and fore - spent .

		Henry
James	PERSON	' insurgence even here has an urbanity and elegance which is made manifest in the style of his writing .

		The language of passion that passes between
Coquelin	PERSON	and his high-born but impoverished Mile , de Bergerac might have graced any polished novel or comedy of manners .

		True , the narrative is from the lips of the baron 's son , but this is a novelist 's self-justification .

		One feels wit , the story-tellers ' iron sense of his art 's proprie - ties , guarding reckless human passion .

		It is a well - proportioned , graceful , and pungently written little story , showing some study of the period which it represents .

		But besides its insurgence there is an earnest in it of
Henry James	PERSON	' later exploration of the English scene , a jungle whose lions often turned out in his hands to be toy rabbits .

		HIRA SINGH .

		By
Talbot Mundy	PERSON	.

		Bobbs -
Merrill	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		In the
spring of 1915	DATE	some two hundred Sikh troops were captured in Flanders by the Germans and sent to
Turkey	LOCATION	in the hope that they would join the Turks .

		They escaped and marched to Ka - bul in
Afghanistan	LOCATION	in four months , and thus re - joined the fighting forces .


Elmer Davis	PERSON	put Captain
Talbot Mundy	PERSON	, author of King of the Khybor Rifles , in touch with these men , and he has con - structed a story of their wanderings by sea and through the mountains of Kurdistan which he tells in the first person as
Hira Singh	PERSON	, bahadur of the Sikh cavalry .

		It is a method which allowed Cap - tain
Mundy	PERSON	a chance for as much vividness as De - foe 's Captain
Singleton	PERSON	, without tying him down to specific detail of routes and dates , and yet there is enough fact underlying the story to keep
Hira Singh	PERSON	from resembling the
G. A. Henty	PERSON	type of hero
Captain Mundy	ORGANIZATION	has formerly depicted .

		The narrative rivals in interest the march of the Ten Thousand Greeks ; and the Oriental craft of the ne - gotiations between the Sikh leader and the Turks reminds one of wily Xenophon bartering with tricky Tissaphernes in this same region .

		Of course the Armenian atrocities and the dire plottings of Ger - many in the East are dragged in , but so cleverly as to become an integral element of the story .

		Captain
Mundy	PERSON	has an intimate and sympathetic knowledge of the
Sikh	ORGANIZATION	as a faithful soldier of the British raj and a loyal ally of the Englishman , but he shows essentially the same Sikh Kipling shows plus initiative and intelligence .

		His use of local color in external details is felicitous , and his com - ments on events and places from the Sikh point of view are in character .

		Unfortunately he slights the religious and truly Oriental aspects of the Sikh which make him the splendid fighter that he is , and he does not allude to some of the most obvious customs of this material people .

		For instance , he tells us that the name Singh means lion , but he does not state that all male Sikhs bear it by the order of one of the Gurus , because it was a name belonging to the warrior caste and all Sikhs were supposed to be equals and fighters .

		He makes no allusion to the khalsa of the Singh , five items of dress which make for military efficiency : a heavy turban , THE DIAL
January 1 1	DATE	long hair and beard , a steel bracelet these to ward off sword cuts short drawers for quickness of movement , in distinction from the cumbrous Mo - hammedan and Hindu garb , and a sword , which must always be worn by the true Sikh .

		This last item is so important that a Sikh professor from the college at Amhitzar who did not care to wear a sword openly while studying in
America	LOCATION	, always carried a sword cane with him .

		THE ENGLISH MIDDLE CLASS .

		By
R. H. Gretton	PERSON	.

		Macmillan ;
$ 3.50	MONEY	.

		Mr.
Gretton	PERSON	's book is an attempt to define the meaning and significance of the `` middle class '' in
England	LOCATION	.

		With clearness , judgment , and a sense of proportion the author maintains the hypothesis that `` the middle class is that portion of the com - munity to which money is the primary condition and the primary instrument of life . ''

		In the opinion of the reviewer , the historical evidence presented fully justifies Mr.
Gretton	PERSON	's contention .

		With this beginning , it is most desirable that the author should proceed to make a great comparative study of the same development wherever else it may have taken place .

		For the Continent the materials are readily available , as the author very Veil knows , but what should be urged upon his attention is that a theory of this importance must be tested in the light of all the evidence available .

		What one does , in fact , is to ask Mr.
Gretton	PERSON	to put himself in the very forefront of the emerging generation of scholars whose point of departure is a devotion to the study of man rather than an academic interest in the study of documents .

		For this subject is of absolutely fundamental importance to our compre - hension of modern life .

		Political society begins everywhere in individual self-assertion based upon ownership of land .

		The next step forward comes only with the discovery , on the part of a new order in society , of a second possible basis of self-asser - tion namely , money and this discovery dates , for practical purposes , only from the sixteenth century .

		Today we are witnessing the blind , driving efforts of still another level of society to achieve the same end .

		Let us clearly grasp the fact that the most important task of today is to understand man .

		Mr.
Gretton	PERSON	's contribution to this task is one to read , remember , and respect .

		ROUMANIA : YESTERDAY AND TODAY .

		By Mrs.
Will Gordon	PERSON	.

		Introduction and two chapters by the Queen of
Roumania	LOCATION	.

		Lane ;
$ 3	MONEY	.

		The reader of this book may gather , without much trouble , a fairly adequate idea of the backgrounds of Roumanian culture and history , as well as a knowledge of the peculiar part the country played in the war .

		Mrs.
Gordon	PERSON	has a keen sense of the picturesque and an ardent sympathy with the people whom she describes .

		At times however she is guilty of the flowery writing that some readers dislike to associate with historical accounts .

		The pages con - tributed by
Queen Marie	PERSON	are also written in a rhapsodic style , and in some cases are really ex - amples of prose poetry , welling up in the heart of a ruler who has gone down among her people and ministered to .

		them without fear of plague or hard - ship .

		Queen
Marie	PERSON	's outlook nevertheless is some - what too centripetal ; she knows what her nation has suffered , for she has seen the devastation of land and body face to face ; yet for all this her emphasis is not upon the land and the people but upon her own suffering .

		For a moment , to be sure , the other side strikes her forcibly : Why should I be chosen to represent an ideal ?

		Why should just I be the symbol ?

		What right have I to stand above them , to buy glory with the shedding of their blood ?

		It is unfortunate that in a book whose ` sales will help to swell the
Roumania Relief Funds	ORGANIZATION	there should occur passages that seek to palliate Rou - mania 's attitude toward her Jews .

		It matters not whether the Jews of
Roumania	LOCATION	are racially akin to the Semites or not ; they are entitled to justice , no more and no less .

		And at this late date in soci - ological study , to speak of any type of people as `` intruders '' betrays not only a species of intolerance but need for a greater knowledge of the reasons behind the migratory movements of peoples .

		Despite these faults the volume repays reading ; it presents a succinct , colorful account , suggestive and stim - ulating .

		THE CAUSES AND COURSE OF ORGANIC EVO - LUTION : A Study in
Bioenergics	LOCATION	.

		By
John Muirhead Macfarlane	PERSON	.

		Macmillan ;
$ 4	MONEY	.

		From time to time our ears are assailed with lugubrious plaints to the effect that we are living in an age of overspecialization in which the sense for the meaning of the whole is utterly lost in the contemplation of detail .

		However justifiable such strictures may be in particular cases , they betray a startling ignorance of history and human psychol - ogy if they intend to suggest that the condition is a permanent and necessary one .

		For history shows in very decisive manner that the periods of patient col - lecting of facts are invariably followed by others of magnificent generalization , and the synthetic in - stinct in man is far too deep-rooted to be bullied into quiescence by no matter how imposing an array of raw data .

		Professor Macf arlane 's book is a good illustration of this tendency .

		It represents the thoroughly hon - est attempt of a veteran botanist to outline his per - sonal philosophy of the universe after presenting with much elaboration an account of biological evo - lution .

		The author expresses some interesting origi - nal views in contending that plants did not develop in the ocean but in fresh-water areas .

		Unfortunate -
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 49 ly for most readers , he does not mince technicalities and adds to the existing terminology some rather forbidding inventions of his own .

		The more gen - eral sections display a thoroughgoing humanitarian spirit and political liberalism not without a tincture of Christian theology .

		As a whole the book , with its flavor of the old-fashioned yet progressive spirit of noblesse obligeante , commands respect as a human document without ranking as a remarkable contribu - tion to thought . '

		ADVENTURES IN
INDIGENCE	LOCATION	.

		By
Laura Spen	PERSON	- cer Portor .


Atlantic Monthly Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		The imagined joys of vagrancy are .

		Sung best by those who who punch clocks ; the potency of poverty is the turgid theme of the well-to-do .

		It is neces - sary to be somewhat removed from certain states of existence to do them literary homage , just as
Steven	PERSON	- son probably wrote about idleness upon one of his busy days .

		Thus Adventures in Indigence will be - guile you , not as the reflection of a state in which you long to see yourself , but in a more aloof and vicarious way .

		You will enjoy its philosophy so long as you are comfortable in the knowledge that you need not practice it .

		To have known and yet to have loved the world !

		Is not this the real heart of the matter ?

		Is not this the true test after all , and the indisputable mark of a king 's son ?

		And shall you not find it oftener among the poor than elsewhere ?

		For he can not be said to know the world who has never been at its mercy ; even as only he can be said to have triumphed over it , who , having suffered all things at its hands , yet loves it with unconquerable fidelity .

		This is the theme about which the author has grouped her sketches , giving them a sympathetic and a graceful expression .

		A pleasant book , in a word , but not one which we should class among the in - dispensables for charity-hospital libraries .

		A rather palatable little book , though it does lack a pinch of salt .

		JOHN O'MAY .

		By
Maxwell Struthers Burt	ORGANIZATION	.

		Scribner ;
$ 1.35	MONEY	.

		Mr.
Burt	PERSON	's stories follow pretty closely the tradi - tion set by Mrs.
Gerould	PERSON	and Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	.

		It is from them he has learned that air of keen and lucid detachment from his characters , that air of unwillingness to be fooled either by them or by his theme .

		And he gets , too , a fine competence of phrase and a strong intellectual thread of plot that make the stories rather invigorating reading .

		He likes the gentleman adventurer who divides his life sharply between the luxurious modernity of the Fifth Avenue club and the blizzards of a
Wyoming	LOCATION	ranch or the heat of an
Arizona	LOCATION	desert .

		He likes the theme of the brilliant Briton who turns up in an Indian tepee , or of strong , restless young capitalists who come home to die at the hands of angry strikers .

		But his men are less complicated and therefore more convincing than the characters of those two women writers with whom , one inevitably associates him .


John O'May	PERSON	is perhaps the least effective of the stories , for it presents merely an adventurer who is not shown up .

		But Mr.
Burt	PERSON	makes up for his men in the mystical strangeness of his women .

		He loves the wistful , ill-mated woman found in a ranch or mining-camp of the Western wilderness .

		Wings of the
Morning	ORGANIZATION	, with its weird theme of the aeroplane , is a really beautiful picture of a woman 's uncon - scious life breaking through the hard bright sur - face .

		In the last story Mr.
Burt	PERSON	handles the familiar theme of the blind soldier with a very sure and powerful touch .

		Its climax of undeniable pathos concludes a most interesting book .

		STUDIES IN JAPANESE BUDDHISM .

		By
August Karl Reischauer	PERSON	.

		Macmillan ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		KOREAN BUDDHISM : History Condition Art .

		Three Lectures .

		By
Frederick Starr	PERSON	.

		Marshall Jones ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		All students of Buddhism and all who are inter - ested in the religions and philosophies of the Orient will welcome these two books as significant con - tributions to the study of one of the world 's three great living religions .

		In addition they may be expected to advance American understanding of the life and ideals of our nearest
Pacific	LOCATION	neigh - bors , of ever growing importance to us .

		For one is at once struck by the fact that both Professors ,
Reischauer	PERSON	and
Starr	PERSON	regard Buddhism as the one .

		really living native religion -LRB- for the
Mahayana	LOCATION	Buddhism is so Mongolized as to be essentially na - tive -RRB- and the one really formidable rival of
Chris	PERSON	- tianity .

		Indeed its encounters with Christianity have apparently reacted in the form of a veritable Buddhist renaissance , about which there is gather - ing , if not a nationalistic , at least a cultural con - sciousness ; for it must be remembered that the art and literary traditions of
Korea	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	, in their first impulse , came with Buddhism from
China	LOCATION	, and these traditional and esthetic elements are powerful fortifiers of conservatism and strong foundations for cultural revivals .

		`` The view that the religions of the Orient are one and all like tottering castles of antiquity which will soon crumble to dust , '' says Professor
Reischauer	PERSON	, `` betrays a rather shallow knowledge of the real nature of religion '' ; and , though himself a Christian missionary , he believes that it `` will take decades atid perhaps centuries '' to
Christianize Japan	LOCATION	.

		Similarly Professor
Starr	PERSON	, in his discussion of the condition of Korean Buddhism , finds absurd the statement of Dr.
Hulbert	PERSON	that `` Buddhism in
Korea	LOCATION	is dead '' ; instead he sketches the growth of a strong Buddhist revival , in which he even finds a covert nationalism resurgent : `` Korean Buddhism of today is actually Korean , not Japanese .

		I can imagine nothing that would be more danger - 5 THE DIAL
January 1 1	DATE	ous to Japanese control than a strong and vital Korean Buddhism that was hostile to
Japan	LOCATION	. ''

		In - deed it may not be beyond the bounds of possibility that the Japanese government may yet formally en - courage Christianity in both
Japan	LOCATION	and
Korea	LOCATION	in the interests of national unity .

		Both books are made up of lecture series .

		Pro- fessor
Reischauer	PERSON	's lectures were the seventh series on the
Deems Lectureship of New York University	ORGANIZATION	, where they were delivered in
1913	DATE	.

		The book itself however is a great expansion of the lectures , with valuable apparatus of notes and bibliography the latter being a survey list of the principal
Japan	LOCATION	- ese works .

		The plan of the seven lectures is : first , a survey of Buddhist origins in
India	LOCATION	and its spread through
China	LOCATION	; its history and assimilation in
Japan	LOCATION	, where Buddhism has become the true religion of the people , taking , so to speak , all that is vital in
Shinto	LOCATION	and Confucianism under its wing ; an analysis of the doctrines , sects , and ethics of Japanese Bud - dhism ; and finally a discussion of its prospects , which the lecturer naturally does not regard as hopeful , in rivalry with Christianity a program which is not only comprehensive but is presented with a detail for which the author 's round dozen of years as a teacher of philosophy in
Japan	LOCATION	have given him competency .

		Professor
Starr	PERSON	's three lectures have a different foundation .

		They are in fact traveler 's notes , based on several visits to
Korea	LOCATION	and laborious journeys to the Buddhist centers there ; but they happen to be the notes of a trained ethnologist and a sharp ob - server in , as he says , a `` virgin field . ''

		The book `` but scratches the surface '' of the subject : but it gives an introduction where there was none before ; it shows that the subject is one of a very living interest ; and the numerous half-tones from the author 's photographs -LRB- unfortunately none too well printed -RRB- afford a survey of Korean religious art whose rarity will reenforce its welcome .

		THE
VANGUARD OF AMERICAN VOLUNTEERS	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Edwin W. Morse	PERSON	.

$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		War puts a premium upon the services of the compiler .

		Men who have gone into the fighting doubly armed with sword and pen have not lacked for assistance in the task of placing their literary product in the hands of willing publishers .

		On the heels of the early collections of war verse and war prose came the outpourings of the cultists and con - trovertists , but these are rapidly being effaced by their own dust . '

		Mr.
Morse	PERSON	, fortunately , has re - frained from being anything more pretentious than a sympathetic compiler , intent upon presenting within the scope of one volume the essential facts concerning the early American fighters .

		Excerpts from letters , and from newspaper and magazine contributions comprise most of the book .

		Mr.
Morse	PERSON	's function has been to arrange the material in convenient divisions , and to link it with necessary explanatory paragraphs .

		He makes no attempt to weigh
Alan Seeger	PERSON	in the scales of definitive justice as an artist , nor to have a finger in the pie of con - troversy .

		This may be merely a negative virtue , but it is one which ought not be passed by in silence .

		WAR VERSE .

		Edited by
Frank Foxcroft	ORGANIZATION	.

		Crowell ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		This collection of war poems , unlike most , is worth its editor 's trouble .

		There should , of course , be a concession at the outset that the war will not as yet deliver much unalloyed and finished fairy gold .

		There will be poetry in time to come , since probably no epoch of history , not even the Na - poleonic , will have so many or so impressive asso - ciations as this ; the tense however is necessarily future .

		The war is still very present .

		Tranquillity is what we need , since memory is the parent of poetry ; and tranquillity is not at present in general - use .

		Mr.
Foxcroft	PERSON	's volume has its value , then , less as a collection of poems though there is a good deal of poetry in it than as a collection of elo - quence .

		Certain of the editor 's inclusions have gained note elsewhere :
Rupert Brooke	PERSON	's four best sonnets are here , and
Alan Seeger	PERSON	's Rendezvous with Death ; there is also
Eden Phillpotts	PERSON	' exquisite Death and the Flowers ;
Henry Newbolt	PERSON	is represented by Fare - well and the fine King 's Highway ;
Hilaire Belloc	ORGANIZATION	by Sedan ;
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	with Before Marching and After .

		These and a few others are perhaps the high points of the collection , though the good poems are by no means all followed by familiar names ; and if the collection shows nearly every degree and quality of ` execution , it nevertheless also holds throughout a considerable elevation and dig - nity .

		They are not quite the `` per - fect speech '' that Arnold predicates as poetry .

		But they are something that enthusiasm might con - ceivably urge as about as good ; they are eloquence eloquence which would undoubtedly be poetry but for a certain lack of the terms of expression .

		And , at that , one is not sure that such eloquence may not have a mark and moment equal to that of poetry of less , or even of the same , inspiration ; the reader will find himself very much held by such eloquence and moved much in the same fashion in which poetry proper moves him .

		But , like eloquence , pieces of this sort rather too much fall back on the locutions of custom used in untransmuted relations ; and like eloquence they rely for their power mainly on the momentum and energy or poignancy of their sub - stance .

		Poetry however is not poetry by virtue of its momentum , and everyone will concede that there is a great deal of energetic and poignant prose .

		The language of poetry may have and doubtless always should have the effect of simplicity ; but it surely is not simple .

		Accordingly , although
Christ	ORGANIZATION	in
Flanders	LOCATION	and In
Flanders Fields	ORGANIZATION	are fine and doubtless enduring things , they are not quite poet - ically absolute , since they are somewhat impoverished in the fit detail , the selective , rich specificity , the various and mysterious wealth of poetry .

		Yet if the majority of these pieces seem not en - tirely to achieve the spontaneous and coherent final - ity of poetry , it must certainly be marked that they are incoherent partly through their great burden of significance ; it is an incoherence of the stable and the steady , even the static , who are here deeply moved .

		It is an obviously English volume .

		It is English , too , at the time when the English are historically , proverbially , at their best in their hour of adversity .

		Its eloquence well reflects the pain endured , the matter-of-fact sacrifice , the renewal of faith , the patriotic stir of pulse , the good yew stead - iness of front which have characterized the British for the last four years .

		There will be more fin - ished poetry , and of greater reach and caliber , from this war ; yet it will be some ` time before the sin - cerity and national timbre of the English are more convincingly witnessed to than they are in these poems , whose language , if not quite verbally equal to the occasion , does yet give considerable breath again to the robust and resonant sentiments of that thoroughly English and very remarkable monarch ,

Josephine Daskam Bacon	PERSON	are among the most fortunate in heredity and environment , and there are in this book , no doubt , many suggestions ' as to education and development which their mother is generous in supplying to the unthinking ; but it is rather a pity that the memoirs of childhood should give the impression of an aerated text on the elements of pedagogy .

		Mrs.
Bacon	PERSON	's talents could be better employed than in presenting these excellent , but widely known , methods in child - training in this almost insufferably righteous way .

		The children in the book , fortunately , are real children , although surrounded by perfection .

		The illustrations conform to the text in their general fashion-magazine style .

		The title frankly sets the bounds of attainment in
James W. Foley	PERSON	's Friendly Rhymes -LRB- Button ;
$ 2	MONEY	-RRB- .

		The author does not aspire to rank higher than a rhymester , possibly on the theory that the man with three nickels in his pocket can make as much jingle as the man with three gold pieces .

		He writes on the philosophic level of the cartoonist 's embodiment of the ultimate consumer , occasionally throwing in some dialect , or something with its major appeal to the juvenile reader .

		The book is illustrated .

		A vertiginous baffling of the expectation comes over one who peruses
J. A. Faulkner	PERSON	's Wesley as Sociologist , Theologian and Churchman -LRB-
Abingdon	LOCATION	Press ; 75 cts . -RRB-

Wesley	PERSON	was not a sociologist , not a theologian , not a churchman . -RSB-

		But he was a fine type of religious organizer , a personality with a happy faculty of loving domination , and a tireless laborer for a bet - ter Church of
England	LOCATION	, a better nation , and a better humanity .

		Professor
Faulkner	PERSON	has presented a pen picture of Wesley that is authoritative and brief .

		Surely the essayist must re - gretfully have surrendered some pleasanter task to undertake this methodical mapping out of

Leicester House	ORGANIZATION	, which stood where
Daly	PERSON	's Theatre and its companion buildings now stand , and was originally the house of ... '' to the British Museum and

THK	ORGANIZATION	DIAL .

		THE DIAL A FORTNIGHTLY A Voice Out of
Russia	LOCATION	.

		/ AMERICANS have always pictured
Russia	LOCATION	as some fairyland such as
India	LOCATION	or
Tibet	LOCATION	.

		Formerly it was the land of the Czars , the whip , and the
Cossack	ORGANIZATION	, and now it is the land of the still less comprehensible
Bolsheviki	PERSON	.

		Yet there is a great likeness in char - acter between Americans and Russians : for instance , devotion to land , love of liberty , natural humor , and a carefree attitude .

		But there is a great dif - ference , owing to historic reasons , between the mode of life of the
United States	LOCATION	and that of
Russia	LOCATION	.

		First of all , the white pioneers went into the forests and prairies of this country one by one or in small groups and settled immediately as individual farmers .

		The Russian people migrated a thousand years ago from the Carpathians to the east en masse .

		They occupied lands for `` artels '' -LRB- groups -RRB- .

		During that thousand years they grew accustomed to cultivating the land by communistic methods .

		But the
Ameri	PERSON	- can farmer is first of all an owner , whereas the Russian peasant is a communist and here lies the reason of the success of Socialistic teaching in Rus - sia .

		Second , in
America	LOCATION	material and spiritual advantages are distributed among the population more evenly than in
Russia	LOCATION	.

		Until the very out - break of the Revolution the law distinctly divided the Russian `` subjects '' into two uneven parts : 3 per cent of the population were the so-called `` priv - ileged '' classes and 97 per cent the so-called `` tax - paying '' people .

		All comforts and necessities of life , including education , were the privilege of the 3 per cent ; admittance to high schools and universi - ties , to state service and officers ' rank was totally closed to the 97 per cent .

		It should not be for - gotten that 85 per cent of the population were freed from the state of slavery only
fifty-eight years ago	DATE	, and naturally they still bear much malice to their former masters .

		But even among the
3 per cent	MONEY	of the privileged there was not full content ; the capitalistic class and the
Intelligentsia	LOCATION	were de - r prived of political power , which was monopolized by court adventurers .

		Discontent was universal .

		It was already evident in
1905	DATE	, but not being suffici - ently organized , it was crushed .

		The war precipitated the climax .

		It is well known that the war found
Russia	LOCATION	inadequately prepared .

		Nevertheless we performed the self - imposed duties more than honestly ; we performed them with self-sacrifice .

		And this did not fail to react ; owing to the undeveloped state of our eco - nomic life we were ruined by hunger and poverty by the third year of the war .

		This did not happen at once .

		We passed three stages in falling down the slope .

		The first stage passed with the cry : `` The war will end soon ! ''

		Owing to this belief the factories and shops con - tinued to work according to the usual peace pro- gram and met the demands of the consumers at the expense of the army 's needs .


Russia	LOCATION	had everything in abundance ; moreover the cessation of exports created a surplus of goods .

		The heart of the country did not feel the hardships of the war .

		It is true that 12,000,000 youths and men were torn away from their families , but the tears for them dissolved in the ocean of apathy and plenty brought about by the flow of money into the villages .

		The last is of such great importance that we must go into details of it .

		We know what enormous expenditures a modern war requires .


Russia	LOCATION	did not have enough gold , and attempts to raise internal loans were unsuccess - ful , owing to the ignorance of the masses .

		Therefore only one way was open to us , to print paper money .

		The sudden increase of its amount in circulation did not fail to show results ; the ruble began to fall in value and prices of commodities began to increase accordingly .

		Inasmuch as the peasant was getting double prices , the peasant sold everything : grain , cattle , linen , grandmother 's dresses .

		`` The village is growing rich , '' shouted the newspapers .

		But soon , very soon , the Russian peasant learned a bitter lesson as to the value of money .

		As thunder from a clear sky came the news of our retreat from the Carpathians in the
spring of 1915	DATE	.

		It was found that in order to proceed with the war we lacked the most necessary commodities ; it was found that our children and fathers were facing the most cruel and powerful enemy totally unarmed .

		This brought about a feverish mobilization of our in - dustry .

		62 THE DIAL
January 25	DATE	The second stage ensued and ran under the motto : `` Everything for the war . ''

		We sacrificed our en - tire industry to the prosecution of the war .

		We did not merely cease to manufacture nails , candles , and agricultural machinery , but we even gave up 75 per cent of our textile industry for war needs .

		And thus the so-called goods famine ensued .

		But the country did not have articles of necessity , and al - though goods were yet to be obtained in the cities nothing reached the village .

		Having money on hand , the peasant found that he could not purchase any - thing with it .

		He could not understand it at first , but when he realized it , he became very angry and refused to sell grain for the army and cities .

		`` I do n't want your money , '' he said to the agents of the
Government	ORGANIZATION	and to merchants who would come for the grain .

		`` Give me gingham , nails , scythes , boots and unless you give me these , you will not get my grain . ''

		During the Czar 's regime even flogging was resorted to , but the peasant was quite determined in his refusal to sell grain .

		As a result of this the army and the cities re - mained without bread , and the cattle were partly consumed and partly starved by lack of hay .

		A shortage of foodstuffs began , and in addition to this many refugees from
Poland	LOCATION	and
Lithuania	LOCATION	fled in the
fall of 1915	DATE	to the interior cities .

		Nevertheless we managed to push through the trying
winter of 1915-16	DATE	.

		And in the
fall of 1916	DATE	the situation became still worse .

		Due to additional recruiting of soldiers a shortage of labor occurred .

		The culti - vated area suffered a decrease of 30 per cent .

		And then in
November	DATE	there was an acute shortage of locomotives on the railroads .

		We never had had many of them .

		And during the war , owing to the in - tensive usage , they were worn out and there was no means of repairing them .

		As a result of this , the railroads were totally disorganized .

		On the Don and in
Siberia	LOCATION	, for instance , grain and hay were rotting at the stations , while on the Roumanian front I personally witnessed how thousands of horses were falling of exhaustion and hunger .

		And the inhabitants had to sustain themselves upon the meat of these fallen horses .

		Conditions in the cities were not much better .

		Hunger and cold penetrated everywhere .

		The most timid citizens began to complain and protest .

		And what meanwhile was going on within the Government ?

		Dissipation with
Rasputin	PERSON	and the placing of favorites in ministerial posts .

		All slightly capable ministers , in spite of pub - lic opinion , were driven out and in their places were put known thieves , cretins , and traitors .

		A sort of madness , hopeless madness , enveloped
Tsarskoye Selo	LOCATION	and in the name of the weak-willed , drunken
Nicholas	PERSON	the Russian people were governed by his German wife and a clique of scoundrels .

		Loyal hands , desiring to uphold the prestige of the throne , assassinated Rasputin ; but in answer to this followed orgies over his corpse , the `` provocation '' of street disturbances in
Petrograd	LOCATION	, and the dispersing of the
Duma	LOCATION	.

		Then the moment came when all of us from
Lenin	LOCATION	to Purishkevitch -LRB- the leader of the famous `` Black Hundred '' -RRB- understood that this sort of thing could not continue any longer , that the Czar 's regime had outlived itself .

		And it fell fell painlessly and with ease , as a decayed apple falls from a tree .

		In place of
Nicholas II	PERSON	came the
Government of Prince Lvoff	ORGANIZATION	, the
Government	ORGANIZATION	of Cadets a revolu - tionary
Government	ORGANIZATION	without revolutionists .

		I shall never forget the comment about this
Government	ORGANIZATION	by a former minister of the Czar ,
Krivoshein	PERSON	.

		`` This Government , '' said
Krivoshein	PERSON	after he was told of its composition , `` has one great fault ; it is too mod - erate .

		Two months ago it would have satisfied the country ; now it is too late .

		It will not have power , and thus , Sirs , you will sacrifice your own newborn child the Revolution and also our all-beloved Fatherland ,
Russia	LOCATION	. ''

		These words proved to be prophetic .

		The composition of the
First Provisional Government	ORGANIZATION	was not in accordance with the senti - ment of the country .

		And as a result , side by side with this
Government	ORGANIZATION	, sprang up the Soviets , backed by the confidence of the great masses of the people .

		Among the ministers of the First Provisional Gov - ernment there were to be found no men with tech - nical experience of state administration .

		Lvoff and
Miliukoff	PERSON	gave ministerial places to their party friends .

		The Director of the Imperial Ballet was given the portfolio of
the Ministry of Finance	ORGANIZATION	; a physician ,
the Ministry of Agriculture	ORGANIZATION	.

		The organization of the Second Provisional Gov - ernment , which included representatives of the radi - cal bourgeoisie and Moderate Socialists , slightly changed the picture .

		They could not very well agree .

		Creative energy was expended in internal strife .

		The compromised decisions were not clear .

		The
Second Provisional Government	ORGANIZATION	also lacked state experience and will-power .

		Doubtless the burden placed upon these governments by events proved to be too heavy .

		The time demanded giants , but instead found midgets .

		But what was the problem of both Provisional Governments with which they could not cope ?

		The Provisional Gov - ernments themselves were saying that their aim was to call a
Constituent Assembly	ORGANIZATION	.

		They did not realize that the Constituent Assembly was not the final end , but only a means , a means of expressing
1919	DATE	THE DIAL the will of the people and of solving problems placed before them .

		The substantial mistake of both Pro- visional Governments was that they mistook the means for the end .

		When the
March Revolution	ORGANIZATION	broke out three colossal questions confronted the Russian people : 1 .

		What is to be done about the war ?

		2 .

		How is the Russian state to be organized ?

		3 .

		How are famine and economic disintegration to be stopped ?

		Now the Constituent Assembly was to be con - voked in ten months .

		Even in normal peaceful times it is impossible to stop the current of life for ten months .

		And a revolution is a social condition in which the pulsation of events is increased ten to twentyfold .

		It ought to have been self-evident that the wheel of national life could not be stopped for ten months either by Lvoff or Kerensky .

		No matter how they urged the convocation of the
Constituent Assembly	ORGANIZATION	, they were themselves compelled by force of events to solve , little by little , the very questions which they desired to give over to the decision of the
Constituent Assembly	ORGANIZATION	.

		Consider the problem of the war .

		Was it possible to say to the Germans : `` Wait , gentlemen .

		Do not shoot until the
Constituent Assembly	ORGANIZATION	meets .

		When it meets , it will decide whether or not we shall go on killing you '' ?

		Even the Allies would not agree to such a decision .

		Yet in spite of the fact that we had sacrificed for the Allies about seven millions of our sons , they demanded that revolutionary
Russia	LOCATION	should participate more actively in the war .

		An answer to these demands should have been given immediately .

		To postpone the answer until the convocation of the
Constituent Assembly	ORGANIZATION	was impossible .

		The Provisional Government realized perfectly well that a hungry , barefooted
Russia	LOCATION	, with its disorganized railroads , could not possibly wage war even as it had during the Czar 's regime .

		And the treaties signed by the Czar and the Allies could have no moral significance for free
Russia	LOCATION	.

		Therefore the circumstances and the dignity of Rus - sia required that the
Provisional Government	ORGANIZATION	give to its Allies a friendly but firm repulse .

		It should have demanded immediate aid and should even have threatened separate peace .

		At that time we still had an army , and the Germans would have paid us highly for a separate peace .

		But our youthful min - isters and ambassadors , instead of taking such a firm course , bowed before the Allies and gave all sorts of assurances that
Russia	LOCATION	would never conclude a separate peace .

		Why then should the Allies have hastened with material aid to
Russia	LOCATION	?

		I do not blame them for it .

		`` One 's own interests are near - est. '' And meanwhile the army was diminishing and diminishing hunger had driven the soldiers from the trenches .

		State administration presented a similar picture .

		Its problems could not be postponed until the con - vocation of the
Constituent Assembly	ORGANIZATION	.

		By force of events the
Provisional Government	ORGANIZATION	was compelled to tolerate the self-appointed unlawful Soviets ; more than that , they had to listen to their demands at - tentively and as a result to proclaim
Russia	LOCATION	a Re - public .

		This measure undoubtedly undermined the prestige of the
Constituent Assembly	ORGANIZATION	and the belief in its indispensability .

		For this the Provisional Gov - ernments could scarcely be blamed .

		Their fault was that they had remained behind the current of life and the expectations of the people .

		And what were these expectations ?

		The capitalists and the
Intelligentsia	LOCATION	, approximately \ -RSB- /
2 per cent	MONEY	of the population , were dreaming only of seizing political power .

		The peasants 75 per cent of the popula - tion were dreaming of the land .

		The soldiers and these numbered about 10 per cent of the popula - tion dreamed of peace and of returning to their dear ones at home ; and finally , the workingmen , who numbered also about 10 per cent , dreamed of seizing control of industry .

		The Provisional Governments promised every - thing , but asked for delay until the convocation of the
Constituent Assembly	ORGANIZATION	.

		But the peasants and workers preferred to realize their desire to get the land and the means of production immediately by revolutionary means .

		`` This is safer .

		At present the power is in our hands , and what will happen tomorrow , we do not know . ''

		This was well under - stood by the
Bolsheviki	PERSON	and this is where the meaning of their doctrine , `` the deepening of the Revolution '' that is , the immediate realization of the people 's desires through revolutionary means lies .

		And here lies the cause of their success .

		Much is being said at present that such a solution of social problems is not democratic , that violence from the Left is just as hideous as violence from the Right .

		In substance this is true , but the trouble is that the Kingdom of God on earth has not come as yet , and force can be crushed only by force .

		Every revolution provokes violence ; why , asked the Rus - sians , is it justifiable to overthrow the Czar by force , and not the bankers ?

		But I have anticipated .

		Before speaking of the present , let us return to the Provisional Govern - ments and see how they solved the third funda - mental problem ; that is , the reorganization of the economic life of the country .

		The question can be answered in a few words : `` They did not solve . ''

		THE DIAL
January 25	DATE	Lacking economic experience and not venturing , for fear of the Allies , to decrease war production or the number of soldiers at the front , the
Provisional Governments	ORGANIZATION	enacted nothing new .

		And conditions were growing worse : occupied with the `` deepening of the Revolution , '' the workmen hardly worked .

		The productivity of shops and factories decreased manyfold .

		General economic disintegration con - stantly increased .

		The villages had no goods , and the cities and army had no bread .

		A real famine ensued and this was followed as usual by robberies and violence .

		They reached their height in
August	DATE	-
September of 1917	DATE	about two months before the Bolshevik Revolution took place .

		The Pro- visional Government even at that time had no authority or power .

		The prestige of any power is always best measured by the forces that rally around it for its defense .

		And the
Provisional Government	ORGANIZATION	for its defense could only rally Junkers , a few Cos - sacks , and the
Women 's Battalion of Death	ORGANIZATION	.

		And it can hardly be said that the Bolshevik offensive was an unexpected blow to the Provisional Govern - ment .

		Just the reverse : the Bolsheviki widely ad - vertised it two weeks in advance , so that the Provi - sional Government had sufficient foreknowledge .

		It is therefore evident that it was in possession of defensive forces and that the popularity of the Pro- visional Government was not greater than that of the
Czar 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		One way or another , fourteen months ago the power was transferred definitely and finally to the Soviets , with the
Bolsheviki	PERSON	as the dominating po - litical power .

		And thus came their turn to decide the vital questions of war , state , and economic organization .

		The question of the war they decided to solve immediately .

		They disclosed the secret treaties showing imperialistic war aims of the En - tente , at the same time offering the Allies a general democratic peace .

		The latter did not even answer !

		And this fact is of utmost importance , because it arouses serious doubt as to who was betrayed by whom whether we have betrayed the Allies , or the Allies have betrayed us .

		Not having received any answer , the Soviet Government started pourparlers for a separate peace .

		It could not possibly have acted differently .

		It was impossible to wage war further : the army had run away , the railroads had come to a standstill .

		Nevertheless , when the preda - tory tendencies of the
Kaiser	PERSON	became evident , the Soviet Government delayed the ratification of the peace treaty and entered into negotiations with the Allies , promising to reestablish the Russian front if the Allies would come to their aid .

		The Allies did not accept this proposal , the sincerity of which can hardly be doubted .

		Lenin was obliged to present the Brest-Litovsk peace treaty for ratification to the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of Soviets .

		At that moment , as far as I am concerned , the question as to who betrayed whom was finally understood and decided .

		Upon presenting the peace treaty for ratification of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	,
Lenin	PERSON	did not deny it was humiliating .

		But at the same time he insisted that this humilia - tion was temporary , that the German revolution was not far away .

		Many did not believe it at that time , but now the German revolution is an accomplished fact .

		As far as state organization was concerned , the Soviet Government decided that at that time the question could be postponed .


Russia	LOCATION	was in the throes of a social revolution and in the midst of a struggle with internal and external enemies of the new order .


Russia	LOCATION	is being built by the plain people , by the peasants slowly , firmly , and without any definite plan .

		To foretell into what forms this re - building will finally shape is utterly impossible .

		It can , however , be definitely said that the present rebuilding of
Russia	LOCATION	is not the last word of the Rus - sian Revolution .

		The word `` Soviet '' will probably remain with us forever .

		The Russian people grew fond of it .

		It was also adopted in
Germany	LOCATION	, but the meaning attached to this word will be perfected in the future .

		However , it must be kept in mind that the controversy which split Russian society into two uncompromising camps does not pertain to its meaning .

		This controversy does not formally touch upon the ideology of the future , but solely concerns the tactics of the present .

		The adherents of one camp say that it is first necessary to shape
Russia	LOCATION	into a definite political form , to establish a per - manent government and to let it decide social prob - lems slowly ; that it is beyond the strength of the Russian people to accomplish a social and political revolution at the same time ; that it is necessary to be satisfied for the present with the political revolu - tion alone , and to bring about the social reforms through evolution .

		More than that , representatives of this camp insist that our people are young and `` dark '' ; that the time has not arrived for them to decide their own destiny ; that the people do not know what they need , but that they , the representa - tives of the radicals and the
Socialist Intelligentsia	ORGANIZATION	, do know .

		Therefore they are the ones to govern the `` dark '' people , to educate the people , to prepare the people for self-government .

		The representatives of the opposition camp , on the other hand , insist that their experiences with the first two Provisional Governments and especially with the third the
Omsk Government	ORGANIZATION	, which is
1919	DATE	THE DIAL now dormant in the pocket of Kolchak is sufficient warning not to repeat mistakes .

		Their deep con - viction is that the Russian people are interested most of all in social reforms and demand these reforms immediately by revolutionary means .

		Yes , the Rus - sian people are `` dark '' and uncultured , but they pos - sess a natural common sense .

		They will acquire their knowledge in the process of reconstruction .

		Without the Intelligentsia they can not possibly get along , but they want to select from the latter those who are willing to serve them , and not those who want to govern them against their will .

		The `` darkness '' of the Russian masses naturally obstructs the tempo of the Russian Revolution .

		I repeat ,
Russia	LOCATION	is being rebuilt by the peasants slowly , firmly , and without any definite plan .

		In this proc - ess of rebuilding much has to be broken down .

		It is also true that it is beyond the power of the Russian people to accomplish both political and social recon - struction .

		Now the Russian people are busy with the construction of a new social order , and when this shall have been crystallized into definite form , they can begin the political construction of
Russia	LOCATION	.

		It can be foretold already that for the new social conditions new political forms will be required .

		It may also be predicted that neither the French nor the American clothes will fit the free Russian peas - ant ; it will be necessary to sew special Russian clothes of new cuts .

		And such work requires time and care : `` Measure the cloth seven times and cut it once , '' says an old Russian proverb .

		And history confirms it .

		Of all the constitutions that were ever written on our planet , the most flexible one has proved to be the Constitution of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Written in
1787	DATE	, with seventeen amendments , it is alive today .

		But it must not be forgotten that it was written in
1787	DATE	, eleven years after the
Declara	LOCATION	- tion of Independence .

		Why then ask of
Russia	LOCATION	that she write her political constitution in definite form only one year after the Revolution , a revolution deeper than that of
1776	DATE	?

		It may be retorted that social reforms require just as much care ; that they also can not be decided in haste .

		I perfectly agree with this , but I also understand that the Russian people do not care to wait any longer and do not trust the `` masters . ''

		No words are strong enough to convince me to the contrary : To back one 's argu - ments with Japanese bayonets and English machine guns is just as criminal , in my opinion , as to assassinate one 's own mother .

		And all the outcries of the interventionists that this is a `` democratic '' way of helping
Russia	LOCATION	are mere hypocrisy .

		When one and one-half years ago the monarchy was overthrown in
Russia	LOCATION	, I , as well as many others , believed that
Russia	LOCATION	could not cope with the political revolution , war , and the social revolution at the same time .

		It was true .

		We were thrown out of the war , and for this we had to pay with the
Brest	LOCATION	- Litovsk treaty .

		But we are confronted with an accomplished fact and we are powerless to turn back the wheel of events .

		We have lost the war , yet in social progress we have taken tremendous steps ahead .

		And now the question is What are we to do ?

		Insist that the social revolution is untimely ?

		Shall we , together with the reactionaries and Czar - ists , liquidate all the gains of the Revolution and assist the French and English in dividing
Russia	LOCATION	among themselves ?

		Or shall we , with our opponents from the Left , defend
Russia	LOCATION	and the Revolution from her internal and foreign enemies ?

		As far as I am concerned , there can be no question , and that is why , while remaining a Moderate Socialist , I sin - cerely and conscientiously believe that I must serve
Russia	LOCATION	under the Soviet banner .

		There is still another point to be considered .

		We may not fully agree with the Soviet Government ; we may doubt the possibility of realizing some of its ideals , but we can hardly deny the fact that it is consistent and clear in its demands .

		The opponents of the Soviet Government have no platform what - soever and they can not have any .

		They represent the most picturesque conglomerate : side by side with old Revolutionists we see former officials of the Czar 's police ; side by side with noble dreamers we see the faces of criminals ; side by side with mon - archists we see anarchists all of them are united in their mad desire to overthrow the Soviet Govern - ment ; and the old English diplomats , who are oper - ating behind their backs , have finally realized that such a union is not stable and that it must be re - placed by a whip .

		And so the Siberian khedive Kolchak has appeared on the - horizon .

		He began his political career with the arrest of the members of the Constituent As - sembly , with the reopening of the vodka factories , and with the reintroduction of the Czar 's rules against Jews .

		So the question is as follows : Kol - chak , or the Soviets ?

		The dictatorship of the work - ing people , or the dictatorship of an insignificant group of adventurers , behind the backs of whom there are foreigners ?

		The people , or generals ?

		The decision is clear .

		The Soviet Government has found it difficult to bring the economic life of
Russia	LOCATION	back to normal .

		The peasants have received the land , but remain without agricultural implements , nails , and textile goods .

		The workmen have obtained control over production , but remain without bread and without 66 THE DIAL
January 25	DATE	coal .

		Production itself has slowed down .

		The most important factor in this situation is the isolation of
Russia	LOCATION	.

		She is practically excluded from the world exchange .

		She is now like a besieged fortress , a fortress which the enemy wants to take , if not by force of arms then by hunger .

		By what right ?

		For what ?

		It is said that we have committed two sins : first , we do not want to pay the debt to
France	LOCATION	.

		Yes , in principle we do not consider ourselves re - sponsible for the Czar 's loans , because part of them were expended for the oppression of the Russian people .

		But practically we do not refuse to discuss this matter this is quite clear from the note of Tchitcherin of
October 26	DATE	.

		Second , it is being said that we have betrayed the Allies .

		In my opinion the Allies have betrayed us and are now dividing among themselves the booty which was promised to us .

		But we do not protest against this .

		Proclaiming a peace without annexations and contributions ,
Russia	LOCATION	has renounced her participation in the division of any booty .

		But having sacrificed for the Allies 7,000,000 of her sons , she is justified in demanding that she be left alone .

		But let us assume for a sec - ond that we are guilty of breaking a treaty : then what about
Italy	LOCATION	who broke the treaty with the
Central Powers	ORGANIZATION	?

		She is being complimented on it !

		But we also have a third sin , of which people do not speak aloud : we are weak , but our land is rich why not make use of it ?

		I understand this perfectly well .

		Together with
England	LOCATION	we par - titioned
Persia	LOCATION	and only a short while ago we dreamed of the partition of
Austria	LOCATION	and
Turkey	LOCATION	.

		And now we are being partitioned !

		I understand it all .

		I understand the English and French very well , but I can not understand the Americans at all .

		We owe you very little ; we have no treaties with you and never had any , and in the division of Rus - sia you do not intend to participate .

		Why then do you keep your soldiers in
Russia	LOCATION	?

		The interests of the
United States	LOCATION	do not conflict with the interests of
Russia	LOCATION	.

		More than that , no other country is more interested in the realization of the ideals of the freedom of the seas and the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	, which your President is faithfully upholding in
Europe	LOCATION	, than
Russia	LOCATION	.

		All our seas are not free .

		Our Government is most of all international .

		Moreover the interests of exchange between
Russia	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	at present should be mutual .

		During the war the
United States	LOCATION	has tremendously developed her pro- duction , and she needs foreign markets .


Russia	LOCATION	could be one .

		She needs goods .

		She can not of herself increase production and stimulate industry .

		Yet we have plenty to pay with : our natural re - sources are enormous .

		The question of how to utilize these resources in order to pay for your goods may be decided upon by mutual understanding and discussion either in
Washington	LOCATION	or in
Moscow	LOCATION	, but surely this can not be decided by mutual destruction in the swamps of Archangel .

		The Soviet Govern - ment has attempted many a time to begin such dis - cussions .

		This argument is usually disposed of by referring to the Bolshevik danger .

		First of all , the responsi - bility of power has compelled the Bolsheviki to be - come more moderate .

		Second , the Soviets and the
Bolsheviki	PERSON	are not one and the same .

		The
Bolshe	PERSON	- viki at the present time dominate the Soviets to a great extent because of the policy of the Allies .

		Yet , fearing Bolshevism , you are cultivating it .

		More than that , by your actions you justify its ideology .

		As far as the philosophic side of the question is con - cerned , we differ from the
Bolsheviki	PERSON	in the matter of natural impulses .

		The
Bolsheviki	PERSON	say that such impulses are only class interests .

		We , realizing that class interests are the most important interests of mankind , nevertheless believe that mankind has other interests : religious , moral , national , and esthetic .

		At present this point of view is being subjected to a difficult trial .

		There is some ground for your accusation that the
Bolsheviki	PERSON	are serving the interests of one class only .

		But what about those who attempt to tighten a steel lasso around the neck of
Russia	LOCATION	, those who forget that she came to this condition righting with the Allies and for the Allies whom are those interventionists serving ?

		The class interests of the propertied class or the ideal of justice ?

		Is it really possible that these ideals are

KINGSLEY RICHARDSON	PERSON	.

		1919 THE DIAL 67 The Guns in
Surrey	LOCATION	: A Meredith Remembrance E DAYS AGO , in a car with two French officers , I swirled through rain and mud into the eviscerated towns of Villeneuve and Fere-en-Tardenois in the
Chateau-Thierry	LOCATION	sector .

		It was , they told me , the first correspondent 's car to enter these places on the iron heel of the military occupation .

		As now I roam the rural lanes and meadows of
England	LOCATION	, where `` cows flap a slow tail knee-deep in river '' and primeval beeches spread an umbrageous coolness on my pathway , I can distinctly hear , thudding against the air , the great guns at the Front in Flan - ders and in
Normandy	LOCATION	.

		I have seen how the cannon tore the heart out of bleeding village after bleeding village there in
France	LOCATION	.

		I went from one incredible crater of ruin to the next , and I felt amid the bare and aching desolation as one might feel who wandered in the arid silence of the mountains of the moon .

		I could not reconcile the sight with the world we know and love , the world we live in the owls and foxes of Ossian never looked on so complete a bankruptcy of all the beauty of this good green earth : nor ever did the ghoulish ululation of hyena , jackal , or coyote fall on a place so lonely .

		Let not these broken walls , these bleaching heaps of rubble , these frac - tured shells of lath and plaster be likened to Pom - peii and
Herculaneum	LOCATION	for these ruins are of today , and they still pulsate and throb , are warm and bleed and agonize .

		Still they cry out to God from a soil moist with the blood of his innocents , to know if he has abdicated his white throne or will come to them agajn and bless and heal their brokenness .

		I did not understand how the stars - could look down complacently , or the sweet birds be singing , or the flowers
spring	DATE	again in the red of poppies , the white of the `` Queen 's necklace , '' the blue of corn - flowers , round shell-holes of green scum , implements of battle charred and rusted , bodies still denied a burial .

		Yet I saw men , with three horses in a team , reap the wheat , eluding the unexploded shells and the pit - falls .

		I saw the peasants trudging back to encamp amid the jagged walls that were their houses , as the dwellers on
Aetna	ORGANIZATION	or Vesuvius hobble over the cool - ing lava to their denuded vineyards .

		I saw `` love among the ruins , '' and life too was there ; and when I talked with a man whose visible worldly assets were a manure pile and a pitchfork , he des - canted indignantly not on the plight of his own vil - lage but on the sacrilege at
Rheims	LOCATION	.

		On the way from
London	LOCATION	to Box Hill you pass through
Leatherhead	LOCATION	, where men blinded in war - fare are wrapping poles with wickerwork to make roadways for the guns , and
Mitcham	LOCATION	, where the fin - est lavender field in
England	LOCATION	has surrendered to the utilitarian potato .

		Detraining at Box Hill station , I halted at the inn where
Keats	PERSON	poured out his soul upon the moonlight , in the last lines of Endymion .

		There I inquired the way to
George Meredith	PERSON	's house .

		It was scarcely more than the turn of a corner distant .

		Outside the gate was a little boy who did not know about
George Meredith	PERSON	, but he balanced in a basket on his round blue cap a pig 's head he firmly intended to deliver to the cook .

		Between the pink ears of the pig , upthrust like rifle-sights above the rim of the basket , one beheld a garden of exceeding loveliness .

		The face of the dark stone house , ivy-mantled , had for eyes toward the sunlight white-rimmed windows that gazed benevolently upon a close-cropped , smooth-rolled oval green with a sundial in the midst , geraniums , and orange-tinted begonias .

		Inclosing the lawn was a noble hedge , half again a tall man 's height , of box and yew with not a dead leaf showing in the dense contexture .

		Beyond the hedge was Coe the gardener , whose time and hand-and-foot devotion belonged to
George Meredith	PERSON	for thirty years .

		If a man is not a hero to his valet , no adage forbids the homage of a gar - dener .

		`` I can see him now , '' said
Coe	PERSON	, dropping the hoe - handle and dusting his broad hands against each other briskly , `` I can see him as he ran across the lawn from the gate waving a letter , and I can hear him call up to his wife 's window ` The Americans have discovered me ! '

		It was a letter from one of you about
Diana	PERSON	of the Crossways .

		`` He gave me the manuscripts of
Diana	LOCATION	, of The Amazing Marriage , and of One of Our Conquer - ors .

		I sold them to Mr.
Pierpont Morgan	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Morgan	PERSON	's butler heard Mr.
Morgan	PERSON	say to some - body at dinner in
New York	LOCATION	: ` Yes , and I 'd have paid him twice as much if he had asked it . '

		The butler told a friend of mine , and he told me .

		I wish I had asked twice as much . ''

		He spied a weed , and stooped to pull it .

		Then he led the way by hobnails to the tiny chalet on the edge of the wood above the garden , where the master wrote and paced the forest path and musefully re - garded the blue distance of the vale .

		The spirit of the poems Melampus and Outer and Inner , or of the meeting of
Richard	PERSON	and Lucy , trembled in the air .

		68 THE DIAL
January 25	DATE	`` Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	had a board across his knee when he wrote , '' said
Coe	PERSON	.

		`` He did n't use a table .

		He had a dachshund too .

		He admired the Germans for some things he always felt they were such tre - mendous scholars .

		He thought well of the French , too , and in a fighting way .

		`
Coe	PERSON	, ' he said to me one day , ` if our armies were led by French officers we could walk over the world . '

		`` Here 's where he did his own walking , sir , mostly . ''

		He parted the bushes to a little path that ran along behind the chalet , accurately , and as though it knew its own mind , for a distance of perhaps five hundred feet .

		Holly , yew , and pines were thick beside and above the narrow way .

		`` He would gather the twigs , '' said
Coe	PERSON	, `` and tell me to make a price on them .

		He 'd give the money to his daugh - ter , for her good works .

		` Fourpence , ' I would say when he pointed to a little pile he had collected .

		` Now
Coe	PERSON	, ' he would say , ` do n't be unreasonable !

		You know very well that pile is worth two shillings if it 's worth a penny . '

		But I was firm with him , sir , and it was my price I paid him .

		`` He would sit here in the chalet thinking and writing , in his shirt sleeves , when he was n't walking up and down the path . ''

		` Do you know what time it is ? '

		I 'd ask him . ''

		` No . ' ''

		` It 's six o'clock , ' I 'd tell him .

		` Time for you to be getting ready for your dinner . '

		`` But I could n't get him to knock off and come down to the house as if he was an ordinary human being . ''

		` It 's here ,
Coe	PERSON	! '

		he 'd cry , excited-like .

		` It 's here !

		No use trying when It is n't here ! '

		Then he would go on writing , and his soup was cold .

		`` After breakfast , every day , he had his cigar , and his paper , and then he waited for It to come .

		`` If anybody came and there was anything in the upper story , he was delighted .

		`` A Publisher came from
America	LOCATION	. ''

		-LRB-
Coe	PERSON	pro- nounced `` publisher '' with a capital . -RRB- '

		` Well , what do you want my books for ? '

		he said .

		` You can get plenty of books in
America	LOCATION	. '

		`` The Publisher said , ` Aye , we can get plenty , but they would flare up over your head for twenty-five minutes and then fade out .

		We want your books , to circulate them in cheap covers and make them known among the crowd .

		Your books will live . '

		`` The answer seemed to please him .

		`` Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	slept here in this little hut , and here he had his bath .

		For some time he used a swinging hammock for his bed , but he did n't have much comfort in it .

		He got the idea from meeting on a steamship a passenger who had one .

		He used to complain about it to me , because it would creak and sway and the mattress would get in a big lump on one side .

		`` Once we went to visit , and he slept in a bed that was on all fours , very substantial , sir , and very restful .

		`` I said to him afterwards , ` Why ca n't you have a similar sort of a bed at Box Hill , sir ? '

		`` So he let me get him one of iron , and he liked it well .

		`` He was walking and thinking and writing to the end of his days , though he grew feeble and leaned more and - more upon my arm .

		He was vexed he could n't climb the hill so easily .

		His body was dying ; but his head was as brisk as ever . ''

		We left the gardener to his watering-pot , his borders , and his memories , and crossed the vale to the slope of the further hill and stepped into the little old thatched chapel with its red oak beams St.
Michael	PERSON	's chapel ,
West Humble	LOCATION	, parish of
Michael	PERSON	- ham .

		The heads of pigs and the heads of saints , gargoyle-wise , were cheek by jowl among the ancient rafters .

		Was there anything symbolic in my meet - ing the pig 's head in the butcher-boy 's hands , in such close juxtaposition to the spiritual almost ethereal features of
George Meredith	PERSON	?

		An aeroplane droned overhead and the guns at the Front were throbbing like muffled drums , and the words of
Enid Bagnold	PERSON	floated into mind : And there thumps at the heart of the hill On the house-wall and runs In the grass at the foot of the trees The Reminder .

		The guns .

		Every field , road , and the lane of the region was mapped by the Germans ere Mr.
Britling	PERSON	saw it through .

		The Battle of Dorking had been planned .

		German barons owned estates in the vicinage .

		When the German Emperor was in
England	LOCATION	at the dedication of the
Victoria Memorial	ORGANIZATION	a decade ago he toured the south coast with his staff officers for weeks .

		But the beech and the yew , the holly and the bracken whispered naught of this to me as we clam - bered meanderingly to the high , free openness of Ranmore Common over the virid felt of the
spring	DATE	- ing sod .

		Ranmore church , the creation of Sir
Gil	PERSON	- bert
Scott	PERSON	in flint rubble , seemed nothing for a Sur - rey landscape to be very proud of as a beacon : but as we came down the hill on the other side toward
Westcott	LOCATION	, braking and sliding on our heels , I liked what my friends thought aloud of the common land .

		They spoke with the voice of the people .

		`` When WE have the right of way , WE have it forever .

		Over the tops of the beeches that firmly kept their footing in the shale , we saw vistas that realized L'Allegro and II Penseroso , and I stopped to stroke the nose of a strawberry roan with shaggy fetlocks who put his head over the stile in a sober curiosity .

		There were hedgerows of yews and Scotch firs stand - ing in a luminous translation of the sunlight into golden Vandyke brown .

		By unromantically named
Pipp Brook	ORGANIZATION	below us , we espied the white convolvu - lus , the evening primrose , the massed rhododendrons only the leaves and even -LRB- pray , what was it do - ing in that gallery ? -RRB-

		a young thicket of bamboo .

		Somewhere in the vicinity , once upon a time , there was a bell known as the `` Wipers Bell '' from the name of
Ypres	LOCATION	, whence it was brought in the time of
Edward III	ORGANIZATION	.

		Someone has lost it , within living memory .

		How careless of him , to misplace a ton or two of bell-metal !

		But the name `` Wipers Bell '' is still a household word in this withdrawn and quiet neighborhood , as though to bear witness that the British soldier 's pronunciation of the famous Flanders city is no new thing under the sun .

		The beginnings of Tillingbourne stream trickled from an iron pipe at the road 's edge , but a man came with a bucket and took it away for his horses under our very eyes .

		Lo !

		the beech-mast , beloved of our rummaging four-footed little brother Porcus since before the Romans came .

		Where are we coming ?

		`` Friday Street ! ''

		A curious name for a village .

		Can it be Frigedoeges treow
Friday	DATE	's tree ?

		These fox - gloves remind us that digitalis is now extracted from them , even as belladonna is expressed from the deadly nightshade so that no longer need
England	LOCATION	depend on
Germany	LOCATION	for the supply of these things .

		But where is
Friday	DATE	Street ?

		Is the street sign writ perchance in honeysuckle ?

		Over the hedgerow a voice impinges musically on our discussion .

		`` You are at the beginning of
Friday	DATE	Street now . ''

		A scarlet bush of geum gleams brilliantly at the door , with a fiery trail of climbing nasturtium on the doorposts .

		How dull we were that we did not know !

		On the great flank of Leith Hill the Evelyns , descendants of
John	PERSON	, still are lords of the manor , and their sign let the Germans take notice for - bids among other things the deposit of old metal .

		So that we seem to be safe .

		The gorse pricks us resentfully as we force a shorter path through it to the crest of the hill .

		`` When is kissing not in season ?

		When the gorse is not in bloom . ''

		That is to say , for about six weeks of the running year .

		What means this white circle drawn about a Scotch fir ?

		It is marked for slaughter that it may go to line the trenches .

		Circumventing a rabbit-warren with nobody at home we come out through the mel - low , kine-like breath of the trees and the sod to a gaunt tower on the hilltop .

		It was placed over the remains of someone .

		I do not wonder that he remained .

		From a height of a thousand feet above sea level one looks out over laughing leagues of farming land and woodland , the dark green of oaks and elms shading to the fawn yellow of the exuberant fields of wheat and oats , sun-dappled or beclouded .

		The sea is barely to be descried .

		The fields are irregu - lar of outline compared with those of Fiance dnd .


Belgium	LOCATION	.

		Their corners are as eccentrically angu - lar as broken glass .

		The air of security with which the cows and sheep of
England	LOCATION	browse and drowse militates against all prospect of such pitiable desolation as one sees in the invaded countryside of
France	LOCATION	.

		How could it happen here ?

		How could the shells hurtle blasphemously into a village dreaming under its thatches and its honeysuckle , its geraniums and its climbing roses ?

		It is left to the old men and the women to labor in the fields where once the feet of the young men trod sturdily .

		They are beyond the Channel or beyond the stars .

		It is they who make these dull reverberations of the guns that smite our ears .

		When .

1919	DATE
THE DIAL Military Training	ORGANIZATION	as Education I N SPITE OF the `` war to end war , '' many good citi - zens are urging the establishment of universal - mili - tary training in this country .

		If , as we were as - sured so many times during the past two years , the defeat of
Germany	LOCATION	will permit the nations to organ - ize for peace without fear of unexpected interrup - tion , the proposal must be advanced because its advo - cates believe six months or more in the army will be indispensable in American education .

		Now what is the educational value of military training in times of peace ?

		Ask the next man you see , and he will doubtless say , as did an officer at the farewell dinner of our training company , that it teaches a man to keep his shoes shined and his trousers creased , and to say `` sir '' to his seniors .

		It may also help him to learn how to stand straight .

		Other benefits are , indeed , expected .

		There is a vague approval of the `` discipline '' which a short experience of the military regime is supposed to in - stil into our unruly youth .

		Often this seems to be merely a polite expression of the hope that laborers will be taught not to strike and servants to be more zealous .

		But behind that exists a more worthy feel - ing that if our young men are all run through the military machine we shall as a nation understand better how to work together and to produce more efficiently the results we want .

		And underlying all is an instinct which helped to send many of us into the army .

		It is the desire to get away from a too artificial and overcivilized world , a desire to gain power from victory over primitive hardships .

		The nation will become more masculine , it is believed , if men are thrown together and taught how to get along in a hostile world .

		However it may have been with the men who saw actual fighting in
France	LOCATION	, those of us who re - mained six months or more in camps on this side felt an immense relief in returning to civilian simplicity and directness after the curiously artificialized ex - istence of the army .

		The man who puts on a uni - form soon discovers that he has not come nearer to reality on the contrary , that he is farther away from it than ever .

		Every moment is formalized into a stiff pattern of behavior which is as difficult to practice gracefully as the etiquette of a
Bour	PERSON	- bon court .

		A dozen times a day the soldier is called to a formality at which he dare not be a mo - ment late , and what he does at this formality has no more relation with the trade of war or any useful accomplishment than if he were practicing the latest tango in a ballroom .

		He learns to hold his rifle in certain positions , to move it expeditiously and in a predetermined series of motions from one of these positions to another , to take his appointed place in many complicated formations of troops but no one of these rifle positions or formations of men is ever used in battle .

		When saluting a superior officer he must hold his hand and arm at a certain angle ; he must learn in deep detail when to salute and when not to salute . '

		Except for brief periods of rest , the whole time of the recruit is taken up with intensive training in these and a hun - dred other rituals , and the effort to be letter-perfect in them is as exacting as must be the education of an English butler .

		When a man becomes proficient in them he is called `` a good soldier , '' and it is fre - quently said that a good soldier can not be made inside of three years ; in fact some old sergeants assert that a good soldier must be born .

		At any rate , the attention which the recruit must give to such matters absorbs nearly all his intelligence and nervous energy .

		So absorbing were they , that it was difficult to remember that a war was being fought .

		The expected intimacy with the primitive did not appear .

		We slept in wooden buildings , on cots and mattresses , and between sheets .

		Our food was fur - nished according to regulations from the
Quarter	DATE	- master , and cooked on stoves by cooks appointed and trained for that purpose .

		In none of the organi - zations of which I was a member were tents pitched , and the anticipated practice in the uses of a rifle was confined to one half a day on the range .

		We had some exercise , but not so much as any man an get in an outdoor job or in a camping or sailing trip .

		It must not be supposed that any changes in this regime will be made as a result of the war .

		The first dogma of the military man is that training of this sort , rather than training in the actual business of warfare , is necessary as a kind of first coat before the final polish of field maneuvers can be applied .

		`` The best battery on the parade ground is the best battery in action . ''

		Traditional infantry drill , like the traditional classics in our older colleges , is sup - posed to furnish an essential disciplinary ` basis for any more practical exercise .

		We ought therefore to consider whether forcing young men to behave according to these strange formalities for a few months is likely to produce the benefits anticipated .

		The constant obedience which is required to make men alert in essentially ridiculous accom - plishments is thought of intrinsic value by many .

		Yet it is doubtful whether such obedience , solemn - THE DIAL ly enforced as it is by the fear of unpleasant pun - ishments , can form a habit which will last long in the more natural civilian environment , where superiors may be selected , and a man 's worth is more often measured by his originality and initiative than by his lack of it .

		The effect of such discipline before the war ended was merely repressive , and brought about nothing but an urgent desire to escape it .

		On the one hand many men were eager to get to the front , where `` something real was doing , '' and they would at least have a chance to employ themselves in an undertaking which seemed to have some reason for existence .

		On the other hand those of any ambition were eager to become officers and so escape the stultifying obligations of the ranks .

		The only ones who remained inert under the routine were a few old regular army men to whom it had become an easy and professional habit , one which they would relinquish only reluctantly for any occupation demanding mental effort .

		It is pure myth that the soldier acquires any capa - bility in cooperation for hard work .

		Most of the tasks imposed upon him , particularly the physical labor usually known as `` fatigue duty , '' are obviously invented to keep him busy .

		No one watches his work except to prevent him from loafing .

		He knows that a hard worker will acquire little credit from superiors , but will on the other hand be regarded by his comrades as a scab .

		He knows that the more he accomplishes the more will be given him to do .

		If he happens to begin his duties under the command of a good-natured sergeant he will probably be warned that there is no particular use in exerting himself .

		Many a man has told me that he never had such an easy time of it as regards work before he entered the army .

		The prevailing effort of the enlisted man is to shirk as much as possible .

		The colloquial use of `` soldiering '' is well justified by fact .

		One of the most common remarks of the private is that the army has made him so lazy that he will never be able to do good work again .

		Those of us who succeeded in getting to an offi - cers ' training school found plenty to keep us busy , and we seemed closer to the activities which we had expected to find in war .

		We still felt , however , the gray repression caused by the stiff pattern of rou - tine .

		I often wondered how much of our energy and interest was due to our desire to be effective in the war against
Germany	LOCATION	, and how much to any validity in the military method itself .

		So far as we did good work and gained anything at all out of the highly formalized teaching , it often seemed to me that we did so only through a con - sciousness of our function in the actual hostilities .

		When the armistice was announced the answer to my question came .

		A striking failure of morale was felt throughout the school , the commandant be - ing so worried by it that he announced that we should probably be retained in the service another year .

		Yet now the purpose for which we en - tered the army was removed , almost everyone found his studies only something to be endured in silence until he could get out of his uniform .

		When the announcement came that candidates could make a choice between immediate discharge and remaining to win reserve commissions on inactive duty , all classes except those within a week or two of gradua - tion melted away , and this in spite of a most deter - mined effort on the part of the responsible officers to bring disrepute on the men who availed them - selves of the privilege of resignation .

		Will the men who have experienced military edu - cation under the semi-peaceful conditions on this side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	favor universal training ?

		If to do so meant that they would have to spend another day in the service , the negative majority would be overwhelming .

		During my six months in uniform I have not talked with a single officer or man who was a civilian before the war and intended to remain in the army after the end of the emer - gency .

		Yet one is inclined , once an unprofitable experience is over , to count it a benefit and grant it a sentimental value .

		The men who would be sent to camp under the proposed law are not yet of voting age .

		Their elders may exhibit the quite human trait of wishing to enforce on the younger genera - tion the same drilling they themselves have endured .

		There is also the impulse to exalt a loyalty to one 's own past .

		At our farewell dinner the officers caught up .

		the spirit of fellowship naturally existing among so many men who had lived so strangely together , and converted it into loyalty to the school and the army .

		We were flattered on our record , bidden to speak well of the military , to behave like soldiers the rest of our lives , and to vote for universal service .

		Such counsels are sure to have their effect .

		But the public should not take without critical examina - tion the arguments usually advanced in behalf of military training as a method of education for peace .

		They should , on the contrary , weigh well such statements as were made by our commandant , when he expressed his sympathy because we had missed so narrowly the chance of fighting Germans , and at - tempted to console us by adding that labor troubles were imminent in this country , and that we might be called out at any time for `` riot duty . ''


GEORGE SOULE	PERSON	.

		1919 THE DIAL 73
Lamartine	PERSON	, the Patriot of the
February Revolution	ORGANIZATION	, / YN AMERICAN LIFE of Lamartine seems at first blush as appropriate as a French life of Long - fellow .

		Mr.
Whitehouse	PERSON	's two volumes -LRB- The Life of
Lamartine Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 16	MONEY	-RRB- are not in - tended primarily for scholars , and as for the casual reader , he has learned long ago that
Lamartine	PERSON	, like
Longfellow	LOCATION	, is little more than a
Wordsworth	PERSON	manque an estimate which the present work in the main upholds .

		La poesie lamartinienne had its day and will continue to have its Brahmans .

		Le Lac and 1 ` Isolement are unrivaled in their harmony and romantic idealism .

		Sainte-Beuve celebrated their appearance in the words : `` One passed suddenly from a poetry dry , meagre and poor , to a poetry broad , abundant , elevated and all divine . ''

		But the world at large is cast in a rougher mold ; it is at once more sophisticated and more simple because more experienced and profound ; and it is to the credit of Lamartine that he himself held `` this sublime gift of the gods in slight esteem . ''

		At the height of his literary fame -LRB- 1838 -RRB- he wrote to a friend : `` Poetry has never been more to me than a prayer ; the most beautiful and intense > act of thought , but the shortest , and the one which deducts the least from the day 's work . ''

		The fact is , and it is the object of Mr.
Whitehouse	PERSON	to keep us from for - getting it , that
Lamartine	PERSON	's `` day 's work '' was politi - cal and not literary .

		The poet who in his youth sang of
Graziella	PERSON	and Elvire , whose Wertherized soul longed for eternity , who in
1818	DATE	was all `` de - spair and loneliness and lack of interest , '' is the self - same person who in
1847	DATE	wrote the Histoire des Girondins ; who a year later aided if he did not instigate the fall of the
July	DATE	monarchy , and who during the bedlam that followed alone had the cour - age and the skill not to speak of his tireless energy to conciliate the mob and to establish at least the semblance of a constitutional form of government .

		That in so doing he simply replaced one form of autocracy by another , the bourgeois reactionary
Louis Philippe	PERSON	by the glittering imperialist
Louis Napoleon	PERSON	, adds to the tragedy of his already tragic life .

		But the unfortunate result can not in the least mar Lamartine 's heroism or cloud the disinterested ideal of which he was as much a victim as an origi - nator .

		There is no denying it : Lamartine made a strange Minister of Foreign Affairs for the Provi - sional Government Heine wittily called him `` Minister foreign to Affairs '' and a still stranger revolutionary leader , aristocratic as his origin and demeanor were .

		But he was the man-of-the-hour if ever an individual was , and neither his country nor the world at large has ever accorded him the honor that is properly his .

		Thus , it is particularly as a vindication of Lamartine the poet-politician , that Mr.
Whitehouse	PERSON	has written his life .

		The world into which
Alphonse	PERSON	was born in
1790	DATE	was one of turmoil and upheaval ; and so it remained until his declining years .

		Well documented , Mr.
Whitehouse	PERSON	neglects no important detail of the fam - ily history .

		Faithful to their royalist attachments the poet 's parents weathered the storm of the Great Revolution tant bien que mal , giving to their son as `` free '' an education as their means and lights al - lowed , both of which were considerable .

		The
Chev	ORGANIZATION	- alier as the father was called had a marked lean - ing for literature and literary composition , while the mother , the stronger influence with the poet , united an `` inexorable Catholicism '' to a sentimen - tal admiration for
Rousseau	PERSON	.

		`` Doubtless , '' writes her son , `` because
Rousseau	PERSON	possessed more than genius : he had soul . ''

		And it is precisely this qual - ity , more than genius , insight , or ideas that is charac - teristic of Lamartine himself .

		Another significant fact is the reenforcement of the Rousseauistic prin - ciples by the poet 's contact with the peasantry of the family estate at
Milly	LOCATION	and by the soothing , reli - gious atmosphere of the Jesuit school in
Belley	LOCATION	with its beautiful surroundings and its proximity to the Alps .

		Desultory as
Lamartine	PERSON	's education was , the aristocratic background , the Jesuit training for ac - tion , the humanitarianism of
Rousseau	PERSON	and later of
Madame de Stae	ORGANIZATION	' l of whom he became a great ad - mirer conspired to instil in him a belief in the progress of mankind and in himself as its prophet which only the complete disillusionment of later life was to destroy .

		To say then that Lamartine carried the Roman - ticism of literature into politics is not enough .

		As early as
1811	DATE	he confessed to his friend Virieu : `` Je me suis cree des societes comme des mai tresses : ` imaginaires . ' ''

		This remark is far truer of the latter than the former .

		The detail did not escape the alert eye of
Anatole France	LOCATION	in his , 1 ` Elvire de Lamartine .

		Only Mr.
Whitehouse	PERSON	is precise in saying : `` Whatever the relations between Lamartine and
Madame Charles	ORGANIZATION	may have been ... the limpid purity , the lofty spirituality of his poetry , for the birth of which she was directly responsible , is beyond all cavil .

		It was an ideal that
Lamartine	PERSON	loved , perhaps , but
Julie	PERSON	was not unworthy of the idealization to which she was subjected . ''

		74 THE DIAL
January 25	DATE	And he further notes that , as
Madame Charles	PERSON	her - self was to learn with bitterness , the fisherman 's daughter
Graziella	PERSON	had already inspired similar lofty effusions on the poet 's part , and
Madame Charles	PERSON	`` not unnaturally objected to being classed in her lover 's mind with the little Neapolitan grisette .

		With an eye on posterity she protested at being one day styled ` une bonne femme , pleine de coeur , ' who had loved the poet Lamartine . ''

		So much for the lover .

		As for Lamartine the politician , he too ideal - ized , and the glamour in which he enveloped his political acts are , in his biographer 's opinion , the main cause of his gravest mistakes .

		Only an ideal - ist could cling to a faith in the progressive liberalism of the French nation and in his own popularity at the moment when the reactionary forces , appar - ent to all but him , were about to seat
Napoleon III	PERSON	on his uncle 's throne .

		`` M. de
Lamartine n'entend	PERSON	rien a la politique , '' scornfully said the radical Ledru-Rollin , the opponent whom
Lamartine	PERSON	was not only to outwit but to treat with unparalleled generosity .

		We must grant that ``
Lamartine	PERSON	did not possess , politically speaking , a very fine sense of values . ''

		Of the great French quality , esprit , he had not a glimmer .

		And yet the truth is that
Lamartine	PERSON	the politician is a complex of qualities .

		Poetry apart , he was essentially a being cleft into by opposing ten - dencies : an aristocrat 's generosity -LRB- which never failed him -RRB- , a poet 's enthusiasm and vanity , and a statesman 's instinct for conciliation and general ideas .

		To these traits should be added an ineradic - able aloofness which may have been the product of the conflicting elements named .

		Some such conclusion the reader will draw from Mr.
Whitehouse	PERSON	's illuminating pages .

		The traits are there , though not always connectedly set forth .

		Mr.
Whitehouse	PERSON	narrates well .

		The chapters on the Abdication of
Louis Philippe	LOCATION	, the Provisional Gov - ernment , the thrilling Sixteenth of
April	DATE	, and
Louis Napoleon Bonaparte	PERSON	, read like a romance .

		An eye - witness of those momentous days could not have seen as much for he would have had to be ubiquitous .

		Nor does the hero fail to occupy the center of the action or occupy it unnecessarily : Lamartine 's absences from the arena are as significant as his presences .

		Thus we get a picture of the `` man ''
Lamartine	PERSON	, as a boy , a lover , a diplomat , a traveler in the Orient , a husband , a father , and a patriot .

		Above all , we are present at the adventure of
Lake Bourget	LOCATION	, when
Julie	PERSON	comes to possess his glowing soul , once for all ; we see him in the Chambre in the heat of debate , in the anguish of those sleepless nights during the Revolution , when he expected every moment to be shot and yet never quailed , in the streets of the mob-ridden capital when the lightning played about his head and he nevertheless found the words to calm the mob , and we accompany him in his mo - ment of triumph on the fifteenth of
May	DATE	as he rode through
Paris	LOCATION	to the shouts of
Vive la Republique	ORGANIZATION	.

		Perhaps it is captious to ask for more , still we long for a synthesis of so many details .

		Fascinating as Mr.
Whitehouse	PERSON	's account is , the `` complete '' La - martine does not altogether emerge .

		One reason for this doubtless is that Mr.
White	PERSON	- house has isolated his hero somewhat more than the facts warrant .

		It is true we are told : A Legitimist and Monarchist by tradition , but a pro- gressive and fervent advocate , by conviction , for the most generous grants of political , and social liberties ,
Lamar	PERSON	- tine invariably struggled for the doctrines he upheld .

		But the idea is not developed and its relationship to the philosophy of Cousin one of the progenitors of our own Transcendentalism is not recognized .

		That
Lamartine	PERSON	's pantheism , noted by Mr.
White	PERSON	- house en passant , is akin to
Cousin	ORGANIZATION	's Spontaneous Reason `` acquainting us with the true and essential nature of things , '' is shown among other instances by the poet 's advice to Lord Byron : Descends du rang des dieux qu'usurpait ton audace ; Tout est bien , tout est ban , tout est grand a sa place .

		And also by the poetic one is tempted to say `` po - litical '' application he makes of it in the preface to Jocelyn : Les hommes ne s ` interessent plus tant aux individual - ites , ils les prennent pour ce qu'elles sont : des moyens ou des obstacles dans 1 ` oeuvre commune .

		L'interet du genre humain s ` attache au genre humain lui-meme .

		La poesie redevient sacree par la verite , comme elle le fut jadis par la fable ; elle redevient religieuse par la raison , et populaire par la philosophic .

		L'epopee n'est plus nationale ni heroique , elle est bien plus , elle est humanitaire .

		However it is Humanity in no modern , sociological sense of first-hand acquaintance , but Humanity as a Platonic vision , a Wertherized , Ossianic fusion of lyric motifs set to the roll of harmonious and re - sounding music .

		Such is the verse the poet writes , such are the orations he pronounces in the Cham - bre or to the populace of the Revolution .

		This , it seems , is the dominant and connecting motive of this extraordinary life .

		Lamartine was a chantre or , as Mr.
Whitehouse	PERSON	recognizes at the outset , a vates .

		Had he himself not made the descent he the son of the ancien regime which he urges upon Byron ?

		The Republic was to him the fruition of those who reason `` spontaneously , '' not from be - low but from above .

		`` Ou servir des idees , ou rien , voila ma devise , '' he wrote to the
Marquis de la Grange	ORGANIZATION	.

		Hence the attempt or attempts to place the monarchy on the side of the people ; and hence THE DIAL 75 when these failed , his efforts by conciliatory means to brush the monarchy aside and let the people rule though he considered that the moment was prema - ture ; hence finally the failure to see , because of the obsession that held him , the forces which were gath - ering for his destruction .

		This is not to deny him certain real political qualities : he could be astute , as when he kept the Opposition guessing or when he refused posts obviously beyond his capacities ; he made friends , few to be sure but genuine ones ; he upheld the national prestige abroad despite a foreign policy often ill-advised .

		All these points his biog - rapher sees and is just to .

		But he might have dwelt at greater length on the faculte maitresse of his hero : the clarifying side of the man that made him at once a patriot and a seer .

		For visionary and facile as
Lamartine	PERSON	was , and pre - mature as he realized some of his policies to be , he yet was right in so far that democracy must be coupled with magnanimity , that any so-called liberal form of government must be founded on the higher instincts of the race and have faith in them and consistently appeal to them as
Lamartine	PERSON	did or democracy like the autocracy it seeks to destroy is another name for tyranny .

		The tragedy of
Lamar	PERSON	- tine 's life is epitomized in the phrase : J'ai vecu pour la joule , je veux dormir seul .

		It would be a greater tragedy still if the principle for which he lived should prove illusory .


WILLIAM A. NITZE	PERSON	.

		The Modern Point of View and the New Order VIII .

		THE VESTED INTERESTS AND THE COMMON MAN 1 N THE EIGHTEENTH century certain principles of enlightened common sense were thrown into formal shape and adopted by the civilized peoples of that time to govern the system of law and order , use and wont , under which they chose to live .

		So far as concerns economic relations the principles which so became incorporated into the system of civilized law and custom at that time were the principles of equal opportunity , self-determination , and self-help .

		Chief among the specific rights by which this civil - ized scheme of equal opportunity and self-help were to be safeguarded were the rights of free contract and security of property .

		These make up the sub - stantial core of that system of principles which is called the modern point of view , in so far as con - cerns trade , industry , investment , credit obligations , and whatever else may properly be spoken of as economic institutions .

		And these still stand over today as paramount among the inalienable rights of all free citizens in all free countries ; they are the groundwork of the economic system as it runs today , and this existing system can undergo no material change of character so long as these par - amount rights of civilized men continue to be inalienable .

		Any move to set these rights aside would be subversive of the modern economic order ; whereas no revision or alteration of established rights and usages will amount to a revolutionary movement so long as it does not disallow these paramount economic rights .

		When the constituent principles of the modern point of view were accepted and the modern scheme of civilized life was therewith endorsed by the civilized peoples , in the eighteenth century , these rights of self-direction and self-help were counted on as the particular and sufficient safeguard of equity and efficiency in any civilized country .

		They were counted on to establish eqvality among men in all their economic relations and to maintain the industrial system at the highest practicable degree of productive efficiency .

		They were counted on to give enduring effect to the rule of Live and Let Live .

		And such is still the value ascribed to these rights in the esteem of modern men .

		The main - tenance of law and order still means primarily and chiefly the maintenance of these rights of ownership and pecuniary obligation .

		But things have changed since that time in such a way that the rule of Live and Let Live is no longer sufficiently safeguarded by maintaining these rights in the shape given them in the eighteenth cen - tury or at least there are large sections of the people in these civilized countries who are beginning to think so , which is just as good for practical pur - poses .

		Things have changed in such a way , since that time , that the ownership of property in large holdings now controls the nation 's industry , and therefore controls the conditions of life for those who are or wish to be engaged in industry at the same time that the same ownership of large wealth controls the markets and thereby controls the con - ditions of life for those who have to resort to the markets to sell or buy .

		In other words , it has come to pass with the change of circumstances that the THE DIAL
January 25	DATE	rule of Live and Let Live how waits on the dis - cretion of the owners of large wealth .

		In fact , those thoughtful men in th - eighteenth century who made so much of these constituent principles of the mod - ern point of view did not contemplate anything like the system of large wealth , large-scale industry , and large-scale commerce and credit which prevails to - day .

		They did not foresee the new order in in - dustry and business , and the system of rights and obligations which they installed , therefore , made no provision for the new order of things that has come on since their time .

		The new order has brought the machine industry , corporation finance , big business , and the world market .

		Under this new order in business and in - dustry , business controls industry .

		Invested wealth in large holdings controls the country 's industrial system , directly by ownership of the plant , as in the mechanical industries , or indirectly through the market , as in farming .

		So that the population of these civilized countries now falls into two main classes : those who own wealth invested in large holdings and who thereby control the conditions of life for the rest ; and those who do not own wealth in sufficiently large holdings and whose conditions of life are therefore controlled by these others .

		It is a division , not between those who have something and those who have nothing as many socialists would be inclined to describe it but between those who own wealth enough to make it count , and those who do not .

		And all the while the scale on which the control of industry and the market is exercised goes on in - creasing ; from which it follows that what was large enough for assured independence yesterday is no longer large enough for tomorrow .

		Seen from an - other direction , it is at the same time a division be - tween those who live on free income and those who live by work a division between the kept classes and the underlying community from which their keep is drawn .

		It is sometimes spoken of in this bearing particularly by certain socialists as a di - vision between those who do no useful work and those who do ; but this would be a hasty generaliza - tion , since riot a few of those persons who have no assured free income also do no work that is of material use , as , for example , menial servants .

		But the gravest significance of this cleavage that so runs through the population of the advanced industrial countries lies in the fact that it is a division between the vested interests and the common man .

		It is a division between those who control the conditions of work and the rate and volume of output and to whom the net output of industry goes as free in - come , on the one hand , and those who have the work to do and to whom a livelihood is allowed by those in control , on the other hand .

		In point of numbers it is a very uneven division , of course .

		A vested interest is a legitimate right to get some - thing for nothing , usually a prescriptive right to an income which is secured by controlling the traffic at one point or another .

		The owners of such a pre - scriptive right are also spoken of as a vested in - terest .

		Such persons make up what are called the kept classes .

		But the kept classes also comprise many persons who are entitled to a free income on other grounds than their ownership and control of industry or the market , as , for example , landlords and other persons classed as `` gentry , '' the clergy , the Crown where there is a Crown and its officials , civil and military .

		Contrasted with these classes who make up the vested interests , and who derive an income from the established order of ownership and privilege , is the common man .

		He is common in the respect that he is not vested with such a pre - scriptive right to get something for nothing .

		And he is called common because such is the common lot of men under the new order of business and in - dustry ; and such will continue -LRB- increasingly -RRB- to be the common lot so long as the enlightened principles of secure ownership and self-help handed down from the ` eighteenth century continue to rule human af - fairs under the new order of industry .

		The kept classes , whose free income is secured to them by the legitimate rights of the vested interests , are less numerous than the common man less numerous by some ninty-five per cent or thereabouts and less serviceable to the community at large in perhaps the same proportion , so far as regards any conceivable use for any material purpose .

		In this sense they are uncommon .

		But it is not usual to speak of the kept classes as the uncommon classes , since they personally differ from the common run of mankind in no sensible respect .

		It is more usual to speak of them as `` the better classes , '' because they are in better circumstances and are better able to do as they like .

		Their place in the economic scheme of the civilized world is to consume the net product of the country 's industry over cost , and so prevent a glut of the market .

		But this broad distinction between the kept classes and their vested interests on the one side and the common man on the other side is by no means hard and fast .

		Doubtful cases are frequent , and a shift - ing across the line occurs now and again , but the broad distinction is not doubtful for all that .

		The great distinguishing mark of the common man is that he is helpless within the rules of the game as it is played in the twentieth century under the en -
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 77 lightened principles of the eighteenth century .

		There are all degrees of this helplessness that char - acterizes the common lot .

		So much so that certain classes , professions , and occupations such as the clergy , the military , the courts , police , and legal pro- fession are perhaps to be classed as belonging primarily with the vested interests , although they can scarcely be counted as vested interests in their own right , but rather as outlying and subsidiary vested interests whose security of tenure is con - ditioned on their serving the purposes of those prin - cipal and self-directing vested interests whose tenure rests immediately on large holdings of invested wealth .

		The income which goes to these subsidiary or dependent vested interests is of the nature of free income , in so far that it is drawn from the yearly product of the underlying community ; but in an - other sense it is scarcely to be counted as `` free '' income , in that its continuance depends on the good will of those controlling vested interests whose power rests on the ownership of large invested wealth .

		Still it will be found that these subsidiary or auxiliary vested interests uniformly range them - selves with their superiors in the same class , rather than with the common man .

		By sentiment and habitual outlook they belong with the kept classes , in that they are stanch defenders of that established order of law and custom which secures the great vested interests in power and insures the free income of the kept classes .

		In any twofold division of the population these are therefore , on the whole , to be ranged on the side of the old order , the vested in - terests , and the kept classes , both in sentiment and as regards the circumstances which condition their life and comfort .

		Beyond these , whose life interests are , after all , closely bound up with the kept classes , there are other vested interests of a more doubtful and per - plexing kind ; classes and occupations which would seem to belong with the common lot , but which range themselves at least provisionally with the vested in - terests and can scarcely be denied standing as such .

		Such , as an illustrative instance , is the
A. F.	PERSON	of L. Not that the constituency of the
A. F. of L.	ORGANIZATION	can be said to live on free income , and is therefore to be counted in with the kept classes the only reserva - tion on that head would conceivably be the corps of officials in the
A. F.	PERSON	of L. , who dominate the policies of that organization and exercise a prescriptive right to dispose of its forces , at the same time that they habitually come in for an income drawn from the underlying organization .

		The rank and file as - suredly are not of the kept classes , nor do they visibly come in for a free income .

		Yet they stand on the defensive in maintaining a vested interest in the prerogatives of their organization .

		They are apparently moved by a feeling that so long as the established arrangements are maintained they will come in for a little something over and above what would come to them if they were to make common cause with the undistinguished common lot .

		In other words , they have a vested interest in a narrow margin of preference over and above what goes to the common man .

		But this narrow margin of net gain over the common lot , this vested right to get a narrow margin of something for nothing , has hitherto been sufficient to shape their sentiments and outlook in such a way as , in effect , to keep them loyal to the large business interests with whom they negotiate for this narrow margin of preference .

		As is true of the vested interests in business , so in the case of the A. F. of L. , the ordinary ways and means of enforcing their claim to a little something over and above is the use of a reasonable sabotage , in the way of restriction , retardation , and unemploy - ment .

		Yet the constituency of the
A. F. of L.	ORGANIZATION	, taken man for man , is not readily to be distinguished from the common sort so far as regards their conditions of life .

		The spirit of vested interest which animates them may , in fact , be nothing more to the point than an aimless survival .

		Farther along the same line , larger and even more perplexing , is the case of the American farmers , who also are in the habit of ranging themselves , on the whole , with the vested interests rather than with the common man .

		By sentiment and outlook the farm - ers are , commonly , steady votaries of that established order which enables the vested interests to do a `` big business '' at their expense .

		Such is the tradition which still binds the farmers , however unequivo - cally their material circumstances under the new order of business and industry might seem to drive the other way .

		In the ordinary case the American farmer is now as helpless to control his own condi - tions of life as the commonest of the common run .

		He is caught between the vested interests who buy cheap and the vested interests who sell dear , and it is for him to take or leave what is offered but ordinarily to take it , on pain of `` getting leff There is still afloat among the rural population a slow-dying tradition of the `` Independent Farmer , '' , who is reputed once upon a time to have lived his own life and done his own work as good him seemed , and who was content to let the world wag .

		But all that has gone by as completely as the other things that are told in tales which begin with `` Once upon a time . ''

		It has gone by into the same waste of regrets with the like independence which the country-town retailer is believed to have enjoyed once upon a time .

		But the country-town retailer 7 8 THE DIAL
January 25	DATE	stands stiffly on the vested rights of the trade and of the town ; he is by sentiment and habitual outlook a business man who guides , or would like to guide , his enterprise by the principle of charging what the traffic will bear , of buying cheap and selling dear .

		He still manages to sell dear , but he does not com - monly buy cheap , except what he buys of the farmer , for the massive vested interests in the background now decide for him , in the main , how much his traffic will bear .

		He is not placed so very differently from the farmer in this respect , except that , being a middleman , he can in some appreciable degree shift the burden to a third party .

		The third party in the case is the farmer ; the massive vested interests who move in the background of the market do not lend themselves to that purpose .

		Except for the increasing number of tenant farm - ers , the American farmers of the large agricultural sections still are owners who cultivate their own ground .

		They are owners of property , who might be said to have an investment in their own farms , and therefore fancy that they have a vested interest in the farm and its earning-capacity .

		They have carried over out of the past and its old order of things a delusion to the effect that they have some - thing to lose .

		It is quite a natural and rather an engaging delusion , since , barring incumbrances , they are seised of a good and valid title at law , to a very tangible and useful form of property .

		And by due provision of law and custom they are quite free to use or abuse - their holdings in the land , to buy and sell it and its produce altogether at their own pleas - ure .

		It is small wonder if the farmers , with the genial traditions of the day before yesterday still running full and free in their sophisticated brains , are given to consider themselves typical holders of a legitimate vested interest of a very substantial kind .

		In all of which they count without their host ; their host , under the new order of business , being those massive vested interests that move obscurely in the background of the market , and whose rule of life it is to buy cheap and sell dear .

		In the ordinary case the farmers of the great American farming regions are owners of the land and improvements , except for an increasing propor - tion of tenant farmers .

		But it is the farmer-own -- that is commonly had in mind in speaking of the American farmers as a class .

		Barring incumbrances , these farmer-owners have a good and valid title to their land and improvements ; but their title remains good only so long as the run of the market for what they need and what they have to sell does not take such a turn that the title will pass by process of liquidation into other hands , as may always happen .

		And the run of the market which conditions the farmer 's work and livelihood has now come to de - pend on the highly impersonal maneuvers of those massive interests that move in the background and find a profit in buying cheap and selling dear .

		In point of law and custom there is , of course , nothing to hinder the American farmer from considering himself to be possessed of a vested interest in his farm and its working , if that pleases his fancy .

		The circumstances which decide what he may do with his farm and its equipment , however , are prescribed for him quite deliberately and quite narrowly by those other vested interests in the background that are massive enough to regulate the course of - things in business and industry at large .

		He is caught in the system , and he does not govern the set and mo - tions of the system .

		So that the question of his effectual standing as a vested interest becomes a question of fact , not of preference and genial tradition .

		A vested interest is a legitimate right to get some - thing for nothing .

		The American farmer say , the ordinary farmer of the grain-growing
Middle West	LOCATION	can be said to be possessed of such a vested interest only if he habitually and securely gets some - thing in the way of free income above cost , counting as cost the ordinary rate of wages for work done on the farm plus ordinary returns on the replacement value of the means of production which he employs .

		Now it is notorious that , except for quite exceptional cases , there are no intangible assets in farming ; and intangible assets are the chief and ordinary indication of free income , that is to say , of getting something for nothing .

		Any concern that can claim no in - tangible assets , in the way of valuable good-will , monopoly rights , or outstanding corporation securi - ties , has no claim to be rated as a vested interest .

		What constitutes a valid claim to standing as a vested interest is the assured customary ability to get something more in the way of income than a full equivalent for tangible performance in the way of productive work .

		The returns which these farmers are in the habit of getting from their own work and from the work of their household and hired help do not ordinarily include anything that can be called free or unearned income unless one should go so far as to declare that income reckoned at ordinary rates on the tangi - ble assets engaged in this industry is to be classed as unearned income , which is not the usual meaning of the expression .

		It may be that popular opinion on these matters will take such a turn some time that men will come to consider that income wm ` ch is derived from the use of land and equipment is rightly to be counted as unearned income , because it does not correspond to any tangible performance in
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 79 the way of productive work on the part of the person to whom it goes .

		But for the present that is not the popular sense of the matter , and that is not the meaning of the words in popular usage .

		For the present , at least , reasonable returns on the replace - ment value of tangible assets are not considered to be unearned income .

		It is true the habits of thought engendered by the machine system in industry and by the mechanically standardized organization of daily life under this new order , as well as by the material sciences , are of such a character as would incline the common man to rate all men and things in terms of tangible performance rather than in terms of legal title and ancient usage .

		And it may well come to pass , in time , that men will consider any income unearned which exceeds a fair return for tangible performance in the way of productive work on the part of the person to whom the income goes .

		The mechanistic logic of the new order of industry drives in that direction , and it may well be that the frame of mind engendered by this training in matter-of-fact ways of thinking will presently so shape popular sentiment that all income from property , simply on the basis of ownership , will be disallowed , whether the prop - erty is tangible or intangible .

		All that is a specula - tive question running into the future .

		It is to be recognized and taken account of that the immutable principles of law and equity , in matters of owner - ship and income as well as in other connections , are products of habit , and that habits are always liable to change in response to altered circumstances , and the drift of circumstances is now apparently setting in that direction .

		But popular sentiment has not yet reached that degree of emancipation from those good old principles of self-help and secure ownership that go to make up the modern -LRB- eighteenth century -RRB- point of view in law and custom .

		The equity of income derived from the use of tangible property may presently become a moot question ; but it is not so today , outside of certain classes in the population whom the law and the courts are endeavoring to discourage .

		It is the business of the law and the courts to discourage any change of insight or opinion .

		It appears , therefore , that his conditions of life should throw the American farmer in with the common man who has substantially nothing to lose , beyond what the vested interests of business can always take over at their own discretion and in their own good time .

		In point of material fact he has ceased to be a self - directing agent ; and self-help has for him come substantially to be a make-believe ; although , of course , in point of legal formality he still continues to enjoy all the ancient rights and immunities of secure ownership and self-help .

		Yet it is no less patent a fact of current history that the American farmer continues , on the whole , to stand fast by those principles of self-help and free bargaining which enable the vested interests to play fast and loose with him and all his works .

		Such is the force of habit and tradition .

		The reason , or at least the preconception , by force of which the American farmers have been led , in effect , to side with the vested interests rather than with the common man , comes of the fact that the farmers are not only farmers but also owners of speculative real estate .

		And it is as speculators in land values that they find themselves on the side of unearned income .

		As land-owners they aim and confidently hope to get something for nothing in the unearned increase of land values .

		But all the while they overlook the fact that the future in - crease of land values , on which they pin their hopes , is already discounted in the present price of the land except for exceptional and fortuitous cases .

		As is known to all persons who are at all informed on this topic , farmland holdings in the typical Amer - ican farming regions are overcapitalized , in the sense that the current market value of these farm - lands is considerably greater than the capitalized value of the income to be derived from their current use as farmlands .

		This excess value of the farm - lands is a speculative value due to discounting the future increased value which these lands are ex - pected to gain with the further growth of popula - tion and with increasing facilities for marketing the farm products of the locality .

		It is therefore as a land speculator holding his land for a rise , not as a husbandman cultivating the soil for a livelihood , that the prairie farmer , for example , comes in for an excess value and an overcapitalization of his holdings .

		All of which has much in common with the intangible assets of the vested interests , and all of which persuades the prairie farmer that he is of a class apart from the common man who has nothing to lose .

		But he can come in for this un - earned gain only by the eventual sale of his hold - ings , not in their current use as a means of produc - tion in farming .

		As a business man doing a specu - lative business in farmlands the American ' farmer , in a small way , runs true to form and so is entitled to a modest place among that class of substantial citizens who get something for nothing by cornering the supply and `` sitting tight . ''

		And all the while the massive interests that move obscurely in the background of the market are increasingly in a position , in their own good time , to disallow the farmer just so much of this stillborn gain as they may dispassionately consider to be convenient for 8o THE DIAL
January 25	DATE	their own use .

		And the farmer-speculator of the prairies continues to stand fast by the principles of equity which entitle the vested interests to play fast and loose with him and all his works .

		The facts of the case stand somewhat different as regards the American farmer 's gains from his work as a husbandman , or from the use which he makes of his land and stock in farming .

		His re - turns from his work are notably scant .

		So much so that it is still an open question whether , taken one with another , the American farmer 's assets in land and other equipment enable him , one year with another , to earn more than what would count as ordinary wages for the labor which these assets enable him to put into his product .

		But it is be - yond question that the common run of those Amer - ican farmers who `` work their own land '' get at the best a very modest return for the use of their land and stock so scant , indeed , that if usage admitted such an expression it would be fair to say that the farmer , considered as a going concern , should be credited with an appreciable item of `` negative intangible assets , '' such as habitually to reduce the net average return on his total active assets appreciably below the ordinary rate of dis - count .

		His case , in other words , is the reverse of the typical business concern of the larger sort , which conies in for a net excess over ordinary rates of discount on its tangible assets , and which is thereby enabled to write into its accounts a certain amount of intangible assets , and so come into line as a vested interest .

		The farmer , too , is caught in the net of the new order ; but his occupation does not belong to that new order of business enterprise in which earning-capacity habitually outruns the capitalized value of the underlying physical prop - erty .

		Evidently the cleavage due to be brought on by the new order in business and industry , between the vested interests and the common man , has not yet fallen into clear lines , at least not in
America	LOCATION	.

		The common man does not know himself as such , at least not yet , and the sections of the population which go to make up the common lot as contrasted with the vested interests have not yet learned to make common cause .

		The American tradition stands in the way .

		This tradition says that the people of the republic are made up of ungraded masterless men who enjoy all the rights and im - munities of self-direction , self-help , free bargaining , and equal opportunity , quite after the fashion that was sketched into the great constituent documents of the eighteenth century .

		Much doubt and some discontent is afoot .

		It is becoming increasingly evident that the facts of everyday life under the new order do not fall in with the inherited prin - ciples of law and custom ; but the farmers , farm laborers , factory hands , mine workmen , lumber hands , and retail tradesmen have not come to any - thing like a realization of the new order of economic life which throws them in together on one side of a line of division , on the other side of which stand the vested interests and the kept classes .

		They have not yet come to realize that all of them together have nothing to lose except such things as the vested interests can quite legally and legitimately deprive them of , with full sanction of law and custom as it runs , so soon and so far as it shall suit the convenience of the vested interests to make such a move .

		These people of the variegated mass have no safeguard , in fact , against the control of their conditions of life exercised by those massive inter - ests that move obscurely in the background of the market , except such considerations of expediency as may govern the maneuvers of those massive ones who so move obscurely in the background .

		That is to say , the conditions of life for the variegated mass are determined by what the traffic will bear , according to the calculations of self-help which guide the vested interests , all the while that the farmers , workmen , consumers , the common lot , are still animated with the fancy that they have them - selves something to say in these premises .

		It is otherwise with the vested interests , on the whole .

		They take a more perspicuous view of their own case and of the predicament of the common man , the party of the second part .

		Whereas the variegated mass that makes up the common lot have not hitherto deliberately taken sides together or defined their own attitude toward the established system of law and order and its continuance , and so are neither in the right nor in the wrong as regards this matter , the vested interests and the kept classes , on the other hand , have reached insight and definition of what they need , want , and are entitled to .

		They have deliberated and chosen their part in the division , partly by interest and partly by in - grained habitual bent , no doubt and they are al - ways in the right .

		They owe their position and the blessings that come of it free income and social prerogative to the continued enforcement of eighteenth century principles of law and order un - der conditions created by the twentieth century state of the industrial arts .

		Therefore it is in - cumbent on them , in point of expediency , to stand strongly for the established order of inalienable eighteenth century rights ; and they are at the same time in the right , in point of law and morals , in so doing , since what is right in law and morals is
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 81 always a question of settled habit , and settled habit is always a legacy out of the past .

		To take their own part , therefore , the vested interests and the kept classes have nothing more perplexing to do than simply to follow the leadings of their settled code in all questions of law and order and thereby to fall neatly in with the leading of their own pe - cuniary advantage , and always and on both counts to keep their poise as safe and sound citizens intelli - gently abiding by the good old principles of right and honest living which safeguard their vested rights .

		The common man is not so fortunate .

		He can not effectually take his own part in this difficult con - juncture of circumstances without getting on the wrong side of the established run of law and morals .

		Unless he is content to go on as the party of the second part in a traffic that is controlled by the mas - sive interests on the footing of what they consider that the traffic will bear , he will find himself in the wrong and may even come in for the comfortless attention of the courts .

		Whereas if he makes his peace with the established run of law and custom , and so continues to be rated as a good man and true , he will find that his livelihood falls into a dubious and increasingly precarious case .

		It is not for nothing that he is a common man .

		So caught in a quandary , it is small wonder if the common man is somewhat irresponsible and un - steady in his aims and conduct , so far as touches industrial affairs .

		A pious regard for the received code of right and honest living holds him to a sub - missive quietism , a make-believe of self-help and fair dealing , whereas the material and pecuniary circumstances that condition his livelihood under this new order drive him to fall back on the under - lying rule of Live and Let Live , and to revise the established code of law and custom to such purpose that the underlying rule of life shall be brought into bearing in point of fact as well as in point of legal formality .

		And the training to which the hard matter-of-fact logic of the machine industry and the mechanical organization of life now subjects him , constantly bends him to a matter-of-fact out - look , to a rating of men and things in terms of tangible performance , and to an ever slighter respect for the traditional principles that have come down from the
eighteenth century	DATE	.

		The common man is constantly and increasingly exposed to the risk of becoming an undesirable citizen in the eyes of the votaries of law and order .

		In other words , vested rights to free income are no longer felt to be secure in case the common man should take over the direc - tion of affairs .

		Such a vested right to free income , that is to say the legitimate right of the kept classes to their keep at the cost of the underlying community , does not fall in with the lines of that mechanistic outlook and mechanistic logic which is forever gaining ground as the new order of industry goes forward .

		Such free income , which measures neither the investor 's personal contribution to the production of goods nor his necessary consumption while engaged in industry , does not fit in with that mechanistic reckoning that runs in terms of tangible perform - ance , and that grows ever increasingly habitual and convincing with every further habituation to the new order of things in the industrial world .

		Vested perquisites have no place in the new scheme of things ; hence the new scheme is a menace .

		It is true , the well stabilized principles of the eighteenth century still continue to rate the investor as a pro- ducer of goods ; but it is equally true that such a rating is palpable nonsense according to the mechan - istic calculus of the new order brought into bearing by the mechanical industry and material science .

		This may all be an untoward and distasteful turn of circumstances , but there is no gain of tranquillity to be got from ignoring it .

		So it comes about that , increasingly , throughout broad classes in these industrial countries there is coming to be visible a lack of respect and affection for the vested interests , whether of business or of privilege ; and it rises to the pitch of distrust and plain disallowance among those on whom the pre - conceptions of the eighteenth century sit more lightly and loosely .

		It still is all vague and shifty so much so that the guardians of law and order are still per - suaded that they `` have the situation in hand . ''

		But the popular feeling of incongruity and uselessness in the current run of law and custom under the rule of these timeworn preconceptions is visibly gaining ground and gathering consistency , even in so well ordered a republic as
America	LOCATION	.

		A cleavage of senti - ment is beginning to run between the vested interests and the variegated mass of the common lot ; and increasingly the common man is growing apathetic , or even impervious , to appeals grounded on these timeworn preconceptions of equity and good usage .

		The fact of such a cleavage , as well as the existence of any ground for it , is painstakingly denied by the spokesmen of the vested interests ; and in support of that comfortable delusion they will cite the exem - plary fashion in which certain monopolistic labor organizations `` stand pat . ''

		It is true , such a quasi - vested interest as the
A. F. of L.	ORGANIZATION	, which unbidden assumes to speak for the common man , can doubtless be counted on to `` stand pat '' on that system of im - ponderables in which its vested perquisites reside .

		So also the kept classes , and their stewards among 82 THE DIAL
January	DATE	the keepers of law and custom , are inflexibly con - tent to let well enough alone .

		They can be counted on to see nothing more to the point than a stupidly subversive rapacity in that loosening of the bonds of convention that so makes light of the sacred rights of vested interest .

		Interested motives may count for something on both sides , but it is also true that the kept classes and the businesslike managers of the vested interests , whose place in the economy of na - ture it is to make money by conforming to the received law and custom , have not in the same de - gree undergone the shattering discipline of the New Order .

		They are , therefore , still to be found stand - ing blamelessly on the stable principles of the Mod - ern Point of View .

		But a large fraction of the people in the indus - trial countries is visibly growing uneasy under these principles as they work out under existing circum - stances .

		So , for example , it is evident that the common man within the
United Kingdom	LOCATION	, in so far as the
Labor Party	ORGANIZATION	is his accredited spokesman , is increasingly restive under the state of `` things as they are , '' and it is scarcely less evident that he finds his abiding grievance in the Vested Interests and that system of law and custom which cherishes them .

		And these men , as well as their like in other countries , are still in an unsettled state of advance to positions more definitely at variance with the received law and custom .

		In some instances , and indeed in more or less massive formation , this move - ment of dissent has already reached the limit of tolerance and has found itself sharply checked by the constituted keepers of law and custom .

		It is perhaps not unwarranted to count the
I. W. W.	PERSON	as such a vanguard of dissent , in spite of the slight consistency and the exuberance of its movements .

		After all , these and their like , here and in other countries , are an element of appre - ciable weight in the population .

		They are also increasingly numerous , in spite of well-conceived repressive measures , and they appear to grow in - creasingly sure .

		And it will not do to lose sight of the presumption that , while they may be gravely in the wrong , they are likely not to be far out of touch with the undistinguished mass of the common sort who still continue to live within the law .

		It should seem likely that the peculiar moral and in - tellectual bent which marks them as `` undesirable citizens '' will , all the while , be found to run closer to that of the common man than the corresponding bent of the law-abiding beneficiaries under the existing system .

		Vaguely , perhaps , and with a picturesque irre - sponsibility , these and their like are talking and thinking at cross-purposes with the principles of free bargain and self-help .

		There is reason to be - lieve that to their own thinking , when cast in the terms in which they conceive these things , their notions of reasonable human intercourse are not equally fantastic and inconclusive .

		So , there is the dread word ,
Syndicalism	ORGANIZATION	, which is quite properly unintelligible to the kept classes and the adepts of corporation finance , and which has no definable meaning within the constituent principles of the eighteenth century .

		But the notion of it seems to come easy , by mere lapse of habit , to these others in whom the discipline of the New Order has begun to displace the preconceptions of the eighteenth century .

		Then there are , in this country , the agrarian syndicalists , in the shape of the Nonpartisan League large , loose , animated , and untidy , but sure of itself in its settled disallowance of the Vested In - terests , and fast passing the limit of tolerance in its inattention to the timeworn principles of equity .

		How serious is the moral dereliction and the sub - versive stupidity of these agrarian syndicalists , in the eyes of those who still hold fast to the
eighteenth century	DATE	, may be gathered from the animation of the business community , the commercial clubs , the Rotarians , and the traveling salesmen , in any place where the
League	ORGANIZATION	raises its untidy head .

		And as if advisedly to complete the case , these agrarians , as well as their running-mates in the industrial centers and along the open road , are found to be slack in respect of their national spirit .

		So , at least , it is said by those who are interested to know .

		It is not that these and their like are ready with `` a satisfactory constructive program , '' such as the people of the uplift require to be shown before they will believe that things are due to change .

		It is something of a simpler and cruder sort , such as history is full of , to the effect that whenever and so far as the timeworn rules no longer fit the new material circumstances they presently fail to carry conviction as they once did .

		Such wear and tear of institutions is unavoidable where circumstances change ; and it is through the altered personal equa - tion of those elements of the population which are most directly exposed to the changing circumstances that the wear and tear of institutions may be ex - pected to take effect .

		To these untidy creatures of the New Order common honesty appears to mean vaguely something else , perhaps something more exacting , than what was `` nominated in the bond '' at the time when the free bargain and self-help were written into the moral constitution of
Christendom	LOCATION	by the handicraft industry and the petty trade .

		And why should it not ?

THORSTEIN VEBLEN	PERSON	.

		1919 THE DIAL The Literary Abbozzo A HE ITALIANS use the word abbozzo meaning a sketch or unfinished work not only in reference to drawing or painting but also as a sculptural term .

		The group of unfinished sculptures by
Michelangelo	ORGANIZATION	in
Florence	LOCATION	, for example , takes this name ; they are called simply abbozzi .

		The stone is still rough the conception has only just begun to appear ; it has not yet wholly or freely emerged .

		There is an im - pressiveness in the way in which the powerful figures seem struggling with the rock for release .

		And it is no wonder that
Rodin	PERSON	and others have seen in this particular stage of a piece of sculpture a hint for a new method based on the clear enough esthetic value of what might be called the provocatively incom - plete .

		Unfortunately , in literature as in sculpture , the vogue of the incomplete has become too general , and has in consequence attracted many who are without a clear understanding of its principles .

		Two mis - conceptions regarding it are particularly common : one , that it is relatively formless , and therefore eas - ier than a method more precise ; the other , that it is a universal style , applicable to any one of the whole gamut of themes .

		Neither of these notions , of course , is true .

		The literary abbozzo or to be more precise , the poetic abbozzo demands a high degree of skill , a very sure instinct .

		And it should be equally apparent that it is properly applicable to what is relatively only a small number of moods or themes among which one might place conspicuous - ly the dithyrambic and the enumerative .

		These are moods which irregularity will often save from mo - notony .

		Whitman 's catalogues would be even worse than they are had they been written as conscien - tiously in heroic couplets .

		The same is perhaps true of the dithyrambs of Ossian .

		Both poets to have been successful in a more skilfully elaborate style would have been compelled to delete a great deal ... which would no doubt have been an improvement .

		This makes one a little suspicious of the abbozzo : is it possible that we overrate it a trifle ?

		Might we not safely suggest to those artists whom we suspect of greatness , or even of very great skill merely , that their employment of the abbozzo should be chiefly as relaxation ?

		But they will hardly need to be told .

		The provocatively incomplete which is to be sharp - ly distinguished from the merely truncated or slov - enly has its charm , its beautiful suggestiveness ; but in proportion as the artist is powerful he will find the abbozzo insufficient , he will want to sub - stitute for this charm , this delicate hover , a beauty and strength more palpable .

		The charm which in - heres in the implied rather than the explicit he knows how to retain he will retain it in the dim counterpoint of thought itself .

		The poems of
Miss Lola Ridge	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- The Ghetto and Other Poems
Huebsch	PERSON	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB- raise all these issues sharply , no less because the author has rich - ness and originality of sensibility , and at times bril - liance of idea , than because she follows this now too common vogue .

		Here is a vivid personality , even a powerful one , clearly aware of the peculiar experience which is its own a not too frequent gift .

		It rejoices in the streaming and garishly lighted multiplicity of the city : it turns eagerly toward the semi-tropical fecundity of the meaner streets and tenement districts .

		Here it is the human item that most attracts Miss Ridge Jews , for the most part , seen darkly and warmly against a background of social consciousness , of rebelliousness even .

		She arranges her figures for us with a muscular force which seems masculine ; it is singular to come upon a book written by a woman in which vigor is so clearly a more natural quality than grace .

		This is sometimes merely strident , it is true .

		When she compares Time to a paralytic , `` A mildewed hulk above the nations squatting , '' one fails to respond .

		Nor is one moved precisely as Miss Ridge might hope when she tells us of a wind which `` noses among them like a skunk that roots about the heart . ''

		It is apparent from the frequency with which such falsities occur particularly in the section called Labor that
Miss Ridge	ORGANIZATION	is a trifle obsessed with the concern of being powerful : she forgets that the harsh is only harsh when used sparingly , the loud only loud when it emerges from the quiet .

		She is uncer - tain enough of herself to deal in harshnesses whole - sale and to scream them .

		But with due allowances made for these extrava - gances the extravagances of the brilliant but some - what too abounding amateur one must pay one 's respects to Miss Ridge for her very frequent verbal felicities , for her images brightly lighted , for a few shorter poems which are clusters of glittering phrases , and for the human richness of one longer poem , The Ghetto , in which the vigorous and the tender are admirably fused .

		Here Miss Ridge 's reactions are fullest and truest .

		Here she is under no compulsion to be strident .

		And it is precisely THE DIAL
January 25	DATE	because here she is relatively most successful that one is most awkwardly conscious of the defects inher - ent in the whole method for which Miss Ridge stands .

		This is a use of the `` provocatively incom - plete '' as concerns form in which , unfortunately , the provocative has been left out .

		If we consider again , for a moment ,
Michelangelo	ORGANIZATION	's abbozzi we become aware how slightly , by comparison ,
Miss Ridge	LOCATION	's figures have begun to emerge .

		Have they emerged enough to suggest the clear overtone of the thing completed ?

		The charm of the incomplete is of course in its positing of a norm which it suggests , approaches , retreats from , or at points actually touches .

		The ghost of completeness alternately shines and dims .

		But for Miss Ridge these subtle - ties of form do not come forward .

		She is content to use for the most part a direct prose , with only sel - dom an interpellation of the metrical , and the metri - cal of a not particularly skilful sort .

		The latent harmonies are never evoked .

		One hesitates to make suggestions .

		Miss Ridge might have to sacrifice too much vigor and richness to obtain a greater beauty of form : the effort might prove her undoing .

		By the degree of her success or failure in this undertaking , however , she would be - come aware of her real capacities as an artist .

		Or is she wise enough to know beforehand that the effort would be fruitless , and that she has already reached what is for her the right pitch ?

		That would be a confession but it would leave us , even so , a wide margin for gratitude .

		Artistry in style and method must not be asked of a book so conceived and born ; nor any sustained calmness of speech or judgment in contemporary reference .

		The book is not so much a scientific treatise as an extended polemical pamphlet , almost a diatribe but it would have taken a bloodless man to write with frigid impartiality in the midst of war-mad foes .

		What most stirs Dr.

Junker	PERSON	scribes that war is biologically natural , inevitable , and desirable .

		It might be one or another of these : but to argue for all three is to fall on the other side of the truth .

		Of course the fact in this matter eludes absolute statement and lurks among distinc - tions .

		If war mean merely individual fighting , it is natural enough , and conceivably desirable as an occasional relief from `` law and order '' ; if war mean fighting between two groups of the one species , then war is an unnatural , exceptional thing in the animal world , being popular only among ants and men .

		Almost throughout nature struggle is with environ - mental obstruction rather than within the species : .

		the teeth and claws of the tiger are for other species , not for other tigers .

		Struggle within the species is indirect : the best equipped ` for getting food and fighting other species survive ; the worst equipped succumb .

		Struggle is natural , but war is human .

		`` There is nothing natural , nothing great , nothing noble about war ; it is merely one of the numberless consequences of the introduction of private prop - erty . ''

		Hence the ants , which accumulate property , also know the arts of slavery and war .

		It is less than half a truth , too , that war is naturally based in the pugnacity of the `` herd '' -LRB-
Trotter	ORGANIZATION	's view -RRB- .

		It is clear enough that we love our families and our homes , and are by native dis - position ready to fight for them ; it is not clear that we are by nature disposed to fight for 60,000,000 people whom we have never seen .

		We must be taught that these three score millions are to be fought for , and that these others over the border are `` natural '' food for our powder .

		It is true that we are born with a disposition to fight for our goods ; it is not true that we are born with a disposi - tion to fight to protect the goods of others .

		We have to be taught that the goods of others are -LRB- only for the passing purpose -RRB- our own .

		If we were born THE DIAI with a disposition to fight for other people 's goods , and for people whom we have never seen , we would have fought without urging for the wage-slaves of Lawrence and the slaughtered serfs of
Colorado	LOCATION	.

		Without urging we would not do it .

		And it is not otherwise with war : a thousand reams of print and a thousand reels of film must stretch our little pugnacities to the mighty scope of war .

		And so those who , like
Freud	PERSON	and
Jones	PERSON	, reduce war to `` unconscious '' motivation , miss the center of the fact .

		These unconscious sources will suffice to pro- duce a scrimmage on the campus or a quarrel in the streets ; but war calls for conscious organization , stimulation and direction , and its sources are to be found rather in the minority that stimulates and organizes and directs than in the really gentle mob that fights and dies or lives to pay .

		Hence , finally , the error of those who -LRB- like our author -RRB- think to destroy war by proving it financially injurious to the victorious nation .

		War will go merrily on , genera - tion after generation , so long as it may seem profitable to the minority that chances to be in power and in the present structure and complexity of states it is always a minority that wields the power .

		Therefore democracy , if it is democracy , does in some modest measure make for peace ; for to distribute power is to decrease the individual share in the spoils , and so to lessen the temptations that call to arms .

		But the biologs of wars are not so easily routed .

		Surely war weeds out the unfit , and aptly serves selection .

		So far as `` the unfit '' means individuals , the argument is among the casualties of the war .

		It is the `` unfit '' that have survived to increase and multiply ; it is the `` fit '' whose clear flame has been snuffed out in the painless ecstasy of battle .

		`` The blind , deaf and dumb , idiots , hunchbacks , scrofulous and impotent persons , imbeciles , paralytics , epilep - tics , dwarfs , and abortions all these ... can stay at home and dress their ulcers while the brave , strong young men are rotting on the battle-field . ''

		So far as `` the unfit '' are groups and institutions , the argument has better ground ; it was this , no doubt , that
Heraclitus	PERSON	,
Carlyle	PERSON	of
Ephesus	LOCATION	, had in mind when he declared that `` war is the father of all things . ''

		But it is as clear as a day in
June	DATE	that the fitness by which institutions and groups are selected in war is not fitness in general but fitness merely for war .

		And in this process of elimination and survival many groups and institutions may be selected which for vital purposes other than war are not as obviously `` fit '' as they might be : auto - cratic class-structures , for example , and the coercive state , and collective conceit , and a tongued-tied press , and the subtly poisoned wells of public thought .

		Selection might conceivably proceed by economic competition -LRB- as now , to some degree , within the state -RRB- rather than by ordeal of battle ; and there are some who believe that the last ordeal would not have come had economic competition been left quite free .

		When selection by war replaces selec - tion by economic ability , premium and incentive are taken from the creative capacities of production and placed upon the disruptive faculties of competitive destruction .

		The trouble with war is not that it is a dangerous struggle there were more deaths by infantile disease in
England	LOCATION	during the first year of the war than by bjattle on the English front but that it is a foolish one , unfair and unproductive of anything but further war .

		The bald truth of the matter , of course , is that the biological argument for war is an afterthought , an effort some have made to conceal economic privilege jn the decent drapery of science , as others have tried to cover it with idealistic gloss .

		A victorious Ger - many would have withdrawn the drapery and shown us a
Belgium	LOCATION	conquered and a middle
Europe	LOCATION	ab - sorbed and feudalized ; a victorious
England	LOCATION	frankly forgets that she fought for `` the rights of small nations , '' and prepares to add some unwilling col - onies to her vast collection .


Germany	LOCATION	is learning the lesson of this deceit ; victory may blind us to it .


Germany	LOCATION	began with
Bernhardi	PERSON	, and ends with
Nicolai	PERSON	; we began with
Nicolai	PERSON	, and seem resolved to end with
Bernhardi	PERSON	.

		Nicolai appeals to Ger - many to think internationally ; one wonders will she be permitted .

		Apparently , if the imperialistic bloc that signed the Pact of
London	LOCATION	on
September 5 , 1914	DATE	maintains ascendancy at
Paris	LOCATION	, the nations that have lost this war for democracy and against militarism will have won it , and the nations that have won it will have lost it .

		The Allies have given freedom to
Germany	LOCATION	, and seem willing to accept Prussianism in return .

		One is reminded of the story -LRB- source forgotten -RRB- of the Dukhobor who , forgetting the geographical variability of morals , tried to go naked in ' the streets of
London	LOCATION	.

		A policeman set out gravely to capture him , but found himself distanced because of his heavy clothing .

		Therefore he divested himself , as he ran , of garment after garment , until he was naked : and so lightened caught his prey .

		But then it was impossible to tell which was the Dukhobor and which was the policeman .

		86 THE DIAL
January 25	DATE	An American Pendennis IHE CHANCES for the great American novel grow fewer and fewer .

		The novels which we regard as characteristic of
England	LOCATION	, or
France	LOCATION	, or
Spain	LOCATION	were written when the social classes of those countries were still in the stratified contact prescribed by feudalism , or when it could be truthfully said that certain of these classes did not count .

		If these characteristic and circumscriptive novels had not been written , it is safe to say that we should forever lack them .

		The American novel delayed its advent beyond the time when our life was simple and homo - geneous , until its program has become too ambitious for fulfilment .

		American novelists have chosen to work within sectional limits or class limits : where they have attempted to transcend the boundaries alike of locality and class they have merely illus - trated the magnitude of their task without perform - ing it .

		The great American novel must remain a goal to be approximated , not attained .

		But though this be true , the approach to the American novel will continue to intrigue us in no book of the past year more subtly than in Mr.
Booth Tarkington	PERSON	's The Magnificent Ambersons -LRB-
Doubleday	ORGANIZATION	, Page ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- .

		The primary demand that the American novel shall give us the specific quality of American life , not in its local manifesta - tions and dialect but in its general bearing and language , is here eminently fulfilled .

		The scene of the story is clearly the
Middle West	LOCATION	, and the atmosphere is that of a newly arrived city , Indian - apolis , or
Cleveland	LOCATION	, or
Omaha	LOCATION	; but the spiritual values are no less current in
Boston	LOCATION	, or
Atlanta	LOCATION	, or
San Francisco	LOCATION	in short they are American .

		The limitation that it is a class novel is balanced by the fact that it is the typically American class which is presented the class which incarnates the American ideal and to which all good Americans aspire .

		And its period is that of the flowering of American civil - ization after the Civil War , the last truly American period before foreign influence set in with the World 's Fair .

		How total is Mr.
Tarkington	PERSON	's recall of the American Biedermeyer period is evident in the pages of his mise en scene .

		It was the period when elegance of personal appearance was believed to rest more upon the texture of garments than upon their shaping .

		`` A silk dress ... remained distinguished by merely remaining silk . ''

		He re - mjinds us of the stovepipe hat , in which `` without self-consciousness men went rowing '' ; and `` the long contagion of the Derby , '' of which the crown varied from a bucket to a spoon ; and of the `` Side-burns that found nourishment upon youthful profiles . ''

		He notes with uncanny precision the architectural arrangements of the houses , just beginning to boast the bathroom , in which `` the American plumber joke was planted '' ; the domestic service , at wages of two to
three dollars	MONEY	a week ; the horse cars which would wait for a lady who whistled from an up - stairs window , `` while she shut the window , put oh her hat and cloak , went downstairs , found an um - brella , told the girl what to have for dinner , and came forth from the house . ''

		He recalls the habit of serenading with such songs as Silver Threads Among the Gold , and
Kathleen Mavourneen	PERSON	; the sports , croquet and archery , with euchre for indoors ; and the esthetic movement .

		He delights us with the brilliant slang of the period when `` Does your mother know you 're out ? ''

		was a mild insult , and the conventional repartee to `` Pull down your vest , '' was `` Wipe off your chin . ''

		In this period Major
Amberson	PERSON	built
Amberson Addition	ORGANIZATION	, the local
Versailles	LOCATION	, with cast-iron statues at the intersections of the streets
Minerva	LOCATION	, Mer - cury , Gladiator ,
Emperor Augustus	PERSON	, Wounded
Doe	PERSON	and in the center the
Amberson Mansion	ORGANIZATION	on a four-acre lot , with sixty thousand dollars ' worth of black walnut woodwork inside .

		The Addition is a symbol of the magnificence of the Ambersons and of their period .

		Its decay marks the destructive progress of the American city with its waste , mean - ness , and squalor .

		The last view of
Amberson	ORGANIZATION	Ad - dition has a grotesque pathos which we all recognize : Other houses had become boarding-houses ... One having torn out part of an old stone-trimmed bay window for purposes of commercial display , showed two sus - pended petticoats and a pair of oyster-coloured flannel trousers to prove the claims of its black-and-gilt sign : `` French Cleaning and
Dye House	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Its next neighbour also sported a remodelled front and permitted no doubt that its mission in life was to attend cosily upon death : ``
J. M. Rolsener	PERSON	, Caskets .

		The Funeral Home . ''

		And beyond that , a plain old honest four-square gray-painted brick house was flamboyantly decorated with a great gilt scroll on the railing of the old-fashioned veranda : `` Mutual Benev ' t Order Cavaliers and Dames of Purity . ''

		The combination of characters embodies the typical American family group with external ma - terial for complications of the purely American variety .

		There is young
George	PERSON	, his grandfather ,
Major Amberson	PERSON	, his mother and her consort of the inferior Minafer clan , his uncles , the congress - man and the would-be ambassador , his aunt - Fanny on the Minafer side ; and challenging the magnifi - cence of the Ambersons there are
Eugene Morgan	PERSON	, the wanderer returning to the scenes of his youth with his strange belief in horseless carriages , and
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 87
Lucy	PERSON	, his daughter .

		There are materials for two romances in two generations , which Mr.
Tarkington	PERSON	develops with his usual enthusiasm for youth and tenderness for middle age .

		But the real love of the book is that of
Isabel Minafer	PERSON	for her son
George	PERSON	.


George Amberson Minafer	PERSON	is the product of the magnificence of the Ambersons and the love of his mother .

		He lives with intolerable egoism in the world which these have created for him .

		He is the aristocratic tough boy , who in his
Fauntleroy	PERSON	suit and brown curls fights the street boys and tells the minister to go to hell .

		Later he drives furiously through the streets of his native town to the exasper - ation and danger of its citizens .

		He insults his guests , scorns his father , bullies his aunt .

		He completes the climax when he interferes brutally to blight the second blooming romance of his mother .

		Yet in all this
George	PERSON	is but the victim of the dead hand of the former generation .

		His mother 's love is as a congenital ailment which leaves him incom - plete .


George Minafer	PERSON	is in fact a moral idiot ; in destroying his mother 's romance he wrecks his own .

		There is something very powerful in Mr.
Tarking	PERSON	- ton 's working out of this theme the love of
Isabel Minafer	PERSON	for her son is really a monstrous paradox but it is clothed in a garb so usual , so domestic , that we do not recognize - it for what it is .

		It is the fate of Greek tragedy in an American home .

		It is this sense that
George	PERSON	is a victim and not morally responsible which occurs again and again just in time to keep the reader from renouncing him utterly as a cur and a cad .

		It is this that justifies his redemption .

		Here Mr.
Tarkington	PERSON	's hand is less sure than in the downward movement of his story , and the result less convincing .

		We have to take
George	PERSON	's regeneration by virtue of the purging power of enforced renunciation , of poverty and work , largely on faith .

		Our confidence in the telepathic machinery by which the reconciliation of
George	PERSON	and the Morgans is brought about is im - perfect .

		This machinery , however , is to be taken in part symbolically .

		It represents the love of
Isabel Minafer	ORGANIZATION	still watching over and protecting her son .

		Once again we have an old and dignified theme , this time the theme of atonement , wrought into the common stuff of American life , but so subtly that we are hardly aware of it .

		The love of Isabel nearly ruined her son ; but in some mysterious way the spiritual value of it is not lost , and in the end it becomes his salvation .

		This solution gives the final touch of American quality to Mr.
Tarkington	PERSON	's novel .

		It is not with him merely a matter of crude optimism or of pro- viding the novel reader 's satisfaction .

		It is rather an assessment of life values in which the world ap - pears to
America	LOCATION	.

		Readers of
the Education of Henry Adams	ORGANIZATION	will remember his question `` The woman had once been supreme why was she un - known in
America	LOCATION	? ''

		Mr.
Tarkington	PERSON	's novel gives one answer .

		Sex in one form is prepotent in
America	LOCATION	.

		`` An
American Virgin	ORGANIZATION	would never dare command , '' says
Adams	PERSON	.

		True , but an American mother in her subjection is stronger than the Virgin on her throne .

		It is to Mr.
Tarkington	PERSON	's credit as an artist that he fits this theme perfectly into the American setting and handles it with reserve and proportion , in good faith and without cynicism .

		His method is disarmingly simple and his touch gentle , with the good nature that in
America	LOCATION	takes the place of urbanity .

		Above all , he ' gives us spiritual values according to American standards , and pro- fesses his own artistic belief in them .

		Empty Balloons A FEW OF THE Victorian letter writers , at their best , are the best .

		Fitzgerald , for instance ; often
Rossetti	PERSON	; and somewhat less often ,
Morris	PERSON	.

		More - over they were all almost unimaginably voluminous .

		-LRB- So the field was white for the reapers , and indefat - igably has it been reaped .

		Even now we occasion - ally get a new collection with power to charm .

		Even when , as in a recent volume which dealt with the sculptor
Woolner	PERSON	, the letters center about some wholly second-rate figure they occasionally give side - lights that are marvelously revealing .

		Darwin , wishful to know from a careful student of nude models how far down he had ever seen a blush extend , repays for a hundred pages of common - place .

		But most of the collections of these Victorian letters are stodge .

		They lie upon the readers with a weight heavy as frost .

		Often the letters are signed by great names , but even the signature of a
Pickwick	ORGANIZATION	lends no thrill to chops and tomato sauce .

		When they foreshadow publication , as they often do , they have the dullness of a rehearsal ; they lack the inspi - rational realization of an actual audience .

		Why were the Victorians , or so many of them , so dull off the platform of their public appearance ?

		To ridicule their set performances is in itself ridicu -
88	DATE	THE DIAL

		Tennyson , for all his sentimentality , will last in the grateful memory of men till melody no longer charms the ear .

		We did hear his voice , far above singing ; we hear it still .

		The world is full of clever women nowadays , but the Mill on the Floss remains serenely above their competition .

		Ruskin and Mat - thew
Arnold	LOCATION	, according to Professor
Phelps	PERSON	in The Pure Gold of
Nineteenth Century Literature	ORGANIZATION	, are pyrites ; but careful smelting seems still to reward many readers of their articles .

		But oh the letters of
Tennyson	LOCATION	and
George Eliot	PERSON	and
Ruskin	PERSON	and Arnold !

		Solemn or playful , they are equally ponderous .

		The Victorians were like great balloons .

		In pub - lic they were rilled with purpose .

		That purpose buoyed them up and carried them soaring .

		In pri - vate life they seem to have become somehow de - flated , and in consequence lax and flabby of thought .

		And this laxity and flabbiness appears in their cor - respondence .

		Their letters are neither natural and friendly , like
Fitzgerald	PERSON	's , nor vivid and powerful , like
Emerson	PERSON	's ; merely dull .

		In this sad world one demands either to be in - formed , or to be inspired , or to be diverted .

		Grant - ing for the sake of the argument that the English letter-writers seldom inspire the reader , may one further inquire why they so seldom divert ?

		Are the English really not a humorous people , such as Lord
Bryce	PERSON	in his well-known analysis of Americans declares us to be ?

		Certainly Bairnsf ather is humor - ous but then Bairnsf ather is Scotch , is he not ?

		Wells is humorous but then
Wells	ORGANIZATION	is Wells .

		But how about
Charlie Chaplin	PERSON	?

		No , the charge fails .

		And there are few Americans who will not admit the immense superiority of Punch to Life , provided they have read both publications , or even provided they have read Life only .

		And yet Punch is always self-conscious , and usually pompous ; can humor be pompous and self-conscious ?

		These are not profound speculations .

		But then , the volumes that educed them Correspondence of Sir
Arthur Helps	PERSON	, Edited by

Bertram Christian	PERSON	-LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead	LOCATION	;
$ 4	MONEY	-RRB- are not very profound , either , although in both cases the attitude of the editors might fairly be called reverential .

		The correspond - ence of Sir
Arthur Helps	PERSON	is edited by his son .

		Sir
Arthur	PERSON	was Clerk of the
Privy Council	ORGANIZATION	of
England	LOCATION	; had the honor of editing the
Prince Consort	ORGANIZATION	's Speeches and Addresses and the Queen 's Leaves from the Journal of Our Life in the
Highlands	LOCATION	; wrote many volumes , including fiction , all forgotten now , but in their day highly praised by Helps ' many friends .

		Helps died in
1875	DATE	.

		The letters include both his own and many writ - ten to him .

		His own letters are , as
Carlyle	LOCATION	re - marked of his writing in general , mild and lucent .

		They deal mostly with the abstractions of political and social reform .

		Infrequently Helps comments on people he meets , Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	for instance , of whom he says , `` She seems to me a ladylike , very sen - sible , unassuming person . ''

		The description does not badly fit Sir
Arthur	PERSON	.

		Of the letters he received , the most numerous are from
Ruskin	PERSON	and
Carlyle	LOCATION	.


Ruskin	PERSON	and
Carlyle	PERSON	appear not infrequently also in the other volume letters written to Mrs. Drew .

		She was
Mary Gladstone	PERSON	, third daughter of Wil -
liam E. Gladstone	PERSON	.

		As the letters in the Helps col - lection run to
1875	DATE	, and those in the Drew collection from
1878	DATE	to
1913	DATE	, one might naturally conclude that the two volumes taken together would give a sort of consecutive general view of
England	LOCATION	for the sixty years or so preceding the war .

		No conclusion could be more erroneous .

		Consecutiveness of im - pression is entirely lacking even the consecutive - ness of the kaleidoscope , which at least falls into pat - terns .

		Ruskin ,
Burne	PERSON	-
Jones	PERSON	, and
George Wyndham	PERSON	are the only individuals in the volume whose char - acters stand out in any relief .

		Of these
Ruskin	PERSON	unfortunately is made to appear unpardonably silly .

		Of course , he was an old man writing to a young girl ; the years had battered him , and his indignations had weakened his mentality ; yet these were the years of
Praeterita	LOCATION	, and the mushy futility of
Ruskin	ORGANIZATION	's letters in this volume we really ought to have been spared .

		Burne-Jones ' letters are quite another matter .

		A letter from him on the threatened restoration of
St. Mark 's Cathedral	ORGANIZATION	in
Venice	LOCATION	is nearer to vigor than anything else in the whole languid book ; and his industry , his kindliness , and his melancholy are all made plain .

		But easily the most attractive figure of them all is Wyndham 's .

		An utter aristocrat , he prayed from the bottom of his heart for the welfare of the people , in whose capacity to manage themselves he was never able to believe ; a cultivated and fastidious gentleman , he loved above all things directness , strength , and vigor ; he never cherished an animosity , never for - got a favor , and never made a dull speech .

		But even he has written some dull letters which the editor faithfully includes .

		Some
Hawarden Letters	ORGANIZATION	is attractively illus - trated , including a photograph of Mrs. DreW 's mar - riage certificate , with the signatures of
Edward VII	ORGANIZATION	and
George	PERSON	V as witnesses .

		Somehow this particu - lar illustration seems to epitomize the volume .

		OW MUCH LONGER WILL THE AMERICAN PUBLIC endure our shameful intervention in
Russia	LOCATION	?

		How much longer are we to permit our troops , enlisted under a democratic banner , to be used as pawns in the imperialistic political game which the Allies have been and are now openly playing in that country ?

		We have no hesitation in asking these questions , for the truth is that if our Government does not see fit soon to put a stop to this anti-American adventure , the American people will put a stop to it themselves .

		We have already endured too many mistakes in our Russian policy quietly to endure many more .

		The most recent incident in that policy the mishandling of the communication from the British Government by our
State Department	ORGANIZATION	shows how little our officials are to be entrusted with the formulation of any democratic foreign policy , when left unchecked or uncriticized .

		The British note proposed recogni - tion , at least tacitly , of the Soviet Government in
Russia	LOCATION	, and representation of that
Government	ORGANIZATION	at the
Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	.

		Yet incredible as it may seem , this proposal of supreme importance appar - ently did not even reach the eyes of Acting Secretary of State
Frank L. Polk	PERSON	until after the publication of
M. Pichon	PERSON	's statement in
Paris	LOCATION	rejecting the proposal in the name of
France	LOCATION	.

		Needless to add , the proposal was not communicated to the President in
Paris	LOCATION	, and if newspaper dispatches report cor - rectly , our peace delegates there were as much astonished as the general public at the revelation that the proposal had been made .

		This is only one incident among many where important documents , either through malice or through ignorance , have been lost somewhere in the red tape of the
State Department	ORGANIZATION	so that they have never reached the people who ought first to have seen them .

		All the evidence goes to show that our
State Department	ORGANIZATION	is an example of monumental inefficiency .

		This recent incident is appalling enough to make people lose all confidence in its method of handling our foreign , and especially our Russian , policy .

		We have no doubt that had President
Wilson	PERSON	been informed of those important developments in the situation of which he ought to have been informed , he would today be the advocate of a simple and direct and democratic Russian policy instead of being , as he is , obviously embarrassed by a policy which is personally distasteful to him a policy , moreover , which is thoroughly ambiguous .

		But we have conclusive evi - dence that the President has never been so informed until it has become too late .

		We may here point out that
Lloyd George	PERSON	has been forced to change his attitude toward the Soviet Government in
Russia	LOCATION	by the rising anger and protest of the British people .

		For us also but one Corrective force remains the force of a united and angered public opinion .

		It must be made clear to our
Government	ORGANIZATION	and to the President that the lives of our men in
Russia	LOCATION	are not a matter of negligible importance .

		It must be made clear that we entered this war to crush German militarism , and that with this task accomplished , we are not interes!ed in acting as the bond collectors for any
European Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		It must be made clear that we are disgusted and ashamed at the campaign of falsehood and misrepresentation about
Russia	LOCATION	which our
Government	ORGANIZATION	has seen fit to allow .

		It must be made clear that our Government is the servant and not the master of the American people .

		It is for the people and not for a small autocratic clique to say whether our men are to remain in
Russia	LOCATION	killing Russian peasants and workingmen .

		As the New Statesman succinctly says of English policy in its issue of
December 21	DATE	: What we now seem to be drifting into is a war against a
Government	ORGANIZATION	which now commands the allegiance of the mass of the Russian people , a war which , whatever it may be in theory , would in effect inevitably prove to be a war on behalf of a small monarchist class .

		However certain we may be that the
Bolsheviks	PERSON	' experiment in `` catastrophic Socialism '' will fail , it is not our business to stop it .

		We may watch it with interest , or we may contemptuously say that we will `` leave
Russia	LOCATION	to stew in her own juice . ''

		But we have neither the duty nor even the right to suppress it merely because we dislike it and to kill British soldiers in the operation .

		It is the duty of every American to infbrm himself of the real situation .

		Already there has been organ - ized a
Truth About Russia Society	ORGANIZATION	, composed en - tirely of patriotic Americans , for the purpose of giving the public the established and undisputed facts .

		Everyone should join this organization .

		Everyone should help in the arrangements for mass meetings , in the circulation of petitions .

		Everyone should write or telegraph his representatives at
Washington	LOCATION	.

		This type of legitimate pressure upon our elected representatives should not be relinquished until there is no mistaking the will of the American people or their temper .

		90 THE DIAL
January 25 1	DATE	HE PEACE CONFERENCE is CONFRONTED BY four groups of questions : penological , territorial , commercial , and social .

		Of these the first three are most interesting to the type of mind of members of the Conference ; but while they are in the fore - ground , the social situation enforced by the challenge of Bolshevism must be latent in every discussion .

		It is this situation which makes the all-inclusive and transcending problem of the Conference the question whether it can make peace at all , whether the ele - ments in control of the dominant nations can so harmonize their penological , political , and commer - cial interests that the fabric of international relations can be restored .

		For if they fail if they can not end war and the menace of it the present civiliza - tion is doomed .

		Now the restoration of the inter - national fabric is brought within bounds of possi - bility by the proposed
League of Free Nations	ORGANIZATION	.

		There has been much discussion as to whether its establishment should be given priority over other matters , or be relegated to the background , to be taken up after territorial claims and financial penal - ties have been adjusted .

		Such postponement , how - ever , was promptly seen to imply that the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	would be dealt with perfunctorily , half - heartedly , and skeptically ; at beist it would b.e a vague union , valuable chiefly as a preliminary sketch of what good intentions might accomplish if backed by an authority that would in all probability be lack - ing ; at worst it would be a
Holy Alliance	ORGANIZATION	designed to insure the permanence of such arrangements , territorial and commercial , as the dominant powers might impose .

		Only if the establishment of the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	be given priority is there much chance of its becoming an effective power in the world .

		Those who regard the League as the pri - mary object ' of the Conference will probably not have the strength to secure this priority of considera - tion , but the territorial and commercial questions are so complicated and difficult that it may prove that the sponsors of this or that claim or policy may be driven to support the priority of the
League	ORGANIZATION	, as the only possible means of securing progress .

		It is com - ing to be perceived that only by renunciation is any political settlement of the world possible .

		The Central Powers have already been notified pretty clearly of the sacrifices expected of them ; the ringer of the world is pointed at grasping
Italy	LOCATION	;
Poland	LOCATION	,
Roumania	PERSON	and the New Slavic States will be called upon to modify their demands .

		Nothing would advance the settlement so much as the inclusion of
Ireland	LOCATION	,
Egypt	LOCATION	,
India	LOCATION	, and
the Philippines	LOCATION	under the formula of self-determination .

		Now the
League	ORGANIZATION	, truly conceived , represents essentially just this idea of renunciation it undertakes to insure that sacri - fice of sovereignty or possession shall not mean loss of safety or prosperity .

		It is evident that the League , if it were already in existence , would sim - plify enormously the problems of settlement by pro- viding machinery and safeguards for their solution .

		It is , therefore , possible that the urgent need will result in the creation of the instrument .

		And it is further possible that through the League such a sys - tem of political and commercial readjustments throughout the world may be reached that the social question may be kept in the background , and left to be answered by the nations individually , under the aegis of self-determination .

		The connec - tion between the social situation and political policy in the minds of the diplomats who compose the
Conference	ORGANIZATION	is obvious .

		It is the pressure of social unrest that is impelling certain nations to demand the uttermost fruits of victory in territory and in - demnity .

		But only the blindest fail to see that extreme demands enforced against one nation will make that nation a home for the anarchy which is a menace to all .

		And only the dullest imagine that the people of any nation will support the strain of continued preparedness for a war made inevitable by a peace of conquest .

		To put it plainly , the funda - mental necessity for a better world is a great sacrifice of the instinct for possession .

		If the Peace Confer - ence can arrange a plan under which this sacrifice is made primarily b , y the existing nations , through a generous arrangement of their political and com - mercial relations , then we may look with some confi - dence toward a relatively peaceful social readjust - ment within their borders .

		But if this plan fails if the predatory instincts sway the Conference to con - cern itself chiefly with demands for territory , in - demnity , and commercial privilege on the part of the victors then , indeed , the rulers of the world will have proved once more their unfitness , and this time the people can not be deceived .

		It will then be cer - tain that no beneficent world order can come out of societies which are based on the possessive instincts of mankind .

		To deny priority to the
League	ORGANIZATION	is to grant it to the Revolution .

		The choice is before the Conference a peace of generosity , self-denial , and good will or anarchy .

		THE PROGRAM OF THE NEW SCHOOL FOR SOCIAL Research marks two departures from the conven - tional academic attitude toward the social sciences .

		One is in the direction of realism in education an application of principles as old as
Comenius	ORGANIZATION	.

		The object of the school will be to give properly qualified and earnest men and women , whether they have had an academic education or not , an opportunity to carry on serious and profitable advanced research in the fields of government and social organization .

		Here they may not only study the actual conditions and follow the changes which are constantly taking place in our dynamic society , but they will be enabled to see our present dif - ficulties in the light of scientific , philosophic , and his - torical knowledge .

		Hitherto there has commonly been a fatal gap between so-called theory and practice .

		It is the chief business of the new school to bridge this gap ; for all intelligent practice is based on theory , and all theories that are calculated to aid reform are nothing but , broad and critical ways of viewing practice .

		The other is in the direction of simplifying
1919	DATE	9 1 academic machinery and releasing both students and teachers from the regimentation which is the basis of academic organization and hierarchy .

		Of the students the program has this to say : The regular students will be presumed to be in the school to carry on each for himself his own chosen work with the help of the men and books which are put at his disposal .

		In every case each of them will have his special line of outside investigation into the social and economic and political phenomena of the world in which we live .

		This line he will be pursuing , regardless of terms and lectures , with such persistence as his energy permits .

		Informal discussion , reading , individual pondering , and above all a constant anxiety to get a first hand acquaint - ance with what is actually going on , will be the main ambitions of this new school .

		There will be no ordinary `` examinations , '' no system of accountancy which enables the indifferent student to accumulate academic credit bit by bit .

		The only credit possible will be the willingness of the instructors to ex - press approval of the student 's ability , achievements , and promise .

		And of the teachers : It is hoped that no `` inferiority complex '' will be formed among the younger members , who in many institutions feel themselves hopelessly subordinated to men who have passed the state of active readjustment .

		There will be no academic ranks or hierarchy , except the distinctions , in no way invidious , between the regular staff , upon whom the conduct of the school will devolve , the temporary assistants or apprentices , and the lecturers from the out - side who will be appointed for a term only .

		There is a third departure , implicit though not formally expressed in the present announcement .

		It is obviously the intention of the founders to emanci - pate the new School for Research from any depend - ence upon capitalistic interests which have been as - sumed to influence social and economic teaching in American colleges .

		In this respect it may be re - garded as a movement in the direction of dissent , non-conformity ,
Congregationalism	ORGANIZATION	, similar to that which marks the decline of established churches and is a prelude to their disestablishment .

		By the dis - establishment of a church Irish ,
Welsh	ORGANIZATION	, Anglican , or Gallican is understood not only the exclusion of its clergy from official sanction , but , more important , the separation of the institution from endowments , official revenue , and patronage .

		The disestablish - ment of university education in the
United States	LOCATION	may scarcely be prophesied from the appearance of the new school as a sort of free kirk outside the jurisdiction of the synod .

		Nevertheless it is a sign of the times which may become a portent .

		The school opens
February	DATE	first at 465 West Twenty-third Street .

		The presence among the teachers of Professors
Veblen	PERSON	,
Beard	ORGANIZATION	,
J. H. Robin	PERSON	- son ,
W. C. Mitchell	PERSON	, and others will indicate to readers of THE DIAL the character and value of the instruction offered .

		THE DIAL greets the New School with cordial good wishes .

		1 HE CAMPAIGN OF THE AMERICAN COMMITTEE for Armenian and Syrian relief , which will last the week of
January 12	DATE	to 19 , should enlist the sympathy of everyone .

		Millions of Armenians , Greeks ,
Syri	PERSON	- ans , and Persians were deprived of all their posses - sions and of the very means of life in
1915	DATE	, when they were deported and massacred by the Turks .

		Nearly four millions of these people have survived , struggling into precarious safety in
Syria	LOCATION	,
Mesopo	PERSON	- tamia , and the Russian Caucasus .

		Here for months past they have been utterly dependent on the charity of strangers .

		To all their miseries the final over - whelming sorrow of family separation has often been added indeed the marvel is that any remnant has survived , that any refugees , after years of wan - dering and torment , staggered , starving and half - naked , into any sphere of help .

		These pathetic beings , alien in race , religion , and sympathies to the government under which they have lived for cen - turies , make an especially immediate appeal .

		For the chaos of the
Near East	LOCATION	has for so long been everybody 's business that it runs the risk of soon becoming nobody 's business .

		It sfiould be a point of honor with
America	LOCATION	that we will not allow these people to perish .

		And fortunately the
American Committee	ORGANIZATION	does not contemplate mere charity .

		To feed the hungry and clothe the naked is only the beginning .

		The commission intends to examine causes and so far as possible devise preventive work for the future .

		The American expedition will in - clude trained nurses , doctors , expert mechanics , sanitary engineers , agriculturists , orphanage super - intendents , and teachers .

		Yet important as this work is , it must be financed entirely by voluntary subscription .

		We are offered a practical oppor - tunity to show what esprit de corps among nations means .

		For whatever the foundation of the future
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	, it must rest for its last security upon the spiritual sanction of fellowship and human pity for unmerited suffering .

		SINCE its last issue THE DIAL has received many communications in confirmation of its demand for the release of political prisoners , including conscien - tious objectors .

		It is possible to publish only one of these the admirably reasoned statement of the problems of conscience and martyrdom in war which appears on page 93 .

		The facts in regard to the treatment of conscientious objectors are now appear - ing in the press , notably in the
New York World	LOCATION	.

		They bear out the conclusion that American soldiers can be guilty of atrocities no less mad than those attributed to their enemies and further establish the impotence of a well-intentioned Secretary of War to deal with his subordinates committing them .

		His original order discharging three officers was withdrawn because they were in the regular army and could not be dismissed without trial and no charges have been brought .

		The release of con - scientious objectors now in confinement , the pun - ishment of men who tortured them , are responsibili - ties of the American people .

		They are a challenge to its chivalry a test of its morale .

		92 THE DIAL
January 25	DATE	Foreign Comment BARBUSSE 'S VIEW OF PRESIDENT
WILSON	PERSON	From the day that President
Wilson	PERSON	landed in
France	LOCATION	we have been learning of the French Social - ists ' attempts to `` capture ''
Wilson	PERSON	.

		This may have been somewhat confusing to those not acquainted with the partisan bitterness of French politics , for the truth of the matter is that all the radical parties in
Europe	LOCATION	are hoping to use
Wilson	PERSON	as a club over the more reactionary members of their own govern - ments .

		In
Italy	LOCATION	, especially , the overtures of the
Socialist Party	ORGANIZATION	to President
Wilson	PERSON	over the head of the regular Government had a dramatic directness and appeal .

		The following article written by
Henri Barbusse	PERSON	, author of Under Fire , in the
December 15 , 1918	DATE	issue of Le Populaire , the
Paris	LOCATION	Socialist paper , reveals what high hopes the radical parties of
France	LOCATION	place in President
Wilson	PERSON	.

		The transla - tion is by
Andre Tridon	PERSON	.

		The article in Le Popu - laire was called
Wilson	PERSON	, Citizen of the World , and follows :
Wilson	PERSON	is one of the loftiest figures in this war and in our times , if not the loftiest .

		Above ambition , compro - mise , and world-wide intrigue , he has stated principles which are to regulate the common life of human societies , in words which are admirably clear and accurate .

		The body of his messages constitutes the noblest and most complete presentation any statesman ever made of the essential postulates of internationalism .

		He has not been the first to formulate a doctrine of international politics which in its main points and in its general spirit is that of the socialist party , but at least he has seen far ahead , he has seen the ultimate goal .

		He has understood that advance in one direction is inseparable from advance in other directions , that truth begets truth and that all truths become one , and that the important thing is to create something consistent , to be really Constructive .

		f The very importance of his presidential post enhances his glory , not only because it has given more weight to his words , but because it raised obstacles which he had to surmount .

		He is a great ethical teacher , a great human type .

		He is a forerunner of the integral democracy .

		Thanks to him and regardless of what tomorrow may bring , the first step taken by democracy was a giant stride .

		Compared to him the men who govern
Europe	LOCATION	cut small figures , and as far as we French are concerned , we shall have no cause to pride ourselves , some day , on the small stir created , after
Wilson	PERSON	's creative words , by the harangues of those academicians who preside over our republic and our cabinet , and who have only been moved by the thought of a peaceful organization of the world the ones , to silence ; the others , to irony .

		It is not difficult for anyone to say that he desires justice and universal peace .

		That was the constant pretension of Napoleon I and of
William II	PERSON	.

		Nor it is difficult for anyone to say that he agrees with
Wilson	PERSON	.

		Many have been proclaiming that they do .

		It would be better , however , to realize what such a profession of faith binds one to .

		It would be better to understand that whosoever wants the end must want the means .

		It would be better to want both the means and the end .

		If at this time , when the future of the world is being built up under conditions which are not such as to re - assure the righteous-minded , we did not feel so deeply perturbed , we would smile at all those projected
Leagues of Nations	ORGANIZATION	shrinking to the dimensions of exclusive or official clubs , at all those grand appeals to a hate-ridden fraternity , at all those machinations that would bring about an internationalism devoid of any international spirit .

		But we would usurp the prerogatives of those who shall judge us some day , if we should assign his proper place to the man whose public promises are not a mere veil cast over secret dealings ; to the man who , in our troublous times , has been not only the mightiest among men , but the most clear-sighted and the most sincere ; to the man who has been able to define masterfully the complex world problem by planting the accurate stakes of his formulas democracy versus autocracy , self-deter - mination of nations , open diplomacy , no annexations and no indemnities , no economic barriers ; to the chief of state who has not jeered at the democratic strivings of
Russia	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	; to the splendid logician who dared to say that general interest must be placed above national in - terest , a noble saying which casts upon world ethics a radiance comparable to that which , emanating from the precepts of the early Christians , revolutionized the souls of men .

		It is the duty of the
Socialist Party	ORGANIZATION	to greet respectfully and to acclaim gratefully the President of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		It may come to pass -LRB- for the very purity of his thought does not allow us to retain many illusions -RRB- that
Wilson	PERSON	the Exceptional will become some day
Wilson	PERSON	the Lonely ; that the ambitions of other dominating forces may succeed in discarding or in disfiguring by burlesquing it , a doctrine whose complete , or simply honest , application would officially deal a death blow to imperialism ; and that little by little all beauty shall be taken away from the Wilsonian Commandments .

		We shall wage a stubborn fight that such a thing may never be .

		Regardless of whatever may happen , however , the great party of the poor , of the workers , of mankind , will never cease to give his deserts to the ruler who has proved the most sensational broadener of ideas and destroyer of abuses .

		The socialist ideal must not become identified with any man , whatever his genius or his sense of justice may be .

		That ideal has become too lucid , too conscious , too concrete .

		The Peoples ' International will sooner or later put an end to the deepest and most interminable of human tragedies , and that organization shall be reared by the masses themselves , over the age-worn remains of a cankered society .

		But it shall be elementary justice on the part of the new society to recognize the enormous advance achieved by the ideas of social liberation , thanks to ^ the school-teacher who became the ruler of the world 's mightiest nation .

		It shall be said then that , alone among the mighty , in these days of deluge , he found himself in accord with eternal truth , and that , after all , no human being has done more than he has to eliminate an order of things which for the past six thousand years has been breeding war , and to eliminate war which for the patt six thousand years has upheld this order of things .

		HENRI BARBUSSE .

		QUESTIONS In the
Toronto	LOCATION	Statesman of
January 11 , 1919	DATE	appears a list of questions which the
British Labor Party	ORGANIZATION	, in the recent election in
England	LOCATION	, asked of
Lloyd George	PERSON	.

		Needless to say , the British Gov - ernment did not answer them .

		Neither were they answered in the campaign speeches of the Coalition candidates .

		The text is substantially as follows : 1 .

		Are there now 50,000 soldiers of the Allies at Archangel fighting
Bolshevik Russia	LOCATION	?

		Is their com - mander now in
London	LOCATION	asking for reinforcements ?

		Will the safety of these men be endangered unless they are recalled before the winter ice makes their return impos -
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 93 sible ?

		Is the
Government	ORGANIZATION	influenced in this matter by the fact that the
French Government	ORGANIZATION	accepted Russian cou - pons as payment for war loans ?

		2 .

		Does the
Government	ORGANIZATION	believe that the documents proving the Bolsheviki to have been in league with the German militarists are genuine ?

		Does the Censor pass them for publication in the press ?

		Were they refused here as forgeries before a more credulous institution in
Washington	LOCATION	accepted them ?

		3 .

		Is the
British Government	ORGANIZATION	taking any steps for the restoration of the Czardom in
Russia	LOCATION	?

		Is it true that the new currency for
Northern Russia	LOCATION	was sent from this country and was found on arrival to bear the imperial eagle ?

		Was this just folly or intelligent anticipation ?

		.

		PEACE OR WAR ?

		On
February 24 , 1918	DATE	,
Nicolai Lenin	PERSON	made the following statement -LRB- given only in its essential part -RRB- in justification of his contention that the harsh terms of Brest-Litovsk , imposed upon helpless
Russia	LOCATION	by the Germans , should be ratified .

		The statement was part of his fight against revolutionary ideology which issued in no definite action .

		It presents a striking contrast to the fiery invective of Trotsky : The reply of the Germans , as the leaders see , gives us terms of peace even more difficult than those of
Brest	LOCATION	- Litovsk .

		And yet I am absolutely convinced that only complete intoxication with the revolutionary phrase can persuade anyone to refuse to sign these terms .

		This is why I began in articles in the Pravda signed `` Karpov '' a merciless struggle against the `` revolutionary phrase '' and against the `` revolutionary itch '' because 1 saw in it the greatest danger to our party and therefore to the revo - lution .

		Revolutionary parties that strictly carry out revolutionary slogans have been ill with `` revolutionary phrase '' many times in history , and perished on account of it ... In thesis 17 I wrote that if we should refuse to sign the proposed peace , then `` hardest defeats will compel
Russia	LOCATION	to make an even more unprofitable peace . ''

		It proved to be even worse because our retreating and demobilizing army refused altogether to fight .

		At the present moment only impetuous phrases could force Rus - sia , in its immediate hopeless condition , back into the war ; and I personally will of course not remain for a second in a government or on the central committee of our party , if the policy of phrase is to take the upper hand .

		Today the bitter truth has shown itself so horribly clear that it is impossible not to see it .

		The entire bour - geoisie of
Russia	LOCATION	is rejoicing and celebrating the arrival of the Germans .

		Only those who are intoxicated with mere phrases can shut their eyes to the fact that the policy of a revolutionary war w ithout an army is water to the mill of the bourgeoisie .

		In Dwinsk Russian offi - cers are already wearing their shoulder straps .

		In Riezhitza the bourgeoisie greeted the Germans with great joy .

		In
Petrograd	LOCATION	, on the
Nevsky	LOCATION	, in the bourgeois news - papers the Rietch , the
Dielo Naroda	PERSON	, the
Novy Lutch	PERSON	, and others everyone is preparing to celebrate the an - ticipated overthrow of Soviet power by the Germans .

		Everybody must by this time see that those against this immediate , against this supremely difficult peace , are ruining Soviet power .

		We are compelled to go through a most difficult peace .

		This peace will not stop the revolution in
Germany	LOCATION	and in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		We will organize a
Revolutionary Army	ORGANIZATION	not by phrases and exclamations as it vaas being organized by those who , from the
7th of January	DATE	on did not do anything to prevent our armies from running away but by organization , by action cre - ating a serious , national , mighty army .

		Communications THE BLOOD OF THE MARTYRS SIR : The letter of
John Nevin Sayre	PERSON	, which was published in THE DIAL of
December 28	DATE	, prompts me to write to you in regard to the treat - ment of political prisoners in
America	LOCATION	a matter which touches the conscience of each one of us .

		For several months I have followed with increas - ing interest and amazement the discussion and communications published in some of our journals concerning the small group of conscientious objectors to physical combat , who are now caught between the upper and nether millstones of popular supersti - tion and inertia .

		I have finally come to believe that the circumstances concerning these men constitute so intricate and curious a problem that their rescue can only be effected by finding whose peculiar wards they are , and which of our institutions should claim the right of interpreting their situation in a manner to secure their exemption from further punishment .

		The liberal press has put the burden of this responsi - bility quite squarely upon its readers and it is now necessary that a still further specialization of re - sponsibility be accepted .

		In the first analysis the release of these prisoners will be a thoroughly practical issue and will have to be undertaken on definite grounds by persons to whose special keeping has been entrusted the order of interests peculiarly menaced by the incarceration and legalized illtreatment of these men .

		Instinctively some of us turn to the Church , feel - ing that the Church does truly claim the right to protect the man or woman who clearly follows the dictates of that which we have grown accustomed to call conscience .

		All of us know that the human lineage of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	militant is a lineage of saints and martyrs , and that in all ages these have con - stituted a small residue of beings differing from the mass of persons with whom they have been con - temporaries , and who , because of some phase of other-mindedness concerning right and wrong nor in consonance with the common-mindedness , have opposed the common will rather than betray the truth as it appeared to them .

		Such beings in all times have brought upon themselves monstrous suf - ferings .

		The crowd which has condemned them for sin has also condemned them for ' folly , since they have chosen sorrow and bitter hardship rather than speak the word or give the sign of yielding which would place them once again in harmony with their fellows and bring relief from their sufferings .

		Personally , I shall always believe that the Church is the rightful apologist for all those who suffer for conscience ' sake ; but I also believe that her his - torical affiliation with the
State	ORGANIZATION	, especially in times of war , makes her sincerely doubt the genuineness 94 THE DIAL
January 25	DATE	of any call which inclines an individual to place himself at variance with the national decree in war time .

		So that , although the Church honors above all other possessions those martyrs who in past cen - turies have shed the bitter tears and blood of physical anguish rather than submit to decrees which were repugnant to their conscience , she appears to find herself unable to defend the same quality of conduct when such conduct is in disaccord with the generally recognized interests of the
State	ORGANIZATION	in times of war .

		Such a thought causes infinite distress and raises within one the question as to how far the temporal kingdom has made ground over the kingdom where `` we wrestle not against flesh and blood , but against principalities , against powers , against the rulers of the darkness of this world , against spiritual wicked - ness in high places . ''

		If we admit that these men are sincere in their convictions , then we must look upon them whether or no as martyrs , since they suffer for conscience ' sake .

		On the other hand , if we consider martydom an inconvenience and anachronism in these later days , our celebration of such virtues as practised in the past becomes simply a fashion of homage and tribute to a legendary and mythical period , of great beauty and dignity .

		No other way seems open to us unless we are prepared to admit that God himself has so unmistakably sanctioned warfare between nations that the man who obeys a contrary indication is misled by the voice of the Evil One and therefore , from the medieval point of view , can only be turned from his evil way by torture .

		The difficulty may lie far deeper than many of us realize and may be inherent in the origin of the Church itself , which , rooted and grounded as it is in the Mosaic tradition , may carry with it an uncon - scious sanction of war and therefore an instinctive execration of those who fail to defend the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		If we admit such a conclusion we must indeed seek elsewhere for the protection of these beings , though with a heavy heart and much sorrow , since we believe these - men to be innocent and believe also that the living Church is our greatest medium for the expression of lasting good .

		Turning to the body of men to whom justice as embodied in law is especially committed , one also finds great difficulties , for this body is in a practical sense dedicated , it seems to me , rather to the defense of that which is legal than to the reinterpretation of man 's relationship to his fellow man in a living , changing race .

		In its estimation , what law has here - tofore sanctioned by use and confirmed by honorable precedent is lawful ; so that the past , with its earlier beliefs and practices , conditions most heavily the acceptance of a later concept .

		How , therefore , can we ask its protection for men who have in a sense become a law unto themselves and are in conflict with the common will as embodied in the laws ?

		Nevertheless , many and bitter are one 's reflections at this point when one considers the countless and flagrant instances known to us all wherein the most respectable and honored citizens continually evade enacted law concerning such questions as payment of taxes , customs duties , and many other matters where sophistical cunning and manipulation of the letter enable the `` wise '' to defeat entirely the spirit of the law .

		Such offenders have no sense whatever of sin or even of wrongdoing ; and yet among groups of such wilful evaders of the law one finds ` the strong - est condemnation of the conscientious objector to physical combat , as one who defrauds the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		Would it not be safer in the long run to turn this group over to the pathologist , and to acknowledge at once that the age is rightly committed to the cult of pseudo-pragmatic values , and that such persons as are willing to endure suffering and anguish rather than relinquish their ideals are defective , in the sense of being ignorant of how to obtain what they want at the expense of others rather than at their own expense ?

		From this point of view , cer - tainly , these persons have been lacking in common sense to entail upon themselves consequences so out of proportion to their fault , when , by a little ma - neuvering , they could have had an easy time with not too much loss of dignity or without violating too obviously their own ideals .

		If there is any justi - fication whatever for a man 's willingness to endure great sorrows rather than yield to the temptation of betraying by one jot his conception of right , then these men deserve to find protection at the hand of such institutions as proclaim the reality and claim of a spiritual life ; but if , on the other hand , no such claim can be defended in any vital sense , then these men should be protected from further persecution on the ground that they are defective in ordinary intelligence and victims of a kind of pathologic obstinacy and hallucination .

		Whichever way we put it , it seems to me that they are entitled to rescue and to amends from society itself , which through its , heedlessness and lack of inquiry into affairs for which it is entirely responsible allows injustices of this nature to go unrebuked and unchallenged nay more , to be actually committed in its name .

		The anguish of these abandoned ones cries out upon our comfort and upon our easily held creeds .

		Even though we do not succeed in righting their grievous wrong so that they gain relief through such action , I have an inner feeling that they will be the last of
America	LOCATION	's sons sacrificed to a medieval con - ception of disciplinary punishment , and that in spite of the material conceptions of our age vicarious sacrifice will again have justified itself and that the suffering of this little company will not have been in vain .

		By
J. Henri Fabre	PERSON	.

		Dodd ,
Mead	LOCATION	;
$ 1.60	MONEY	.

		The cult of Fabre appears to be enjoying a rather longer lease of life than customarily falls to any fashion , whether of clothes , the dance , or literature , so that a superficial observer would stoutly deny that it was merely a cult .

		But the simple fact remains inexorable : the extraordinary , humanistic genius of
Fabre	PERSON	, coupled with the talent of his translators and the faith of his publishers , has succeeded in making it rather clever and stylish to know some - thing about the humble insects to whose lives the great French naturalist devoted his own .

		The Souvenirs Entomologiques are , in their way , as unique and permanent as
Brehm	PERSON	's animal studies in theirs , or
White	ORGANIZATION	's

Fabre	PERSON	will endure as a master of his particular field .

		The Sacred Beetle and Others is the eighth of the
Fabre	PERSON	translations .

		Alexander Teixeira de Mattos gives us every nuance and charm of the original ; and the various life-cycles narrated with such quaint anthropomorphism and side-glances , at philosophy make us regret , very keenly , that the stern requirements of animal and comparative psychology forbid them the name of `` Science .

		YOUNG ADVENTURE .

		By
Stephen Vincent Benet	PERSON	.


Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		A tonic humor is one of the chief gifts of this charming young poet .

		Whether he paints a Portrait of a Baby , writes a stinging Elegy for an Enemy , or makes acute analysis of The Breaking Point , he evinces an intellectual vigor which rarely accom - panies so profound a passion for beauty .

		That he has the latter is clear , in the very opening of the book , in that curiously uneven and intriguing poem , The Drug-Shop , or , Endymion in Edmonstoun : Night falls ; the great jars glow against the dark , Dark green , dusk red , and , like a coiling snake , Writhing eternally in smoky gyres .

		Great ropes of gorgeous vapor twist and turn Within them .

		So the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	fishermen Saw the swart genie rise ... The same evocative magic is in his ballad The Hemp , one of the most dramatic poems in the book .

		Take for example the manner in which he induces so different a mood as this : The sky was blue , and the sea was still , The waves lapped softly , hill on hill , And between one wave and another wave The doomed man 's cries were little and shrill .

		Drama is of the essence of his verse .

		In one poem at least
Benet	PERSON	is not so much at
Browning	PERSON	's feet as in
Browning	ORGANIZATION	's chair .

		One can imagine old Robert looking with a fond eye at this young man who so perfectly comprehends the fascination of gorgeous Roman settings and murders of finesse .

		Throughout , however ,
Benet	PERSON	has a lyricism rather reminiscent of
Noyes	ORGANIZATION	.

		Indeed his poem on
Keats	PERSON	suffers by these foreign echoes .

		But what is good in his poetry is naturally what is his own .

		And his own is versatility .

		Perhaps it is , rather , poetic understanding , for what
Benet	PERSON	does is to paint against a sympathetic background people caught in an emotion .

		But because he is a man and is young , it is courage that most engages him not the fearlessness of brute strength , but the indomitable Galahad in men .

		These poems make one paraphrase the familiar line to read : `` The quality of courage is not strained . ''

		Mr.
Benet	PERSON	writes of battle and writes well .

		It is not to de - preciate the worth of his achievement to say that this is a book of promise .

		FOUR YEARS IN THE WHITE NORTH .

		By
Donald B. MacMillan	PERSON	.

		Harper ;
$ 4	MONEY	.

		If you have ever stepped from an overheated com - mittee-room into the clear , frosty air of a
November	DATE
night	TIME	, then you have a physical parallel for the sort of mental lung-filling with which one turns the pages of this book after too much perusing of war volumes .

		Sledging over uncharted wastes at the top of the world far from Soviets and censorships may not be the best way to keep in touch with war , but it is an admirable way to keep in touch with some things which war-logged folk are in danger of losing .

		Even the illustrations of this book are a relief , after endless
Sunday	DATE	supplements with their rotogravure revelations of devastation .

		The author has set down the varied adventures of the
Crocker Land Expedition	ORGANIZATION	during four years of exploration in
North Greenland	LOCATION	, an undertaking which , though it disproved the existence of Crocker Land as placed upon our latest maps , resulted in many discoveries of positive value .

		Mr.
MacMillan	PERSON	writes with the enthusiasm of a pathfinder rather than the cold pre - cision of a scientist , filling the narrative with bits of experience in which the human and humorous elements have been retained .

		There is , for example , this appreciative passage with its tribute to crafts - manship and orderliness .

		Somehow , we always had the idea that igloos were messy , murky holes : It is a pleasure to see an Eskimo cut and handle snow .

		One can not but admire the skill and dexterity with which he cuts it on the surface , breaks it out with his toe , lays it up on the wall , bevels the edges , and thumps it into place with his hand .

		I wonder if there are any other people in the world who attempt to build an arch or dome without support .

		Starting from the ground in a spiral from right to left , the blocks mount higher and higher , ever assuming a more horizontal position , until the last two or three appear to hang in the air , the last block locking the whole structure .

		Entering a newly constructed igloo seems like a vision of fairy-land , the light filtering through the snow a beau - tiful ethereal blue ; everything the bed , the two side plat - forms , the wall absolutely spotless .

		In the course of the narrative the author contrives to drop sufficient historical background of Arctic travel to put this expedition in its true perspective .

		THE FLAMING < CRUCIBLE .

		By
Andre Fri	PERSON	- bourg .

		Macmillan ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Although , from the first page to the last , this book bears evidence of authentic personal reaction , it is the closing chapters dealing with the returned soldier 's halting readjustment to his pre-war sur - roundings that are most significant .

		Perhaps it is because we are so sated with the fighting reac - tions -LRB- since more writers have chosen to deal with them -RRB- that these closing pages of
The Flaming Crucible	ORGANIZATION	seem to carry a fresher note .

		Both in poignant literary expression and in illuminating flashes of psychology , this groping of a war-racked consciousness among the strange yet familiar paths of security gives the book distinctive merit .

		Fribourg writes in the febrile , sometimes almost brittle , style of a man whose calmer faculties have been swept aside in an abrupt clash with the primi - tive elements of his nature .

		And with this surrender comes acceptance of the fatalism of the soldier : Why should I go more quickly ?

		If I hasten I shall be hit by the bullet that would have passed before me ; if I delay , by the bullet that would have passed behind .

		In any event I shall exhaust myself the sooner ... Learn to wait .

		Whatever you do your blood is going to course more swiftly in
this night	TIME	's journey , and the passing min - utes , any one of which may be your last , are infinitely precious .

		Every bullet that grazes you will reveal some - thing and show the way ; for , when the mortal stroke comes , illusions fly away .

		Death , face to face , is clearly seen .

		Here the facts of hardship and privation are not glossed , but baldly painted i/i quick strokes .

		Here are the mud and misery and madness , made real in unadorned sentences .

		In between , however , there are passages of eloquence which seem to be set off not without the suspicion of a time-fuse .

		The inter - est ebbs at these soarings by appointment .

		The translation , by
Arthur B. Maurice	PERSON	, testifies to a sympathetic absorption in the original .

		THE FOUNDATIONS AND NATURE OF VERSE .

		By
Gary F. Jacob	PERSON	.


Columbia University Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		It is only natural that the rapid development of freer forms of verse should be attended by a re - crudescence of interest in problems of prosody .

		The old problem of the essential basis or bases of English verse is now being threshed out all over again .

		The relation in point of rhythm between prose and verse has become a curiously live question .

		Some see in prose and verse two naturally distinct and unbridge - able forms of expression ; others consider them as merely the poles of a continuous gamut of possible forms , some of which are only now being consciously explored as artistic media .

		In his conscientious if somewhat dull book Dr.
Jacob	PERSON	takes us over a great deal of familiar ground , leads us , with shrewd deliberation , into many a blind alley of negation , leaves himself apparently little or no ground to stand on , and triumphantly concludes with a statement of principles and natural limitations .

		Too much space is devoted to prelim - inaries acoustic , ethnographic , psychologic .

		It is difficult to see , for instance , what meat the humble prosodist is expected to extract from the lengthy chapter on pitch , with its array of citations from technical treatises on acoustics and from antiquated works of an ethnographic nature .

		On the whole one gathers that Dr.
Jacob	PERSON	's psychologic and purely musical equipment is superior to either his culture - historical or his linguistic equipment .

		This may well be erring on the right side , but it also tends to limit his perspective in a way that is not always fortunate .

		Phonetic phenomena are as good as ignored .

		Again , the problems of English verse structure are not set against a historical or compara - ^ tive background that would serve to bring out in proper relief its own essential peculiarities .

		The book offers nothing really new .

		To the dev - otees of freer prosodic forms it will prove a dis - appointment .

		No natural basis , however broad , is pointed out that would justify free verse as a realm of artistic promise .

		Between the accidental rhythms of prose and the more or less rigidly recurrent metric units of normal verse Dr.
Jacobs	PERSON	throws no bridge .

		The book strikes one , despite its liberal employment of psychologic and prosodic authorities , as needlessly narrow in outlook .

		Like many prosodists , Dr.
Jacob	PERSON	attaches probably too great importance to the purely objective and experimental study of rhythmic

		SOME HAPPENINGS .

		By
Horace Annesley Vachell	PERSON	.

		Doran ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		The Englishman , though he travels extensively and frequently writes about his travels , is not usually credited with taking on much color from the scenes and people he visits .

		This can not be said of
Horace Annesley Vachell	PERSON	, who in his collection of short stories , Some Happenings , tells tales of Western life with true appreciation of its quality , tales of peasant life in
France	LOCATION	with sympathetic understanding of the Breton character , and tales of the West and East Ends of
London	LOCATION	with insight and humor .

		Through - out these stories the human values are emphasized and the writer brings to light the essential kindli - ness which is said to be inherent in every man , how - ever rough or arid or vulgar he may appear to be .

		Especially noteworthy for its Cockney wit is Bean - feasters , and for its poignant appeal the tragic story of
The Death Mask	ORGANIZATION	.

		Those who like love and laughter love that is not too urgent , and laughter that is not too loud who enjoy humorous character - ization and varied settings , will find this book to their taste , but those who require the complexity that exists in actual life may find the texture of these tales somewhat flimsy .

		OUT OF THE SILENCES .

		By
Mary E. Waller	PERSON	.

		Little ,
Brown	PERSON	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Miss
Waller	PERSON	has neglected that quite necessary duty of the novelist to fix the tempo of her story , and then to remain faithful to it .

		Her failure to do this results in a compositional defect which thwarts the reader at every turn .

		She improvises upon her material , running her hands up and down the emotional keys for a series of loosely articulated effects , some of which carry and some of which fail .

		This absence of tempo a tempo in harmony with the mood of the story is evident in the lagging and disproportionately detailed beginning , which throws the ensuing chapters out of focus , and in the author 's inability to rivet attention upon her central figure of the `` man-boy , indomitable of will , inbued with the symbolism and nature worship of the Indians , eager for the new , the strange . ''

		In order to bring the threads of the improvisation into the semblance of harmony , there is a final chord echoing the thunders of war , but even this device contributes little sweep to the story .

		Miss
Waller	PERSON	here displays little of that warmth of insight which gave a certain quality to The Woodcarver of ` Lympus .

		One has difficulty in accepting the reality of a man brought up in the wilds of western Can - ada , schooled in stoic repressions and hardship , only to slip simultaneously into love and rhapsody thus : `` What more can a man ask for in this world ?

		This one hour here with you .

		And then my luck think of it !

		to be one infinitesimal human atom sandwiched in be - tween the upheaved , broken-in-pieces , red-lava-overflowed strata of two ages in humanity 's history ; and , just at the right moment , to be given a fighting chance to strike one blow for the survival of what should be most fit for this world . ''

Miss Waller	PERSON	's pen , out of the silences comes hyperbole .

		IAL A FORTNIGHTLY The Paper War .

		T ONE END of the
Piazza di Spagna	ORGANIZATION	in
Rome	LOCATION	rises an old building bearing the legend '' Collegia di Propaganda Fide . ''

		Here , in the middle of the seventeenth century , was founded by
Pope Urban VIII	ORGANIZATION	the first school of propagandists to spread the true faith among Teutonic peoples .

		I do not know that the Imperial German Government in its wide-reaching plot for world conquest consciously revived this ancient Roman institution .

		But it is certain that to the German example the world is indebted for the curse of propaganda , which in the
last four years	DATE	has spread like a pestilence through - out every corner of the world ; and today shows no sign of abatement .

		Ample revelations have be - trayed to what extent German propaganda was engi - neered chiefly in the two Americas , also the prodigal sums of money spent by the
German Government	ORGANIZATION	in this and the allied activities of arson and violence , which may be considered as the '' direct action '' arm of propaganda .

		Opinions will differ as to the effi - ciency of German propaganda .

		It is probable that , on the whole , the efforts of these German agents indirectly assisted the
United States	LOCATION	into the world war .

		At any rate , if it takes several tons of metal to kill a soldier in modern battle , it takes as many tons of presswork and picture reels , as well as mil - lions of money spent on special missions to gather in a few converts , who , judging by the German results , do not stay converted .

		German propaganda has been a colossal failure and a costly one .

		During the first months of the war the Entente Governments were too busy about other matters to organize their propaganda and counter-propaganda .

		Their cause , it seemed , was good enough of itself broken treaties , invaded
Belgium	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	to dispense with special pleading .

		Sometimes , when one contemplates their later activities in the ramifi - cation of propaganda , one wishes that the Allied Governments had continued to let the great Cause speak for itself without the efforts of an army of proselytizers .

		For it is debatable whether allied propaganda has materially hastened the victory , but it is hardly debatable that it has been attended with evil consequences which may far out - run the scope of the present conflict .

		Early in
1915	DATE	it was apparent that the activities of German propa - gandists were worrying the Allied authorities .

		The English felt that , especially in the
United States	LOCATION	, they suffered from the lack of an organized press propaganda , though most of the better known and more responsible newspapers were distinctly friendly to the cause of the Allies .

		The French had already begun the organization of a propaganda bureau as an adjunct to
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs	ORGANIZATION	.

		To the small rooms in the rear of the Quai d'Orsay building , where the
Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	is now sitting , visiting journalists were led by the back stairs to obtain those privileges of information and military observation which , at that time , the French rather timidly and grudgingly granted .

		By .

		1916 the simple installation in the rear of the
Quai d'Orsay Ministry	ORGANIZATION	had evolved into the famous
Maison de la Presse	ORGANIZATION	, which occupied , with its many bureaus , a large six story building on the
Rue Frangois Premier	ORGANIZATION	.

		This was one of the busiest hives of wartime
Paris	LOCATION	; there the promising novelist , the art critic , the publicist , or the well-recommended belle chanteuse , as well as the more vulgar film operator and press agent , found directions and mate - rial support for patriotic activities in the propa - gande .

		From the Maison de la Presse were de - spatched to every neutral and Entente nation select '' missions . ''

		The chief focus of all this Allied propaganda was the
United States	LOCATION	, especially Wash - ington and
New York	LOCATION	, though itinerant propagand - ists in great variety have covered every section of the country .

		By this time the English propaganda , also , was in full blast , under the blunt leadership of Lord Northcliffe , with a Minister at home in the person of Lord
Beaverbrook	PERSON	all to itself .

		In those days Fifth Avenue became a multi-colored parade of Allied propaganda .

		One could scarcely dine with - out meeting a fair propagandist or distinguished Frenchman or titled Englishman -LRB- titles in war be - ing chiefly for American consumption ! -RRB-

		, or enter a theater without suffering some secret or overt stimulation from the propaganda .

		When we entered the war the game grew more furious , for to the Babel of the existing propaganda was now added not only the voices of Jugo-Slavia ,
Czecho	PERSON	-
Slovakia	LOCATION	, and other small nationalities strug - gling to be born , but our own .

		For it was decreed that , just as we must have a real general staff , our own heavy artillery , and manufacture our own poison gas , so we must have our own
Bureau of Public Information	ORGANIZATION	, with an export division for 114 THE DIAL
February 8	DATE	conveying our special
U. S.	PERSON	brand of propaganda into friendly and neutral countries .

		This com - pleted the full bedlam of Allied propaganda , with the ironic situation of a proud democracy taxing itself to pay the interpreters and corrupters of its national thought .

		For eighteen months the
United States	LOCATION	has suffered mentally and morally from the nuisance of conflicting propaganda -LRB- Jugo-Slav versus Italian , French and English versus
Russia	LOCATION	, and so on -RRB- besides the output of its own official opinion-makers .

		As a crowning touch for the comedy , the President set sail for the
Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	accompanied by his Minister of Propaganda and a chosen staff of press agents .

		For what purpose ?

		To persuade
Europe	LOCATION	of the purity of our national motives ?

		Or to persuade our own citizens that their chief executive was really doing things in
Europe	LOCATION	?

		Much of all this shooting of paper bullets has had merely negative results .


Russia	LOCATION	is an excellent example of how much can be spent on propaganda with no result .

		Not to dwell on the fruitless efforts of the official
United States	LOCATION	propagandists to get their wares into
Russia	LOCATION	and what effect could there be in telling the Russians how benevolently we felt towards them while we were sending troops to
Vladivostok	LOCATION	and Archangel ?

		the general Entente propaganda on
Russia	LOCATION	has been especially bewildered .

		The object of this campaign in the
United States	LOCATION	was to create a state of public opinion that would compel immediate armed intervention on a large scale in
Russia	LOCATION	, which was desired especially by
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	.

		To that end our newspapers were regularly fed with reports from .

		Stockholm ,
Paris	LOCATION	, and
London	LOCATION	, of Soviet atrocities .

		The same stories were frequently repeated as fresh news after short intervals .

		Finally came the ludicrous yarn of a
St. Bartholomew	LOCATION	massacre in
Moscow	LOCATION	- which proved to be pure hoax .

		The German end was worked by inducing our official
Bureau of Public Information	ORGANIZATION	to father the discredited
Sisson	PERSON	docu - ments in order that the unwary citizen might be led to believe that armed intervention in
Russia	LOCATION	meant fighting
Germany	LOCATION	's allies , and hence Ger - many .

		Meanwhile alternate currents of fear '' and hope were sent over the propaganda wires by two generaal reports : one that the rule of the Russian Soviets would collapse `` in a few weeks '' ; the other , that the `` Red Army '' was making dangerous progress .

		-LRB- I have seen the two reports side by side in the columns of a
New York	LOCATION	newspaper , where evidently the propaganda time schedule had become confused ! -RRB-

		The net results of the whole immense , wasteful , and misleading propaganda on
Russia	LOCATION	would seem , at the present moment , to be zero .

		Now that peace is remotely in sight , our friends of the
Associated Governments	ORGANIZATION	should see the pro- priety of removing at once their tutorial forces from the
United States	LOCATION	.

		If
London	LOCATION	and
Paris	LOCATION	would but release their stranglehold on the cables and permit uncensored news to circulate freely , there is enough intelligence still left in this democracy , even after suffering the passions of war , to enable us to reach our own conclusions on world problems .

		Other means of employing the intellectual classes and of giving deserved vacations in comfortable
America	LOCATION	to war-worn heroes can be found .

		Most of us would welcome our guests more warmly if they did not arrive , each with a brief in his pocket and a fixed resolve to do our thinking for us .

		These are but the ephemeral annoyances of the war , however .

		They will pass with the over-production of
TNT	ORGANIZATION	and mustard gas .

		The real menace of propaganda is the discovery by governments and other interested agencies that this extension of advertising for that is what propaganda essentially is can be readily utilized to sway and control democratic masses .

		Hereafter no government will confront its electorate without a secret or open bureau of propaganda , and every great '' interest '' will organize propaganda as an essential activity .

		-LRB- Witness the appeal of the liquor forces against the prohibition amendment to the Constitution by gravely warning the country of the danger of Bolshevism if the nation becomes dry ! -RRB-

		Already , to the cautious-minded citizen , the press has become more than suspect .

		Not that our newspapers are bought , but the news which they offer is tainted at the source and inspired by a govern - mental or other interested agency .

		By becoming merely a channel for various propaganda the press has lost much of its dignity and authority during the war .

		An ' increasingly common remark upon the daily news is , '' I guess it 's just propaganda ! ''

		The spirit of propaganda is special pleading .

		Sup - pression , distortion , as well as misrepresentation and direct falsehood , are the methods of the zealous propagandist .

		Propaganda , to be sure , kills itself , like many evil things , by its own excesses .

		Truth has a habit of struggling into men 's minds in spite of all the poison so prodigally poured out to kill it .

		In the end , public opinion clarifies itself , separating fact from propaganda but at what cost of time and of deception !

		Truth , the complete , open , unbiased truth , is the only atmosphere in which freedom can grow , in which democratic ideals can mantain them - selves .

		Therefore we should regard the propagand - ist , no matter how sincere his intentions or how good his cause , much as the hired bravo , the poisoner , or the suborner of justice , all of whose trades flour - ished when
Pope Urban VIII	ORGANIZATION	, devised this engine of mental corruption known as Propaganda .

		ROBERT
HERRICK	PERSON	.

		1919
Theodore Roosevelt	PERSON	AN THE DEATH of
Theodore Roosevelt	PERSON	the
America	LOCATION	of the generation of
1880	DATE	to
1910	DATE	lost its typical representative .

		Indeed , he was its living embodi - ment rather than its representative .

		Successful public men are not merely themselves .

		They are records and gauges of the activities and aspirations of their own day .

		It is futile to praise them or blame them except as we remember that in so doing we are appraising the time and the people that produced them .

		Hero worship of the olden type is gone , at least so far as statesmen are concerned .

		For in a democracy the people admire themselves in the man they make their hero .

		He is influential with them because he is first influential by them .

		The ordinary politician is fortunate when by dint of keeping his ear to the ground he can catch and reflect in articu - late speech the half-formed sentences of the people .

		Roosevelt did not have to resort to this undignified posture .

		He was the phonograph in whose em - phatic utterances the people recognized and greeted the collective composition of their individual voices .

		To praise or condemn
Roosevelt	PERSON	is , then , but to pass judgment on the
America	LOCATION	which suddenly awak - ened from the feverish and gigantic expenditures of energy that followed the Civil War to find itself in the face of vast problems and in need of vast reforms .

		We can better tell the qualities and defects of the period by looking at
Roosevelt	LOCATION	than in any other way .

		Through long living in the public eye he had become with extraordinary completeness a public character .

		It almost seems as if his native individu - ality , his private traits , disappeared , so wholly did they merge in the public figure .

		Of every man who goes into political life there gradually grows up a double .

		This double consists of the acts of the original individual reflected first in the imaginations and then in the desires and acts of other men .

		Just because
Roosevelt	PERSON	's capture of the imagination of his countrymen was so complete , his public double was immense , towering .

		One can not think of him ex - cept as part of the public scene , performing on the public stage .

		His ordinary and native acts gained a representative significance .

		He shook hands with a locomotive engineer , chopped down a tree at
Oyster Bay	LOCATION	, hunted big game , or wrote a magazine article on his hunting .

		Each of the acts somehow swelled with an almost ominous import .

		Each provoked applause or rebuke , enlisting the partisanships of the crowd .

		In all of these acts he was delightedly our Teddy , ours with admiring acclaim or with disgusted irritation .

		In these acts , almost equally with those of Roosevelt making a stump speech , writing a state paper , taking a canal , or sending a fleet round the world , he was the man in whom we saw our own ideals fulfilled or betrayed .

		One of the things that rankled most in the minds of those who did not like him was * that they could not get rid of him , even in the innermost recesses of their minds .

		His representative , incarnating force was such that he stayed by them .

		Everything in American life re - minded them of something which
Roosevelt	PERSON	had said or done .

		The assimilation of the private individual with the publicly assumed figure is so complete that for all except his personal intimates the former is non-existent .

		All that an outsider can say of it is that it must have been great to permit such thorough identification with the public self built up out of impacts upon others , and out of reflections back into the native self of the successes and failures , the ap - plause and dislike of others .

		Only an individuality at once mediocre and great could have become so wholly a public figure .

		In thinking of him one is never conscious of mysteries , of unexplored privacies , reticences , and reserves , hidden melancholies , or any touch of inaccessible wistfulness .

		His inherited ad - vantages of social position , comfortable wealth , edu - cation without personal struggle against obstacles , afforded external conditions from which he could launch himself the more easily , without preliminary apprenticeship and without waste of time , upon his task of representing the
America	LOCATION	of his day .

		For this
America	LOCATION	had grown self-conscious about its pioneer days of log-cabin and rail-splitter learning hardly bought by light of candle-dip .

		It wanted something less sparse and starved , something more opulent , something more obviously prosperous in cul - ture and social standing .

		It felt the struggles of the earlier day in the scars it had left behind , and rested easily only in the contemplation of a figure which never reminded it of a past which the nation for so it seemed had so happily left forever be - hind .

		It was a period of the complacent optimism born of success in overcoming obstacles , and of sub - conscious irritating memories of the shameful limita - tions involved in having such obstacles to overcome .

		Roosevelt was the
Man of Action	ORGANIZATION	.

		In that he incarnated his time .

		He preached the strenuous life and practised what he taught .

		The age was delirious with activity .

		It wanted not only action but action done with such a resounding thump and boom that all men should sit up and take notice .

		Bagehot somewhere remarked that a large part of the avoid - able evils of mankind had arisen because a number of men at some important juncture had not been able to sit quietly in a retired room until things had been thought out .

		The generation had no sympathy with THE DIAL
February 8	DATE	such a notion .

		If evils existed it was because men did not act promptly and intensely enough .

		Gordian knots exist only to be cut by the sword of sharp and vehement action .

		As soon as they are cut , we should have statistics of the number of strands , the variety of snarls , of the size of the sword and the number of foot-pounds in the blow that annihilated the difficulty .

		Refinements and subtleties and shades of distinction are not for such a period .

		To criticize
Roosevelt	PERSON	for love of the camera and the headline is childish unless we recognize that in such criticism we are condemning the very con - ditions of any public success during this period .

		A period that is devoted to action can have but one measure of success that of quantity and extent .

		This measure is essentially one of social and political reverberations .

		It can not be said that it was re - served for Roosevelt to discover the value of pub - licity for a public man .

		But he deeply divined the demand for publicity of an emphatic and command - ing kind , and he allowed no private modesty to stand in the way of furnishing it .

		When one has per - formed a resounding act it is stultifying not to allow it to resound .

		While other politicians were still trusting to the gum-shoe , it took courage as well as genial sagacity to adopt the megaphone .

		Irritated critics of
Roosevelt	ORGANIZATION	's egotism which they called megalomania overlooked the fact that a petty deed can not be made great by heralding , and that his acts commanded publicity because they were in the first place of a quality to command attention .

		Probably nothing in
Roosevelt	LOCATION	's career so won the attachment of the American people as the fact that he had the courage to take them into his confidence .

		If it now seems a ~ simple thing for a politician to make the people , in form at least , members of his own household , politically speaking , and to share with them at the breakfast table the political gossip of the day , the simplicity of the performance is evidence of the thoroughness with which
Roosevelt	PERSON	did his work .

		He established a tradition which even a man as opposite in temperament as
Wilson	PERSON	has felt obliged to follow , .

		and , whatever his practice , to make central in profession .

		Just as politicians since
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's time have studiously scanned the latter 's methods , so future statesmen will copy the style of publicity which
Roosevelt	ORGANIZATION	's courageous impetuosity created .

		Thinking out loud , or at least seeming to do so , is one of
Roosevelt	PERSON	's permanent contributions to the American political tradition .

		Lack of occa - sional spasms of frankness will henceforth be resented as evidence both of lack of courage and lack of trust in the people .

		And these will become because of Roosevelt they are already becoming the cardinal vices to a political democracy .


Roose	PERSON	- velt 's enemies repeatedly believed that he was polit - ically dead , that he had killed himself .

		Although the vehemence with which they announced his de - mise was part of a calculated technique for making their prediction true , they nevertheless sincerely be - lieved that no man could recover from what they took to be stupendous blunders such as the New Nationalism speech , the recall of judicial decisions , and so on .

		What they never understood was the admiring affection and unbounded faith with which the American people repaid one who never spoke save to make them sharers in his ideas and to appeal to them as final judges .

		Because of the power thus given him combined , of course , with his own power to learn and to grow probably no public man of any country ever equaled
Roosevelt	PERSON	in power to '' come back . ''

		Perhaps the best proof of the completeness with which
Roosevelt	PERSON	embodied the belief of his genera - tion in action , action unhesitating , untroubled by fine distinctions or over-nice scruples , is the irritation which his personality aroused in academic men .

		There are a few exceptions , but upon the whole up to the time of the Progressive campaign they fol - lowed him with distrust and only , as they felt , from compulsion of circumstances .

		A mind which ap - parently never engaged in criticism , certainly never in self-criticism , which in fact identified criticisms with instantaneous assault , was the natural opposite of the mind tangled in the timidities which result from always criticizing , and hence never acting save when external pressure compels .

		It would require a history of the life of the
United States	LOCATION	in the
last quarter of the nineteenth century	DATE	to explain how and why there developed such devoted admiration of action as action , provided only it was on a large scale .

		But that
Roosevelt	PERSON	was a great figure because he was the exponent in word and in personality of this faith there can be no doubt .

		Nor can it be doubted that power accrued to him because he exemplified his period in thinking and speaking of action exclusively in moral terms .

		And with
Roosevelt	PERSON	as with the type which adores action for its own sake , to think and to speak were synonymous .

		There are those who think that morality does not enter into action until morality has become a problem until , that is , the right course to pursue has become uncertain and to be sought for with painful reflection .

		But by this criterion
Roosevelt	PERSON	rarely if ever entered the moral sphere .

		There is no evidence that he was ever troubled by those brooding questions , those haunting doubts , which never wholly leave a man like Lincoln .

		Right and wrong were to him as distinctly and completely marked off from one another in every particular case as the blackness of
midnight	TIME	and the noonday glare .

		Nothing more endeared him to the
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 117 American people than the engaging candor with which he admitted that in the face of this immense and fixed gulf he was always to be found on the side of righteousness .

		As he repeatedly con - fessed , he '' stood '' for justice , for right , for truth , against injustice , wrong , and falsity .

		When he did not stand , he fought .

		Wherever his activities were engaged at all , he saw the combat between the forces of the Lord and of the Devil .

		The battle at
Armageddon	LOCATION	was , after all , but the consummating fight in the campaign for Righteousness in which he enlisted when he entered public life .

		And if upon the whole the moral battle was a cheery thing in which one was stimulated rather than humbled into thoughtful meditation that too reflected the moral simplicity of his generation .

		It is true , of course , that the cult of action for its own sake tends to demand for its successful pursuit either a cynical immoralism or the certainty of being on the side of the Lord .

		No politician in
America	LOCATION	can be successful beyond the local stage who takes the former course .

		The good old Anglo-Saxon habit of thinking of politics in moralistic terms was strengthened rather than weakened by its voyage across the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		Not , however , till the time of Roosevelt were economic problems treated in terms of sin and righteousness .

		` Roosevelt borrowed much from
Bryan	PERSON	, but
Bryan	PERSON	came from
Nazareth	LOCATION	in
Galilee	LOCATION	, and spoke the cruder language of the ex - horter and the itinerant revivalist .

		When
Roosevelt	PERSON	uttered like sentiments , his utterances had the color and prestige of a respectable cult and an established Church .

		It is no part of my intention to appraise what
Roosevelt	PERSON	did for our American life in the years around nineteen hundred .

		But events move rapidly , and if for a time
Roosevelt	PERSON	, as the prophet of a new social day , loomed larger than facts justi - fied , it is already easy to underestimate what we owe him .

		Positively speaking , pitifully little has been done with our industrial inequities and con - flicts .

		But in addition to what
Roosevelt	PERSON	did in arresting some of the worst tendencies of the time , he brought men to where they could behold the newer problems .

		And it is very doubtful if they could have been led to such a place by any other than the moral road , or by any one who did not spontaneously appeal to ethical convictions and en - thusiasms .

		He made the problem of economic read - justment the problem of rebuke of unrighteousness .

		He endued the cause of the reformer with the glamour of virility and vitality and all those other terms of romantic energy that come to the lips when
Roosevelt	PERSON	is spoken of .

		If under the cover of a buoyant and readily vocalized idealism , Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	took the steps which a '' practical man '' interested in success would take irrespective of moral considerations , he was in this also the embodiment of his generation of Amer - icans .

		The generation was not hypocritical and neither was he .

		Prosperity is the due reward and recognition of righteousness .

		Defeat -LRB- in that reign of moral law which Americans were brought up to feel all about them -RRB- is the sign manual of evil .

		The cause of righteousness was too precious to be compromised by the danger of defeat ; it not only needed to win but it needed the moral sanction that comes from triumph .

		And Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	's glory in the fray and his astuteness in discovering the condi - tions of success blended with his belief in righteous - ness .

		He endowed his frequent dickers with machine politicians and compromises with machine politics with a positive moral glow .

		They were to him proof that he was not as those academic reformers who profess high ideals and accomplish nothing .

		His belief in righteousness was of the sort that '' brought things to pass . ''

		He trusted and correctly enough to a certain ingrained rectitude which would pro- tect him from being compromised beyond a given point ; meantime it was the corrupt politicians who took chances , not he .

		This dualism of theoretical idealism with a too facile pragmatism in action has still to be faced in American life .

		When an epoch is closed , the following epoch is not usually generous , or even just , to it .

		What it achieved is taken for granted ; what it failed to do is the outstanding and irritating fact .

		Roosevelt 's period has not wholly passed .

		The men who fought hitn are now just beginning to '' appreciate '' him , and their acclaim mixes with the reverberations from old fights and victories .

		The fact that the old interests have , in profession at least , moved up to about where
Roosevelt	PERSON	stood in his heyday measures the progress made .

		But it also leaves him by association in a somewhat reactionary light .

		Above all , men are beginning to realize that our serious economic problems are complicated , not simple ; that they have to do with deeply rooted conditions and institutions , not with differences be - tween malefactors of great wealth and benefactors of great virtue ; and that for the most part even the most arduous fights of Roosevelt were waged with symptoms rather than with causes .

		The epoch of '' Onward , Christian Soldiers '' ended with the Progressive campaign in which it consummated .

		We are in an epoch of special problems of industrial democracy in farm and shop to which the older idealistic slogans of righteousness and the strenuous life are strangely foreign .

		Roosevelt 's '' luck '' did not desert him .

		He has been forever saved from any danger of becoming the figurehead and leader of reactionaries .

		JOHN DEWEY .

		u8 THE DIAL
February 8	DATE	The Great Tradition OR MOST American jeaders the first acquaint - ance with Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	's poetry was made in
1912	DATE	, with the publication in this country of The Ever - lasting Mercy and The Widow in the Bye Street , both written in the preceding year .

		That publica - tion marked a notable revival in the popularity of poetry in the
United States	LOCATION	, and since then a verit - able freshet of verse has run through the mill .

		Both in
England	LOCATION	and in this country there have been new poets , new subjects , fresh impulses to expression , innovations in technic , and an unfailing supply of new readers .

		An era of poetry seemed to be just breaking into dawn when the great war came threatening the annihilation of all beauty and art .

		But the war itself has sown seeds of creation as well as of destruction , and amid its horrors and fatigues has already quickened an early harvest of verse that throbs with the ardor of dauntless youth .

		Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	's plays and poems have now been collected into two crowded volumes -LRB- The Poems and Plays of
John Masefield Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 2.75	MONEY	each ,
$ 5.00	MONEY	a set -RRB- which enable us to survey as a whole the work of one of the leaders in this imagina - tive awakening of the
early years of the twentieth century	DATE	.

		As a record of literary achievement ex - tending over scarcely a single decade , these volumes must be pronounced a most impressive monument .

		In copiousness and variety , in originality and distinc - tion , in their power to seize upon our sympathies and to exalt and enlarge the scope of our imagina - tions , these plays and poems reveal a genius that is not only equal to a worthy leadership in the new movement , but is assured of a welcome among tHose who have created abiding beauty out of the English language .

		It may have been possible to maintain an attitude of skepticism or suspended judgment toward the individual productions of Mr.
Mase	PERSON	- field 's busy pen ; but the barriers of conservative criticism are swept aside by the full tide of imagi - nation , vigorous , sustained , irresistible , that sweeps through these thousand pages .

		One volume contains nine plays , two in verse Philip the King and Good
Friday	DATE	four one-aqt plays , and three tragedies in prose .

		These prose plays would excite great interest of themselves , even if their author had never written a line of verse .

		The three tragedies in particular , with their close - woven structure , and their direct and vivid dialogue , add an independent and novel page to our dramatic literature .

		There are not many authors able to evoke poignant and elevated emotion alike from the downfall of Pompey the Great , from a Japanese feud , and from the gruesome murders of an English countryside .

		But the plays even at their best are more experimental than the poems , where their out - standing virtues recur in more abundant measure .

		The passional tension , even in
Nan	ORGANIZATION	, is maintained with less certainty , and the course of the action rushes not less impetuously but more spasmodically than in the poetic narratives .

		Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	won and established his reputation by four stories in verse , all written within the space of twenty months .

		They helped to turn poetry back into the open field of narration where it has always had its greatest popularity and where , perchance , its longer pieces are destined still to find full success .

		Narrative poetry in English in the nineteenth cen - tury has been often over-weighted either by descrip - tive ornamentation or by the philosophical obsessions of the author .

		Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	had some amazing stories to tell and he told them with the onrushing sweep of one of the full-rigged ships he loves to pic - ture , bounding before a favoring wind .

		The-moral implications are plain enough , but there is no ser - monizing .

		The verse varies with the shifting mood and rises to passages of opulent beauty , but it rarely loiters over description and it never for a moment loses hold on the stirring action .

		Many readers could scarcely believe that this was poetry , for it held their minds glued to the story from its first word to the last .

		The Widow in the Bye Street and the Daffodil Fields tell of wayward passion resulting in ugly mur - der and bringing punishment to the just as well as the unjust .

		Their vivid realism is unusual , but their themes are those oft-told in verse and hence more secure of an appeal to our sympathies and offering less technical difficulties to the poet than the other tales , The Everlasting Mercy and
Dauber	PERSON	.

		The first of these tells of an unworthy rascal who cheated his friend , won a prize fight , went blind drunk , then experienced religion , and awoke to a richly unde - served happiness .

		Dauber tells of a boy who , im - pelled by an irresistible desire to become an artist , goes as ship painter on a vessel voyaging round the Horn .

		His paintings are wretched daubs and he is accidentally killed before the voyage is over , but not before his brave spirit has triumphed over frail flesh and sordid environment .

		Here are new stories told in a new way .

		That animal , man , is shown brutal , cruel , violent , and yet the abode of spiritual exaltation .

		The vocabulary of the prize ring , the alehouse , the brothel , and the forecastle mingles with words remindful of Shelley or Shake -
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 119 speare , and the terse rhythms of the crudest collo - quialisms somehow unite with a melody rich and im - pelling .

		There is never any doubt about the facts .

		You are never allowed to question whether this is actuality or illusion .

		You see the prize-fight ; you are in the midst of the tavern brawl ; you climb out on the icy yard to reef the straining sail , or you feel your soul the surprised recipient of a heavenly blessing .

		Everything is intensely real .

		In
1912	DATE	and
1913	DATE	even those of us who were not theoretical pacifists believed that this was a pacific world .

		Its villains and tyrants might still rob the poor but they would not murder and rape .

		Adven - ture lay in commerce , in science , and not in pain and battle .

		Nearly every one of Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	's tales contains a fight , and usually a brutal and horrid fight ; but we were not sure that we were any longer fighting animals .

		The life of physical violence described in the stories of
Jack London	PERSON	and in
Masefield	LOCATION	's poems seemed romantically remote from our daily experience , real enough doubtless on the frontiers of civilization , not typical of mod - ern life , but rather sensational and melodramatic .

		The war , with its terrible revelations , has brought an undesired and sudden justification to the imagi - native genius of the poet who had found in his own experience with men both the brute and the idealist , and who had seen spiritual desire linked with animal frenzy .

		We look now for a lasting peace and for a return of civilization to its more orderly ways with a renewed and surer vision of its purpose ; but it will be long before the imagination can forget the shock of battle , the anguish of flesh , the trial by combat .

		Will poetry ever be content again with `` soft Lydian airs '' or '' To sport with Amaryllis in the shade '' ?

		The sensational incidents and scenes of Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	's narratives made him appear at first as an innovator , and to some as an innovator reckless and disregardful of the idols of English poetic tra - dition .

		He faced life as he had experienced it and sought beauty in its toil and poverty , in its places of violence and sensation , such as are rarely visited by poets or modern book-readers .

		But it soon became evident that neither in the choice of subjects nor in the technic of his art was he steering a course that departed widely from the traditional path .

		He sings of the spell of the sea , of its cruelties , hard - ships , its ships and sailors , more vividly , more com - prehendingly perhaps than has any other but the sea has always roused the imagination of British poets .

		He is modern , but there is much in modern life than does not engage his interest .

		He shows none of the painstaking devotion to the poverty and drabness of the working classes which we find in the poetry of Mr.
Wilfrid Gibson	PERSON	.

		The enormous and ever-expanding technology of our modern era excites neither his wonder nor his protest .

		Railways , engi - neers , factories , and machines do not inspire him .

		His ardor is all for the square-rigged ship , never for
Macpherson	ORGANIZATION	's turbines .

		Nor does his art seek methods that are novel or that threaten revolution .

		He has not experimented with vers libre or with any of the many variations of impressionistic technic .

		The well-known measures of English verse have afforded him ample variations for an expression that has ever turned for guidance to the great mas - ters of English poetry .

		Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	has known toil and privation , but he was as surely born a man of letters and an art - ist as was
Keats	PERSON	or
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	.

		At fourteen he was indentured to a captain in the merchant marine , and there he lived the life that found expression in the Salt-Water Ballads .

		At twenty-two , after some months ashore in various employments , he was working in a carpet factory in
Yonkers	LOCATION	; and then , as he tells us , he first began '' to read poetry with passion and system . '' ''

		Chaucer was the poet and
The Parliament of Fowls	ORGANIZATION	, the poem of my con - version . ''

		After that , the factory worker crowded his evenings and
Sundays	DATE	with the wealth of Eng - lish pottry , especially Chaucer ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Milton	LOCATION	,
Shelley	PERSON	, and
Keats	PERSON	.

		One thinks of Keats in com - parison and of the '' new world of wonder and delight '' that was similarly opened to the surgeon 's apprentice .

		The two experiences are indeed strikingly alike , only the new world for
Keats	PERSON	was created not from his own contact with men , but out of old stories , the Elgin marbles , the myths , legends , and fancies that had ever swayed the heart of the poet ; while
Masefield	PERSON	found in his own experience with the passions of the sea and of un - sophisticated men the material that through the alchemy of verse might glow with the beauty of
Lamia	LOCATION	, or Adonais , or
Lear	PERSON	.

		The poetic creed he adopted in that humble
Yonkers	LOCATION	room and which he has sustained and strengthened in the following years of great achievement was the creed of the romanticist ^ only enlarged to fit a wider experience of which his own life had given him an insight .

		The poet was the .

		one divinely gifted to feel and understand * beauty hidden from less imaginative men , and the poet 's ; duty was to search ever for '' the butterflies andl petals of blossoms blowing from the unseen worU of beauty into this world . ''

		Through his per - sonality , by the processes of his creative expression '' , men 's emotions and sympathies were to be touched by these glimpses of a transcendent world .

		In his plays and tales Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	oftenest finds beauty 20 THE DIAL
February 8	DATE	in emotional ecstasy , or to use his own words in defining tragedy , '' in the agony and exultation of dreadful acts . ''

		But he finds it everywhere bright - ening experience in conversion , aspiration , in phy - sical bravery and effort , in landscape , and in his - torical associations , and in the manifold moods of '' air , earth , and skies . ''

		All had their beauty , their bright moments ' gift Their something caught from
Time	ORGANIZATION	, the ever-swift .

		The full volume of Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	's poetry is an expression of that noble text of
Wordsworth	PERSON	's which declares to us as to Toussaint : Thy friends are exultations , agonies And love , and man 's unconquerable mind .

		Many wise judges of literature will prefer some of the later poems , such as Biography , the Sonnets , or kollingdon Downs , with their more reasoned and less vehement emotion and with their more frequent reminiscences of traditional thought and imagery , to the naked rapidity of the earlier tales .

		I am not sure that I share their preference .

		In the sequence of sonnets in the Shakespearean manner , there are poems of such thoughtfulness and such perfection that they must be given high rank among examples of that form which has com - manded the best endeavors of the greatest poets ; but the difficulty of a sonnet sequence is that it calls for a continual harping on the same strings .

		Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	's crooning cadences that describe his searchings for beauty do not escape monotony .

		Beauty becomes his favorite word , like Wit in
Pope	LOCATION	and God in
Browning	LOCATION	; and after many repetitions it loses its effulgence .

		The danger of this seeking after beauty is like that of too much seeking after religion .

		The seeker comes to rely on his power to excite emotional ecstasies ; he is forever irritating his soul .

		Keats , at least in his earlier poems , found beauty through this excited sensibility , but not so did Chaucer conceive and create the
Canterbury Tales	ORGANIZATION	.

		Too much refine - ment of a phrase sometimes recalls the condemna - tion that Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	puts into the mouth of one of his unlettered women : There 's a feckless brood Goes to the devil daily ,
Joe	PERSON	, in cities Only from thinking how divine their wit is .

		The discovery of beauty , so far as it lies in poetry , depends on the variety and flexibility of art in meeting the ever-growing wealth of experience and knowledge .

		And Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	wins our ad - miration because he has mastered so wide a range of artistic means and because he has tried boldly much that art had hitherto found intractable .

		It is through a personality , vigorous , independent , in - quiring as well as sensitive , that we have been led to enlarge our sympathies and to gain a broader acquaintance with fact at the same time that we have understood '' the bright moments ' gift . ''

		In concluding testimony of Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	's great and varied power , I may recall two of the best remembered passages in all his poems the one , expressive of the fervor of '' agonies and exulta - tions , '' the other rather of brooding reverie on '' man 's unconquerable mind . ''

		After the rascal
Saul Kane	PERSON	has found the everlasting mercy he awakens to a transformed world , and his raptures are described in a torrent of images .

		He sees Christ and joy and paradise everywhere , in bird , flower , brook , railway , and plowman .

		His opened eyes see everything , well , bridge , shunting engine , hunts - man , clovertops , gipsies ' camp , one old wagon , dew - berry trailers , the young green corn , the golden harvest , '' the sea with all her ships and sails , '' the lark overhead , the cows plodding up to milking house and all these and much else focus upon '' Old Callow at his autumn ploughing , '' and this picture of useful service holds its place amid the other shifting images of damnation and salvation until it fixes itself on
Kane	PERSON	's mind as his call to work and as a symbol of his redemption .

		And in men 's hearts in many lands A spiritual ploughman stands Forever waiting , waiting now , The heart 's '' Put - in , man , zook the plough . ''

		In this wonderful passage with its richness of pic - ture and image , its sense of fact , and its emotional vitality , its rapid but constructive imagination , is there anything lacking which could add truth or beauty to the rapture of a redeemed drunkard ?

		The other passage is from
August , 1914	DATE	, the poem that hailed the opening of the great war .

		In cadence and image it is not strikingly inventive , its emotion and thought are not different from those that have ever and again stirred poet and artist , yet is it more or less beautiful than the amazing con - clusion of The ' Everlasting Mercy ?

		The poet broods over the quiet landscape , the loved Berkshire valley , the long ancestry that makes
England	LOCATION	beautiful and brave , the spirits watching over those now ready also to suffer and to die .

		And who has said all this more perfectly ?

		All the unspoken worship of those lives Spent in forgotten wars at other calls Glimmer upon these fields where evening drives Beauty like breath , so gently darkness falls .

		During the war Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	has been render - ing service at the front and through his writings .

		In a preface he speaks longingly of the peace that may release him again for the quest of the trans - cendent world of beauty known to the poets of his race , and for the effort to image more fully '' what
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 121
England	LOCATION	and the English may become , or spiritually No one will desire any diminution of idealism , are .

		or of spiritual sensitiveness in the poetry we may assuredly expect from his matured powers ; but I for one do not desire any lessening of actuality , of grip on fact , of probe into the hearts of men .

		Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	's poetry is itself witness that both idealism and beauty may be found in an enterprising as well as in an exquisite art , and through a com - prehending knowledge and faith in human will as well as by searching one 's own soul .


ASHLEY H. THORNDIKE	PERSON	.

		w Newspaper Control EVIDENCE ACCRUING FROM THE LAST CANADIAN GENERAL ELECTION HILE VAST differences of opinion with regard to the war exist in the minds of absolutely sincere men and women , there are sqme propositions , at any rate , to which practically all assent .

		One of these is the duty of seizing and preserving for future sober study every scintilla of evidence which these years have afforded as to the nature of war , its remote springs , its influence on character , and its ability to achieve what it claims to achieve .

		Upon some or all of these vital things American students of war and democracy will find valuable material in the Canadian general election of
December 17 , 1917	DATE	, fought upon the issue of conscription .

		Little news of that election filtered through into the Amer - ican press , and much of what did appear there was colored or , indeed , false .

		Prime Minister
Borden	PERSON	when in
New York	LOCATION	in the
spring of 1918	DATE	took occasion , it may be remembered , to deprecate the highly sensational despatches from north of the border as to disturbances in the Province of
Quebec	LOCATION	.

		The choice of the Canadian electors a year ago lay between the candidates of a Union Gov - ernment , headed by Sir
Robert Borden	PERSON	, and the candidates of Sir
Wilfrid Laurier	PERSON	, for some thirty years the leader of the
Canadian Liberal Party	ORGANIZATION	.

		The new
Union Government	ORGANIZATION	pledged itself to im - mediate enforcement of a compulsory military service act , passed by the Canadian Parliament a few months previously , while Sir
Wilfrid Laurier	PERSON	undertook , if returned to power , to consult the electorate upon the question by way of a referen - dum , pledging himself to enforce conscription if the referendum carried .

		The conscription issue drove a wedge into the ranks of the Canadian Liberals and many threw in their lot with that of the
Union Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		The latter had been formed during the
fall of 1917	DATE	, but not without deep heart-searching , much running to and fro between
Ottawa	LOCATION	and the provincial capitals , refrac - tory conventions , and the intriguing of political Warwicks .

		To Sir
Wilfrid Laurier	PERSON	a large sec - tion of his followers remained true .

		Among the faithful were former federal ministers , provincial ministers , and members both of the
Canadian House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	and of provincial legislatures .

		The
Canadian Labor Party	ORGANIZATION	, newly formed , elected to make common cause with the Liberals .

		Hopes of a Laurier victory , almost to the eve of the polling , were widely entertained .

		The veteran statesman traveled in midwinter from one end of the Dominion to the other and was given everywhere an ovation the warmth of which is probably without a parallel in Canadian political history .

		Although in the end overwhelmingly defeated ,
Laurier	ORGANIZATION	had a popular majority in two of the eight English-speaking Provinces .

		In the
Province of Quebec	ORGANIZATION	there was a Laurier landslide , his candi - dates securing sixty - two out of the sixty-five seats .

		A determined attempt in the three Provinces to drive the Laurier candidates from the field proved unsuccessful .

		With unimportant exceptions they stood to their guns , often without any political machinery , and went to the polls .

		Taking the English-speaking Provinces as a whole , Laurier polled more than one vote in three .

		In these Prov - inces 780,141 votes were cast for the
Borden	LOCATION	candi - dates , and 461,592 for the Laurier candidates , while 35,581 votes were cast for
Labor	ORGANIZATION	candidates either opposed to conscription or in favor of a referendum .

		Opposition to conscription had been shared up to the middle of
1917	DATE	by the vast majority of the Canadian people , by the majority of the Canadian newspapers , and by the majority of
Canada	LOCATION	's public men .

		But how did Laurier fare at the hands of the press when the election campaign came along a few months later ?

		In the eight English-speaking Provinces there were in existence at the time thirty-three daily newspapers , each with a ` circula - tion of over 10,000 according to official returns .

		These thirty-three , newspapers comprise practically the whole daily press of the larger cities .

		They include all
Canada	LOCATION	's large and well established dailies in the English Provinces .

		In politics thirteen of these newspapers officially described themselves as `` Conservative '' or `` Independent Conservative ; '' eleven as `` Liberal '' or `` Independent Liberal , '' and 122 THE DIAL
February 8	DATE	nine as `` Independent . ''

		Now consider the follow - ing facts : Nine of the eleven Liberal or Independent Liberal dailies which had supported Laurier in previous cam - paigns deserted him .

		In the whole of
English-speaking Canada Laurier	ORGANIZATION	had three dailies with a circulation of over 10,000 , and his opponent thirty .

		In
Ontario	LOCATION	, the most populous Province of
Canada	LOCATION	,
Laurier	ORGANIZATION	had the support of one daily of over 10,000 circulation and his opponents of nine .

		In the
Maritime Provinces of New Brunswick	ORGANIZATION	and
Nova Scotia Laurier	LOCATION	had not a single newspaper of the size stated .

		His opponents had six .

		-LRB- In
New Brunswick Laurier	ORGANIZATION	polled 44 per cent of the vote and in
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	51 per cent . -RRB-

		in five out of the eight English-speaking Prov - inces , namely ,
British Columbia	LOCATION	,
Saskatchewan	LOCATION	,
Manitoba	LOCATION	,
New Brunswick	LOCATION	, and
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	, Laurier had not a single daily of over 10,000 circu - lation .

		His opponents had fourteen , six of which were former
Laurier	ORGANIZATION	organs .

		In the cities of
Toronto	LOCATION	-LRB- capital of
Ontario	LOCATION	-RRB- ,
Winnipeg	LOCATION	-LRB- capital of
Manitoba	LOCATION	-RRB- ,
Vaucouver	PERSON	,
B. C.	PERSON	,
Ottawa	LOCATION	-LRB- capital of the Dominion -RRB- ,
Regina	PERSON	-LRB- capital of
Saskatchewan	LOCATION	-RRB- ,
Saskatoon	LOCATION	,
Sask.	LOCATION	,
Hamilton	LOCATION	,
Ont.	LOCATION	,
St. John	LOCATION	,
N.B.	LOCATION	, and
Halifax	LOCATION	-LRB- capital of
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	-RRB- , Laurier was without a single daily of the size mentioned .

		In the same cities his opponents had twenty-six such dailies .

		I have already said that Laurier swept the French Province of
Quebec	LOCATION	.

		Naturally the news - paper situation in this Province does not present the phenomenon that characterizes it in the English - speaking portion of the
Dominion	ORGANIZATION	.

		But the posi - tions were not reversed .

		In
Montreal	LOCATION	and
Quebec City	LOCATION	both sides had the assistance of strong dailies and no newspaper in the
Province of Quebec	ORGANIZATION	, as far as I am aware , changed its coat before the election .

		When Sir
Robert Borden	PERSON	, on
May 18 , 1917	DATE	, in - troduced his conscription measure into the
Canadian House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	, four days after his return from a visit to
Great Britain	LOCATION	, the news came to the Canadian people like a bolt from the blue .

		For no hint of conscription had been dropped by any mem - ber of Sir
Robert	PERSON	's Government when the Canadian Prime Minister left
Canada	LOCATION	for
London	LOCATION	early in
February , 1917	DATE	.

		In the
spring of 1916	DATE	not much more than a year before the announcement of con - scription Sir
Robert	PERSON	said in the
Canadian Parlia	LOCATION	- ment : In speaking in the first two or three months of this war I made it clear to the people of
Canada	LOCATION	that we did not propose conscription .

		I repeat that announcement today with emphasis .

		The chief newspapers of
Canada	LOCATION	, especially the Liberal newspapers , had pronounced strongly against conscription .

		Thus , in
July , 1916	DATE	, the
Toronto Globe	ORGANIZATION	said editorially :
The Globe	ORGANIZATION	in its editorial columns has consistently pointed out that in a country such .

		as
Canada	LOCATION	conscription is an impossibility , and that no responsible statesman of either party , capable of forming or leading a war ministry , would propose compulsory service .

		The
Manitoba Free Press	ORGANIZATION	, the largest news - paper in
Western Canada	LOCATION	, spoke even more strongly .

		It expressed the view that conscription would mean one half of
Canada	LOCATION	garrisoning the other half .

		After and not before Sir
Robert Borden	PERSON	announced his policy of conscription did he invite Sir
Wilfrid Laurier	PERSON	to enter a
Union Govern	ORGANIZATION	- ment .

		Is it not strange that Canadian newspapers which in the
fall months of 19	DATE	* 17 were pouring abuse on
Laurier	ORGANIZATION	's head and insulting both his can - didates and his followers , were able , a few weeks earlier , to see the unfairness of expecting Laurier to enter a cabinet committed to a policy to which he had been a lifelong opponent ?

		Consider , for example , this remarkably frank editorial utterance from the
Manitoba Free Press	ORGANIZATION	of
June 12 , 1917	DATE	: It is impossible to regard the situation as it affects Sir
Wilfrid Laurier	PERSON	without mixed feelings of indigna - tion and regret .

		It is less than five months ago since
R. B. Bennett	PERSON	-LSB- at that time a member of the
Borden	PERSON	cabinet -RSB- , who presumably spoke with knowledge , told a meeting of
Winnipeg	LOCATION	citizens that conscription meant bloodshed in
Quebec	LOCATION	and was not politically practicable .

		... Sir
Wilfrid	PERSON	was put in an impossible position by the tactics of Sir
Robert Borden	PERSON	.

		The theory that it was intended to destroy Laurier was by no means far - fetched .

		It may well have been calculated that Sir Wil - frid , when confronted with the inevitable division of the party , would retire from public life .

		Within two or three months of printing the editorial from which the foregoing is taken , the
Manitoba Free Press	ORGANIZATION	had thrown over Sir
Wilfrid Laurier	PERSON	, whose policies it had supported for nearly a quarter of a century , and was enthusiastically backing the new
Union Government	ORGANIZATION	headed by Sir
Robert Borden	PERSON	.

		Later the same newspaper said : For the young man who is liable to the draft to vote for Laurierism is a confession in his own soul , no matter by what high-sounding phrases he disguises the truth , that he is yellow .

		Efforts put forth to split the
Liberal Party	ORGANIZATION	met with a large measure of success .

		Two methods were in the main relied on , one the gaining control of the Laurier newspapers , and the other , the rais - ing of a racial and religious issue .

		Nevertheless , the first attempts to stampede the Liberals into the
Union Government	ORGANIZATION	fold were ill-starred .

		Con - ventions called in the Province of
Ontario	LOCATION	for the purpose of repudiating Laurier either endorsed him or produced negative results .

		It was after these failures that strong influences were felt to be abroad for the control of the Liberal newspapers .

		At this time the
fall of 1917	DATE	desperate attempts were
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 123 being made to form a union government .

		To induce prominent Liberals to enter the proposed coalition was proving extremely difficult .

		A conference of Liberal leaders held at
Winnipeg	LOCATION	demanded as the condition of their espousal of union government the resignation of Sir
Robert Borden	PERSON	, the conference submitting the names of four prominent Canadians from whom the new prime minister was to be chosen .

		This overture was summarily rejected by the friends of Sir
Robert Borden	PERSON	.

		During these days many of the Liberal papers which afterwards fell into line behind the
Union Government	ORGANIZATION	were having their daily jest at Liberal leaders reported to be considering the offer of a cabinet position .

		But the silencing of the press supporting Sir
Wilfrid Laurier	PERSON	was nevertheless accomplished .

		Al - though tragic enough to the Liberals remaining true to
Laurier	ORGANIZATION	, the situation had much in it that was comic .

		The transition from ridiculing union gov - ernment to supporting it had in some cases to be made in unceremonious haste and under the rude gaze of astonished onlookers .

		Editorials supporting Laurier halted on the printing presses .


Ottawa	LOCATION	correspondence favoring him stopped on the wires .

		When it was all over ,
Laurier	LOCATION	, Prime Minister of
Canada	LOCATION	through four successive administrations , was without a newspaper press in the English Provinces .

		During the election campaign the cry that French Nationalism and Roman Catholicism were threatening the vitals of
Canada	LOCATION	was assiduously spread .

		The idea of civil war was on the lips of many whose position might have suggested the duty of conciliation between
Canada	LOCATION	's two great races .

		To a friend of mine , a respected citizen of
Winnipeg	LOCATION	, a cabinet minister in the Government of
Manitoba	LOCATION	, said : ''
Quebec	LOCATION	has got to be licked and it might as well be now as later . ''

		I had in my hands the original of a letter sent by one
Alberta	LOCATION	farmer 's wife to another .

		It ran : How do we feel about the election ?

		Well , we feel that the real Canadians showed the good stuff they are made of , and showed those Frenchmen where they be - longed .

		They had to do that in spite of the fact that it would bring conscription , and though this conscription bill may take my husband .

		Intimidation of Laurier voters was a general condition .

		His right-hand men were read out of public life forever by former Laurier organs .

		A vote for
Laurier	ORGANIZATION	was held up in the press not mere - ly as the acme of disloyalty , but as a piece of down - right iniquity .

		The terrors of the living and the dead were threatened against those who were will - ing to risk conscription on a referendum .

		No chances were taken .

		Any Canadian coming to
Canada	LOCATION	from an enemy country during the previous fifteen years , no matter how long a citizen of the
Dominion	ORGANIZATION	, was by law disfranchised .

		On the other hand a special military franchise was created under which the wife , mother , daughters , or sisters of a soldier were given a vote , all other women remain - ing as before unenfranchised .

		From practically every Protestant pulpit con - gregations were exhorted to vote for
the Union Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		Colonel -LRB- the Rev. Dr. -RRB-
Chown	PERSON	, General Superintendent of the
Methodist Church	ORGANIZATION	in
Canada	LOCATION	, issued an encyclical in which the follow - ing appeared : We must inquire what effect each ballot will have upon Christian civilization as opposed to undiluted bar - barism , upon heaven as in contrast with hell .

		The question , it seems to me , which should interest American students of war and of this war , is : What induced the Liberal papers of
Canada	LOCATION	to forsake Sir
Wilfrid Laurier	PERSON	?

		Was it , simply an honest change of opinion ?

		Had the reasons which prompted them strongly to condemn conscription in
1916	DATE	disappeared in
1917	DATE	?

		Personally I do not believe that an affirmative answer can honestly be given to these questions .

		It is quite true that a considerable number of Canadians sincerely believed that a
Union Government	ORGANIZATION	was desirable .

		Again , a certain number of Canadians , chiefly elderly gentlemen well beyond the draft age , had advocated conscription .

		But it is equally true that the idea of conscription was alien to the Canadian people .

		The suspicion is also justified that in many minds a
Union Government	ORGANIZATION	, with Sir
Robert Borden	PERSON	retained as its head , was preferable to the accession of the Liberals to office .

		Of the
Borden Government	ORGANIZATION	whose term had expired , the
Manitoba Free Press	ORGANIZATION	said : Had it gone to the coun - try in a party fight it would have met with an over - whelming defeat .

		The quick and unceremonious switching from
Laurier to Union Government	ORGANIZATION	which I have de - scribed does not suggest a genuine change of heart , and many other things do not suggest it either .

		What was it , then ?

		Frankly , I do not know , but I do know that ever since the election there has been a profound conviction in the minds of large numbers of Canadians that something happened a year ago which has never yet been explained .

		This belief persists in
Canada	LOCATION	and was never more alive than at the present moment .

		A few things may be noted .

		On
May 17	DATE	last , in the
Canadian House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Lucien Cannon	PERSON	, a French member , speaking in a debate on Taxation , asked : . ''

		How are those millionaires who bought and bribed the press of this country during the last election taxed ? ''

		Mr.
Cannon	PERSON	was roundly denounced for this utter - ance and it must be confessed that he produced no evidence in support of it .

		The
Voice	ORGANIZATION	, a
Winnipeg Labor	ORGANIZATION	weekly , said editorially on
Dec. 4 , 1917	DATE	, three I 24
February 8 days	DATE	before the polling : `` Wherein then lies the significance of this frenzied campaign ?

		It coincides with the visit to
Ottawa	LOCATION	weeks ago of the biggest autocrat of the press in the world Lord North - cliffe . ''

		His lordship 's visit to
Canada	LOCATION	certainly left behind it a crop of rumors , and one may note with interest that the
Toronto Globe	ORGANIZATION	went to some pains to prove that its stock , at any rate , had no Northdiffian taint .

		There is another powerful figure in British politics whose moves are regarded by large numbers of Canadians with distrust and suspicion .

		I refer to Lord
Beaverbrook	PERSON	, whose rapid accumulation of wealth through the '' organization '' of the Canadian cement merger a few years ago by no means en - hanced his reputation in his native Dominion .

		Shortly after the Canadian general election Prime Minister
Lloyd George	PERSON	, in the
British House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	, spoke of the marvelous success which had attended the propaganda work of Lord
Beaverbrook	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Lloyd George	PERSON	unfortunately did not specify to what particular '' success '' he had reference , but the context seemed plainly to indicate that the tri - umph of the
Union Government	ORGANIZATION	in
Canada	LOCATION	was what the Prime Minister had in his mind . '

		Ever since the election assertions of independence have been appearing in the Canadian newspapers .

		I have before me as I write , half a dozen editorials , clipped from the few Canadian dailies which come into my hands , all protesting journalistic honor .

		One from the
Toronto Globe	ORGANIZATION	strongly condemns the President of the
United Farmers of Ontario	ORGANIZATION	for remarks about the Canadian '' subsidized press '' made to a gather - ing of several thousand farmers .

		The editorial proceeds to preach a little homily on the robust in - dependence and absolute integrity of
Canada	LOCATION	's lead - ing newspapers .

		Since then , however , on
Oct. 5	DATE	last , to be exact ,
the Toronto Globe	ORGANIZATION	has had to admit that all is not as it should be in Canadian journalism .

		In a
Montreal	LOCATION	court case it came out that two evening papers in that city , the Star and the
Herald	ORGANIZATION	, although differing in politics , were under the same ownership .

		Commenting upon this the
Globe	ORGANIZATION	said : The
Herald	ORGANIZATION	, with a long history as a Liberal paper , was acquired a few years ago by Lord Atholstan of the staunchly Conservative Star .

		The union ended a bit - ter quarrel between the Star and the
Herald	ORGANIZATION	over issues not unrelated to
Lord Atholstan	ORGANIZATION	's interest in certain municipal franchises .

		Since then they have been in serene and perfect agreement on civic questions , but they maintain their party differences ... Many citi - zens will not regard it as an ideal condition that the control of the English press in the
evening	TIME	field of a great city like
Montreal	LOCATION	should be in one man 's hands .

		The
Kingston Whig	LOCATION	, another
Ontario	LOCATION	daily , in an editorial quoted by
the Toronto Globe	ORGANIZATION	on
June 27 last	DATE	, said : Here and there rumors still persist that the prers of
Canada	LOCATION	' , which almost unanimously supported
Union Government	ORGANIZATION	, did so from the basest and lowest motives that , in fact , it was bought with a price .

		The Whig 's editorial went on to denounce those who spread such rumors and declared that '' The press of the country supported Union Gov - ernment ... for a principle , not for mercenary gain . ''

		It is worth while noting that in one or two instances there was concrete evidence that the switch from
Laurier	ORGANIZATION	had been made reluctantly .

		The
Regina Leader	PERSON	, for example , was one of the papers that made a rapid transit from the Laurier to the
Union Government	ORGANIZATION	camp .

		But in the opinion of the
Manitoba Free Press	ORGANIZATION	there was still some hank - ering after the fleshpots of
Egypt	LOCATION	in the editorial , office of the Leader , for the former , during the elec - tion campaign , accused its contemporary of duplicity .

		It said : The Leader 's idea of fighting for the Unionist cause is to give it a transparently hypocritical support upon the editorial page and to knife it in every other column of the paper .

		Canadian newspapermen of standing with whom I conversed recently , assured me that the editors and editorial writers on the newspapers which deserted Laurier were spiritually coerced and yielded to influences which they found irresistible .

		I pressed these Canadian journalists for a careful estimate of the proportion of editors and editorial writers who were , in their opinion , thus coerced and left Laurier reluctantly .

		They assured me that it amounted to ninety per cent , and they pro- ceeded to name to me editors and editorial writers who , in their opinion , would beyond question have supported Laurier had they felt free to do so .

		I believe that in the foregoing I have revealed a condition of journalism which is thoroughly un - healthy and under which neither the press of
Canada	LOCATION	nor that of any other country can truly serve the people .

		Just what the solution * is I do not pretend to know .

		I simply offer the above as evidence worthy of serious study by those who wish to see the press a greater factor in human progress .

		Since I began this article a statement recently made in the Westminster Gazette by Mr.
J. A. Spender	PERSON	, a prominent British journalist , has come under my notice .

		I am disposed to think it throws some light upon the Canadian situation .

		I will close by quot - ing it .

		It reads as follows : The public would be astonished if it knew how few writers are regularly engaged in political journalism in these times and how little opportunity there is for the exercise of a free judgment ... During the thirty - three years during which I have been connected with journalism I have seen the power of the editor con - stantly diminishing and the power of the proprietor con - stantly increasing .

		Crystal cold and thin The ancient measures flow , While a dragon-fly , Perched , like a painted eagle , On a pygmy pine , Listens in silence .

		H. H. BELLAMANN .

		Anatole
France	LOCATION	and the Imp of the Perverse J.HERE CAME to a dreaming boy in a Parisian bookshop a good fairy who touched his lips with the '' honey of romance . ''

		< She was akin to the sprightly fairy who teased the boy as an old man , and she was first cousin to the salamander who loved for a time the pupil of
Jerome Coignard	PERSON	.

		She brought to life little leaden soldiers and many other myths .

		She nourished the boy in naive and gentle imaginings , persuading him that nothing exists save by imagination which is why she existed .

		They played together in the Jardin des Plantes and formed a bowing acquaintance with Latin heroes .

		The fairy heard the terrible prophecy : '' You will always be occupied with things not pertaining to class - work , '' and she consoled her friend by endowing him with a sincere and lasting beauty-worship .

		All his life the boy dreamed of a lovely villa by a blue lake , of classic repose and conversations .

		In his first maturity , he came to feel a gay dilettantism , an optimistic zest for life , a mild irony which assuages it .

		Irony and pity were the rules of his order ; a blithe humor could be wedded with a love for all noble and generous things .

		When the boy is called
Bonnard	PERSON	, his
Abbaye de Theleme	ORGANIZATION	includes gentleness to animals , Unobtrusive acts of kindness , care for people 's feelings , the charm of early sou - venirs .

		It includes indignant action in behalf of justice and it enshrines vistas and breezes from the garden of Epicurus .

		Thus the good fairy seemed to have gifts for every age : `` desires and adorations , winged per - suasions and veiled destinies . ''

		.

		Everything was found in
Pandora	ORGANIZATION	's box , except Hope , who flew out of the window ; in her place came a character whom I shall call the Imp of the
Perverse	LOCATION	; he sat grin - ning on the edge of the box and said to
Anatole France	LOCATION	: '' Do you really think you can get through on that schedule ?

		Your deliberate dilettantism means love for the beautiful but it also means hatred for the ugly .

		You will come to hate more than you love and your irony will grow bitter and your Evolution will become Fate and your desire sensuality .

		You will no longer admire the lofty gestures of the Romanticists and you will see that classic art is largely a legend .

		History , you will perceive , is either archeological and keeps the life out , or it is imaginative and keeps the truth out .

		You have read so much ,
Bonnard	LOCATION	, that you know that Relativity is the only extract of truth which is beneficial to the health .

		There is really no knowl - edge , no ethics , no esthetics .

		Therefore you re - nounce your old allegiance , speaking of artistry as doll-making and of religious traditions as largely Satanic . ''

		But -
Anatole Jerome Bonnard Bergeret	ORGANIZATION	declared .

		that the beautiful still existed , epitomized in the love of women .

		He would not forget the fair - haired
Clementine	PERSON	of his boyhood , and he would cherish the image of Dido , wandering in the myrtles with her immortal wound .

		He would still see Thai 's the actress as '' a lovely statue , sweet and proud , communicating to all the tragic thrill of beauty . ''

		He would dwell , in his fancy , with
Madame de Gromance	ORGANIZATION	, '' flower-eyed , empty of thought , and therefore more desirable . ''

		As an old philosopher he contemplated with delight the winsomeness of a street-girl , and he approved the stark passion of the lovers in his '' Lys Rouge . ''

		For he held that the
Venus of Milo	PERSON	is really symbolic of
Voluptas	LOCATION	, of creative life , and sensualism is a good thing , making for the grandeur and value of man , inspiring all art .

		The Imp leered in assent . ''

		I taught you that !

		Illusion and sense are the foundations of creative beauty but they are contradictory .

		Among Pagans and
Penguins	PERSON	love was a simple , unimportant pleas - Illusion came with the seven veils of
Chris	PERSON	- ure .

		tianity and civilization .

		When the
Church	ORGANIZATION	made love a sin , you have said , the
Church	ORGANIZATION	created its
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 127 charm and mystery .

		It 's not the fault of women that men prolong a simple unit into infinity , and
Madame de Gromance	ORGANIZATION	, who hardly speaks to you anyhow , has no use for your ideal admiration .

		There is much perversity in the way women follow the forceful and brutal , only to swerve away when their heroes become tender .

		So Thais follows Paphnuce to the desert ; so
Chevalier	PERSON	and
Balthasar	PERSON	are cruelly deserted when they truly love .

		For the sensual law is cruel , your pleasure is somber , the act of love is really a sign of death , arrd pleasure in beauty comes to be a sharp pain . ''

		The good fairy had long since disappeared .

		It seemed to the great ironist , watching the tossing waves of illusion , that the Epicurean was still the only way .

		It was the way of the ancients and the friends of Thai 's .

		They teach us to adapt happiness to our paltry condition , they maintain the innocence and the w r orth of joy .

		Combining this with the simplicity of St.
Francis	PERSON	, thought the brooding phil - osopher , we are left with the master-keys of Irony and Pity , the charitable skepticism of the Abbe Coignard .

		There is one thing further about the Epicurean garden : it should not be cultivated , for that is an act , and action is almost as deadly as thought .

		The Imp retorted : `` Then why do you think ? ''

		Conceding the inhumanity of thought , Anatole thought further that this self-questioning carries on the world through the grace of the goddess
Maia	PERSON	.

		This earth is a spectacle in which ignorance and folly are the true forces ; whereas truth is single and inert , illusion is multiple , moral , and individual .

		The races live by their harmless mythologies , and nothing really exists save my thought .

		That is why I should send my imaginative adventures forth as criticism , my impressions as science , my reactions as a creed .

		Let us accept universal prejudices , remem - bering further that the universe is as incoherent as a novel by
Anatole France	LOCATION	.

		As clouds dissolving are the appearances of life ; it is a succession of ruins , changes , miseries .

		To think that we should people other planets !

		The Imp rejoined , choosing always from Ana - tole 's own words : `` That is what you think , Ber - geret , when discouraged .

		But when you are called to the
Sorbonne	LOCATION	, you brighten up and consider that
Sirius	ORGANIZATION	might very .

		well be populated by Bergerets .

		Besides , you accept the likelihood of the Eternal Return ; in all the permutations of worlds ,
A. France	LOCATION	has been , is , and will be again your
Goubin	PERSON	is wiping , has wiped , and will wipe his glasses through all eternity .

		Progress , of course , is illusory except when we see it .

		Inventions are the defor - mations of the herd except when our advantages over our forefathers allow us to perceive how little we are superior to them .

		Science merely adds spec - tacles to our poor eyes , prolongs and multiplies our ignorance through knowledge . '' ''

		Exactly ! ''

		said Anatole . ''

		And thereby furnishes a desirable criterion for progress .

		Tell us how you work for progress . ''

		Anatole then wearily repeated that knowledge was pure foolishness and metaphysics so much '' romancing . ''

		Because there are no absolutes , there can be no real justice .

		And as for humanitarian .

		Positivism , '' the great fetish scarcely seems to me adorable . '' ''

		Yet , '' said the Imp , '' you are always contending for positivism in other fields whenever you are not contending for illusion .

		The fact is ,
Anatole	LOCATION	, that , like poor Flaubert , you were always at seesaw be - tween realism and romanticism .

		You were playing Truth , He wins Beauty , I lose .

		It 's a good thing that
Dreyfus	ORGANIZATION	came along to set you straight . '' ''

		It 's all Illusion , '' said
Anatole	PERSON	, staring gloomily at his tormentor . ''

		Where do I show any taste for positive realities ? ''

		`` Everywhere !

		In love , religion , politics , and philosophy .

		You find that justice is utilitarian and you regret it .

		You make everything depend on hunger and love and you think it 's a shame .

		You rationalize
Joan	PERSON	of Arc , you materialize the impulses of chivalry , you think that killing is an ordinary human enterprise , you see history as a crude mess .

		But are you satisfied with all this ?

		You once said that your mind contained both
Sancho Panza	PERSON	and
Don Quixote	PERSON	, and I think
Don Quixote	PERSON	is still there .

		Your cynicism is really a disappointed ideal - ism , as I could amply prove , you mocking
Benedic	PERSON	- tine , from your whole attack on religion , of which it would scarcely become me to speak .

		Let us take politics .

		And Think ! ''

		Avoiding that main issue , the Voltairian then submitted a few of his neatest paradoxes , trusting thereby to appease the Imp .

		He described life as '' delicious , horrible , charming , bitter , '' and himself as amused by its contradictions , interested in epochs of conflict like the Alexandrian and the eighteenth century .

		Life is evidently ill-arranged , for youth should come at the close , climactically ; butterflies do not need to cry , like the dying dauphin , '' Fi de la vie ! ''

		But why try to adjust anything ?

		Beneficence has been spoiled by the Pharisees , charity is mothered by pride , and the improvement of man can only be forwarded by his extinction .

		The Rousseauists carry him back to monkeydom and become indignant when the monkey does not behave .

		On the other hand , the Declaration of Rights would establish an '' excessive and iniquitous separation between man 128 THE DIAL
February 8	DATE	and the gorilla . ''

		It is easy to show that great sinners become great saints , that neighbors are natu - ral enemies , that Blue Beard was a henpecked genial gentleman , and that
Pilate	ORGANIZATION	might readily forget the episode of Christ .

		His own works , insisted the novelist , were de - signed to show this world as one huge paradox .

		In Thai 's , a woman is carried from happiness to misery by the illusions of a bigot ; he renounces the illusions as she swims to heaven on their wings .

		In the Revoke des Anges , the angels become men of the world , the devils become angels .

		The
Histoire Comique	ORGANIZATION	is a tragic story , the Abbe Coignard dies with gay songs on his lips , the man who married a dumb wife has the tables turned on him and turns them again .

		There is the juggler who offers his art to Our Lady ; there is a whole library called in to witness a kiss .

		In
Les Dieux Ont Soif	ORGANIZATION	, we see the underside of the Revolution , in which the author none the less believes , and among the Penguins there are accumulated climaxes and anticlimaxes .

		Anatole sighed . ''


Henry James	PERSON	once told me that the only thing my intellect left standing was itself . '' ''

		I should like , '' said the Imp pointedly , '' to hear your views on politics . ''

		It seemed to Anatole that his satires on democ - racy had settled that point .

		Had he not shown that liberty , equality , and the like were unrealizable or undesirable fetishes ?

		Had he not shown that the state really subsists through the wisdom of a few strong statesmen and that the best thing to be said for the Republic is '' Elle gouverne peu '' ?

		Had he not given dozens of cases where fraud , vice , and self-interest moved both the Dreyfusards and their opponents ?

		Popular governments are self-enslaved , weak through their lack of secrecy , their poor ser - vants , their whole '' turbulent menagerie . ''

		The Imp inquired : '' Do you like our aristocrats , then , our ' god-given hierarchies ? ' ''

		It is a great irony that so much power was wielded by the Royalists and Nationalists , who were weaker-brained than those whom they oppressed . ''

		Thus spoke
M. Bergeret	PERSON	, professor of eloquence at the Sofbonne .

		And he passed the sponge of universal raillery over the established classes the nobles , the bourgeois , the bureaucrats , the military , the clergy .

		He jeeringly asked how two French war councils could possibly be wrong in the
Dreyfus	ORGANIZATION	affair .

		He thought it fortunate that the state really subsists not through the wisdom of a few strong statesmen , but through the needs of sev - eral million lowly workers . ''

		You are really more at war with institutions and organizations than with the people , '' said the Imp slowly . ''

		Why did you come out for
Drey	PERSON	- fus ? '' ''

		Because I could never stand by and see injustice done !

		I hold that all fetters will fall before a single just idea .

		The greatest compliment I received in the Affair was when a workman told me : ' You have come out of your caste and you have not wished to fraternize with the defenders of the saber and the holy-water sprinklers . '

		There is no paradox in the bond of the proletariat and the intellectuals .

		With whom do you wish that thinkers and artists should consort ?

		With the sly blind calloused bour - geoisie ? '' ''

		Go on ! ''

		said the Imp . ''

		The education of the people has scarcely begun , but it is better to have a clean sheet than one scrawled over with the wrong prejudices .

		And the workmen are in earnest about what they learn witness the night schools ; whereas the lackadaisical sons of the bourgeois avoid education as a pest .

		Vital enthusiasm heart !

		Down with luxury ! '' ''

		And you declare , '' the Imp took him up , '' that your dream of the future is the true evolutionary dream , because it is founded on economic history , and always wise thinkers have been the masons of the future .

		Barring your attenuations and my per - versities , you see Socialism as truth , goodness , and justice , and the greatest of these is justice .

		You believe that through the first Revolution
France	LOCATION	owes herself to 7 the world .

		You see the confused movements of modern labor as tending towards universal peace and unity .

		You say that after the world conflagration the monster of militarism will burst from obesity .

		You have even constructed a somewhat mechanical Utopia , like Wells .

		And when it comes to the Great War '' the Imp sank his voice , and
Anatole France	LOCATION	looked at him uneas - ily . ''

		When it comes to the Great War , you have uttered nothing which is not perfectly human , just and banal .

		You have shown the sense , feeling , and patriotism which are now common among UP .

		You have spoken of the ancient town whose ' robe of stone ' has been violated , you have execrated .

		the Satanic science that was arrayed against us , you have defended with your great pen our ideals , traditions , genius .

		And like the rest of us , you will have no peace until this horror is conjured forever from the human horizon . ''

		Anatole
France	LOCATION	looked at the speaker in great wonder and bewilderment . ''

		You , my other self , have made me say all this .

		Who are you , brother ? ''

		And the Imp of the Perverse answered : '' My other name is the
Spirit of Reality	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		E.
PRESTON DARGAN	PERSON	.

		1919 THE DIAL 129 The American Press Since the Armistice UNDERSTAND the temper and direction of American newspaper opinion since that far-away day ,
November	DATE	n ,
1918	DATE	, it is imperative briefly to review the public opinion of this country for the period just before the end of hostilities .

		When the armistice actually came , the American press like the American public was intellectually unprepared for it ; for nineteen months we had been living in a fictitious and unreal world of war hysteria , and the corrective of suffering had as yet been only feebly administered .

		Quite aside from the
Espion	PERSON	- age Act , which of itself inevitably forced a homo - geneity of opinion , the American press as a whole merely reflected the mood of the country that the Germans were devils in human form and the begin - ning and end of all things were to smash them .

		The good man , bad man theory of our regular political life our manner of carrying over religious emotions into political contests , otherwise purely formal struggles between the '' ins '' and the '' outs '' had successfully given the direction to popular conceptions of foreign policy .


Germany	LOCATION	became the unregenerate and wicked sinner nation -LRB- or in more nai 've minds , the
Kaiser	PERSON	, as a symbol of his nation -RRB- , and our war problem was the really simple problem of how to crush that nation .

		President
Wilson	PERSON	's attempt to distinguish between the German Govern - ment and the German people had never really fired popular imagination ; indeed , even if it had , our patriotic organizations throughout the country would have seen to it that the distinction was quickly forgotten .

		Since long before the armistice most of our regular newspapers had merely aped the worst form of current Northcliffian vulgarity : the ignor - ance and provincialism of the ordinary newspaper editor 's views of foreign relations was almost as ludicrous as the German foreign office 's idea of the psychology of the American people .

		Propagandists , like
Cheradame	PERSON	-LRB- now busily attacking the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	and threatening to undermine President
Wilson	PERSON	by appealing to disgruntled Republican Sen - ators in
America	LOCATION	to start a backfire against him -RRB- were gravely accepted as prophets , just as the weekly discussions of the '' military experts '' were taken seriously by many good citizens .

		The liberal news - papers as , for instance , the
Evening Post of New York	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- before its change of ownership -RRB- , and the
Springfield	LOCATION	Republican and the liberal magazines were frightened into timidity by the wave of mass opinion .

		To suggest that any of the Allies , or rather , that any of the members of the Governments of the Allies , had anything except the purest and highest of motives was -LRB- aside from the possibility of letting oneself in for a term in jail -RRB- to be guilty of vile pro-Germanism .

		Even to suggest , on the other hand , that
Germany	LOCATION	might have a revolution was regarded dubiously , for there was a kind of hidden fear of a real revolution in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		All newspapers gave lip service to the revolution and announced that if it did happen they would welcome it ; actually they feared it , and hence said it was im - possible .

		For a revolution would have meant the end of the war , and hardly anyone really wanted the war to end just when it did .

		Even pacifists , if they are honest , will confess that the sudden termina - tion of hostilities was somewhat irritating .

		There is a deep instinct in all of us which resents making elaborate preparations for something which does n't happen , even if that something is suffering and war .

		We did not quite like , to use a popular phrase , hav - ing an army all dressed up and no place to go .

		But
Germany	LOCATION	committed the ultimate sin she surrendered .

		And art editorial writer of the
New York	LOCATION	Tribune honestly confessed that never again would his morning coffee have quite the savor it had had during the glorious four years of blood-letting .

		The war had ended .

		Everybody knew that .

		It was only
several days later	DATE	that we discovered that Ger - many had not .

		Some 80,000,000 of Germans were still alive ;
Berlin	LOCATION	and
Munich	LOCATION	were still on the map ; the fact of
Germany	LOCATION	as a nation had not been over - come by the signing of the armistice .

		This was really too difficult and embarrassing !

		But if Ger - many had so unkindly robbed us of the opportunity of punishing her by force of arms , we still could punish her in the peace terms .

		The mood of the pre-armistice days inevitably persisted for a con - siderable period .

		If our war problem had been to smash everything German , our peace problem was how to inflict adequate punishment for crimes com - mitted .

		Our newspapers beguiled themselves with theories as to what was to be done to
Germany	LOCATION	, and busy arm-chair diplomatists spent hours carving up the map of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Many newspapers started popular series like '' How Shall the Kaiser Be Pun - ished ? ''

		and telegrams were sent all over 1 the coun - try asking the advice of leading citizens on this grave question of world policy .

		The severity of the armis - tice conditions somewhat relieved the tension .

		There was practically no criticism of these condi - tions , though they frankly shocked all European neutrals , who invariably compared the terms to the peace of Brest-Litovsk .

		American liberals contented themselves with pointing out that the armistice 130 THE DIAL terms were not the peace terms .

		The newspapers as a whole delightedly approved .

		Even the
New York World	ORGANIZATION	, which since has become a fairly liberal paper , wrote on
November 12	DATE	, `` Terms less severe would not have met the situation at all . ''

		This followed the very sensible observation that '' De - mocracy will establish no enduring peace except as it shall be generous and just . ''

		In most places , merely ignorance and malice ; in others , good inten - tions with no realistic criticism of how to make those intentions effective .

		Compare , for instance , the World 's admonition to be generous with an editorial in a Danish paper of the same day : After the capitulation of
Paris	LOCATION	in
1871	DATE	, the victors were at pains immediately !

		to facilitate transport so that the famishing population might be provided with food .

		But the Allies are not following the example of
1871	DATE	.

		On the contrary , the pressure is being intensified by the con - ditions formulated in the armistice .

		Not only is the blockade maintained , but -LCB- simultaneously demands are made for the most important means of transport .

		We venture to hope that
Solf	PERSON	's appeal , which describes the fearful gravity of the situation in simple and dignified words , will create an impression not only in
Washington	LOCATION	but also in
London	LOCATION	and
Paris	LOCATION	.


Germany	LOCATION	is rendered mili - tarily powerless by the other terms of the armistice in such a degree , and the Allies ' victorious position is so completely insured that they might display a chivalrous magnanimity to an enemy in distress .

		But how was ' this condition met by the
Ameri	PERSON	- can press ?

		With the skepticism which a long period of war-time emphasis upon the duplicity of all things German had rendered both unimaginative and un - discriminating .

		The
New York Globe	ORGANIZATION	said suc - cinctly of
Solf	PERSON	's appeal , '' Same Old
Germany	LOCATION	. ''

		The
American Women 's National Committee	ORGANIZATION	said of the pathetic plea of the
National Council	ORGANIZATION	of the Women of
Germany	LOCATION	to Mrs.
Wilson	PERSON	and to
Jane Addams	PERSON	, '' It seems evident that this is just another piece of German trickery . ''

		The
New York World	LOCATION	headed an editorial on the subject : '' i -RRB- Order ; 2 -RRB- Food ; 3 -RRB- Peace . ''

		This , when it is obviously the sensible thing to say that you can not have order without food and peace as precedent conditions .

		Mr.
Hoover	PERSON	had to explain how reluctant he was to give food to
Germany	LOCATION	, while most newspapers assumed an attitude which was not far from what might be summed up in the phrase , '' Let 'em starve . ''

		It was really difficult for most American editors to imagine that even German hunger was anything more than another '' trap . ''

		Begging for food must be either whining or hypocrisy .

		Many newspapers received glowing accounts from their correspondents in the occupied regions of course luncheons , with real meat and butter , at less than
Paris	LOCATION	prices .

		Emphasis was laid upon the extraor - dinary success of the last German harvest .

		Of course editors ` do not take the trouble to read much pf the news , but considering the gravity of the situation it really would seem that they might have informed themselves from undisputed official docu - ments of the frightful malnutrition in many parts of
Germany	LOCATION	and of the shocking statistics of in - crease in the rate of infant mortality and suscep - tibility to infectious diseases , especially tuberculosis .

		And their skepticism came with special bad grace from editors who every other week during the course of the war took pains to write an article showing
Germany	LOCATION	on the verge of collapse through starvation .

		In a word , they were more preoccupied with morale than with facts .

		If
Germany	LOCATION	appeared for a few months to have the military upper hand , then morale was strengthened by pointing out that nobody need be worried because she really could n't go on another month .

		If
Germany	LOCATION	became in a military sense helpless , then the morale necessary for the imposition of harsh terms was strengthened by proving that she was a land flowing with milk and honey , and that therefore there was no need for going easy with her .

		In the case of the food question this technique after a few weeks lost its effectiveness .

		For the shadow of Bolshevism hovered over
Germany	LOCATION	, and the increasing tendency of the revolution towards the Left could only be explained by famine .

		This gradually became the popular view .

		But here again the pre-armistice dogmas which editors of news - papers had done so much to promulgate persisted to embarrass them .

		Until the recent elections in
Germany	LOCATION	, most newspaper editors were torn between their desire to support the
Ebert Government	ORGANIZATION	as the one protection against the Spartacides and their desire to prove that the members of the Ebert Gov - ernment were really all '' the same old gang '' and no more to be trusted than the
Hohenzolierns	PERSON	.

		For the myth that whatever any German did must have behind it some evil ulterior motive had been so drilled into American public opinion that it was difficult to find any reason for sanctioning anybody in
Berlin	LOCATION	.

		There is such a thing as damning too indiscriminately .

		Gradually , however , the mere force of events made the editorial writers abandon the technique of juggling with the food question and haltingly admit that perhaps the
Ebert Govern	LOCATION	- ment might be strengthened by allowing it to pur - chase food .

		This , it was stated , was necessary to protect the German people from the dangerous in - fluence of the fanatic Liebknecht -LRB- the hero of the war , when he served the Allies ' purpose -RRB- , by whom they were being exploited .

		This ironic vacillation was continued until , for a few brief days in Jan - uary , it appeared that the Spartacan revolt might be successful .

		Then opinion became frank and open . ''

		Unless , '' wrote the
New York Globe	ORGANIZATION	on
1919	DATE	THE DIAL
January 9	DATE	, '' the forces of order and democracy in
Germany	LOCATION	are able to re-establish control there is no option but to send forward liberating troops . ''

		The
New York Evening	ORGANIZATION	Sun of earlier date had calmly stated , '' There may remain no choice to the Allies save to pacify the country and turn it over to a sobered and stable popular government inspired by the judgment of the citizens , not by the pas - sions of the mob . ''

		Many newspapers advocated the occupation of all large German cities a bayonet in one hand and a loaf of bread in an - other , as one newspaper explained the method of bringing real democracy to
Germany	LOCATION	.

		The recent exhibition of impatience at the slowness of de - mobilization by the men of all armies has some - what modified the editorial popularity of this view ; it is now hoped that by economic concessions of one sort and another the German revolution can be guided into the safe channels of imitation of Western democracies .

		How , it is now asked , can
Germany	LOCATION	pay indemnities unless she is in position to work off her debt ?

		To make
Germany	LOCATION	strong enough to pay and weak enough not to be a menace that is the paradox which our editors are now trying to resolve after many weeks of attempting to get both contradictory things at the same time .

		How are these aims to be accomplished ?

		Here we touch upon the whole subject of the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	.

		Public opinion is being grad - ually swung around into warm favor of it .

		To be sure , some reactionary and incurably nationalistic papers like the
Chicago	LOCATION	Tribune do not want a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	any more than they want Presi - dent
Wilson	PERSON	's fourteen points to become effective .

		On
January 17	DATE	the Tribune wrote : '' The fourteen points were good fighting points , taking it by and large ; but are they good peace points ?

		Probably not .

		The first one was n't , as we have seen .

		Thirteen remain .

		It 's an unlucky number . ''

		And the next day the same paper referred flippantly to the thirty-eight or more different kinds of
Leagues of Nations	ORGANIZATION	under consideration at
Paris	LOCATION	.

		But jin - goism of this type is exceptional for , after all , most of the heated criticism of the league idea in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	is of the partisan kind .

		Even the
New York Times	ORGANIZATION	, which no one would accuse of radicalism , mildly reproved Marshal Foch for his statement that the Rhine was the '' natural '' defense of
France	LOCATION	, pointing out the best defense of
France	LOCATION	lay in the international guarantees of economic boycott and the like implicit in any effective
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	.

		All liberal papers and those with even a slight liberal bias quite warmly approve the idea : only the ex - tremists at both ends are disgruntled .

		But criticism of what a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	should be like or how it should function , or realistic considerations of the difficulties that stand in the way , are appallingly infrequent .

		For here we touch , I think , one of the fundamental defects of American newspaper edi - torial writing namely , an almost perverse un - willingness or inability -LRB- or both -RRB- to face the facts .

		Not to envisage any other kind of league except that which includes only nations like ourself is an understandable intellectual astigmatism .

		That only '' stable '' democratic governments of our type , based upon the principle that '' the will of the people '' must be expressed by local self-government instead of free association by economic union , are to come in is merely conventional lack of imagination .

		But let me cite three examples from the
New York Globe	ORGANIZATION	, typical of many others in different journals , of downright stupidity .

		In an attempt to exonerate
Italy	LOCATION	from any im - perialistic ambitions the
Globe	ORGANIZATION	, in an editorial dated
January 7 , 1919	DATE	, states inter alia : ''
Italy	LOCATION	has been industriously misrepresented by those who are seek - ing to serve Teutonism and Bolshevism , those twin evils of the world . ''

		But the
Globe	ORGANIZATION	's own corre - spondent in
Paris	LOCATION	, Mr.
John F. Bass	PERSON	, in a dispatch printed on the first page of the
Globe	ORGANIZATION	on
November 23	DATE	, wrote , `` At the present moment the action of one of the powers of the entente -LSB-
Italy	LOCATION	-RSB- is threaten - ing the possible peace of
Europe	LOCATION	. ''

		The dispatch went on to accuse
Italy	LOCATION	of doing a very serious thing breaking the terms of the armistice she had solemnly signed with
Austria	LOCATION	.

		And on
December 1 6 , 1918	DATE	, another dispatch from the same corre - spondent spoke of the disruptive effects of the secret treaties , with especial emphasis on Italian unjust claims .

		Will the editor of the Globe say that his own correspondent is seeking to serve Teutonism and Bolshevism ?

		Or can it-be that he does not read his own newspaper ?

		Or that if he does , he does not understand what words mean ?

		Another ex - ample : on
December 19	DATE
the Globe	ORGANIZATION	had an editorial discussing the Brest-Litovsk treaty in which oc - curred this sentence : '' The world absolves Rou - mania , for she was flat on her back , but
Russia	LOCATION	was not similarly hopeless . ''

		This is such a plain mis - statement of proved fact -LRB- admitted even by those who detest the
Bolsheviki	PERSON	-RRB- that one can only won - der how far ignorance can carry prejudice .

		A final example : in an editorial on
January 2 , 1919	DATE	,
the Globe	ORGANIZATION	tried to prove that
Clemenceau	PERSON	did not urge a `` balance of power '' in the old sense .

		No ; he urged a '' preponderance of power . '' ''

		Balance means a poise .

		Clemenceau through a coalition would have no poise , but overwhelming weight with the democratic nations . ''

		Who could define this as intellectual honesty ?

		132 THE DIAL
February 8	DATE	Yet distortion of the facts or ignorance of them is not confined to the editorial pages .

		It extends to the news columns and even to the headlines , where the caption is often at variance with the sub - sequent text .

		The news from
Russia	LOCATION	furnishes plenty of examples .

		The
New York Times	ORGANIZATION	, for instance , solemnly reprinted
Tchicherin	ORGANIZATION	's note to President
Wilson	PERSON	as a document secretly circulated about the city weeks after it had appeared in the
December	DATE	Liberator , where anyone could have read it for himself .

		So skeptical has the average reader now become that even accredited dispatches are dis - trusted , the popular attitude being , '' Better wait a few days ; they 'll be contradicting it a week from now . ''

		That mysterious creature , the man in the street , is tired of trying to determine how the Soviet Government is collapsing on one day and is a world menace the next ; of reading on the first page of the
New York Times an Associated Press	ORGANIZATION	dispatch inti - mating clearly that one of the reasons the Allies and ourselves had decided to invite the Soviet officials to a meeting was because their strength was too formid - able to be ignored , and then of reading on the edi - torial page of the same paper that the real reason they had been invited was because the Soviet Gov - ernment was going out of existance rapidly ; of being told that Admiral Kolchak and Generals Somanoff and
Horwarth	PERSON	are representatives of democracy ; of learning that
Lenin	PERSON	has been arrested in
Moscow	LOCATION	and has landed in
Spain	LOCATION	on the same day .

		It is held , however , that recently there has been a reaction in the newspaper world towards fairness and liberalism .

		There is a certain amount of justice in the claim .

		Many newspapers have taken up the cudgels for a square deal for
Russia	LOCATION	and for uncensored news from that country .

		Papers like the
Springfield Republican	LOCATION	and the
New York World	LOCATION	have somewhat timidly backed
Wilson	PERSON	in his liberal policies .

		Inevitably , as the pressure of hard facts increases and we emerge from the cloud of war rhetoric into the sharper realities of inter - national trade competition , problems of demobiliza - tion , and labor unrest , many of our newspapers will return to something like common sense .

		But the evidence is all against our Coming out of the war with anything like an enlightened or forceful liberal opinion in our newspapers .

		The effect of the Es - pionage Act has been psychologically disastrous it has caused any real differences of opinion to disap - pear and has made political discussion in a popular sense jejune and tepid .

		Where liberal opinion exists it is spasmodic , half-hearted , and at cross-purposes .

		We have nothing in this country to compare with the two English liberal newspapers , the
Manchester Guardian	ORGANIZATION	and the
London	LOCATION
Daily News	ORGANIZATION	.

		When the most momentous decisions of history are being made , we are left without any liberal newspaper guidance .

		The record of American newspaper opinion since the armistice raises again the disturbing question of what is the function of the press in a democracy .

		Where local affairs of immediate interest are con - cerned the press is subject to a constant corrective .

		People find out the facts for themselves and can not be long imposed upon .

		But in foreign affairs where ignorance and apathy are the rule for the great mass of people , the power of the press is practically om - nipotent .

		It is almost as great as that of the Church in the old days and certainly greater than the power , of the
State	ORGANIZATION	itself today indeed , the governing power of the
State	ORGANIZATION	is the creature of that mightier power of publicity .

		Nor does this power of publicity reside chiefly or even to a small degree in the edi - torial '' guidance '' given its readers by the daily press ; it lies rather in the direction and color given to opinions by its entire treatment of the news , by what it leaves out as fully as what it prints .

		The question of the relation of the press to govern - mental propaganda in time of war especially in a democracy has been raised sharply for
America	LOCATION	in the last fourteen months .

		In a country as large as our own a rumor can be started and never caught up with by the belated denials .

		Most of our larger cities west of the Alleghenies have but one or two morning newspapers compared with the many party organs of a simpler and less highly cen - tralized day .

		The independent local editor has been replaced by a small business man who makes use of syndicated material and '' boiler-plate '' edi - torials and cartoons prepared at some central office .

		The great news-gathering agencies , without which any newspaper is merely a local or trade affair , can be counted on the fingers of one hand and are sub - ject to internal limitations .

		The power of censor - ship over news and the readiness of the public to swallow all sorts of lies about foreign affairs have revealed a weapon which is too good for the finan - cial and interested parties to miss .

		In
England	LOCATION	careful observers declare that the Government itself is but the whim of the '' stunt '' press .

		In
America	LOCATION	that result seems more remote , although after our recent experience with our newspapers it must be reckoned a danger .

		A little more accentuation of the present tendency towards consolidation , and the press can easily dictate the kinds of national cam - paigns which must succeed .

		That this is a mockery of what we mean by democracy goes without saying .

		Without free opinion and free expression of that opinion , without a minority opposition which com - mands respect , so-called self-government is a failure .

		HAROLD STEARNS .

		1919 THE DIAL The Laughter of Detachment k N OBJECT of humor must be both of us and apart from us .

		A meteor , for instance , is too remote from our life to be a matter of jest ; on the other hand , our mother is too near to us .

		But a mud pie or a mother-in-law combine the alien and familiar in the piquant proportions to be traditionally humorous .

		I dislike lugging in serious philosophers to testify in so pleasant a matter as humor , but I suppose I owe it to
Bergson	PERSON	to say that he explains that human things are laughable in exact proportion as they are machinelike , that is , alien .

		This recipe for humor is obviously easier to understand than to carry out , for a multitude of conditions and forces conspire to prevent us from withdrawing sufficiently from life to afford us even a wan smile .

		Of course , it is easy in our human relations to laugh at a stranger .

		Our primitive blood-lust takes care of that ; indeed it is difficult to refrain .

		It is likewise easy to become amused at alien peoples , providing their civilization is sufficiently below or above our own to afford little in common .

		We smirk at the Hindu , and the Eskimo undoubtedly smirks back at us .

		This sort of fun-making at the foreigner , which concentrates on his unfamiliar habits and relies on the minimum of similarity running through all mankind to keep the raillery at a smiling point , is only one step above plain belligerency .

		One word too much and the , smile is a snarl .

		There is that famous occasion when
Mark Twain	PERSON	directed
Paul Bourget	PERSON	's atten - tion to the efforts Americans make to find out who their grandfathers were , and Frenchmen their fathers .

		Bourget got all heated up over it .

		We can also laugh with considerable ease at the things at home which we dislike , for our antagon - ism , if not too intense , furnishes the necessary alien - ation .

		In fact our laughter , in this case , indicates our hatred and our impotence to remove the object of it through direct action .

		This is often the ter - rible laughter of Swift and Juvenal .

		Thoughtful men admire the courage and judgment required to condemn an age ; perhaps they regret the weakness this laughter betrays .

		Often , indeed , their hatred pushes its theme so far from their sympathies that the note of pure belligerency hardly fails to domi - nate ; and we write them down for satirists .

		Their phrases are a jester 's bauble to begin with , and in the end a naked sword .

		The satirist occasionally fools us in our bent toward mocking strangers by throwing a mask of unfamiliarity over contemporary life .

		So Gulliver goes traveling in foreign climes , and
Montesquieu	LOCATION	writes letters from
Persia	LOCATION	.

		How - ever , the satirist is never fully honest ; he always makes a partial reservation in favor of himself .

		He can laugh a world to scorn , but he somehow leaves the impression that he fortunately does n't belong to that world .

		The rub comes when we attempt a withdrawal from our own life and our own interests .

		In addition to the pressure of the age , the trampling forces of the herd , entrenched conventions and tra - ditions , barrage fires of invested privilege , we meet the supreme enemy in our own ego .

		There is * a , dignity in mocking the universe Satan found it .

		There is exaltation in a magnificent and inclusive opposition ; we equate the cosmos with ourself by the apposition .

		But to expose our own little person to the pitiless bolts of humor demands a rare soul .

		Yet only through this exposure of self does the humor we cast upon the rest of the world become noble and regenerative .

		There is necessary the courage of heroes and the humility of saints and something more , for heroes and saints are not notori - ously humorous .

		Even in their sacrifices lingers a residue of reserve , a prejudice for their own cause .

		I can perhaps make clear the extraordinary de - tachment of the humorist by saying that he attains a cosmic point of view .

		From the promontory of a fixed star he observes our world and his own ridicu - lously obscure place in the poor stream of humanity , while the bond of sjanpathy necessary for humorous expression becomes as tenuous as ether and yet as universal as space .

		In these moments the humorist shares with the philosopher that primary wonder which is the mother of speculation .

		This philosophic wonder , as
Schopenhauer	PERSON	phrases it , '' becomes a sad astonishment , and , like the overture to
Don Giovanni	PERSON	, philosophy , '' together with cosmic humor , '' begins with a minor chord . ''

		Adversity and disillusionment are the classic guides to this lone observatory where the real wonderland is situate , and ` it is their com - panionship which gives our great humorists an un - relinquishable sadness , and which seasons their laughter with the salt of tears .

		This cosmic watchtower is never far away ; at any moment one may stumble upon it .

		Okakura Kakuza assures us it can be reached in the cult of Tea which '' is the noble secret of laughing at yourself , calmly yet thoroughly , and is thus humor itself the smile of philosophy . ''

		There you can '' dream of evanes - THE DIAL February 8 ence and linger in the beautiful foolishness of things . ''

		There is no reason for presuming that
Mark Twain	PERSON	frequented this ghostly station on the peak of the universe more often than any other humoristic specu - lator indeed , I have a suspicion Rabelais built him - self an inn on the very crest , near the spot where Aristophanes used to shy pebbles at
Olympus	ORGANIZATION	but no other has left us such wealth of biographic detail in the way of reminiscence , chronicles , and letters to indicate these excursions in disillusionment .

		His Letters , arranged by
Albert Bigelow Paine	PERSON	-LRB- 2 vols. ,
Harper	PERSON	;
$ 4	MONEY	-RRB- , particularly reveal him in his freest speculative mood , and because this mood is the Parnassus of his merry brotherhood , the present two ' volumes hold an assured place on the uncertain border between literature and philosophy .

		Again ,
Mark Twain	PERSON	was happy in the possession of friends who invited freedom of expression :
Howells	PERSON	, who is an old lounger-about at that cosmic rendezvous ; ''
Joe '' Twitchell	PERSON	, no slouch himself at mountain - eering in those laughter-swept heights ; and a host of free men whom
Twain	PERSON	met during seventy-five years of pilgrimaging in a world of Innocents .

		I began to reread the letters for quotation at this point , but , when I had earmarked forty in less than as many minutes , I saw that the best thing to do was to tell anyone interested to go through the two volumes himself .

		He will learn what Howells meant by the '' bottom of fury '' existing in Mark 's fun and what I mean exists in all great fun when he reads , as
Howells	PERSON	once did : I have been reading the morning paper .

		I do it every morning well knowing that I shall find in it the usual depravities and basenesses and hypocrisies and cruelties that make up civilization , and cause me to put in the rest of the day pleading for the damnation of the hum ^ n race .

		I can not seem to get my prayers answered , yet I do not despair .

		As an example of this sort of civilization , the Boer War was of course '' nuts '' for the author of
Tom Sawyer	PERSON	.

		We need his lightnings today .

		Privately speaking , this is a sordid and criminal war , and in every way shameful and excuseless .

		Every day I write -LRB- in my head -RRB- bitter magazine articles about it , but I have to stop with that .

		For
England	LOCATION	must not fall ; it would mean an inundation of Russian and German political degradations which would envelop the globe .

		... Even wrong and she is wrong
England	LOCATION	must be upheld .

		Why < was the human race created ?

		Or at least why was n't something creditable created in place of it ?

		God had his opportunity .

		He could have made a reputation .

		But no , He must commit this grotesque folly a lark which must have cost him a regret or two when He came to think it over and observe effects ... It was my intention to make some disparaging remarks about the human race ; and so I kept this letter open for that purpose ... but I can do better for I can snip out of the
Times	ORGANIZATION	various samples and side-lights which bring the race down to date , and expose it as of yester - day .

		If you will notice , there is seldom a telegram in a paper which fails to show up one or more members and beneficiaries of our Civilization as promenading in his shirt-tail , with the rest of his regalia in the wash .

		I love to see the holy ones air their smug pieties and admire them and smirk over them , and at the same mo - ment frankly and publicly show their contempt for the pieties of the Boer confidently expecting the approval of the country and the pulpit , and getting it .

		I notice that God is on both sides in this war ; thus history repeats itself .

		But I am the only person who has noticed this ; everybody here thinks He is playing the game for this side , and for this side only .

		This could be the scolding of a satirist if there were not behind it the cosmic view that lumped mankind with himself : Am I finding fault with you and the rest of the popu - lace 1 ?

		No I assure you I am not .

		For I know the human race 's limitations , and this makes it my pleasant duty to be fair to it .

		Each person in it is honest in one or several ways , but no member of it is honest in all the ways required by by what ?

		By his own standard .

		Outside of that , as I look at it , there .

		is no obligation upon him .

		Am I honest ?

		I give you my word of honor -LRB- private -RRB- I am not ... Yes , even I am dishonest .

		Not in many ways , but in some .

		Forty-one , I think it is .

		We are certainly all honest in one or several ways every man in the world though I have reason to think I am the only one whose black-list runs so light .

		Sometimes I feel lonely enough in this lofty solitude .

		To command these impersonal vistas requires a certain innocence of heart that we associate with adolescence , when the world first reveals itself to the heart of the child .

		Mrs.
Clemens	PERSON	always called her husband '' Youth . ''

		Time and again he saw himself as though for the first time with gaping , chuckling wonder .

		And simultaneously he would boast and mock .

		He once concluded a ten paragraph sketch of his life with the gay confession , '' I have been an author for twenty years and an ass for fifty-five . ''

		This is no more the disillusionment of age than the following , written in the flush of twenty-eight , is the callow cynicism of youth : '' If I were not naturally a lazy idle good-for-nothing vaga - bond , I could make it -LSB- journalism -RSB- pay me
$ 20,000	MONEY	a year .

		But I do n't suppose I shall ever be any account .

		I lead an easy life , though ... and I am proud to say I - am the most conceited ass in the Territory . ''

		Both are quick and keen glances at himself from the top of the universe .

		The final detachment comes when we separate ourself not only from mankind and from our own person but from the tyranny of time .

		This measures the height of our withdrawal as plainly as the snow line on a mountain .

		Our detachment from time , however , is never complete ; here our sympathies are hardest to subdue , and often the mere consciousness of the tragedy of years is as near as we can come to freedom from it .

		Under the date of
January 22 , 1898	DATE	,
Twain	PERSON	writes :
1919	DATE	THE DIAL Dear Howells : Look at these ghastly figures .

		I used to write it ``
Hartford	LOCATION	,
1871	DATE	'' ... and how much lies between ... you speak of the glorious days of that old time and they were .

		Ifs my quarrel that traps like these are set .

		Perhaps the gist of the humor , pathos , and pene - trating vision of cosmic detachment are concentrated in the lines he once wrote '' Joe ''
Twitchell	PERSON	: Well , we are all getting along here first-rate ; Livy gains strength daily , and sits up a deal ; the baby is five weeks old and but no more ` of this ; somebody may be reading this letter 80 years hence .

		And so , my friend -LRB- you pitying snob , I mean , who are holding this yellow paper in your hand in

		No , I keep my news ; you keep your compassion .

		Suffice it you to know , scoffer and ribald , that the little child is old and blind , now , and once more toothless ; and the rest of us are shadows , these many , many years .

		Yes , and your time cometh !

MARVIN M. LOWENTHAL	PERSON	.

		Remaking the Past HAVE BEEN taught that the past is gone be - yond recall and that the future is ours to command .

		But this is one of the bundle of untruths that con - stitutes the moral instruction of youth .

		We have learned , all too painfully , that nerve cell , environ - ment , and the cumulative sweep of change are mak - ing a rigid future which we can neither determine nor anticipate ; that '' what is to be will be . ''

		It is the past which is ours .

		Memory is short and un - certain , records are voluminous and fragmentary , and we can make of what is gone very much what we like .

		Evidently it will not do for each one of us to create for himself our national past .

		So very re - luctantly we entrust that work to the historians .

		They still talk as if the past were the result of the skill and cunning of
Franklin	LOCATION	,
Lincoln	LOCATION	,
Hanna	LOCATION	, and
James J. Hill	PERSON	, and without doubt such '' historical '' persons had something to do with it .

		But the past which lives in our minds and animates our conduct is much more the result of the craft of
Fiske	PERSON	,
Osgood	PERSON	,
Rhodes	LOCATION	, and Becker , and even more the compiler of the school history .

		If the historians give us the truth , we accept the labors of their minds and thumbs .

		If they give us a story we do not like , or can not understand , or one that is untrue , others can be found who will say truthful and acceptable things .

		Of course there is a minimum of issue , in - cident , character , and event , which the most obliging maker of the past can not avoid .

		But this gives zest to his game rather than restricts his art .

		Within the limits the stores are ample and varied enough for the purpose .

		An issue can be variously formulated ; the meaning of an incident can not be exhausted ; the fulness of personality can not be absorbed by a pen-picture ; and the actuality of an event ramifies unto the ends of the earth .

		The historian must not be denied his right to select , to infer , to assemble , to interpret .

		He must be allowed to satisfy his sense of proportion , of unity , of relation .

		He is obliged to write in terms that his readers can under - stand .

		Thus there is no sense of artifice in his ef - forts .

		Unconsciously he mistakes creation for ex - position and knows not himself as the maker of the past .

		Of the process of supplying the nation with a comfortable past there can be no end .

		The creations of an earlier period have been replaced by the '' scientific '' histories of yesterday .

		The past which they have made for us is on the whole quite satisfy - ing to the great democracy .

		The .

		shorter works , which are read , tell how consciously the men of old labored together in order that just such a society as we have now might exist .

		The larger ones , which are not , in their many volumes present mute testi - mony to the stupendous greatness of our past .

		But a small class of intellectuals , not at all representative of the healthy-minded nation , and rather fussy about things which they call '' truth '' and '' reality , '' dis - like this .

		They demand a past created in the intel - lectual likeness of themselves .

		They insist that histories glorify rather than narrate ; that they select their materials by canons of social respectability ; that they neglect matters of significance of which only inferential evidence lies in the documents ; that they try to picture the whole by getting together a mass of unrelated details ; and that the artificial characters which run across their pages are animated by motives which are a combination of the spirit of
Regulus	ORGANIZATION	and
Paul	PERSON	's advice to the
Corinthians	LOCATION	.

		They insist that those who profess to be writing history based upon '' the facts '' and '' free from any philosophical bias whatever '' are merely deluding themselves into doing uncritical work .

		They insist that there can be no '' scientific '' history without cognizance of what the humanistic sciences have to teach of human motives and conduct .

		They demand a history conscious of its problems , and one whose assumptions square with the latest conclusions of psychology , economics , and sociology .

		They demand a past that is true and intelligible to people who babble about '' economic determinism , '' '' pragma - 136 THE DIAL February 8 tisra , '' `` human behavior , '' and `` social guidance . ''

England	LOCATION	, by

Chron	ORGANIZATION	- icles of
America Series Yale University	ORGANIZATION	.

		Press ;
$ 3.50	MONEY	-RRB- is to be commended .

		Its appeal is alike in theme and authorship .

		Few episodes can vie with the breach with
England	LOCATION	in tempting the latter - day historian .

		It is a convenient thread whereon to hang a theory that attempts to fathom the mystery of human conduct .

		It offers a practical test of the influence of the economic motive in history .

		It gives a chance to see Americans of another age else - where than on dress parade .

		It shows something of the way in which incidents somehow get tied to - gether into what later is mistaken for a historical sequence .

		The name of the author is equally invit - ing .

		It is guarantee of a sprightly style , happy phrasing , and a disproof of
Thoreau	PERSON	's dictum , '' The sun never shines in history . ''

		Even better , no his - torian of the present day knows more clearly what he is about , is more sensitive to the nature of his materials , or is more artful in their use .

		The book is a type of a new class of historical works which bids fair to become increasingly numerous and popular .

		In form the book is a simple , straightforward narrative with never a word about '' motives '' or '' conduct '' or `` causation . ''

		Like a good workman the author keeps his craft knowledge to himself or expounds it elsewhere .

		He presents a rapidly mov - ing and entertaining volume of incident , quotation , and comment . '

		This runs from
1757	DATE	, when
Frank	PERSON	- lin was '' ordered home '' to
England	LOCATION	, to the Dec - laration of Independence in
1776	DATE	.

		He attempts '' to convey to the reader , not a record of what men did , but a sense of how they thought and felt about what they did . ''

		The thread about which doings and thought and feelings move is the conventional one of stamp tax , protest , and repeal ; of customs duties , non-importation , and tax on tea ; of the rights of colonists , of Englishmen in
America	LOCATION	, and of men ; and of the other matters indigenous to the sequel .

		The narrative quality is so well sustained that even amid disputation and polemic the reader would ac - count the story only an interesting episode well told , were it not for the author 's reference to it in his preface as '' an enterprise of questionable ortho - doxy . ''

		Perhaps this confession of heresy is a mere device for tempting the reader .

		None the less it raises the question of the element of novelty in the past as Mr.
Becker	PERSON	fabricates it .

		It is not to be found in the sequence of incident , in the event , in the backbone of the story .

		It lies rather in a creative or , if you will , a selective touch deftly applied to issue , inci - dent , and character .

		Note the setting for the ac - tion .

		To the dignitaries of an imperial British government '' colonial rights '' are incidental to a schedule in a tax bill .

		But American aristocrats '' clothed themselves '' in '' the homespun garb , half Roman and half Puritan , of a virtuous republican - ism , '' and '' stamped small matters '' with '' great character . ''

		Or observe how Mr.
Becker	PERSON	shapes the issues .

		He quotes from
George Seville	PERSON	, '' Our trade is hurt ; what the devil have you been doing ?

		For our part we do n't pretend to understand your politics and American matters , but our trade is hurt ; pray remedy it , and a plague on you if you wo n't . ''

		He observes that a pamphlet of '' twenty-three small pages , '' written by Mr.
Soame Jenyns	PERSON	, in answer to the arguments of the colonists , was '' highly satis - factory to himself and doubtless to the average read - ing Briton who understood constitutional matters best when they were humorously expounded in pamphlets that could be had for sixpence . ''

		He shows how
Hutchinson	PERSON	, and for that matter many another pamphleteer , loyal or liberal , arrived at con - clusions which were identical with his assumptions , but none the less satisfying for all of that .

		And he points out how repeatedly during the quarrel the colonists pronounced themselves '' humble and loyal subjects , '' '' dutiful children , '' '' yielding in loyalty to none . ''

		The author 's creative touch is even more in evi - dence in portraying the men who took part in the incidents .

		He pictures the industrious
Ben Frank	PERSON	- lin , '' Friend of the Human Race , '' charged with an important mission to
England	LOCATION	and yet spending two months '' more uselessly than ever he could remem - ber '' in deciding what boat to take .

		He implies that the Sage 's return from the mother country , postponed month by month until five years had rolled around , was delayed largely by his overfond - ness for '' interesting and agreeable conversation . ''

		Grenville is to him '' a dry , precise man ... al - most always right in little matters . ''


John Adams	PERSON	, a rising young lawyer , who was '' just on the point of making a reputation and winning a competence , '' when trouble over the stamp act led to the closing of the courts , insisted that '' This execrable project was set on foot for my ruin as well as that of Amer - ica in general . ''

		His description of
Samuel Adams	PERSON	, the personal ingredient most essential to the Revolu - tion , indicates ' where the sources of great events sometimes lie .


S. Adams	PERSON	was '' a poor provider . '' ''

		For business '' he '' was without any aptitude whatever , being entirely devoid of the acquisitive instinct , and neither possessing nor ever being able I
1919	DATE	THE DIAL to acquire any skill in the fine art of inducing people to give for things more than it cost to make them . ''

		He was a well-known member of the ''
Caucus Club	ORGANIZATION	, '' founded in the likeness of the ''
Caulkers Club	ORGANIZATION	'' of his father 's day , which had existed for .

		the purpose of laying '' plans for introducing certain persons into places of trust and power . ''

		The Copley portrait might be supplemented by another representing him '' placed in
Tom Dawes	PERSON	's garret , dimly seen through tobacco smoke , sitting , with coat off , drinking flip , in the midst of
Uncle Fairfield	LOCATION	, Story ,
Cooper	PERSON	, and a rudis indigestaque moles '' the while he devised schemes for making '' Brutuses of the men of
Boston	LOCATION	. ''

		Beneath this easy narrative the stuff of which Mr.
Becker	PERSON	remakes the past displays itself .

		It con - sists of act , thought , and feeling , in every tem - poral sequence in which the three can be arranged .

		The incident to the British ministerial mind was a mighty matter when eyed by the colonial aristocrat .

		The issue which separated residents of the mother country and colonists and rent each into parties and factions was an ever changing one .

		As the matter in dispute came to be newly formulated , colonists shifted from one to the other side of the argument ; those who quarreled with
England	LOCATION	meant by opposi - tion everything from submissive protest to open de - fiance ; and many , too , even unto the last , remained in a '' neither-nor '' attitude .

		The incidents of the story , rather than the outcome , concerned most the actors .

		Together they lack much of being a record of a human purpose moving relentlessly to its con - summation .

		The actors are men of capacity and frailty .

		They respond to that within which makes one man different from another .

		They vary in sen - sitiveness to conventions of thought and conduct , to the sense of duty , and to their own material in - terests .

		They are wise and stupid , capable of under - standing others and too obstinate to try , prone alike to tolerance and jealousy .

		They are given to im - petuous action which they can afterwards defend as an expression of a well-thought-out purpose .

		They can selfishly respond to their own material interests and without manifest dishonesty vindicate their actions on high moral grounds .

		Their feeling that they were actors in a great drama came rather from a sense of their own importance than from a clear appreciation of the event which emerged from their activities .

		The independence which came to them was a by-product of much concern with immediate things .

		It clothes polemic and shaken fist with ex post facto values alien alike to the man and the occa - sion .

		It is the stuff of which Mr.
Becker	PERSON	makes the past that one must take into account who would appraise his volume .

		In the matter of assessing values the issue is clear .

		The honesty , workman - ship , and artistry of the author are beyond ques - tion .

		There is no quarrel over '' facts . ''

		He has as many as he needs ; his picture would be spoiled by many more .

		He might insist as truthfully as the '' scientific '' historians that his art is that of per - sonal restraint , and that he '' has allowed the facts to tell their own story . ''

		But he knows as well as the critic that the facts tell different stories for dif - ferent men .

		Something back of them is to be called up for judgment , a something that we may call '' a conception of history . ''

		A judgment upon his work is a judgment upon a new adventure in history writing .

		Manifestly the verdict will depend upon who makes it .

		Fortunately there are many historians and there is no reason why anyone should not have the past of
America	LOCATION	arranged according to his liking .

		There are the successors of Bancroft who see '' the hand of God '' guiding national development to ks consummation in the glorious present .

		There is
McMaster	PERSON	with his curious mosaic that contains everything about the development of '' the people '' save the few things one wants to know .

		There is Channing with a collection of material far too large and miscellaneous to be turned into a past , but ' which none the less he persists in using .

		There is
Hart	PERSON	, weighing and assessing men and events by canons juggled out of a provincial conscience as if they werq : the cosmic verities themselves , and being '' scientific '' all the while .

		And there is Beard re - cording a clear-cut struggle between opposing eco - nomic groups , with property in the offing imparting values to events .

		As against these , and many others , the '' new history , '' of which Mr.
Becker	PERSON	's book is so valuable a type , will find readers .

		It will appeal to those who have acquired '' modern notions '' of human motives and conduct and what is meant by cause in history .

		They are likely to call his entertaining little volume , which contains statements that are not recorded in any document , '' realism , '' the whil they hurl the charge of `` romanticism '' against the several tome atomic histories of the `` scientific school . ''

		Books like his are filled with issues , inci - dents , and persons whom they can understand .

		And if at times they can not escape the feeling that the author in his detachment is saying , '' Interesting antics , these of the humans ; watch them , '' they can forgive him for not furnishing a new refuge to the homeless economic man .

		But they can not escape the conviction that there is quite a bit of Mr.
Becker	PERSON	in the episode of the past which he has remade .


WALTON H. HAMILTON	PERSON	.

		i 3 8 THE DIAL
February 8	DATE	Pelleas et Melisande `` EBUSSY 'S music is our own .

		All forms lie dor - mant in the soul , and there is no work of art actually foreign to us , nor can such a one appear , in all the future ages of the world .

		But the music of De - bussy is proper to us in our day as is no other .

		For it moved .

		in us before its birth , and afterward re - turned upon us like a release .

		Even at a first en - counter the style of Pelleas was mysteriously fa - miliar .

		All its novelty was but the sudden con - sciousness that we had always needed , say , such a rhythm , such a luminous chord , perhaps had even heard them faintly sounding in our imaginations .

		The music seemed old as our separate existences .

		It seemed an exquisite recognition of certain intense and troubling and appeasing moments .

		It seemed fashioned out of certain ineluctable moments that had budded out of our lives , ineffably sad and sweet , and had made us new , and set us apart .

		And , at the music 's breath , at a half-whispered note , at the un - closing of a rhythm , the flowering of a cluster of tones out of the warm still darkness , they were arisen again in the fullness of their stature , and were become ours entirely .

		For the music of
Debussy	ORGANIZATION	is proper to an im - pressionistically feeling age .

		Structurally it is a fabric of exquisite and poignant moments , each one of them full and complete in itself .

		The phrases contribute to the whole , compose a richly , clearly organized mass , and yet are independent , and sig - nificant in themselves .

		No chord , no phrase is sub - ordinate .

		Each one exists for the sake of its own beauty , occupies the universe for an instant , then merges and disappears .

		The harmonies are not , as in other music , preparations .

		They are apparently an end in themselves , flow in space and then change as a shimmering stuff changes hue .

		For all its golden earthiness , the style of
Debussy	ORGANIZATION	is the most liquid and impalpable of musical styles .

		It is for - ever gliding , gleaming , melting , crystallizing for an instant in some savory phrase , then moving quiver - ingly onward .

		It is well-nigh edgeless .

		It seems to flow through our perceptions as water flows through fingers , and the iridescent bubbles that float upon it burst if we but touch them .

		It is forever suggesting water fountains and pools and glisten - ing sprays and the heaving bosom of the sea or the formless breath of the breeze and storms and per - fumes , or the play of sunshine and moonlight .

		At the bidding of Debussy the sound of the piano , usually but the ringing of flat-colored stones , be - comes rich and dense , seems to take on the prop - erties of satins and velvets and aromatic wines .

		At each new employment the pedal seems to wash a new tint over the keyboard .

		The orchestration of Debussy infallibly produces all that is cloudy and diaphanous in ea.ch instrument .

		There is no other style that could have transmitted so faithfully the essential qualities of that most glimmering , floating of poems ,
L'Apres-midi d'un Faune	ORGANIZATION	.

		The fruity climbing of the chromatic flute , the drowsy pizzicati of the strings , the languorous sighing of the horn have caught , quite as magically as
Mallarme	ORGANIZATION	's verses , the atmosphere of the daydream , the sleepy warmth of the sunshot grass , and the white wonder of arms and breasts and thighs .

		And yet , the music of
Debussy	ORGANIZATION	is classically pre - cise and firm and knit .

		There is neither uncertainty nor mistiness in his form .

		His lyrical , shimmering structures are logically irrefragible .

		The line never hesitates , never becomes involved nor lost .

		It pro- ceeds directly , clearly , and passing through jewels and colors fuses them into a single mass .

		The music plots its curve sheerly , is always full of its own weight and timbre .

		It can be said , quite without exaggeration , that his best work omits nothing , neg - lects nothing , and that every component element has been justly treated .

		His little pieces occupy a space as completely as the most massive and im - passioned of compositions .

		It is just because of their formal purity that they succeeded in imparting the sensations intended in them .

		In the hands of others , in the hands of so many of
Debussy	ORGANIZATION	's imitators , his style becomes confused and soft and unsubstantial .

		For the fluidity and the restlessness dominate them , whereas in Debussy these qualities are controlled by an indomitable love of clarity and concentration .

		For he is of the race of Moliere and
Pascal	PERSON	and
Verlaine	PERSON	.

		He is of the classical French traditions in his intolerance of all that is vague and murky and pointless , in his instinctive preference for what is aristocratically temperate and firm and reason - able .

		Despite the modern complexity of his spirit , his latter-day subtlety and delicacy and weariness , his mundane grace and finesse , he is neither spiritually soft nor uncertain .

		From the very commencement of his career he was nicely conscious of himself .

		Few musicians have been more sensible of their gift , bet - ter aware of its quality and limitations .

		He had a
1919	DATE	THE DIAL sureness of taste , a sense of fitness and values , that was rare and singular .

		It is just the superposition upon a subtle and sensuous nature of so classical a tendency that gives his music its character .

		For he could fix precisely the most elusive emotions , emo - tions that flow on the borders of consciousness , vaguely , and that most of us can not grasp for very dizziness .

		For him the shadowy places of the soul were full of light .

		There are moments when this work , the fine fluid line of sound , the phrases that merge and pass and vanish into one another , become the gleaming rims that circumscribe vast darkling forms .

		For , not in - frequently ,
Debussy	ORGANIZATION	captured what is distinguished in the age 's delight and tragedy .

		All its fine sensu - ality , its
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	pleasure in the infinite daintiness and warmth of nature , all its sudden joyous dis - covery of color and touch that made men feel as though neither had been known before , are con - tained in this music .

		Debussy 's art , too , is full of images of the `` earth of the liquid and slumbering trees , '' the `` earth of departed sunset , '' the `` earth of the vitreous pour of the full moon just tinged with blue . ''

		It is full of material loveliness , plies itself to its innumerable forms to the somnolence of the
Southern	LOCATION
night	TIME	, to the hieratic gestures of temple-dancers , to the fall of lamplight into the dark , the fantastic gush of fireworks , the romance of old mirrors and faded brocades and
Saxony	LOCATION	clocks , to the green young panoply of
spring	DATE	.

		And , just as it gives again the age 's consciousness of the delicious shell of earth , so too it gives its sense of weariness and oppression and powerlessness .

		The century had been loud with blare and rumors and the vibration of movement , and man had apparently traversed vast distances , and explored titanic heights and abysmal depths .

		And yet , for all the glare , the earth was dark , darker perhaps because of the miasmic light , and the life of man seemed as ever a brief and sad and simple thing , the stretching of impotent hands , unable to grasp and hold ; the in - terlacing of shadows ; the unclosing , a moment be - fore nightfall , of exquisite and fragile blossoms .

		And this sense of the infirmity of life , the conscious - ness that it had no more than the significance of a dream with passing lights , or halting steps in the snow , or an old and half-forgotten story , had mixed a deep wistfulness and melancholy into the very glamour of the world , and had itself become heavier for all the loveliness .

		And both sentiments , the delicious and the oppressive , are caught in this music .

		If at times
Debussy	ORGANIZATION	is so great a poet , it is because of his rare sensibility .

		Few musicians have felt with a greater tenderness , a greater poignancy .

		So de - cisively did the particular sentiments of his time obtain over
Debussy	LOCATION	, so fully did his music grow out of them , that he appears to stand in almost symboli - cal relationship to his day .

		In a fashion he is the artist most typical of it .

		He is amongst us fully .

		He is here in our midst , in the world of the city .

		We seem to know him as we know ourselves .

		He seems to live our manner of life , and there is no experi - ence of his that is not , intensified perhaps by his poet 's gift , our own , or that can not possibly become ours .

		He seems almost ourselves as he passes through the city 's twilight , intent upon some errand which we too have gone , journeying a road which we our - selves have traveled .

		We know the room in which he lives , the moments that come upon him there in the silence of the lamp .

		For he has found there quintessence .

		Few musicians have been so persever - ingly essential , have managed to maintain their emotion at a height so steadily .

		Perhaps
Bach	PERSON	and
Moussorgsky	ORGANIZATION	alone have found phrases as pithy and inclusive as those with which Pelleas is strewn , phrases that in a few simple notes epitomize profound and fine emotions .

		There are moments in the work of
Debussy	ORGANIZATION	in which each note opens a prospect .

		There are portions of Pelleas that are like those moments of human intercourse in which a single word unseals deep reservoirs .

		In - deed the most impassioned utterances of the drama ,
Melisande	ORGANIZATION	's half whispered `` Pelleas !

		Pelleas ! ''

		in the turret scene , and the almost toneless avowal of love in the last scene by the fountain , nearly approach that silence which is the largest form of speech .

		And though the work is to a degree apart from all his others , ajid is indeed the ultimate flowering of his art , none of the remainder of his compositions , not even the slightest , is unworthy of it and devoid entirely of its fine poesy .

		He never doffs his singing - robes .

		His work is always the expression of pure and clear , often intense and incandescent , feeling .

		He always was aware of beauty , always revealed it .

		He never wrote ugly or dull or insignificant tones .

		In his brain , the thick-lipped sentiment of the coon-song , even , gets a delicacy , a humorous tenderness .

		A thing as trifling as the little waltz Le Plus Que Lent has a lissome grace and sweetness .

		Perhaps his music wants the exalted and majestic mystical tone of certain other music .

		Nevertheless it has a lumi - nous tenderness that is scarcely to be duplicated in musical art , perhaps only in the work of so rare and solitary a figure as
Josquin	PERSON	.

		And tenderness , after 140 THE DIAL
February 8	DATE	all , is the most intense of all emotions .

		A complex of determinants made of Pelleas et Melisande the most eloquent of all
Debussy	ORGANIZATION	's works , and his eternal sign .

		Issuing as he did from the classical French tradition , abhorring overemphasis and speciousness and exaggeration , want of taste and lucidity , it was ordained that Debussy should turn upon the excesses of the Wagnerian music-drama and , fortified by the knowledge of
Rameau	ORGANIZATION	's works , oppose his proper standards .

		His own deep sense of the French term and the possibility of its treat - ment in dramatic recitative almost compelled his re - volt to assume the form of an opera .


Maeterlinck	PERSON	's little play afforded him his opportunity , offered it - self as a unique auxiliary .

		In itself it is by no means an insignificant piece of expression .

		It has the pro- portions , the accent , of the time .

		It too is full of a constant and overwhelming sense of the evanescence and flux of things , and establishes a thing by fixing its atmosphere .

		And this `` vieille et triste legende de la foret '' is filled with images the old and somber castle , inhabited by aging people , lying lost amid melancholy land and sunless forests ; the rose that blooms in the shadow underneath
Melisande	LOCATION	's casement ; Melisande 's hair that falls farther than her arms can reach that called a vital and profound response from
Debussy	ORGANIZATION	's imagination .

		But it was the figure of Melisande herself that ulti - mately made him pour himself into the play , and intensify it into the perfect and poignant thing it is .

		This shadowy little drama permitted
Debussy	ORGANIZATION	to give himself in the creation of his ideal image .

		It is Melisande that the music reveals from the moment that she rises from along the rocks in the mystery of her golden hair , perhaps from the very moment that the orchestra begins the work .

		The entire score is but what a man might feel towards a woman , a woman that was his , and yet was strange and mys - terious and unknown to him .

		There are moments when it is all that lies between two people , when it is the fullness of their knowledge .

		It is the per - fect sign and symbol of an experience .

		For this is what we ourselves have lived .

		Debussy 's art could have no second climax .

		For it is a unit .

		His task was the establishment of a style .

		It was for that that he came into the world .

		It was in the order of things that , once his genius having assumed its definite form and received its definitive expression , the remainder of his music should be comparatively less important .

		It is not that the two series of Images for piano , or some of the later orchestral poems , or the music to Le Mar - tyre de
Saint Sebastian	PERSON	, are not perfect and astound - ing pieces of work , and do not contain some of his loveliest ideas .

		It is only that they are the applica - tions to the medium of the piano and the orchestra of a style already achieved in
Pelleas	LOCATION	.

		There is not the progression in the art of Debussy which there is in
Wagner	ORGANIZATION	's a progression which permitted the com - poser of the third act of Tristan to write Die
Meis	PERSON	- tersinger and , afterward ,
Parsifal	LOCATION	.

		Debussy 's was an art , mature already in his quartet , that rounded it - self out during twenty-five years of his life .

		His death robbed us of no fair development we might reasonably have anticipated .

		Indeed , in his very last works , the gold is spread more thinly , the emotion is less warm .

		He had completely fulfilled himself .

		His age had demanded of him an art that it might hold far from the glare and tumult , an art into which it could retreat , an art which could com - pensate it for a life become too cruel and demanding .

		And this he gave it , in perhaps imperishable form .

		PAUL
ROSENFELD	PERSON	.

		The Unrelegated Quill O NE OF THE minor after-war adjustments is a sort of cerebral spring-cleaning which invariably sends a lot of pretty notions to one 's mental junk - heap .

		The plush albums and what-nots of the mind are out of harmony with new conceptions of interior decoration , and must go into the discard .

		It is in some such dusting about in corners that one is impelled to abandon the theory that certain de - vices , of our civilization have succeeded in their con - spiracy to discredit the writing of letters .

		And it is surprising to discover how well entrenched the idea has become .

		All such facilities somewhat ironically labeled `` modern conveniences '' as the telephone at one 's elbow , the telegraph office at the corner , typewriters and social secretaries , have been jointly and severally accused , and we have been quite content to tuck them snugly under one blanket indictment , and thus give them credit for a dev - astation beyond their deserts .

		Sheer repetition of the remark that `` no one writes letters any more '' put the observation in the realm of the unques - tioned gave it , in fact , a certain social standing .

		We were trapped into a false security , and it was not until the war came along and tumbled us out of it that we realized how far from moribund the art of correspondence really is .

		Instead of framing the obituary of letter writing , everyone appears to be writing letters .

		1919 THE DIAL 141 Doubtless the telephone , and its co-conspirators did play a part in an attempt to outmode the pen , but it has become apparent within recent months that their success was destined to be fleeting not final .

		These poisoners of the ink-wells have failed in their large purpose .

		The pen and the sword , linked for so long in the old proverb , have again revealed their kinship in a new manner .

		The sluice gates are opened ; once more there is a free flow of ink .

		But that is not the full extent of what has happened .

		Not only has war shattered the letter - writing inhibitions , in so far as they were operative ; but it has shattered publishers ' aversions to the traffic in letters as a business hazard .

		One hesitates to say which is the greater havoc the undoing of the inhibitions or the undoing of the aversions , but the consequences of the two in conjunction have resulted in an apparently inexhaustible flood of letters especially letters from the front .

		It has seemed as though letters no sooner got written than they got printed .

		They began to stream steadily into newspaper columns , into maga - zines , and into books .

		Any missive which passed the military censor became ipso facto eligible for the market .

		Collections of letters threatened to become as numerous and as miscellaneous as collec - tions of relics .

		Had it not been for the sudden termination of hostilities , which doubtless has checked the momentum of the flood , it is difficult to say where we might not have been carried at its crest .

		In fact , it began to appear that the most feasible method of dealing with the outpouring would be upon a basis of military rather than of literary rank , although the problem of promotion might have proved baffling .

		In any event , the har - vest of recent books serves to reveal how far from vanquished the ancient practice of writing letters really is and how adequately it has been reassert - ing itself .

		We may rest assured that the letters if not the spirit of the war will be preserved .

		As for those devices which sought to supplant the quill , they have been relegated to their former role that of mere go-between in the humdrum business of making and canceling engagements , of taking and canceling orders .

		They failed utterly to loosen our hold upon the older mode of com - munication .

		While the reactions of an army may be recorded by wire , the reactions of an individual demand a more sensitized medium .

		To grasp the full significance of this epistolary renaissance , one need but glance back over the ante - bellum decade .

		What was it this pre-war period in which we were allegedly `` too busy to write let - ters '' ?

		As one seeks for some distinguishing mark , one is tempted to designate it as the age of the souvenir postcard a universal medium of exchange .

		Its applications to the exigencies of existence ap - peared almost endless .

		If one went on a vacation , one played a variation of the English game of `` hare and hounds , '' with postcard `` views '' to mark one 's trail .

		When one wished to be humorous , one mailed an appropriate `` comic '' card , acquired in one of the `` shops '' which flourished and even yet enjoy a diminished vogue in the vicinity of railroad sta - tions .

		If one visited an `` amusement park '' in which , one may do everything but be amused it was considered desirable to acquire several `` views '' of it .

		One could discharge one 's social obligations simply by `` placing a one-cent stamp here . ''

		Just how much joy the recipient of a boat house or city hall facsimile succeeded in extracting from the cardboard is a detail which has never been suffici - ently studied .

		The chances are that he got as much as he deserved .

		However , war is no tourists ' attraction .

		There is more to be written than may be crowded into the confines of the `` correspondence space '' things too intimate to be sent unsheathed through the mails .

		There are dramatic things to be said and one can hardly be dramatic on a postcard .

		`` The blot which ended my last sentence was not entirely my fault .

		A shell landed at the entrance to our dug-out , killed one runner , wounded two , and blew the candle out . ''

		These sentences , from The Love of an Unknown Soldier -LRB- Lane ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB- , are inconceivable upon a postcard , for they would be robbed of all sig - nificance .

		It appears to be a common characteristic of prac - tically all this war correspondence that it carries a certain degree of literary polish .

		You discover little of the hasty scribbling of the postcard era .

		Taking into consideration the reputed disabilities of the average citizen , when it comes to the graces of communication , it must be admitted that he has done himself proud .

		The volume mentioned above is a case in point .

		Incidentally , it differs from the main body of the war correspondence in that the author 's identity is unknown , that the manuscript was found in a dug-out , and that the girl to whom the love letters were addressed is equally anony - mous .

		The publisher emphatically admits that he is publishing the volume in the hope that it will be the means of finding `` the American girl , who , all unknowingly , had quickened the last days of this unknown soldier 's life with romance . ''

		Bearing in mind that this continued confession of love was not to be mailed until the end of the war and possibly not even then one finds one 's credulity a bit overstrained occasionally .

		Under the circumstances the officer might write `` I must leave 142 THE DIAL
February 8	DATE	off something is happening , '' when he is inter - rupted by the signal of an attack , but it is more reasonable to imagine that he would simply `` leave off '' and do his explaining later on .

		This sort of parading of the dramatic effectives occurs frequently .

		As a spontaneous outpouring of soul , The Love of an Unknown Soldier reveals a literary morale which never wavers .

		There are sentences which touch the imagination .

		`` I have seen so many men rise up in the morning and lie still at night . ''

		`` These unposted letters , written out of loneliness , make the future seem too valuable .

		You ran up the steps without turning your head when we separated .

		That 's the way I would pre - .

		fer to go out of life . ''

		He speaks of the English , `` who do magnificent things and voice them in the language of stable-boys , '' and of the French : `` I wish to God we Anglo-Saxons shared some of the vices that produce their virtues . ''


Jack Wright	PERSON	, in A Poet of the Air -LRB-
Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , is another of the correspondents who cherished the public even in the most private of his letters .

		The people who were to buy the book in which his letters appear were never quite excluded from his mind , nor from his epistles .

		Un - restraint and egotism and poetic felicity are com - pounded in his pages .

		Asked what he thought of
France	LOCATION	, it is not likely that he would have answered with the flourish with which he writes : ``
Paris	LOCATION	is for me a Babylon and the country of
France	LOCATION	is for me a plain overflowing with the fever of the Huns ; the incense of bursting shells and smoking powder . ''

		This is letter writing from the rostrum .

		Of course the key to much of this one-sidedness in published letters lies in the blue-penciling of their editors .

		The editors have been , in many in - stances , relatives and relatives exercise a rigid cen - sorship sometimes .

		The flights of fancy are garnered , but the prosaic grumblings are deftly ex - cluded .

		The transient discomforts have ne place in the record beside the felicities of phrase .

		That , perhaps , is why such details even when they do creep into the narrative are so touched with the gloss of humor that nearly all trace of the actuality has been swept away .

		Wainwright Merrill writes , in A College Man in Khaki -LRB-
Doran	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , that `` here the ensemble is a sort of quintessence of mud , piles of brick , jagged earth , mud , banging lorries , booming , and mud . ''

		And in another place , `` the little village fully justifies its name nom de guerre ` Codford-in-the-Mud . ' ''

		Surely this must refer to a substance far more amenable than the stuff which clings to one 's boots , and splashes into one 's ears .

		Sheer modesty doubtless dictates the excision of many lines .

		A favorite aunt may make wonderful crullers , but she naturally shrinks from having the fact blazoned to posterity .

		Hence , when the youth - ful enthusiast begins to compare army fare with memories of her cooking to the utter discredit of the nation 's commissariat , it is time to wield the shears .

		These intimacies must be stricken from the record .

		And it is not fitting to expose little details of finan - cial stringency , such as happen in the best regulated squads , to unsympathetic readers .

		Such incidents are , in the abrupt Americanism , `` nobody 's business . ''

		The sight-seeing instincts come to the surface in these American letters , as though many of their authors aware that they were enjoying their first European tour kept a finger on their pulse to measure their reactions .

		This kaleidoscopic flare for the historic , this eagerness to thrust a pin through each passing impression , makes itself apparent par - ticularly in the
Merrill	ORGANIZATION	volume , where the writer reveals an impatience to crowd everything into one paragraph .

		There is n't much of
London	LOCATION	left over after a few pages of such characteristic cataloguing as this : My eyes darted right the
Adelphi	LOCATION	, yes , far down ; behind it I knew were Covent Garden ,
Maiden Lane	ORGANIZATION	, and old
Drury	ORGANIZATION	.

		Boardings , significantly new , covered corners of two buildings : the Hun had come to `` mighty
London	LOCATION	'' not long since but that thought was chased gaily away by our wheeling left of course .

		The Grand ahead , high and dark !

		Then , behind a big ` bus , a lion couchant , black-grey !

		Whistling and swaying we went ; people laughing ; a kid messenger 's pill-box oscillating as he * chewed something ; `` Canidians , wot ' o ! ''

		: then I felt the imposing triumphal arch of the
New Admiralty	ORGANIZATION	over against me , tall square and grey the Mall be - yond , yes and we swung into the Square . ''

		But the letters which have attained the distinction of publication must be but the chosen representatives of the great body of our epistolary renascence .

		They do little more than shadow forth the real bulk of the outpouring much of which is destined never to know the permanence of book covers .

		Some of it , of course , will make its appearance at a later day , possibly in the guise of memoirs or as source ma - terial in the threshing out of historic controversy .

		And then there will be the cherished personal missives well-thumbed messengers about which will cluster the memory of anxious days and unex - pressed ' but ever present fears .

		These are the let - ters which , tied with ribbon in neat packets , ulti - mately will find their way into the sacred corners of old trunks to be almost forgotten for a time , and then to be unwrapped with trembling fingers the stuff of dreams and fireside reverie .

		THE DIAL
GEORGE DONLIN JOHN DEWEY ROBERT MORSS LOVETT	PERSON	, Editor
CLARENCE BRITTEN	PERSON	In Charge of the Reconstruction Program :
THORSTEIN VEBLEN HAROLD STEARNS HELEN MAROT	PERSON	- T J_H .

		HE GOVERNMENT is LEFT BY THE CONCLUSION of the war in possession of immense stores of muni - tions of all kinds , including vast quantities of ex - plosives and poison gas .

		Some of this material can be converted to peaceful uses for example the De - partment of Agriculture is said to have a use for the 80,000,000 unexploded pounds of
TNT	ORGANIZATION	.

		If the expected revision of the rules of war takes place , poison gas may be outlawed in future , along with submarines , and the only problem will be to set free the accumulation of this substance without injury to animal and vegetable life .

		There are other prod - ucts of our feverish period of preparation , spiritual instead of material , but no less explosive and poisonous because intangible .

		In order to bring the nation to a maximum of efficiency for war it was thought necessary to develop a large quantity of hate for our enemies .

		The systematic production of this force was undertaken by newspapers and magazines , by moving-picture houses and patriotic societies , by schools and churches .

		It was frequently remarked that hate seemed of little use at the front , but throughout the population at large it was re - garded as a valuable aid in preparing for the draft , in selling bonds , in maintaining morale in general so much so in fact that persons who objected on grounds of national self-respect to the production of hate through the invention of atrocity stories were informed that they were interfering with the success of their country at war , much as if they had opposed the floating of its loans or the drafting of its soldiers .

		Even during the war the hate generated for use against our enemies produced untoward results like the explosion of ammunition at
Black Tom	ORGANIZATION	and
Halifax	LOCATION	.

		More than once the President raised his chiding voice to rebuke those enthusiastic spirits whose hate for
Germany	LOCATION	would not permit them to grant a legal trial - to Americans who hated less than they .

		But now that the war is over and our object is no longer victory but peace , it is clear that the presence of this commodity is likely seri - ously to embarrass us .

		It undoubtedly embarrassed the President at the moment when the Germans requested an armistice .

		Our hatred demanded un - conditional surrender , a march to
Berlin	LOCATION	, the laying waste of German territory to an extent equal to the devastated regions of
France	LOCATION	and
Belgium	LOCATION	.

		It forced the President to adopt a tone which dimin - ished the chance that the new German Government could hold its footing between Junkers and radicals , and even so it supported the indictment brought against him by
Roosevelt	PERSON	and Lodge .

		President
Wilson	PERSON	was called pro-German in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	of the
United States	LOCATION	, and repudiated at the polls .

		In the ten weeks that have elapsed since the armistice was signed this hatred has made it impossible for the leaders of opinion in this country to formulate any consistent or dignified policy toward our late enemies .

		But already there are frequent signs that astute and far-seeing journalists are beginning to realize that hate , however essential in war , is dan - gerous to the peace of mutual self-interest , the structure of which is being so painfully laid that the explosives and poisonous gas must somehow be drawn off or neutralized .

		The gingerly way in which they approach their task is evidence of their wholesome fear of being blown up .

		For instance , Mr.
Grasty	PERSON	in the
New York Times	ORGANIZATION	reminds us that `` with all of the barbarism of Germans in the war , they have certain qualities order , discipline , thoroughness .

		Because we justly despise the Germans for their brutality and militarism is no reason why the Allies as victors in the war should not employ the German qualities to stabilize
Central Europe	LOCATION	. ''

		The
New York Evening Post	ORGANIZATION	is equally guarded . ''

		We do not love the Germans ... but ... we recall that they owe the victims of
Germany	LOCATION	's on - slaught on civilization billions of money .

		The sooner they straighten out their affairs and get to work , the sooner they will be able to pay . ''

		Self - interest that is undoubtedly the best neutralizing agent for poisonous hate .

		But a large portion of our hatred is undoubtedly too recalcitrant to yield to this treatment .

		It can doubtless be resolved by signal penalties inflicted on those who can be held personally responsible for the war .

		Prpbably no statesmen believes that such personal punishment has the slightest relation to the aims for which the war was fought , and yet all agree in the utility of such punishment as a means of satisfying the hatred of their peoples .

		It might be well for the world if the
Kaiser	PERSON	could thus become the scapegoat , if he could be miraculously preserved to suffer the tortures invented for him by imaginative ladies over their knitting .

		Failing this it is to be feared that no little residue of hate will remain a constituent 144 THE DIAL
February 8	DATE	of our national atmosphere .

		Deprived of its original destination , it is already being directed elsewhere by able manipulators .

		Months ago prudent men began to turn hatred for
Germany	LOCATION	against the Bol - sheviki of
Russia	LOCATION	and those who in this country asked a hearing for them .

		Other unpopular groups readily suggest themselves as likely to become the residuary legatees of the superfluous hatred left by the war the ^ .

		Non-partisan League , the I.W.W. , the
Oriental / the Negro	ORGANIZATION	.

		Now these groups and the questions which they raise are precisely those which in the interests of our own social well-being as well as that of countless millions of our fellow men should be treated honestly ^ dispassionately , gen - erously .

		They remind us that the demobilization of hate should be the immediate object of those who have the civic as well as the spiritual welfare of the country at heart .

		It may be hoped that some effort in this direction will be initiated , now that the war is over , by that class whp believe and teach that their Lord came to earth and said : '' Love your enemies , bless them that curse you , do good to them that hate you , and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you . ''

		J.HE RUSSIAN PROBLEM IS NOT THE ONLY ONE affecting
Asia	LOCATION	which will come before the
Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the long run the peace of the world may depend even more upon
China	LOCATION	than upon Rus - sia .

		No one in his senses even though some of the French have parted temporarily with theirs believes that
Russia	LOCATION	can permanently be governed from outside itself .

		Disorganization in
China	LOCATION	is almost as great as in
Russia	LOCATION	, and
China	LOCATION	never has been a great power .

		In other words , it is one of the countries that has been regarded as the Happy Hunting Grounds for the
Great Powers	ORGANIZATION	.

		Few realize how far the parceling out has gone , or the extent to which the path from the Open Door leads into secret and blind alleys of foreign exploitation .

		Superficially the report -LRB- which is probably authen - tic -RRB- seems reassuring that
China	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	have agreed upon the policy to be pursued by
China	LOCATION	at the
Conference	ORGANIZATION	.

		When this report is backed by semi-official news that
Tsingtao	ORGANIZATION	will be returned by
Japan	LOCATION	to
China	LOCATION	, the omens seem most propitious .

		All the more disquieting then are the rumors coming from the
Far East	LOCATION	that
Japan	LOCATION	has exercised tremen - dous pressure , diplomatic and financial , upon
China	LOCATION	to determine the
Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	program of the latter .

		It is even said that some demands are included only because they are sure of rejection , and
Japan	LOCATION	can then make the better claim to be
China	LOCATION	's real friend .

		Others are said to be more in the interest of
Japan	LOCATION	than of
China	LOCATION	.

		One circumstantial story goes so far as to say that one of the Chinese delegates was detained in
Tokyo	LOCATION	to make him sign a promise that certain questions would not be raised by
China	LOCATION	at
Paris	LOCATION	this even though it is stated that Japanese pressure had already controlled the selection of Chinese delegates .

		These rumors come from the foreign settlements in Peking .

		They are ex parte and partisan .

		But they follow upon reports of activities of
Japan	LOCATION	in
China	LOCATION	during the war that are most sinister .

		Wholesale opium smuggling with government connivance is the most unpleasant , but not the most serious , of these tales .

		They are to the effect that
Japan	LOCATION	has subsidized the militarists of the north in order to keep
China	LOCATION	weak and divided ; that all sorts of loans have been made merely to involve
China	LOCATION	hopelessly ; that bribery is regularly resorted to .

		in order to get concessions of railways , mines , and forests ; that the famous or infamous demands of the twenty-one points have been with - drawn only because the Japanese faction which is now uppermost believes that the conquest of
China	LOCATION	can be effected better by economic means than by military .

		These reports are not proved .

		But also they are not put in circulation by merely irresponsi - ble parties .

		The concentration of interest upon
Europe	LOCATION	has cooperated with the censorship to keep us all ignorant of the vast conflict of factions and interests going on in
China	LOCATION	.

		The rumors , even if not adequately authenticated , are worth setting down .

		They , as well as the facts behind them , declare the necessity for the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	.

		They make apparent even more what kind of League it should be .

		Only some permanent body having scientific experts constantly in its service can ascertain the facts .

		Only such a body can command attention and belief for its reports .

		Only such a body can investigate and report without exciting all sorts of nationalistic suspicions and hatreds , and without itself becoming an instrumentality of intrigue .

		Secret diplomacy is not limited to treaties .

		Our whole .

		international life goes on in secrecy .

		It is this secrecy which allows rumors to flourish which are abominable if they are false , because they carry the seeds of distrust and war .

		It is secrecy which permits the abominable events to occur , if the rumors turn out to be justified .

		Only an interna - tional agency can introduce real publicity based on knowledge of facts into - the situation .

		The nee , d is most crying when colonies , backward regions , spheres of influence and
Siberia	LOCATION	and
China	LOCATION	are in question .

		ACTUAL OUTCOME OF THE RECENT DECISIONS of the
Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	is a remarkable , if to a great extent unconscious , disappearance of the pre - rogatives of
State	ORGANIZATION	sovereignty in the old-fashioned sense .

		This is especially true of smaller nations .

		For what is happening in
Paris	LOCATION	in the field of diplo - macy is much like what has happened for some time past in the field of industry consolidation and amalgamation , the big interests becoming bigger and the smaller , smaller .

		The real importance of these incidents lies in their illustration of a fundamental difficulty facing a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	in which the smaller powers , theoretically equal before the law exactly as all private citizens are theoretically equal before it within any civilized state , are from an
1919	DATE	THE DIAL economic and industrial point of view practically impotent and dependent upon the crumbs of favors of the great powers .

		Just as small competing busi - nesses have been , in this era of large-scale corpora - tions , to a great extent eliminated , so are the smaller nations coming to count less and less in the more extensive decisions of world policy of trade , finance , commerce , and industry .

		The truth is , sovereignty in the old-fashioned nationalistic sense has become a misnomer except for the great powers and even with them , it is rapidly becoming a tenuous and fragile possession however much Republican Sena - tors rage against a Le * ague of
Nations	ORGANIZATION	.

		Nations are no longer sufficient unto themselves .

		No matter how adequate and flexible a system of representation is devised for individual countries within the frame - work of a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	, what will really deter - mine decisions of world polity will 1 be the interplay of economic and industrial forces bigger than national boundaries .

		The groupings will be of a type necessarily different from that in the old days when nations were self-sufficient and self-supporting blocs , with a numerical weight of men who could take up arms .

		What we are witnessing is the passing of the old order of national irresponsible sovereignty .

		And there are few left today to weep over its expected demise .

		WHY ARE THE AMERICAN AND FRENCH Gov - ernments so interested in supporting the Paderewski faction in
Poland	LOCATION	?

		Aside from the sinister financial cliques in both countries , which are frankly desirous of a reactionary
Poland	LOCATION	as a buffer state between an imperialistic
Germany	LOCATION	on the one hand and a Bol - shevik
Russia	LOCATION	on the other , there are reasons more or less inherent in the genius and national tempera - ment of both
France	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	which make the phenomenon explicable .

		-LRB- How many people in this country showed any concern when our official Gov - ernment in
Washington	LOCATION	failed to interfere with the creation here in
America	LOCATION	of a Polish expeditionary force which was frankly a partisan army ?

		Very few .

		Since our muck-raking days we have accepted with magnificent unconcern the presence in our country of what we aptly term '' an invisible gov - ernment . ''

		We appear to have carried over this do - mestic conception into '' our ideas about foreign policy .

		It never seems to occur to us that
Poland	LOCATION	may some day vigorously resent the entrance of an expedition - ary force carrying the
United States	LOCATION	flag , yet with - out the sanction of the official
American Govern	ORGANIZATION	- ment with which
Poland	LOCATION	must ultimately deal .

		It is evident that
Paderewski	PERSON	and his expeditionary force decided that the people of
Poland	LOCATION	, like the people of this country , would submit gracefully to the imposition of a particular government which , in our own parlance , '' has the goods . ''

		French diplo - matists , with their penchant for intrigue and with their natural inability to believe that a moderate Socialist government such as that of General
Pilsud	PERSON	- ski could possibly succeed in creating a strong na - tion , seem equally determined to make a mockery of the principle of '' self-determination '' which we have apotheosized with so much rhetoric .

		They are backing the
Paderewski	PERSON	faction for all they are worth , utterly indifferent to the fact that the ma - jority of the plain people of
Poland	LOCATION	have shown no interest and no affection for that faction .

		Our genius for an '' invisible government '' and the French genius for intrigue seem to have combined successfully to wreck the prospects of a united
Poland	LOCATION	.

		Only one remedy for this destruction of the fundamental principle of the
League of Na	ORGANIZATION	- tions remains to see that the representatives of
Poland	LOCATION	, which represent the wishes of the Polish people , and not interested cliques in
Paris	LOCATION	, are ad - mitted to the Peace Conference as accredited dele - gates .

		U NE OF THE NOISOME BY-PRODUCTS OF THE recent war is the espionage habit .

		During the past year it has not been unusual to see in the press editorial notices '' Call number '' followed by adjurations to report to the
Department of Justice	ORGANIZATION	words and deeds which might be interpreted as showing hostility or even lack of sympathy toward the American part in the war .

		The
Department of Justice	ORGANIZATION	and the
American Protective League	ORGANIZATION	have prided themselves on the sheer number of cases so reported , however trivial or malicious the grounds .

		It was useless to point out that by encouraging the espionage habit we were fixing on our people one of the worst vices of the Prussian Police system .

		The temptation to the active exercise of patriotism was too strong , and men and women accepted the suggestion to become spies and informers who in saner moments would have spurned the idea .

		How strongly this espionage habit has been fastened on the country , even in the brief period of its exercise , is shown by the novel activity of the
United States Senate	ORGANIZATION	.

		This body has recently emitted two lists of persons whom it desires to brand with pro-German - ism or pacifism .

		The constitution of the lists shows by what methods of irresponsible tattle and gossip they have been made up .

		In this respect they form an accurate mirror of the mind of the country under the influence of the espionage habit , and it is because the country at large so well understood the propensities which produced them that it dismissed the incidents with a humor which was touched with shame .

		The repudiation of responsibility by Secre - tary
Baker	PERSON	, for the
War Department	ORGANIZATION	, represents the better mind of the whole country toward prac - tices which lower the prestige of government and degrade the name of justice .

		In his words the list of infamy becomes one of glory . ''

		In the particular list accredited to Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	there are names of people of great distinction , exalted purity of pur - pose , and lifelong devotion to the highest interests of
America	LOCATION	and of mankind .

		Miss
Jane Addams	PERSON	, for instance , lends dignity and greatness to any list in which her name appears . ''

		146 THE DIAL
February 8	DATE	Communications A LANCE FOR MAX ^ EASTMAN SIR : Mr.
Louis Untermeyer	PERSON	's review of
Max Eastman	ORGANIZATION	's new book of poems Colors of Life which appeared in the issue of THE DIAL of De - cember 28 , has caused me so much bewilderment that I can not refrain from commenting on it .

		The review is so obviously acrimonious , and so delib - erately polemic as to appear almost invidious , much to the detriment of Mr.
Untermeyer	PERSON	's reputation for critical sobriety and equanimity .

		My purpose , however , is not so much to take issues with his judgment of
Max Eastman	PERSON	's art , as to deplore the method by which it is arrived at ; for Mr.
Untermeyer	PERSON	discusses
Eastman	ORGANIZATION	's conception of poetry , as embodied in the splendid preface to the book , for nine-tenths of the review , and devotes only one-tenth to the poems .

		I am indeed surprised that once having decided on this very unconven - tional procedure , Mr.
Untermeyer	PERSON	did not use this last remaining tenth for a scholarly condemnation of the binding and typographical make-up of the book , and ignore altogether the seemingly unimpor - tant fact that perhaps , as I strongly suspect , the book was chiefly intended to present
Eastman	ORGANIZATION	's poetry , and only incidentally to inform us of its author 's opinions of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	,
Whitman	PERSON	, and free verse .

		But whatever may have prompted Mr.
Unter	PERSON	- meyer to follow this extremely original and brilliant method of reviewing a work of art by not saying anything about it , the fact remains that
Max East	PERSON	- man has written a book of verse , and that he is entitled to have it criticized fairly and directly on its own merits , or not at all .

		It is , therefore , to be desired that when Mr.
Eastman	PERSON	writes another book THE DIAL will invest someone other than Mr.
Untermeyer	PERSON	with the judicature unless , of course , Mr.
Eastman	PERSON	gives up his bad habit of writing prefaces and excoriating free verse .

		In the meantime , there is one thing that I can not let pass unchallenged , and that is the statement that Mr.
Eastman	PERSON	is '' an artist anxious to capture beauty , rather than a captor driven by it . ''

		This , allowing that it is true , seems to me a mere quibble , for surely the pursuit of beauty is as much a part of the creation of it as the pursuit of liberty is a condition of its inauguration .

		But it is not true , for much of
Eastman	ORGANIZATION	's poetry is so replete with genuine and spontaneous beauty as to miss some of the more rugged , and by no means less poetical aspects of life , a fact that most of his friends sincerely regret .

		I need only call the attention of the interested reader to a single poem ,
Hours	ORGANIZATION	, to bear out my assertion ; for to me at least , those six lines are the most beauti - ful and exquisite in their particular field that have been written in many a year .

		But I am afraid that Mr.
Untermeyer	PERSON	has over - looked this poem , with many others , if the only one he can quote is At the Aquarium , whose appearance in an earlier volume has won for its author the reputation of being the foremost poetical ichthyolo - gist in
America	LOCATION	.

		The singling out of this aquatic feat from so much terra firma reveals the whole motive of Mr.
Untermeyer	PERSON	's review .

		Decidedly , he was fishing for something .

		But then , why not say , like the Roman gladiator to his Gallic opponent who wore a fish on his helmet : '' Non te peto , pis - cem peto quid me fugis ,
Galle	LOCATION	? ''

		POETRY IN THE LABORATORY SIR : I think Mr.
John Gould Fletcher	PERSON	is unfair to Dr.
Patterson	PERSON	.

		In his article , A Rational Ex - planation of Vers Libre , he does not for a moment make clear that Dr.
Patterson	PERSON	is a scientist wha has made important contributions to a little known science .

		It is a mistake to dismiss '' this atmosphere of the laboratory '' as Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	does .

		In olden days art and science were one , and art can be but superficial which does not make use of the wisdom collected in the data of scientific experiments .

		Vers Libre is composed by the aborigines of Aus - tralia , by the Negro in
West Indian Islands	LOCATION	, and by all '' primitive '' folk .

		Its introduction into poetry coincides with the primitive turn given to art by
Cezanne	ORGANIZATION	,
Van Gogh	PERSON	, and
Gaugain	PERSON	and with the development of the sciences of anthropology and ethnology , and the '' back to nature '' movement in dancing and in music .

		The Psalms as translated in the English Bible are vers libres .

Washington	LOCATION	, D. C. AUTOMATIC vs. AUTOCRATIC SIR : The excellent article by Mr.
Roe	PERSON	in THE DIAL of
January	DATE	n suggests two important points in the question of free speech which are worthy of some elaboration .

		In the first place we can now see that some of the - important liberties which we sur - rendered in wartime are not to be restored to us automatically .

		If we get them back we shall have to fight for them .

		They are in the hands of the autocracy which we thought necessary to win the war , and this autocracy can urge plausi - ble reasons for the further suppression of them .

		And autocracies do not relinquish powers where there is any possibility of retaining them .

		In the second place , we should note that the organization of the people to wrest their rights from an autocratic officialdom is a tremendously difficult task .

		The agencies of social control are everywhere in the hands of the
Government	ORGANIZATION	and terrific pressure can be brought to bear on all indi - viduals restive under restraint .

		The people are likely to learn in this present upheaval that relin - quished civil liberties are not restored to them graciously by an autocratic officialdom which finds - advantage in restraining such liberties .

		148 THE DIAL February 8 Notes on New Books THE GARDEN OF SURVIVAL .

		By
Algernon Blackwood	PERSON	.

		Button ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		To read
Blackwood	PERSON	is to descend into a valley where the mists lie mists that soften and subdue the outlines of reality .

		Often these mists bring a breath of enchantment and mystery , and yet there are other times when they merely react upon the reader as a sort of esthetic damp .

		Occasionally one wishes that
Blackwood	PERSON	might come up into the sunlight , instead of delving in the shadows , flitting from the phantasy that is half-formed to the phan - tasy that is half-uttered .

		In the case of the present book it is difficult to lay one 's finger upon the pre - cise flaw , yet we suspect that the secret lies in the author 's so complete absorption in his method that he permits a false harmony to creep into his mate - rials .

		In spite of all the expert modeling , he has not made us forget the clay .

		Blackwood sets himself to unfold the conception that out of an imperfect and unequal love there comes a perfection of beauty .

		His starting point is the marriage between a man and a woman who are not mated .

		He descends into flashiness by having the woman meet death in an automobile accident a month later .

		And from these ingredients he seeks to clothe his thought the belief that '' those who loved beauty and lived it in their lives follow that same ideal with increasing power afterwards and for - ever . ''

		Had he chosen a more harmonic set of facts , a more ideal framework , he might have heightened the beauty of what he sought to interpret .

		The weakness of the book is not in its message , but in the early part of the narrative which is hot attuned to the idealistic pinioning which is to follow .

		NEWSPAPER BUILDING .

		By
Jason Rogers	PERSON	.

		Harper ;
$ 5	MONEY	.

		The application of efficiency to editing , to mechan - ical production , to circulation , and advertising , is the main thesis of this interesting book .

		Curiously enough , the opening chapters are devoted to a study of the personalities and methods of
Melville E. Stone	ORGANIZATION	and
Victor F. Lawson	PERSON	of the
Chicago News	ORGANIZATION	,
Colonel Nelson	PERSON	of the
Kansas City Star	LOCATION	,
Adolph S. Ochs	PERSON	of the
New York Times	ORGANIZATION	, and others .

		Out of this concrete study of previously successful news - papers , Mr.
Rogers	PERSON	and his associates built up the
New York Globe	ORGANIZATION	into a paying newspaper property .

		The various problems were subjected to a - searching analysis , and out of that thorough study the best methods of conducting the various departments of the paper were worked out .

		In the present state of competition and high cost of production only the most ably and most skilfully edited and conducted newspaper can attain enduring success .

		A mixture of brains and wise methods on the business side is as necessary as on the editorial side .

		The right kind of building , a knowledge of costs in both labor and material , a budget system , a clear understanding of conditions , and an exact knowledge of income and outgo are necessary today .

		Guessing at half and multiplying by two lead to failure .

		.

		A chart or graph pictures the leaks .

		This book is an interesting and vivid presentation of the business methods plus the enthusiasm mixed with brains necessary to make a newspaper a financial success and also to make it a permanent and influential factor in the community .

		The price of the volume seems excessive , although the book gives the results of years of study of the newspaper business freely and with great frankness .

		MADAME ROLAND : A STUDY IN REVOLUTION .

		By Mrs.
Pope-Hennessy	PERSON	.

		Dodd ,
Mead	LOCATION	;
$ 5	MONEY	.

		By our readiness to let our thoughts revert from time to time to
Madame Roland	ORGANIZATION	we acknowledge that nothing is so attractive in the long run as per - sonality .

		Product of conditions that gave birth to that doctrinaire and futile revolutionary type , the Girondist Republican , she proved that she alone of her numerous political family possessed the energy and persistance necessary for leadership in critical times .

		And that leadership she often exercised , though just as often she refused to do so , at least openly , because the age had a strong prejudice -LRB- which she fully shared -RRB- against la femme politique .

		Even her Prison Memoirs , frank and proud confes - sions of fully emancipated , political opinions , show an anxiety as laughable as it is sincere , to reduce her role in the councils of the Girondist group to the proportions of the good wife who plied her needle and listened while her betters held the floor .

		Her newest biographer was able to uncover so many of these modestly concealed trails that we shall be obliged henceforth to accept her as the only leader the poor
Gironde	LOCATION	ever had .

		This is perhaps the special contribution of the book , which shows quite conclusively that the party policy adopted in the great crisis of
1793	DATE	and calling for a federal organi - zation of
France	LOCATION	as well as for a departmental guard for the Convention , was her work .

		True , with these ill-starred measures she broke the necks of her Girondist friends and , incidentally , her own , but one is tempted to think that if circumstances had per - mitted her to act as field general for her party instead of being just a secret , unofficial chief of staff , the Girondists might have come out on top .

		- However , there was Danton no , she could never have won against the elemental energy of an adversary who very accurately took her measure when he said : '' In revolutions one does n't write , one acts . ''

		Beside
Danton	PERSON	, savior of his country through action , she shrivels to a little quill-driving blue-stocking .

		The author has a singularly just outlook enabling her to range in orderly perspective the crowding figures and forces of the Revolution .

		In consequence of this happy poise she steadily holds her heroine to the human level and makes her political illusions as palatable as her sprightly wit , her love of nature , and her extraordinary gift for friendship .

		CAMPS AND TRAILS IN
CHINA	LOCATION	.

		By
Roy Chap	PERSON	- man
Andrews	PERSON	and
Yvette Borup Andrews	PERSON	.

		Appleton ;
$ 3	MONEY	.

		Mr. and Mrs.
Andrews	PERSON	tell the story of the Asiatic Zoological Expedition in a manner calcu - lated to appeal to popular taste .

		Yiin-nan , a prov - ince in southwestern
China	LOCATION	, was selected as the region in which the main work of the expedition was to be conducted .

		This province is about the size of
California	LOCATION	, and , says Mr.
Andrews	PERSON	, it is safe to say that in no similar area of the world is there such a variety of language and dialects as in this region .

		Its faunaL range is also very wide .

		In
Fukien Province	LOCATION	, whither the party first went , the author spent several weeks vainly hunting the '' blue tiger , '' an elusive man-eater that had long been spreading terror in the region .

		Curiously enough , a more interesting chapter is that which vividly describes a cave tenanted by thousands of bats , and the manner in which Mrs.
Andrews	PERSON	braved its terrors in the cause of science . ''

		All about is the swish of ghostly wings which brush her face or neck , and the air is full of chattering noises like the grinding of hundreds of tiny teeth .

		Some - times a soft little body plumps into her lap . ''

		Any but a naturalist 's wife would find a blue tiger far more desirable company !

		The scientific reputation of the expedition , as the preface points out , will rest upon the technical reports of its work , which will be published in due course by the
American Museum of Natural	ORGANIZATION	His - tory .

		` The book includes , besides the data on the fauna of the regions visited , references to the state of Chinese politics in the days of 1916-17 , the social and religious customs of the inhabitants , and numer - ous more or less lively adventures .

		MEN OF THE OLD STONE AGE : Their En - vironment , Life and Art .

		By
Henry Fair	PERSON	- field
Osborn	PERSON	.

		Scribner ;
$ 3.50	MONEY	.

		Here is a popular edition , at a considerably reduced price , of Professor
Osborn	PERSON	's synthesis of knowledge of our Paleolithic predecessors .

		With its wealth of first-rate illustrative material it repre - sents a valuable compendium for teachers , both as to the anatomical and the archeological finds .

		The very full account of Magdalenian arj : doubtless forms one of the most attractive features of the book .

		As to the precise value of the restorations from ancient human remains , opinions will differ .

		Doubt - less they help to visualize what Paleolithic man may have looked like , but the probable error as to the soft parts is a large one which may not be appre - ciated by the laity .

		Every book of this type suffers from the difficulty that it must keep in view the disparate needs of several classes of readers of pro- fessional colleagues , of students , of the cultured layman .

		The author 's endeavor has evidently been to omit nothing that is in any way significant , and while this renders his book a most convenient work of reference , a certain amount of judicious skipping is advisable for the general reader .

		Thus the latter will be less interested in the history of all the vari - ous Neanderthal finds and their minor variations than in the general characteristics of this human type .

		However , the success of the work from the publisher 's point of view may possibly indicate a greater willingness to wrestle with scientific detail than was even recently noticeable among the
Ameri	LOCATION	- can public .

		There can be no doubt that on the whole
Osborn	PERSON	's book is the most useful general treatment in English at once sounder and more up-to-date than Sollas ' Ancient Hunters , its only serious rival .

		AMERICAN RAILWAY ACCOUNTING .

$ 3	MONEY	.

		PRINCIPLES IN ACCOUNTING .

		By
W. A. Paton	PERSON	and
R. A. Stevenson	PERSON	.

		Macmillan ;
$ 3-25	MONEY	.

		The government control of the railroads brought about by the war has relegated to the scrap heap much of the regulation previously practised .

		The one definite result which remains of the work of the
Interstate Commerce Commission	ORGANIZATION	since its estab - lishment in
1887	DATE	is the standardization of railroad accounts .

		Chiefly responsible for that standardiza - tion has been Professor
Henry C. Adams	PERSON	, who was in charge of the statistical and accounting work of the
Commission	ORGANIZATION	from
1887	DATE	to
1911	DATE	, and who has worked out a scientific method of accounting .

		Originally Professor
Adams	PERSON	intended to write .

		a book on the abuses and uses of railway accounts , which would have led to a criticism of most that had been done relative to rate regulation .

		Instead he has written a commentary on the standard system of railway accounts used by American railways .

		Accounting , according to the author , is the de - termination of relative equities : it can claim the dignity of science because it is subject to the strict rules of formal logic .

		The language used is that of figures and the underlying conception is that of a mathematical equation .

		Exactness , as in any other science , is the end sought .

		Hence the railway ac - countant is not so much a bookkeeper as an execu - tive , personally responsible for the observation of all accounting rules and thus subject to accounting principles instead of , as formerly , to the whims of a superior officer .

		This of course does not mean that the peculiarities of the business must not be

		THE DIAL
February 8	DATE	studied .

		Professor
Adams	PERSON	does this in an illuminat - ing chapter concerning the structure of a system of railway accounts .

		The details involved in construc - tion costs prior and after operation are shown * to have a vital relation to the questions of investment and surplus as well as to renewals and betterments .

		In his last five chapters the author discusses with scientific thoroughness operating expenses and revenues , the income account , profit and loss ac - counts , and the general balance sheet accounts .

		Not the least valuable part of the book is the appendices , which reprint the classifications promulgated by the
Interstate Commerce Commission	ORGANIZATION	.

		The influence of the ideas on railway accounting outlined in the above noted volume can be seen in Principles of Accounting .

		The authors use to some extent the terms adopted by the Interstate Com -
merce Commission	ORGANIZATION	in its prescribed classification as representing the most logical system of accounting phraseology at present developed .

		The whole field of accounting , however , is covered under the rubrics of elements of accounting , the equity accounts , the interest problem , the valuation of assets , the construc - tion and analysis of financial statements , and special fields of accounting .

		Further laboratory material is furnished in the appendices .

		The book is in - tended for the student of economics who desires a broad training in accounting principles as a part of general educational equipment .

		The general reader will also find it valuable and interesting because it is based on logical and scientific principles .

		Details have been subordinated and the result is an eminent - ly suggestive and valuable work .

		The appearance of these two books is an encouraging sign of the times in that scientific principles and ideas are being applied in business .

		Guessing at half and multiply - ing by two is rapidly becoming obsolete .

		A scienti - fic methqd of accounting is the foundation for cor - poration honesty and general business efficiency as well as for the regulation of public utilities or ef - ficient government ownership .

		THE CATSKILLS .

		By
T. Morris Longstreth	PERSON	.

		Century ;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		Go to the
Catskills	LOCATION	in
April	DATE	, and you will not only avoid the depressing horde of ''
summer	DATE	boarders '' that seem to lurk behind every stone wall and corn - stalk in that region , but you will find its modicum of scenic attraction in one of its most inspiring phases .

		There were yet a few snow flurries to come when the author began a several weeks ' walking trip that had its beginning at
Woodstock	LOCATION	, where artists are wont to congregate , and ended , toward the middle of
June	DATE	, at
Arkville	LOCATION	.

		For company he had a young man native to the mountains , who had never read Rip Van Winkle , but who nevertheless had the advantage of imagination and no little love for the open road .

		Together they saw the ice break up , the snow melt , and the world come to life with the advent of
spring	DATE	.

		They traversed much of the so-called heart of the
Catskills	LOCATION	, climbing mountains , stopping to see
John Burroughs	PERSON	, getting lost on dim trails , and observing all the worthwhile things that seem to hide during vacation months .

		Mr.
Longstreth	PERSON	is something of a philosopher , though by no means an aggressive one .

		He is pleas - ant company in a book , and we find ourselves rather envying the young man who accompanied him on his walking trip .

		The book is provided with an excellent map , and in the back are addenda giving directions to those who would see the Catskills in the same way .

		A HISTORY OF
SPAIN	LOCATION	.

		Founded on the His - toria de
Espana y de la Civilization Espanola of Rafael Altamira	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Charles E. Chapman	PERSON	.

		Macmillan ;
$ 2.60	MONEY	.

		The renaissance of interest in things Spanish may be in part a reflection of the heightened public interest in all international affairs , but it is certain that it was bound to come , and indeed was on its way even before the war lifted us into a conscious cosmopolitanism .

		The Iberian peninsula , to be sure , is neither politically nor economically great as world centers go , and in latter months
Spain	LOCATION	has been con - spicuous chiefly in the dummy part of a chief among neutrals .

		But for all that , the political world can - not , if it would , overlook the fact that the greater
Iberia	ORGANIZATION	in language , law , tradition , and ideals in - cludes more than the whole of ` one of
Earth	LOCATION	's great continents .


Latin America	LOCATION	may never again be merely Spanish in civilization , but it is little likely that it w r ill ever be non-Spanish ; and it is beyond doubt that as time passes it will grow in world importance .

		The part which Spanish culture is yet to play in the affairs of mankind is surely to out - shine aught that
Spain	LOCATION	has achieved in the past : this is clear , and it is a sufficient reason for the growing interest in Spanish history and politics .

		Professor
Chapman	PERSON	's contribution in this field is a book which fills an obvious gap , for he gives us a readable and capable one volume history , compendi - ous in matter yet comprehensive enough in time to cover the whole historic range from the
Cartha	PERSON	- ginian settlements to
Spain	LOCATION	in the great war .

		The work , as the title states , is founded upon the most eminent of Spanish historians , the four volume work of
Altamira	ORGANIZATION	, but it is not merely an abridgment ; the author has written in the light of his own studies and has expressed his own opinions , and the two final chapters , dealing with the period from
1808	DATE	to
1917	DATE	, are entirely his .

		The book 's special claim to originality in addition to an amount of original research and the use of new materials lies in the fact that it endeavors , if not to subordinate the political to the social , economic , and cultural phases of history , at least not to allow them to be over - shadowed by the political narrative .

		This is an aim so wholly laudable , and indeed so well attained within the possibilities of a limited book , that it is near to carping to remark upon its shortcomings or upon the something approaching the pamphleteer 's
1919	DATE	THE DIAL Fifth Printing War Verse EDITED BY FRANK FOXCROFT Editor of '' The Living Age '' '' We are accustomed to think of poetry as the expression of soft-handed , pleasure-loving , even if impoverished , men and women , and have be - lieved that whatever else might be lacking in wooing the muse , quietude was an indispensable essential .

		`` But here is verse written to the accompani - ment of the deafening roar of exploding shells and the anguished cries of the wounded and dying ; and through it all runs that note of a wonderful awe that peculiar conviction of the presence of a Great Miracle the awakening of the god in man . ''

		One feels that to have missed this book would have been an almost irreparable loss , and to have read it is to have acquired an almost unforget - table heartache , and yet over and above all other emotions is the one of exaltation , the positive assurance that the Great War means the triumph of Good over Evil , the end of the old regime of Autocracy and the beginning of the reign of World Democracy .

		CITY TIDES .

		By
Archie Austin Coates	PERSON	.

		Doran ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		THE OTHER SIDE .

		By
Gilbert Frankau	PERSON	.

		Knopf ;
$ i.	MONEY
City Tides	ORGANIZATION	is a compound of the good and evil influences of
Spoon River	LOCATION	.

		At its best , this first book of Mr.
Coates	PERSON	' is an honest , and often colorful , attempt to delve into the human consciousness and unconsciousness and select those rare things which are true beneath the illusions of the commonplace .

		At its worst , it is very thin stuff , psychologically and rhythmically .

		The poorer side is probably due to the fact that one influence other than inspiration and
Masters	ORGANIZATION	played a part in shaping these creations : a newspaper '' column . ''

		That sophisticated brother of the Poets ' Corner does much , perhaps , to arouse the interest of the average reader in things literary ; but there is , too , a tendency to '' smartness '' which is amusing on the way downtown , but which falls flat , for some reason , between the covers of a book .

		Scattered among the free verses of
City Tides	LOCATION	are a few rhymed lyrics and sonnets ; and it is curious to note that when the poet thus restricts himself , he gains an intensity which is so often lacking in his other pieces .

		Felicitously illustrative of this is the first -LRB- and perhaps best -RRB- poem in the book The Ticket-Seller , who rarely sees the faces of his cus - tomers , but more often their hands .

		In his Conscription , Mr.
Coates	PERSON	takes an attitude distinct from that in The Other Side .

		It might be said that the attitude of the American Conscrip - tion was written when he was facing the draft was that of the man who had learned about war from Over the Top , and the attitude of Mr.
Fran	PERSON	- kau that of the man who had learned about war from war .

		There are `` blacker things than death , there are sweeter things than living , Mr.
Coates	PERSON	ro - mantically says in the prospect of the trenches .

		War , says the English soldier , is '' dirty , lousy , loathsome .

		.

		, '' Men disembowelled by guns five miles away , Cursing , with their last breath , the living God Because he made them , in His Image , men .

		Versification plays a much larger part in Mr.
Frankau	PERSON	's book than poetry .

		There is much capital - ization of names and symbols , lending it a
Kipling	LOCATION	- esque effect when taken in conjunction with the meters .

		But there is a sincerity in many of the verses so passionate and whole-hearted that the impression is vividly made of a frank and rather fine nature instantaneously reacting against the false glamour of war when coming into the knowledge of what it actually is , yet not blind to its braveries and austerities .

		And in at least one poem , Music and Wine , there is a charming pathos of thought and expression , beauties remembered : Here in the mud and the rain God , give me
London	LOCATION	again !

		I would lose all earth and the heavens above For just one banquet of laughter and love .

		When my flesh returns to its earth , When my body is dust as my sword ; If one thing I wrought find worth In the eyes of our kindly Lord , I will only ask of his grace That he grant us a lowly place Where his warriors toast him , in heaven above , With wine and laughter , music and love .

		It seems to hold that books not founded upon '' the actual experiences of the author , '' or not crowded with characters '' which the reader would instantly recognize , if their names were given '' are scarcely worth reading , and it probably dismisses The Mikado and Alice in Wonder - land as obviously and equally spurious .

		Fortu - nately this type of mind is not particularly prevalent , , but since it does exist in some measure , one really can not quarrel with fiction writers who cater to it .

		But it is equally true that the kind of fiction which starts out with a certificate of authenticity is seldom endowed with the credentials of genuine imagination .

		This applies to Sergeant
Kendall	PERSON	's book , which de - tails some of the adventures of an officer of the
Royal Northwest	ORGANIZATION	mounted police .

		Fidelity to fact is , in its place , an admirable attribute , but it has here been taken with a literalness that is the antithesis of taste .

		Dealing largely with the apprehension of criminals , the author feels constrained to write with all of a police reporter 's accuracy and less than a police reporter 's imagination .

		Profanity is transcribed , and the course of a bullet traced with care worthy of a better cause .

		And when one comes to the love - scenes , one is hardly prepared to find the Royal Mounted reciting
Marie Corelli	PERSON	stanzas , seven lines long .

		Here the problem is perhaps more for the alienist than for the critic .

		Is this revelation or fiction ?

		Such uniform squalor and bestiality scarcely seems consistent with truth .

		The author appears to have used up his literary faculties on variations of the general themes of sexual degradation and avarice .

		It is not to be de - nied that he has made excellent literary material out of these unpleasant themes , but it is the excel - lence of his handling which makes it so difficult to suppress a question concerning the truth of his tales and sketches .

		Some will develop good behavior others will sharpen the imagination .

		In this book , the games have been carefully planned to do these very things ; and the instructions given are simple and easy to follow . ''

		The clever combination of mental and manual training makes the games doubly valuable .

		THE DIAL
February 8	DATE	of our correct selves , to whom the veiling of emo - tion and desire has become like a sixth sense .

		But whether the tales and sketches are faithful transcrip - tions of truth or merely fiction , they possess force and vitality .

		If Mr.
Evans	PERSON	has not written of the people of
West Wales	LOCATION	, then he has created a new type of peasant and , in any event , his work is literary creation which our moral prejudices or preconcep - tions should not permit us to neglect .

		He has told us of a people who live their lives on a non-moral basis and who are yet so conscious of sin and of their moral responsibility to the Big Man and the `` little white Jesus '' that what might easily have been in - different non-morality becomes gross and repulsive immorality .

		These peasants , in spite of their anthropomorphic religiosity , seem naively uncon - scious that filth is dirty .

		Their God is a primitive patriarch , between whom and themselves there is hardly any barrier of ritual , though at the same time there is no beauty in the communion .

		The Big Man speaks in the vulgar language of the commonest peasant being , one supposes , in common with all gods , a reflection of his worshipers .

		, He does n't hedge himself about with any symbols of divinity though he does insist on being invisible to mortal eyes and may be induced to wink at any subversion of the moral laws , provided that the Respected , or the minister , intercedes -LRB- for a consideration -RRB- on be - half of the sinner .

		`` lanto opened his Bible and read .

		Afterwards he removed the tobacco from his mouth and laid it on the table and he reported to God with a clean mouth . ''

		The tales and sketches have at least the sound of truth .

		And perhaps it is only our desire to have people live cleanly that makes it so very easy for us to believe that the peasants of these books are nothing more than creatures of the author 's imag - ination .

		THE DIAL A FORTNIGHTLY Labor at the Crossways A N ENGLISHMAN WRITES , '' We can not get the hang over here of your labor movement . ''

		Ap - parently he has been talking with optimistic Ameri - cans and reading our press reports .

		From these he has learned that American labor secured unprece - dented wage returns during the war ; that trade union officials were granted extravagant represen - tation on war boards and state committees ; that a host of labor officials held executive jobs under the government for the administration of the war in - dustries .

		All of this was represented for more than it was worth according to British labor evaluation .

		Union officials of
Great Britain	LOCATION	were also given administrative posts and held positions of influence for purposes of war .

		But these positions and the wage concessions paid British labor were regarded with a characteristic skepticism suggesting the state of mind toward industry of the British worker as it differs from our own .

		The American habit of mind in relation to the industrial institution is not the English ; moreover , our war industrial policy was extraordinary .

		In regard to the latter it will be remembered that when we entered the war we were conscious that we were late for the accomplishment of our avowed part in the conflict .

		If we paid sufficiently , it was argued , we stood the chance of making up for our tardiness .

		As a practical people we decided to pay , to pay any price that would avoid delay .

		The delay that was most feared was short - age in industrial output .

		Immediate steps were taken to insure vested interests against loss , or rather to assure them of ample reward for any cooperation they stood ready to give .

		Assurance was given the unions that workers would be re - warded in wages as never before .

		It was appar - ently accepted that wage payments would not meet
I. W. W.	PERSON	requirements , so the
I. W. W.	PERSON	was jailed .

		But high wage rates could be counted on to settle any difficulties that might arise with the
A. F. of L.	ORGANIZATION	, particularly if union officials were given ample representation on war industry coun - cils .

		The concessions came high , but it made no serious difference what was conceded to labor while the government was the purchaser and business reaped its necessary profits .

		It was not as though the unions wanted to run the industries ; all they asked was '' a voice '' and a fair wage .

		Of course we wondered , while we were still at war and all the concessions were being made , what risks were in store for business when the competi - tive market should take the place of the assured market and bills should be paid no longer by the government .

		As a matter of fact we are won - dering about that now more than ever .

		Before the armistice was signed it seemed so wonderful to have the strong arm of the state offering its pro- tection that to many it was inconceivable that this beneficent power should be withdrawn .

		Now , dumb as usual , we are watching with the helpless - ness of little children the disintegration of the
War Labor Board	ORGANIZATION	, the
War Labor Policies Board	ORGANIZATION	, the failure of the
Department of Labor	ORGANIZATION	to protect the women workers against sudden discharge , discrimi - nation , and cuts in wage rates .

		These agencies I speak of particularly because their failure to survive the first murmur of peace left , with the timid who place their dependence on state machinery , a dis - quieting sense of the futility of government pro- tection in labor affairs .

		Nobody has seemed to know \ yhat to do about it .

		We are at sea : the government , the labor unions , and business .

		Business claimed the right to manage the situation .

		The national legislature was glad to shunt the responsibility , and the na - tional administration blithely threw the problem over to the claimants .

		Since then events have been moving at an unwonted pace .

		The labor market has overflowed .

		The
Federal Employment	ORGANIZATION	offices reaching up and down and across the country are clogged and unable to function as factory doors remain closed and men fail to fit the jobs that offer and the jobs fail to fit the men .

		We are told by the employment managers that the refusal of sol - diers to go back to routine and confinement adds a new element to a situation already on the verge of breaking . '

		In spite of the insistence of the business men that they be allowed to resume their sponsorship over the production of wealth and resume it un - hampered , the Secretary of Labor states that the statistics from the employment bureaus show that the unemployment is due not to any unusual labor surplus , but to the timidity of the business men themselves .

		An industrial manager said to me , '' If you think that labor is without a policy and i66 THE DIAL
February 22	DATE	unequal to the present emergency , I wonder what you would say of the business man if you knew him as well as I do ? ''

		With the price of raw material floating in upper regions , attainable only by government agents because they are unhandicapped as are business agents with the payment of divi - dends ; with Mr.
Gpmpers	PERSON	shouting across the continent that wage fates shall not be reduced what can a sane business man do ?

		He could of course treat with Mr.
Gompers	PERSON	.

		It has always been the boast of the
American Federation	ORGANIZATION	that it can treat with any sane business man .

		But what the business man is now seeing , which causes his discomfort , is not Mr.
Gompers	PERSON	, but that
Specter	ORGANIZATION	which raised its head in
Russia	LOCATION	two years ago , which a little later faced west , crossed
Europe	LOCATION	, and passed into
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		No one can say that this Specter will cross the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		But the fear that obsesses many of the business men is that cuts in the wage rates which were created in war times with the government 's underwriting , might furnish the Specter its incentive for a trial trip .

		It is difficult to tell whether this
Specter	ORGANIZATION	could create havoc of grave importance in
America	LOCATION	, should it make an attempt .

		But it has taken up its abode for the time in
England	LOCATION	, and looks so like a native there that they forget to call it by its Russian name .

		It has made it clear in
Great Britain	LOCATION	that its special mission is not confined to the protection of wage rates but that it is concerned primarily in jacking up labor into the belief that political states and financiers are incompetent to carry industry forward to the satisfaction of the people of any land .

		The most recent reports which have come from
England	LOCATION	,
Scotland	LOCATION	, and
Ireland	LOCATION	show developments which were not defined when Mr.
Cole	PERSON	's article which appears in this issue of THE DIAL was written .

		The strikes are develop - ing unusual significance as they are advancing .

		The latest reports show that the men are ou , t for some - thing quite different from collective bargaining be - tween employer and employed .

		The most favorable settlement terms fail to bring a sense of permanent peace .

		A forty-hour week seems to be no greater accomplishment than a forty-eight .

		There are boilermakers , shipbuilders , and engineers who '' im - pudently '' assert that they are out for the control of industry , that they intend to see that it no longer pays business men to carry on .

		But more signifi - cant is the fact that the strikes represent a rank and file movement ; that the old leaders and or - ganizations are defied ; that the movement in throwing off the old leadership has substituted an organization which has a centralizing power of its own rather than one imposed from above and ex - isting by the weakness of its membership .

		The European movement on the continent and in
Great Britain	LOCATION	is characterized by a decentralization of power and an attempt of the worker to gain status through control and self-government , in his organi - zations as well as in the workshop .

		The intention of the American unions , to form a national political party expresses a new desire for the extension of political control rather any new sense of industrial sovereignty .

		It will be said that the intention is to develop both .

		But I can find noth - ing in the platforms as they were issued which shows desire for change in industrial status , or in - terest of the unions in the extension of labor con - trol .

		The platforms of the
Chicago	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	trade unions , it is true , as well as a recent manifesto of the
American Federation	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- declaring against a political party -RRB- are all opposed to the ex - tension of privilege to corporations .

		They all stand for a tax on land values , but they stand for a tax as well on inheritance and incomes .

		In other words , they have no conception of clearing industry of legal handicaps so that it could be pursued and developed ; they are not concerned , indeed , with its development .

		They leave development and control , as a matter of fact , to others to any others , to the business men or to the state .

		There is the tacit assumption throughout that labor has no interest in the running of industry .

		The American wage earner , the American stockholder , financial manipu - lator , and employer of labor are alike concerned with the possession of goods .

		That is what these labor platforms are about and that is what the manifesto of the Executive Council of the
A. F. of L.	ORGANIZATION	is about .

		They demand the right of organi - sation to maintain wage rates .

		There is no sug - gestion that these organizations shall represent industrial self-government in the sense in which they use that term in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The
Chicago	LOCATION	plat - form and the
New York	LOCATION	platform call for a demo - cratic control of industry , but no further reading of the platforms suggests that democratic control means more than the higgling which the unions have heretofore carried on with employers the jug - gling with a wage which was followed by a more skilful juggling with a market .

		The Federation and these new labor parties in the states are relying on the government to regu - late industry as they lay stress on a proportionate representation of labor in government administra - tive and legislative bodies .

		Such political represen - tation might well .

		follow an organization of indus - try where self-government had been effected or where labor had assumed responsibility and status in the work of wealth production .

		But preceding labor 's industrial control and responsibility , political representation , as it is demanded in these platforms .

		1919 THE DIAL 167 means labor 's administration of industry through politics .

		Conceive for a moment the realization of this demand for political representation .

		The legislatures and government offices would be domi - nated by labor .

		Under such circumstances labor would block the movements of those who controlled wealth wherever such action appeared to serve the purposes of the trade unions .

		The situation , as we know , is inconceivable , and it is further to be con - sidered what can be gained by a policy which de - pends on blocking ?

		Is not this effort of labor to gain a strategic position through the state only another move in a defensive policy ?

		Does it not indicate that labor is admitting weakness , is side - stepping the extension of its function from its position of routine and employment to participa - tion in the management and control of wealth pro- duction ?

		So far as these recent pronouncements of organized labor indicate , the union position is un - changed .

		Labor is to be bought and sold in the market as usual .

		No reiteration of the
American Federation	ORGANIZATION	that labor is not a commodity can be seriously regarded while the union movement leaves the workers without status in their industry , or control in the development of the enterprise of which they are an integral part .

		We have believed in our industrial institution because we were confident that our resources were unlimited , that wealth was to be had , and that sooner or later it would come our individual way .

		The chances were good if we could only get next to some one in power .

		What could a union move - ment do against such a cheering thought ?

		This temper is unintelligible to our English friends : it it because of it that they can not understand our movement or realize why it is hung up .

		It is hung up , but no one will predict for how long .

		With the government leaving industry to business men , and business men coming back for protection to the government ; with a desperate cutting in wage rates in some-of the industries in spite of what may hap - pen later ; with production blocked in other indus - tries ; and with food , clothing , and shelter maintain - ing their purchase price , will the American labor movement come down to the business in hand ?

		Will it remain sublimely unconscious that such a thing as labor control of production is being born into the world ?

		Today , for the first time , organized labor has given a sign that it is conscious .

		Up to the present moment there was no public evidence that 2,000,000 organized workers in the
United States	LOCATION	would pro- pose in regular form to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	that the railroad workers of the country should take over the entire operating control and financial management of the roads .

		There is no precedent in trade union prac - tice for such an astounding proposition .

		There is no tradition among the wage workers in
America	LOCATION	, such as still lurks in the minds of the British , of in - dustrial responsibility .

		Our American unions have not been discussing labor status as the English have .

		On the contrary they have displayed a marked aver - sion to the idea of industrial management or con - trol .

		Even these same railroad workers , it is ru - mored , turned down a short time ago a tentative invitation to participate in the administration of the roads when the government took them over while we were at war .

		Today with cool confidence they make a proposition which might have sprung from any corporation that was properly endowed with its usual quota of common , preferred , and watered stock .

		In making their proposition they remark , or their attorney does for them , that operating ability is the sole capital of this corporation .

		Has any greater heresy than this been spoken in
Russia	LOCATION	?

		The proposition wears indeed the same air of '' impudence '' which was objected to in
England	LOCATION	.

		But the animus is not the English nor the Russian .

		It is not impudent and is not impelled by any revo - lutionary thoughts or intention .

		Specifically it is a defensive move against the federal regulation which denies government employees the full right of organi - zation .

		Although the proposition , may be no more than a matter of trade-union strategy , as it comes at this time when the industrial and labor situa - tion is highly sensitive to suggestion , it can not fail to mark a new era in labor psychology .

		What will be said in the next few weeks on the question of acceptance or rejection of the proposal must in - evitably leave an indelible impression on the future if not on the present policy of the labor movement .

		In the first place the proposal involves a com - plete shift from craft to industrial unionism .

		It is implicit in the very statement of the proposition that industrial organization is the prerequisite of mastery and control , for the very simple reason that it is the basis of actual industrial operation .

		What - ever disposition is made of the scheme , the 500,000 members of the
Railroad Brotherhood	ORGANIZATION	and the 1,500,000 members of the
A. F. of L.	ORGANIZATION	craft unions which are involved in the proposal will all recog - nize that any suggestion which insures a cha ` nge of status for labor or places it in a position of control will require this shift from craft to industrial or - ganization .

		For the advancement of industrial unionism the event could not have been more timely .

		During the war the development of efficiency methods in the factory reduced many of the so - called skilled processes to mechanical operations which would fit the strength and experience i68 THE DIAL
February 22	DATE	women and young people .

		This dilution of skill and of male labor has its serious , direct , and obvious con - sequences for the craft unions .

		One of the most important effects of industrial unionism is the compulsion which it imposes on labor to think in terms of the enterprise rather than the job .

		On the other hand , industrial union - ism does not , as is often supposed , insure industrial democracy or give of necessity opportunity for self - government .

		In respect to the latter this scheme of the
Railroad Unions	ORGANIZATION	furnishes a striking contrast to the English movement of the shops , which is also industrial in its direction .

		It is not the industrial form of organization of the shop stewards move - ment which gives it its democratic character ; it is , the desire of the shop workers to participate in in - dustrial management .

		The existence of this desire in
England	LOCATION	and its absence in
America	LOCATION	is a pertinent illustration of the differences which exist in trade union psychology .

		The division of labor and the successful competition of machine production with hand production , of the factory with the workshop or the craftsman , never destroyed completely the British tradition that bound the workman to his in - dustry .

		This tradition which has persisted for nearly two centuries without apparent warrant or value has made its contribution at last in the swift development of labor organization which is deter - mined by the men at work in the shops .

		Even should this shop steward movement end without complete victory over the unionism which is super - imposed , this habit of mind of the British worker toward industrial responsibility is a labor asset with which the vested interests of
Great Britain	LOCATION	will eventually reckon .

		Because modern industry has made little im - pression in
Russia	LOCATION	, the Russian workers as a whole have never experienced an industrial environment which is as irresponsible as is our own for pro- duction .

		Producing wealth in
Russia	LOCATION	has always been a matter for serious concern , and the brunt of the concern as well as the labor was borne by the peasant .

		It is not difficult to trace the idea of in - dustrial self-government for which the Soviet stands to the old Zemstvos and to understand that the Russian workers are better prepared for the assumption of industrial responsibility than the workers of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		It is important to remember in estimating the elements which have given the workers of
Russia	LOCATION	and
Great Britain	LOCATION	their impetus for industrial democracy that in both of these countries the workers ' cooperative enterprises have persisted with the strong tendency to pre - serve the idea of responsibility for productive en - terprise which had rested with workers before the days of business enterprise .

		The attitude of American labor toward produc - tion is the national attitude of giving as little and taking as much as we can get away with .

		This attitude is common enough in modern
Europe	LOCATION	but in
America	LOCATION	it is without inhibitions sufficiently im - portant to have had their effect , either conscious , or unconscious , on industrial responsibility .

		I have not space to speak of the part this attitude may play in the revolutionary changes which are apparently scheduled to come off sooner or later on this side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		But '' as industry is reorganizing for the benefit of financial interests it has become apparent that the interest of labor and its sense of industrial responsibility must be aroused if American industry is to hold its own in the world market .

		There is no known way of developing responsibility except by experiencing it , and this proposal of the railroad workers is the first sugges - tion that the unions may seriously regard them - selves as responsible factors .

		While this proposal is not as yet representative of current thought in labor organizations , it will be received there as a highly agitating event and one with which the in - terests in some connection will have to deal .

		Today the situation is this : the officials of unions represent - ing 2,000,000 wage workers have broken down all precedent as they have proposed in serious form to take over the management of the railroad sys - tems of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Here is adventure and imaginative matter injected at a time when sug - gestion counts .

Arthur James Balfour	PERSON	: Selections from his Non-political Writings , Speeches and Ad - dresses , 1879-1917 -LRB- edited by
Wilfred M. Short Doran	PERSON	;
$ 2.50	MONEY	-RRB- is a challenge to consider Mr.
Bal	PERSON	- four apart from his political record : as a thinker , a spirit , a personality .

		The two aspects of the man are not altogether separable .

		If the tradition of his class had not forced the languid and philosophic youth into public life , his literary record would not have forced THE DIAL and me to destroy white paper talking about him .

		He is a fascinating creature , of a fascinating entourage , but his indi - vidual importance for history lies in his policy of force and the British style of reform in
Ireland	LOCATION	in those long years when he led either the Government or the opposition and in his success as a diplomat in the greatest of wars .

		As his uncle believed in him , he was put in
Parliament	LOCATION	at twenty-six ;
five years later	DATE	he made himself famous by applying to
Ireland	LOCATION	coercion plus sensible concrete proposals as seen by a mind bred across the Channel ; and at forty-four he was prime minister .

		Nobody claims for him a constructive legislative record in his three most conspicuous subjects ,
Ireland	LOCATION	, education , and tariff , he solved nothing but the
House of Com	ORGANIZATION	- mons , which knows so much about
England	LOCATION	's prog - ress , through many years loved and followed him .

		England always has her men of action her
Rhodes	LOCATION	,
Gladstone	LOCATION	,
Chamberlain	PERSON	; she has a quiet and pre - vailing instinct for getting things done ; but her governing class also love a measured manner and calm indifference to political prizes .

		Sir
Edward Grey	PERSON	's known preference for fishing over public life , the
Duke of Devonshire	ORGANIZATION	's devotion to country occu - pations , Lord
Salisbury	PERSON	's indifference , fitted the taste of an assembly of gentlemen long accustomed to rule .

		Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	's manner , his love of philoso - phy , his rapier-like debating , his personal charm , and his courage reached the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	, as they will reach some who merely read his written words .

		A
Briton	ORGANIZATION	will pass final judgment on some - one by saying he is the sort of man with whom one would like to go tiger-hunting .

		He is picturing character in an emergency , when it would stand surely to its undertaking .

		Nobody ever doubted Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	's character .

		This firmness is not to be exploited .

		Even tragedy is questionable .

		A perfect type of the Brit - ish aristocrat has a kind of unobtrusive preference for the agreeable . ''

		I personally like the
Spring	DATE	day , '' Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	says , in responding to a toast to literature , '' and bright sun and the birds singing , and if there be a shower or a storm , it should be merely a passing episode in the landscape , to be fol - lowed immediately by a return of brilliant sun - shine . ''

		It is not the
Lear	PERSON	or Oedipus type .

		I know not how true it is , but there used to be a statement current , about the time Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	was coming into prominence , that the most quoted book in the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	was Alice in
Wonderland	LOCATION	, and surely there is no book that appeals more unques - tionably to a high and rather late culture .

		The fact that the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	liked it so much is not unrelated to their love of Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	, to whom human reasoning appears much as a grotesque .

		This type of mind has made him more formidable in destructive criticism than in positive propaganda or enactment , and it is fit that his most notable piece of writing should be entitled * A
Defense of Philo	ORGANIZATION	- sophic Doubt .

		It is an entirely successful defense of philosophic doubt .

		It is not so conclusive a foundation for the doctrines of the established church , or for any other affirmation , nor is its suc - cessor , The Foundations of Belief .

		The ability ex - hibited in these volumes is forensic .

		The misty notions of evidence harbored by the unskilled have small chance against the writer ; and his favorite target is the cruder skepticism : Suppose for a moment a community of which each member should deliberately set himself the task of throw - ing off as far as possible all prejudices due to education ; where each should consider it his duty critically to ex - amine the grounds upon which rest every positive enact - ment and every moral precept which he has been accus - tomed to obey ; to dissect all the great loyalties which make social life possible , and all the minor conventions which help to make it easy ; and to weigh out with scrupulous precision the exact degree of assent which in e ~ ach particular case the results of this process might seem '' to justify .

		To say that such a community , if it acted upon the opinions thus arrived at , would stand but a poor chance in the struggle for existence is to say far too little .

		It could never even begin to be ; and if by a miracle it was created , it would without doubt imme - diately resolve itself into its constituent elements .

		Hence we take our stand for Authority : It is true , no doubt , that we can , without any great expenditure of research , accumulate instances in which
Authority	ORGANIZATION	has perpetuated error and retarded progress , for unluckily none of the influences , Reason least 1 of all , by which the history of the race has been moulded , have been productive of unmixed good . ''

		Least of all , '' Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	?

		And again : if we would find the quality in which we most notably excel the brute creation , we should look for it , not so much in our faculty of convincing and being convinced by the exercise of reasoning , as in our capacity for in - fluencing and being influenced through the action of Authority .

		Note the capital A .

		But this preference really fails at a glance .

		Our young chickens reproduce the 170 THE DIAL
February 22	DATE	habits and conclusions of their ancestors .

		On the Other hand , reasoning , and reasoning against the cur - rent , guided
Galileo	ORGANIZATION	,
Darwin	PERSON	,
Socrates	LOCATION	, and Jesus .

		Also if man has passed into a world unknown to apes , it is because he was able to reach a conclu - sion that if he put wood on fire he could maintain himself in warmth .

		By the heterodox has he gone forward .

		No doubt the first ape to walk on his hind legs was deemed an opponent of Authority and a Danger to the
Community	ORGANIZATION	.

		I would not willingly be frivolous .

		The Tory tradition has a role of value in the world , and it will have value in the new world that we approach .

		Even we democrats should welcome an intelligent questioning of democracy .

		There will be a new Tory party , whatever it may be called .

		The public is the right judge of public affairs , but the public is compelled to experiment , and it is subject to at - tacks of caprice , fashion , and mob despotism .

		The future will do something strange to
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and
Cambridge	LOCATION	, Heaven knows what ; languid , critical charm will not mark the prime minister of
2019	DATE	; but there will be other
Cambridges	LOCATION	, other
Balfours	LOCATION	, questioning the new , calm with the memory of cen - turies , guided -LRB- and limited -RRB- by taste .

		To that new Toryism let us hope that some of our best men and women may adhere . ''

		Democracy is one of the most difficult forms of government to administer , though it be the greatest . ''

		Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	was talking to Americans when he said that , in
1911	DATE	, and he warned them that the problems of democracy are not simple ; are not going to solve themselves ; re - quire the services of the best men ; are of increasing difficulty ; and indeed , '' while the word progress is perpetually on our lips , we may yet be face to face with a danger and difficulty of % vhich the solution may escape even the wisest . ''

		The Tory was a person with a privilege to which was attached an obligation .

		He is not to be classed with the Bourbons .

		He recognized his obligations more than his successor in power , the captain of in - dustry ; and indeed the best of the Tories are lining themselves up with those who would shake the hold of finance .

		Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	said some years ago , and his cousin , Lord
Robert Cecil	PERSON	, has said within a few weeks , that the hope of civilization lies in actual partnership between capital and labor , not in minor concessions .

		Yet Lord
Robert	PERSON	re - signed from the Government on the issue of Welsh disestablishment , and Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	fights modern education in behalf of the established church .

		The Tory is an extraordinarily worthy and interesting tnimal .

		Moriturum te salutamus .

		Your day is passing , but we give you our applause .

		The British aristocrat , whether Tory or Whig , has known singularly well how to fit himself to ad - vancing circumstance .

		If the Bourbon forgot nothing and learned nothing , the .

		British aristocracy renews itself with men of mark and respects in its own ranks not the wasters and the drones but the industrious and responsible .

		To a near relative of Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	's I once said , '' The British populace has taken over political power just about in propor - tion as it - has needed it , '' and she replied , '' We have given it to them . ''

		The '' we '' was a trifle proud , perhaps , but it is true that one of the greatest ac - complishments of the ruling class in
England	LOCATION	has been in knowing when to yield .

		It has never sat on the lid until it was blown up .

		Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	is over seventy today , and his ideas are more liberal than they were when he was twenty .

		Perhaps if the German aristocracy had been as sound in instinct as the British , the world-war would have had another ending , or there would have been no war .

		The Briton can tell pretty well the substance from the shadow .

		If he had been in power in
Germany	LOCATION	, and had seen his country rapidly conquering the mar - kets of the world , he would never have given up such solid conquest for a dazzling grandiose idea .

		No shining armor or terrifying noises for him .

		He finds out what is essential and quietly makes it his .

		In the growth of the mighty empire the liberal and the conservative forces have kept so close together that their differences have amounted to supplement .

		It is even true that a large part of the progressive legislation has been enacted by the Tories .

		As I look back at Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	's record , even at such parts of it as
Ireland	LOCATION	, I hesitate to dogmatize .

		He is always intelligent ; perhaps he might admit that the more characteristic doctrines of Jesus have not shown conspicuously in his politics .

		This may be for him or against him , for all I know .

		The Brit - ish Empire is a big place .

		It might have been smaller if only democratically and spiritually minded men had formed its governments .

		It certainly would have been smaller if stern men had ruled alone , for in that case
South Africa	LOCATION	would have joined
Germany	LOCATION	in this war , with what remoter consequences we know not .

		Possibly the combina - tion of compulsion and freedom , of idealism and business , of skepticism and hope , that the British elector has stood for represents as sound political government as there is .

		However , in insisting on Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	's essential Toryism , we must emphasize also the superiority of his individual intelligence .

		Why did he cease to be the leader of his party ?

		Why were the letters , B.M.G. , ''
Balfour	PERSON	Must Go , '' posted over Lon - don ?

		Who succeeded him ?

		He lost his leadership , in the fight of a decade ago , over the
House	ORGANIZATION	of
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 171 Lords because he was not sufficiently rigid and nar - row-minded to meet the spirit of the unbending Tories .

		It was the Bitter-Enders , in the
House of Lords	ORGANIZATION	contest , who threw Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	out .

		Since those days the leader of the Unionists has been an industrious and mediocre business man , with no troublesome individuality , and apparently Mr. An - drew Bonar Law managed his task , before the world war and since , to the satisfaction of those immediately concerned .

		Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	's reputation seemed to have started on the decline until in the war he emerged as the man most trusted in foreign diplomacy not for imagination , for conceiving or embracing a startling future , but for tact , negoti - ating ability , forensic shrewdness , and judgment .

		The acts of leadership and faith in this greatest of all crises are not what we expect of him ; but if these acts give promise it will not be in Mr. ,
Balfour	LOCATION	to oppose .

		If mankind masters itself , to settle in a better way the problems that arise between states ; if
Germany	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	are made welcome partners ; if the method of governing this new assembly is well advanced in liberalism ; and if all countries , includ - ing
Britain	LOCATION	, are asked to make sacrifices for a suc - cess so high facing such a world Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	will at least acquiesce .

		Afterward he will go back to
England	LOCATION	, happy to spend the evening of life with books and simple exercise , but ready whenever needed to enter the ranks , and not afraid to contem - plate any new world that the wisdom or folly of man may choose .

		A
Balfour	PERSON	is not a

		X r
TT NORMAN HAPGOOD	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
Industrial Councils of Great Britain R	ORGANIZATION	, .

		EADERS WHOSE knowledge of the industrial situation in
Great Britain	LOCATION	is confined to the speeches of Cabinet Ministers and the comments of the daily press are apt to imagine that a new heaven and a new earth are being created by some magical process initiated by the Whitley Report .

		Joint Standing Industrial Councils representing employers and employed , so the press and the politicians in - form us , are being set up almost every day , and a new spirit of fellowship and good will is animating masters and workmen alike .

		I can only say that I have sought for this new spirit , and I have not found it .

		Joint Standing Industrial Councils are indeed being established in considerable numbers ; but most of the vital industries have hitherto shown no anxiety to establish them , and , even where they have been established , there is not much evidence of the '' new spirit '' of which we hear so much .

		In fact , the
Whitley Report	ORGANIZATION	, loudly as it has been ac - claimed in governmental circles , has almost entirely failed to stir the world of Labor .

		In some indus - tries , notably on the railways and in the big engi - neering group , it has been definitely rejected .

		In other cases it has been accepted as a useful piece of machinery , but without any particular enthusiasm , and certainly with no idea that it provides a panacea for all industrial troubles .

		The only case in which its adoption has been urgently pressed by the workers is that of
State	ORGANIZATION	employees , and in this instance the urgency arises largely from the desire to use it as a means of securing full recognition and the right of collective bargaining .

		The first Whitley Report , to which the later Re - ports are hardly more than supplements , proposes that in the better organized industries Standing Joint Industrial Councils should be set up nationally in each industry , with
District Councils and Works Councils	ORGANIZATION	under them .

		The
National and District Councils	ORGANIZATION	are to consist of an equal representation from Employers ' Associations on the one side and from Trade Unions on the other .

		They are to be voluntary in character , and the Endowing of their decisions with any legal power is to be a matter for further consideration .

		The
State	ORGANIZATION	is not to be repre - sented , and is to appoint a chairman only when re - quested to do so by the
Council	ORGANIZATION	itself .

		At the same time the
Government	ORGANIZATION	has announced its intention of recognizing the Councils as advisory bodies repre - senting the various industries , and of consulting them on matters affecting their interests .

		In all this there is nothing in the smallest degree revolutionary .

		In most industries in
Great Britain	LOCATION	there have long existed regular means of joint nego - tiation and consultation between employers and em - ployed .

		In some cases these have taken the form of
Boards of Conciliation	ORGANIZATION	with agreed rules and methods of procedure ; in others there have been merely regular arrangements for periodic confer - ence .

		The important point is that , in the majority of organized industries , recognition of
Trade Union	ORGANIZATION	- ism and frequent negotiation between Trade Unions and Employers ' Associations have long been the rule .

		The Whitley Report does not in reality carry matters very much further , though at first sight it may seem to do so .

		It hints again and again that one of its principal reasons for urging the establish - ment of
Joint Industrial Councils	ORGANIZATION	is in order to 172 THE DIAL
February 22	DATE	satisfy the demand of the workers for a greater con - trol over industry ; but the actual constitutions of the
Whitley Councils	ORGANIZATION	which have been established do nothing at all to make this aspiration a fact .

		They provide , ' indeed , for joint consideration of questions affecting the industry ; but they do nothing to affect the final and exclusive control of the em - ployer over the way in which he runs his business .

		I am not complaining , or saying that they could do more .

		I am merely criticizing the prevalent view that the Whitley Report makes a new and revolu - tionary departure in the sphere of industrial rela - tions .

		It does not : - it only regularizes and formal - ises a process which has long been going on in most of our principal industries , and one which would have continued whether there had been a Whitley Report or not .

		In fact , the control of industry can - not be altered merely by the setting up of a few
Joint Committees	ORGANIZATION	.

		The control of industry rests on the economic power of those who control it ; and only a shifting of the balance of economic power will alter this control .

		Such a shifting of power may be , and I believe is , in progress at the present time ; but it is quite independent of such events as the issuing and adoption by the Government of the Whitley Report .

		The view most current among Trade Unionists that the Whitley Report does not matter much one way or the other is certainly the right one .

		Nevertheless , though it is not likely to produce large permanent results , the Report has for the time being attracted a good deal of attention .

		Official Trade Unionism , represented by the
Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress	ORGANIZATION	, accepted it without enthusiasm and subject to its remaining purely voluntary .

		Even official Trade Unionism will not tolerate compulsory arbitration in any form , except under protest as a war measure .

		Unofficial rank and file Trade Unionism , represented by the shop stewards ' movement and other agencies , roundly denounced '' Whitleyism '' as an attempt to sidetrack the growing movement of the class-con - scious workers towards the control of industry . ''

		Whitleying away our strength , '' one rank and file critic entitled his article upon the Report , and went on to urge that the capitalists , fearing the rising tide of rank and file committees , had inspired the Report in the hope of substituting for them joint committees of masters and men , and so depriving them of their dynamic and revolutionary character .

		The
National Guilds League	ORGANIZATION	, also representing the left wing , declared against the underlying assump - tion of the Report that industrial peace is possible and desirable under capitalism , and pointed out that , whatever the merits or demerits of joint committees , they can not provide the dynamic for securing con - trol , or offer any alternative to workship agitation and workshop organization for the purpose of a gradual assumption of control by the workers .

		Other critics , largely among State Socialists , dwelt rather on the dangers of Whitleyism to the con - sumer and the risk of establishing a common soli - darity between employers and workers in a particu - lar industry against the public a risk also noted by the Guild Socialists .

		In fact , everywhere the left wing , and often a part of the right also , rejected the
Whitley	PERSON	proposals .

		What , then , of the
Whitley Councils	ORGANIZATION	and other bodies on similar lines , which are being established ?

		The first thing to notice about them is that many of them affect only small and often ill-organized groups .

		The
Whitley Committee	ORGANIZATION	itself recom - mended the establishment of Joint Industrial Coun - cils only in those industries in which employers and employed were comparatively well organized .

		For the industries in which organization was weak , it recommended the establishment of Trade Boards under the act recently passed to extend the scope of the original Trade Boards Act of
1909	DATE	.

		Never - ' theless ,
Whitley	PERSON	Councils have been established in a number of industries which can not by any means be regarded as well organized .

		Instances of this are
the Pottery Council	ORGANIZATION	and the
Match Makers ' Council	ORGANIZATION	.

		Moreover , Councils are being set up for certain small sectional trades which can hardly by any stretch of imagination be regarded as industries .

		The
Bobbin Industrial Council	ORGANIZATION	and the Spelter In - dustrial
Council	ORGANIZATION	are notable examples of this undue tendency to sectional organization .

		On the other hand , Councils have been or are being set up in a number of important industries , including the woolen , printing , building , baking , and other in - dustries .

		In addition to the Industrial Councils set up under the Whitley scheme , the
Government	ORGANIZATION	, through the
Ministry of Reconstruction	ORGANIZATION	, has estab - lished a number of Interim Reconstruction Com - mittees , principally in industries in which the for - mation of Industrial Councils has not been found possible , but also in some cases for small or almost unorganized industrial groups , such as needles and fishhooks , and furniture removing and warehous - ing .

		Altogether there are about twenty Indus - trial Councils now in existence , and a considerably larger number of Interim Reconstruction Commit - tees .

		No steps have yet been taken to extend the Trade Boards Act to new trades , unless not very definite promises to distributive workers , to tobacco workers , and to one or two other groups are treated as steps in this direction .

		It is too early yet to say what the new Indus - trial Councils are likely to do when they get to
1919	DATE	THE DIAL work .

		Their constitutions are , as a rule , drawn so as to embrace a large variety of purposes , without giving much indication of the course which they will actually pursue .

		One significant clause , which oc - curs in the constitution of several Councils , makes it one of the objects to maintain selling prices at a level which will secure reasonable remuneration to both employers and employees .

		This recalls the professed objects of many trusts and employers ' com - binations too closely to require detailed criticism ; but it is important to note it because it is clearly based on the assumption of a common interest be - tween employers and workers in a particular indus - try a common interest which clearly may easily become anti-social in its effects , and in any case runs counter to the Socialist theory of a common soli - darity of all workers irrespective of craft or indus - try .

		Apart from this provision the constitutions contain few notable features , except that in many cases the provision for District Councils and , still more , for
Works Committees	ORGANIZATION	is allowed to fall very much into the background .

		All the constitutions provide for regular discussion on matters affecting the industry , and for communication with the au - thorities on questions of legislation affecting the in - dustry ; but it is too soon to see how this consulta - tion will work in practice .

		Apart from the
Whitley Councils	ORGANIZATION	, there are a riumber of agencies at work with the declared object of promoting industrial peace .

		The Industrial Re - construction Council exists mainly in order to push the ideas of the Whitley Report , and sometimes seems to acquire in the process an almost official status .

		The so-called '' Reconstruction Society '' is merely the old
Anti-Socialist Union	ORGANIZATION	suitably dis - guised .

		The
National Alliance of Employers	ORGANIZATION	and Employed is , directly or indirectly , an offshoot of the big employers ' Federation of British Industries , and includes many prominent employers and a few well-known Trade Unionists of the right wing , among them Mr.
Havelock Wilson	PERSON	and Mr.
John Hodge	PERSON	.

		This body has so far devoted itself mainly to the question of demobilization , urging that the re - construction of industry should be undertaken co - operatively by employers and Trade Unions with the minimum of
Government	ORGANIZATION	interference .

		The
Industrial League	ORGANIZATION	is a less formal prqpagandist body with much the same obj ` ects as the
National Alli	ORGANIZATION	- ance .

		None of these bodies has secured much
Trade Union	ORGANIZATION	backing , except among the Labor leaders of the extreme right wing .

		In fact all these move - ments for industrial cooperation are of little effect in relation to the really vital problems of industrial reconstruction .

		Whatever joint machinery may be set up , it seems unlikely that the gulf between em - ployers and workers will be in any way bridged .

		In almost every industry of importance the workers are already busy formulating extensive programs , em - bodying demands which will hardly be granted with - out a struggle .

		The railwaymen have already put forward their National Program , which includes not only the eight-hour day and heavy demands for wage increases , but also a definite claim for an equal share in the control of the railway service .

		The promise of the '' eight-hour day , already given by the
Government	ORGANIZATION	, has staved off the crisis for the mo - ment but has done nothing really to solve the prob - lem .

		The engineering and shipyard trades , which have just received the forty-seven hour week , have an extensive list of further demands in preparation .

		The miners in most of the coalfields are already put - ting forward comprehensive programs .

		The cotton workers have just come through a wage crisis , and are about to put forward a claim for a substantial reduction in hours .

		The transport workers are formulating a series of national demands for the various sections of their membership .

		Nor is the position in these industries peculiar .

		Almost every group of workers has a long list of grievances and demands which have been perforce laid aside during the war , and all these may be expected to emerge during the next few months .

		The existence of
Whitley Councils or Reconstruction Committees	ORGANIZATION	will do nothing to alter the character of the eco - nomic conflict which seems to be impending .

		I do not mean , of course , that the British workers are class-conscious revolutionaries aiming definitely at the overthrow of the existing industrial order .

		Nor do I mean that all , or even the majority , of the demands which they are making will result in strikes .

		Most of them will probably be settled by negotiation , unless a general upheaval occurs .

		This however is nothing new .

		The strike has never been more than an occasional weapon , and the fact that a dispute is settled without a stoppage does not alter the fact that the terms of settlement usually depend on the relative economic strength of the parties .

		My point is that all the talk about industrial peace and all the action in setting up new machinery will be found to have made very little difference when it is actually put to the test .

		Employers and workers will continue to differ about their relative status in industry and about their respective shares - of its fruits ; and they will continue to settle their differ - ences mainly by the balancing of economic forces , whether the balancing is done by negotiation or by the open force of strike or lock-out .

		In fact the tendency is to attach far too much importance to joint machinery such as that which is recommended in the
Whitley	LOCATION	Reports , and to forget that no amount of machinery can alter the essential facts of the economic situation .

		_ THE DIAL
February 22	DATE	Bolshevism Is a Menace to Whom ?

		HEN TAKEN at its face value and trans - lated into its nearest English equivalent '' bol - shevism '' means '' majority rule . ''

		Another equivalent would be '' popular government , '' and still another , '' democracy '' although the latter two terms are not so close a translation as the former , particularly not as '' democracy '' is under - stood in
America	LOCATION	.

		In American usage '' democracy '' denotes a par - ticular form of political organization , without ref - erence to the underlying economic organization ; whereas '' bolshevism '' has primarily no political signification , being a form of economic organiza - tion , with incidental consequences mostly nega - tive in the field of politics .

		But in the case of any word that gets tangled up in controversial argument and so becomes a storm-center of ugly sentiments , its etymology is no safe guide to the meaning which the word has in the mind of those who shout it abroad in the heat of applause or of denunciation .

		By immediate derivation , as it is now used to designate that revolutionary faction which rules the main remnants of the Russian empire , '' Bol - sheviki '' signifies that particular wing of the Rus - sian Socialists which was in a majority on a test vote at a congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Party in
1903	DATE	; since which time the name has at - tached to that particular faction .

		It happens that the wing of the Social-Democratic Party which so came in for this name at that time was the left wing , the out-and-outers of the Socialist profes - sion .

		And these are they to whom it has fallen today to carry the burden of humanity 's dearest hopes or fears , according as one may be inclined to see it .

		Beyond the Russian frontiers the name has been carried over to designate the out-and-outers elsewhere , wherever they offer to break bounds and set aside the underlying principles of the established order , economic and political .

		Bolshevism is a menace .

		No thoughtful person today is free to doubt that , whether he takes sides for or against according as his past habitua - tion and his present circumstances may dictate .

		In - deed it would even be the same for any reasonably intelligent person who might conceivably be stand - ing footloose in the middle , as a disinterested by - stander possessed of that amiably ineffectual gift , a perfectly balanced mind .

		He would still have to admit the fact that Bolshevism is a menace .

		Only that , in the absence of partisan heat , he would also be faced with the question : A menace to whom ?

		Bolshevism is revolutionary .

		It aims to carry democracy and majority rule over into the domain of industry .

		Therefore it is a menace to the estab - lished order and to those persons whose fortunes are bound up with the established order .

		It is charged with being a menace to private property , to business , to industry , to state and church , to law and morals , to the world 's peace , to civilization , and to mankind at large .

		And it might prove sufficient - ly difficult for any person with a balanced mind to clear the Bolshevist movement of any one or all of these charges .

		In point of its theoretical aims and its profes - sions , as regards its underlying principles of equity and reconstruction , this movement can presumably make out about as good and wholesome a case as any other revolutionary movement .

		But in point of practical fact , as regards the effectual working-out of its aims and policies under existing conditions , the evidence which has yet come to hand , it must be admitted , is evidence of a trail of strife , priva - tion , and bloodshed , more or less broad but in any case plain to be seen .

		No doubt the available evidence of this working - out of Bolshevism in the Russian lands is to be taken with a much larger allowance than anything that could be called '' a grain of salt '' ; no doubt much of it is biased testimony , and no doubt much of the rest is maliciously false .

		But when all is said in abatement there still remains the trail of dis - order , strife , privation , and bloodshed , plain to be `` seen .

		How much of all this disastrous run of horror and distress is to be set down to the account of Bolshevism , simply in its own right , and how much to the tactics of the old order and its defenders , or how the burden of blame is fairly to be shared between them all that is not so plain .

		Bolshevism is a revolutionary movement , and as such it has necessarily met with forcible opposition , and in the nature of things it is bound to meet op - position , more or less stubborn and with more or less unhappy consequences .

		Any subversive project such as Bolshevism can be carried through only by overcoming resistance , which means an appeal to force .

		The Russian democratic revolution of the
spring of 1917	DATE	was a political and military revolution which involved a number of economic readjust - ments .

		The merits of that move are not in ques - tion here .

		In the present connection it is chieflj significant as having prepared the ground for the
1919	DATE	THE DIAL later revolution of
November 1917	DATE	out of which the rule of the Soviets and the Bolshevik dictator - ship have grown .

		This latter is an economic revo - lution in intention and in its main effect , although it involves also certain political undertakings and adjustments .

		Its political and military undertakings and policies are , a ' t least in theory , wholly provi - sional and subsidiary to its economic program .

		Any slight attention to the Declaration of Rights and the provisions of the Constitution , promulgated by the All-Russian Convention of Soviets last
July	DATE	, will make that clear .

		The political and military meas - ures decided on have been taken with a view singly to carrying out a policy of economic changes .

		This economic policy is frankly subversive of the existing system of property rights and business enterprise , in - cluding , at least provisionally , repudiation of the Russian imperial obligations incurred by the
Czar 's Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		These documents of the
Soviet Republic	LOCATION	, together with later action taken in pursuance of the policies there outlined , give a summary answer to the ques - tion : A menace to whom ?

		The documents in the case draw an unambiguous line of division between the vested interests and the common man ; and the Bolshevist program foots up to a simple and com - prehensive disallowance of all vested rights .

		That is substantially all that is aimed at ; but the sequel of that high resolve , as it is now running its course , goes to say that that much is also more than a suffi - cient beginning of trouble .

		In its first intention , and in the pursuit of its own aim , therefore , in so far as this pursuit has not been hindered by interested parties , this Bolshevism is a menace to the vested in - terests , and to nothing and no one else .

		All of which is putting as favorable a construc - tion on the professions and conduct of the Bolshe - viki as may be ; and it is all to be taken as a de - scription of the main purpose of the movement , not as an account of the past year 's turmoil in
Bolshe	LOCATION	- vist
Russia	LOCATION	.

		But it is as well to keep in mind that the original substance and cause of this Bolshevist trouble is a cleavage and antagonism between the vested interests and the common man , and that the whole quarrel turns finally about the vested rights of property and privilege .

		The moderate liberals , such as the Cadets , and in its degree the Kerensky administration , are made up of those persons who are ready to disallow the vested rights of privilege , but who will not consent to the disallowance of the vested rights of ownershop .

		And it is at this point that the European powers come into the case .

		These democratic or quasi - democratic powers and their democratic or pseudo - democratic statesmen are not so greatly concerned , though regretful , about the disallowance of class privileges and perquisites in
Russia	LOCATION	.

		Of course , it is disquieting enough , and the European statesmen of the status quo ante , to whom European affairs have been entrusted , will necessarily look with some dis - taste and suspicion on the discontinuance of class privilege and class rule in the dominions of the late Czar ; all that sort of thing is disquieting to the system of vested rights within which these
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean statesmen live and move .

		But privilege simply as such is after all in the nature of an imponder - able , and it may well be expedient to concede the loss of that much intangible assets with a good grace , lest a worse evil befall .

		But it is not so with the vested rights of ownership .

		These are of the essence of that same quasi-democratic status quo about the preservation of which these elder states - men are concerned . ''

		Discontinuance of the rights of ownership '' is equivalent to '' the day of judg - ment '' for the regime of the elder statesmen and for the interests which they have at heart .

		These in - terests which the elder statesmen have at heart are primarily the interests of trade , investment , and na - tional integrity , and beyond that the ordered sys - tem of law and custom and businesslike prosperity which runs on under the shadow of these interests of trade , investment , and national integrity .

		And these elder statesmen , being honorable gentlemen , and as such being faithful to their bread , see plainly that Russian Bolshevism is a menace to all the best interests of mankind .

		So there prevails among the astute keepers of law and order in other lands an uneasy statesmanlike dread of '' Bolshevist infection , '' which it is con - sidered will surely follow on any contact or com - munication across the Russian frontiers .

		There is a singular unanimity of apprehension on this matter of '' Bolshevist infection '' among the votaries of law and order .

		Precautionary measures of isola - tion are therefore devised something like quaran - tine to guard against the infection .

		It should be noted that this statesmanlike fear of Bolshevist in - fection is always a fear that the common man in these other countries may become infected .

		The elder statesmen have no serious apprehension that the statesmen themselves are likely to be infected with Bolshevism , even by fairly reckless exposure , or that the military class , or the clergy , or the land - lords , or the business men at large are liable to such infection .

		Indeed it is assumed as a matter of course that the vested interests and the kept classes ; are immune , and it will be admitted that the as - sumption is reasonable .

		The measures of quaran - tine are , accordingly , always designed to safeguard those classes in the community who have no vested rights to lose .

		It is always as a system of ideas , or '' principles , '' THE DIAL
February 22	DATE	that Bolshevism spreads by communication ; it is a contamination of ideas , of habits of thought .

		And it owes much of its insidious success to tjie fact that this new order of ideas which it proposes is ex - tremely simple and is in the main of a negative character .

		The Bolshevist scheme of ideas comes easy to the common man because it does not require him to learn much that is new , but mainly to un - learn much that is old .

		It does not propose the adoption of a new range of preconceptions , so that it calls for little in the way of acquiring new habits of thought .

		In the main it is an emancipation from older preconceptions , older habitual convictions .

		And the proposed new order of ideas will displace the older preconceptions all the more easily because these older habitual convictions that are due to be displaced , no longer have the support of those ma - terial circumstances which now condition the life of the common man , and which will therefore make the outcome by bending his habits of thought .

		The training given by the mechanical industries and strengthened by the experience of daily life in a mechanically organized community lends no sup - port to prescriptive rights of ownership , class per - quisites , and free income .

		This training bends the mental attitude of the common man at cross-pur - poses with the established system of rights , and makes it easy for him to deny their validity so soon as there is sufficient provocation .

		And it is scarcely necessary for him to find a substitute for these principles of vested right that so fall away from him .

		It is true , these prescriptive rights , about whose maintenance and repair the whole quarrel swings and centers , do have the consistent support of those habits of thought that are engendered by experience in business traffic ; and business traffic is a very large and consequential part of life as it runs in these civilized countries .

		But business traffic is not the tone-giving factor in the life of the common man , nor are business interests his interests in so obvious a fashion as greatly to affect his habitual outlook .

		Under the new order of things there is , in effect , a widening gulf fixed between the business traffic and those industrial occupations that shape the habits of thought of the common man .

		The business corh - .

		munity , who are engaged in this business traffic and whose habitual attention centers on the rights of ownership and income , are consistent votaries of the old order , as their training and interest would dic - tate .

		And these are also immune against any sub - versive propaganda , however insidious , as has al - ready been remarked above .

		Indeed , it is out of this division of classes in respect of their habitual outlook and of their material interests that the whole difficultv arises , and it is by force of this divi - sion that this subversive propaganda becomes a menace .

		Both parties are acting on conviction , and there is , therefore , no middle ground for them to meet on . ''

		Thrice is he armed who knows his quar - rel just '' ; and in this case both parties to the quar - rel are convinced of the justice of their own cause , at the same time that the material fortunes of both are at stake 1 .

		Hence an unreserved recourse to force , with all its consequences .

		By first intention and by consistent aim
Bolshe	PERSON	- vism is a menace to the vested rights of property and of privilege , and from this the rest follows .

		The vested interests are within their legal and moral rights , and it is not to be expected that they will yield these '' rights amicably .

		All those classes , fac - tions , and interests that stand to lose have made common cause against the out-and-outers , have em - ployed armed force where that has been practicable , and have resorted to such measures of intrigue and sabotage as they can command .

		All of which is quite reasonable , in a way , since these vested inter - ests are legally and morally in the right according to the best of their knowledge and belief ; but the consequence of their righteous opposition , intrigue , and obstruction has been strife , disorder , privation and bloodshed , with a doubtful and evil prospect ahead .

		Among the immediate consequences of this quar - rel , according to the reports which have been al - lowed to come through to the outside , is alleged to be a total disorganization and collapse of the indus - trial system throughout the Russian dominions , in - cluding the transportation system and the food sup - ply .

		From which has followed famine , pestilence , and pillage , uncontrolled and uncontrollable .

		How - ever , there are certain outstanding facts which it will be in place to recall , in part because they are habitually overlooked or not habitually drawn on for correction of the published reports .

		The Bol - shevist administration has now been running for something over a year , which will include one crop season .

		During this time it has been gaining ground , particularly during the later months of this period ; and this gain has been made in spite of a very considerable resistance , active and passive , more or less competently organized and more or less adequately supported from the outside .

		Meantime the '' infection '' is spreading in a way that does not signify a lost cause .

		All the while the administration has been carry - ing on military operations on a more or less extended scale ; and on the whole , and particularly through the latter part of this period , its military operations appear to have been gaining in magnitude and to have met with increasing success , such as would
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 177 argue a more or less adequate continued supply of arms and munitions .

		These military operations have been carried on without substantial supplies from the outside , so that the administration will have had to supply its warlike needs and replace its wear and tear from within the country during this rather costly period .

		It has been said from time to time , of course , that the Bolshevist administration has drawn heavily on German support for funds and material supplies during this period .

		It has been said , but it is very doubtful if it has been believed .

		Quite notoriously the
Bolsheviki	PERSON	have lost more than they have gained at the hands of the Germans .

		And imports of all warlike supplies from any source have been very nearly shut off .

		Such information as has been coming through from the inside , in the way of official reports , runs to the effect that the needed supplies of war ma - terial , including arms and ammunition , have in the main been provided at home from stocks on hand and by taking over various industrial works and oper - ating them for war purposes under administrative control which would argue that the industrial col - lapse and disorganization can not have been so com - plete or so far-reaching as had been feared , or hoped .

		Indeed these reports are singularly out of touch and out of sympathy with the
Associated Press	ORGANIZATION	news bearing on the same general topic .

		It appears , dimly , from the circumstantial evidence that the Bolshevist administration in
Russia	LOCATION	has met with somewhat the same surprising experience as the Democratic administration in
America	LOCATION	that in spite of the haste , confusion , and blundering , incident to taking over the control of industrial works , the same works have after all proved t6 run at a higher efficiency under administrative management than they previously have habitually done when managed by their owners for private gain .

		The point is in doubt , it must be admitted , but the circumstantial evidence , backed by the official reports , appears on the whole to go that way .

		Something to a similar effect will apparently hold true for the transportation system .

		The administra - tion has apparently been able to take over more of the means of transport than the
Associated Press	ORGANIZATION	news would indicate , and to have kept it all in a more nearly reasonable state of repair .

		As is well known , the conduct of successful military opera - tions today quite imperatively requires a competent transport system ; and , in spite of many reverses , it is apparently necessary to admit that the military operations of the Bolshevist administration have on the whole been successful rather than the reverse .

		The inference is plain , so far as concerns the point immediately in question here .

		Doubtless the Rus - sian transportation system is in sufficiently bad shape , but it can scarcely be in so complete a state of collapse as had been reported , feared , and hoped by those who go on the information given out by the standard news agencies .

		If one discounts the selec - tively standardized news dispatches of these agen - cies , one is left with an impression that the railway system , for example , is better furnished with rolling - stock and in better repair in
European Russia	LOCATION	than in
Siberia	LOCATION	, where the Bolshevist administration is not in control .

		This may be due in good part to the fact that the working personnel of the railways and their repair shops are Bolsheviki at heart , both in
Siberia	LOCATION	and in
European Russia	LOCATION	, and that they have therefore withdrawn from the train service and re - pair shops of the Siberian roads as fast as these roads have fallen into non-Bolshevist hands , and have mi - grated into
Russia	LOCATION	to take up the same work among their own friends .

		The transportation system does not appear to have precisely broken down ; the continuance of military operations goes to show that much .

		Also , the crop year of
1918	DATE	is known to have been rather excep - tionally good in
European Russia	LOCATION	, on the whole , so that there will be at least a scant sufficiency of food - stuff back in the country and available for those por - tions of the population who can get at it .

		Also , it will be noted that , by all accounts , the civilian popu - lation of the cities has fallen off to a fraction of its ordinary number , by way of escape to the open country or to foreign parts .

		Those classes who were fit to get a living elsewhere have apparently escaped .

		In the absence of reliable information one would , on this showing , be inclined to say that the remaining civilian population of the cities will be made up chiefly , perhaps almost wholly , of such elements of the so-called middle classes as could not get away or had nowhere to go with any prospect of bettering their lot .

		These will for the most part have been trades people and their specialized em - ployees , persons who are of slight use in any pro- ductive industry and stand a small chance of gaining a livelihood by actually necessary work .

		They be - long to the class of smaller '' middle-men , '' who are in great part ' superfluous in any case , and whose business traffic has been virtually discontinued by the Bolshevist administration .

		These displaced small business men of the Russian cities are as use - less and as helpless under the Bolshevist regime as nine-tenths of the population of the American coun - try towns in the prairie states would be if the retail trade of the prairie states were reorganized in such a way as to do away with all useless duplication .

		The difference is that the
Bolshevist	PERSON	administration of
Russia	LOCATION	has discontinued much of the superfluous retail trade , whereas the democratic administration of
America	LOCATION	takes pains to safeguard the reasonable THE DIAL
February 22	DATE	profits of its superfluous retailers .

		Bolshevism is a menace to the retail trade and to the retailers .

		Accordingly it is to be noted that when details and concrete instances `` of extreme hardship in the cities are given , they will commonly turn out to be hardships which have fallen on some member or class of what the Socialists call the Bourgeoisie , the middle class , the business community , the kept classes more commonly than anything of lower social value or nearer to the soil .

		Those that be - long nearer to the soil appear largely to have escaped from the cities and returned to the soil .

		Now , on a cold and harsh appraisal such as the Ger - mans have made familiar to civilized people under the name of '' military necessity , '' these ''
Bour	PERSON	- geois '' are in part to be considered useless and in part mischievous for all purposes of Bolshevism .

		Under the Bolshevist regime they are '' undesirable citizens , '' who consume without producing and who may be counted on to intrigue against the adminis - tration and obstruct its operation whenever a chance offers .

		From which it follows , on a cold and harsh calculation of '' military necessity , '' that whether the necessary supplies are to be had in the country or not , and whether the transportation system is capable of handling the necessary supplies or not , it might still appear the part of wisdom , or of Bolshe - vist expediency , to leave this prevailingly
Bour	PERSON	- geois and disaffected civilian population of the cities without the necessaries of life .

		The result would be famine , of course , together with the things that go with famine ; but the
Bolsheviki	PERSON	would be in a position to say that they are applying famine selec - tively , as a measure of defense against their enemies within the frontiers , very much as the nations of the Entente once were in a position to argue that the exclusion of foodstuffs from
Germany	LOCATION	during the war was a weapon employed against the enemies of the world 's peace .

		These considerations are , unhappily , very loose and general .

		They amount to little better than cautious speculations on the general drift and upshot of things .

		On the evidence which has yet come to hand and which is in any degree reliable it would be altogether hazardous , just yet , to attempt an analysis of events in detail .

		But it is at least plain that Bolshevism is a menace to the vested interests , at home and abroad .

		So long as its vagaries run their course within the Russian dominions it is pri - marily and immediately a menace to the vested rights of the landowners , the banking establish - ments , the industrial corporations , and not least to the retail traders in the Russian towns .

		The last named are perhaps the hardest hit , because they have relatively little to lose and that little is thejr all .

		The greater sympathy is , doubtless properly , according to the accepted scheme of social values , given to the suffering members of the privileged classes , the kept classes par excellence , but the larger and more acute hardship doubtless falls to the share of the smaller trades-people .

		These , of course , are all to be classified with the vested in - terests .

		But the common man also comes in for his portion .

		He finally bears the cost of it all , and its cost runs finally in terms of privation and blood .

		But it menaces also certain vested interests out - side of
Russia	LOCATION	, particularly the vested rights of in - vestors in Russian industries and natural resources , as well as of concerns which have an interest in the Russian import and export trade .

		So also the vested rights of investors in Russian securities .

		Among the latter claimants are now certain governments lately associated with
Russia	LOCATION	in the conduct of the war , and more particularly the holders of Russian imperial bonds .

		Of the latter many are French citizens , it is said ; and it has been remarked that the French statesmen realize the menace of Bolshevism perhaps even more acutely than the common run of those elder statesmen who are now deliberating on the state of mankind at large and the state of Rus - sian Bolshevism in particular .

		But the menace of Bolshevism extends also to the common man in those other countries whose vested interests have claims on Russian income and re - sources .

		These vested rights of these claimants in foreign parts are good and valid in law and morals , and therefore by settled usage it is the duty of these foreign governments to enforce these vested rights of their several citizens who have a claim on Rus - sian income and resources ; indeed it is the duty of these governments , to which they are in honor bound and to which they are addicted by habit , to enforce these vested claims to Russian income and resources by force of arms if necessary .

		And it is well known , and also it is right and good by law and custom , that when recourse is had to arms the common man pays the cost .

		He pays it in lost labor , anxiety , privation , blood and wounds ; and by way of returns he comes in for an increase of just national pride in the fact that the vested interests which find shelter under the same national estab - lishment with himself are duly preserved from loss on their Russian investments .

		So that , by a '' roundabout process of production , '' Bolshevism is also a menace to the common man .

		How it stands with the menace of Bolshevism in the event of its infection reaching any other of the civilized countries as , for example ,
America	LOCATION	or
France	LOCATION	that is a sufficiently perplexing problem to which the substantial citizens and the statesmen to whose keeping the fortunes of the substantial citi -
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 179 zens are entrusted , have already begun to give their best attention .

		They are substantially of one mind , and all are sound on the main fact , that Bolshevism is a menace ; and now and again they will specify that it is a menace to property and business .

		And with that contention there can be no quarrel .

		How it stands , beyond that and at the end of the argu - ment , with the eventual bearing of Bolshevism on the common man and his fortunes , is less clear and is a less immediate object of solicitude .

		On scant reflection it should seem that , since the the common man has substantially no vested rights to lose , he should come off indifferently well in such an event .

		But such a hasty view overlooks the great lesson of history that when anything goes askew in the na - tional economy , or anything is to be set to rights , the common man eventually pays the cost and he pays it eventually in lost labor , anxiety , privation , blood , and wounds .

		The Bolshevik is the common man who has faced the question : What do I stand to lose ?

		and has come away with the answer : Nothing .

		And the elder statesmen are busy with arrangements for disappointing that indifferent hope .

Edmond Rostand	PERSON	Ou fleurit le Droit ?

		C'est dans un endroh
Nomme PHorizon	ORGANIZATION	.

		So sang
Edmond Rostand	PERSON	in what was to be his swan-song , published in the Mid-December number of the Revue des Deux Mondes only a few hours after his death .

		In
1897	DATE	he had became famous at a stroke .

		His heroic-comedy
Cyrano de Bergerac	ORGANIZATION	had in the opinion of the critics given back to
France	LOCATION	her birthright .

		It was heralded as a re - action against the depressing naturalistic drama and proclaimed as the beginning of a new literary epoch . ''

		Quel bonheur , '' exclaimed the critic of Le Temps , '' the play is graceful , it is clear , it has movement and measure , all of them qualities that characterize our race . ''


Catulle Mendes	PERSON	, in a burst of ecstasy , had called
Rostand	PERSON	a great poet , divers , multiple , heureux , follement inspire , et prodigeuse - ment virtuose .

		More temperate voices either were drowned in this wave of general approval or re - solved themselves into the peal of laughter which greeted the absurd suit brought by a
Chicago	LOCATION	pundit to show that Cyrano was plagiarized from the Merchant Prince of
Cornville	LOCATION	.

		To all this we shall return presently .

		Let it be said now , without derogation , that
Rostand	PERSON	remains in death , as in life , the '' poet of the horizon . ''

		This is his dis - tinction and his limitation .

		Like his own Chantecler he heralds the dawn , he does not for he can not realize it .

		In passionate protest , the Lady-Pheasant reproves the worthy Cock with : '' One is every - thing for a heart , nothing for a horizon '' ; little did she know that his view was yet to triumph .

		In La Princesse Lointaine , the weakling
Bertrand	PERSON	says to Melissinde : '' I should fear too much to see the sail on the horizon '' symbol that it is of
Rudel	PERSON	's love and their betrayal of it .

		But the great war also has its horizons .


Rostand	PERSON	, the herald of the dawn , had lived to see
France	LOCATION	victorious .

		Cer - tainly , he had done his share with the munificence of the spirit .

		Not only Cyrano , but all his plays and poems had been a rallying cry for those who despaired of the future .

		The celebrated '' Mais quel geste '' of
Cyrano	LOCATION	, after he has hurled his purse to the indigent players , is not merely panache , it is also the act of faith of a generous and valiant soul . ''

		Moi , c'est moralement que j' ai mes elegances , '' says Cyrano , and rightly .

		For it was to the moral conscience of his race that
Rostand	PERSON	made his appeal .

		Therefore , the lesson of the war is clear .

		The poem I have cited says '' Que devons-nous aux morts ?

		Rendre leur mort feconde '' ; and it tri - umphs with the lines : Qu'un peuple d'hier Meure pour demain , C'est a rendre fier Tout le genre humain !

		Is there not discernible in the moment of
Rostand	PERSON	's death , as throughout his life , the shielding hand of
Providence	LOCATION	?

		There is no doubt that he owed much to Fortune .

		Born at
Marseilles	LOCATION	-LRB- 1868 -RRB- , he was educated in
Paris	LOCATION	at the
College Stanislas	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is a Provencal flavor to the tale that he urged his schoolmates to curl their mustaches before they had any '' meme si vous n'en avez pas . ''

		At twenty-two he published his first poems : Les Musardises .

		Dedicated to his '' bons amis les Rates '' -LSB- the unsuccessful -RSB- , these early verses have a freshness , a boldness and a lim - pidity which made them popular at once .

		Imme - diately after their publication he married
Rosemonde Gerard	PERSON	, his companion in letters .

		The refusal of a one act comedy by the Comedie frangaise was ac - companied by the request for '' another act , '' and a week later
Rostand	PERSON	handed M. de Feraudy the beginning of
Les Romanesques	ORGANIZATION	.

		The performance of the latter in
1894	DATE	at the Theatre frangais estab - lished
Rostand	PERSON	's position as a writer of verse-drama .

		But it was the two great actors of the Theatre i8o THE DIAL
February 22	DATE	de la Renaissance , the Divine
Sarah	PERSON	and
Coquelin	PERSON	, who turned
Rostand	PERSON	's budding fame into glory .

		La Princesse Lointaine , despite its dramatic third act on which the masterful actress lavished all of her wonderful technique , was too subtle for '' the stage optics '' to win more than a succes d'estime .

		At least ,
Sarcey	ORGANIZATION	's criticism was not favorable .

		Two years later , in La Samaritaine ,
Rostand	PERSON	treated a religious subject which was quite beyond his poetic grasp .

		Thus it remained for Cyrano to produce the magic that opened the hearts of the world .

		Here the poet 's gifts had full play .

		Revival to be sure , yet what a revival !

		We can trust
Rostand	PERSON	's words that the idea of recreating the story of Corneille 's blustering but inspired contemporary had long been slumbering in his mind .

		It was the contact with
Coquelin	PERSON	and the desire to eternalize the actor in the play that impelled
Rostand	PERSON	to put his idea into exe - cution .

		In this way
Coquelin	PERSON	became Cyrano and
Cyrano Coquelin	ORGANIZATION	.

		I wished to dedicate this poem to Cyrano 's soul But since it has passed into you ,
Coquelin	LOCATION	, to you I dedicate it .

		For this reason it is so difficult , not to say impossi - ble , for any other actor to take the part .

		To the French , however , the play had also a deeper signifi - cance .

		Granting that Cyrano is reminiscent of
Gautier	PERSON	,
Banville	PERSON	, and Hugo , we must not forget that it was especially
Rostand	PERSON	's footing in the seven - teenth century , the period of the Fronde , the age when
France	LOCATION	was really in the making , when the French spirit still flowed free and untrammeled by les regies du devoir and classical precepts , that ren - dered the comedy what it is to the French .

		The gratitude of
France	LOCATION	won for
Rostand	PERSON	the croix de chevalier the very evening of the perform - ance .

		And in
1903	DATE	he entered the portals of the Academy with an address in which panache , the key-word of Cyrano , is , , wittily but euphuistically described : Plaisanter en face du danger , c'est la supreme politesse , un delicat refus de se prendre au tragiqile ; le panache est alors la pudeur de I ` hero'isme , comme un sourire par lequel on s ` excuse d'etre sublime .

		The rest is quickly told .

		L'Aiglon , written to the theme of Hugo 's antithesis -LRB- 1 ` Angleterre prit 1 ` aigle et 1 ` Autriche 1 ` aiglon -RRB- , was the success of
Sarah Bernhardt	PERSON	's Hamletizing period , but for
Rostand	PERSON	it marks a relapse into excessive Marivaudage .

		The ' princeling ' is too shadowy a figure for a nation to whom
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	is an ever-present reality .

		As for the long-awaited Chantecler the performance of which was delayed by
Coquelin	ORGANIZATION	's death it too was a disappointment .

		True to French tradition as the animal world is , and deeply as
Chantecler	ORGANIZATION	's hymn to the sun stirred the audience , nevertheless the action of the play lags ;
Rostand	PERSON	's favorite trick of playing on words le cliquetis des mots is over - done , and the disguise of the characters as birds and beasts hampers the actors in their movements .

		Thus
Cyrano de Bergerac	ORGANIZATION	remains the outstand - ing production in
Rostand	LOCATION	's career and work .


Pellissier	PERSON	, who realized more clearly than the other critics the epigonous character of
Rostand	PERSON	's art , yet can not withhold from Cyrano the epithet of chef-d'oeuvre .

		It is true , strictly speaking , the play has but one character and that character is a type rather than a person .

		True too that the action does not conform to genre as well as one would expect of one of
Rostand	PERSON	's virtuosity ; the fourth act comes close to opera-bouffe in spite of the tragedy of Christian 's death , while the fifth is in the tone of sentimental romance .

		Nor can it be denied that again and again the speeches are tours de force , clever and almost always scintillating , but often just that .

		Still , as was indicated above , what makes the play is the complete adjustment of the modern lyric mood to the freedom , the gaiety , the bravado of the romanesque .

		And the romanesque is not necessarily the `` ro - mantic . ''

		Cyrano is no dark figure in cape and dagger like
Hernani	LOCATION	.

		He is not '' une force qui va , '' a man of destiny .

		None of
Rostand	ORGANIZATION	's characters are .

		He is simply a frondeur , an individualist if you like , but with no ax to grind ; a rate like so many of us , because of some physical or other de - formity , but taking it gaily , humorously , poetically , with a sense of hope and freshness in his heart .

		In comparison , the lover
Rudel	PERSON	in La Princesse Loin - taine and the
Duke of Reichstadt	ORGANIZATION	are sublimated creatures .

		Chantecler alone has Cyrano 's valor , his willingness to sacrifice himself for a beautiful cause , and in addition his trust in the future . ''

		C'est que je suis le Coq d'un soleil plus lointain , '' Chantecler tells the doubting Pheasant .

		As for his song , his song of Light and the Day '' Je chante !

		... et c'est deja la moitie du mystere . ''

		In
Rostand	PERSON	, then , there is fancy rather - than imagination .

		His lyricism is optimistic , wholesome , even buoyant .

		It would be a profanation to call so delicate a flower great .

		Moreover , he came to literature via the consecrated channels of literary norms and formulas .

		Therein he is singularly French .

		His works bristle with near-quotations , as they abound in quotable lines .

		What French - man , fond of his literature , does not know the verses : Et ma raison s ` endort au bruit sempiternel , Au bruit sempiternel des jets d'eau dans les vasques , and admire their beauty ?

		Thus French wit and sentiment , always so close together that they seem to merge , are reborn in the works of
Edmond Ros	PERSON	- IQIQ THE DIAL 181 tand .

		If others who are more materially minded had forgotten the Gallic sources of inspiration at least , not he .

		So the critics realized , and so felt the French nation .

		The Princesse Lointaine that true Princess of the
Horizon	LOCATION	reminds her worldly lover : '' Combien dans le mediocre ou vivre nous enserre , Le sublime de cet amour m ` est necessaire . ''

		Rostand , as we said at the beginning , is the '' poet of the horizon , '' but of the eastern heavens , where the sun does not set but rises .


WILLIAM A. NITZE	PERSON	.

		I Rogue 's
March	DATE	: To a
Flemish Air .1	ORGANIZATION	is A GENEROUS publishing season that to The Education of
Henry Adams	PERSON	and The Great Hunger adds The Legend of the
Glorious Adventures of Tyl Ulenspiegel	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- McBride ;
$ 2.50	MONEY	-RRB- .

		Not often , one may assert , are thus coincidently given for the first time to Americans three volumes with such a plausible air of being destined to longevity al - though the cautious will affix to such assertion the < ; rider '' that each book centers about a personality which is by way of being unfairly beguiling -LRB- in that it is a personality evocative of the reader 's friendship , in the instant happy way in which peo - ple between bookcovers are privileged to establish such relations with beings less permanently boun , d in flesh -RRB- and so evades calm judgment .

		For to many of us these figure nowadays as new-found , heart-delighting , and eminently '' personal '' friends , this
Ulenspiegel	PERSON	and this
Peer Holm	PERSON	, come severally from
Belgium	LOCATION	and
Norway	LOCATION	, and this wistful
Adams	PERSON	, lately freed from the decent reticences of living so that we appraise them with the bias of friend - ' ship , doubtless , rather than by any code of `` literary '' values .

		The honest can but confess as much , and must then pass on to further confession that of the in - triguing trio one finds Tyl Ulenspiegel the most dif - ficult to judge with any pretense of equky , because this
Tyl	PERSON	is so frankly a rogue .

		It would be pleasant here to digress into speculation as to why in Bnglish literature there should be so few rogues portrayed full-length ; and above all , as to why
America	LOCATION	, that in daily life derives such naive pleasure from being cheated by '' fine business men '' and '' far-seeing statesmen , '' should have produced in its writings no really memorable rogue , with the possible exception of Uncle Remus ' Brer Rabbit .

		But , upon the whole , it appears preferable to say quite simply that
Tyl Ulenspiegel	PERSON	has been for some five centuries famed among the people of
Belgium	LOCATION	and the Nether - lands as a sort of Dutch Figaro or Scapin as '' mischief-maker , jack-of-all-trades , and by turn fool , artist , valet and physician '' ; that this char - acter was appropriated and ennobled by
Charles de Coster	PERSON	as the central figure of a heroic romance , La Legende de
Tiel Uylenspiegel	PERSON	, published in
1867	DATE	, and since known as '' the Bible of the
Flemings	ORGANIZATION	'' ; and that this book has been , recently translated into our tongue by
Geoffrey Whitworth	PERSON	.

		This much it appears preferable to say as simply as possible and with frank egoism , because I am endeavoring to record my personal belief that an exceedingly splendid and great-hearted example of literary art has for the first time been rendered into delight - fully adequate English ; as likewise my belief that a masterpiece , such as I personally take this book to constitute , should be greeted simply , and reverently , and without vain speaking .

		Even to '' recommend '' it seems rather on a par with saying pleasant things about a sunrise .

		So honest comment can but come back to this : for
Tyl Ulenspiegel	ORGANIZATION	himself one straightway estab - lishes a sort of peculiarly personal liking , a liking quite unbased on '' literary '' values , and an un - moralizing liking such as entraps you into indigna - tion when the reforming Henry the Fifth ' re - pudiates that other not-unlovable rogue , Sir
John Falstafr	PERSON	. ''

		A Fleming I am , '' says
Tyl	PERSON	, '' from the lovely land of
Flanders	LOCATION	, workingman , nobleman , all in one and I go wandering through the world , praising things beautiful and good , but boldly mak - ing fun of foolishness . ''

		So does
Tyl	PERSON	describe him - self , and the description is apt , as far as it reaches , but is overmodestly incommensurate to the speaker 's variousness .

		Thus
Tyl	PERSON	can be upon occasion a very pretty fightingman indeed , performing salutary homicides with heroic thoroughness .

		Here is a random taste of his quality : Ulenspiegel took careful aim , and with his bullet shattered the tongue and the entire jawbone of
Don Ruffele Henricis	PERSON	, son of the
Duke	ORGANIZATION	.

		At the same time
Ulenspiegel	ORGANIZATION	brought down the son of the Marquess Delmares , and in a little while v more the eight ensigns and the three cohorts of cavalry were thoroughly worsted .

		The prisoners imagined that some angel from heaven , who was also a fine marksman , had descended ` from the sky to aid them , and they all fell upon their knees .

		Such a deduction was natural enough , to illiterate prisoners ; but the erudite will recognize forthwith the authentic manner of a national hero ; for thus it was that Roland laid about him at
Roncesvaux	LOCATION	, and in very much this fashion did Achilles choke Scamander with slain Trojans .

		So much of physical prowess one has the fair and 182
February 22	DATE	ancient right to expect of a national hero .

		But quite another facet of the jewel is the roguish , not at all '' heroic ''
Tyl	PERSON	who delights in jokes that are not always pre-eminent for delicacy .

		Then , too , although
Tyl	PERSON	is of course devotedly attached to the fair
Nele	PERSON	, and their marriage at the end of his wanderings is a foregone conclusion , nobody can ex - pect a rogue meticulously to emulate
Joseph	PERSON	.

		And
Tyl	PERSON	, be it repeated , is frankly a rogue .

		One there - fore must regard with equanimity the Walloon maiden to whose house
Tyl	PERSON	went to sing some Flemish love-songs which , what with one thing and another , were not ended until
midnight	TIME	.

		Then there was the beautiful , gay-hearted dame whom
Tyl	PERSON	guided to Dudzeel ; in all dealings with young men she abhorred in particular the sin of cruelty , and so
Tyl	PERSON	left her with flushed cheeks but not displeased .

		Moreover , there was the
Comtesse de Meghen	ORGANIZATION	, an - other benevolent lady , who offered
Ulenspiegel	PERSON	hos - pitality , in the to him inadequate form of ham and bruinbier . ' ''

		Ham ! ''

		he cried , '' that is good to eat , and bruinbier is a drink divine .

		But blessed above all men shall that man be to whom it is given to dine off thy loveliness . '' ''

		How the fellow does run on ! ''

		she exclaimed ; and then : '' Eat first , you rogue ! '' ''

		Shall we not say grace ` ere we con - sume all these dainties ? ''

		said
Ulenspiegel	PERSON	. ''

		Nay , '' answered the lady ; and presently congratulated
Tyl	PERSON	, as in nothing resembling her husband .

		In fine ,
Tyl	PERSON	marches , in the pride of youth , about a world of brightly colored and generous women , and graces a world wherein he displays as much continence as appears consistent with politeness , and wherein
Joseph	PERSON	, in the final outcome , could not manage to combine these virtues .

		So likewise this rogue marches , with chance for guide , about a world that even then was ruled by folly and bigotry ; and he treads blithely , as be - fits '' a master of the merry words and frolics of youth , '' in shadow r ed places where his gibbeted kindred swing between him and the sun .

		For the ashes of a martyred father lie upon
Tyl	PERSON	's breast without at all oppressing a heart whose core is roguishness .

		Therefore in the presence of injustice
Tyl Ulenspiegel	PERSON	does not slink , not even into draw - ing morals ; instead , with chance for guide , he marches .

		For those who would wrong him his eye and tongue and sword stay equally keen , and the rogue knows these weapons to be in the long run sufficient ; meanwhile , that there should be over - troublesome fellows to be killed now and then is as naturally a part of wandering as that there should everywhere be girls to be kissed and flagons to be emptied , and songs to be made beyond any numbering , but never the last song .

		So the rogue marches and puts all things to their proper uses .

		And the heart of the reader , given something better than the heart of a flea , goes out to this resistless rogue .

		It is around this sprightly figure that De
Coster	PERSON	has woven -LRB- cotemporaneously , it is bewildering to reflect , with the weaving of a dreary mystery about one
Edwin Drood	PERSON	-RRB- a romance as cruel as life and considerably gayer .

		Somewhat to deviate meta - phorically , in this tale of fifteenth century
Flanders	ORGANIZATION	under the yoke of
Spain	LOCATION	and the
Holy Inquisition	ORGANIZATION	, De
Coster	PERSON	has builded a story that is not unlike a time-mellowed cathedral , with the gentry about their devotions , and with peasants joking on the porches , and with a stately organ music accompanying both aspiration and laughter ; a cathedral , too , that is no less opulent in glowing paintings than in captivat - ingly hideous gargoyles .

		And here again one is tempted to expatiate concerning these gargoyles as , say , upon the chapter that depicts the death of Charles the Fifth and his trial in heaven ; or per - haps upon
Tyl	PERSON	's hunting of the werwolf ; or else to dw r ell upon that really intolerable '' catharsis by pity and terror , '' when Katheline the good witch attempts to share her cup of cold water with
Joos Damman	PERSON	in the torture chamber although this last is a stroke of genius with which perhaps no author has the '' right to unsettle his reader .

		Yes , one is tempted to expatiate .

		But once more it appears preferable to remember that a masterwork should be greeted simply , and reverently , and with - out vain speaking .

WYNNE	PERSON	.

		1919 THE DIAL 183 Letters to Unknown Women THE AMARYLLIS OF THEOCRITUS Lo AMARYLLIS : You can not have known , O white violet of Si - cilia , that immeasurable tedium and exhaustion which weighs upon those who endure today the tyranny of existence , Certainly the poet who cre - ated you from his yearning for the valleys of
Sicily	LOCATION	in the dust and clatter of
Alexandria	LOCATION	would under - stand us , but you , whom he created free from that malady , ^ saw life with eyes not feverish as ours are .

		It is your exquisite animality , with perfect freedom from self-consciousness , which makes us love you .

		Your presence is as soothing to our wearied des - perate souls as white violet petals pressed against tired eyes .

		We are not of those who , by some sudden deed or by a life of activity , impress their personality upon centuries .

		We think in millions and act in millions ; we know with only too dread a certainty that each and every one of our acts is imitated , un - consciously and precisely , by thousands about us .

		We have just a slim thread of that divine common sense your Athenians called ''
Pallas	PERSON	, '' which pre - vents our falling into uncouth extravagances or dis - sonant obstinacies , as some do , to avoid the banality of this vast mediocrity .

		We are cut off from almost every exercise of talent or power which would satisfy us .

		Who speaks of Euripedes to the Beo - tians ?

		We are driven back upon a form of existence which has been named '' the life of imagination '' a weak substitute for that bright burning life you lived a life we liken from our darkness to a clear gold flame .

		It seems the only existence compatible with calm and intelligence , two qualities you could not fail to appreciate .

		But even the exercise of that faint simulacrum of your intensity is denied us now .

		We had willingly abandoned most of those actions and possessions which men consider desirable , so that we might possess full liberty within that shadowy but vast world which was ours .

		But through a disastrous sequence of events which no wisdom could foresee or cunning provide for , we are deprived even of that which we had , and are abandoned helpless , or nearly so , to the vulgar in - stincts of mob passion and control .

		Ah , Amaryllis , those who gave Socrates the hemlock were merci - ful ; and did Hyacinthus die today , we should feel through our sorrow a kind of gladness and grati - tude to that jealous blast of wind .

		We know , O Sicilian , that your life was impos - sible , a dream , that you are the product of a sick imagination ; but for that very reason you burn like a flame before us , you seduce us , you entrance us , you are mysterious as a flower , you are the un - known .

		In the midst of our incredible helplessness your beauty makes one clear ray .

		Because , for your sake , the singers contended upon the slopes of
Aetna	ORGANIZATION	, among the still valleys , beside the cold brooks , life is not utterly valueless to us .

		For your sake the first narcissus of the year catches our hearts with a sudden new beauty ; be - cause of you the five-petaled roses along our north - ern hills become doubly lovely .

		With such roses you bound your dark hair ; such narcissus flowers you laid upon the altars of your half-gods .

		And through you also we understand the correspondence between love and flowers , we feel suddenly the presence of gods .

		We stagger through life blindly ; we fumble among half-perceptions , half-desires .

		But with the dear melody of your speech in our ears there are moments when the world becomes clear .

		We perceive for a flash that there is more truth in your simplicity than in the subtilty of all our learned men and women .

		We come to value kindness and simplicity above almost all other qualities .

		You give us , just for a moment , the power to reach that blitheness which for you was natural , for us an effort .

		We are seduced yes , literally seduced by a glimpse of brown breasts and by a snatch of shrill song from our gloomy strug - gle , our perpetual fronting of grim unknown forces .

		Our universe shrinks from an overwhelm - ing vastness to your pastoral shores ; our desperate fever yields to the touch of your hand .

		We see that there is more beauty in one wreath of your perfect , conventional flowers than in all our intellectual striving .

		We leave the great gods for the less , con - tent to realize that indeed there is a spirit in an oak and a white girl in a brook rather than to search vaguely for the '' deus ignotus . ''

		There was a learned man of our country who was so stirred by your poets that he spent many months alone in your woods and saw the white nymphs flitting from tree to tree , heard with awe the rush of
Artemis	ORGANIZATION	' hounds and the sough of her shafts through the pine boughs , watched the daughter of the Earth-Shaker sitting at night upon weeded rocks above cool water .

		His name I have forgot - ten ; I have never seen the strange book he wrote after those mysterious days ; but it is happiness to know that he also is your lover and knows the Sicilian singing .

ALDINGTON	PERSON	.

		184 THE DIAL
February 22	DATE	.

		Liu
Louis Couperus	PERSON	and the Family Novel -LSB- E FAMILY novel as distinguished from the heroic has an equally honorable lineage .

		Undoubtedly the first principle of structure recognized in fiction was the persistence of the hero , usually in a series of enterprises which took him far from home ; but when the chronicler of a more sophisticated day sought to deal with man in society , he naturally chose as his unit the immediate form of grouping known to him , and we have the family dramas of the
House of Atreus	ORGANIZATION	and the
House of Oedipus	ORGANIZATION	.

		When the novel succeeded in modern times to the place of the epic we have the same opposition .

		Early novels followed the simple heroic type .

		In - deed , in the popular form of the picaresque novel the hero was separated from his forebears as soon after birth as was consistent with survival what do we hear of the family of Lazarillo de Tormez or
Moll Flanders	PERSON	?

		and proceeded to weave for him - self a pattern of adventure quite independent of organized society .

		With greater sophistication on the part of the novelist the family background plays an increasingly important role .

		The first part of
Pamela	LOCATION	is of the heroic type : the second part of the family .

		Fielding after
Joseph Andrews	PERSON	and
Tom Jones	PERSON	achieved a family novel in
Amelia	LOCATION	.

		In
Tristam Shandy	ORGANIZATION	the flagrant omission of the hero leaves what pattern there is to be supported by the
Shandy	PERSON	family .

		In the nineteenth century the romantic novel tended toward the heroic , with its picaresque variant ; the novel of manners toward the family type .


Jane Austen	PERSON	set her heroines in families ; and in
Thackeray	LOCATION	families persist from novel to novel , giving a sense of social fabric to the whole `` of his work .

		In The Newcomes , indeed , he gives a family the power of a chief and determin - ing character a position analogous to Nature in
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	1 and it may be said comes near to creating a family novel in the true sense .

		Only with the artistic concentration and technical self-consciousness of very modern work do we reach the true family novel that in which hero and hero - ine disappear as types and are merged in the back - ground , and their family group becomes the recog - nizable entity in which the characters live and move and have their being .

		One does not readily find examples of such concentration and self - conscious - ness in English fiction , but two instances in con - tinental fiction emerge Buddenbrooks by
Thomas Mann	PERSON	and Books of the
Small Souls	ORGANIZATION	by
Louis Couperus	PERSON	.

		-LRB- Small Souls , The Later Life , Twilight of Souls , and Dr.
Adriaan	PERSON	, translated by
Alexander Teixeira de Mattos Dodd Mead	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.75	MONEY	. -RRB-

		In the former the family lives though the characters die lives from the end of the Napoleonic era through four generations of births , marriages , scandals , and deaths .

		The center of this life is the family business , in the old Hanseatic city of
Lubeck	LOCATION	, and the family fortune .

		Though
Lubeck	LOCATION	was out of the main cur - rent of events , scarcely shaken by the Revolution of
1848	DATE	, and prudently avoiding the fate of
Frankfort	LOCATION	in
1866	DATE	, it affords an excellent vantage ground whence to follow the development of
Germany	LOCATION	politically , economically , culturally .

		The
Budden	PERSON	- brooks did not keep up with this expansion ; they were small people , well fitted to play their part with dignity in old
Germany	LOCATION	, quite unfit for it in the new .

		They perished in sign that the old
Germany	LOCATION	had passed away .

		Couperus has chosen another pattern : he has arranged his characters , also four generations , like stars in their orbits about the ancient mother of the race ,
Mamma van Lowe	PERSON	, widow of a former Governor General of
Java	LOCATION	, who lives alone in her mansion at the
Hague	LOCATION	, and draws her family about her every
Sunday	DATE
night	TIME	.

		These reunions recur throughout the four volumes and remind us , if need were , of the fact that this multitude of small souls lives chiefly in the family .

		There is
Bertha	LOCATION	, the eldest daughter , married to van
Naghel van Voorde	PERSON	, Secretary for the Colonies , the only one of her children who recalls to
Mamma	LOCATION	van
Lowe	PERSON	her own former state and her children ,
Otto	PERSON	, and
Louise	PERSON	,
Henri	PERSON	and
Emilie	PERSON	,
Marietje	PERSON	and
Marianne	PERSON	and Karel the fourth generation appearing in Otto 's children .

		There is
Adolphine Saetzema	LOCATION	, eager to rival her sister 's position with only an under secretary for husband , and an unkempt brood of girls and boys .

		There is
Gerrit	LOCATION	, Captain of
Hussars	ORGANIZATION	, married to plump bread-and-butter
Adeline	PERSON	who has brought him nine children ; there is Karel who lives in selfish sloth with his stupid wife Cateau ; and
Paul	PERSON	, the exquisite ; and
Ernst	ORGANIZATION	, the connoisseur ; and
Dorine	PERSON	, who flits about , messen - ger of the family .

		And there is Constance , bright - est star of all , who had married her father 's friend De Staffelaer , ambassador at
Rome	LOCATION	, .

		and then shot madly from her sphere into intrigue , scandal , and divorce ; had been raised thence only by a marriage of reparation with her lover
Henri Van der Welcke	PERSON	, and who comes at the opening of the first volume with her son Addie to revolve again , with tarnished glory and in remote orbit , among her sisters and brothers .

		There is
Mamma	LOCATION	van
Lowe	PERSON	's brother ,
Uncle Ruyvenaer	PERSON	, and his half-caste family with their East Indian words and ways and food ; and her two old sisters , the Aunts
Rina	PERSON	and
Tina	PERSON	who ,
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 185 deaf and half-witted , sit on
Sunday	DATE	evenings at opposite sides of the conservatory door , and shriek scandal .

		So resolute is
Couperus	PERSON	in the enforcement of his formula that scarcely a person is mentioned who is not of the van
Lowes	PERSON	or connected with them by marriage or domestic service .

		We hear of the world of people only as it looks on the family drama or comments and gossips .

		Like the Buddenbrooks , the van
Lowes	PERSON	are little people , living out the life of a family the initiative impulse of which has passed away .

		And yet , through them we feel the very essential things in Dutch life and culture , not historically , through the development of an epoch of political creation , but statically , as befits a nation retired from business and living in the suburbs of the world , intent on its own comfort and well-being .

		Now and then there comes a breath from over-seas , from the Indies , reminiscent of the adventuring days of the race and the glory of the family when Grand - papa van
Lowe	PERSON	was Governor General in his palaces at
Batavia	LOCATION	, and
Buitenzorg	LOCATION	; reminiscent also of the source of the income which gives the nation and the family their patent of respectability as of the leisure class .

		But this only serves to emphasize by contrast the dull montony of the world in which they live .

		We feel the ease and well-bred indolence , the triviality and mechanical precision of life , the lack of creation and ambition , the morbid fatigue which takes possession of the consciousness .

		There is no career for the boys to choose except in one of the various routines ; there is none for the girls except to marry into one .

		There is no outlet for artistic impulse except
Ernst	ORGANIZATION	's collection of bibelots and
Paul	PERSON	's effort to keep himself clean .

		When
Emilie	PERSON	and her brother
Henri	PERSON	revolt and flee to the
Bohemia	LOCATION	of
Paris	LOCATION	, it is to a bizarre mockery of art ; she paints fans and he becomes a clown .

		On such a stage the motives and passions sink to a Lilliputian scale .

		Couperus has written a family novel of small souls clinging pitifully together ; he has written likewise a national novel , an argument against the right of self-determination of small nations .

		Among these characters it is impossible to say that any one has preeminence , nor is there any sustained plot .

		The personal title makes Dr.
Adriaan	PERSON	, Con - stance 's son
Addie	PERSON	, the hero of the last volume , as throughout he has been the rising hope of the family , but even here his emphasis is not unduly great .

		In - stead of a plot , or a predominance of character ,
Couperus	PERSON	has elaborated a structure depending on the recurrence of themes as in a symphony .

		Small Souls begins with the sin of
Constance	PERSON	, brought home to her after twelve years as she rejoins the family circle , and this theme is sounded through the different characters , each responding with a single quality as recognizable as that of a musical instru - ment in the clear , boyish honesty of
Addie	LOCATION	, in the whining gossip of Karel and Cateau , in the vindic - tive jealousy of Adolphine , in the selfish caution of
Bertha	LOCATION	, in the screams of \ the ancient aunts .

		The Later Life is built on themes of passion , the tender wistful love of
Henri	PERSON	van der Welcke for
Marianne van Naghel	PERSON	, and of Constance for Brauws loves more pitful because born of small souls and destined to such brief bloom .

		And these themes again are sounded by character after character as in strings , woodwinds , and brasses .

		The
Twilight of Souls	ORGANIZATION	is a madness
Ernst	ORGANIZATION	going mad with fear for the souls imprisoned in his vases ,
Gerrit	LOCATION	, the brawny hussar , with horror of '' the great fat worm , a beastly crawling thing which rooted with its legs in his back and slowly ate him up , the damned rotten thing . ''

		The two strains mingle and respond
Ernst	ORGANIZATION	's thin , anxious treble , and
Gerrit	ORGANIZATION	's deep , tortured bass , which falls at least into broken , childish quavers and finally to silence .

		And in Dr.
Adriaan	PERSON	there is weariness and calm soft with sub - dued pathos and monotonous melancholy .

		The old themes are recalled and repeated but they have lost their tragic import .

		Nothing matters nothing but rest .

		And at the end the old
Mamma	ORGANIZATION	van
Lowe	PERSON	dies .

		It is a symphony pathetique , with its four massive subjects , sin , love , madness , rest , rendered in four movements allegro non troppo , andante cantabile , scherzo feroce , and adagio lamentoso .

		As the human background of Dutch life and in - terests is implicit , in the Books of Small Souls , so without formal description the Dutch landscape is everywhere present , its flatness and humility in physical congruity with the beings that crawl upon it .

		And the weather is a perpetual reminder of the melancholy of the
Northland	LOCATION	.

		The first words of Small Souls are : '' It was pouring with rain , '' the rain in which
Dorine	PERSON	had gone about to collect her brothers and sisters for
Constance	ORGANIZATION	's home coming .

		It was raining at the beginning of
The Twilight of Souls	ORGANIZATION	when Dorine appears to summon Gerrit to
Ernst	ORGANIZATION	's help .

		It was raining when
Constance	PERSON	went to Driebergen to be forgiven by
Henri	PERSON	's dying mother : It had rained steadily for days upon the dreary wintry trees , out of a sky that hung low but tremendously wide and heavy , as oppressive as a pitiless darkness .

		The day was almost black .

		It was three o'clock , but it was night ; and the rain , grey over the road and grey over the , houses and gardens , was black over the misty landscapes which could be dimly descried through the bare gardens .

		The dreary trees looked dead and lived only in the de - spairing gestures of their branches when a wind , howling up from the distance , blew through them and moved them .

		It was mist through which the stricken Gerrit wandered while the worm ate deeper into his back : The clouds seemed to be bending over the town in pity , an immense , yearning pity which turned into a desperate i86 THE DIAL
February 22	DATE	melancholy while Gerrit hurried along with his great strides ; the wintry trees lifted their crowns of branches in melancholy despair ; the rooks cawed and circled in swarms ; the bells of the tram-cars tinkled as though muffled in black crepe ; the few pedestrians walked stiffly and unnaturally ; he met ague-stricken black-clad figures with sinister , spectral faces : they passed him like so many ghosts ; and all around him , in the vistas of the woods , rose a clammy mist in which every outline of houses , trees and people was blurred into a shadowy unreality .

		It is wind and cloud which emphasize the pathos of the humble landscape at the beginning of Dr. Adriaan : The afternoon sky was full of thick dark clouds , drift - ing ponderously grey over almost black violet ; clouds so dark , heavy and thick that they seemed to creep labor - iously upon the east wind , for all that it was blowing hard .

		In its breath the clouds now and again changed their weary outline , before their time came to pour down in heavy straight streaks of rain .

		The stiff pine-woods quivered , erect and anxious , along the road ; and the tops of the trees lost themselves in a silver-grey air hard - ly lighter than the clouds and dissolving far and wide under all that massive grey-violet and purple-black which seemed so close and low .

		The road ran near and went winding past , lonely , deserted and sad .

		It was as though it came winding out of low horizons and went on towards low horizons , dipping humbly under very low skies , and only pine-trees still stood up , pointed , proud and straight , when everything else was stooping .

		The modest villa - residence , the smaller poor dwellings here and there stooped under the heavy sky and the gusty wind ; the shrubs dipped along the roadside ; and the few people who went along an old gentleman ; a peasant-woman ; two poor children carrying a basket and followed by a melancholy , big , rough-coated dog seemed to hang their heads low under the solemn weight of the clouds and the fierce mastery of the wind , which had months ago blown the smile from the now humble , frowning , pensive landscape .

		The soul of that landscape appeared small and all forlorn in the watery mists of the dreary winter .

		It is snow which falls like a pall and marks the bitter peace of the winter of souls .

		Days had come of endless flaking snow ; and the hard frost kept the snow tight-packed in the garden , alongside the house , the silent , massive building whose thick white lines stood out against the low bending snow-laden skies : one great greyness from out of which the grey of the snow fell with a sleepy whirl until it was caught in the grip of the frost and turned white , describing the outlines of villa-houses and the branching silhouettes of black and dreary trees with round soft strokes of white .

		The road in front of the house soon soiled its whiteness with cart - tracks and footprints ; and with the snow there fell from the sky , like so much grey wool , the pale melancholy of a winter in the country , all white decay and white lone - liness : days so short that it seemed as though the slow hours slept and , when awake , but dragged their whiter veils from grey dawn to grey twilight , so that dawn might once again be turned to night .

		And the short days were like white nights , sunless , as though the light were shining through velvet , velvet cold as the breath of death , the breath of death itself , striking down and embracing all things in its chill velvet .

		As the characters appear like musical instruments in an orchestral composition , so such passages as these represent the great bursts of sound of the organ , more frequent and sustained and overwhelm - ing as the finale comes to its close .

		The Small Souls series is not the only example that
Couperus	PERSON	has given us of the family novel .

		In Old People and Things that Pass -LRB- translated by
Alexander Teixeira de Mattos Dodd Mead	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.75	MONEY	-RRB- two characters detach themselves more de - cisively from the background than any in Small Souls , the old grandmother Dercksz , and her lover Takma .

		But these figures are static , fixed as the result of the spell laid on them by their crime ; the action of the story evolves in the learning of this crime by their descendants , and the learning that the others know .

		Slowly and fatally the guilty secret which has been kept for sixty years makes its way until the circle is complete .

		By virtue of this plot the novel is more concentrated than
Small Souls	ORGANIZATION	, and the characters are presented with a bolder outline , physically and spiritually .

		There is no portrait in Small Souls of such definiteness as this of
Anton Dercksz	PERSON	, whose aged sensuality has taken refuge in his mind .

		He grinned , with a broad grin .

		He sat there , big and heavy ; and the folds and dewlaps of his full , yellow-red cheeks thrilled with pleasure at her outburst ; the ends of his grey-yellow moustache stood straight up with merri - ment ; and his eyes with their yellow irises gazed pen - sively at his sister , who had never been of the flesh .

		What had n't she missed , thought
Anton	PERSON	, in scoffing con - tempt , as he sat bending forward .

		His coarse-fisted hands lay like clods on his thick knees ; and the tops of his
Wellington	LOCATION	boots showed round under the trouser-legs .

		His waistcoast was undone ; so were the two top buttons of his trousers , and
Stefanie	PERSON	could just see his braces .

		On the other hand the natural background is en - tirely suppressed .

		Once more a single family is sufficient to itself except Takma almost the only intruder is Dr.
Roelofsz	PERSON	, .

		and he by sharing the knowledge of the crime has likewise shared in the love of the woman who inspired it .

		Again through a single family we gain a vivid impression of Dutch life , its local concentration varied by a sterile cosmo - politianism
Therese	PERSON	, one of the daughters , is a nun at
Paris	LOCATION	;
Ottilie	PERSON	, a granddaughter , lives with her Italian lover at Nice .

		As in Small Souls the structure is musical the variations of the theme of antique crime as it is sounded in the characters , quavering in the strings , sobbing and groaning in the winds and brasses ; with passages of tender joy as where the great great grandmother em - braces the babies , the fourth generation of her body alternating with those of horror when she sees with her terrible second sight the form of her mur - dered husband .

		That
Couperus	PERSON	should have solved so completely the artistic problem of the family novel in the four books of Small Souls is a wonder - ful achievement : that he should have repeated the performance in a single volume marks him as a technician of the highest power a virtuoso .

		ROBERT
MORSS LOVETT	ORGANIZATION	.

		1919 THE DIAL 187 The League and the Instinct for Competition 1 N A MOMENT of relaxation , and distinctly not for publication , a well-known defender of corporations from the
Sherman Anti-Trust Law	ORGANIZATION	said to me re - cently : `` I have come at last , after ten years of fighting it , to perceive that the Sherman Law repre - sents a more or less permanent instinct in the com - mon run of American people .

		I do not believe it will ever be repealed , and I believe it is hopeless to fight it . ''

		Occasional appearances before
Congres	PERSON	- sional Committees , the
Federal Trade Commission	ORGANIZATION	, and other bodies to debate matters involving the principles of competition have given me inklings of the truth and profundity of this opinion .

		The mass of men are combative and competitive in instinct , and they distrust and fear any and all combinations , even government centralization of power .

		They feel safest when they buy from small competitors vying with each other ; they revel in contest in all matters political and commercial ; in athletics and in love .

		The very doom of autocracy consists to a certain extent in its fixity and lack of contest .

		There are no excitements in
America	LOCATION	equal to those in - spired by four typical competitions a presidential election , business , baseball , and until recent years the pugilistic championship .

		The cockfight and counter revolutions in
Mexico	LOCATION	, bullfights in
Spain	LOCATION	, politics in
England	LOCATION	, bristling war preparation and economic penetration in
Germany	LOCATION	these have been elemental competitive matters closest to the common heart .

		Average mankind adores competition ; is un - easy without it ; hugs it , indeed , with almost the love of a tippler for his flask !

		America is very especially addicted to competi - tion , because of its individualistic traditions .

		The feud and turmoil between politics and ` business in the past twenty years have been due largely , I verily believe , to the collision between the inveterate in - stinct for competition on the part of the common people and the natural tendency of brains to appre - ciate cooperation and combination .

		There is no immediate .

		hope that
America	LOCATION	will change greatly in this respect , nor is there any indication that com - petition between nations after the war will be less than before the war .

		On the contrary there are many signs of a strongly renascent nationalism .

		It is well , therefore , to introduce a note of caution in the high hopes of idealists and intellectuals for approaching a millennium through the gateway of a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	or after-the-war reconstruction .

		There is an impending tragedy in the develop - ment now growing before our eyes the sharpening up of the instinct for competition among nations .

		Even though it is now economic instead of military , already it is compressing seriously the idealistic hopes for the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	.

		Every European country , great and small , is literally `` on its toes '' with economic ambition made all the more for - midable by a national integration heightened enor - mously by the war .

		There are going to be a great many disappointed intellectuals everywhere , even under the most favorable outcome , because the new nationalistic aspirations , freed and stimulated by the passing of autocracy , turn instinctively to economic contest , to economic self-determination .

		In a com - petition between instinct and brains , popular instinct will inevitably be the master , since in a democracy it usually gets its way .

		And that popular instinct for competition is not ready , I fear , for the national - istic sacrifices necessary for an economically inte - grated world for competitions of a more sublimated kind .

		As a matter of fact it may safely be predicted that the intelligent constructive minds of the world , in their work for a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	of broad scope inclusive of the all-important economic ele - ments , will now run up against a veritable unwritten Sherman Anti-Trust Law among the peoples of the world .

		In other words , the universal human in - stinct for competition and against organized com - binations will very likely stubbornly balk the forma - tion of what might be the great master combination of all history , in the same manner and for the same reasons that the antiquated and stupid Sherman Law has balked wise and honest combination in
America	LOCATION	.

		The common run of people and nations do not believe what they do not see ; do not trust organiza - tions because they are abstract .

		Only the Germans , with their genius for abstraction , could thoroughly visualize even the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		It has taken the war to teach other countries nationalism .

		And , though it has also taught some internationalism , it is without the same enthusiasm .

		The individual whether man or nation remains the most dramatic and effective unit on the stage of consciousness , because the common man knows how an individual feels and moves and does .

		A great corporation is a logarithmic abstraction to the common intelligence , hated and distrusted because it is both superhuman and often inhuman .

		A
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	will be a veritable fourth dimension conception to the aver - age mind , and whatever part of its logical scope and outline will finally be agreed upon will need desper - ately to be `` sold '' and kept `` sold '' continuously to the people of the world if it is not to suffer the i88 THE DIAL
February 22	DATE	disaster of innocuous desuetude or worse .

		Strong counteracting efforts will be necessary to remove the curse of abstraction from such a League and give it some of the strength arising from competitive in - centives .

		The streams of competition are already racing through the national sluiceways with a swirl that will rise to a roar of elemental power as soon as all the dams of war ` are removed .

		This most for - midable commercial and industrial nationalism , which is mobilizing itself within all such nations as have remaining any mobilizing power whatever , must now , if ever , be led toward constructive inter - national competitions .

		The present policy of individual nations is essen - tially one of economic self-determination , or as our
Department of Commerce	ORGANIZATION	reports it the word in itself is a condemnation `` economic self - sufficiency . ''

		As such it represents virtually a nationalistic prep - aration for economic battle ; represents a conviction that nations must hereafter be not more , but less , dependent upon any other nation or group of nations .

		Never again , such nations virtually proclaim , shall we be surprised in a condition of dependence upon other nations for vital `` key '' products .

		Social cost and international efficiency and logical subdivision of world tasks are as nothing in this intense national - istic view .

		Except that it is economic , the spirit of this resolve is nevertheless militaristic in principle , even though purely defensive .

		It is flatly antag - onistic in spirit to the principle of a
World State	ORGANIZATION	and disarmament , and as such breathes the same old instinct for competition ; comprises , in unwritten essence , a universal Sherman Anti-Trust Law stand - ing in the way of a real
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	.

		It amounts to the substitution of economic armament for military armament .

		It is doubly formidable , and - withal contradictory , in that it aims to use the powerful tool of internal combination to attain nationalism following the plan of German state-fostered combinations for com - peting with other nations .

		England is earnestly urging her industries to combine as a national unit to meet the foreign competitor , saying that
England	LOCATION	's industries , disunited , can not meet world competition , but united , can .

		We thus have combination along national lines to combat other national or inter - national combinations an infinitely more effective trigger for war explosions than disorganized indi - vidual competition , because it represents industrial mobilization of nations for international aggression .

		State-fostered as such effort must necessarily be , it will virtually duplicate the old
Germany	LOCATION	in spiritual principle , and invite fatal trials of strength .

		The struggle for existence has always been three - fold : -LRB- 1 -RRB- struggle between individuals of the same race or nation ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- struggle with other races or nations ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- struggle against conditions of life .

		The war has knit individual nations and races into amicable , effective units as never before .

		Can now this new and vivid sense of economic self-determina - tion and economic rivalry among individual nations and races be carried upward and diverted to the international ends of a logical
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	for universal amelioration of conditions of life , in - stead of wasteful competition between groups ?

		It is indeed doubtful .

		Even amidst the most earnest co - operation of nations for war and under dire necessity , the nationalistic feelings , prides , pre - judices , and jealous self - consciousness of the various nations have at least unmistakably indi - cated their presence , even if not obstructively .

		The one pivotal decision of the war unity of military command was almost fatally delayed by this instinct for competition , this distrust of combination .

		He is a bold man who will predict that with the weight of war once off his chest , the average man 's instinct will not again take him to his tipple , his delusion of competition , which cares much less for efficiency and logic and wise equilib - rium than for a good fight .

		-LRB-
Fabre	PERSON	has abundantly proved how little instinct has to do with reason . -RRB-

		The fact that he is sick of bayonet and gunpowder battle does not make him any the less keen for battle of goods and markets and price ; in fact , by contrast , it has made him very especially keen for it not real - izing in his fatuity that he may merely make certain another round of the old , old human savagery .

		The
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	must be made successful much after the manner of any great organization by the use of rivalry and enthusiasm for common ends , kept skilfully in sight ; by the most minute tech - nical pains and coordinative ability .

		It must produce something which the common man wants , and lose no opportunity to advertise itself to him in terms he can understand .

		It is with no disrespect either to the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	or to business a business proposition , pure and simple .

		It must enter very prosaically into the workaday endeavors of nations and show them its specific advantages in even a salesmanlike manner .

		It was with some such com - bination of vision , optimism , and practicality that
Morgan	PERSON	, after
Carnegie	ORGANIZATION	announced his vigorous competitive program , showed the steel industry the value of combining , by chart , statistic , hard sense , practical program and showed also a clear picture of the disintegrating alternatives .

		The
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	must become part of the daily desk and bench labors of man or remain merely a trailing cloud of intellectual glory .

		J.
GEORGE FREDERICK	PERSON	.

		THE DIAL 189 Possessor and Possessed T J.H .

		HE WORK OF Mr.
John Gould	PERSON	``
Fletcher	PERSON	has hardly attained the eminence in contemporary poetry that it deserves .

		One is doubtful , indeed , whether it will .

		For not only is it of that sort which in - evitably attracts only a small audience , but it is also singularly uneven in quality , and many readers who would like Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	at his best can not muster the patience to read beyond his worst .

		Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	is his own implacable enemy .

		He has not yet published a book in which his excellent qualities are single , candid , and undivided : a great many dead leaves are always to be turned .

		The reward for the search is conspicuous , but unfortunately it is one which few will take the trouble to find .

		Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	's latest book , The Tree of Life -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- is no exception to this rule : it is perhaps , if we leave out of account his five early books of orthodox and nugatory self-exploration , the most remarkably uneven of them all .

		It has neither the level technical excellence , the economical terseness of his Japanese Prints , nor , on the other hand , the amazing flight of many pages in Goblins and Pagodas .

		Yet certainly one would rather have it than Japanese Prints ; and even if it contains a greater proportion of dross than is to be found in the symphonies , it has compensating qualities , quali - ties which one feels are new in the work of Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	, and which make one hesitate to rate it too far below Goblins and Pagodas , or , at any rate .

		Irradiations .

		For the moment , however , it is in - teresting to set aside these new qualities and to consider , or savor , the astonishing unequalness which alone would constitute a sort of distinction in the work of Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	.

		It is the custom in such cases to say that the '' poet has no self-critical faculty , and to let it go at that .

		But that explana - tion is of a general and vague character , and operates only under the fallacy that any such com - plex is reducible to the terms of a single factor .

		It should be clear that any given complex will consist of several factors ; that '' absence of a critical facul - ty '' is to a considerable degree a merely negative diagnosis ; and that perhaps one would wisely look for a more express clue to the particular personal equation in something more positive as for example in some excess rather than lack .

		It is in a kind of redundancy , on the psychic plane , that an artist 's character is most manifest .

		Here will lie the key to both his successes and his failures .

		It should be the critic 's undertaking to name and analyze this redundancy and to ascertain the degree in which the artist has it under control .

		Unfortunately , this undertaking , in the present state of psychology and criticism is a branch of psychology is as yet highly speculative ; it borders , indeed , in the opinion of many , on the mythological .

		Criticism of this sort must be , confessedly , supposi - titious .

		Thus in the case of Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	we shall perhaps find the most suggestive light cast from a direction which to many literary folk is highly suspect from psychology itself .

		Kostyleff , it will be recalled , maintains that a very important part of the mechanism of poetic inspiration rests in the automatic discharge of verbal reflexes the initial impulse coming from some external stimulus , but the chain of verbal association thereafter unraveling more or less of its own momentum , and leading , as far as any connection of thought or emotion is con - cerned , well beyond the premises of the original stimulus .

		Of course
Kostyleff	PERSON	does not limit him - self to this .

		He grants that it is only a peculiar sensibility which will store up , as in the case of a poet , such a wealth of verbal reflexes : and he grants further that there is often though not always the initial stimulus from without .

		For our part , as soon as we apply this engaging theory to the work of poets , we see that certain aspects of it are more illuminating in some cases than others ; in other words , that while the principle as a whole is true of all poets , in some poets it is one factor which is more important , and in some another .

		It is true , for example , that Mr. ,
Fletcher	PERSON	has a very original sensibility , and it is also true that his initial stimulus sometimes comes from without , but whereas in the work of certain other poets these factors might be paramount , in the case of Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	the striking feature has always been his habit of surrendering himself , almost completely , to the power of these automatically unraveling verbal reflexes .

		In fact the poetry of Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	is as remarkable an il - lustration of this principle as one could find .

		The implications are rich .

		What occurs to one immediately is that , as the functioning of these verbal reflexes is most rapid when least consciously controlled , the poet will be at his best when the initial stimulus is of a nature to leave hirn greatest freedom .

		To such a poet , it will be seen , it would be a great handicap to have to adhere too closely , throughout a longish poem , to a fixed and unalter - able idea .

		The best theme for him will be the one which is least definite , one which will start him off at top speed but will be rather enhanced than im - paired by the introduction and development of new elements , by rapid successive improvisations in un - 190 THE DIAL
February 22	DATE	foreseen directions .

		Any sort of conceptual frame - work prepared in advance with regard either to subject or form would be perpetually retarding him , perpetually bringing him back to a more severely conscious plane of effort , a plane on which , the chances are , he would be far less effective .

		These suppositions gain force when we turn , in their light , to Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	's work .

		In Irradiations w r e find him taking his first ecstatic plunge into improvisa - tion formalism is thrown to the winds , and with it much which for this poet perplexes and retards ; and an amazingly rich treasure house of verbal reflexes , the gift of a temperament almost hyper - '' esthetic in its sensitiveness to color , line , and tex - ture a temperament in which some profound dis - harmony is most easily struck at and shaken through these senses is for the first time rifled .

		It is in this stage of a lyric poet 's career that his speech most glistens .

		Impressions come up shining from their long burial in the subconscious .

		The poet is per - haps a little breathless with his sudden wealth he is at first content to bring up only small handfuls of the most glittering coin ; he is even perhaps a little distrustful of it .

		But the habit of allowing himself to be possessed by this wealth grows rapidly .

		The mechanism becomes more familiar , if anything so vague as this kind of apperception can be said to be truly recognizable , and the poet learns the trick of shutting his eyes and not merely allowing , but precisely inviting , his subconscious to take possession of him .

		The trick consists largely in a knowledge , abruptly acquired , of his own character , and of such ideas as are , therefore , the '' Open Sesame ! ''

		to this cave .

		It was in colorism that Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	found this password .

		And it was in Goblins and Pagodas that he first put it to full and gorgeous use .

		For in the idea of a series of symphonies in which the sole unity was to be a harmony of color , in which form and emotional tone could follow the lead of coloristic word-associations no matter how far afield , Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	discovered an '' Open Sesame ! ''

		so ideal to his nature , and so powerful , as not merely to open the door , but at one stroke to lay bare his treasure entire .

		One should not over - look here also an important secondary element in Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	's nature , a strong but partial affinity for musical construction , a feeling for powerful submerged rhythms less ordered than those of metrical verse , but more ordered than those of prose ; and this element , too , found its ideal oppor - tunity in the color symphonies .

		The result was , naturally , the most brilliant and powerful work which Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	has yet given us a poetry unlike any other .

		It contains no thought : Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	is not a conceptual poet .

		It contains , in the strictly human sense , extraordinarily little of the sort of emotion which relates to the daily life of men and women ; there are despairs and exaltations and sorrows and hopes , and the furious energy of ambition , and the weariness of resignation , but they are the emotions of someone incorporeal , and their sphere of action is among winds and clouds , the colors of sky and sea , the glittering of rain and jewels ; and not among the perplexed hearts of humanity .

		In a sense it is like the symbolism of such poets as Mallarme , but with the difference that here the symbols have no meaning .

		It is a sort of absolute poetry , a poetry of detached waver and brilliance , a beautiful flowering of language alone , a parthenogenesis , as if language were fertilized by itself rather than by thought or feeling .

		Remove the magic of phrase and sound , and there is nothing left : no thread of continuity , no relation between one page and the next , no thought , no story , no emotion .

		But the magic of phrase and sound is powerful , and it takes one into a fantastic world where one is etherealized , where one has deep emo - tions , indeed , but emotions star-powdered , and blown to flame by speed and intensity rather than by thought or human warmth .

		Unfortunately it is only for a little while that a poet can be so completely possessed by the subcon - scious : the more complete the possession the more rapid the exhaustion .

		One or two of Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	's color symphonies showed already a v flagging of energy , and in addition to the unevenness which is inevitable in a blind obedience to the lead of word - association alone -LRB- since it leads as often to verbosity as to magic -RRB- that unevenness also is noticed which comes of the poet 's attempt to substitute the con - sciously for the unconsciously found an attempt which for such a temperament as Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	's is frequently doomed to failure .

		There are limits , moreover , as we have seen , to the number of themes which will draw out the best of the possessed type of poet .

		Failing to discover new themes , he must repeat the old ones ; and here it is not long before he feels his consciousness intruding , and saying to him , '' You have said this before , '' a consciousness which at once inhibits the unraveling of word-asso - ciation , and brings him back to that more deliberate sort of art for which he is not so well fitted .

		It is to this point that Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	has come , recently in Japanese Prints , and now in
The Tree of Life	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here and there for a moment is a flash of magic and power there are pages , even whole poems , which are only less delightful than the symphonies but intermingled with how much that is lame , stiltedly metrical , verbose , or downright ugly .

		The use of regular meter or rhyme brings him down with
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 191 a thud ... The Tree of Life is a volume of love poems , more personal than Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	has given us hitherto , and that has an interest of its own .

		But the colorism has begun to dim , it is often merely a wordy and tediously overcrowded imitation of the colored swiftness of Goblins and Pagodas , the images indistinct and conflicting ; and if one is to hope fpr further brilliance it is not in this but in a new note , audible here and there in the shorter lyrics , a note of ironlike resonance , bitterly per - sonal , and written in a free verse akin to the stark eloquence of Biblical prose ... Are these lyrics an earnest of further development , and will Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	pass to that other plane of art , that of the possessor artist , the artist who foresees and forges , who calculates his effects ?

		There is hardly enough evidence here to make one sure .

		CONRAD
AIKEN	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Significance of Redon _ i ` HEN THE WORK of
Odilon Redon	PERSON	was first shown in this country , at the
International Exhibi	ORGANIZATION	- tion of
1913	DATE	, its success was immediate and , beyond a doubt , more complete than that of any other artist represented in the epoch-making show .

		There was naturally more of popular discussion about the Cubists and others whose work seemed revolution - ary , but the man who came in ` for most admiration more even than was given to
Cezanne	ORGANIZATION	was Redon .

		Should we see in this merely a sign that the artist had something which the American public demands , through the nature of its preferences ?

		I think not ; twenty years earlier his reception here would have been different , as it was different in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Only in the last ten or fifteen years has there been anything like a solid appreciation of Redon anywhere , and his success here was not a question of place but of time .

		Indeed the fact is that in a number of European countries the recog - nition of his genius was coming about , more and more positively , in the decade before the exhibition here .

		It was late in coming , among laymen at least , for Redon was born in
1840	DATE	and the time when he had made clear the bearing of his art may easily be placed before his thirtieth year .

		With an exhibition of Redon 's etchings and lithographs be - fore us again -LRB- at the
Ehrich Print Gallery	ORGANIZATION	, until
March 12	DATE	-RRB- it seems incomprehensible that his fame does not date back fifty years , but the world is probably no more interested in living genius now than it was then .

		Artists were naturally the first to recognize his importance , but even among them it was long before the major quality in his art was understood .

		For there are in Redon the two phases which we find in every master the qualities of idea and of form .

		The first generation which turned to Redon for guidance the men who began to play a role in art about
1890	DATE	were followers or successors of the Impressionists who had come to see that
Cezanne	PERSON	with his infinite world of form ,
Gauguin	PERSON	with his startling design and
Van Gogh	PERSON	with his intensity of expression had given a new turn to the line of art development .

		If they did not see
Redon	PERSON	's full importance , it was because they were content to skim the surface of their elders ' production and to draw from it the elements of a merely decorative art , agreeable but light .

		They did see in him the colorist and designer , and much that is good in the work of
Bonnard	LOCATION	,
Roussel	PERSON	, and numerous minor artists is to be traced to Redon .

		Of the same generation , but of a far deeper talent and mind ,
Matisse	ORGANIZATION	consulted Redon to better pur - pose .

		Not only was his native gift of color enriched by contact with the rare opulence of Redon , but the quality of significance which lifts him above his contemporaries was intensified by his study of the older man .

		Redon , while always glad to receive the visits of young artists and to give them advice , never undertook teaching in a school .

		The teacher who most nearly approached him in ideals -LRB- though far from approaching in his results the plane of Redon -RRB- was
Gustave Moreau	PERSON	, and it was from
Moreau	PERSON	that
Matisse	PERSON	had his most important les - sons .

		Another student at the atelier , whose later achievement has been admirable , was
Georges Rouault	PERSON	.

		The preoccupation of both men with the problem of expression is proof of their ad - herence to that art of the idea of which Redon is the chief exemplar in the whole
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	.

		But it is the group which appeared after these men which goes deepest into the significance of Redon .

		A few years ago there was exhibited in this city a sheet of drawings by
Picasso	ORGANIZATION	in which that surprising person gave imitations of four of the older artists unmistakable by themselves , but on each of which he wrote the name of the man in whose manner the sketch was made .

		One of them was Redon .

		And what has Cubism to do with the old sage who invented for us this mythology , ancient and modern , these grand illustrations for
The Temptation of Saint Anthony	ORGANIZATION	and of the Apocalypse , this recounter of dreams who portrays 192 THE DIAL
February 22	DATE	for us with equal sureness the
Buddha	ORGANIZATION	, a bunch of flowers , or the Spanish guitarist who has delighted him the evening before ?

		On the surface ,
Redon	PERSON	's art and the art of the men but halfway described by their surname of Cubists have little or nothing in common .

		Indeed the geometrical side of Cubism is in strong contrast with the spontaneous , impro - vising quality so apparent in the work of Redon .

		He himself felt this and spoke in gentle distrust of a theoretical method of procedure in art .

		But he also understood the other side of the new school and was well pleased with its homage .

		The man whose work proclaims most unequivocally the latter-day attitude toward art as an expression of what takes place in the world of the mind ,
Marcel Duchamp	PERSON	, is also the man of the new generation who most frankly acknowledges his debt to Redon .

		In the essentials of the question , then , there is a close bond between the master whose works are before us an 'd the advance guard who have so far departed from his external forms .

		Together they continue the line of those who tell us that art is not '' homo additus naturae , '' but a pure expression of the purpose of man through his joy in form and color the '' natura '' v of
Bacon	LOCATION	entering into the operation only in so far as it is useful as a means .

		A part of the reason why it has taken long for the world to see the greatness of Redon is , as I have shown , that the artists took long .

		For it is often through the inheritors or even the vulgarizers of a creative work that the mass of men come to know its quality .

		But another reason is that
Redon	PERSON	was really that unusual being , the man ahead of his time .

		It is only a thoughtless use of the phrase that applies it to artists like
Delacroix	LOCATION	,
Courbet	LOCATION	, or
Cezanne	ORGANIZATION	.

		They are of their time , not ahead of it , the violent opposition they had to face having been only a natural reaction on the part of the mediocre mob w r hich resented being dragged from its com - fortable wallowing in the refuse of the past .

		Among the leaders ,
Cezanne	ORGANIZATION	and all the great Im - pressionists -LRB- save
Pissarro	PERSON	-RRB- were born within a year of one another and of Redon .

		The former group dominates the years from
1870	DATE	to
1900	DATE	.

		Redon be - gins to emerge only about the end of that period , as a man of sixty , with a great work behind him and , most fortunately , with sixteen years of glorious production still before him .

		He was clear in his own mind about the differ - ences between himself and his contemporaries , as we see in some notes of
1913	DATE	, in which he tells of a friend and preceptor of his youth , the fine artist
Rodophe Bresdin	PERSON	: He said to me once , in a tone of gentle authority : '' Look at that chimney ; what does it tell you ?

		To me it re - counts a legend .

		If you have the strength to observe it well and to comprehend it , imagine the strangest , the most bizarre subject , if it is well based and if it remains within the limits of that simple stretch of .

		wall , your dream will be living .

		Therein lies art . ''

		Bresdin made these re - marks in
1864	DATE	.

		I note the date because it was not thus that art was taught at that time .

		The artists of my generation , for the most part , -LSB- and he does not mean the masters -RSB- , have assuredly considered the chimney .

		And they have seen nothing but the chim - ney .

		All that can be added to the stretch of wall through the mirage of our personal essence has not been rendered by them .

		Everything that passes beyond , illumines or amplifies the object , and lifts the mind into the region of mystery , into the trouble of the irresolute and of its de - licious unrest , has been totally closed to them .

		Everything which lends to the symbol , everything which our art holds of the unexpected , of the unprecise , of the undefinable , and which gives it an aspect which borders on the enigma they have hidden from it , they have feared it .

		True para - sites of the object , they have developed art in the visual field alone , and have to some extent closed it off from that which passes beyond and could bring into the humblest essays , even into the blacks , the light of spirituality .

		I mean an irradiation which takes hold of our spirit , and which escapes all analysis .

		In the half century between
Bresdin	PERSON	's remarks and
Redon	PERSON	's development of them a change took place in the world 's mind , and there is every sign that the present era will not accept the ever-present '' parasites of the object '' as its representatives .

		It is turning to
Redon	PERSON	and the others who '' depassent 1 ` objet '' with more and more understanding and cer - tainty .

		He speaks with emphasis in the passage I have cited , but it must not be thought that his habitual mood was one of criticism .

		On the con - trary it was one of faith in the world , of confidence that there were always certain persons who saw be - yond the object to its new form after assimilation by the mind , and who were thus ready to delight in the new form when an artist makes it visible by his line and color .

		The fact that his belief was justified , that the number of these persons is increasing , is the final reply to those shallow critics of the modern world who cry '' materialism '' because the forms of art change with time and because we are no longer working with Greek or Gothic models .

		Redon 's family life was extremely happy and his work went on steadily from year to year , with friends am6ngst the great painters , poets and musi - cians of his time to give him the encouraging ap - plause that every artist should have .

		But the extent of his good fortune did not hide from his clear eyes the fact that art appreciation , in a time at all similar to ours , must be looked for amongst few people .

		And he knew that when the understanding for his art of the inner world came , it would have about it nothing definitive .

		His great wish was that the young men go on to their own work , provided only that it be well pondered and the result of genuine need .

		Late in life he once declared himself ready to forget all he had done and essay a totally different style , if an experience befell him which rendered
1919	DATE	THE DIAL such a change necessary .

		It was with a ring of conviction in his power to go on to new things that he spoke the words .

		And this openness which had in it humility and pride at once was one of the marks by which one can recognize him as the seer of latent forces in his own time and the prophet of their expansion in the time ahead .

		With all there is of change in men 's attitude toward art , one feels that some underlying principles remain , in whatever form they may be embodied .

		One feels that the light Redon has thrown for us on the relation of the object to the mind , the mind to art , must remain clear , and will be handed on while our civilization lasts .

		If his work is not the last word in exemplifying the truth , we may rejoice in the vitality of the later generation which owes him so much .

		Before his own work in the present exhibition we have the pleasure of saluting an elder who does not grow old .

		The magical sonorous gradations of black and white thrill us only the more deeply as we see them again : the powerful , elusive , unprecedented forms find unsuspected cor - respondence in our own minds , and they are clothed with an always more intense and permanent reality .


WALTER PACH	PERSON	.

		The Theory of Fiction A HERE ARE at least three standpoints or three levels from which the field of fiction may be viewed : you may range over it while on its own level ; you may take it from aloft the bird 's - eye view ; or you may take it from below from the standpoint which gives what has been called , in - geniously and felicitously , the '' worm 's - eye view . ''

		The first of these is the ordinary way of the novelist himself : with his feet on the ground and his head in the air , he takes his chances along the various heights and hollows .

		The second , the bird 's - eye view , is that of Mr.
Wilson Follett	PERSON	.

		The third , the worm 's - eye view , is , with some shiftings and modifications , that of Mr.
Clayton Hamilton	PERSON	.

		In The Modern Novel -LRB- Knopf ;
$ 2	MONEY	-RRB- Mr.
Follett	PERSON	is very much aloft indeed .

		He whirs and sweeps , aviator-like , through the thin , keen air of theory , and indulges frequent apergus which take in the vague groundlings that toil far below .

		One wishes that he would come down to earth and try a little fiction on his own account .

		He might find the fabrication of two or three short stories worth a manual to him , and the consummation of a full-sized novel to outweigh an encyclopedia .

		For here , as in last year 's Some Modern Novelists , he is obsessed , even borne down , by the sense of the novelist 's accountability : the writing of fiction is a serious social function . ''

		You are responsible , '' he seems to say through every page ; '' so see that you are honest and earnest and right . ''

		Joy in the swarming human scene counts for little , the com - fortable satisfaction is the self-expression for less , and exhilaration from the mastering and shaping of material for almost nothing . ''

		Be , '' he seems to adjure the novelist , '' be a responsible , sober-minded agent .

		How else can we take you seriously ?

		How else can we hold ourselves in contenance while we are writing serious books about you ? ''

		Yes , Mr.
Follett	PERSON	has chosen the ether rather than the clod , and he evades the concrete as long as possi - ble .

		He prides himself , in his preface , on his suc - cessful suppression of the word '' psychology . ''

		One begins to ask , presently , whether he is intending to suppress , in addition , the words form , tone , color , and the like .

		On page 199 there is a false dawn , and the silhouettes of '' form '' and '' selection '' ap - pear briefly on the pale horizon ; but full daylight is really deferred until his penultimate chapter on Design .

		This part of the book contains the most of interest for the practical fictionist .

		Here we come upon the novel in metamorphosis ; it is slough - ing off its ancient , cumbrous skin and is emerging into the trim compactness desired by
this later day	TIME	.

		Here too comes in belated cognizance of
France	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	.

		The wonder is that anybody could live so long on Fielding and
Richardson	PERSON	before getting to
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	and
Turgenev	ORGANIZATION	.

		Some Modern Novelists , though cluttered with small anxieties , was not professorial .

		The Modern Novel is .

		Not by reason of its notes , its bibli - ography , its hints for study , but rather through a growing tendency to jargonize .

		The '' School of Terror , '' '' unofficial sentimentalism , '' and even '' the realistic spirit '' may be mentioned too fre - quently and leaned upon too heavily .

		And there is always the risk that a man who is churning and rechurning limited material may jargonize not only his diction but his thought .

		Mr.
Hamilton	PERSON	, in A Manual of the Art of
Fic	ORGANIZATION	- tion -LRB-
Doubleday	ORGANIZATION	, Page ;
$ 1.60	MONEY	-RRB- , does not take to the blue empyrean ; he remains strictly below , among the definite substrata .

		He burrows thor - oughly and faithfully .

		He accomplishes a good amount of serviceable earthwork and helps ventilate and rearrange the general soil .

		His book is really a recasting of Materials and
Methods of Fiction	ORGANIZATION	, 194 THE DIAL
February 22	DATE	which appeared some ten years ago .

		Indeed , his very index `` dates '' him : Kipling ,
Stevenson	PERSON	, and
Poe	PERSON	are his biggest items , and
George Eliot	PERSON	has her good ten lines .

		He states in plain , sensible , ship - shape fashion a good many things that nobody will now dispute things that have been threshed out and have reached the safe bin of the handbook .

		He leans somewhat upon Professor
Brander Matthews	PERSON	, who adds a paragraph to his introduc - tion for the earlier edition , and who contributes his theory of the short-story -LRB- with its hyphen -RRB- .

		Review Questions and Suggested Readings make the book obviously a '' manual '' indeed , and tend to sober the flighty romancer .

		Professor
Matthews	PERSON	looms large , of course , along with Mr.
Bliss Perry	PERSON	, in the chapter which deals with the art of fiction as in - fluenced by the element of length : the paragraphs on the roman and the nouvelle -LRB- in English the '' novel '' and the '' novelette '' -RRB- have their interest in a day when literary molds are in the remaking .

		Mr.
Hamilton	PERSON	, stepping a little to one side of his cathedra , notes toward his end -LRB- and perhaps a trifle mournfully -RRB- that '' as far as the general reader is concerned , the appeal of any work of fiction depends far more upon its content than upon its form . ''

		One who happens to believe that , for the .

		arts in general , form remains the one great sine qua non may fancy , if he choose , that this species of recal - citrance is exhibited chiefly toward such of the arts as require for apprehension the element of time and the governance of consecutivity ; works of architec - ture , painting , and sculpture , being observable at a mere glance , do not delay and embarrass us as we try to take in their general scope ; it is the works which unfold or unroll the epic , the drama , the symphony , the novel that run the chance of hav - ing their form missed while their content comes uppermost .

		Yet we recall that most paintings in - terest the rank and file through the subject rather than through the technique ; and that , per contra , a play which does not shape itself as it ought to sends the spectator out dissatisfied .

		It may be all one can say is this : that the more restricted the work of art the greater the chance that its form , construction , and technique may be satisfactorily apprehended by the laity .

		Such apprehension is an intelligible and intelligent pleasure , and ought to be promoted .

		Delimitation makes the novel easier to compass , both for writer and reader .

		Mr.
Follett	PERSON	, in the most arresting of his chapters , notes the disposition of the French '' to exhaust the possibilities of order , symmetry , and austere per - fection , '' and '' to achieve unity by whittling down their subjects to essentials '' ; and he contrasts them with the Russians , who run to an '' inclusiveness of matter and of event '' like that of the Victorians , '' which is our chief tradition in the novel '' a kind of continental welter , in fact , which leaves us where we were in the matter of clear and well - proportioned design .

		Mr.
Follett	PERSON	sees the new novel , whatever its length , as a sublimated short story .

		It '' avails itself of the novel 's fulness of treatment ; it may run to any length , even the in - ordinate length of the Victorian novels . ''

		However , '' its theme is single , and it aims at rigid unity of effect the unity which comes from one direction inexorably followed , and the use of all the material to illustrate a single principle .

		... It is the short story under a microscope , the short story on a vastly enlarged scale . ''

		He is thus quite at variance with such men of yesterday as Mr.
Matthews	PERSON	, Mr.
Hamilton	PERSON	, and Mr.
Perry	PERSON	, who believe that a short story can be poised successfully on but one or two of the several bases required by a novel .

		For plot or situation alone may suffice ; or characterization alone ; or , in special instances , even setting alone .

		Further , the short story may pose problems without answering them , may operate on highly arbitrary premises , may create beauty out of the horrible , may indulge a poetic symbolism , and may make other excursions denied the novel , whether long or short .

		Thus one may find no great reason for following Mr.
Follett	PERSON	when he telescopes the novel and the short story and squeezes out the novelette alto - gether ; yet there is a growing sense that unity and conciseness , under whatever categories , are better worth striving for than was once thought .

		The future appears to be for the shorter form which has been employed now and then by
Henry James	PERSON	and
Edith Wharton	PERSON	, and which indeed was employed as far back as
1840	DATE	-LRB- for the French are usually first in the field -RRB- by
Merimee	PERSON	in his
Colomba	LOCATION	; the form which , within the past year or two , has produced
Swinnerton	PERSON	's Nocturne ,
Rebecca West	PERSON	's The Re - turn of the Soldier , and , within slightly wider limits ,
Joseph Hergesheimer	PERSON	's
Java Head	LOCATION	.

		The technique of this latter , wherein the author works out his own problem through independent and rather self-willed and overconfident endeavor , is far from perfect , but is most suggestive and instructive .

		It helps point out the new , indubitable road .

		If novel-writing , as Mr.
Follett	PERSON	insists , is a responsible social function , novel-reading has its obligations too .

		A cultivation of the sense of form and proportion ought to add to the reader 's pleasure , and even to discipline him , in a measure , for the general conduct of life .

		A burden shared becomes less onerous .


HENRY B. FULLER	PERSON	.

		igig THE DIAL
London	LOCATION	,
January 30	DATE	XA FEW DAYS AGO I asked an editor of my acquaint - ance what were his plans for the reconstruction of his magazine when increased supplies of paper should make it possible . ''

		That , '' he replied with impres - sive gravity , '' depends on the effect which the result of the election has on literature . ''

		I do not know precisely what effect he apprehended ; I had n't , in fact , the courage to ask him .

		He may have been looking forward ' to the suppression of every periodi - cal that does not sing the praise of our great and noble Prime Minister in the loudest possible strains ; or he may merely have envisaged the imposition of a prohibitive tax on pure letters .

		Those whose inter - ests are not bound up with the interest of '' big busi - ness '' are looking rather gloomily to the future and are preparing themselves for any smashing blow which the new state of affairs may casually deal them in passing .

		But I am not apprehensive for literature myself .

		It is a matter apart from politics it rarely penetrates to the utterance of politicians ; and au - thors , editors , and publishers , as such , are not greatly concerned with affairs of state or the gyrations of statesmen .

		It does occasionally happen that legisla - tion affects us .

		At Christmas time I met a pub - lisher in the country , w -RRB- io told me that he had serious thoughts of going up to
London	LOCATION	the next day and assassinating Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	.

		He had no particular grudge against your President ; but , at the moment , he disliked your country intensely .

		An American publisher had just written to him , proposing to issue an American edition of one of his books and offering him a royalty of ten per cent , on condition that he abstained from selling his own edition in
America	LOCATION	.

		But irritation over the copyright laws does not often rise to this pitch ; and , though we have a grievance to be redressed , we do not expect to be considered at the
Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	or in the
House of Com	ORGANIZATION	- mons .

		The main effect of the election , so far as I can see , will be to reduce even further -LRB- and
Heaven	ORGANIZATION	knows it was low enough -RRB- the literary level of
Parlia	LOCATION	- mentary speeches .

		There were not many men in the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	who were capable of stand - ing up and talking good , dignified English ; and our electorate has now rejected most of them , preferring such men of letters as Mr.
Horatio Bottomley	PERSON	, the editor of
John Bull	ORGANIZATION	.

		The official report of the debates will now be more lacerating to the literary mind than ever .

		They will split their infinitives , leave their sentences unfinished and without verbs , muddle their relative clauses and perpetrate on the English language all the outrages of which only a politician in full flood is capable ; and Mr.
Asquith	PERSON	will not be there to raise the tone of the debate by his majestic and Augustan style .

		The favorite locution of the present Prime Minister is '' What you have got to remember ... '' or '' You have got to convince Labor ... '' ; and though this to me , and , I imagine , to all right-thinking littera - teurs , is perfectly odious , I doubt whether it turned a vote at the election .

		On the political aspects of the election I will not dwell because they are too painful , and because they fortunately do not fall within my province .

		I go about daily murmuring to myself a phrase which I read recently in Swin - burne 's letters and which took my fancy , a phrase about '' the God-doomed metropolis of this hell - devoted country . ''

		I find it a powerful incantation when I am reading the latest political news in my morning paper .

		I feel that I must advert oh , how easily one falls into political phraseology once one has gone near to the accursed thing !

		to the criticisms on my view of the right length for novels .

		Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	, if I may say so without offense , seems to me to be refuting something I never said and his remark about '' the old Anglo-Saxon resentment over a disciplined work of art '' is particularly unkind , since it is one of my bad habits to go about adjur - ing the English author to learn form , proportion , dis - cipline , and restraint , to look at the French and so to become a wiser man and a better artist .

		Further - more , it must have escaped Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	that I re - joiced over '' the vision of the technically perfect and harmonious novel '' which , in my judgment , the present generation has a reasonable chance of accomplishing .

		The English novel has suffered by being the province of good honest men with im - aginations who think it is easy enough to tell a tale '' in their own way '' pipe in mouth and slippered feet on a chair .

		Our novelists have nearly all been men who , being born with the temperament of the artist , think they need not give themselves the edu - cation of the artist .

		It is not thus that great art is produced , but by long and strict meditation , by pain - ful experiment , by all the agonies necessary to bring forth perfection none of which must be apparent in the finished work .

		But a mere mechanical reduction of length does not solve this problem ; and the reasons which have led to the reduction of the novel have been by no means all purely artistic .

		It is right that the novelist should ask himself , '' How much can I leave out ? ''

		But he so often answers his own question by leaving out more than his con - THE DIAL
February 22	DATE	ception can afford , that I should prefer him to word the inquiry , `` How much must I put in ? ''

		Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	will admit , I suppose , that there is no test of the Tightness of a novel 's length , except in its general harmony and the completeness and fullness of the impression which it makes on the reader 's mind .

		By this canon , the novel may range from fifty thousand words -LRB- which is shorter than any English publisher will look at without dismay -RRB- to a quarter of a million or more and that is more than our novelists at present usually dare to allow themselves .

		I do not raise merely the undiscriminat - ing slogan `` Longer Novels ! ''

		I only ask that when a writer selects a subject which can not be ade - quately treated in less than two hundred thousand words , he should not scamp it in eighty thousand , because that is the number he can conveniently write in a year and which his publisher thinks is the suitable amount to be sold for six shillings .

		There is no reason why a long novel should not have as much form and harmony , concentration and brilliance , as a short one though I admit that , other things being equal , it would naturally be more diffi - cult to impart these qualities to it .

		But I do not agree that '' brilliance '' by which in this context I understand '' work that is artistically satisfactory '' can be boring in however great a quantity ; I only wish that Miss West would give me an oppor - tunity of finding her '' brilliance '' so .

		I do main - tain , to conclude , that no limit , inferior or superior , can be set in principle upon fiction , except , in each given case , in relation to the demands of the particu - lar conception ; and I do maintain that many of our novelists do habitually ruin their conceptions by at - tempting , for reasons quite other than artistic , to treat them in an inadequate space .

		But the decision on this controversy was really given many years ago by Mr.
Hilaire Belloc	PERSON	, when someone asked him the inane question of how many words a novel should consist . ''

		It depends , '' he replied , with his ' customary lucidity and directness of thought , '' on which the words are and what their order is . ''

		EDWARD SHANKS .

		To One Who Woos Fame With Me You and I may dream of roses , Flung Like flowered kisses Through the haze And powdered air Showered At our feet Behind the candles of the world .

		But when laughter flows away And echoes die , When waving candles wane Like wearied lilies in the dusk , When shadows fade upon the painted scene , And voices Raised for soft applause Are tired grown , Murmuring As children 's voices worn at play What scent of this Will linger with the days for us ?

		What fragrant gift remain Of roses carried off , Of garlands withered overnight , Dust With the laden air That midnight left behind ?

		THORSTEIN
VEBLEN HAROLD STEARNS HELEN MAROT	PERSON	N , ATIONAL PROHIBITION MAY HAVE BEEN Dic - tated by political , social , moral , and economic con - siderations overwhelming in their combination .

		At the same time it would be folly to deny that the gain in the easier functioning of world machinery has involved some losses .

		Morally , for example , the curse of strong drink is one of the primitive enemies that have beset mankind , like the forces of nature itself , and the struggle against it has called into existence individual qualities of initiative , energy , persistence , and adroitness , which now , it is to be feared , wll be diverted from the assault against demon Rum to an alliance enabling him to make a diminished stand against extinction .

		The moral life as affected by alcohol will be so thor - oughly guarded by state control that all the lure of adventure and the chivalry of the lost cause will pass to the other side .

		No less will there be occa - sion to mark the loss to civilization through the banishment of one of the elements of culture , an element be it noted that alone saves one of the five senses for the higher uses of life .

		That which dis - tinguishes the nobler from the baser senses is doubt - less their capacity for refinement , for being educated to keenness of perception and discrimination .

		Now wine , it is fair to say , is the only medium capable of affording this training and refinement to the sense of taste .

		It is true that there is tea , which fulfills the same function for the oriental , and one recalls the story of a forest ranger whri could dis - tinguish among eleven morsels of venison the part of the animal from which each was taken ; but in the long run it is only alcohol that appeals to the taste of the occidental in sufficiently exciting form to con - stitute a motive and an end to intensive cultivation .

		And this culture has its phases , pure , ornate , gro - tesque .

		The taste of the amateur of vintage wines represents y : he classical phase ; the morbid fancy of the connoisseur of liqueurs and the inventor of pousse cafes marks the grotesque .

		It was the hero of A Rebours who invented for himself an organ of which the notes were liqueurs to be discharged in drops against his palate like musical notes against his ear drums , and from which he drew palatal symphonies , pastoral and military , humorous , pas - sionate , and pathetic .

		This may represent a degree of organization of the sense of taste unthinkable to the ordinary mind , but the reenforcement of other senses , especially hearing , afforded by that of taste is within the experience of us all .

		There is a divine congruity between
Mozart	ORGANIZATION	's symphonies and thin clear Moselle wine ;
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	takes on a lambent glow in conjunction with
Burgundy	LOCATION	; and the degus - tation of
Wagner	ORGANIZATION	is powerfully aided by
Munich	LOCATION	beer .

		The direct contribution of wine to artistic composition especially to poetry need not be dwelt upon .

		From Anacreon to
W. E. Henley	PERSON	wine has been one of the catholic sources of inspira - tion to the poetry of pleasure .

		But this is after all , an ancillary service .

		The .

		highest value of the alcoholic beverage to our civilized life is in the pos - sibility of raising a whole sense from its lowly posi - tion as a source of crude pleasure to a function of high discrimination and critical penetration in short , to a rank with the senses which furnish the basis of the fine arts and the material of culture .

		WHAT is THE BACKGROUND OF CONTEMPORARY French foreign policy , which on the surface appears nationalistic jusqu'auboutiste and even imperial - istic ?

		It is considerably easier to be harsh than to be comprehending .

		We should first try to under - stand as sympathetically as possible the basic French assumptions .

		French statesmen are not thinking of next year or the year after , but of the twenty and thirty years from now .

		And when they think of the future in the old historical concepts of the past , have they not legitimate grounds for uneasiness ?

		Consider :
France	LOCATION	's population is almost stationary ,
Germany	LOCATION	's is increasing at a rapid rate .

		The French frontier is long and comparatively unpro - tected : English and American troops can not stay there forever as a defense .

		Large sections of their land itself have been devastated ;
Germany	LOCATION	remains almost intact .

		The French debt is appalling , and without some sort of reparation they face bank - ruptcy can French statesmen be expected to for - get that they won the war ?

		The future belongs to the industrially and commercially strong , but
France	LOCATION	has been almost wrecked industrially , and she faces the attacks of a future keen and enter - prising competitor .

		These are the unpalatable facts which frighten French statesmen .

		Their motto has naturally become '' Safety first . ''

		They are trying to incorporate in the peace terms conditions which will hold
Germany	LOCATION	in check forever .

		Hence the reason for four cardinal policies , which if carried out literally will destroy any chances for a real
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	.

		First , the strengthening of the reactionary parties in
Poland	LOCATION	, in the belief that a strong , nationalistic
Poland	LOCATION	will act as a buffer against any German ambitions in the
East	LOCATION	.

		198 THE DIAL
February 22 Second	DATE	, the encouragement of extravagant
Czecho	PERSON	- slovak claims , for the same reason .

		Third , hos - tility to the incorporation of German
Austria	LOCATION	with
Germany	LOCATION	, irrespective of the wishes of the people , because the prospect of a greater
Germany	LOCATION	appalls
France	LOCATION	.

		Fourth , the annexation of the Saar valley because such an annexation will weaken
Germany	LOCATION	permanently .

		All these policies , exactly as the Russian and indemnity policies ,
spring	DATE	from this basic conviction that
France	LOCATION	must be protected .

		It is understandable , but it is folly .

		Surely the French statesmen might learn one fundamental lesson from the history which they read so assiduously the lesson that guarantees which are based on force and not on justice are in the long run worth precisely nothing .

		Worse : ultimately such guarantees pro- voke reprisals , the cost of which is greater than any benefits accruing from the original guarantees .

		The worst possible misfortune that could befall
France	LOCATION	today is that the policies now advocated by French statesmen should succeed .


France	LOCATION	is helpless and her future hopeless if today she sets the stage for a future war of '' revanche . ''

		She can not endure another war like the present .

		She can not be con - fident that she will have the same Allies , whatever may be the accord among them t6day .

		She would in all likelihood emerge from it shattered and broken .


France	LOCATION	's real protection lies in the inter - national guarantees of an effective League of Na - tions .

		For most other nations , the
League	ORGANIZATION	offers the possibility of avoiding the waste and expense of future wars .

		But for
France	LOCATION	, quite literally , the League offers her only opportunity for any con - siderable nationalistic survival .

		It is pathetic that the one great nation most in need of the
League	ORGANIZATION	should today , through whatever mistaken human motives , be most skeptical of its value .

		E : ts M ~ XPERIENCE HAS AMPLY SHOWN THAT TO treat the political prisoner like the common criminal does not deprive him of the sympathies of those who agree with him politically , but may rather endear him further to them and at any rate serve to embitter their feelings and stimulate them to unlawful reprisals . ''

		.

		So wrote
James Bryce	PERSON	some thirty years ago .

		And on the whole
Europe	LOCATION	has learned the lesson of experience .

		When the
Dublin	LOCATION	leaders in the Sinn Fein rebellion were con - fined they were treated as political prisoners , and the English government has granted amnesty to most of these Irishmen , although in many cases the charge was active rebellion and homicide .

		When
Herve	ORGANIZATION	was imprisoned in
France	LOCATION	he was placed in a separate prison for political prisoners , -LRB- as
Caillaux	PERSON	is today -RRB- ; he was allowed to write articles and continue his position as editor of a French journal .

		In
Italy	LOCATION	the status of the political prisoner is fully recognized .

		Moreover , the Italians have their own peculiar method of liberating such offenders .

		When
Cipriani	PERSON	was imprisoned in
1892	DATE	the Italian people elected him to
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	and the
Government	ORGANIZATION	was forced to free him .

		Likewise in
1894	DATE	Dr.
Nicola Barbato	PERSON	, tried for treason and serving a thirty-year sentence , was elected to
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	and released from prison in eighteen months .

		During the pres - ent war most European governments have shown a wisdom and moderation in their handling of the political prisoner which put to shame our own bar - baric and savage treatment of anyone who dis - agrees with the majority view of the moment .

		For example , no European government has sentenced a political offender for more than five years .

		Pericat called the
Bill Haywood	PERSON	of
France	LOCATION	was sentenced to five years , and he has been released since the armistice along with sixty other such offenders .


Menotti Serrati	PERSON	, editor of L'Avanti , who in
June , 1917	DATE	, led the riots of Torino which lasted seven days , was tried by a military tribunal and given only three years .

		Furthermore ,
Italy	LOCATION	has repealed the ''
Decreto Sacchi	PERSON	, '' a law imposing a two-year sentence on Socialists who urged refusal to pay taxes , and all persons imprisoned under the law have been freed and those under indictment dis - missed .

		In
England	LOCATION	, members of all parties , con - servative as well as radical , `` are demanding a gen - eral amnesty for political prisoners , and among the signers of the petition are such men as
Viscount Bryce	PERSON	,
Viscount Morley	PERSON	, and
Arthur Henderson	PERSON	.

		The contrast between European and American treatment of political prisoners is too humiliating to need emphasis .

		But there is one aspect of the matter that we are inclined to overlook .

		If public opinion in this country is so sluggish or so intimi - dated as to remain indifferent concerning the more than two thousand political prisoners now in our jails , European public opinion will not .

		Unless we soon revert to our traditional regard for freedom of conscience , European liberals may well be moved to form a protest committee , similar to the
British Protest Committee of	ORGANIZATION
1913	DATE	, who by a year of ag - gressive propaganda succeeded in securing a general amnesty for
Portugal	LOCATION	's political prisoners -LRB- among them many Syndicalists and Socialists -RRB- .

		When
John McLean	PERSON	was released from
Peterhead Prison	LOCATION	he wrote a letter to President
Wilson	PERSON	in wtiich he said : The Working Class Democracy of
Britain	LOCATION	forced the Cabinet to release me from
Peterhead Prison	LOCATION	where I was undergoing a five-year sentence under the
D. O. R. A.	PERSON	... You are in
Europe	LOCATION	to negotiate a '' Democratic Peace '' as a democrat .

		If so , I wish you to prove your sincerity by releasing
Tom Mooney	PERSON	, Billings ,
Debs	LOCATION	, Hay - wood , and all the others at present in prison as a con - sequence of their fight for Working Class Democracy .

		The
Clyde Workers	ORGANIZATION	will send me as one of their Dele - gates to the coming
Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	and there , inside and outside the conference hall , 1 shall challenge your
U. S. A.	PERSON	delegates , if my friends are not released .

		After that I shall tour
America	LOCATION	until you do justice to the real American champions of Democracy .

		Will it not be ironical justice , if we find ourselves viewed by
Europe	LOCATION	with the same pitying regard that we so lately held for the German people ?

		1919 THE DIAL 199 VJ ONFIRMATION OF THE WORST SUSPICIONS as to the political futility and military failure of the ill-starred Allied expedition to
North Russia	LOCATION	has been given in striking manner by the corre - spondent of the
Chicago Tribune	ORGANIZATION	in a cable dispatch from
Vard	ORGANIZATION	,
Norway	LOCATION	, dated
February	DATE	i ,
1919	DATE	.

		The correspondent explains why he is sending his dis - patch from
Norway	LOCATION	in vigorous and bitter terms : I have come out of
Russia	LOCATION	to write this .

		The censor - ship that has crawled back into its hole in most of the world still wears the iron heel of war days in the north .

		The American public has been fed pretty stories of the gentle glories of this '' help
Russia	LOCATION	'' expedition , but the facts are that a mess has been stewed and has been kept for the cooks themselves .

		The principal counts in the indictment , according to this , observer , are : that it has failed to inspire confidence and loyalty ; that in the minds of the soldiers the expedition has become a mere fighting job to collect
Russia	LOCATION	's debt to
Europe	LOCATION	; that the original commanders turned out to be neither diplo - mats nor soldiers ; that there is no enthusiasm even among the intelligent Russians in the north to assist the Allies and fight the Bolsheviki ; '' that the beautiful faith of the Russians in
America	LOCATION	is break - ing under the manhandling by our forces under the foreign command . ''

		As an example of '' man - handling '' by our - troops the correspondent cites the instance of a purely political strike of protest by the workingmen of Archangel , where our men always under foreign command were used for the manning of the street cars , in a word , as strike - breakers .

		It is not a pretty report which the
Tribune	ORGANIZATION	's correspondent gives , but there is no reason to doubt its authenticity .

		He supplies a wealth of detail about the war-weariness of the Allied soldiers and about the utter destruction of their faith in the good intentions of the expedition .

		The men were led to believe that they were to be used solely to police the city ; they actually found that they were sent hundreds of miles inland on foolish and wasteful '' offensives , '' which resulted only in retreats and loss of men .

		They were led to believe that they were to protect supplies from the Germans ; they found no supplies and no Ger - mans to protect them from .

		They were led to be - lieve that they would be welcomed by the '' loyal '' Russians ; they found that they were met with dis - trust and that most of the natives frankly preferred the tyranny of
Moscow	LOCATION	to the tyranny of foreign bayonets .

		In fact , the entire dispatch gives ir - refutable proof of the truth for which THE DIAL has long been contending that the whole Archangel adventure is a disgraceful and imperialistic bit of brigandage in which the employment of American troops is humiliating and shameful .

		There is evi - dence that the
Paris	LOCATION	Conference has decided defi - nitely to - withdraw Aljied troops from
Russia	LOCATION	, recognizing the military futility of the whole ex - pedition .

		And the quicker we get out of
Russia	LOCATION	the better the Russians will like it .

		JL HE COUNTRY HAS BEEN WAITING FOR MONTHS for the opinion of
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	on the con - stitutionality of the Espionage Act .

		The reason why the opinion is delayed is that each time a case is about to reach the court on appeal the Depart - ment of
Justice	ORGANIZATION	confesses error , or requests postpone - ment .

		This has happened often enough to raise the question whether the
Department	ORGANIZATION	is itself con - fident of the constitutionality of the Act under which it has imprisoned hundreds of men and women .

		There is no question of the terrific blow to the prestige of the government in general and of this administration in particular which the dis - covery of the unconstitutioriality of the Act would deal .

		The Act was passed under the lash and spur of the President .

		His
Department of Justice	ORGANIZATION	has enforced it with ruthlessness .

		The discovery that men and women now undergoing confinement in loathsome prisons for terms of ten to thirty years have been deprived of their freedom without due and proper process of law will fill up the measure of indignation and contempt which will be meted out to those responsible for a shameful miscarriage of justice .

		This possibility is another reason for insisting on the repeal of the Act and the immedi - ate pardon of those suffering under it .

		Senator
France	LOCATION	of
Maryland	LOCATION	, one of the few brave Senators who voted against the Act on its original introduc - tion , has introduced a bill for its repeal .

		It will be passed if the public demands it .

		AT WILL BE AGREED THAT PRESIDENT
WILSON	PERSON	'S choice of representatives to meet the
Bolsheviki	PERSON	was a happy one .

		In Professor
Herron	PERSON	, Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	found a delegate who speaks , or at least under - stands , the economic language of the men whom he is sent to meet .

		The other delegate , Mr.
William A. White	PERSON	, of
Kansas	LOCATION	, can be trusted as can few Americans , not to make a fool of himself or his country .

		His reported interview on his appoint - ment contains sound sense on the Russian situation .

		It reminds one of the words of
Gamaliel	PERSON	when the Jews were in doubt what to do with the
Bolsheviki of Jerusalem	ORGANIZATION	.

		Said
Gamaliel	PERSON	: `` Ye men of
Israel	LOCATION	, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men ... Refrain from these men and let them alone .

		For if this counsel or this work be of men it will come to naught : but if it be of God , ye can not overthrow it ; lest haply ye be found to fight against God . ''

		The Jews took his advice , and -LRB- like `` an American mob -RRB- when they had beaten up the apostles , they let them go .

		T AH HE DlAL APOLOGIZES TO
MR. GERALD DU MAURIER	PERSON	for the inadvertence of a contributor who , in its issue of
January 25	DATE	, made him responsible for the play An Englishman 's Home .

		The author of course was Major Guy du Maurier , the actor - manager 's brother , who was killed in
1914	DATE	.

		200 THE DIAL
February 22	DATE	Foreign Comment LONG LIVE THE GERMAN REPUBLIC !

		The following manifesto appeared originally in the
Paris	LOCATION	paper Humanite , and was reprinted in the
Berliner Tageblatt	ORGANIZATION	, from which -LRB- as copied in the
New York	LOCATION	Staats Zeitung -RRB- we translate , as copies of Humanite are not easy to acquire in this country : In the name of the organized French working class , the united workers greet the German Republic .

		This histori - cal crisis must signify the end of the lordship of power and the beginning of responsibility on the part of the people .

		The revolution of the German people conditions the attitude of the working classes of the Allied lands , who now more than ever before must desire from their own governments that peace be created upon the founda - tions of freedom and on the self-determination of peoples .

		Militarism is finally defeated .

		The world must be again rebuilt on new international principles , and the rebuild - ing must follow on the basis of equality for all people .

		The working classes of the lands of the
Entente	ORGANIZATION	face a great duty .

		They must destroy every chauvinistic move - ment and not permit the military power of the
Entente	ORGANIZATION	, under the pretense of restoring law and order , to attack the new regimes in
Russia	LOCATION	,
Austria Hungary	LOCATION	, and Ger - many .

		We have certainty that the international power of the workers which ultimately will be recreated will conquer .

		We must especially guard what freedom we have won .

		Our first demand is full amnesty for all .

		The end of the military imperialistic adventures must give us full spiritual and industrial freedom , without which a social democracy can not exist .

		Humanite of another date appeared with a great flaring headline : `` Citizens lay down your arms , the German Republic lives ! ''

		THE LAST PARADOX SIR : The following passage from a letter recently received from
Paris	LOCATION	will , I think , interest your readers as it has me .

		The writer , a Frenchman of high civil position , volunteered at the outbreak of the war and served four years in the trenches , being wounded and also suffering from fever .

		He is one of the many men '' muris par 1 ` epreuve terrible de la guerre elle-meme , '' who has won the right .

		to be heard on peace : Voyez-vous , mon ami , 1 ` un des paradoxes de cette guerre , le derniere peut-etre et le plus gros de conse - quences : C'est qu'au moment d'etablir le statut du monde issu de cette guerre , aucune des democraties victorieuses n'appellera et ne songe meme d'appeller un de ces hommes muris par 1 ` epreuve terrible de la guerre elle - meme un de ceux qui dans la solitude morale des tran - chees , etait soutenu par le reve magnifique d'un avenir meilleur et pensait qu'un tel reve justifait tous les sacri - fices .

		Combien sont morts avec cette esperance !

		Les autres , les survivants n'ont actuellement aucun moyen de se faire entendre des puissance en exercise .

		Livres aux seuls professionels de la diplomatic et de la politique pour lesquels le passe qu'ils nous ont fait ne saurait servir de recommendation , vous comprenez que je ne sais guere rassure ... Neither the voice of the dead who died sustained by '' the magnificent dream of a better future , '' nor the voice of their living comrades who '' in the moral solitude of the trenches thought that such a dream justified all the sacrifices '' will be heard in the conference hall of the Quai d'Orsay .

		No !


Milner	PERSON	,
Bonar Law	ORGANIZATION	,
Balfour	LOCATION	, Sonino , et al those '' professionals of diplomacy and of politics for whom the past that they have made for us hardly serves for a recommendation , '' have locked them - selves away in the customary secrecy of the profes - sion from the eyes of the world to organize that new world , which others died and suffered to give birth to .

		ROBERT
HERRICK	PERSON	.


University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	.

		Communications THE TEST OF DEMOCRACY SIR : Those who have watched President Wil - son 's varied career with regard to the woman suf - frage question will read with indignation but no surprise his reply to the delegation of French work - ing women who made the reasonable and timely re - quest that woman suffrage be included among the points to be settled by the
Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	.

		If the war was fought for democracy -LRB- as he said it was -RRB- and if Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	really cared about jus - tice to women , he would have answered to the effect that a minimum standard of democracy should be required of the countries which are to enter the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	, and that no nation would be considered eligible until it has fully enfranchised its women .

		But such explicitness and direct deal - ing is not in Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's line and he merely re - plied that a Conference of Peace settling the rela - tions of nations with each other would be '' regarded as going very much outside its province if it under - took to dictate to the several states what their in - ternal policy should be '' ; and then bethinking him - self that this stand was not consistent with the recognition to be accorded to Labor by the Con - ference , expressed a vague hope that some occasion might be offered for the suffragists to present their case .

		He then proceeded to smooth things over by paying the women of
France	LOCATION	some elaborate compli - ments , using the sentimental platitudes and Spen - cerian copybook maxims in which his vocabulary is so rich : his '' heart , '' his '' feelings , '' '' nerves of sympathy , '' his '' passion for democracy '' stock phrases the value of which foreign nations will soon learn to estimate as they are estimated in this country .

		As if graceful flattery from him or anyone could recompense women for the agony they have endured in this terrible war , or act as a substitute for the justice they are demanding .

		Politicians have long been accustomed to reward those who , - have suffered and sacrificed in two ways the men with honors , titles , fortunes , pensions , high offices , and other substantial considerations ; women with - praise , flattery , expressions of apprecia - tion , words , words , words !

		.

		As Hamlet pointed out this is to be '' promise-fed , '' '' air-crammed '' and even poultry could not be fed after this fashion .

		1919 THE DIAL 2OI As for the President 's further statement that suf - frage is a '' domestic question for the several na - tions , '' one would think he might be somewhat chary of that topic inasmuch as it was the Democratic Party which killed the Federal Suffrage Amendment in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	a slaughter to which Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	largely contributed through his election attacks upon pro-suffrage Senators and his hearty support of the Anti-Senators .

		To cite one instance among many , last
spring	DATE	at the primaries -LRB- the only place where a candidate can be defeated in the solidly Demo - cratic South -RRB- Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	successfully bent all his efforts to defeat the senior Senator from
Mississippi	LOCATION	on the ground that the latter did not support the
Administration	ORGANIZATION	policies though Mr.
Vardaman	PERSON	was in favor of the Federal Amendment and voted for it in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	.

		Another flagrant case of bad faith with the confiding suffragists who looked to the President to put their bill through was his refusal to appeal to the people 1 of
Tennessee	LOCATION	to vote against Senator
Shields	PERSON	of that state after the latter had contemptuously disregarded Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's request that he should support the Federal Amendment .

		Mr.
Shields	PERSON	' opponent was an upholder of all the President 's policies , including woman suffrage , but this brought him no help from the
White House	ORGANIZATION	.

		When the
November	DATE	elections drew near Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	threw suffrage to the wolves and came out in hotly-partisan support of antis and against suf - fragists .

		We are forced to conclude that if the Federal Amendment be one of Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's poli - cies , it is only between elections , like the man who was a '' vegetarian between meals '' .

		Is it any won - der that when the vote in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	was taken immediately after the Prsident 's magnificent speech , the suffrage majority was still two votes short ?

		The party members must have listened to Mr.
Wil	PERSON	- son 's eloquence with their tongues in their cheeks , evidently confident that they could oppose the Presi - dent 's wishes with impunity and that for ' once the party whip would not be cracked over their heads by the party leader , as it had been on so many occa - sions when they had tried to defy the President on a subject which he really had at heart .

		So women are standing in front of the
White House	ORGANIZATION	burning the eloquent phrases that come to us from across the seas where Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	is still talking about freedom , liberty , justice , and democ - racy .

		The prisons in
Washington	LOCATION	are crowded with suffragists from every state in the
Union	LOCATION	, who have broken no law , whose only offense is that they have asked for deeds not words .

		On
February 15	DATE	the Prison Special went out from
Washington	LOCATION	bearing to the far South and West the just demand that the Democratic slackers in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	be .

		required to furnish forthwith the one vote necessary to pass the bill through the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	before this
Congress	ORGANIZATION	adjourns on Mar < h 4 , and thus tardily give justice and liberty to American women .

		SOVIET
RUSSIA	LOCATION	AND THE AMERICAN CONSTITUTION SIR : I wish to make a correction in the illumi - nating article by
Lincoln Colcord	ORGANIZATION	-LSB- in THE DIAL for
December 28 , 1918	DATE	-RSB- entitled Soviet
Russia	LOCATION	and the American Revolution , in line with the author 's ad - mission at the outset that `` the drawing of historical analogies is a perilous undertaking . ''

		In his com - parison he confuses the American Revolutionary leaders with the framers of the
American Constitu	ORGANIZATION	- tion .

		He then says that the framers `` certainly strove to construct an instrument by virtue of which the actual majority of the electorate should control the government .

		They certainly strove to render impossible the domination of a ruling class , to do away with the artificial complexities of politics , and to bring every function of government within the grasp and comprehension of the whole electorate . ''

		Now this would do very well for the Revolutionary leaders , but the Convention of
1787	DATE	was a counter - revolutionary movement born out of the fear of the recent `` excess of democracy . ''

		The framers of the Constitution asserted as their supreme aim the pro- tection of property rights ; the doctrine that `` prop - erty is the main object of government '' was repeat - edly declared and never seriously disputed .

		As
Woodrow Wilson	PERSON	says : `` The federal government was not by intention a democratic government .

		In plan and structure it had been meant to check the sweep and power of popular majorities ... The government had , in fact , been originated and organ - ized upon the initiative and primarily in the interest of the mercantile and wealthy classes .

		Originally conceived in an effort to accommodate commercial disputes between the states , it had been urged to adoption by a minority , under the concerted and aggressive leadership of able men representing a rul - ing class . ''

		WHEN DREAMS COME TRUE SIR : Much of the criticism that is being meted out against the Presidential program of peace is based upon the unwarranted assumption that man is essentially a practical being .

		We hear stated again and again , '' The
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	is a fine idealistic scheme , but it is not practical . ''

		It is not very evident why the lack of practicality should cause concern to man , the fabric of whose life is built , not on practicality , but on dreams .

		To live at all as human beings is to be impractical .

		Our whole civilization we owe to the impracticality of man ; where his work has endured , it has looked far beyond his practical needs and the demands of the moment .

		The epicure , eating , drinking , and making merry , is your practical being .

		The wild beast is essentially practical ; he contents himself with his full meal today , taking no thought for the mvstical morrow .

		But man builds for the morrow ; 202 THE DIAL
February 22	DATE	his sowing and reaping , his planning and building , point toward the future , the unknown , the non - existent .

		Having only today , holding only one moment at a time in his hand , his bold faith plans for the years and the centuries .

		The typical American prides himself upon be - ing a practical man ; he does not recognize that in one sense to continue to live at all is to stand con - victed of being impractical .

		He grumbles about high prices and low wages , about poor crops and devastating weather , when he himself if he were really practical and sincere in his querulousness '' might his quietus make with a bare bodkin . ''

		It is the vision of the unknown , of the unseen , which alike holds man back and drives him forward .

		With prices high , and war and pestilence raging , it would seem the height of folly to fall in love , and the summit of impracticality to marry .

		When it is difficult for one person to live , plain arithmetic , the most practical of sciences , proclaims that it is at least twice as difficult for two people to live , yet the majority of mankind commit just that folly , and insure that human living shall continue along the line of impracticality .

		It looks as if men will achieve a League of Na - tions , not because it satisfies those who call them - selves practical , but because such a league is con - sistent with man 's real needs and the spirit of hu - man living .

		After all , man lives , and moves and has his being , when he is most human , in faith , in the world of imagination ; and men achieve dreams because , in truth , they themselves are '' such stuff as dreams are made of . ''


M. T. SEYMOUR	PERSON	.


Urbana	LOCATION	,
Illinois	LOCATION	.

		MR.
UNTERMEYER	PERSON	RAISES His SHIELD SIR : I was both pained surprised at the contents as well as the tone of
Arturo Giovannitti	ORGANIZATION	's expostu - latory letter in THE DIAL of
February 8	DATE	concern - ing my review of
Max Eastman 's Colors of Life	ORGANIZATION	.

		An attack from any other quarter would have troubled me less .

		Giovannitti compels - my deep admiration ; to
Max Eastman	PERSON	I bear the compli - cated relation of admirer , fellow worker , and friend .

		This fondness embraces most of his activities .

		I have an abiding respect for Eastman the person , the propagandist , the pamphleteer , the provocative para - grapher not , unfortunately , for Eastman the poet .

		Personally , I wish I were a blind worshipper of the well-written if often flavorless verse that Eastman indites between his pungent and penetrating edi - torials .

		But much as I am stirred by his clean-cut and lively prose , I am -LRB- and it is possibly one of my many limitations -RRB- unmoved by most of his metrical lines which , unlike his ametrical ones , seem the result of a desire to write rather than a burning need to create .

		So , when I took up Colors of Life , it seemed natural to me that the prose preface contained much more Eastman than the proper and undistinguished blank verse of The Thought of Protagoras , the pseudo-Elizabethan fancy of A
Praiseful Complaint	ORGANIZATION	, and the mere pleasantness of such lyrics as Autumn Light ,
Hours	ORGANIZATION	, and others .

		What struck me as the most valuable portions of the little volume were the unrhymed parts in which
Eastman	ORGANIZATION	's natural gifts as philosophic essayist were displayed at their best .

		And when .

		one considers that this book of little more than one hundred pages contains over thirty pages of prose , my emphasis was not quite so inconsistent nor so '' unconventional '' as Mr.
Giovannitti	PERSON	suggests .

		Criticism is not always the impersonal and
Olymp	PERSON	- ian affair that it is supposed to be .

		My own articles bear their personal bias obviously ; they may even err on the side of an emotional conviction .

		Still , I think it rather unlikely that a review of a book written by a man I am anxious to praise would degenerate into a parade of prejudices particularly non-existent ones .

		BANISHMENT OR DEATH SIR : Is not the time ripe for the establishment ` of a penal farm for our intellectuals ?

		Somewhere in
Montana	LOCATION	, perhaps ; however , upon reflection ,
Alaska	LOCATION	, for reasons of climate and isolation , seems to be far the better place .

		In the good old days in
Russia	LOCATION	there was a
Siberia	LOCATION	that served the purpose for
Russia	LOCATION	.

		If the intellectual escaped
Siberia	LOCATION	, he had to fly the country altogether .

		Now , of course , all the intellectuals have flocked back again , and they are causing no end of trouble .

		Is
America	LOCATION	going to be so short-sighted as to dilly-dally with her intellectuals ?

		Quick action is necessary .

		We must not only prevent an exodus of these agitators to
Russia	LOCATION	; we must put them all in a place in this country where we can keep an eye on them .

		Did not
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	, in his preface to Major
Barbara	PERSON	, give us solemn warning as many as four - teen years ago ?

		Did he not throw up his hands and admit by asserting the contrary , that all his ideas , like the ideas of his fellows , came from beetle - browed Scandinavians and other continental -RCB- unde - sirables ?

		Was it not clear to us all , when
Ibsen	PERSON	was introduced to us a generation ago , that
America	LOCATION	's future welfare lay in the cultivation of things to which the cultivation of ideas was quite opposed ?

		Did we not all rise up as one man in opposition to ideas ?

		The time was ripe then to squelch the in - tellectuals forever .

		Now is our last chance .

		The whole country is clamoring for action .

		And the bagging of the game will be mere child 's play ; for these intellectuals many of them are becoming regular dare-devils , speaking and writing in the open , and those who do not speak and write can be easily identified by their moody and melancholy appearance .

		1919 THE DIAL 203 Notes on New Books BIRTH .

		By
Zona Gale	PERSON	.

		Macmillan ;
$ 1.60	MONEY	.

		It is no slight accomplishment to catch the flavor of folk , to render the reality which lies beneath the flat surface of American village existence , but that is what
Zona Gale	PERSON	has achieved hei ^ e. Sometimes by a flash of insight , sometimes by a mere turn of phrase , she illuminates the dullest of incidents so that they take on dignity and significance .

		It is this quality the art , with none of the tedium of taking pains which lends most value to this story .

		- The little town of Burage , which lies not so far from
Chicago	LOCATION	, is realized in all its tiresome detail , all its emphatic trivialities , and yet the reader 's sympathy is held and his interest fed by the keenness of obser - vation .

		One gets a fresh insight into the uneventful routine of lives whose daily high-water mark of animation is a going downtown to the postoffice '' dusty , fly-specked little hole , where the state func - tioned as precisely as under hardwood and marble ; and , in their tiny glass coffins , marked with worn red letters , were popped missives of death , of life , of love , of unspeakable commonplace . ''

		It is against this background that the gentle life tragedy of a wistful , indecisive little idealist , Mar - shall
Pitt	PERSON	, is drawn a figure which has no flourish , no positive attractiveness , and is yet presented with a penetrating sympathy .

		Zona
Gale	PERSON	plays a bit off key when she sends him to
Alaska	LOCATION	, for there is not enough adventure in his soul to carry him that far from Burage , but for the most part she draws a consistent , living character .


Marshall Pitt	PERSON	's son is not so successfully rendered ; he is too palpably shaped to the needs of the novel and its title .

		But it is the father who is the real pivot of interest , and the author has invested him richly with the frail garments of humanity .

		THE POETRY OF GEORGE EDWARD WOOD - BERRY : A Critical Study .

		By
Louis V. Ledoux	PERSON	.

		Dodd ,
Mead	LOCATION	;
$ 1	MONEY	.

		In this small volume Mr.
Ledoux	PERSON	gives a sym - pathetic critical study of a poet who should be much better known .

		Professor
Woodberry	PERSON	is no doubt among the number who are admired greatly if at all , but the critic has been careful not to express his admiration in superlatives .

		He aims rather to analyze the poems than to estimate the poet 's place in American letters .

		Intense spirituality , a pas - sionate loyalty to the ideal with an almost equal devotion to the world of sense , a growing breadth of interest and sympathy , the love of children , an unusually keen appreciation of color and light , and a growing perception of the complete interrelation of all manifestations of the `` life-spirit '' are the char - acteristics which have most deeply impressed the critic .

		`` It is , '' he states , `` the passion in Mr.

		TIN COWRIE DASS .

		By
Henry Milncr Rideout	PERSON	.

		Duffield ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		In Mr.
Rideout	PERSON	's latest ' story is none of the usual claptrap of the lost heir of the kingdom tale .

		Tin
Cowrie Dass	ORGANIZATION	, in his white clothes , pulling the greasy thong to move the linen fan above the manager in a small Hindu bank , is an engaging and real character ; his adventures follow with romantic inevitability .

		Mr.
Rideout	PERSON	manages his narrative with skilful suggestion of background , people , and incident , until the comic-opera ending possesses illusion enough to be entertaining .

		Tin
Cowrie Dass	ORGANIZATION	, consistent , calmly heroic , offers him - self to the reader for a satisfactory hour of ad - venturing .

		The story is slight , but the dexterity with which Mr.
Rideout	PERSON	presents it compensates for its lack of elaborate plot .

		JUNGLE PEACE .

		By
William Beebe	PERSON	.

		Holt :
$ 1-75	MONEY	.

		It is the true scientist who can run the risk of being imaginative Mr.
Beebe	PERSON	's charming book is admirable proof of that .

		The timid naturalist or the too frequent dessicated product of the labora - tory will protect himself from criticism by the main - tenance of a carefully restrained '' objectivity '' ; he will hesitate to be dramatic or narrative for fear of being called anthropomorphic ; he will be scrupu - lous in his observation and records of fact and infernally dull .

		He will be meticulous in > his cata - loguing of the colors of a bird , but he will shun expressing any spontaneous affection for it if it is a beauty , like the scarlet tanager , or any spon - taneous dislike for it if it is repellent , like the bald - headed vulture .

		He will set down in great detail .

		the profusion of plant life in the tropical jungle , but he will shrink from illuminating similes .

		Least of all will this type of scientist be caught in a sentimental mood ; he may , out of the weakness of his heart , rescue a besieged frog from the implac - able attacks of army ants , exactly as Mr.
Beebe	PERSON	did , but he will not be likely to tell of it .

		In a word , he will be afraid to be '' popular . ''

		He will shrink from the tacit criticisms of his colleagues , who too often tend to regard any injection of sap and dramatic vividness into a scientific account as somehow a debasing of science 's high estate .

		The truth is , this attitude is largely superstition .

		It 204 THE DIAL
February 22	DATE	springs really from a scientific diffidence and not from scientific exactitude .

		Aside from the purely technical treatise or discussion , which is of course another matter , the best criterion of the effective and able scientist is whether or not he can let himself go , naturally and easily ; whether he is so saturated in his subject that he can be almost naive before it .

		Mr.
Beebe	PERSON	is a scientist whose repute is beyond question , yet he has written a volume more genuinely dramatic and thrilling and pictur - esque than any adventure tale by a popular novelist .

		Nor to do it does he have recourse to phantasy which is so happily employed by that exquisite ornithologist ,
W. H. Hudson	PERSON	.

		He devotes a whole chapter to A
Yard of Jungle	ORGANIZATION	, which is exactly what it says it is , a square yard of jungle earth and roots , a few feet thick , teeming with animal and plant life of all kinds , for the mold contained over a thousand different animal organisms visible to the eye , as well as numberless roots and sprouting shoots .

		And the whole drama of evolution is exhibited in microcosm in that square yard of earth and loam , the whole pathos and humor and irony of the strug - gle for existence and of nature 's inextinguishable vitality .

		Still more remarkable and illuminating is the chapter on the hoatzins , those extraordinary birds that still preserve the reptilian habits of ages past .

		Mr.
Beebe	PERSON	actually makes one see what life must have resembled millions of years ago , when the future course of their evolution was still .

		un - certain for thousands of zoologically unde - cided creatures .

		There is plenty in the book to satisfy scientific curiosity .

		But Mr.
Beebe	PERSON	's distinc - tive achievement does not consist of this .

		It con - sists of his power to summon and vivify the-tu - multous ` life of the jungle and the sea and the tropic earth .

		Everywhere his observation turns , the pano - rama of animal or vegetable existence is unfolded , and its inner rhythm and color are disclosed .

		He catches and transfers to his pages the sting and glow of the never-ending naturalistic drama .

		And he does it with a literary precision and sensitive - ness beside which the conventional stylistic virtues of descriptive writing become tepid and cheap .

		OUR NATIONAL FORESTS .

		By
Richard H. D. Boerker	PERSON	.

		Macmillan ;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		The necessity for the preservation of our natural resources has been brought home to the American people in recent years in no uncertain tones by the increased cost of lumber , minerals , and other com - modities because of prodigal waste in the past .

		An encouraging phase of this preservation movement is found in the development of our national forests , which at present cover over 155,000,000 acres .

		Dr.
Boerker	PERSON	in this interesting book brings together the many facts connected with forestry as a national problem , with the creation and organization of the national forests , the administration and protection of the national forests , and the sale and rental of forest resources .

		A number of half-tone cuts , from original photographs , make the author 's points more vivid .

		The protection of the forests against fires has come to be recognized as a joint problem and duty to be borne by the individual state and the nation .

		A further step in conservation should be taken by forbidding any timber owner to cut his timber with - out the consent of the government , and the gov - ernment should see to it that he leaves the young growth as a basis for the future crop , or provides a new growth of timber by planting young trees .

		The book is a popular and , at the same time , scienti - fic presentation of a great national problem .

		KIPLING THE STORY-WRITER .

		By
Walter Morris Hart	PERSON	.


University of California Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 2.25	MONEY	.

		This is the most comprehensive study of
Rudyard Kipling	ORGANIZATION	's prose technique which has yet appeared ; it can , in fact , probably be regarded as definitive complete and scholarly without being stodgy .

		Pro- fessor
Hart	PERSON	might have modified one or two of his conclusions and amplified several others , had he extended his survey to the stories collected in A Di - versity of Creatures , but the permanent groundwork will remain and will not be neglected by anyone interested in the art of the short story .

		Professor
Hart	PERSON	divides
Kipling	ORGANIZATION	's prose into three periods Indian , transitional , and English and among the many merits of his book , perhaps the most conspicuous is its recognition of the superior quality of the works of
Kipling	ORGANIZATION	's later , or English , period .

		After reading the lucubrations of critics whose acquaintance with Kipling apparently ceased with the publication of The Day 's Work -LRB- can it be that they derive their knowledge from the premium sets given away with the works of
O. Henry	ORGANIZATION	? -RRB-

		, it is refreshing to encounter a man who appreciates the perfection of such a little ' masterpiece as Marklake Witches ; who realizes that An Habitation Enforced is '' one of the most utterly satisfactory stories that Kipling has written '' ; and who avows his belief that They is not only its author 's best story , but '' even one of the best in the English language . ''

		In the technique of The Brushwood Boy , on the other hand , Professor
Hart	PERSON	finds many flaws ; though at the end , after comparing it with the two or three other tales on analogous themes in our own or other literatures , he is constrained to admit that '' as a story of pure romantic love , -LSB- it -RSB- more than holds its own . ''

		A few errors of fact and of interpretation may be noted .

		The Lost Legion was not '' destroyed by the natives who remained true to the English , '' but by Afghans beyond the Border who slew for the sake of plunder .

		Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	does not '' con - tinue to live at Rottingdean '' ; for the past fifteen years , or thereabouts , he has lived at
Burwash	LOCATION	, in the
Weald	LOCATION	.

		Finally , Professor
Hart	PERSON	, in common with every other critic who has noticed the story , errs in seeming to ascribe the comparative shadowi - ness of the figures of Ortheris and
Mulvaney	PERSON	in
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 205 Garm to the late date of its composition ; the tale in fact antedates Kim , first having been published in
1899	DATE	, though not collected until ten years later .

		In general , however , the book is remarkable for its accuracy .

		BACKGROUNDS FOR SOCIAL WORKERS .

		By
Edward J. Menge	PERSON	.

		Badger ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Infinite are the number of books written on sociology every year .

		As a textbook , Professor
Menge	PERSON	's
Backgrounds for Social Workers	ORGANIZATION	deserves to find its place with the others on our college library shelves .

		Aside from the discussion of the threadbare yet vital subjects of Marriage and The Family , the writer devotes several chapters to such modern questions as
Birth Control	ORGANIZATION	, Eugenics , Sterilization , and Sex-Instruction and Training .

		After all , it is simply a matter of point of view .

		Professor
Menge	PERSON	is neither an advocate of birih control nor sterilization of the feeble-minded and insane .

		He thinks that the problem can be entirely solved by education first , of the parents ; then , of their children .

		On the same bookshelf next to Professor
Menge	PERSON	's book we might find a physician 's discussion of the same subject from the scientific rather than from the moral point of view .

		One says , train your child to '' want '' to do the right thing , give him the proper early instruction and the future will work itself out ; the other says , remember the curse of bad inheritance , teach your public the simplest scientific principles and there will be less misery about us .

		We can not understand the present without a knowledge of the past .

		The psychological basis of the family today evolved out of the primitive family of the past .

		Therefore Professor
Menge	PERSON	's discus - sion of the family , though dealing in familiar things , is not out of place .

		He takes us in detail through the less known phases the Medieval , the
Renais	PERSON	- sance , and the Reformation family in a more in - teresting way , perhaps , than the average textbook .

		COLONIAL MERCHANTS AND THE AMERICANS REVOLUTION .

		By
Arthur Meier Schlesinger	PERSON	.


Columbia University Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 4	MONEY	.

		There are some things about the American Revo - lution that have long needed to be cleared up .

		One of these is the part and conduct of the American commercial interests in the movement .

		Another is the contribution of the religious groups of the colonies .

		And still a third is the frontiersmen .

		The last is perhaps the best understood , thanks to Pro- fessor
Turner	ORGANIZATION	's studies .

		And now Professor
Schles	PERSON	- inger endeavors to clear up the first .

		He has succeeded in very large degree and where he has not quite satisfied us , he has yet suggested the way to a better understanding .

		The commercial interests of
1770	DATE	, let us say , were divided into several groups that did not always recognize common aims .

		The shipping and importing men of
New England	LOCATION	were the aristocrats of their section and time .

		They wished the world to remain very much as it was .

		But the English monopolists , notably the
East India Company	ORGANIZATION	, would not take them in '' on the ground floor , '' as we say .

		Their agitations in the early part of the Revolutionary struggle were , then , almost exclusively for a betterment of the world from their point of view and not for independence or , least of all , democracy .

		When they found , as Mr.
Schlesinger	PERSON	shows very clearly , that indepen - dence and democracy were the aims of
Adams	PERSON	and his '' agitators , '' they promptly withdrew from the campaign .

		The Southern merchants and credit brokers , mostly Scotch dependents of the
London	LOCATION	tobacco traders , made a class to themselves .

		They were never free enough to join any radical move - ment , although the planters , groaning under the burden of usurious debts , like the Western farmers of
1896	DATE	, compelled from them in the early part of the struggle some sort of assistance .

		It was hardly different with the
Middle Colony	ORGANIZATION	merchants .

		All of these lent some sort of aid to American agitations fn the earlier years of the quarrel .

		Most of them returned to their conservative moorings when democracy seemed to loom .

		Mr.
Schlesinger	PERSON	has analyzed these groups very well .

		He has shown just what they did and what they wished , although he has not given names and amounts of fortunes or businesses involved .

		Per - haps this feature is beyond accurate and definite portrayal .

		Some help may be got from
Sabine	LOCATION	on the personal side ; something on the economic side from
Davis	PERSON	' Corporations , published a year or two ago .

		One element of the problem has escaped the present author , as it has escaped all his predecessors .

		That is the effect of the liquor interests of
Boston	LOCATION	and other
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	towns .

		It might seem like exaggera - tion to suggest that the rum trade was a great factor in the
American Revolution	ORGANIZATION	.

		As the story has never been fairly set forth , it might have been brought within the scope of the present work .

		The positive contributions of the present author are important and numerous .

		The ebb and flow of the tide of revolution , the hopes and fears of democratic leaders , and the final break of the farmers , the mechanics , and the frontiersmen from the timid merchants are all made clearer than they have hith - erto been .

		And at the conclusion it is once more shown that the merchants and the professional men , the shipowners and the embryo financiers , who were unwillingly dragged along the path of revolt and freedom , united at the end of the war to bring about a federal organization , both social and national in tendency , that would conserve their interests and defeat , as far as might be possible , the aims of the radicals .

		Wars seldom attain their ends .

		It was so in
1783	DATE	.

		The merchants set out to get a fairer share of the profits of British trade .

		They soon found themselves in the midst of a wide-reaching demo - cratic upheaval .

		This they tried to control .

		They failed and the real war men went their vyay to independence .

		But independence cost so much , and A \ 2C > 6 THE DIAL so many blunders were committed , that the traders got back into the movement and set up a social machine in
1789	DATE	that much resembled the British empire which had been so sadly disrupted .

		ANTHROPOLOGY UP-TO-DATE .

		By
George Winter Mitchell	PERSON	.


Stratford	LOCATION	; 75 cts .

		This skit runs the risk of not being so popular as it deserves .

		In the guise of a solid little treatise , with chapter headings like Method ,
Magic	ORGANIZATION	, The Social Unit , The Origin of Exogamy , and with foot - note references to
Tylor	LOCATION	,
Frazer	PERSON	,
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	,
Robertson Smith	PERSON	, and other eminent authorities , the author expounds one current anthropological doctrine after another , to slide off by gradual reductions into the absurd , or again to break outright into burlesque .

		Or , when the reader is unwary , he will carry him through from thin to thinner theory with straight - faced irony .

		Half the cants of anthropology are tenderly undraped , all its most hollow pomposities neatly pierced and collapsed .

		Even he who has but little interest in the verities as opposed to the pre - tensions of science , can not but see what game is on foot and smile at its deftness .

		Mr.
Mitchell	PERSON	, who resides at
Queen 's University	ORGANIZATION	,
Kingston	LOCATION	, is a more than unprofessorial professor .

		But then he is a professor of the classics , on which the attempt has recently been made to foist some of the crassest products and extensions of ethnology .

		The little volume will thoroughly amuse any in - telligent reader for an hour .

		But it carries a moral for the serious minded .

		If anthropology can be so easily shown up and legitimately ridiculed , what merit can it still claim ?

		The fact is , there are two streams in the science .

		One is learned but naive , comparative but unorganized , finding evolutions and ready explanations at will , and piling hypothesis on hypothesis as if building high enough on a theory would convert it into fact .

		This is the anthropology that produces the books on the shelves of well - appointed libraries , and that filters into magazines ,
Sunday	DATE	supplements , and parlor conversations .

		The Socialists have made some of it into a party plank ; th6 colleges spread it before thousands of students often when the teachers are anthropologists , near - ly always when they hail either from biology or from sociology .

		The other current knows that knowledge is dif - ficult and laborious , and devoid of short cuts .

		It does not hope to solve all problems of human evolu - tion by a series of happy guesses over night , but to work out this story piece by piece , with every re -- course of tethnical skill .

		Its pronouncements are therefore fragmentary and tentative , like all the dicta of true science .

		This kind of anthropology offers no intellectual panaceas and no stimulus but for the hard thinker .

		The public naturally has little inter - est in it .

		The result is that books like
Boas	PERSON	' Mind of Primitive Man and
Wissler	PERSON	's The American In - dian , to mention only two recent American examples , have not a tenth the general reputation or influence of the seductively vague and pedantically unsound works of the authors referred to above .

		It is by driving a wedge between these two sorts of anthropology , and exposing the sham * kind , that
Mitchell	PERSON	's wit is justified and useful .

		GOD 'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE WAR .

		By
Edward S. Drown	PERSON	.

		Macmillan ; 60 cts .

		The primary object vof this compact modern theodicy is to excuse God from any responsibility for the late war as for the other evils in the world .

		Incidentally , the principle of non-resistance is dis - posed of on the best terms possible .

		Christian teach - ing creates the metaphysical puzzle as to the problem of evil by simultaneously asserting the divine good - ness and the divine omnipotence .

		Dr.
Drown	PERSON	re - jects the proposed solutions of dualism , Calvinism , and optimism .


J. S. Mill	PERSON	,
William James	PERSON	, and
H. G. Wells	PERSON	have proposed to resolve the dilemma by abandoning the claim of the divine omnipotence and saving , by that sacrifice , the divine goodness .

		Dr.
Drown	PERSON	is sympathetic toward the suggestion but shows a theologian 's reluctance to part with the traditional divine attribute of almightiness .

		God 's power must be redefined as '' moral omnipotence . ''

		God is omnipotent because goodness , right , and love are omnipotent .

		But these exclude the use of force .

		God himself is a pacifist because he can not , in ac - cordance with the principles of his moral nature , employ '' force without stint and without limit . '' ''

		If God is to produce a moral universe he can not produce it by force . ''

		But is God justified in the use of force defensively or as a means of opposing force that threatens to dominate the right ?

		Apparently not , for '' the cross of Christ becomes the sign and symbol and realization of the supreme power of God .

		In the cross is revealed the true omnipotence of God . ''

		The cross , surely , is the symbol of physical non-resistance as it is of faith in the omnipotence of right .

		But why should not force be enlisted on the side of righteousness ?

		Dr.
Drown	PERSON	seems to imply that '' with God it is impossible , but with men it is possible . ''

		Our purpose is so to use force that force shall yield to righteousness .

		We are to use force with the deep conviction that force is not the final thing .

		Force , like
John the Baptist	PERSON	, must yield to that which is greater than itself , it must prepare the way of the Lord .

		It must make straight in the desert of human life a high - way for our God .

		But is not this after all to appeal to the interim ethic of expediency rather than to stand by the abso -
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 207 An Appeal To Americans '' Receive ye , oh the captive , and let us pre - pare an asylum for mankind to dwell in . ''

		TJTINDUS are indicted under the Espionage Act in
America	LOCATION	for prop - aganda , the aim of which was to secure a different political regime for their country .

		One man ,
Taraknath Das	PERSON	, an American citizen , faces proceedings for revocation of his citizenship and possible deportation be - cause of his interest in political reform in the land of his birth .

		Deporta - tion for a Hindu nationalist ordinarily means execution by the British au - thorities in
India	LOCATION	.

		Whether or not you approve of the activities or point of view of these Hindus , they are entitled to what has always been a traditional American right , the right of political asylum , which has been offered not only to Kos - suth , but to
Puren	LOCATION	,
Rudovich	PERSON	, and numerous others who have flocked to these shores from every corner of the globe .

		Thus the continued prosecu - tion of these Hindus threatens an historic privilege and puts American courts in the position of assisting in doing the bidding of foreign govern - ments .

		While the war still continues officially , a new and special condition exists during the armistice which should give these cases a special status .

		Certainly this transitional period is no time for punishment , on ' the basis of a state of war , which might establish a precedent that may be used in all times to destroy the right of asylum in this country .

		These cases must be defended , and a defense fund has been started , with headquarters in
New York	LOCATION	, to defray the necessary expenses and to insure legal aid and protection to these men .

		Checks and post office orders should be made payable to

		STAKES OF THE WAR .

		By
Lothrop Stoddard	PERSON	and
Glenn Frank	PERSON	.

		Century ;
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		Few indeed are the reference and text books writ - ten in the early part of
1918	DATE	which have survived the moderating and tempering influence of the armistice .

		Stakes of the War is one of the few .

		Although later developments have made for a direct interest in
Siberia	LOCATION	, the
Ural	LOCATION	region of Great Rus - sia , the Chinese-Russian frontier , the book keeps its high value as a compendium of the issues and prob - lems which confront the makers of what we hope to be a permanent peace .

		Practically every other territorial , economic , and national problem that is now to be solved for better or for worse is briefly and succinctly stated in this book :
Belgium	LOCATION	, Al - sace-Lorraine ,
Schleswig-Holstein	LOCATION	,
Finland	LOCATION	and the Baltic Provinces ,
Poland	LOCATION	,
Lithuania	LOCATION	,
Bohemia	LOCATION	, the
Ukraine	LOCATION	,

Constantinople	LOCATION	,
Asia	LOCATION	Minor ,
Armenia	LOCATION	,
Syria	LOCATION	,
Mesopotamia	LOCATION	,
Arabia	LOCATION	,
Egypt	LOCATION	.


Persia	LOCATION	, and the African colonies .

		With the exception of those territories which the recent activi - ties of the
Bolsheviki	PERSON	have made of immediate in - terest , and the German possessions in
China	LOCATION	and the
Pacific	LOCATION	, all the puzzles of the
Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	are exposed .

		It is a credit to the scholarship and fair - ness of the authors that these puzzles are exposed with absolutely no partisan rancor or bias .

		The relevant facts of the case are first given , followed by simple explanations of the various proposed solu - tions .

		Bibliographies are appended for more ex - haustive reference .

		Maps and statistics are given where needed for the sake of clearness .

		There is no pretense at exhaustive treatment and no dog - matic assertion that one solution is better than an - other , although the authors do not mince words in describing a proposed solution as nationalistic or imperialistic , where it is obviously such whether proposed by the Central Powers or the Entente .

		Such a volume is of great value today , when con - flicting claims of the different nationalities are be - ing laid before American public opinion for its ap - proval and moral backing .

		Amid the contemporary currents of propaganda and carefully conducted publicity for extravagant or moderate claims this volume becomes a lucid and impartial guide .

		If it can not offer final solutions , it can and does reveal where certain pretensions are manifestly unjust or unwise , or the reverse .

		Yet even a cursory reading of the book gives rise to one unescapable convic - tion : that fully fifty per cent of the problems which are engaging the attention of the delegates at
Paris	LOCATION	can be satisfactorily solved only by some sort of in - ternational control , based on the simple philosophy of live and let live .

		So far as the book can influence our public opinion and we hope that influence will be great it will do so wholly in the direction of justice and fair dealing .

		THE GREAT CHANGE .

		By
Charles W. Wood	PERSON	.


Boni & Liveright	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		This book is a series of interviews with the '' Leaders in
American Government	ORGANIZATION	, Industry , and Education who are Remaking Civilization . ''

		It is therefore a manual of reconstruction , predigested .

		Mr.
Wood	PERSON	reflects the enthusiasm of
Washington	LOCATION	in war time when the city was a strange land filled with people working at high pressure , ap - parently of their own volition and , apparently , for other interests than personal return .

		In Mr.
Wood	PERSON	's last chapter there is a suggestion that his high hopes , inspired by his interviews with govern - ment officials , suffered a check .

		It doubtless has become evident to Mr.
Wood	PERSON	, as it has to others , in the few weeks which have passed since the sign - ing of the armistice , that these hopes were a re - flection of the war mind , of the tense anticipation of the incorrigible idealist .

		But Mr.
Wood	PERSON	does not pin his whole faith in the great change to the simple evidence of social service in war time , or to the results of state administration .

		In his inter - views with production ` managers , with
H. L. Gantt	PERSON	,
Charles M. Schwab	PERSON	, and
Walter N. Polokov	PERSON	, his economics underwent a revision .

		He saw that in the processes of production rather than in the capture of products there was the opportunity to become masters of industry . ''

		From collective bargaining , '' he says in his concluding chapter , '' workers may gradually advance to collective management ; not through any political or debating society but through first-hand acquaintance with the facts . ''

		For in - stance , he saw opportunities for realizing the eight - hour day for which labor has been organizing and contending for thirty years . ''

		I have n't yet been able to demonstrate conclusively , ''
Walter N. Polokov	PERSON	of the
Shipping Board	ORGANIZATION	told his interviewer , '' that men can do more work in six hours than they can in eight .

		Positively they can do more in six than they can do in ten or twelve ; but , owing to certain con - ditions in the plants where I tried it out , the six - hour ` experiment is still inconclusive .

		However , '' the engineer added , '' if
America	LOCATION	seriously sets out to eliminate all the friction in her industrial system we may expect a four , or perhaps a two-hour day .

		Socialism ? ''

		the author asked . ''

		Engineering , '' Mr.
Polokoy	PERSON	corrected .

		The point which the author makes , and of which his hard-headed comrades would do well to take notice , is this : if the workers ' organizations will learn how to eliminate '' all the friction '' and as - ume the responsibility of carrying production for - ward , they may become masters of wealth instead of '' a voice '' which pipes for a hearing .

		CAMPAIGNING IN THE BALKANS .

		By
Harold Lake	PERSON	.

		McBride ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		After the endless political volumes on the war dealing with world plots and world leagues , often no better than metaphysical moonshine , this simple , straightforward account of an actual campaigning experience in
Macedonia	LOCATION	elicits a sigh of relief .

		The author served in the
British Expeditionary Force	ORGANIZATION	which came to
Salonika	LOCATION	after the conquest of
Serbia	LOCATION	by the
Central Powers	ORGANIZATION	in
1915	DATE	and there he remained throughout the long period of inaction which so greatly aroused the ire of the newspaper strategists and so profoundly puzzled the general public .

		His is not a tale of the fury of battle and the exalted heroism which carries a man with his mates and his cause to the summit of existence .

		His stay in
Macedonia	LOCATION	befell exclusively in the period of gestation , in the long and wearisome days of road-making , transport organization , and other similar scientific drudgery , when the distant victory had to be prepared by the detailed and intelligent cooperation of the myriad parts of a complicated war-machine .

		The enemy opposite the front trenches hardly figures in the book ; he is quiescent more or less , glad to be let alone .

		And the British army welcomes the respite while it feverishly ap - plies itself to the job of defeating a more deadly enemy , persistent , snuggling close , Medusa-headed the wretched land of
Macedonia	LOCATION	.

		By telling just experiences , things seen and heard and felt , the author builds up an impressive picture of this in turn writhing and torpid monster of a country , and by very virtue of a sort of commonplaceness of manner , a taking for granted the sacrifices , suffer - ing , and moral courage , he erects an authentic , spiritual monument to his British kin which gal - lantly stood ground and in the end slew the
Python	LOCATION	.

		This
Macedonia	LOCATION	, synonymous these many centu - ries with trouble is there its like anywhere under the sun ?

		It rises before us in these pages , a coun - try without roads , food , or water , a country of rocks , without trees or shelter , a country scorched brown and turned to powder under a blazing sun , a country infested with flies , mosquitoes , and name - less crawling vermin a country , one should say , to cherish like leprosy .

		Across this desert land , as chance would have it , the British were obliged to dig a dike against the German flood , and out of its waste a British officer , using the direct speech of the diarist , has raised his voice to tell of the worth ef the British stock .

Marie Tudor	PERSON	.

		If the market for poetry is as limited as it is said to be , how may one account for the cunning which is lavished in masking much excellent prose in the trappings of half-fledged verse ?

		It frequently ap - pears that the poetic product is in far greater demand than we have been led to believe ; otherwise authors would not go so far out of their way to achieve it .

		There is much alloy , for example , in the poetic character of many things that carry the poetic label in Mr.
Eaton	PERSON	's latest book .

		Echoes and Realities is mainly a series of pen pictures adroit , colorful , human vignettes which he has consciously cast into rhythms by breaking up the lines into requisite lengths .

		The author has produced a volume of tasteful prose in the guise of poetry .

		In the most representative pieces he is concerned less with the inspiration than with the subject , so that his treat - ment is essentially that of prose .

		His very titles
Washington Square	LOCATION	, The Daily Paper , Skis , Town Meeting these suggest the mood of prose minia - tures , extremely graceful in their way , but their way is not the way of poetry .

		Turning to Mr.
Eaton	PERSON	's love poems , one is im - pelled to speak in another vein .

		Here he has taken the stuff of poetry , but failed to sustain it ; he ex - changes vigor and originality for too much syrup .

		There is a settled sweetness which quickly dulls the appetite .

		We find ten poems in a row -LRB- pages 89-101 -RRB- , for example , and each one is buttoned up with a kiss , like a tailored jacket .

		One hungers for '' the challenge of a soul more free and wild . ''

		With Mr.
Jones	PERSON	, this tendency to treat poetically a subject which might yield more gracefully to prose is seen in the somewhat extended poem , His Mother .

		Here the author is concerned with a psychological analysis of a mother who hears that her son is about to marry .

		Its opening line '' The first shock of the letter that she had '' displays an unrhythmic abruptness which the writer is not able to avoid in several other places .

		We feel that His Mother might have been rendered doubly effective if the impulse to put it in verse had been ignored .

		However , this poem is not representative of the ex - treme variety of mood and manner which Mr.
Jones	PERSON	has encompassed in Gargoyles .

		The title is well chosen to symbolize the grotesque visages which fre - quently peer through the thin veils of rhythmic fancy .

		The poet displays a vivid touch and a facile dominion over words ; his style is incisive rather

		For either , a group of related , intel - ligible , and competent studies leads to a well rounded result .

		He sees the uncouth contrasts of life , no matter whether it be in an abandoned cemetery or in a street car , and he possesses the deft faculty of catching that contrast on the turn of a phrase .

		The
University Sketches	ORGANIZATION	are among the most character - istic pieces .

		One will show the flavor of the style : A rag of sunset flaps my window pane With curious insistence ; memoried trees Stand up like solemn eastern devotees ; The empty campus floods with purple grain Behind them where they pray ; one cloud in vain Threatens the moon , on dim and ghostly seas Of silent weather lost ; day 's emptied lees , Spilled through the west , tinge heaven a wine-red stain .

		Papers are marked .

		The quarter 's past and done .

		Two sparrows , chattering , are very loud Where yesterday I heard a happy crowd At graduation .

		Now the belated sun Drops swiftly , and the vesper air is bowed With weight of growing stars .

		The quarter 's done .

		Of the more than two hundred poems in the Tudor collection , trickling down the pages between wide margins , we cull but one , which is entitled The Universe : Nothing in the universe is fixed , Nor God nor purpose .

		This absence of a fixed purpose may explain why after dismissing the universe in two lines the author should have devoted such a quantity of poems to subsidiary themes .

		Their creator appears to have regarded them all , however , as but so many colored beads on the thread of her ego .

		Their texture is uniformly frail ; they seem saddened by similarity .

		WHERE YOUR HEART Is .

		By
Beatrice Har	PERSON	- raden .

		Dodd ,
Mead	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		It is all very well to put psychological heroines into books , but it is unwise to keep nudging the reader 's mind to keep him aware of their psychologi - cal aspects .

		The reader is apt to be rather jealous of his own psychological aspects and among them is his aversion to being nudged .

		If
Miss Harraden	LOCATION	had kept this fact more carefully in mind , Where Your Heart Is could have been made a better piece of fiction .

		The author does less insisting than she used to do , but she still retains vestiges of her ancient fault .

		This novel is not nearly so guide - posted as , for example , her Ships That Pass in the
Night	TIME	, but the landscape is still marred by finger - posts at almost every cross-roads .

		Miss Harraden needs to sit at the feet of
Henry James	PERSON	to learn something of the art of presenting psychological heroines without recourse to labels .

		The early portions of this story are more success - ful than .

		its conclusion .

		The character of a self - centered woman , a dealer in antique jewelry and collector of precious stones , is made vivid and plausi - ble .

		Her impulses are sympathetically analyzed , and the balance between her almost fanatical covet - ousnouss and her better instincts is carefully held .

		But when
Miss Harraden	PERSON	's heroine is drawn into the war in order to facilitate her regeneration then the nudging becomes more conspicuous and the machinery begins to creak .

		Where Your Heart Is joins that numerous army of converted-by-war fiction , and ends with the author 's foot upon the soft pedal while her fingers strike the keys in the too-familiar '' carry on '' chord .

		THE DIAL A FORTNIGHTLY The Covenant and After A HE LEAGUE OF FREE NATIONS , the
League to Enforce Peace	ORGANIZATION	, the
International Alliance	ORGANIZATION	, the va - rious concepts of a better world for which we fought have taken form in the constitution of the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	, which President
Wilson	PERSON	has brought back from
Paris	LOCATION	.

		It will not be submitted to the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	until the entire treaty of peace of which it forms a part is ready for action ; but it is now submitted to the country and to the world as the basis of that treaty .

		As such it should be received with such signs of acceptance as the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	can not fail to understand .

		The expected opposition has already developed , on the part of those who are unable to think save in terms of national sover - eignty , entangling alliances , and the
Monroe Doc	ORGANIZATION	- trine .

		What is more to be feared is - the opposition or the indifference of liberals , who look in vain in the constitution for the fourteen points which Presi - dent
Wilson	PERSON	so often asserted as the condition of world peace , and therefore find themselves in a mood varying between disillusion and disgust .

		With the former , argument may be used , but it will not prevail .

		The question ^ is one of practical politics in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	.

		If the country answers , the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	will hear .

		It is to the latter , who not without cause have learned to distrust fair words and noble promises , and who by skepticism , criticism , and in - difference may confuse the answer of the country and strengthen the hands of the Tories , that per - suasion must be addressed .

		Such persuasion must be based on a consideration of the true nature of the constitution .

		And it is above all important that the great mass of liberals who may be tempted to regard the document as it stands as a complete and satisfactory conclusion of the world catastrophe be brought to a realistic understanding of the instru - ment , as a condition of uniting their forces with those of more radical critics , and making impossible a division of which the
Tories	ORGANIZATION	will be too eager to take advantage .

		First of all , it must be recognized that the Cov - enant is a blank check a form , which may be signed but will then require filling out with the figures which alone can give it meaning .

		It was inevitable that this should be so .

		The Peace Con - ference had its choice of proceeding immediately to impose a peace among the belligerents , or of drawing first the instrument which should be the basis of that peace .

		Obviously the first course would have meant a peace written in terms of the old world of national sovereignty and balance of power from which we had a chance to escape .

		The second course logically implies a peace written in terms of the new world of which the Covenant is , if it is anything , the guarantee .

		The Covenant is part of the treaty of peace .

		It will be worthy to stand or fall according to the use made of their power by the five nations which constitute the
Executive Council of the League	ORGANIZATION	, in the treaty which they will impose .

		Their handiwork is at once to be subjected to the test of their own faith .

		.

		The points on which that test will chiefly turn have already become a part of liberal criticism of the Covenant .

		In the first place , it is pointed out that the League of present conferees is no true
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	, but a perpetuation of the vic - torious Alliance that as matters stand we may find the excluded nations setting up a rival league to throw the world back into the chaos of diplomacy , preparedness , and war .

		Clearly the treaty of which the
Covenant	ORGANIZATION	is to become a part must provide for the entry into the League of the nations now ex - cluded especially
Germany	LOCATION	, including the German provinces of
Austria	LOCATION	, and
Russia	LOCATION	.

		And this in turn implies terms which make it possible for those units to resume their status in the family of nations a new family of nations of which the basis is reconciliation .

		The questions of the punishment of
Germany	LOCATION	and the conversion of
Russia	LOCATION	have been held in abeyance during the drafting of the Cov - enant .

		When they are taken up they must be con - sidered in a spirit which is in conformity with the meaning of the
League	ORGANIZATION	and which it is the object of the League to make possible on earth .

		Second , the rights of weak nations , and among these we include
Ireland	LOCATION	,
China	LOCATION	,
Mexico	LOCATION	, Jugo - slavia those nations which are particularly subject to the predatory policies of certain classes in one 220 THE DIAL
March 8	DATE	or more of the five executive nations must be be - yond any peradventure safeguarded .

		One of the defects in the constitution of the
League	ORGANIZATION	is in Article XV , which seems to permit a nation to make war , or to bring pressure equivalent to war , on another with the sanction of one disinterested member of the
Executive Council	ORGANIZATION	.

		Third , the provisions regarding the assignment of undeveloped peoples by mandate to the care of tutelary powers must be carried out in conspicuous good faith .

		The examples which the world has before it of such professed guardianship in the cases of
Morocco	LOCATION	,
Madagascar	LOCATION	,
Egypt	LOCATION	, the
Congo Free State	ORGANIZATION	, and
Korea	LOCATION	are not such as to inspire con - fidence in this form of machinery .

		So much for matters in which the nations repre - sented at the
Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	, especially the five executives , must act through their representatives in order to fill out the sketch of the League of Na - tions in such a way as to give it the color and meaning implied in President
Wilson	PERSON	's repeated ut - terances on the subject .

		There are other matters which will be left to later action of the
League	ORGANIZATION	, and which will be decided in accordance with the attitude of the several contracting nations .

		First of these stands disarmament .

		The constitution ot the
League	ORGANIZATION	is obviously vague on this point , but it is certain that here we come to the supreme or , as President
Wilson	PERSON	would say , the acid test of the reality of the whole structure .

		If nations con - tinue to pile up armament , if they permit 4 : he manu - facture of munitions to be a matter of private specu - lation and public corruption , if above all they train their populations for war under any system , Swiss or Prussian , then clearly they have not the root of the matter in them .

		Second stands the commercial intercourse of nations .

		If this become progressively free there will be supplied an economic basis of peace which will render superfluous the safeguards of the League ; but if the business relations of na - tions continue to be dictated by selfish considerations only , especially if it be the selfishness of a class , we shall have exchanged one form of warfare for an - other likely to become more terrible and desolating as the economic exploitation of the world proceeds .

		Third is the freedom of movement among peoples , not excluding Japanese and Hindus obviously a necessary condition of that mutual respect which is at the basis of a
League of Free Nations	ORGANIZATION	.

		And finally there is the matter touched on briefly in Article XX , the treatment of labor in the several nations a matter of internal administration , in which , however , the nations comprising the League may powerfully influence each other .

		It is by some such cooperative effort of democracy as that sug - gested in this article , with opportunity for direct representation of > the people in the legislature of nations , that the present Covenant may become the basis of a
League of Peoples	ORGANIZATION	.

		The most damaging criticism of the present Covenant is that it is not a covenant of peoples .

		It could not be .

		The people have no machinery through which they could be represented in draw - ing up such a document , and to this fact its obvious shortcomings are due .

		It is a
Covenant of Govern	ORGANIZATION	- ments .

		To remedy its defects , to fill in its outline , to make it a genuine and vital instrument , however , the people have a weapon which President
Wilson	PERSON	himself suggested in his
Boston	LOCATION	speech : The nations of the world have set their heads now to do a great thing , and they are not going to slacken their purpose .

		And when I speak of the nations of the world I do not speak ^ of the governments of the world .

		I speak of the peoples who constitute the nations of the world .

		They are in the saddle and they are going to see to it that if their present governments do not do their will , some other governments shall .

		And the secret is out and the present governments know it .

		The people have resolved on a great thing , possibly a greater thing than even President
Wilson	PERSON	realizes .

		They will accomplish it either through the medium of existing governments or by over - turning them .

		They understand the causes of war , and realize that they are deeply rooted in the struc - ture of a society founded primarily on the possessive instincts of mankind .

		It is the representatives and guardians of the vested interests of this society who are met in
Paris	LOCATION	to draw up the protocol for the settlement of the world .

		As was pointed out in THE DIAL of
January 25	DATE	, the all-inclusive question of the
Conference	ORGANIZATION	is still whether the forces there rep - resented can in such a world make peace at all .

		The draft of the constitution of the League does not answer that question ; it postpones it ; it may indeed become an evasion of it .

		But it will be an evasion of which men will be well aware , and they will re - sent most bitterly the action of those who have had the largest share in the deception .

		Only as a prom - ise to be redeemed in full in the terms of interna - tional settlement repeatedly laid down by President
Wilson	PERSON	and endorsed by all the Allies can the pres - ent Covenant be honestly offered or accepted .

		It is in this sense , as the basis of an alliance of all nations , an instrument of international coopera - tion among all peoples , that we accept this Cov - enant .

		Unless it is this , it is nothing .

		It is in this sense that we can call on liberals to accept it , always reminding ourselves and them that the present document is only a beginning , the first dawn of the morning , and that the burden and heat of the day are all before us .

		ROBERT
MORSS LOVETT	ORGANIZATION	.

		1919 THE DIAL 221 Reversing an Emergency H ow ACUTE MUST an emergency be to war - rant the suspension of the Constitution ?

		Or is it a question of whose emergency it is ?

		When we entered the war we lost comparatively little time in mobilizing our resources in men , in materials , in money .

		These were quickly placed at the disposal of the government ; or the govern - ment , recognizing the existence of an emergency whatever that may be established new agencies for their seizure and administration .

		Many seri - ously questioned the motivation of our entry into the war , but nobody questioned the authority of the government to assume its new powers .

		In a great emergency , it is recognized , ordinary rules and ordi - nary agencies no longer work , at least adequately .

		At such a time we depend upon the leadership of the community , whether official or unofficial , to assert itself , to override routine , and to use all necessary force to establish order , or security , or health , or whatever it is that the emergency de - mands .

		Our entry upon the war was no doubt a serious emergency .

		But with the cessation of hos - tilities the emergency is completely reversed , in certain respects .

		Yet our officials are doing nothing very prompt , nothing very drastic , to cope with the situation .

		One feature of the conduct of the war has a special significance for the future of our national policies on the economic side .

		That was the or - ganization of the administration of essentials on a comprehensive scale .

		The
Transport Administra	ORGANIZATION	- tion , the
Food Administration	ORGANIZATION	, the Fuel Adminis - tration , the
War Industries Board	ORGANIZATION	, the
Capital Issues Board	ORGANIZATION	, and many other agencies represented the principle that an essential commodity which is limited in amount and which may become the limit - ing factor in the execution of the national purpose must be controlled , on the one hand to guard against waste and dissipation or sequestration , and on the other hand to insure the most effective utilization in the emergency .

		In accepting the slogan '' work or fight , '' in * establishing the United States Em - ployment Service to administer labor power when labor threatened to become the limiting factor in the successful conduct of the war , and in the deter - mination of labor priorities , labor was treated pre - cisely the same as other commodities , and rightly so .

		All of these things mean that in an emergency it is no longer safe to leave to private initiative and enterprise and patriotism the control of national essentials .

		But suddenly the emergency is over .

		Suddenly we stop shooting shells and dropping bombs .

		Sud - denly we stop pulverizing shoes and uniforms .

		We stop manufacturing and saving up shells and bombs and uniforms and army shoes .

		Presently we with - draw restraint from the paper market and from the lumber market .

		The
War Industries Board	ORGANIZATION	is al - lowed to disband ; the
Capital Issues Board	ORGANIZATION	evapor - ates ; the
War Labor Board	ORGANIZATION	sinks into desuetude .

		It seems that private initiative and enterprise and the traditional wisdom and motivation of business can now be relied upon to produce what is necessary , as economically as may be , as promptly as our general welfare may require .

		The emergency is past .

		But a new emergency has come to replace it .

		The commodity labor , of which there was a serious shortage but a few weeks ago , is rapidly changing into a vast array of hungry men and women with no income in sight .

		The munitions factories , the uniform factories , the gas - mask factories stop producing war supplies .

		That is excellent .

		That will liberate capital and ma - terials for peace-time production .

		That , plus the demobilization , will liberate workers to look for jobs .

		And that is the new emergency .

		In the past such situations were looked upon as the emergen - cies of those directly concerned .

		In the past .

		we took official cognizance of unfortunate people 's emergencies because we were more or less humane , more or less sympathetic , more or less disposed to relieve distress .

		But now we have an uncomfort - able feeling that there is some official responsibility for meeting this new emergency .

		After all , the men and women who fought and carried on are something more than convenient supplies for the conduct of business ; they are an integral and a very considerable portion of that something '' we '' were fighting for and moreover , they will not be ignored .

		So we must take official note of the new emer - gency , and we shift it to the
Employment Service	ORGANIZATION	.

		And the
Employment Service	ORGANIZATION	, with the best of in - tentions , with the best of organizations , with the best of executives , will fail to meet the emergency .

		Then the
Employment Service	ORGANIZATION	, and the
Department of Labor	ORGANIZATION	, and perhaps the Democratic Administra - tion will be discredited .

		Indeed the very idea of the government 's interfering with what is historically a private affair will be thoroughly discredited .

		But if it fails , the
Employment Service	ORGANIZATION	will not be at fault .

		You might as well blame your refrigerator for not keeping your apartment warm .

		It is not built that way .

		It was built for an entirely different purpose 222 THE DIAL
March 8	DATE	an opposite purpose .

		No matter how good a re - frigerator it is , it can not keep your apartment warm .

		And neither can the
Employment Service	ORGANIZATION	, which was built for administering a shortage of the commodity labor , successfully reverse itself and ad - minister a shortage of jobs .

		The reason ^ or this is that , whereas the govern - ment could establish some control over the commodi - ties it undertook to administer food , or fuel , or labor as a war measure , it has no control whatever over jobs .

		The making of jobs is in the hands of those who own the machinery for production cap - ital and organization and technique .

		So long as we leave it to these , the emergency will continue with fluctuations in volume and acuteness , but it will cojntinue .

		For the job makers can afford to wait .

		There is of course a great need for goods of all kinds , but this great need is not an '' effective de - mand . ''

		That is to say , there is no immediate buy - ing ability proportionate to our potential produc - tivity .

		It is not considered good business to plow lands or build houses or weave cloth
today	DATE	because the labor cost is too high , and because labor , as market , is too poor .

		It is true that a given acre of tillage or a given mile of trackage represents the same amount of labor , whether the wage rate be one dollar or
ten dollars	MONEY	a day .

		It is true that the food and clothing required by a worker 's family in
1919	DATE	` is inde - pendent both of the wage rate and of the current prices of commodities .

		But the factors that deter - mine whether or not it is worth while to produce food and clothing and houses and roads are not the productivity of able and willing workers , nor the needs of men , women , and children .

		The determin - ing factors are the probability of profits for the undertakers and of dividends for the investors .

		So private capital is waiting for a recognized need to become translated in some mysterious manner into an effective demand ; but the workers can not waft .

		It is not merely a question of keeping idle folk occupied ; it is not even a question of furnish - ing a wage or a stipend .

		It is primarily a question of maintaining production and distribution of essen - tials .

		That is why any agency for dealing with the emergency , whether the
Employment Service	ORGANIZATION	or what not , must start something substantially like the organization of production and distribution .

		Reservoir or buffer employments will be neces - sary ; but they will not suffice .

		While we may raise enough money to pay emergency wages for such employments for many months to come , we shall be producing values that the emergency wages can not buy , that workers can not use to live on .

		If we established only emergency reservoir employ - ment , we should establish a condition of continued low wages with constantly rising prices ; but per - haps we should then be forced to recognize that we had a real emergency on our hands .

		If the present emergency concerns only discharged munitions workers and discharged soldiers , it is but the front end of an emergency that concerns the very existence of the nation .

		We must recognize quickly that there is needed an organization , on a comprehensive scale , for the production of funda - mentals that are immediately and continuously usable .

		We must recognize that we can not depend for this prompt and comprehensive organization upon those in control of the industrial and commer - cial and financial machinery of the country .

		Those in control are , from a traditional and legalistic point of view , quite legitimately taking their time until the situation is so clear that they can see profit in making jobs .

		But while they are waiting , the organisms that constitute labor , the flesh and blood of the country , are undergoing deleterious changes .

		If now we are to assume national responsibility for this emergency , instead of ignoring it , or in - stead of allowing it to be the exclusive concern of those upon whom it happens to impinge , we must first of all reestablish the various administrative bodies maintained during the war for the purpose of controlling the production and distribution of war essentials with certain important differences .

		Whereas during the war capital issues , the purchase of materials , the allotment of labor , and the assign - ment of transportation priorities were administered solely with a view to war needs , today capital and materials and labor must be administered with a view to the normal essentials of working people .

		Whereas during the war competition for workers had virtually to be prohibited to prevent the sky - rocketing of wages , we must now prevent competi - tion for jobs from knocking the bottom out of living standards .

		Whereas during the war we comman - deered labor and left to it a minimum of oppor - tunity ^ for self-direction while we merely controlled capital , we should now commandeer capital , leaving it a minimum of self-direction , while we merely guide labor .

		In short , we must now recognize that the emergency is reversed . '

		The first difference this reversal makes in any program of organized production and distribution is this : during the war we were concerned with pro- ducing to the very utmost , limiting ourselves only by such limiting factors as were beyond our con - trol chiefly shortages of essentials now transpor - tation , at another time equipment , or labor , or some special chemical ; now we should be concerned with establishing a minimum program , in the fear that 223 any excess of production would affect unfavorably those factors of national or foreign markets that furnish the prerogatives of merchants and finan - ciers .

		Because the fixing of prices and of wages would to a certain extent interfere with the specu - lative elements of investments and profits , we should undertake to produce only as little as wpuld suffice to meet the prospective needs , with the nar - rowest possible margin of safety .

		The apparently arbitrary limitation of wage de - pression is the second point of difference , and this is quite as justifiable as was the previous restriction on competition for workers .

		Under war conditions those in control of industry , whether they dealt directly with the government or with the public at large , were amply protected against excessively high wages .

		Through cost-plus contracts , or through fixed price contracts , the margin was all on the side of the capital owner .

		An excessively high wage , which strictly speaking means a wage in ex - cess of the social value of the worker 's product , may indeed have been attained in some trades ; but generally speaking the living standards of the workers of the country have not gone up unduly during the war , whereas , generally speaking , the families of the capital controlling classes have not been exposed to undue privation , and the '' earn - ings '' of capital have been of such magnitude as to lead many to confuse '' profiteering '' with the sequestration of excess profits .

		Under these circum - stances the danger of alloting to the workers an ex - cessive wage means at the worst a draft upon our material reserves ; whereas an unduly low wage would mean a draft upon our human reserve the disintegration of men , women , and children , if these stood for it long enough .

		The third difference , the determination by public agencies of the location and uses of private capital , is but another implication of our acceptance of na - tional action in an emergency .

		We took it for granted , in accepting the draft law , that at least so far as they were able officials would place each conscript where he - would be of most service .

		In the same way commandeering of private fixed capi - tal should result in placing each tractor or sewing machine or lathe where it will do the most good .

		What stands in the way of an official seizure of industrial equipment is not the fear that some fool officer might try to grind heavy castings with a spinning jenny and thus ruin a perfectly good ma - chine .

		The chief obstacle is the refusal of those in control of the government to recognize the sit - uation as a national emergency .

		That , however , is the sort of obstacle that may at any time cease to have meaning .

		The assumption of national responsibility would mean in the second place the immediate starting of all our statistical machinery for ascertaining the actual needs of the nation that is the people in the months to come .

		How much food , and what kinds , how much iron and coal and gasoline and copper and lumber , how many pairs of shoes , and how many dwellings during the next fiscal year ?

		All these things we can find out with reasonable accuracy , even if the financiers have no way of knowing how much can be profitably marketed .

		Next we can find out how much our farms and mines , our forests and factories , are capable of producing assuming organization and labor and materials and technique profit or no profit .

		And then we can find out just what private enterprise contemplates producing and when it plans to start .

		Prices being what they are , wages being what they are , visible stocks of supplies being what they are , what do you plan to do with your silk mills , with your clothing factories , with your machine shops , with your furniture factories ?

		Suppose our
War Industries Board	ORGANIZATION	, converted into a
National Safety Industries Board	ORGANIZATION	, receives from a certain munitions plant , now converted into a sport - ing goods plant , a program of the year 's production .

		There being an abundance of labor and raw material available , our board allots coal and materials to the factory .

		But a compilation of all the sporting goods reports shows that there is contemplated a shortage of tennis rackets .

		Now you can not force the manu - facturer to take any risks ; but you can undertake to manufacture a supplementary lot of tennis rackets in a commandeered and converted airplane factory .

		What is needed , in other words , as a third step , is the determination of what work must be undertaken to supplement the private voluntary undertakings .

		If there is enough machinery in the country to produce the necessary shoes , and only enough is working to meet half the needs , we must start enough additional machinery going to supply the other half .

		If private capital is too timid to take the risk , it may waive its profits while the machinery turns out peace essentials .

		This means the fixing of wages for workers in terms of living costs and living standards .

		It may mean the fixing of prices that leave too little profit .

		The fixing of wages in terms of prices would tend to stabilize wages .

		This would be embarrassing ` to the manufacturer whose program for the year was based on the hope that wages would drop speedily .

		But the fixing of prices might bring its compensations .

		At any rate , we shall eventually have to choose be - tween making unwilling capital serve the nation at what its owners consider inadequate pay , and leav - ing willing but unemployed workers to their own 224 THE DIAL
March 8	DATE	devices .

		As to the former alternative , we do not know what constitutes adequate compensation for the service of capital ; empirically it is anything be - tween zero and several hundred per cent .

		And as to the latter alternative , we do not know to what devices idle workers and outraged soldiers may re - sort .

		But we do know , or can easily enough find out , what lands and materials and machinery are required for producing the consumable utilities of the coming year ; we know where the machinery and the materials and the workers are located .

		The matter is not altogether a simple problem in arithmetic ; there are many variables and many un - certainties .

		There is the possibility that private cap - ital will discover that it is not as timid as it had feared itself to be , and that it will then come forth to steal labor away from government undertakings by the offer of higher wages .

		There is the possibil - ity that workers -LRB- even unemployed workers -RRB- have already discovered that what they used to consider good jobs are today beneath their notice .

		There is the possibility that unforeseen importations will leave the relatively high-priced domestic products on our hands , too valuable to throw away , but too `` ex - pensive '' to use up .

		But all of these possibilities mean that an emergency is an expensive proposition ; that does not need to be decided .

		What needs to be de - cided is , who is to pay the cost ?

		Shall it be the re - turning soldiers and the discharged second line ?

		Shall it be the next generation , forced to liquidate long term bonds ?

		Shall it be the few who are both wealthy and generous ?

		Shall it be those who have accumulated war profits beyond all decency ?

		The fact is that not one of these classes can bear the cost , however much it may wish to .

		To carry the cost means to produce continuously , and that requires workers , plus organization , plus equipment , plus technique .

		Heretofore we have depended upon the owners of equipment and credit to furnish the or - ganization and to employ labor and to exploit tech - nology .

		The present emergency means that the own - ers of capital are not ready to start .

		Some other agency must do the starting , the national govern - ment or those who feel it to be their emergency .

		There are here then four important questions : 1 .

		Have we enough resources in the way of mate - rials and tools and machinery and fluid capital -LRB- or credit -RRB- to employ all willing men and women in a producing organization ?

		2 .

		Have we available the intelligence , the expert knowledge , and the executive ability requisite for effecting such an organization ?

		3 .

		Can such an organization produce enough to maintain the corresponding portion of the popula - tion , and carry its overhead costs ?

		4 .

		Is the organization of capital for the purpose of enabling available workers to produce and to main - tain themselves and their dependents a matter of national importance ?

		It is only the fourth of these questions that re - mains open .

		It is the whole question whether un - employment , however extensive or enduring , is or is not a public emergency , is or is not a strictly pri - vate matter .

		When we recognized the existence of an emer - gency that called for more labor than came forward voluntarily , we knew how to conscript the additional service .

		Now that the emergency is reversed , shall we have the vision and the energy and the courage to cope with it ?

		That is , shall we have the vision and the courage and the energy to continue conscript - ing , whatever and whomsoever may be needed , until the emergency is past ?

		That depends on whose emergency we think it is .

		1919 THE DIAL Ten Times Ten Make One M
R. JAMES BRANCH CABELL	PERSON	of
Virginia	LOCATION	, genealogist and twentieth century jongleur of let - ters , now amuses himself by giving his fourth dimen - sional arithmetic its official textbook , Beyond Life : Dizain des Demiurges -LRB- McBride ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- .

		This charming act of concession may or may not be a good thing for the future of the romantic and gossamer science thereby made manifest .

		In any event , I mean '' charming '' in all literalness abhorring sarcasm on this subject , and leaving it to the really professional reviewer who reviews with - out having read .

		At first glimpse , the concession seems one of humorous despair , whereby Mr.
Cabell	PERSON	offers to make himself over , body and soul one group after another having refused him on whatever terms to the cults and the coteries , which remain hitherto as blankly oblivious of him as the newspapered and Saturday-Evening-Posted multitude itself .

		This would be , for the author of Gallantry and The Line of Love , a dreadful form of suicide , compara - ble to the self-extinction invoked by vice-presidents and the husbands of famous women .

		But what Mr.
Cabell	PERSON	has done , and notably done , in Beyond Life is to make an extension into philosophy of his artifice , perhaps also of his art .

		I do not know that even the most enterprising - of his detractors has ever made any very serious attempt to convict him of a deficit in the sense of purely artistic unity .

		He is nothing if not the workman , the welder .

		Even in his volumes of tales Chivalry , the Dizain des
Reines	PERSON	; The Certain Hour , his Dizain des Poetes ; Gallantry , the Dizain des Fetes-Galanr .

		es ; and The Line of Love , which started out to be the
Dizain des Mariages	PERSON	, and was thwarted only by Mr.
Cabell	PERSON	's failure to have discovered at that early period '' the decimal system of composition '' even in these volumes of ostensibly separate tales , there is inflexible unity of design , an interweaving of parts patterned into a whole by composition , point of view , a selective principle , singleness of esthetic and philosophic accent .

		With these belongs this newer volume , Beyond Life , the Dizain des Demiurges , ten essays of the same calculated and preordained harmony , each essay coaxed into ten neat sections strung together and fitting like verte - brae , all the essays and all the sections falling into nicest adjustment to disclose a philosophy of life wrapped round a philosophy of letters .

		It is the book of a man in whose supernal mathematic ten times ten always make one , and one only .

		The central unifying speculation of the book is that the history of conscious life may be only an essay in romantic fiction , contrived by an all-power - ful author who uses men and women , rather than written words , as his symbols .

		It is a romantic , not a realistic , essay , because the demiurge or world - shaping principle is nothing other than romance .

		The universal human instinct for romance which , I take it , would be the Cabellian defense of the supposition that man is made in the image of his author expresses itself in a set of '' dynamic illu - sions '' or '' vital lies , '' each an elaborate denial of the factual truth about life , and a fashion of accept - ing things not '' as they are '' but '' as they ought to be . ''

		The crowning merit of these dynamic il - lusions is that , one and all , they work , whereas nothing else does work .

		They improve the race , better the shape and composition of the world it inhabits , hasten and control its evolution away from the ape , enlist it on the side of the angels .

		Man has the faculty of '' playing the ape to his dreams '' ; he '' can , actually , acquire a trait by assuming , in defiance of reason , that he already has it . ''

		To exemplify : The love of the sexes is such a dynamic illusion , one of the chief of man 's incite - ments to noble emprise . ''

		When you come to judge what he -LSB- man -RSB- made of sexual desire , ap - praising the deed in view as against the wondrous overture of courtship and that infinity of high achievements which time has seen performed as grace-notes , words fail before his egregious thauma - turgy .

		For after any such stupendous bit of hocus - pocus , there seems to be no limit fixed to the con - jurations of human vanity . ''

		The epic of
Chris	PERSON	- tianity is another triumph of romance , the most staggering of all : it is the tale of
Cinderella	LOCATION	and the Prince in a cosmic translation .

		And all religion creates dynamic illusions based on human vanity ; it whispers to man that the gods are interested in him and his doings , and he , moved by the pretty fiction of a reward in eternity , does the best he knows how on this bank and shoal of time .

		Also he abstains from doing : for virtue , which is '' vic - torious resistance to one 's vital desire , '' a '' daily abstention from being ' true to life , ' '' res `` ts im - plicitly on the expectation of being '' paid ... in a transfigured life to come . ''

		-LRB- This , says Mr.
Cabell	PERSON	, is religion 's use of '' that venerable artistic convention , ' the happy ending . ' '' -RRB-

		Patriotism , a demiurgic product especially valuable in war-time , is '' undefiled by any smirch of ' realism ' or of that which is merely ' logical ' '' ; it is an anesthesia for saving us from truths which would drive us in - 226 THE DIAL
March 8	DATE	stantly.mad if honestly faced , such as that `` presi - dents and chief-justices and archbishops and kings and statesmen are human beings like you and me and the state legislators and the laundryman . ''

		Whence the '' mythos '' built up round each of our great men , '' so as to save us from the driveling terror that would
spring	DATE	from conceding our des - tinies in any way to depend on other beings quite as mediocre and incompetent as ourselves . ''

		And then there is the most potent and pervasive of all demiurgic forces , plain human dullness .

		It keeps the average man convinced of the ultimate value of '' common sense , '' of doing '' practical '' things ; it keeps us one and all perpetually con - vinced that life , however aimless and wasteful and unsatisfactory at this moment , is certain to be al - together different by week after next .

		And '' finally dulness it is that lifts up heart and voice alike , to view a parasite infesting the epidermis of a midge among the planets , and cries , Behold , this is the child of God All-mighty and All-worshipful , made in the likeness of his Father ! ''

		Thus , throughout , the demiurge compels us to interpret life as it is not , and thereby spares us the dementia of seeing it as it is ; it enables us to exist .

		Having done that , it enables us to progress , on our maker 's grand scale as the artist in fiction does on his tiny scale , toward '' the auctorial virtues of distinction and clarity , of beauty and symmetry , of tenderness and truth and urbanity . ''

		And , of all that is , no jot has come to be except by virtue of '' this will that stirs in us to have the creatures of earth and the affairs of earth , not as they are , but ' as they ought to be . '

		> : This will about which we talk is romance , the demiurge ; but `` when we note how visibly it sways all life we perceive that we are talking about God . ''

		However clear the general purport of this philosophy , as a restatement of the truism that life is somehow making game of us , there is somewhat in its detailed applications to ruffle the sense of logic .

		One wants the doctrine because it is , how - ever subordinately , a born artist 's doctrine of art to achieve indubitable clarity on the main esthetic point .

		That point is the authenticity of '' romance '' and the spuriousness of `` realism '' ; and precisely that point is left without any very exact locus .

		Beyond Life , unlike life , teems with definition ; but , through the piling up of definitions that do not agree , it leaves its major terms as undefined as those of life itself .

		The major terms here are '' romance '' and '' realism . ''

		Almost from begin - ning to end of the book , romance is understood to be the acceptance of life as it ought to be , realism the acceptance of life as it is .

		Romance , dynamic illusion , the demiurge , is - the friend of the race , the summum bonum , the author of all effort , all achieve - ment ; realism , or insistence on the factual truth , is the inveterately inimical and destructive principle .

		And then , behold !

		we land with a thud against the astounding assertion that the crowning imbecility of realism in fiction is its endeavor '' to show our actual existence from a viewpoint wherefrom no human being ever saw it '' that is , the viewpoint which penetrates and analyzes , which excludes what it can of bias , which portrays the dynamic illusions not as the eternal laws of truth and beauty , but simply as emotion and predilection objectively ex - isting in the characters ; the viewpoint of
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	, of Conrad and , I must add , at the risk of in - furiating a writer to whose work I , for one , warmly respond the viewpoint of Mr.
Cabell	PERSON	himself in every book he has yet signed .

		Now , if no human being does actually see life from this angle I pass over the question how on earth , if no one does , The Cords of Vanity and
Beyond Life	ORGANIZATION	and
Madame Bovary	ORGANIZATION	and Une Vie and Nostromo have contrived to exist if the dynamic illusions are the whole sum of normal consciousness , and presenting the facts '' as they are '' is '' precisely the one indiscretion which life never perpetrates '' ; if all this is so , why then of course it is '' romance '' which turns out to be the servile and effortless copy of factuality , and by the same token it is this very decried '' realism '' which alone takes imagination , expands the province of consciousness , changes the shape , the boundaries , the very center of the world each of us inhabits ; it is realism only , in fine , which is the authentic ro - mance .

		That this may indeed be so is the one valid jus - tification of realism , the realist 's all-sufficing apologia .

		If all of us are swaddled in illusion , then the only adventure left is the effort to get rid of the wrappings , see ourselves stripped , and perceive at last how infantile we really are .

		To do so may be , in fact , the one way for us to get our growth that growth toward the stature of archangels on which Mr.
Cabell	PERSON	more than once compliments the race .

		That this is the function of realism some of us have always contended .

		The fact that much pseudo-realism has got no deeper than the pimples on the skin of life has remained , in the words of Mr.
Cabell	PERSON	's
Charteris	PERSON	, '' the art of being super - ficial seriously '' has really nothing to do with the question .

		If .

		Mr.
Cabell	PERSON	's
Charteris	PERSON	, who has to perfection the art of being serious superficially , were to ask what I mean by realism , when the question is of literature and not merely of glib journalism masquerading as the art of fiction , I might very in - 1.919 THE DIAL 227 telligently answer that I mean The Cream of the Jest and
The Cords of Vanity and Beyond Life	ORGANIZATION	.

		The net result of these books , and of their neighbors on the same shelf excepting , perhaps , The Eagle 's Shadow is to shrink the domain of illusion and faith and to expand that of disillusion and sight .

		What criticism there is in this continent simply can not afford longer to wage its war against the falsities without acclaiming the addition to its ranks of such a master of strategy as Mr.
Cabell	PERSON	.

		His present defense of the illusions of romance is the most insidiously damaging attack on them ever printed .

		And therein it is of a substance with his other work : indeed , philosophically it is little more than a hauling-together and piecing-out of fragmentary meanings from all of them .

Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Herrick	PERSON	,
Rudolph Musgrave	PERSON	,
Wycherley	PERSON	,
Sheridan	PERSON	does Mr.
Cabell	PERSON	show these men '' as they ought to be '' or '' as they are '' ?

		He is far beyond pampering his own illusions about them , whatever theirs about life .

		And what dynamic illusion is it , one wonders , which drives him to the ruthless exposure of his own illusions as fast as he can detect them ?

		Not , it would cer - tainly appear , a wholesome love of viewing himself as he ought to be , nor yet that overmastering desire to play the part which is expected of one , to which .

		he rightly ascribes much of the waste and tedium of our unsocial society .

		His posture of an enemy to realism and an apologist of human sentimentalism must assuredly be , then , the cream of a prodigious jest .

		It pleases him , here , to ignore the abysmal difference in kind and consequence between the sentimental self-deceptions of gross minds , and the idealizing urge of a fine temperament toward '' dis - tinction and clarity , beauty and symmetry , tender - ness and truth and urbanity '' ; the difference , say , between stupid conformity to what is expected of one , and his own idealized vision of that conformity as being no mean part of the demiurgic force .

		Yet that difference , which he understands better than any American who ever put pen to paper , is the all - important thing , and every nerve of his artist 's tem - per vibrates constant recognition of it .

		You really can not account for his words some of them except as the words of a man with his tongue in his cheek .

		Mr.
Cabell	PERSON	does in fact carry his tongue in his cheek rather persistently of late : one hopes and trusts it is not going to surfer the untoward mishap of tongues , and persons , that venture where they do not strictly belong .

		I mentioned Mr.
Cabell	PERSON	's apparent overture to the cults and the coteries ; and indeed he does become , since The Rivet in
Grand	LOCATION	- father 's Neck , very special , very tricksy , very ex - clusively and -LRB- shall I say ? -RRB-

		ostentatiously given to pleasing the most whimsical part of himself , and other considerations be hanged .

		But the real dan - ger , after all , is not that the faddists will injure his future by taking him up ; it is that , by limiting himself more and more narrowly to ingenious mock - eries , he will injure it himself , and with it more than he can possibly conjecture of the
next quarter	DATE	- century of letters in
America	LOCATION	.

		If this seem a fanci - ful speculation , consider that
Mark Twain	PERSON	missed something of his due place by an almost lifelong conformity , and
Ambrose Bierce	PERSON	something of his by a progressive embitterment .

		Those who think they understand
Cabell	PERSON	do not wish to see him the victim of a withdrawal into the most intricate passages of his own personality not even if - that would multiply delights for themselves .

		That is , then , the danger that he is by way of becoming his own coterie .

		For himself , that would be all beer and skittles and the best o ' company .

		What an in -- dividual , for example , is that one segment of
Cabell	PERSON	named
John Charteris	PERSON	-LRB- who , by the way , has evi - dently moved from
Lichfield	LOCATION	to
Fairhaven	LOCATION	since
Jasper Hardress	PERSON	killed him in The Rivet in
Grand	LOCATION	- father 's Neck -RRB- , the man who talks the essays of
Beyond Life	ORGANIZATION	straight off between nine of a
May	DATE
evening	TIME	and five of the next morning , in a study lined with such things as The Complete Works of
David Copperfield	PERSON	, The Novels and Tales of
Mark Ambient	PERSON	, The Works of
Colney Durance	PERSON	, The Collected Essays of
Ernest Pontifex	PERSON	, the last six cantos of
The Faerie Queene	ORGANIZATION	, and the latter Can - terbury Tales , to an interlocutor who plagiarizes the favorite argument of the professional reviewer by failing to understand exactly what it is all about .

		But what I am thinking of is not the greatest pos - sible fun for Mr.
Cabell	PERSON	: what I am thinking of is the richest possible yield to a modest number of the rest of us .

		A fantastic possibility to close on is that
Cabell	PERSON	may achieve popularity , notices , plaudits , editions , with this inherently and deliberately least '' popu - lar '' of all his books .

		It is reported that Mr.
Felix Kennaston	PERSON	's Men Who Loved
Alison	PERSON	achieved sales through a blundering allusion which everyone but the author perfectly comprehended ; it would be hardly less fantastic if
Beyond Life	LOCATION	were instantly to enrich its publisher on the strength of the adver - tising matter at the back of the book .

		Possibly to lend color to his theory that dullness is the final arbiter , Mr.
Cabell	PERSON	has included eight pages of journalistic comment on his own work , all of it maudlin almost beyond human credibility , and clos - ing with the assurance of the
New York	LOCATION	Sun that 228 THE DIAL

		If these eight pages were to do for the author what some three hundred and sixty of his own resplendent prose could not do , life would have committed a truly Cabellian jest transcending laughter or tears . ''

		A good book , '' the title-page quotes , '' is the precious life-blood of a master-spirit , embalmed and treasured up on purpose to a life beyond life . ''

		WILSON
FOLLETT	ORGANIZATION	.

		Two Latter-Day Hamlets I N THE AVERAGE AUDIENCE that attends a per - formance of Hamlet there are represented , roughly speaking , three distinct types .

		First of all there are the persons who attend from a sense of self-educa - tional duty .

		These constitute almost but not quite one half of the audience .

		Then there are the persons who thoroughly enjoy either the poesy of the lan - guage or the beauty of the stage pictures or both .

		These make up a comfortable half of the audience .

		Last of all there is the handful of discriminating Shakespeare lovers , to whom Hamlet is a great salient , vitalizing , and humanizing fact , to be care - fully studied and pondered over and fathomed as far as one can fathom the unfathomable ; and these attend because to hear the lines rendered with any - thing approximating adequacy is as breath in their nostrils , and because they hope to find in each suc - cessive interpretation some new intrinsic but hither - to undiscovered beauty .

		Or , if they have made a very close study indeed of the greatest of plays , they hope , by some miracle , to witness the manifestly im - possible a perfect interpretation .

		Why manifestly impossible ?

		The answer is simple enough .

		Impossible because Hamlet is a creature of moods and in the quick flux of his vari - ability it is doubtful whether he himself if the Hamlet of the play had had a historical prototype would have given utterance to the same words in the same way when the wind was '' north-north - west '' and when it was '' southerly . ''

		For there is perhaps more truth in
Hamlet	LOCATION	's words that he is but mad '' north-northwest '' than has been generally observed .

		The north-northwest wind of intense and intensive anger and righteous wrath certainly whips him to the very brim of the chasm of mad - ness ; the southerly wind of philosophic rumination shows him to be infinitely saner than the man irv the marketplace who deems the multiplication of shekels the only philosophy worth knowing .

		The first task of the actor who essays Hamlet , therefore , is to pluck out of the shifting quicksands of temperament Hamlet 's essential character , and to bend his energies and his talents to the achieving of a portraiture of the essential as it shows through the veils of rapid transitions , and to shape those transitions in such wise as to produce a unity of impression .

		Is Hamlet mad ?

		Half-mad ?

		Wholly sane ?

		Was his love for
Ophelia	ORGANIZATION	real love or merely a passing fancy ?

		If real , in what estimation did he hold her mentality ?

		Her character ?

		Did he think his mother an accomplice to the murder ?

		The ques - tions which suggest themselves could be multiplied a hundredfold .

		An enormous mass of stage tradition accrues to
Hamlet	LOCATION	.

		No actor of any note has ever attempted to play the part without injecting into it some new business , intended to aid visualization of the lines or to lend emphasis to some usually unobserved point .

		The contributions of
Burbage	LOCATION	,
Garrick	PERSON	,
Kemble	LOCATION	,
Kean	PERSON	,
Fechter	PERSON	,
Booth	LOCATION	, Forbes-Robertson to this tradition are recognized by all students of the actor 's art .

		It is against this background that every new Hamlet is projected , and every one chal - lenges memories of the greatest actors in the greatest part on the English stage .

		The two new Hamlets who appeared simul - taneously in
New York	LOCATION	during this season can not be praised too highly .

		Nor can they be compared save for the purpose of bringing into clearer relief the conception of each actor ; for integrally , tempera - mentally the Hamlet of
Fritz Leiber	PERSON	and the Ham - let of
Walter Hampden	PERSON	are situated at emotional antipodes .

		Leiber 's Hamlet is intrinsically a pathetic , wist - ful , lovable , and high-bred gentleman .

		His melan - choly shows so gentle a complexion that if the time had not been out of joint it might have been worn by him as nothing more ostentatious or corrosive than a mental mannerism or eccentricity .

		Words can not adequately describe the poetic beauty with which he invested the Suicide Soliloquy , of which he delivered himself leaning upon the arm of the Queen 's throne .

		There was no violent start after the words '' to sleep , perchance to dream , '' but he shifted his position slightly , as a man who is deeply preoccupied will unconsciously do .

		The problem
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 229 interested but did not agitate him .

		With the Ghost he was tender , reverential , and unterrified .

		His reading of the line '' Angels and ministers of grace defend us '' was indicative of a nervous shock , of amazement , of bewilderment , but not of fear .

		His Hamlet followed the precedent set by
Fechter	PERSON	, and held the hilt of his sword the sign of the cross between himself and the Ghost in following the '' questionable shape . ''

		As he himself had experi - enced wonder but no fear upon seeing the Ghost , this protective action was probably employed as a concession to the fear of Horatio and
Marcellus	PERSON	.

		The words '' Alas , poor Ghost '' were vibrant with filial feeling and sheer human pity .

		The scenes with Guildenstern and
Rosencrans	PERSON	were unduly truncated , the second , the Recorder Scene , being entirely omitted .

		The two '' adders fanged '' were thereby rendered even more wooden than usual .

		Leiber has been criticized for not de - veloping sufficient sparkle in these scenes and in the lighter scenes with Polonius , but his deliberate , al - most slow reading of the lines was quite in keeping with his portrait of a creature so fundamentally gentle that even to say an unpleasant thing was an unwelcome labor .

		There was nothing spontaneous in his malicious raillery of Polonius .

		His unami - able replies seemed to be wrung from him in the vain hope that Polonius , being tartly answered , would at last cease pestering him .

		In handling Guildenstern 's medallion , this pervasive gentleness was again apparent .

		He did not fling the damning miniature in Guildenstern 's face , ^ but handled it with a gesture of profound contempt , as something too despicable for anger .

		Once only did white-hot anger flare up like a rocket in
Leiber	LOCATION	's Hamlet upon the discovery of , the '' lawful espials . ''

		Then he was stung to the quick , and the turbulence and tumult with which he berated Ophelia were the impotent fury of an ingrainedly gentle creature driven to desperation by a series of damnable treacheries .

		N , ow and then there came a rift in the storm-cloud of his black - visaged rage , and he stretched out his arms yearn - ingly to the woman whom he still loved although she had failed him so lamentably .

		In no other scene was the pathos , the cruel , harrowing soul-lone - liness of Hamlet more exquisitely suggested .

		Leiber 's Hamlet did not play the Play-Scene violently .

		He had set the puppets in motion , and awaited the outcome in profound but veiled excite - ment .

		Some of
Leiber	PERSON	's finest work was done in the Closet Scene .

		He came into the room crying '' Mother , Mother , Mother '' with a crescendo of feeling which gave a harrowing notion of the out - rage worked upon his filial feelings by his remain - ing parent .

		It showed that the deep well of his affection had been poisoned but not dried up by his mother 's shame .

		It was the cry of a tortured , spiritually stricken creature , and the unearthly beauty of tone in which Leiber spoke , or rather cried , these three words can be indicated but not described .

		In the speech comparing
Claudius	PERSON	and his father ,
Leiber	PERSON	's Hamlet pointed throughout to the medallion which he wore and to a portrait sup - posed to hang upon the wall .

		This is one of the most ticklish scenes of the entire play , and it is to be deplored that
Leiber	PERSON	, who is grace personified when in a natural pose , stood almost throughout this scene in a cramped and unnatural position .

		In the fencing scene
Leiber	PERSON	's Hamlet caught the foil as it fell from
Laertes	LOCATION	' hand by making a wild dash for it , thereby showing that he suspected treachery .

		Mercifully the audience was spared the entrance of Fortinbras and his opera-bouffe crew .

		This excision was in the best of taste and an innova - tion for which to be devoutly grateful .

		Leiber 's Hamlet has the unequivocal charm in - herent in poetic delicacy , refinement , and breeding .

		He is not so much a prince as a gentleman .

		When
Horatio	PERSON	said of Hamlet 's father , '' He was a goodly king , ''
Leiber	PERSON	's Hamlet flung back , '' He was a man ! ''

		He slightly emphasized the word '' man , '' as if to be a man , in every virtuous sense , was far more than to be a crowned head .

		Compared with
Leiber	PERSON	's Hamlet , which is pitched throughout in the minor key , the Hamlet of
Walter Hampden	PERSON	shows the vigor , the freshness , the domi - nance of a triumphal procession of major chords .

		Hampden 's Hamlet is not a wistful , brooding , essentially sane Hamlet .

		There is in him a decided straining toward the danger-mark of madness .

		He has not yet crossed the line of demarcation but he may .

		He is not so much a potential poet , a gentle - man of cultured tastes , as a royal prince .

		He is a man in whom exceptional mental endowments , turned awry by the course of events , have assumed a corrosive virulence which is eating into the very marrow of mind and soul .

		He is a man capable of prodigious endeavors .

		But his energy , real enough while it lasts , spends itself with the celerity of an alcohol-fed flame .

		His mentality is impetuous and creative .

		But it lacks organization and fixity of purpose and thus becomes sterile .

		Hampden possesses a voice of rare , rich sonorous - ness , a figure perfectly suited to the part , lithe grace of movement , and great freedom of limb .

		Not once did he fall into an ungraceful posture .

		He is for - tunate in having a superb supporting caste , which enables him to make many fine `` points which are usually slurred .

		.

		230 THE DIAL
March 8 Hampden	DATE	's Hamlet is a very princely , masculine Hamlet , and it is characteristic of the interpreta - tion in its entirety that he made Hamlet 's friendship for Horatio far more convincing than his love for
Ophelia	ORGANIZATION	, and that , while he placed the greatest pos - sible emphasis upon his love for the murdered king , the queen aroused in him only a passion of aversion and condemnation , but no conflict in his soul .

		Hampden 's Hamlet probably thought
Gertrude	PERSON	an accomplice in the murder .

		His tempestuously vo - ciferated '' Almost as bad , good mother , as kill a king and marry with his brother '' lends warrant to this assumption .

		The Ghost Scenes were played as probably no generation since
Garrick	PERSON	has seen them played .

		Hampden thoroughly impressed upon his audience the dreadful , portentous nature of the Ghost 's visi - tation .

		His '' Angels and ministers of grace defend us '' sent a chill of apprehension down the spine ; and his '' I 'll call thee Hamlet ,
King	PERSON	, father !

		Royal Dane ! ''

		were replete with a gracious , thrilling solemnity and with a filial affection which could not have been bettered .

		After the word '' father '' he changed the reading of the text so far as to come to a full stop , throwing into the one word a world of palpitating love and tremulous rever - ence .

		In following the Ghost , he dragged his sword after him , as if fully convinced of the Ghost 's '' honesty , '' but wary lest
Horatio	PERSON	and
Marcellus	PERSON	, in all loyalty and devotion , attempt to drag him away once more .

		The Ghost , let it be parenthetic - ally remarked , was quite the handsomest and most convincing ghost yet seen on our stage .

		The cere - ments which he had burst seemed to swathe him , making him indeed an astonishing apparition .

		Hampden 's Hamlet , like Irving 's , resorted to the use of tablets after the Ghost had left him .

		His excitement verged on hysteria , and
Hampden	LOCATION	's re - markable histrionic ability shone with spectacular brightness in the brief scene which follows between
Horatio	ORGANIZATION	,
Hamlet	LOCATION	, and
Marcellus	PERSON	.

		He contrived , by an art so flawless that it is impossible to dis - sect it , to convey the impression that Hamlet re - fused to impart the Ghost 's mission only because he and
Horatio	PERSON	were not alone , and that he intended to tell
Horatio	PERSON	all about it at the earliest possible moment .

		The grim humor displayed by his irrever - ent appellations of the Ghost as '' old true-penny '' and '' old mole '' were self-evidently caused by his exultation that his soul had not been a false prophet .

		Very touching , very beautiful , and very sincere was his use of the sword hilt as a cross , held almost upon the very ground , as he said , '' Rest , rest , perturbed spirit ! ''

		He pronounced these words as a mother may speak words to soothe a frightened child .

		The inflection of his voice made of these three words a sublimated lullaby .

		Hampden , very properly , retained the second the Recorder scene with Guildenstern and Ro - sencrans .

		In the earlier scene he was very - cross with Guildenstern and all but spanked the medallion into his face , so that
Guilden	PERSON	- stern , quite '' affrighted , '' involuntarily drew back .

		In the scene with the players
Hampden	PERSON	introduced a pregnant bit of business .

		There was in this com - pany of players a young lad who later , in the Play Scene , spoke the Prologue , which is usually omitted .

		Upon this lad 's pate the clown of the company rapped soundly apropos of nothing , bringing upon himself Hamlet 's rebuke , '' And let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them , '' for which the clown , when
Hamlet	ORGANIZATION	's back was turned , made a '' mow '' at the prince .

		Hamp - den 's treatment of Polonius was almost as deliberate as
Leiber 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		With
Leiber	PERSON	, deliberation fitted into the picture , but
Hampden	LOCATION	's Hamlet , to be con - sistent , demands greater spontaneity in this scene .

		In the three great scenes which apply the touch - stone to an actor 's qualification for the part ,
Hamp	PERSON	- den acquitted himself superbly .

		His reading of the Play Scene , the Closet Scene , and the Scene with
Ophelia	ORGANIZATION	was stupendously dynamic and moving .

		The scene with
Ophelia	PERSON	he played without a break that is , he gave no indication of having be - come aware of the '' lawful espials . ''

		He seemed to mistrust Ophelia from the outset , from the very moment when she offered to return his tokens and letters , just as he mistrusted Guildenstern and
Rosencrans	PERSON	because he discovered the medallion with the miniature of the king hanging from
Guilden	LOCATION	- stern 's neck .

		He gave the impression throughout the scene of a mind so harrowed and harassed by continual brooding upon a Ztuanffsidee that , for the nonce at least , the value and the sanctity of love had receded in his mind to a coign of signal disadvan - tage .

		The sight of Ophelia distressed him because he realized that his love for her , if given free reign , might divert him from the awful business in hand .

		His wild words were rendered more wild by his manner .

		He was guilty of downright incivility to his lady .

		He rushed frantically to and fro .

		Tow - ard the close of the scene , he flung off the stage and back again , frequently beginning the opening words of his clue while off stage .

		He was plainly semi - hysterical , and the frenzied words rushed from his lips like a cascade over a cliff .

		He was a human tempest , a whirlwind incarnate , fury embodied .

		As a lover he was terrifying , and poor Ophelia the most timid , shrinking , little violet sort of an Ophelia that we have ever seen was simply scared out of
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 231 her wits .

		The whole scene was a magnificent tour de force .

		In the Play Scene his nervous excitement tran - scended all bounds .

		He was all movement , all fire and flash and dash .

		He was here and there and nowhere and everywhere .

		He was elemental as the incoming tide is elemental , and quite as irresistible .

		He was ubiquitous as a sea of fire from whose every point a myriad tongues of flame rear themselves simultaneously .

		Very fine , very fine indeed was the stage management of this scene .

		Claudius , who , strange to say , was not the odiously repellent , be - tinselled , gilt-paper crowned , red-whiskered , hideous toy-king whom we have been , accustomed to , feut a man of sufficient presence and attractiveness to make his fatal fascination upon the seeming-virtuous queen quite plausible , asks Hamlet , after the first half of the play , '' Have you heard the argument ?

		Is there no offense in it ? ''

		And Hamlet , approach - ing the throne , replies with an exaggerated air of innocence , '' No , no , they do but jest , Poison in jest ; no offense i ' the world . ''

		The air seemed fairly to vibrate between this uncle-father and nephew-son who hated each other so bitterly after this passage at arms .

		One could sense the true situation .

		Claudius , by this time , had seen enough of the play to know that Hamlet was lying , and Hamlet knew that
Claudius	PERSON	knew and did n't care tuppence , because
Claudius	PERSON	, without giving himself away then and there , could not possibly refuse to allow the play to continue .

		Then , when the climax came , and
Claudius	PERSON	, angry and troubled , rose with his queen and court and left the lobby ,
Hampden	LOCATION	's Hamlet gave vent to a joy rendered terrible by the now potent impulse toward revenge underlying it .

		There remains the test of the Closet Scene , and in this also
Hampden	LOCATION	showed a superlative achieve - ment .

		He discarded all by-play with miniatures and panel portraits while drawing his comparison between the two brothers , and delivered the speech standing upright , his eye fixed on vacancy , as if seeing there the image of his murdered father .

		Hav - ing stabbed through the arras , and not knowing whom he had killed , he took the solitary candle with which the apartment was lighted , and with it in his hand investigated his deed .

		He was not over-tender with his mother , justifying the Ghost 's solicitude for her , and at the end of the scene , when
Gertrude	PERSON	offered to embrace him , he drew back , as
Fechter	PERSON	had done before him , and , also like
Fechter	PERSON	, pointed sternly to the miniature of the dead king suspended from his neck .

		His solemn - ity throughout this scene was deeply impressive .

		In the fencing scene ,
Hamlet	LOCATION	, being pricked by
Laertes	ORGANIZATION	' unbated sword , plucked his sleeve with a look of perplexity , the perplexity being succeeded almost immediately by certainty of Laertes ' treach - ery .

		When Laertes was disarmed , his foil fell upon the ground .

		Before Laertes could recover it , Ham - let placed his foot squarely across it , at the same time offering Laertes his own bated foil .

		Laertes , willy-nilly , was bound to accept the proffer , leav - ing the unbated , poisoned foil for Hamlet 's use .

		In this final scene , as in almost every scene through - out the entire play ,
Hampden	LOCATION	's marvellous ability to externalize emotion and thought illuminated points which heretofore were ineptly considered ob - scure or a matter of indifference .

		In conclusion : Both interpretations are beauti - ful with the surprising beauty of perfectly polished and perfectly set gems .

		To continue this metaphor ,
Leiber	PERSON	's Hamlet may be likened to the delicate iridescence of the opal , with its amazing complexity of elusive , interpenetrating , subtly pervasive color .

		Hampden 's Hamlet scintillates and flashes like a diamond , and like a diamond wears the mantle and the insignia of accepted supremacy .

		Leiber 's Hamlet is primarily a poet , a dreamer , a philos - opher , and a gentleman .

		Hampden 's Hamlet is chiefly , authoritatively , self-consciously , and unfor - gettably a prince .

		Leiber 's Hamlet is an exquisitely wrought pastel ;
Hampden	LOCATION	's Hamlet a vigorous can - vas in oil , in which gorgeous color runs riot .

		Leiber 's Hamlet partakes of the mysterious , chaste witchery of an intaglio , lucid but not sharp , distinct yet sub - tly veiled , so that its outlines may be seen clearly yet with the delicate elusiveness of a landscape shrouded in mist .

		It is mellow rather than bril - liant , subtly suggestive rather than emphatic and direct .

		Hampden 's Hamlet on the other hand possesses the incisiveness , the detached , clear limning of the cameo .

		He is splendid like a sun-burst , but the haunting loveliness of star and moonlight is not for him .

		Which of the two actors presents the real Ham - let ?

		Who can say !


Hazlitt	PERSON	said , `` It is we who are Hamlet . ''

		There are many species and sub - species of We , and as
Hamlet	LOCATION	sits enthroned in the universal soul , and the universal soul is a myriad souls , there must be , logically reasoned , not one but many true Hamlets .

		Moreover , appreciation of a Rodin marble does not preclude admiration of Greek sculpture .

		The same mind , conceivably , may find infinite food for reflection and infinite esthetic satisfaction in meditating upon The Hand of God and the
Laokoon	LOCATION	.

		Small minds may read in dis - paragement of the unfavored , praise for the favored , but the versatile mind is grateful for manifold and diverging varieties of beauty .

		LlDA C. SCHEM .

		232 THE
DIAL March 8 Nationalism	ORGANIZATION	.

		HE BREAKING-UP of
Austria-Hungary	LOCATION	and of
Russia	LOCATION	has emphasized the difference between a na - tion and a nationality .

		It has become evident that unity of racial descent does not bring about na - tional cohesion , and that distinct racial elements may combine and form a nation of great solidarity .

		We also recognize that between the members of a nationality language is a firmer bond than race , although it does not necessarily coincide with na - tional boundaries .

		Since at the present time we lay great stress upon the rights of nations , it seems desirable to obtain a clear understanding of what we mean by the unity of a nationality .

		In order to answer this problem , we must understand the basis of all actions based on social solidarity .

		In early times mankind was divided into small hordes or tribes that lived in iso - lation and in constant fear of enemies , beast as well as man .

		Whoever was not a member of the tribe was a potential enemy , a being of a different order that was chased away and slain , if he did not yield .

		Al - though this condition in its extreme form has never been observed among primitive people , it may be inferred with high probability .

		Its remnants may be recognized even in language , as when the term '' man '' is used only for the members of one 's own tribe , all foreigners being called , like animals , by specific names ; or when an Indian tribe designates by one grammatical form only the adult males of that tribe , while the rest of the world belongs to a different category .

		The extreme hostility against the stranger , which characterizes the be - havior of many primitive tribes , and the utter dis - regard of the stranger 's life all point to the early feeling of specific difference between the member of the horde and the outsider .

		In the progress of times contact between the isolated bands became more frequent and economic life developed in such a manner that no tribe was entirely independent of all its neighbors .

		Thus the feeling of specific dif - ference gradually wore off and , although the at - titude towards the stranger retained a background of hostility , a certain amount of mutual toleration developed .

		Behavior , however , continued to be based on the existence of a contrast between the tribe and the outsider .

		A person may struggle against other members of his own band and defend his own interests .

		Against strangers he reacts first of all as a member of the tribe and defends himself against real or supposed encroachments by defend - ing the social unit to which he belongs .

		We have not progressed far beyond these limits .

		Human interests that know no national boundaries have increased .

		Art , science , and commerce form ties that bind together mankind regardless of na - tionality , but nevertheless there persists the con - trast between members of different national groups that makes it right for one nation to promote the well-being of its own citizens regardless of the ef - fect that its actions may have upon the rest of man - kind , to set their welfare higher than that of others , and to look with poisonous envy upon the growing powei * and successes of members of foreign nations .

		Group solidarity has expanded from the small horde or tribe to communities of ever increasing size .

		This development has not been steady , for periods in which large and heterogeneous masses formed units that acted conjointly against foreign groups were followed by others in which the large struc - tures disintegrated , the smaller units forming cen - ters from which new , larger social units developed .

		The history of the
Alexandrian Empire	ORGANIZATION	, of
Rome	LOCATION	, of the Spanish World Empire illustrates the growth and decline of large communities .

		The develop - ment of the modern European states from the dis - integrating tendencies of feudal times and from the rise of independent cities , illustrates another phase of expansion of the smaller units into larger ones .

		In all cases of group solidarity the unifying force is the will of the members of the group to maintain their society against foreign groups .

		In its simplest form this mode of action of man as a member of a social group is strictly analogous to that of a herd of animals that maintains the integrity of its habitat against other herds .

		It is the instinctive feeling of the unity of the herd or pack that is manifested by all gregarious animals .

		In many cases , as among modern primitive tribes , the analogous reaction is entirely spontaneous and automatic .

		It may be observed that the less automatic their reaction , the more will people endeavor to reason out their motives ; and the more automatic a reaction , the less will there be felt any need of a reasoned interpreta - tion .

		Among primitive tribes the actions springing from the solidarity of the tribal group are so little conscious that they do not call for explanation and the rights of foreigners are no subject of thought .

		It is not difficult to see that the same instinct con - tinues to sway us .

		Under normal conditions the family is a loose unit in which each member goes more or less his own way .

		If , however , a member of the family comes into conflict with outsiders , the natural reaction is for the members of the family to stand together .

		When a gang of youth infests a
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 2 33 city street , it will not allow other gangs in the same street .

		The stronger the feeling of solidarity in the group and of sameness of form and purpose of the conflicting groups , the more violent are also their reactions against one another .

		In more complex social units in which conflicting social instincts make the social affiliations less auto - matic and more often determined by choice , the sub - ordination of the individual under a social group becomes the subject of retrospective thought and in - terpretation and thus assumes forms and shades of meaning that obscure its instinctive origin .

		It may be called allegiance to a race , to the personality of a chief or family , to a god , or to an ideal .

		The sub - stratum on which it arises is always the same in - stinctive social reaction .

		We shall attempt to characterize those elements that set off nationality from other similar units .

		One of the main difficulties in the way of clear un - derstanding of the significance of nationality lies in the confusion between the aims of a nation and of a nationality .

		The nation is the state and national feeling is bound up with the political power of the state .

		Nationality and state do not need to coin - cide .

		The nationalities comprised in a complex state may have political aspirations and may strive to become independent states .

		The question must be answered : what constitutes these nationalities ?

		They are not adequately defined as racial or lin - guistic units .

		It is helpful to observe how the concepts of both '' nation '' and '' nationality '' are reflected in differ - ent classes of a population .

		In most modern states in which compulsory education prevails both ideas have permeated the whole body of the people .

		Not so in simpler communities .

		It is not so very long ago that the mountaineer of the southern
Appalach	PERSON	- ian region had the vaguest ideas only of the
United States	LOCATION	as a nation , and that his social interests rather centered in his family group .

		There are many re - gions in
Mexico	LOCATION	in which the very existence of Mexi - co is unknown and where the social interests of the people are confined to the village of their fathers .

		The feeling of national political unity requires first of all a knowledge of the nation and its work .

		In all large units , the existence of which is not mani - fested in the narrow cycle of everyday life , this knowledge must necessarily be based on education .

		The self-consciousness of nationalities is similarly restricted .

		When a knowledge of communities of different speech , habits , and appearance is - lacking , the feeling of differentiation between small units must necessarily prevail .

		When communities of alien descent , of foreign language , or of unfamiliar customs are known , the feeling of relationship of those who are the same in race , language , or custom may develop .

		The limits of modern nationalities are not determined by these elements , for nationali - ties include people who show marked differences in all these respects .

		The habits of life , speech , and bodily form of the Sicilian peasant are quite dif - ferent from those of the Venetian peasant , and there is little that he has in common in his conduct of life with the Florentine artist or scientist , or with the Roman politician .

		The Galician and the Cata - lan peasants and the Spanish scientist , merchant , and laborer ; the peasant of the
Provence	LOCATION	and of Nor - mandie , and the educated Parisian ; the Swabian peas - ant , the Frisian fisherman and the German com - poser and scientist have little in common .

		In the most strongly localized groups , as in the peasantry , modern nationality exceeds the experience of daily life and can become conscious only by edu - cational agencies that originate outside of the social group .

		In those groups of men that deal with science , art , and commerce , which are in their na - ture essentially international , the idea of nationality is more restricted than the universality of interests which is prominent in their daily life .

		In neither group does it
spring	DATE	from everyday experience .

		It is fairly obvious that in modern times the na - tionalistic feeling can not be separated from the desire for political power at least for the power of a group to shape its own mode of life according to its own wishes , for the right to use its own lan - guage , follow its own customs and formulate its own laws .

		Therefore nationalistic aspirations are nowhere stronger than in suppressed nationalities .

		The Poles in
Russia	LOCATION	and
Prussia	LOCATION	; the
Danes	LOCATION	in north - ern Schleswig ; the Irish ; the Flemish in
Belgium	LOCATION	; the Bulgarians in old
Servia	LOCATION	; the Germans , Slavs , and Roumanians in
Hungary	LOCATION	; the Germans in the Bal - tic Provinces of
Russia	LOCATION	; the Lithuanians ; the Ruth - enians in
Galicia	LOCATION	all exemplify this condition in which the consciousness of nationality attains its strength by the resistance to new forcibly imposed forms of life .

		In these local phases the nationalistic feeling is easily intelligible because it is based on the reaction against outside interference on the part of a fairly homogeneous group that is held together by common language , customs , and interests .

		At the same time these areas present problems of national antagonism in many cases not capable of solution .

		Where national boundaries are fairly sharply drawn and permanent , a cleavage along national lines would solve most conflicts .

		These conditions prevail along the Franco-German boundary in
Alsace	LOCATION	and
Lorraine	PERSON	, in
Schleswig	LOCATION	, in
Belgium	LOCATION	, in the islands of the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	that are politically not affiliated with the countries whose language 234 THE DIAL
March 8	DATE	they speak as in
Cyprus	LOCATION	, a Greek community gov - erned by
England	LOCATION	; perhaps also in
Corsica	LOCATION	, an Ital - ian country governed by
France	LOCATION	.

		All through east - ern
Europe	LOCATION	conditions are quite different , because no sharp national boundaries exist .

		This is an effect of the peculiar historic changes that occurred during the Middle Ages .

		After the period of Teutonic migrations Slavs had occupied what is now east
Germany	LOCATION	as far as the
Elbe	LOCATION	.

		With the close of the migrations , the growth of stable agricultural com - munities , and the development of individual land - owning , the period of slow eastward colonization set in which gradually transformed the Slavic East into German territory .

		Somewhat later similar movements began among the western Slavic people , particularly the Poles who colonized eastward .

		The effects of these movements which continued through centuries and which are not entirely closed yet , have been a slow infiltration of Slavic territory by Ger - mans by which the more western countries were by degrees transformed into purely German districts , while eastward there are first found small enclaves of Slavish people in German territory , farther east a somewhat equal representation of both linguistic groups , and still farther east German centers in a Slavic population .

		By the same process
Prussia	LOCATION	has been Germanized , and
Lithuania	LOCATION	has been covered with German agricultural colonies and cities .

		The infusion of Poles into Lithuanian territory and of Poles into Russian areas proceeded in the same way .

		Somewhat analogous are conditions in
Hungary	LOCATION	where also clearly defined national boundaries are lacking .

		In southwestern
Russia	LOCATION	and the
Balkan Peninsula	LOCATION	a similar permeation of different nation - alities exists , but due to other historical causes .

		.

		The settlement of the Qermans in the western Slavic territory and the general influence of West - European civilization upon these countries gradual - ly strengthened the self-consciousness and economic strength of the East-European peoples .

		At the same time the current of eastward colonization began to ebb , with the result that the distribution of colonies became more stable and we have what we might call a fossilization of the process of colonization , result - ing in a half colonized territory in which the dif - ferent groups live side by side .

		According to the political affiliations of the area , the one or the other of the nationalities tries to force or resist further colonization .

		Thus in German
Poland	LOCATION	German colonization was favored and Polish speech sup - pressed .

		In Russian
Poland	LOCATION	both Polish and Ger - man were suppressed by the Russians .

		In Galicia Ruthenian was suppressed by the Poles ; in Lith - uania both German and Lithuanian were sup - pressed by the Russians .

		None of the nations in the mixed territories confines itself to the de - mand of freedom of its own speech , but endeavors at the same time to gain political control and to subject the members of other nationalities to it - self .

		The chief complaint of the Bohemians is not that they have not freedom of their own speech , but that they can not sufficiently effectively shackle the large German districts of
Bohemia	LOCATION	and
Moravia	LOCATION	as in earlier times the Germans tried to impose German upon the Bohemians .

		The violent demand of the Poles for the control of Cholm , which is Ruthenian territory partly colonized by Poles , illus - trates the same point .

		In Courland and
Livonia	LOCATION	with their German cities , Lithuanian peasantry , Polish colonies , and recent Russian accessions , the struggle is even more complex .

		In these regions the problem will never be solved as long as the struggle for domination on the part of one language over the others remains .

		Self-determination of nationalities has no meaning there , because up to the present time the only question at issue is which people shall coerce the other to adopt a language and customs that they do not want .

		As long as the modern nationalistic attitude lasts , there is only one conceivable solution of this problem , namely a separation of nationalities , by which the linguistic groups can be placed in sep - arate areas by means of a forced legal exchange of land and residence .

		Although this exchange would also entail great hardships , these would seem small and temporary as compared to the constant struggle that is now disturbing the peace of all areas of this character .

		In another way a reconstruction of this kind has been made before .

		Owing to the transfers made by marriages and other causes , the lands of the peasants in western
Germany	LOCATION	had come to be located in many isolated patches that were difficult to work .

		This condition has been largely modified by a forced exchange which , naturally , found much resistance but was nevertheless an indispensable condition for the well-being of the peasants .

		Psychologically quite different are the sources of national feeling in countries that seek national unit -RCB- 7 , not to free themselves of the yoke of foreign mas - tery but in an attempt to break down barriers be - tween those who are of the same nationality and who are separated by political boundaries that have no nationalistic meaning .

		These feelings prevailed with particular intensity in
Germany	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	be - fore each became a united state .

		Among the Poles , Greeks , Servians , Roumanians , Lithuanians and Lit - tle Russians they are complicated by the feelings engendered by the intermingling of nationalities to which we referred before .

		In an uneducated person who has no historic per - spective and no knowledge outside of that which
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 2 35 his daily experience presents to him , the aspiration for national unity could not possibly arise , because it must be based on a unity of feeling that does not manifest itself in a tangible form in daily needs and wishes .

		We have already seen that the Sicilian `` and the Venetian , or the Bavarian and Westphalian peasants , if they should meet and converse solely in regard to matters of everyday life , would find so little in common that the feeling of national unity would not arise on this basis .

		The relation of the Sicilian to the Friulese or Romansh , of the
Bavar	PERSON	- ian to the Dutch , corroborates this view .

		Administra - tive regulations making difficult intercourse between neighbors may have fostered the desire to do away with artificial boundaries , but it does not account for the intense desire for national unity .

		In the cases of
Italy	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	it is particularly clear that two sources have molded this feeling : the memory of times in which the nation had great political power and the desire to bring back these times ; and the consciousness that a certain literature and art is the common property of all those who constitute the nation .

		These are the expression and at the same time the outflow of a mode of thought which is felt by the nation as its very soul .

		Ideals of this kind can arise in the educated class only and we see , therefore , that national feeling is always based on the efforts of the educated to impress na - tionalistic ideas upon the mass of the people ; school and literature constantly cooperate to keep alive and strengthen these ideals .

		How thoroughly the concept of national unity de - pends upon the educated class is illustrated by Pan - Slavism .

		The knowledge of the relationship be - tween the Slavic languages is a result of philological inquiry .

		There is no community of interests be - tween the different Slavic groups .

		To , the unedu - cated Russian peasant the South Slavs are non-exist - ent , or , if he hears about them , they appear as a foreign nation .

		The same is true of the Czechs , while to the Little Russian the
Pole	LOCATION	is better known as an enemy than as a member of the same nation - ality .

		There is no community of historical , literary , or religious interest in these groups .

		The cultural history of
Bohemia	LOCATION	and
Poland	LOCATION	has developed quite differently from that of
Russia	LOCATION	.

		Whatever may have led to the growth of the Pan-Slavistic idea , it can have grown up only among the educated classes .

		Its growth is similar to the attempt of
Louis Napo	ORGANIZATION	- leon who tried to collect , under the leadership of
France	LOCATION	, the Romance-speaking people of
Europe	LOCATION	as opposed to the Teutonic and Slavic groups .

		The artificial origin of this idea is clear , because it has never been transposed into a strong popular feeling .

		In these two cases the supposed unity is a construc - tion based entirely on philological data , without any national cultural background .

		In the cases of true nationalities the local differ - ences are overlaid by the consciousness of a com - munity of political history and of cultural achieve - ments that are the property of the whole nation .

		In the consciousness of the Italian the greatness of
Rome	LOCATION	, both in the history of antiquity and in the history of Christianity , is a leading idea that makes him long for national greatness ; and Italian litera - ture and art are the common property of the whole people of which they are proud .

		This is no less true of
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Without the memory of
Germany	LOCATION	's po - litical history , without the works of the great Ger - mans , there would be no German nationality .

		The works of the past in which men find strength and solace are not the same for every nation , and a feel - ing of brotherhood arises in those minds whose fires are kindled by the same sparks of genius .

		For these reasons nationalism in large states can - not flourish unless it is continually rekindled by edu - cation , and preached in and out of season ; and for these reasons it finds its home chiefly among the edu - cated classes , while the masses merely follow the impetus that is given to them .

		It might be thought that common political activ - ity a * s members of a state , and particularly common dangers encountered in warfare , bind the members of a state together , but it seems that this is the case .

		to a very limited extent only .

		Political dissension is often a dissolving agent rather than a unifying force , and the rapidity with which fellows in arms fall apart and enemies join hands shows the weak - ness of fellowship engendered by war as compared with the stability of national sentiment .

		Modern nationalism is based on the dogma that political power and national individuality are insep - arable ; that a people that is politically weak can not develop a strong national individuality ; that a peo - ple that is politically strong must also be a strong nationality .

		The history of civilization proves this belief to be entirely erroneous .


Italy	LOCATION	's greatness be - longs to the period of political dissension , to a time when numerous small independent states prevented
Italy	LOCATION	from being a great political power , but when intellectual life was a unit notwithstanding the atomization of political organization .

		The period of
Germany	LOCATION	's greatest achievements in the domain of art and literature coincided with the lowest ebb of
Germany	LOCATION	's political power .

		Turkey , on the other hand , although a political power of great magnitude , has never developed into a powerful na - tionality , and only with the decadence of its politi - cal greatness has there been the beginning of a na - tional life .

		It is true , however , that under favor - THE DIAL
March 8	DATE	able conditions political greatness may strongly stimulate national life .

		When the forces of a na - tion are centralized in one focus and when the great minds are attracted to the center of the state and form a nucleus that persists for long periods , the soil for cultural progress and for the development of a strong national individuality may be exception - ally favorable .

		These conditions have given to
Paris	LOCATION	its position in the life of
France	LOCATION	and in the history of human civilization .

		The many local cen - ters of
Italy	LOCATION	of the Renaissance and of
Germany	LOCATION	of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries prove , however , that political centralization is not a neces - sary condition for an active and fruitful cultural life provided the small centers can draw upon the mental resources of a numerous people that have the same cultural background .

		The conditions for the development of economic life would seem to be more closely connected with the political power of nations , because the field of economic activity is almost everywhere restricted by legislative discrimination against the foreigner , while its full development requires free access to the resources of large territories and the opportunity of unrestricted distribution .

		The more nations are in fear of having their food supply cut off by hostile neighbors , the more difficulties they encounter in free access to foreign countries , the more they are bound to pro'ect and foster their own resources and the more strongly develops the sense of the com - munity of interests of the nation .

		If this is super - added to the feeling of cultural unity , the character - istic imperialistic tendencies of modern times de - velop , which are dominated by the desire for economic and political power .

		The cultivation of national cultural ideals has lit - tle in common with these tendencies , and in the purest national fervor there is no tinge of the lust of dominion that characterizes imperialistic nation - alism .

		It is merely the expression of the intense de - sire to develop freely the national cultural ideals .

		It seems a curious contradiction that the educated classes who have the widest knowledge of the world and who are alone in a position to appreciate the achievements of foreign nations , should be everywhere the carriers of imperialistic nationalism .

		This phenomenon is not difficult to understand if we remember that the historic facts on which na - tionalistic feelings are founded and the emotional setting in which they are presented are impressed upon the educated classes much more vigorously and persistently than upon those whose period of scholarship is short and irregular and who are not subject to similar influences out of school .

		It is a general observation that when a segregated class exists which is subject to its own special traditions , it will set class interests higher than general human interests which are always , even in simple tribal life , present among the mass of the people .

		The nation is a segregated class in this sense .

		The characteris - tic feature of nationalism is that its social and ethi - cal standards are considered as more fundamental than those that are general and human , or rather that the members of each nation assume that their ideals are or should be the true ideals of mankind .

		On account of the long subjection to these influ - ences , the thought of those whom we call the edu - cated classes is controlled essentially by those ideals which have been transmitted to us by past genera - tions .

		Particularly among the heterogeneous poor population of our cities , that is tied to the past only by the slightest bonds , a vigorous and persistent propaganda is necessary to arouse strong patriotic emotions .

		We may , then , decline to accept the teachings of an imperialistic nationalism and still be devoted to the ideals of a nationality .

		The problems of mankind are manifold and their solution is diffi - cult .

		They may be approached in many different manners and satisfactory solutions may be found by different lines of approach .

		The same solution is not satisfactory to all minds , but what is dear to one will always remain repugnant to another one .

		The character of a person is molded by the social medium in which he lives and his ideals and wishes reflect the national temper .

		Progress results from the peaceful struggle of national ideals and endeavors , and from the knowledge that what is dear to us is for that reason not the best for the rest of mankind , that we may cultivate our most valued ideals with - out ever harboring the wish to impose them upon others unless thay adopt them by their own free will .

		This thought has been clearly expressed by
Eduard Meyer	PERSON	, who says : `` Very gradually , in course of the ascending historical development , and at first half unconsciously , develops the feeling of a closer relationship , the idea of the unity of a people .

		Its most elevated form , the concept of nationality , is the most refined and complex structure that can be created by historical development ; it transforms the unity that actually exists into the conscious , ac - tive , and creative will to be and to live as a unit specifically distinct from all other social groups . ''

		In other words , the background of nationality is social individuality that neither brooks interference from other groups nor possesses the wish to deprive other nationalities of their individuality .

		Conceived in this way nationality is one of the most fruitful sources of cultural progress .

		Its pro- ductiveness lies in the strength that the individual
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 2 37 derives from being able to act in a large homo - geneous social group which responds readily to his thoughts and actions because he shares with it the same cultural background .

		There is no doubt that the greater the social group , the greater will also be the effectiveness of the response and its cumula - tive influence .

		For this reason the state and na - tionally organized society have seized upon the na - tionalistic idea and make it .

		the dominant tone of public education , not only in compulsory , state-sup - ported schools , but also in private schools , by im - pressing upon the teacher the importance of instill - ing national ideals into ^ the minds of the children .

		In this lies undoubtedly a danger for cultural progress .

		First of all the kind of nationalism that is taught is not the nationalism of ideas but the imperialistic nationalism of political and economic power ; it is not the nationalism that endeavors to understand and appreciate foreign patterns of thought , it is the in - tolerant nationalism that sets its own kind over and above every foreign form of feeling .

		Only too often is the dogmatic adulation of national political and cultural form and ill-concealed contempt of for - eign forms impressed upon the plastic minds of the young , whose lifelong behavior is thus determined .

		A further danger lies in the uniformity of pat - terns of thought that is the result of this type of education , and which in modern times , is still fur - ther sustained by the daily press and by public ora - tory .

		The attempt of the
State	ORGANIZATION	to set definite ideals for its system of education is a hindrance to cultural advance .

		In every country it tends to stabilize exist - ing conditions and hinders progress by preventing the development of independent habits of thought .

		The more rigidly the system is confined to the teaching of national ideals and the more - intolerant it is of foreign ideals , the more unfavorable must be its influence upon the growing generation .

		It is true that the greater the mass of people imbued with one dominant idea , the stronger will be their reaction to its emotional appeal .

		In former times , religion was the chief sentiment thus appealed to , a sentiment that transcended all boundaries of na - tionalities and appealed here to Christians , there to Mohammedans , without regard to language , race , or national affiliation .

		During the present period it is the national feeling that makes the strongest appeal and finds the readiest response , because it is cultivated with the most refined means of education and is constantly kept before our minds .

		Its natural basis is the common interest of the people in the his - tory of their ancestors , in the participation of all in the work , pleasures , and ideals of truth and beauty that are expressed in the work of the great men of the nation and that influence the life of even its humblest member .

		From these forces we can not escape , even if we wish to do so .

		There is ,
Jiow	PERSON	- ever , a fundamental difference between the teaching of intelligent love of our national environment that must be the basis of fruitful action , and the playing upon the sentiments of the young by teaching de - votion to nebulous symbols of greatness that elicit only passionate reaction and prevent the growth of constructive ideas .

		Love for our nation does not exclude admiration of foreign modes of life ; it should not blind us to an intelligent under - standing of the basis of our own life , of its merits , and of its defects .

		The one-sided emphasis laid upon the attempts to secure a purely emotional devotion to our social , political , and geographical environment is liable to produce an unwholesome uniformity of thought .

		A safer basis might be reached if it were our en - deavor to give an intelligent basis to our devotion to our country , balanced by an appreciative under - standing of the reasons why other nations are equally devoted to their countries and to their ideals , and if the greatest freedom were given to the teach - ing of social and political ideals .

		It is a sign of weakness to dread that critical attitude towards the basis of national institutions which is the only basis of sound progress .

		2 3 8 THE DIAL
March 8	DATE	The Drama of Self - Deception .

		MONG THE CLASS of brainworkers whom the
British Labor	ORGANIZATION	party has recently declared to be eligible for ~ membership within its ranks there is a group of young women writers who have distin - guished themselves by their precocious achievements .

		In fact some of them are still too young to vote , un - der an election law which requires the woman voter to have reached the age of thirty .

		Fortunately the English publishers do not enforce such a high stand - ard of maturity as the election officials .

		Otherwise we should have been deprived of much brilliant and able work notably that of
Rebecca West	PERSON	,
Clemence Dane	PERSON	, and
E. M. Delafield	ORGANIZATION	.

		The brainwork of
Miss Delafield	LOCATION	is characterized , among other things , by a very high rate of speed : she has published three novels in less than three years .

		It is furthermore characterized by a brilliant and relentless accuracy in the observation of her special field .

		Miss
Delafield	ORGANIZATION	has an extraordinarily keen vision for the drama of self-deception in which the ego plays the double role of actor and audience .

		She understands the game of hide-and-seek with motives which , as Sincere
James	PERSON	says to
Zella	LOCATION	, does n't take in the other people half as often as one thinks .

		In
Zella Sees Herself	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- Knopf ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , the heroine 's passion for posing assumes a rather harm - less form , so far as other people are concerned .

		It is her personal tragedy that even the most stupid eventually see through her .

		She is an arch-pretender who simply can not help it and who is always catch - ing herself in the act the unhappy victim of her own self-consciousness .

		She moves from one en - vironment to the other , always conforming to stand - ards which in her heart she despises , because with - out conforming one can not compete , and without competition one can not excel .

		At all costs she must out-Herod Herod ; she must prove the pathos of every occasion .

		At her mother 's funeral , in her aunt 's family life , during her convent days -LRB- Miss Delafield certainly knows the convent from the in - side -RRB- , at ' home and abroad ,
Zella	PERSON	revels in her artificial emotions and uncurbed phantasies .

		The climax of her indulgence in the pleasures of unreal - ity is reached when , as the Misunderstood Woman , she encounters the Misunderstood Man , and the two mutually outpose each other until they hover on the brink of marriage .

		This lover is brutally diagnosed by Sincere
James	PERSON	, whose keen insight is doubtless stimulated by the impulse of jealousy .

		It 's all derivative his whole ego .

		It 's like a mirror lying on a table ; it ca n't help reflecting all the things within range , on its own perfectly hard , flat surface .

		Pick it up and smash it , and there 's nothing left of the reflections , and nothing behind .

		The description might be applied to some extent to
Zella	LOCATION	also , but Cousin
James	PERSON	is not the man to apply it .

		In fact , he can not endure in a creature of his own sex the same qualities for which he can make excuses in one of the opposite sex .

		It is per - haps for the same reason that
Miss Delafield	ORGANIZATION	pre - fers to castigate the practice of self-deception among women rather than among men .

		At any rate , she is prone to allocate the attribute of sincerity to the husbands and male cousins in her stories .

		In The War Workers -LRB- Knopf ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , she satirizes the use of patriotism as a cloak for personal and emotional aims of an altogether different nature .

		The dominating qualities of
Miss Vivian	PERSON	, Director of the
Midland Supply Depot	ORGANIZATION	, and the adoring at - titude of her staff of Voluntary Workers form the center of the comedy .


Charmian Vivian	PERSON	, thirty years old and unmarried and previously a daughter in the home , now manages all the war work of her district , voraciously absorbing each new enterprise canteen or what-not which springs up in her neighborhood .

		She treasures in her mind 's eye a picture of herself as the indefatigable and self-sac - rificing leader , and her one aim in life is not to spoil the picture .

		Her bedazzled staff is conveniently en - thralled by the same view of her : `` Miss Vivian always puts the work before everything , '' they earn - estly chorus .

		`` She never spares herself , so why should she spare any of us ? ''

		Miss Vivian never had time to go to lunch and she never got home to dinner before nine o'clock ; she signed every letter herself and jealously guarded every detail to the outermost ramifications of her exacting job .

		Her exhausted staff was sent out at the end of the long day 's work for evening service in canteens and troop - train stations and they went unquestioningly .

		There was a
Hostel	ORGANIZATION	in which `` Miss Vivian 's own work - ers '' lived , sweltering together in an atmosphere of adulation , which receives a slightly pathological accent from the figure of poor little masochistic Miss Plumtree with her eager confession : `` But even if one does n't like her awfully much , she has a sort of fascination , do n't you think ?

		J always feel like a a sort of bird with a. sort of snake , you know . ''

		A striking contrast to the voluntary workers is the delightful
Miss Collins	PERSON	, the expert stenographer , one of the few paid workers in the office .

		Miss
Collins	PERSON	scorned the uniform and presented herself daily in silk stockings , transparent blouses , and sundry jewelry .

		She received two pounds ten shil - lings a week , never worked overtime , and had every
Saturday	DATE
afternoon	TIME	off .

		In due course of time , when all the staff , including the Director , succumbed
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 239 to the influenza epidemic ,
Miss Collins	PERSON	was the only one who escaped .

		For her the author reserves a dif - ferent fate .

		Of the 400,000 war marriages contracted in
England	LOCATION	, the author hands one to her favorite ,
Miss Collins	PERSON	; and she even carefully excludes it from the 390,000 which have remained childless .

		Miss
Collins	PERSON	receives a place among the upper ten thousand .

		`` She 's probably going to be of more use to the nation , let me tell you , than all the rest of you put together , '' blusters the pompous Dr. Prince .

		Into the Adamless paradise of the
Hostel	ORGANIZATION	, there enters the serpent in the form of a new secretary .

		Literal and unimaginative , the newcomer takes an objective view of her chief and perpetrates lese majeste in numberless small ways .

		But it is not Miss Jones who really seeks the downfall of Miss Vivian .

		The real enemy is
Char Vivian	PERSON	's mother , who stands on a footing of intimate warfare with her only daughter .

		Against Char 's circle of adorers her mother is able to muster some deadly forces of her own .

		She has the family doctor on her side , who , because he helped to bring Char into the world , feels himself privileged to call her a `` conceited monkey '' in talking with her secretary .

		She has the irrepress - ible
Lesbia	PERSON	, who drops in at the Director 's office and tells her candidly , as her `` mother 's greatest friend , '' that she is `` behaving like an absolute little fool . ''

		Then she has Sincere Cousin
John	PERSON	, who turns up at the canteen and tells the errant daughter that her place is at home with her invalid father .

		These persons are all infected with the implacable dislike which Lady Vivian cherishes for her unmanageable daughter and which unmistakeably breaks out in a secret , ardent wish : `` Oh , why in
Heaven	ORGANIZATION	's name did n't I whip
Char	PERSON	when she was younger ! ''

		There is only one thing wrong with Miss
Delafield	ORGANIZATION	's satire in this book : unlike
G. B. S.	PERSON	and
Thackeray	PERSON	, she has n't enough to go round .

		For the caddish doctor , the priggish cousin , and the vindictive mother , she has none to spare .

		It is all spent on the patriotic hypocrisies of
Miss Vivian	PERSON	, who , like
Carthage	LOCATION	, must be destroyed .

		In The Pelicans -LRB- Knopf ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- the author takes sides with the younger generation .

		The Pelicans is a drama of maternalism .

		Mrs.
Tregaskis	PERSON	, who has brought up three girls , knows how it feels to be a mother .

		`` It 's all give , give , give on one side , and take , take , take on theirs .

		I feel rather like an un - fortunate pelican feeding its young , sometimes . ''

		But pathos is not , after all , her note .

		She is 1 practical , breezy , possessive .

		Having only one daughter of her own , and sighing for more worlds to conquer , she increases her family by the adoption of two orphans .

		In describing the fate of the two sensitive , high - strung girls under the dominion of `` Cousin Bertie , '' the story often rises from satire to tragedy .

		It is so when little
Frances	PERSON	, submissive by nature , finds her way into the convent and among the nuns , who praise her for `` 1 ` habitude de 1 ` obeissance . ''

		With a horrible smugness , Cousin
Bertie	PERSON	congratulates herself that she knows where her ward picked up the habit .


Frederick Tregaskis	PERSON	, who is a Live and Let Live husband , now and then asserts himself in an attempt to make his home safe for democracy , though nothing ever comes of it .

		But at least he bequeathes to
Hazel	PERSON	, the daughter of his disposition , the spirit to make , at the age of nineteen , a great discovery .

		`` I used to think if one 's parents forbade a thing , it became impossible , ipso facto , but it does n't .

		They just cant do anything at all . ''

		The other Pelicans are Lady Argent and Mrs. Severing .

		But Lady Argent is not a pretender like the others ; she has not enough intellect .

		She is a kind but feeble-minded woman , who does not know which weighs more , a ton of lead or a ton of feathers , and who has been an object of affectionate contempt to her son from , his tenth year onward .

		Mrs.
Sever	PERSON	- ing and `` her Morris '' are quite a different pair .

		The Severings , mother and son , understand each other only too well ; they see through each other with a blinding clearness , but there it stops .

		Neither of them has a ray of self-knowledge .

		Their dia - logues are perverse duels in which each tries vainly to drag out into the light the secret self of the other .

		Yet they cleave to each other as such people alone can cleave , and on rare and fleeting occasions , they enjoy a sense of perfect companionship `` when their respective mental tableaux vivants of one another happen to coincide . ''

		The author 's attitude toward her play-acting characters varies from cool sympathy to warm dis - like .

		She handles Zella with some tolerance but she finishes off
Miss Vivian	PERSON	, Director of the Mid - land Supply Depot , with a complete and perfect vengeance .

		As for sentimentalists like Aunt
Marianne	PERSON	and
Lesbia Willoughby	PERSON	, with their sheep - ish and would-be truthful consorts , they deserve no mercy from their author and , indeed , they get none .

		Likewise Cousin
Bertie	PERSON	and N'ina Severing are cor - dially detested , but they are by far the best of these satirical portraits .

		By comparison ,
Miss Vivian	PERSON	degenerates into an effigy .

		The Pelicans is superior , too , in the way in which the characters are psycho - logically proportioned to each other .

		Those who escape the lash convince us that they deserve to do so .

		In short , the newest novel indicates that the precocious Miss
Delafield	ORGANIZATION	is still developing .

		KATHARINE ANTHONY .

		240 THE DIAL
March 8	DATE	The Indian as Poet is just beginning to discover him .

		The pioneer 's harsh estimate has been modified to a sur - prising degree ; a good Indian , according to his students , is not so much a dead Indian as a singing one .

		Fragmentary reports have come to us and , in the work of
Natalie Curtis Burlin	PERSON	and
Mary Austin	PERSON	, a few rich and careful evaluations .

		But we have ' been offered singularly little by the protagonists of the red man that is either thorough or convincing .

		Much of this is due to the tremendous gap between the languages .

		Translation , at the best , is a difficult and ungrateful performance for both interlocutor and audience .

		But the translating of folk songs and aboriginal chants is an even more hazardous matter .

		So much that is idiomatic escapes or is distorted or is , most often , entirely misunderstood .

		A word out of place , even when it is apprehended , may need a chapter of explanations ; an uncertain phrase may mean nothing to anyone but the singer and his tribe who carry its connotations with them .

		I recall with fresh appreciation the various versions one small sentence went through before it attained intelligibility .

		In an Indian song -LRB- Ojibwa , accord - ing to
Robert Frost	PERSON	, from whom I have the story -RRB- a certain phrase was repeated several times .

		Its crudeness puzzled the translator who finally ren - dered it : '' / wear bad shoes '' This meant nothing in the context , so the phrase was changed to : `` My shoes hurt me . ''

		Still dissatisfied , the adapter showed it to an old Indian , who smiled and said nothing .

		After a while the venerable
Redman	PERSON	explained that the song was an ancient gambling tune , that the game was played with moccasins and a stone or small nut our shell game was possibly a variation of it and that the queer phrase , literally and figuratively , was : '' / use wicked shoes '' the line being a taunting challenge , uttered very much in the spirit of the side show come-on : '' Watch the little pea .

		Now you see it ; now you do n't ! ''

		This incident takes on a particular significance after one has read the greater part of the latest con - tribution to our indigenous literature , an anthology of songs and chants from the Indians of
North America	LOCATION	-LRB- The Path on the
Rainbow Boni & Liv	ORGANIZATION	- eright ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- .

		One suspects the editor ,
George W. Cronyn	PERSON	, of fathering more than a few hybrid if not actually dubious offspring .

		It is hard to say how much of the book should be credited to Mr.
Cronyn	PERSON	, his share of the task is concealed to the point of mystery .

		The front matter , purporting to be a translation of a song that never existed , is by
Carl Sandburg	PERSON	; the illuminating introduction is by
Mary Austin	PERSON	; the graceful essay by way of epilogue is the work of
Constance Lindsay Skinner	PERSON	.

		If Mr.
Cronyn	PERSON	is a genuine student of Indian folklore , he is to be blamed for not having made the volume more communicative and less cryptic ; many of these songs cry aloud for nothing so much as footnotes .

		Nor is one assisted materially by the arbitrary arrangement of words and a pretentious typography that is foreign to our native though it may be native to
Ezra Pound	PERSON	, '' H. D. , '' and
Richard Adington	PERSON	.

		For example : SONG OF THE TREES The wind only I am afraid of .

		Or this , redolent of Others and the
Kreymborg	PERSON	-
Johns	PERSON	' naivete : MAPLE SUGAR Maple sugar is the only thing That satisfies me .

		Or this equally inspired bit : HE Is GONE I might grieve I am sad that he has gone my lover .

		There are surprisingly many of such odd-shaped pieces of sentimentality .

		The number of them proves that , robbed of the imagiste set-up , the harsh aborigine can commit poetry as trite and banal as many an overcivilized paleface .

		The relationship does not end with the mere elimination of capitals and the indentation of a few lines .

		Miss
Austin	LOCATION	almost succeeds in disposing of par .

		of our objection .

		In her introduction she writes : That there is such a relationship any one at all familiar with current verse of the past three or four years must immediately conclude on turning over a few pages .

		He will be struck at once with the extraordinary likeness be - tween much of this native product and the recent work of the Imagists , vers librists , and other literary fashionables .

		He may , indeed , congratulate himself on the confirmation of his secret suspicion that Imagism is a very primitive form ; he may , if he happens to be of the Imagist 's party , suffer a check in the discovery that the first free move - ment of poetic originality in
America	LOCATION	finds us just about where the last Medicine Man left off .

		But what else could he have expected ?

		It would be unfair of me to give the impression that the book is made up of alternate portions of preciosity and platitudes .

		Some of the songs , especially those of the
Southwest	ORGANIZATION	, are full of vitality and several such as The Child Is Introduced to
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 241 the Cosmos at Birth , and the rituals are impressive even without the music , the rude chant which gives them most of their racial color .

		Of the translators ,
Natalie Curtis Burlin	PERSON	seems to retain more of the sharp flavor than the others ; of the interpreters , the two most successful are
Alice Corbin Henderson	PERSON	and
Frank Gordon	PERSON	.

		With work as good as theirs to live up to , it is an added disappointment to come across jingles like
Pauline Johnson	PERSON	's The Song My Paddle Sings , which is neither original nor aborig - inal , and rhymed sweetmeats as time-dusty as : It is dark on the
Lost Lagoon	LOCATION	, And gone are the depths of haunting blue , The grouping gulls , and the old canoe , The singing firs , and the dusk and you ; And gone is the golden moon .

		As an ethnic document this anthology is of indubitable value ; as a contribution to creative Americana it may grow to have importance .

		But as a collection for the mere man of letters it is a rather forbidding pile a crude and top-heavy mon - ument with a few lovely and even lively decorations .


Louis UNTERMEYER	PERSON	.

		Postprogramism and Reconstruction HEN CONCERT PROGRAMS distract with
Orn	PERSON	- stein ,
Schoenberg	PERSON	,
Scriabine	LOCATION	,
Strawinsky	LOCATION	, or
Ravel	ORGANIZATION	, and neglect the restrained and penetrative utterance of men like d'Indy and
Elgar	ORGANIZATION	, it is a consolation to read a lucid attack upon the sensationalism of the postprogramists , as we might term those who have carried to an extreme the alliance of music and ex - traneous matters .

		Such an attack forms the basis of the latest group of essays by
Daniel Gregory Ma	PERSON	- son Contemporary Composers -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 2	MONEY	-RRB- .

		To those who know from deeply emotional experi - ences that `` abstract '' music is a far greater thing than mathematical note-spinning , the book will be welcome indeed ; for seldom has contemporary music been so ably analyzed from the position of the purist .

		With characteristic clarity of expression and thought , Mr.
Mason	PERSON	dissects the tendencies of to - day 's music , and thus completes his brilliant cycle of essays on the history of modern music Beet - hoven and his Forerunners , The Romantic Com - posers , From Grieg to
Brahms	PERSON	, and
Contemporary Composers	ORGANIZATION	.

		Musicians who are on everyone 's lips today the programists , the impressionists , the sensationalists are criticized as looking away from that inner emo - tion `` to which alone , '' as
Wagner	PERSON	said , `` can music give a voice , and music only . ''

		With the exception of
Strauss	PERSON	and Debussy , they receive but passing mention in this volume .

		These two are regarded as showing frequently the same decadent elements , mixed , however , with certain merits that make their consideration imperative .

		The discussion of their characteristics for instance , the gradually increas - ing interest of
Strauss	PERSON	in externals at the expense of inner emotion will be found to be quite valuable .

		Those who receive the author 's real deference , how - ever , are d'Indy and Elgar despite the latter 's fre - quent vulgarity and it is by men of their character that he expects the best traditions of music to be carried forward in the face of shallowness and dis - play .

		To the casual music listener such a realign - ment of names and rank will be novel , though hardly surprising if he will reflect that the casual listeners of their day placed
Spohr	PERSON	above
Beethoven	LOCATION	and
Meyerbeer	ORGANIZATION	above
Wagner	PERSON	.

		In so far as this realignment of contemporary composers is based on the creed of music for its own sake , it is too sound to be seriously questioned ; but in part , one must ad - mit , it appears to rest on individual taste .

		Nothing could be easier than to recognize the book as authoritative and to settle back comfortably into acceptance of its persuasive views .

		They form a consistent , individual , well thought out philosophy of music .

		They are the conclusions of one appar - ently sure of himself , one whose opinions tend to crystallize .

		But can one man 's philosophy of music be accepted by another ?

		Are we dealing altogether with valid , permanent judgments , or is a man 's ar - tistic perception mostly the composite of his experi - ences meeting another 's perception , not because of absolute values but because of inheritances and ex - periences common to both ?

		Biological and philo - sophical questions arise but , being mostly unan - swered , they must be passed over with the one com - ment that , if the values to which we would attach permanence are an illusion , like that of free will , we face the same necessity of recognizing the mechanical nature of our reactions and of acting as if we did not .

		For practical purposes , certain standards may be taken to be absolute .

		Debussy 's music , for in - stance , does carefully avoid sweeping melodic line .

		That is a question of fact .

		Similarly , one can prac - tically regard as a fact a conclusion of the final essay that ragtime does not `` express ''
America	LOCATION	.

		The plausibility of Mr.
Mason	PERSON	's book is enhanced because he is so inevitably right in regard to these questions of fact .

		And it is only a step further for him to think , perhaps , that if he can be authoritative here , 242 THE DIAL
March 8	DATE	he can also trust his impressions in regard to more subtle matters , such as the appeal of a particular passage of music , or the beneficial or evil results of certain musical tendencies .

		In this connection it is interesting to note that in presenting his impressions in so positive a manner , Mr.
Mason	PERSON	is following out his creed of individual - ism .

		Of the musician he says : `` He must love his cause so singly that he will cleave to it , and forsake all else ... He must take sides .

		He must be , not a philosopher , but a partisan .

		He must have good hearty enthusiasms , and good hearty prej - udices .

		Only so can he be an individual . ''

		Such a statement would be disquieting enough if it were not for the obvious refutation that philosophers have ever been individuals .

		We need not be provincial to be ourselves , nor need we reject our deepest and most unique feelings to give our neighbor his due .

		Occasionally readers of a magazine of literary criticism need to be reminded of the subjectivity of artistic perception .

		If a reflective person is honest with himself , he will know that only an occasional movement or passage of music of even the greatest masters is really of a nature to permit his thorough appreciation of it .

		On different occasions even the same passage will affect him in an entirely new way .

		Moreover , he will catch himself being thrilled by a given effect because it has pleasurable associations , because in some indefinable way his ear has been prepared to appreciate it , or because it appears strikingly original to him .

		If sufficiently introspec - tive , he may be able to see the mechanism of his ap - preciation at work , and from that day he will never trust his personal opinion sufficiently to declare un - reservedly that this is a great work or that the other has no permanent value .

		And thus I prefer to think of the major portion of musical criticism in this and previous books of Mr.
Mason	PERSON	's as being the impres - sions of a broadly interested , clear-thinking , and wholesome musical critic , with whom I personally happen to agree in regard to a vast number of musi - cal matters .

		And if another man should find
Elgar	ORGANIZATION	's First Symphony dry , or fail to find in it the interpre - tation of the same emotions that are described some - what too fully in the present volume , I should not be so certain as Mr.
Mason	PERSON	that his musical appre - ciation is at fault .

		When the author is merely offering `` suggestions and hints '' as to the future of music , he can be read with more confidence .

		Pointing out at length how music , having passed gradually from the hands of the nobility to those of the people , has suffered from the loss of its homogeneous audience and from the fatigue-results of capitalism and industrial servitude , the author suggests that possibly an era of cooperation and communism may rescue it from the sensational and revivify it .

		The essay in question was written when after-the-war conditions did not seem of such immediate importance ; but it forms an interesting departure for reconstruction speculations .

		The attitude that the arts can come along in the wake of more material reconstruction is not less dangerous than the related one that the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	can be patched up after the Peace Confer - ence .

		There would be no great value in making the world safe for a democracy stripped of the finer fea - tures of the arts .

		If no concerted action to improve directly the status of music is possible at present , we must at least realize that in forming our opinions as to social changes we should know if possible what these changes may mean to music .

		If social justice is to give music a better opportunity , as Mr.
Mason	PERSON	believes , then we can work toward it with added zest .

		What is looked for is `` first , the gradual refining , deepening , and vitalizing of the taste of the general public under the influence of increasing leisure , health , self-respect , and education ; second , the cut - ting off of extravagance , luxury , and faddism in the wealthier classes by a wholesome pressure of en - forced economy ; third , increasing solidarity of feel - ing in the whole social fabric through such a mutual rapprochement , giving the indispensable emotional basis for vital art . ''

		Such a picture is an additional incentive to raise our aims toward cooperation and communism as the real expression of the democracy for which we have waged war .

		In doing so we must face the problem with our eyes open .

		Unless the greatest vigilance is exercised , the world will slip back into the same rut of capitalism and industrial servitude , with conditions more intolerable than ever before .

		Not only social justice but the future of the arts calls for our efforts .

		And pending the slow evolution of such a social organization as the author hopes will ^ revivify music , the advice to the American composer in the last essay is of singular value .

		He must realize that while society withholds proper payment for his best creative work , especially in this country , it freely offers him a livelihood if he will only teach , perform , or do anything but create new music .

		However , he must also `` realize that music , like so - ciety , has reached its present state only through the struggles , against immense odds , of its martyrs and its heroes .

		He must be ready to sacrifice much and to feel that in the possession of a lifelong enthu - siasm he has the best gift that life has to offer .

		ROLLO BRITTEN .

		1919 THE DIAL 243 A New American Statesman Series JLN THE TWO VOLUMES ,
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	, by
David Saville Muzzey	PERSON	, and
Jefferson Davis	PERSON	, by
Armistead C. Gordon	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
$ 1.50	MONEY	each -RRB- , Scribner 's have announced a series of biographies of American Statesmen to supplement or replace those already in existence .

		There are two conditions of the success of this enterprise an editor who understands the status of historical writing in the
United States	LOCATION	, and cooperating scholars who both know what has been the actual development in this country and have the gifts to apply their knowledge to the subjects .

		These volumes illustrate the editorial point of view that has been adopted , a liberal writer for a liberal subject , a conservative for a conservative subject .

		On this principle , the story of
Jefferson by Professor Muzzey	ORGANIZATION	reaches a degree of success and fairness hitherto unattained .

		We have had biographies of
Jefferson	LOCATION	galore , but none that ap - proaches
Thayer	PERSON	's
Life of Cavour	ORGANIZATION	which by the way might be taken as a model in visualizing the great author of the Declaration of Independence .

		Nearly all men who have written of
Jefferson	PERSON	make out that he received his ideals and philosophy from the French .

		Muzzey shows how absurd is this theory , for it could never have been anything more than a theory invented by men who did not know the facts .

		Another thing Muzzey makes clearer than others have done is the great work of
Jeffer	PERSON	- son in literally overturning the whole
Virginia	LOCATION	civilization during the early years of the Revolu - tion '' while the iron was hot . ''

		What he does not quite grasp is the fact that
Virginia	LOCATION	I mean vot - ing
Virginia	LOCATION	never , after
1781	DATE	, admired ' her great - est citizen .

		That
Jefferson	PERSON	received the support of
Virginia	LOCATION	for the Presidency does - not prove any - thing , for it was a case of Jefferson against
John Adams	PERSON	or some other alien for aliens good Vir - ginians always regarded
New England	LOCATION	men .

		So articulate Virginians took
Jefferson	PERSON	in preference to a '' foreigner . ''

		The test of their loyalty to him came in the constant pressure from
Monticello	LOCATION	to have a new and mlore democratic constitution for the great old state .

		Jefferson was a man of some as - tuteness , but he labored forty years for a democratic constitution and to no avail .


Virginia	LOCATION	would have none of it .

		This is not to say that the author of our new
Life of Jefferson	ORGANIZATION	has not done a good job .

		He has ; only he missed the common American habit of compro - mising state and national affairs in the setting up of presidential candidates .


Virginia	LOCATION	would , for ex - ample , gladly have a Democrat for President but never think of one for Governor .

		It has been so with other leaders .


Wilson	PERSON	has never , I believe , carried a majority of the votes of
New Jersey	LOCATION	on the merits of his democratic program .

		He could hardly carry a single American state today if he really proposed to make a state democratic .

		Yet he could probably carry the country .

		This is writing about a book and not giving its contents .

		But the spirit of the book is given .

		Muzzey 's short volume puts
Jefferson	PERSON	in his proper position .

		It does not mistake his purpose at any time .

		It was not States Rights that
Jefferson	PERSON	ad - vocated in the great war with Federalism , but the cause of democracy which
Jefferson	ORGANIZATION	thought he could forward by using the States .

		He had no idea of dissolving the
Federal Union	ORGANIZATION	in his
Kentucky	LOCATION	resolutions and none knew this better than contem - poraries ; but they chose to attack him on that ground rather than on democratic grounds .

		The pity of this biography is that it is not longer and more elaborate .

		The greatest of American demo - crats before Lincoln deserves it .

		Mr.
Armistead Gordon	PERSON	's
Life of Jefferson Davis	ORGANIZATION	is written on the assumption that the author of the biography should sympathize with the subject .

		That is , Mr.
Gordon	PERSON	is supposed by the editor of the series to sympathize with secession as a rightful measure of sectional defense or to approve of what are some - times called conservative principles in society .

		The biography is written by one who can , therefore , see the task from the point of view of
Davis	PERSON	.

		With that there can be no quarrel certainly not if the author is a miaster of his art and is a philosopher who knows history in long periods , rather than in decade instalments .

		The book fulfills the expectations of the editor .

		It will satisfy those who look upon history through Southern spectacles ; it will please gentlefolk , North and South , who still feel the dire need of cheap household servants .

		Nor does it fall short of high historical standards .

		I have detected no important error in all its pages .

		It reads well , moreover , and the footnotes give every evidence of care and honesty in its composition .

		No previous worker in the field has been slighted , no matter how widely the diver - gence of viewpoint .

		That is a good deal .

		Not many writers of history in this country have been able to rise to similar heights of just dealing .

		Yet , if the reviewer mistake not , the story of
Jefferson Davis	PERSON	remains to be written .


Davis	PERSON	was a rather noble nature , a sincere aristocrat , a man who never believed in the principles that pe - 244 THE DIAL
March 8	DATE	culiarly mark American history .

		His philosophy was that of
Nietzsche	LOCATION	, but without the brutalism of the German ; it was that of
Bismarck	PERSON	without the cold - blooded cynicism of the great Prussian ;
Davis	PERSON	be - lieved that the minority , the educated , '' the rich and the good , '' as Fisher Ames once put it , should govern .

		There are classes in all society , the sim - ple field laborer , the more sophisticated artisan and small farmer group , and the highly intelligent rul - ing and employing class .

		To this latter belonged , from his point of view , the responsibility of gov - erning , not of exploiting , all the rest .

		This may seem an exaggeration .

		Yet I think the President of the Confederacy did not exploit his slaves , cer - tainly he did not feel that intense desire of ex - ploitation which marks the conduct of so many leaders of industry today .

		Davis thought a slave should have all he could earn ; but he could only earn a comfortable living for himself and family .

		Davis would have made of all
America	LOCATION	a fine old feudal state in which every man should have his place and be made physically as comfortable as the state of things would allow .

		In the light of this philosophy Mr.
Gordon	PERSON	's book falls short of its high promise otherwise .

		It gives the facts of a romantic and reactionary period and personal career ; but it does not arrange those facts in such a way that the reader understands what
Davis	PERSON	and his devoted coworkers intended to do .

		That we must lament , for the story is such a dra - matic one , and the author would have made such a charming and soul moving narrative if he had grasped that larger opportunity .

		All the discus - sions of constitutional guarantees and the rights of property , clearly and accurately set forth as they are , fail to grip the reader unless it is made plain what men wanted to do .

		There can be no doubt , for ex - ample , that the
Federal Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	had law and constitution on its side in the Dred Scott dictum .

		But the reader can not understand why Lincoln was not satisfied with it if he confines himself to Gor - don 's pages .

		One needs to know the meaning of law and constitution .

		Mr.
Gordon	PERSON	wonders why the North refused to abide by the decision of the court which its leaders had so long praised as the rightful arbiter in great controversies .

		It is plain enough .

		The body of Northern men , stirred perhaps by some designing leaders , had gone past that older view .

		They were returning to the ideals of the Declaration of Independence , of equality among men .

		And to such men law and constitution do not settle things .

		Davis knew why Lin - coln was not satisfied .

		He knew and feared the deep feeling of common men everywhere ; it boded ill for any system of government in which gentle - folk and trained minds held all the places of power .

		Davis also knew what the author does not grasp , why
Douglas	PERSON	broke with
Buchanan	PERSON	in
December 1857	DATE	.

		The fact that
Douglas	PERSON	who had no supreme faith in democracy , as had Lincoln , could not abide the decision of
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	portended dis - aster to
Davis	PERSON	.

		It showed that not only the anti- slavery men of the North were against the phil - osophy of
Davis	PERSON	but that moderate men , who cared little about slavery in any form , could not defend it .

		Ignoring this crucial test of
1857	DATE	, Mr.
Gordon	PERSON	loses the best opportunity of his subject to set forth the merits of the quarrel that was about to rend the country into warring sections .

		But I must not leave the impression that the book is not a good one .

		It only falls into that class of books measured by the standards of the older series of biographies .

		It is as good as any , perhaps bet - ter than any we have of the great Confederate leader .

		The disappointment consists in the failure of the author to give us a better story of a supremely tragic career .


WILLIAM E. DODD	PERSON	.


London	LOCATION	,
February 4	DATE	I T is DIFFICULT to believe that little more than eight months have passed since I arrived -LRB- involun - tarily -RRB- in
England	LOCATION	.

		Then we were in the midst of the most critical period of the war , the end of which seemed very far off .

		Now the war is practically although not formally over .

		You can hardly in
America	LOCATION	fully understand what that means to one who experienced nearly four years of war in
France	LOCATION	.

		When I left
Paris	LOCATION	in
May	DATE	, it was deserted by at least one third of its population ; the city was wrapped in gloom , material and moral .

		Both be - fore `` and after I left , the German shells were fall - ing daily on
Paris	LOCATION	.

		I shall never forget the im - pression that was made on me , when I arrived in
London	LOCATION	, by the complete contrast between the as - pects of the two cities .


London	LOCATION	was crowded , more crowded than I had ever seen it , and seemed gayer than in normal times .

		Theaters and restaurants were thronged , and it was difficult to find a room in a hotel .

		The spirits of Londoners seemed not at all affected by the anxious military situation , partly because they were farther off , partly no doubt because they are less liable to sudden changes of temper than the Parisians , who alternated between
1919	DATE
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	245 the extreme of optimism and the extreme of pessi - mism .

		There had been a bad air raid on
London	LOCATION	the last of the war during the very night on which I crossed the Channel .

		It left no trace on the spirits of the population .

		Certainly one must respect the steadiness of the English character , whichTis particularly conspicuous at this moment .

		There has been much less of the intoxication of victory here than in the other Allied countries , and now there is none at all .

		But in the first months of my arrival
London	LOCATION	seemed to me too indifferent to the tragedy of the war .

		To one coming from a country where indifference was im - possible there was something indecent in the evi - dent pleasure-seeking , in the vast masses of people thoroughly enjoying themselves while just across the Channel was the Great Atrocity .

		Now all that hap - pily belongs to the past and gayety is no longer in - congruous .

		I shall never forget the sensation of realizing , when the guns on the morning of No - vember 1 1 announced the Armistice , that for the first time for more than four years nobody was being killed on the devastated plains of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The first thought of many people no doubt turned to victory ; mine was entirely preoccupied by the cessation of the slaughter .

		I quite understand the intense re - lief of the people even of defeated
Germany	LOCATION	.

		The English people as a whole , as I have said , has not been intoxicated by victory .

		Of course during the Armistice week
London	LOCATION	went more or less mad and there was not a little intoxication in the literal sense of the term .

		But there is little sign of any desire to abuse the victory , of any lust of conquest .

		There is no popular demand for annexations or un - conscionable terms of peace .

		The peace aims of the English people are the same as their war aims the suppression of militarism and the abolition of war .

		They really and sincerely went to war for those objects , and their present attitude shows that they are a fundamentally pacific people .

		No doubt part of the press has had a different attitude .

		Dur - ing the general election the two `` stunts '' of `` hang the Kaiser '' and `` make the Germans pay '' were worked for all they were worth .

		They seem to have appealed to the newly enfranchised women , for whose special benefit they were probably started .

		But they are now almost forgotten and interest no - body .

		As to the latter , sensible people realize that it is materially impossible to make the Germans pay the whole cost of the war and that there are so many other prior claims that this country is unlikely ever to get a penny .

		The fate of the German colo - nies , in which some of the British Dominions are keenly interested , interests hardly anybody in this country ; it is purely a journalistic stunt .

		The general public wants three things : immediate demobilization , the entire abolition of conscription , and measures to prevent war in the future .

		In re - gard to demobilization , it hardly takes account of the time that it must necessarily take to demobilize millions of men .

		But the country is determined that they shall be demobilized as soon as possible and that , above all , no policy shall be adopted which might involve the keeping of the soldiers under arms .

		That is the reason why the suggestion of continued military operations in
Russia	LOCATION	provoked immediate indignation .

		Mr.
Lloyd George	PERSON	knows how to feel the pulse of popular opinion .

		No doubt his own remarkable intelligence led him to oppose war against the Russian Revolution , but he also knew that the country would not follow him in any other policy .

		Never was a decision received with greater and more universal satisfaction in
England	LOCATION	than the adoption by the
Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	of President Wil - son 's proposal in regard to
Russia	LOCATION	, which embodied the policy proposed at the beginning of this year by Mr.
Lloyd George	PERSON	and then rejected by
M. Clemenceau	PERSON	and 'M .

		Pichon .

		There is also intense satisfaction here at the evidently close cooperation of the British and American delegates at the
Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	and Mr.
Lloyd George	PERSON	are standing together for a sincere application of the principles for which all the Allies professed to be fighting .

		If any kind of genuine League of Na - tions comes out of the
Conference	ORGANIZATION	, it will be this cooperation that we have to thank for it .

		It has been only too clear that there are many in
France	LOCATION	for whom the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	means a new Holy Alliance to put down `` Bolshevism , '' as the old
Holy Alliance	ORGANIZATION	tried to put down the French Revolution , and to make the world safe for capitalism .

		It may be said with safety that the British working classes would never tolerate such a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	as that .

		As to the state of feeling in
France	LOCATION	, I have no direct information .

		I can only form impressions from the French press and the reports of friends .

		It would be a mistake to assume that the great Parisian papers necessarily represent French public opinion ; they did not before the war , they have done so still less during the war , and there is no reason to believe that they are more representative now .

		French sol - diers are certainly no more disposed to go on fighting in
Russia	LOCATION	than are British soldiers , who have recently made their opinion on that matter very plain .

		But the press is controlled by the financial interests , whose power is greater in
France	LOCATION	than in any other European country .

		No crime , real or imaginary , of the Bolsheviks is so great , in the eyes of the great French banks and financiers , as their repudiation 246 THE DIAL
March 8	DATE	of the national debt .

		That is the secret of the de - mand of the French press for war against the Rus - sian Revolution and of its indignation at the de - cision of the
Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	, which found its most extreme expression in the remark of `` Pertinax '' -LRB- M. Giraud -RRB- in the Echo de
Paris	LOCATION	of
January 23	DATE	that `` Ideology , ignorance and electoral policy are the guests of the Quai d'Orsay . ''

		`` Electoral policy '' means respect for public opinion .

		Difficult as it is to ascertain what the mass of the French people the peasants and the proletariat are thinking , there can be no doubt that the wine of victory has gone to the head of a considerable num - ber in
France	LOCATION	.

		Indeed the greater part of the bourgeoisie , afany rate , seems to have lost its head .


Paris	LOCATION	as usual is particularly affected .

		Radical dep - uties who only a few months ago denounced the claims to the
Left Bank of the Rhine	ORGANIZATION	now denounce those that still object to them .

		The very men who in
June 1917	DATE	forced
M. Ribot	PERSON	to repudiate the agreement of
February 1917	DATE	with the Government of the Czar , now demand all that that agreement tried to secure to
France	LOCATION	.

		It is impossible to deny it : victory has revived the old militarist and Chauvinist spirit of
France	LOCATION	which , it must be re - membered , was dominant throughout the
nineteenth century	DATE	, except during the reign of
Louis Philippe	PERSON	, and was only reduced to impotence by the victory of the Dreyfusards at the end of the century .

		All Frenchmen over forty were brought up under the in - fluence of that spirit ; many of them emancipated themselves from it but , as is now evident , the eman - cipation was not in all cases complete , and the old spirit has once more entered into many that had thrown it off .

		Clearly the war was in its inception a purely defensive war so far as
France	LOCATION	was con - cerned , but before it had lasted long there was an influential party which tried to convert it into a war of Revanche .

		They failed to carry with them the bulk of the French people , but they are carrying many more with them in trying to make the vic - tory a victory of Revanche .

		So far as vocal opinion goes , the great difference that I see between French and English opinion is that the former seems to be chiefly concerned with purely national interests and ambitions , whereas the latter is more concerned about the general interest of the world .

		There is no tenderness for the Germans in
England	LOCATION	, but a certain good sense tells us that war will never be got rid of if we allow this victory to be abused as all victories have been in the past and if the peace terms are such as to leave behind '' them another Revanche .

		A genuine
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	will be a much more effective protection to
France	LOCATION	and all other countries than territorial guarantees and strategic frontiers .


Germany	LOCATION	insisted on a strategic frontier in
1871	DATE	and the results are before us .

		Yet there are actually influential persons and news - papers in
France	LOCATION	that want to repeat the conduct of
Germany	LOCATION	now .

		The only hope of the world is in entirely new methods .

		I think that the great ma - jority of the English people recognize that fact ; hence their enthusiasm for President
Wilson	PERSON	and their satisfaction at Mr.
Lloyd George	PERSON	's coopera - tion with him .

		Mr.
Lloyd George	PERSON	has strengthened his position by his attitude during the Peace Con - gress and the attacks on him of the Echo de
Paris	LOCATION	and some other
French Nationalist	ORGANIZATION	papers will strengthen it still more .

		Nevertheless there is great unrest in
England	LOCATION	.

		At the moment of writing there are general strikes at
Glasgow	LOCATION	and
Belfast	LOCATION	, strikes on the
London	LOCATION	'' Tubes '' railways which are entirely stopped , local and sectional strikes in many other places .

		General strikes of the railway men and the engineers are threatened , as is an electrician 's strike in
London	LOCATION	.

		The immediate and ostensible cause of the strikes is the demand for a forty-hour week , but they are symptoms of profound discontent in the working class and they have in many cases notably at Glas - gow a definitely revolutionary character .

		The Bel - fast strike has brought about an extraordinary situa - tion in
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		Labor seems about to bridge the gulf between
North and South	ORGANIZATION	.

		Racial and reli - gious differences are yielding to common economic interests and Sir
Edward Carson	PERSON	's reign in
Ulster	LOCATION	is threatened .

		The
Belfast	LOCATION	strikers have made over - tures to their fellow workmen in
Dublin	LOCATION	and an alli - ance between
Sinn Fein and Labor	ORGANIZATION	between the political and industrial rebels seems probable at the moment of writing .

		The Sinn Feiners have been quiet since the general election because the hope was held out to them that their interned members , thirty of whom have been returned to
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, would be released .

		The
Government	ORGANIZATION	has now decided not to release them and the situation is naturally much worse than it would have been if the hope had never been held out .

		The
Sinn Feiners	ORGANIZATION	have now determined to act and we may see the
North and South of Ireland	LOCATION	united in a general revolutionary strike against the
English Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		Should this come about , it will be a momentous event in Irish history .

		In any case the old modified Home Rule is dead and
Ireland	LOCATION	will now never accept less than an autonomy such as is enjoyed by the self - governing Dominions of the British Empire .

		Never has revolutionary feeling been so strong or so wide - spread in this country since the Chartist movement .

		The
Trade Union	ORGANIZATION	leaders and officials have lost con - trol of the rank and file and the
Trade Union	ORGANIZATION	or - igig THE DIAL 247 ganizations are in process of transformation .

		Their control seems about to pass formally into the hands of the shop stewards , who already exercise that con - trol in fact .

		Those who believed that the prolongation of the war would lead to revolution everywhere I was one of them already seem on the way to be justified .

		Ex - isting society has been shaken to its very founda - tions and it is doubtful whether it can escape de - struction .

		The anxious question for the world is whether there will be forthcoming men capable of constructing a new society to take its place or whether we are on the verge of a period of mere anarchy .

		Certainly the present situation justifies
Lord Lansdowne	LOCATION	and the few others who saw the only hope of saving existing society in an early peace by negotiation .

		The Socialists that supported Lord
Lansdowne	PERSON	did so for other reasons because they believed , rightly or wrongly , that nothing justified the continued massacre of the youth of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Had they thought only of the interest of Socialism , they would certainly have advocated war to the bitter end to the end that has actually been reached , the break-up of the capitalist system over the greater part of the continent of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Revo - lution began , as was inevitable , with the conquered peoples .

		It would be rash indeed to assume that it will stop with them .

		The present attitude of English workmen for - bids any such assumption .

		Although those that were not at the front have never been so well off as they were during the war for wages rose in an even greater proportion than prices it is now evi - dent that its prolongation exasperated them .

		Now that the tension is removed their real feeling can show itself .

		Moreover the days of fictitious pros - perity are numbered .

		Demobilization is throwing millions of men into the labor market , the cessation of war manufacture is causing the displacement of industry such as has never before been known , we are left with a huge war debt which means , if it is to be paid in full , a heavy tax on the labor of genera - tions to come .

		The workmen see that , unless there is a drastic change in economic conditions , they can - not hope to be even as well off as they were before the war .

		The women are even more discontented than the men .

		During the war they have for the first time had economic independence .

		Women have poured into business , trade , and industry , and have earned wages such as they had never dreamed of .

		They are not at all disposed to return to the old conditions .

		Married women who have been earning their own money and spending it as they pleased will not again be content to be the slaves of husbands who dole out to them weekly a small portion of their wages .

		The war has completely revolutionized the position of women and the rela - tions of the sexes in every class .

		That is a large subject to which I hope to return in a future letter .

		Meanwhile it is enough to note that the women are not at all willing to surrender their places to men and return to domesticity .

		The influence of the Russian Revolution , which was at first enormous but was arrested by the with - drawal of
Russia	LOCATION	from the war , has revived and been intensified by the revolutions in
Central Eu	ORGANIZATION	- rope .

		There is in the working class a profound distrust of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	and politicians , and an in - creasing tendency to disbelieve in the efficacy of parliamentary methods .

		The advocates of '' direct action '' `` are increasing in number daily .

		There have been striking examples of its efficacy in the suc - cessful resistance of Ulster to Home Rule for Ire - land , the refusal of Mr.
Havelock Wilson	PERSON	to allow Internationalists to cross the Channel , and such suc - cesses as that of the police strike in
London	LOCATION	and the retaliation of the electricians against the manager of the
Albert Hall	PERSON	when he refused it for a labor meet - ing until his light was cut off , when he yielded at once .

		The Conservative press , with fatuous blindness , applauded Sir
Edward Carson	PERSON	and Mr.
Havelock Wilson	PERSON	, forgetting that others could play at their game .

		Moreover , the result of the general election has strengthened the hands of the advocates of '' direct action . ''

		Only half the electors took the trouble to vote , and an illogical electoral system has resulted in a
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	which does not properly represent the voters .

		The poll of
the Labor Party	ORGANIZATION	entitled it to twice as .

		many members as it has obtained , the Opposition Liberals are even more under-represented , and the Unionist party has a clear majority of the
House	ORGANIZATION	, whereas the voting showed that it is in a minority in the country .

		Were the representation of the various parties in the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	even approximately pro- portionate to their respective polls , the ministerial Coalition would have a moderate majority instead of an overwhelming one and that majority would depend on the Liberal members of the
Coalition	ORGANIZATION	, whereas at the present moment the Unionists alone have a majority over all the other parties put together .

		Parliament is in consequence more discredited than ever and it has even been proposed that the Labor members should refuse , like the
Sinn Feiners	PERSON	, to take part in its proceedings .

		The proposal has not been adopted , but it is significant that it should even have been made .

		Nobody supposes that the present Parliament can last very long .

		The soldiers , 248 THE DIAL
March 8	DATE	very few of whom were able to vote , will demand another general election after the demobilization is completed .

		Mr.
Lloyd George	PERSON	has threatened a , dissolution if he is thwarted in his policy .

		That he recognizes the necessity of a thoroughly democratic policy is certain and there can be no doubt as to his skill and intelligence .

		But it is unlikely that he will be able to regain the confidence of the work - men as a body , nor has he a sufficiently profound grasp of the factors in the situation .

		He is extraor - dinarily skilful in dealing with the difficulty of the moment , but he sometimes does so in such a way as to create further difficulties in the future .

		Just before the poll of the general election , he suddenly made a violent attack on the
Labor Party	ORGANIZATION	and ac - cused it of being led by '' Bolsheviks . ''

		That will not be forgotten in a hurry .

		The soldiers are quite as discontented as the men engaged in industry during the war .

		There were recently several manifestations of their discontent , which did not enforce discipline .

		The causes were dissatisfaction at the system of demobilization and unwillingness to take part in any expedition to Rus - sia or anywhere else .

		The Government was obliged to declare officially that no more troops would be sent to
Russia	LOCATION	.

		The announcement that 900,000 men are to be retained under the colors for another year to form an army of occupation in the territories of our late enemies will not improve feeling in the army or the country .

		It means a prolongation of conscription .

		Both the army and the country will demand peace terms which do not make any army of occupation necessary and , if they do not get them , there may be trouble .

		I am disposed to think that the present strikes will not last long ; by the time that this article ap - pears in print it will be known whether I am right .

		But their end will not mean the end of the indust - trial unrest .

		Rather is it likely to extend .

		As de - mobilization proceeds the economic conditions will become more and more difficult and the causes of discontent will increase rather than diminish .

		We are entering on a period of strikes and industrial troubles such as
England	LOCATION	has not known since the days of Chartism .

		What its issue will be no man knoweth .

CLARENCE BRITTEN	PERSON	In Charge of the Reconstruction Program ,
THORSTEIN VEBLEN HAROLD STEARNS HELEN MAROT	PERSON	.

		HE ROUTINE CAUSE FOR DEPORTATION CITED against agitators is that of advocating the overthrow of the American government by force .

		This is notably the case with the 60 odd
I. W. W.	PERSON	's and others awaiting the pleasure of the immigration au - thorities at
Ellis Island	LOCATION	.

		Of course that section of the amendment to the immigration act which makes advocacy of the overthrow of this government by force grounds for the deportation of an alien is justifiable , although we should like to point out that the definition of what constitutes advocacy of the overthrow of this government by force is so vague that the pleaders for that mild degree of sabotage which is known as '' striking on the job '' are con - sidered to come within the law 's provisions .

		But the amendment to the immigration act goes much further .

		It specifically states that advocacy of the overthrow by force of any government whatsoever shall be considered grounds for the deportation of any alien .

		Now to include this provision within the scope of the amendment is manifestly to make the law ridiculous or as is more plausibly the case to make it just an instrument of indiscriminate coercion .

		Consider some of its absurd implications . ''

		The Friends of Russian Freedom , '' who , before the war , included some of our most upright arid humanitarian leaders , would be liable to deportation under this act provided , of course , that they lacked American citizenship papers .

		A political refugee from
Siberia	LOCATION	who came to this country to preach the evils of Czarism and the necessity for a cleansing revolution in
Russia	LOCATION	would have been sent back to the Czar 's hangmen .

		Before our beneficent war for democracy had robbed us of our most elementary conceptions of political asylum and freedom of speech such a law could never have passed even - a
Senate Judiciary Committee	ORGANIZATION	.

		It would have been repugnant to those traditions of liberty which used to be dear to most Americans .

		We had always prided ourselves on the fact that our shores bounded a safe refuge for the persecuted of other lands .

		Certainly we can not do so any longer .

		Yet it is the demonstrable hypocrisy of the recent law which makes it a stench in the nostrils of all decent men .

		Suppose that something like the present Soviet Government in
Russia	LOCATION	should come to be officially recognized .

		Would the alien agitators from
Russia	LOCATION	now in this country advocating the overthrow of that
Government	ORGANIZATION	by force and part of that force our own soldiers be deported to
Russia	LOCATION	if they continued in the strain of their recent advertise - ments in our daily papers ?

		Another instance , who of us can not today arise in a public meeting and denounce the
British Government	ORGANIZATION	in
Ireland	LOCATION	to his heart 's content and end by advocating its overthrow by force ?

		it wonld be a violation of the law , but it would be a violation very unlikely to be brought to a Grand Jury 's attention unless , of course , we were a '' dangerous '' labor agitator .

		And even then the local District Attorney would be likely to be easy .

		Why ?

		Well , the Irish have a big vote in this country ; they dominate many political ma - chines ; they have the sympathy of a large and powerful section of American organized labor .

		In other words , so long as an agitator against a foreign government is respectable , so long as he has any political backing in this country , so long as he is not mixed up with any radical wing of the labor move - ment , he can agitate against a foreign government as vigorously as he pleases .

		It is only the weak and the unprotected who have to fear deportation .

		If , for example , the Hindus recently scheduled for deportation had an influence on American political life commensurate with the Irish , who of us would be so naive as to imagine that they would now be awaiting the pleasure of the immigration authori - ties ?

		We cite these pitiful cases last , for not only do they illustrate the manifest hypocrisy of the law but also how far we have wandered from our former proud estate of political asylum .

		We stand ready today to deport Hindus who advocate the overthrow of the British government in
India	LOCATION	by force in - deed , we have already actually deported some of them , blind or indifferent to the fact that such de - portation for a Hindu nationalist usually means execution by the British authorities .

		As long as any government , however corrupt or tyrannical or vicious , is formally recognized , refugees have not the right in the
United States	LOCATION	to advocate the over - throw by force of that government .

		We do not of course say , or even mean to imply , that the gov - ernment of
India	LOCATION	, under British rule , is either cor - rupt or tyrannical or vicious .

		But we do say that even ten years ago it would never have occurred to us to deny a Hindu refugee the right to say exactly that , if he thought it was true .

		2 5 THE DIAL
March 8	DATE	WE ARE RECEIVING FREQUENT REMINDERS OF the fact that the Russian Revolution is of the classic type established by
France	LOCATION	, not of the romantic or eccentric school current in the Western hemisphere .

		One of the notes of classic revolution is its propul - sion by energy derived from internal combustion .

		In
France	LOCATION	the States General was burned to heat the fires of the
Legislative Assembly	ORGANIZATION	, and that in turn was consumed to set in motion the Convention , which again was sacrificed to the
Committee of Public Safety	ORGANIZATION	.

		Vergniaud fell before
Danton	PERSON	, and t -RRB- anton before
Robespierre	LOCATION	, as
Lvoff	ORGANIZATION	fell before
Kerensky	PERSON	, and
Kerensky	ORGANIZATION	before
Lenin	PERSON	.

		But those who are curious enough to inquire into the physics of revolution are aware that this internal energy which becomes explosive is in the main generated under pressure from without .

		How far the French Revolution overshot its original mark because of the intervention of
Prussia	LOCATION	and
Austria	LOCATION	is a matter of history , and the accession of
England	LOCATION	to the Allies made certain the Reign of Terror .

		This is the great tragedy in the annals of revolution the way in which the good cause is maneuvered by skilful opposition into excess and self-destruction .

		Mr.
F. C. Howe	PERSON	has expressed the opinion that the modern world took a fatally wrong turn when
England	LOCATION	suppressed her early sympathy with the French Rev - olution , and , under the spell of
Burke	PERSON	's declamation , joined the ranks of the repressers .

		In this respect also it is easy to see the parallel between the situa - tion of
France	LOCATION	and that of
Russia	LOCATION	, between the Allies of
1794	DATE	and those of
1919	DATE	.

		The French Revolution , like the Russian , was acclaimed in
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- rope , particularly in
England	LOCATION	, as a forward step in the march of humanity toward freedom .

		Fox had the courage to stand out for the admission of the revolutionary state to the family of European nations .

		We can imagine him saying , in an old - fashioned way , that the treatment accorded to
France	LOCATION	by her sister nations was the acid test of their good-will , and of their intelligent and unselfish sym - pathy .

		But sympathy with
France	LOCATION	found no effect in action , while reprobation showed itself in hostility .

		Foreign intervention by intrigue and arms stung the Revolution into the Terror , and its leaders became outcast and adcursed of mankind .

		So with the Rus - sian Revolution .

		It is one of the ironies of history that Mr.
Lloyd George	PERSON	's proposal to admit Russian delegates to the Peace Conference should be an - swered by
France	LOCATION	in the words of
M. Pichon	ORGANIZATION	, which , as given in the
New York Times	ORGANIZATION	, might have been quoted from
Burke	LOCATION	on A Regicide Peace : The criminal regime of the Bolsheviki ... since it is supported solely by the lowest passions of anarchical oppression in negation of all the principles of public and private right , can not claim to be recognized as a regular Government ... The French Government ... will make no contract with crime .

		War forced the French Revolution to reprisals , and the Republic became predatory .

		Even so , sympathy , especially in
England	LOCATION	, died slowly .

		Long after the English Government had reconciled public opinion to war with
France	LOCATION	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	hoped for the defeat of the Allies of which his country was one .

		Then the Revolution brought forth a dictatorship , democracy turned imperialistic ,
Napoleon	PERSON	became the War Lord of
Europe	LOCATION	, and
England	LOCATION	complacently found herself the defender of the rights of nations , small and large .

		The tragedy was not that of
France	LOCATION	alone it was
England 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		The unearned moral increment which accrued to
England	LOCATION	from having her worse cause turn out to be the better by no virtue of her own was one of the fruitful causes of that hypocrisy , self-righteousness , and cant which
England	ORGANIZATION	's prophets , from
Carlyle	LOCATION	to
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	, have denounced .

		It was to the soul of the nation what rent was to its political economy it was poison .

		Nor will the present tragedy be
Russia	LOCATION	's alone it will be that of the Allies , of
America	LOCATION	.

		T L HE LIST OF TEACHERS DISMISSED OR SUSPENDED from the
New York	LOCATION	public schools in consequence of difference of opinion from the majority has re - ceived a notable addition in the name of
Benjamin Glassberg	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Glassberg	PERSON	was furnished a text - book on current history which he was told to teach '' with enthusiasm . ''

		This is apparently the book which makes such elaborate apology for the long continued neutrality of the
United States	LOCATION	that the late
Theodore Roosevelt	PERSON	requested that the record of his own contribution to the making of this par - ticular part of history be deleted .

		Had Mr.
Roose	PERSON	- velt been a teacher under the
New York School Board	ORGANIZATION	he would apparently have failed in enthusi - asm at this point and been subject to the tender mercies of Dr.
Tildsley	PERSON	.

		It was on the pages de - voted to the Russian Revolution that Mr.
Glass	PERSON	- berg 's enthusiasm seems to have flagged .

		At any rate it was on the day when he confessed certain doubts as to the extent to which
Lenin	ORGANIZATION	and Trotsky were German agents , and regretted that testimony in regard to the situation in
Russia	LOCATION	was suppressed , that twelve of his pupils -LRB- including the only ten Gentiles in the class -RRB- were summoned to the prin - cipal 's office to bear witness against him .

		There - upon Mr.
Glassberg	PERSON	was suspended without pay .

		Eight weeks have passed and he is still under sus - pension , with no charges filed against him .

		At last accounts the twelve witnesses were being subjected to continued examination by _ Principal
Raynor	PERSON	, and recently Dr.
Tildsley	PERSON	spent a day at the school col - lecting evidence .

		We can not think so ill of the
School Board	ORGANIZATION	as to imagine that if Mr.
Glassberg	PERSON	is ever tried he will be found guilty of anything unbecoming a teacher .

		On his acquittal perhaps he will be offered the terms presented to his prede - cessor in martyrdom , Mr.
Perlstein	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Perlstein	PERSON	was suspended without pay in
January 1918	DATE	, pre - sumably for lack of sympathy with the war .

		After serving the
U. S. Government	ORGANIZATION	for a year in uniform he is offered reinstatement without pay for the period of suspension .

		1919 THE DIAL A f * .

		SECOND CASE OF INTERFERENCE WITH THE freedom of thought and expression is reported from
the University of Montana	ORGANIZATION	.

		On
February 7	DATE	Chan - cellor E. C. Elliot '' suspended Professor
Louis Levine	PERSON	from further duty as a member of the fac - ulty , for insubordination and for unprofessional conduct prejudicial to the welfare of the
Univer	LOCATION	- sity . ''

		Professor
Levine	PERSON	's offense consisted in pub - lishing a monograph on
The Taxation of Mines	ORGANIZATION	in
Montana	LOCATION	, which showed considerable discrepancy between property owned and share of taxes paid by the
Anaconda Copper Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		According to Professor
Levine	PERSON	this investigation was under - taken with the consent of the Chancellor and on the understanding that the results should be pub - lished by the
University	ORGANIZATION	.

		The book was presented to the Chancellor , who praised it but demurred to its publication by the institution .

		Later the Chan - cellor advised , but did not order , that it be in - definitely withheld .

		Professor
Levine	PERSON	after sub - mitting his work to Professor
Seligman	PERSON	of
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	and Professor
Murray Haig	PERSON	, - who vouched for its impartial , scientific character , pub - lished it , as a '' service to all the people of the state . ''

		The Chancellor accordingly suspended Pro- fessor
Levine	PERSON	with the explanation : This suspension will remain in force until the board is called to give its consideration to the case , which involves the all-important questions as to whether the Chancellor 's policy of insisting that
University	ORGANIZATION	men shall not mix in legislative political controversies is a sound one for an institution created to serve fairly all the people of the state .

		We wonder which conception of public service , the teacher 's or the Chancellor 's , the people of Mon - tana will endorse .

		o SECONDARY FIGURE IN ENGLISH HISTORY IS better stamped on the imagination of succeeding generations than that of
George Jeffreys	PERSON	, the hang - ing judge , who made his progress through the Western counties after
Monmouth	PERSON	's insurrection , putting in force the Espionage Act of those days .

		It was not the unfairness of his trials or the ferocity of his sentences alone which accounts for the bad eminence which
Jeffreys	PERSON	has maintained : it was his brutal use of his position to bait the accused with bitter gibe and coarse abuse that has made him infamous .

		Nothing contributed more to the deep popular indignation which subverted the govern - ment in
1688	DATE	than the stories of
Jeffreys	PERSON	' trials .

		If there are any lessons to be learned from history this is one of them that of the abuses of government , one that the people find it hardest to forgive is the cowardly and bullying judge , who , safe on his bench , makes his sport out of the men and women who are entrusted to his conception of justice .

		In the records of trials in the last two years under the Espionage Act more than one
Jeffreys	PERSON	has been re - vealed among our federal judges .

		Among the many arguments in favor of immediate amnesty for politi - cal prisoners is this that in so many cases the trial judges allowed themselves to bring their own good faith and impartiality into question by taking sides violently or mockingly against the defendants .

		The records of these trials are permanent .

		They remain as evidence in the case of the people versus the
Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		In order to protect the prestige of government there has been defined the crime known as contempt of court , for which persons farthest removed from criminal have suffered severe penal - ties .

		It should be recognized that no contempt of court expressed from without is so dangerous as that of the court for itself , for its functions , and for the claims of justice which it is sworn to serve .

		Where the courts have in so many instances committed the crime of self-contempt , it is in their interest , and that of the
Government	ORGANIZATION	whose prestige they uphold , that we ask for amnesty for political prisoners .

		- L HE FIRST TEST OF THE SINCERITY OF THE NA - tions nominating themselves for the
Executive Council of the League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	will be the peace terms offered to
Germany	LOCATION	and
Austria	LOCATION	.

		The terms of the armistice were severe/and their severity has been increased with each renewal .

		There is ground for suspicion that President
Wilson	PERSON	consented to them in order to smooth the way for the acceptance of the Covenant .

		Now , however , the end of such diplomatic logrolling is in sight .

		The Covenant itself becomes void , and the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	a misnomer , unless such terms are granted
Germany	LOCATION	and
Austria	LOCATION	as to make their joint participation pos - sible .

		More than this , nothing is more certain than that the terms of revenge hitherto put forward by
Clemenceau	PERSON	,
Orlando	LOCATION	, and
Lloyd George	PERSON	will result in the downfall of the present moderately revolu - tionary government of
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Already the Junkers are merely biding their time a treaty of ruin signed by
Ebert	ORGANIZATION	will give them their opportu - nity .

		And behind them stand the .

		Sparticans the
Bolsheviki	LOCATION	.

		The revolution in
Bavaria	LOCATION	was a dress rehearsal a flash by a
Junker	PERSON	to set into explosion the magazine of proletarian wrath .

		We must not forget that the Allies are responsible for
Bolshevik Russia	LOCATION	.

		The stupid intrigues with counter-revolu - tionaries , coupled with the demand for an immediate offensive which President
Wilson	PERSON	voiced none too happily in the
summer of 1917	DATE	, brought about the downfall of Kerensky .

		History now threatens to repeat itself .

		It inevitably does repeat itself in the hands of such elder statesmen as compose the
Paris	LOCATION	Conference .

		We have no doubt whatever that President
Wilson	PERSON	knows perfectly this peculiarly of history and understands no less the character of the diplomats with whom he is dealing .

		The pregnant sentences near the close of his speech at
Boston	LOCATION	show that he is reading the hand-writing on the wall for their benefit .

		They also show that he knows the remedy which the situation de - mands .

		Has he the courage to apply it ?

		He has the foresight so had Cassandra .

		252 THE
DIAL March 8 Communications	ORGANIZATION	NATIONALITIES OR NATIONS SIR : The meaning of the world war will doubt - less be a subject of much variety of opinion .

		The degree in which its meaning is understood will mark the degree in which our reconstruction plans will proceed logically and progressively .

		It is then of utmost importance that we rightly grasp the meaning and lay a firm foundation for future peace and happiness .

		With this in mind we have read THE DIAL 'S suggestions regarding The Modern Point of View and the New Order , by Mr.
Thor	PERSON	- stein
Veblen	PERSON	, the editor '' in charge of the recon - struction program . ''

		We have noted that in the opinion of at least one thoughtful and analytic mind , gifted with the power of expressing itself , '' the object lesson enforced by recent and current events , in so far as concerns the material fortunes of the underlying community at large , as well as the keeping of peace , '' is '' that the most benefi - cent change that can conceivably overtake any ma - terial establishment would be to let it fall into innocuous desuetude .

		Apparently the less -LSB- of na - tional establishments -RSB- the better , with no apparent limit short of the vanishing point . ''

		At first we might suppose that here was a chronic individualist holding to that ancient maxim of democracy , that that '' government is best which governs least . ''

		But we find that really Mr.
Veblen	PERSON	finds no use for national government at all , for '' the new order in industry has no use or place for national dis - crimination , or national pretensions of any kind .

		... For industry as carried on under the new order , the overcoming of national discrimination is part of the ordinary day 's work '' although for the business community and '' the new order of business enterprise '' resting on intangible assets `` it is other - wise , '' for '' the business community has urgent need of an efficient national establishment . ''

		Now two things are , among many here , especially notable .

		First , that in the '' new order '' all na - tional establishment is weighed and found wanting .

		Second , that in the '' new order '' the wants of in - dustry and business enterprise are as divergent and hostile as in the old .

		Of course with such conceptions the new world which Mr.
Veblen	PERSON	foresees is nothing but a series of '' Balkan-state national establishments , '' each na - tion being '' an organization for collective offense and defense in peace and war essentially based on hate and fear of other nations . ''

		Whereas , had our '' diplomatic nation-makers '' the clever vision of their critic , they would see that '' nationalities get along well enough , to all appearances , without being ' nations ' in that militant and obstructive fashion that is aimed at in those projected creations of the diplomatic nation-makers . ''

		And Mr.
Veblen	PERSON	cites the Welsh and Scotch as nationalities as dis - tinguished from nations in the ordinary sense of the word .

		And while he regrets that '' it is not the object lesson of Welsh and Scotch experience that guides the new projects , '' he does not express any regret that the experience , somewhat more tragic , of some other nationalities which he mentions namely ,
Ireland	LOCATION	,
Finland	LOCATION	, and
Armenia	LOCATION	does not guide these new projects for sovereign states .

		Yet may it not be that it is the historic example of these latter nationalities which has led our '' diplomatic nation-makers '' to avoid , a repetition of horrors by clothing their creations with an organized power to look after themselves and to conclude that in a future where hate and rivalry are at least possibili - ties , in some quarter or other , a nationality vitalized into a nation might have as great capacity for use - fulness as a nationality without such an organization for its protection ?

		But to test the `` new order '' with the old which it must be admitted is capable of much improvement and may in a '' safely demo - cratic '' world be as different from the world we knew before
1914	DATE	as to be deserving of better names than Mr.
Veblen	PERSON	suggests may we not ask our - selves and him a few questions ?

		1 i -RRB- If the Allies at the
Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	set up only nationalities and not nations , what will speedily become of them , unless the Allies con - tinue to prepare for the defense of the liberties of their new creations ?

		-LRB- 2 -RRB- Is it not fair and just that these new creations should prepare to protect and defend them - selves ?

		Better a nation than a pauper na - tionality !

		-LRB- 3 -RRB- Is it not an undue bur.den on the peoples of the Allied nations that they alone make sacri - fices for the preservation ^ of the newly recog - nized self-governing nationalities of the world ?

		-LRB- 4 -RRB- After all , why should we all strive so hard for a '' new order '' in which the interests of indus - try and of the '' business community '' are so fatally antagonistic as they appear to be on Mr.
Veblen	PERSON	's showing ?

		Where will be the gain ?

		-LRB- 5 -RRB- Can we not conceive of a `` new order '' in which the nation might be organized and exist both to preserve the right and liberties of the nationality , which it embodied , and to aid in the orderly and fair adjustment of differences which exist between industry and business ?

		-LRB- 6 -RRB- Would not this second function justify the creation or continued existence of nations even if it is conceivable that nationalities might exist without such supervisory national organi - zation ?

		-LRB- 7 -RRB- But , finally , what choice would the nationality , let us say of
Poland	LOCATION	, or
Finland	LOCATION	, have to exist as an independent political entity or social or - ganization , without the protection of its own members or of friendly foreign nationalities ?

		Would it not be like the classic example of the snowball in Hades ?

		Or the cat that was born without claws ?

		THE WEB .

Frederic Arnold Kummer	PERSON	.

		Century ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		If the plotless novel were dependent upon such craftsmen as Sir
Gilbert	PERSON	and Mr.
Kummer	PERSON	to usher it into being , the probabilities are that it would stand forever without the portals .

		These two writers , though they differ in detail , dwell in closest harmony when it comes to frank and unfeigned reliance upon story .

		Give them plenty of incident , and they will undertake to carry the reader through somehow .

		They may ride roughshod over the tran - sitions ; they may give scant finish to characteriza - tion ; but how they warm to the demands of every twitch of action !

		Whatever their shortcomings , neither Wild Youth nor The Web may be branded with sluggish circulation .

		Sir
Gilbert	PERSON	rides his ink - pot into the rugged Canadian West , and there pulls his characters in and out of the picture with the careless authority of a motion-picture director .

		If a young girl is married to an old man , and the old man is cruel , and the young girl falls in love with a young man , then it follows that the old man must be put out of the way , and the fanatic fingers of a Chinaman are requisitioned .

		And if a young girl is too adorable to become the bride of uncouth Westerners , then a young nobleman , slightly wounded but otherwise perfect , will be spirited upon the scene .

		At times , one feels that Sir
Gilbert	PERSON	is scarcely more than one chapter ahead of the reader .

		... Mr.
Kummer	PERSON	's metier is military intrigue , with the late world securely impaled on his pen , while the reader and the enemy submit to simul - taneous baffling .

		But does The Web derive any added momentum from the disclosure that it is founded upon fact ?

		FORMATIVE TYPES IN ENGLISH POETRY .

		The
Earl Lectures	ORGANIZATION	of
1917	DATE	.

		By
George Herbert Palmer	PERSON	.


Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	.

		It is a rather formidable title which Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	elects to place at the head of his anything but for - midable volume .

		It is the kind of title that sug - gests the immense erudition of a
Saintsbury	LOCATION	, a Pan - coast , or a Skeats .

		But the reader need have no fear , for the author hastens to deny any but the most modest intentions as is befitting a confessed phil - osopher and amateur of the arts .

		Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	in - tends merely to sketch , in broad outlines , the chief poetic influences of English literature ; for this pur - pose he chooses six '' inevitables '' : Chaucer ,
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	,
George Herbert	PERSON	,
Alexander Pope	PERSON	,
Tenny	PERSON	- son , and
Browning	PERSON	.

		To each of these men he gives a competent essay , in which biography is mingled with an analysis of his subject 's particular contribu - tion to the English Parnassus .

		Throughout , the author 's chief criterion is the '' self-liberating '' quality of poetry : a great poet is essentially one who can broaden , deepen , and vivify one 's compre - hension of large life-forces through '' the conscious transmission of an emotional experience to another imaginative mind '' a doctrine of the '' utile '' which might conceivably bore some of the moderns but at least Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	does not compel the moderns to eat at his table .

		ANOTHER SHEAF .

		Scribner ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		By
John Galsworthy	PERSON	.

		In
John Galsworthy	PERSON	's new volume of essays readers may find a pleasure and satisfaction which many have restlessly missed in his recent fiction .

		Those later serials have shown such a lowering of his standards , such a lessening of his art , that many of his admirers have wondered if there would be a return of the magic of his early novels and his plays .

		Another Sheaf is not in the best
Galsworthy	PERSON	man - ner , but it is good .

		The style is less poetic , more prosaic , than was usual with him , and in places the diction tends surprisingly toward the trite .

		Only in the brief sketch at the beginning , The Road , do the words soar ; for the rest they trudge , but even so they do arrive .

		The road stretched in a pale , straight streak , narrow - ing to a mere thread at the limit of vision the only living thing in the wild darkness .

		All was very still .

		It had been raining ; the wet heather and the pines gave forth scent , and little gusty shivers shook the dripping birch trees .

		In the pools of sky , between broken clouds , a few stars shone , and half of a thin moon was seen from time to time , like the fragment of a silver horn held up there by an invisible hand , waiting to be blown .

		In subject matter these papers on various topics , gathered together without much effect of unity , are more closely related to
Galsworthy	PERSON	's plays than to his fiction .

		They deaf with social problems affecting the laboring classes of
England	LOCATION	, and through them the country as a whole .

		They have evidently seen publication before , and some of them are less timely now than when they were written .

		Their chief value lies in the author 's plea for recon - struction plans , for national policies that shall re - duce the dangers of the demobilization period and conserve the forces undestroyed by war .

		Galsworthy urges a sensible and just attitude toward the return - ing cripple not the maudlin emotion that cries out , '' Here 's a wounded hero ; let 's take him to the movies and give him tea ! ''

		but a wisdom that will give to the maimed a chance to do full work and - live a normal life .

		He is logical in his argument for the necessity of
England	LOCATION	's growing her own food , and shows the easy possibility of great agri - cultural schemes managed by the government .

		On the whole , his discussion of the problems of recon - struction is sane and admirable ; and his ideas for the most part are as applicable to
America	LOCATION	as to

		THE LIFE OF
DAVID BELASCO	PERSON	.

		By
William Winter	PERSON	.

		Moffat ,
Yard	LOCATION	;
$ 11	MONEY	.

		Well-written biographies are frequently more entertaining than fiction , for the details of life often possess a romance which the story-writer would not imagine .

		The novelist is likely to see only the con - spicuous in situation and character , while the true biographer perceives the slighter , more significant matters as well .

		The Life of
David Belasco	PERSON	, Wil - liam
Winter	DATE	's final work , possesses a double interest in that it is at once a valuable history of certain aspects of the American stage and a record of a life full of adventurous and colorful variety .

		There are , of course , many pages which only the student of stage history will linger over .

		There are sermonic passages that might have been omitted to advantage , not so much because they are digressions since digressions are often the part of a book most worth while as because they lack the author 's usual sanity of judgment .

		But the book is most readable .

		Belasco never staged a play more romantic than his own life .

		Born in a cellar in
San Francisco	LOCATION	, the son of an English harlequin who had come to this country in destitution , he has known the true dra - matic reversal of fortune .

		A Jew , he lived for several years in a monastery , under the training of a Catholic priest , whence he ran away to join a traveling circus as boy , clown .

		Riding on the hook and ladder wagon as the mascot of the
Victoria Fire Department	ORGANIZATION	, standing on a box to reach the ^ wash-tubs in order to help his mother with her work , hiding as a stowaway in a
Vancouver	LOCATION	boat , reciting '' shockers '' of his own composition in saloons and dives in
San Francisco	LOCATION	, he lived a life calculated to provide him abundant material for the sensational plays he later wrote .

		From the time when he was '' carried on '' as an infant in arms at the Victoria Theatre Royal he was always asso - ciated with the stage .

		He danced and played the banjo at cheap places , and once appeared as an Indian brave . ''

		I was too small , '' he says , '' but
Proctor	PERSON	kept me because I gave such fine war - whoops . ''

		These adventures of
Belasco	ORGANIZATION	's boyhood and youth are more entertainingly told than are his experiences in writing , adapting , acting , and produc - ing ; and the average reader will find more pleasure in the first volume than in the second .


William Winter	PERSON	does not hesitate to criticize his subject un - favorably on occasion , and his book is marked by a fine sincerity .

		RELIGION AND THE WAR : A Series of Essays on the War and Reconstruction .

		By
Members of the Faculty of the School of Religion	ORGANIZATION	,
Yale University	ORGANIZATION	.

		Edited by
Hasbey Sneath	ORGANIZATION	.


Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ i.	MONEY	With the exception of Essays III -LRB- The Christian Hope in Time of War , by
Frank Chamberlain Porter	PERSON	-RRB- and IV -LRB- Non-Resistance , Christian or Pagan , by
Benjamin M. Bacon	PERSON	-RRB- , this collection is typical of a great multitude of popular sermons and addresses of the last four years .

		As such it already belongs to a past era .

		The third essay is a scholarly discussion of what is known to theologians as the '' Eschatological Problem . ''

		It adopts the commonly accepted view of liberal Protestantism , but shows a lack of familiarity with some of the most recent contributions to the subject .

		The fourth essay is a polemic against the non-resistant pacificism of New Wars for Old by
John Haynes Holmes	PERSON	, and points out loopholes in the latter 's argument .

		Professor
Bacon	PERSON	admits that the teaching of Jesus was pacifis - tic , but denies that it was uniformly non-resistant .

		He does not explicitly answer the question , raised by his title , whether non-resistance be Christian or Pagan , though he quotes Buddha : With mercy and forbearance shalt thou disarm every foe .

		For want of fuel the fire expires : mercy and for - bearance bring violence to naught .

		But one would hardly classify this as a typically '' pagan '' saying .

		The group of essays does not address itself seri - ously to specific questions of reconstruction .

		It modestly contents itself with suggesting remedies of a most general nature .

March 8	DATE	and his background of facts is extensive .

		He can select from his mass of material the relevant and salient points which are needed for correct orienta - tion in so complex a subject .

		The final result is a clear and perceptive exposition of the peoples and political and social forces at work in that section of the world .

		Yet if Mr.
Price	PERSON	is careful to keep the general tone of his volume intelligently exposi - tory , the force of his few interpretive suggestions gains rather than loses by this method .

		Nothing is more revelatory than the quiet way , with unes - capable massing of fact on fact , in which Mr. Price shows that nationalism , beginning at first as a fruit - ful and tolerant cultural variation , has invariably been exploited by the imperialisms of
Russia	LOCATION	and
Turkey	LOCATION	always with the intriguing approval of the Great Powers for the purpose of setting one people at another 's throat .

		Nothing is more revela - tory than the quiet way in which he shows that this aggressive nationalism collapsed before the prole - tarian revolution .

		It must have thrilled the author to see Tartars , Armenians , and Russians amicably serving on the same committees to witness the rapprochement of so many nationalities formerly hostile .

Sedgwick Cooper	PERSON	.

		Doran ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		Those who have enjoyed Mr.
Cooper	PERSON	's delightful and informative volume on
Brazil	LOCATION	and the Brazilians will know what to expect of his latest book .

		Nor will they be disappointed .

		Mr.
Cooper	PERSON	is a broad - minded traveler who sees behind appearances ; he does not visit foreign countries with the preconceived notion of returning to show how superior is his own nation ; he journeys rather to learn from what he beholds , and to benefit both his own country and the land to which he comes by an exchange of ideas and a broadening of outlook that can not help but promote a fruitful understanding of each other .

		While the present book has as one of its main pur - poses the instruction of Northern business men in procuring South American trade , it may well be read to advantage by all who are interested in the continent to the south of us .

		As a nation we are sadly in need of the counsel here offered ; we must come to understand that differences in culture and language and habits are not necessarily signs of in - feriority or superiority ; they are differences .

		Particularly interesting in the book , which is written in an easy colloquial style and is replete with humorous anecdotes -LRB- very much to the point -RRB- and significant experiences of the author , are the chapters dealing with the Oriental psychology of the South American , the German penetration into the continent , the South American cowboy that `` gaucho '' about whom has sprung up a literature all his own and a fairly full treatment of
Peru	LOCATION	and the
Incas	LOCATION	.

		Nothing better can be said of any book than that it fulfills its purpose ; one rises from Mr.
Cooper	PERSON	's book with a mind much enlightened as to the other half of
America	LOCATION	.

		THE WAR IN THE CRADLE OF THE WORLD .

		By
Eleanor Franklin Egan	PERSON	.

		Harper ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		Since there is legitimate doubt as to where the infant world was cradled , let it be said at once that the author with a confidence which is her leading trait and alter or rather ipsissimus ego identifies the cradle with the ancient land of
Mesopotamia	LOCATION	.

		Her book deals with the British end of the war there in its final triumphant stages .

		By a miracle of favor bewildering even to herself , not readily given to be - wilderment , she was permitted to penetrate to the theater of operations and , politely handed by busy officials from post to post across the dusty desert spaces , she came at last to
Bagdad	LOCATION	the Wonderful and to the presence of the
Army Commander	ORGANIZATION	, Sir
Stanley Maude	PERSON	.

		In spite of its martial title this is not a book of military operations but rather of im - pressions of things seen , heard , and sensed among the scorched and pathless wastes of a land of fable ; and since the writer possesses unusual powers of ob - servation and a deft and very feminine pen , the result is not that the land ceases to be fable that is fortunately impossible but that the fable .

		is il - lustrated and enriched by mirages and dream-pic - tures so colorful and seductive that the issue of reality loses interest .

		But and now we come to what for the author is doubtless the effective purpose of the book against the filmy fable of the land , and thrown upon it as upon a moving screen is a vividly contrasting thing , utterly real and palpable the British war prepara - tions .

		The reader is made to see , streaming into
Mesopotamia	LOCATION	along with the supplies from the great base at
Bombay	LOCATION	the rows of troop and cargo ships , the acres of choked wharves at
Basra	LOCATION	, the brown tent-cities running off into the desert haze till they are lost from sight , the stacked pyramids of hay and wheat under sloping canvas , the endless supply trains of donkeys and camels winding in ant-like lines toward the horizon in short , a titanic labor of countless details and infinite pains constituting a masterpiece of organization .

		A British masterpiece .

		The American author reveals a state of mind as interesting to study as it is necessary to reckon with as we approach the hour when the world is expected to give birth to the new internationalism with which it is even now declared to be in labor .

		AMERICAN PROBLEMS OF RECONSTRUCTION .

		Edited by
Elisha M. Friedman	PERSON	.

		Dutton ;
$ 4	MONEY	.

		This is a national symposium to which American economists , statesmen , financiers , and business men have made their contributions .

		The book is a strik - ing contrast to the English symposium published earlier , in
1917	DATE	.

		The latter reflected an unmistak - able concern among the leaders of industrial enter - prise in regard to
England	LOCATION	's economic position at - , the termination of the war , and their belief that
England	LOCATION	's future is dependent on industry becoming a matter of national concern and national organiza - tion .

		In our American symposium there is an as - surance that
America	LOCATION	, the land of unlimited re - sources , has nothing to fear and no serious amends to make .

		The measures of economy which are advocated in this symposium have no revolutionary import .

		They have to do with a perfection of economy in methods already in use ; with a strength - ening rather than a reorganization of our present institutions .

		Much of the book is , indeed , concerned with a review of our actual and potential wealth : the status of our mineral resources , the possibilities of increasing technical research , the accomplished mechanics of labor efficiency , and the future possi - bilities of scientific management in the hands of ex - perts .

		Emphasis is laid on the advantages of priv - ate ownership of railroads with government regu - lation , the development of a merchant marine with government backing and regulation , the value to
America	LOCATION	of a free port , such as the free port of
Hamburg	LOCATION	; a moderate shifting of inequalities of wealth through taxation on incomes , consumption , lands , inheritance , and business .

		Our agricultural problem , it seems , might be solved if we gave suffi - cient attention to the kind of '' containers '' used in shipping , to better cold storage accommodations , some modification of the produce exchanges .

		There is appreciation that in the rehabilitation of war - stricken
Europe	LOCATION	American investors and financiers have an unusual opportunity .

		In short , the volume seems to stand for a policy which will trust indus - try and trade to the leadership of
America	LOCATION	's busi - ness men and financiers , and which will give them the backing and full force of state approval .

		The last chapter is a singular appreciation of Prussianism , which if issued by an I.W.W. organi - zation might have been lost in Mr.
Burleson	PERSON	's dis - card .

		The author believes in the centralized execu - tive leadership , in what he calls '' a well disciplined line organization , '' and a highly specialized staff or - ganization .

		To these most important provisions of an autocratic state he adds the feeble recommenda - tion of criticism , publicity , and '' effective control in the hands of the people . ''

		The latter seems to mean , so far as one can read between the lines , a universal ballot .

		How treacherous a dependence a ballot is , in a less centralized government than
Germany	LOCATION	's , we all know .

		How little a people for their protection can depend upon popular criticism and publicity , we also know from our own very recent experience .

		One of the contributors to the symposium , Mr.
Louis B. Wehle	PERSON	, also welcomes centralized gov - ernment control .

		His experience on the
Shipping Board	ORGANIZATION	induces his enthusiastic support of shop com - mittees made up of workers who will take up con - ditions of employment with the management .

		The author does not specifically recommend that they constitute a unit of industrial administration , but the general temper of this chapter suggests that the author would be less hostile to influences which were truly democratic than the other contributors to the symposium .

		Nowhere in the symposium , unless in this chapter , is there an intimation that the American economists , financiers , and business men welcome the introduction of any scheme which might impair a centralized control of production of wealth .

		GEORGE MEREDITH : A Study of His Works and Personality .

		By
J. H. E. Crees	PERSON	.

		Long - mans ,
Green	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		That the
Essay on Comedy	ORGANIZATION	presents its author 's conception of the true aim of the novel ; that
Meredith	PERSON	satirized sentimentalists and delighted in the poetry of youth ; that '' his verse is lacking in the finest sense of form '' ; that his obscurity '' pro- ceeds from high-strained intellectual activity , not from laziness or incompetence '' ; that novels are written '' to show characters in action and develop - ment '' ; that `` we do not in real life talk like Meredithian characters , '' are among the not un - familiar conclusions reached by Mr.
Crees	PERSON	in his two hundred odd pages devoted to
George Meredith	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Crees	PERSON	announces that probably every one who journeys through
Meredith	PERSON	will prefer to tell his own story .

		Granted that this be true , there seems to be nothing so novel about Mr.
Crees	PERSON	' itinerary that he should tell it out loud .

		Perhaps the most interesting fact about the book is that Mr.
Crees	PERSON	is the author of The Reign of the Emperor Probus and headmaster of a grammar school .

		These facts may explain his continual hank - ering after the Greeks .

		Every now and then , while the critic is talking about
Meredith	PERSON	, one has an un - easy suspicion that he would much prefer to chat about Euripides .

		If Mr.
Crees	PERSON	had had the courage of his instincts he might have given us a pretty study of the Hellenic aspects of Meredith ; but he prefers to talk about enthousiasmos and to write a book which , if it is nowhere wrong , is not indispensable .

		The obvious charge that can be brought against this poetical venture by the author of Thorgils and The Forest Lovers is that no village wife could possibly deliver herself of such a sustained and com - paratively philosophic utterance on the horrors of war .

		But Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	himself removes the sting of this criticism by admitting its validity , in the brief Note appended to the poem ; wherein also he utters a few prose lamentations inspired by the war , more rhetorical than profound as when he affirms that '' German blood-lust will become one of the standing legends of history . ''

		The poem itself is in homely vein , as befits the rustic setting and the speaker : there is something of the old Dutch genre painters in this picture of peasant life simplicity , drudgery , resignation , and a passionate attachment to all things of .

		the earth earthy .

		One witnesses the effect of war upon the bride of a sturdy English yokel , the raw anguish of separation , the fierce dumb hatred of bloodshed above all , anger at war 's interference with the even current of obscure and contented lives .

		The sixty odd pages of the Lament make rather difficult reading for the sophisticated urban mind , so long fed on controversy , worn out ?

		by absurd quibblings and subtle distinctions ; but to one who can make due allowance for these factors ,
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	's poem will bring enough pleasure to justify very favorable comparison with most of our '' war-poetry . ''

		THREE LIVE GHOSTS .

		By
Frederic S. Isham	PERSON	.

		Bobbs-Merrill ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Mr.
Isham	PERSON	's novel is depressing .

		Its qualities are not the result of amateur writing ; they are the deliberate result of professional belief in patterns for light fiction .

		His situation has possibilities : three soldiers , escaping from a German prison , find themselves , upon their return to
London	LOCATION	, officially dead .

		But the possibilities are at once lost in a mesh of devices for provoking laughter , sympathy , applause .

		The characters Lord , cockney , and rich American are the stock figures of farce , unchanged by war or uniforms .

		They move through the book after the manner of clay pigeons in a shooting gal - lery , pulled along from outside .

		A dramatic critic recently suggested that in pro- hibition lay hope for the musical comedy and the farce , since future audiences must be cold and sober .

		What of book readers ?

		The author must be given credit for a diversity of setting , a wide vocabulary , and a discursive imagination ; but the tales , are bookish and garrulous , and disappoint the reader by their failure in emphasis .

		Before Mr.

America	LOCATION	's splendid success in a war waged against foreign autocracy , our country is menaced by the growing power of an autocratic and reactionary minority at home .

		We stand in danger of losing many of the liberties and advances won in the course of our national development .

		There is grave likelihood of our being left stagnant and backward in a world that for the most part is vigorously reorganizing its economic and political life .

		Centralization and autocracy are increasing rapidly in the organization of government , in the control of credit , and in the determination of public opinion .

		The very classes whose labors in factory and field are the basis and substance of our economic power , find no effective political medium through which to express their economic demand , but by deceptive diversions of our party-system are denied their proper representation in the law-making bodies of the nation .

		/ `` CRITICISM , competent or not , is discouraged ; periodicals \ ^ ji are suppressed with hardly a pretense of adequate hear - ing ; public assemblies meeting under constitutional guar - antees are dispersed by official force or by mob violence bred of official intolerance ; our women are subjected to unwarranted delays in their campaign for the fulfilment of democracy ; agricultural and labor organizers and political heretics are not only suppressed but are in many cases sent to penitentiaries for terms whose unprecedented severity would surprise even the fallen despots of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Meanwhile the cost of armaments , the orgies of profiteering , the extravagances of administration , the expense of innumer - able agencies of suppression combined with the lack of any intelligent and far-sighted budget system , swell the public debt , devouring loans and revenues before they can be collected , and sending prices always beyond the reach of fifteen million families whose physical and intellectual well being are the final test of our collective development and survival .

		It is the privilege of
America	LOCATION	, protected by its vestige of geographical seclusion , to profit by the experiences of
Europe	LOCATION	.


Europe	LOCATION	too has had its reactionary ruling minorities , its in - dustrial autocrats , its financial oligarchies , its massive armaments , its hated conscription , its corrupt and futile politics , its suppression of dissent , its judicial frightfulness , its bursting budgets , its toilers broken in body and bitter of soul .

		And
Europe	LOCATION	has revolution .

		Is this what Americans want ?

		We do not think so .

		We believe that there is intelligence enough in this country , if it will but come together , to catch control of the current of things and co-operate directively with the inevitable forces of human growth .

		To Reaction and Revolution we oppose Re - construction ; not as a catchword and -LRB- pretense , but as an organized effort to find some new adjustment of the changing powers that constitute society .

		Many _ of us believe that these readjustments demand a new political alignment , that the old parties are determined to withhold that which the American people are determined to have .

		Day by day men come _ to see more clearly that these organizations have ` lost that spirit to serve the people which was embodied once in
Jefferson	LOCATION	and at another time in
Lincoln	LOCATION	; that the shell has hardened and stifled the growth within .

		With exceptions lost among the instances , the politicians whom we have elected have misrepresented our desires and laughed at our hopes ; they have opposed with a cynical accord all that we have set our hearts on as vital to the renovation of Amer - ican life .

		There are times when by the vigor of a personality , the old mechanisms are driven to some efficacy and result ; but the mechanism soon overcomes the man , pushes him aside , and undoes his little work .

		America can not grow much more in these old skins .

		Rather must reconstruction derive its impetus and direction from the political organization of the manual and mental work - ers of the country .

		The future belongs not to the inheritors and manipulators of great wealth but to the men and women who live by their work of hand or brain and know by hard experience the needs and aspirations of the common life .

		It is the purpose of the
Committee of Forty-Eight	ORGANIZATION	to sum - mon from all parts of the country the leaders of its liberal thought and of its forward-looking citizens , to meet in confer - ence .

		We hope that out of this assemblage of the hitherto scattered forces of Americanism will come a flexible statement of principles and methods that will permit effective co-operation with organized Labor and Agricultural workers in the tasks of social reconstruction .

		So we send out this call .

		It is not such an opportunity as comes with every day .

		The world is fluent now , and responds readily to every moulding force ; but let it find a form and it will congeal again into resistance and immobility .

		All minds are awake today , as seldom before , all hearts ^ are astir with hopes and open to large purposes ; but these minds will shrivel once more into their grooves , these hopes will lose their glow , if we miss this chance to organize the liberal intelligence of Amer - ica into coherent voice and form .

		It may be the final opportunity of our generation .

		It is testimony by way of literature as to what the ordinary French man is ; it is a survey of souls stripped naked by the wild hands of war .

		It is the story of a keeper and accountant of corpses who though he can not keep the count loves them and all their little individualities as if they were living people .

		A FORTNIGHTLY How to
Treat Germany	LOCATION	WH ` HAT is AT THE BOTTOM of the feeling of paraly - sis and pessimism which , by universal consent , is so current in
Paris	LOCATION	after two months of labor by the Conference ?

		One may point to a few illuminating factors .

		Entente policy particularly French policy is at this moment directed towards two mutually exclusive objects , two divergent ends .

		Let us take the ^ material aspect first .


M. Tardieu	PERSON	declared the other day that
Germany	LOCATION	must be pre - vented from reestablishing her industries , because economic restoration would ultimately lead to mili - tary restoration , and because , since
Germany	LOCATION	had not been devastated , she would be able to restore her industries very much more rapidly than
France	LOCATION	and so by advantage in competition strangle French trade permanently kill
France	LOCATION	as an economic rival .

		That this is a popular French view will be proved by a five minute talk with a French tradesman .

		Yet sooner or later it will be necessary to com - pel French opinion and Allied opinion generally to face the fact that if
Germany	LOCATION	is to pay an indemnity , even to help Belgian and French restora - tion in a moderate degree , she must be permitted to reestablish her industries , particularly her agri - culture and communications .

		The view expressed in the press is that
Germany	LOCATION	's shortness of food , lack of locomotives , and loss of agricultural ma - chinery is a just punishment .

		Granting that this is sound enough morally , to couple it with the de - mand for big indemnities as part of the punishment is to ask economic miracles .

		It must by now be obvious that without ample food , raw materials , and improved communications ,
Germany	LOCATION	can pay no indemnity worth while .

		But the present French temper insists not alone on economic but on political and moral miracles .

		We are asking that the people whom we declare to be the least politically minded in
Europe	LOCATION	, the most wedded to discipline and routine , shall , as an earnest of their intention to break with the past , not only in a few weeks sweep away twenty dynasties and establish a parliamentary republic , but shall , during the widespread chaos of defeat and revolution and demobilization , tear up all their political institutions by the roots , including the bureaucratic organizations of twenty states organ - izations which can alone prevent reconstruction de - veloping into anarchy .

		We take it as proof of ob - stinate persistence in sin that officials of the old order still remain , that old political parties , with slight change of program , still retain much power .

		Nevertheless while we refuse to believe in any change in the German heart because of this failure to make root and branch changes , we insist , almost in the same breath , that any drift of power to the extreme left , any capture of the government by Bolshevism , will be proof of the nation 's intention to evade its obligations by '' organized disorder , '' and will be ample justification for our military oc - cupation of the country .

		Nor is this all .

		We demand as final proof of change of heart that all attempts to revive the coun - try 's military power be abandoned : that it turn from this preoccupation altogether .

		Yet meantime we make no provision for insuring the German people protection for those rights which we have again and again declared she is entitled to , what - ever her guilt the right , for instance , of indis - putably German populations to self-determination .

		In
East Prussia	LOCATION	,
West Prussia	LOCATION	,
Silesia	LOCATION	,
Dantzig	PERSON	,
German Bohemia	LOCATION	, are populations whose precise na - tionality the
Allied Conference	ORGANIZATION	admits still remains to be determined .

		That must be the work of the
Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	.

		But meantime Polish or Czecho - slovak troops , or the Polish or Czech sections of the population , take measures to forestall the de - cision of the
Conference	ORGANIZATION	and present it with a fait accompli .

		What is
Germany	LOCATION	to do ?

		Acquiesce in the subjugation of German populations ?

		Would not that be asking for a / ^ - patriotism which we declare to be a crime in the case of other peoples ?

		No nationally minded people in the world will take such a position .

		To ask it is , again , to ask moral miracles .

		Two courses are open : either to make it plain to the German people that we intend to pro- tect their nationality against the attacks of even our own Allies , Polish or Czecho-Slovak , and for that purpose will refuse aid and will even restrain those Allies when they attempt to anticipate the decisions of the Peace Conference ; or to allow Ger - 280 THE DIAL
March 22	DATE	many to organize her own defense by the recreation of some measure of her former military power .

		We do not in any real sense adopt the former policy -LRB- beyond a Platonic lecture to unnamed parties on the wickedness of trying to present the Conference with a fait accompli -RRB- , and when as an inevitable consequence
Germany	LOCATION	herself adopts the second we point to it as proof of her incurable militarism and duplicity .

		We go still further .

		Observing that
Germany	LOCATION	's sufferings have provoked in the people , not a sense of guilt , but only a sense of self-pity , we demand some dramatic and visible sign of repentance , although we admit that the failure to realize any sense of guilt is caused partly by the way in which the late government managed to hide from the people the moral facts of the war and partly by the way in which a narrow-visioned people tend to con - centrate their emotions upon the sufferings of which they are victims and to blame those sufferings to their enemy .

		Obviously our primary task is to show the German people not by our words and our propaganda , but by our acts and our policy , that they have been lied to concerning the character of their enemy and his objects , and that the way of '' repentance '' is a way which a German with due regard to future and consequently innocent German generations can tread .

		It ought to be clear that there can be no sense of guilt or of moral inferiority on
Germany	LOCATION	's part if her present enemies are guilty to any degree of the very crimes of which we want the German people to repent .

		Yet there is a dangerous tendency in Allied opinion at this moment to refuse con - demnation of certain Allied policies because they are venial compared to the monstrousness of the German offense .

		Any criticism , say , of the pro- posed annexation of the left bank of the Rhine , or of the blockade , or of the retention of German prisoners for forced labor , or of Polish ,
Czecho	PERSON	- slovak , Roumanian , or Italian plans of conquest , is met by the citation of much greater offenses on the part of
Germany	LOCATION	.

		This is mere moral chaos .

		Because one man is a murderer does not excuse another man for being a thief .

		The government of peoples against their wish will not be less polit - ically demoralizing on Czechs , Poles , Italians , and French because in the past Czechs , Poles , Italians , and French have themselves been governed against their wish .

		But more pertinently perhaps , Ger - mans will not be helped to see the wickedness of allowing children to be drowned at sea as part of a military policy by seeing their own children starved to death as part of a peace policy .

		That is not the way human nature works ; it is to mis - construe it altogether , and particularly to miscon - strue stupid or criminal human nature which we declare German nature to be .

		The stupider and narrower the German mentality the more likely are Germans to take some feature of our policy as proof that the Allies are capable , when their policy de - mands it , of cruelty as great as that of which the Germans were guilty .

		Since the Armistice we have given them plenty of excuses for that interpretation of our acts .

		And such a conclusion is fatal to that sense of moral inferiority which is the beginning of a sense of guilt .

		Indeed it may be asked if it is not already too late for German repentance .

		For there are certain features of Allied policy which are particularly impressing German imagina - tion at this moment and tending to form the German attitude , to shape the German policy .

		The first is the fact of the blockade maintained after
Germany	LOCATION	's naval disarmament .

		It raises the whole question of '' navalism '' versus '' Freedom of the Seas '' in its acutest form .

		The position of
Germany	LOCATION	is much worse in this respect after the disappearance of her fleet than it was when she was a great naval power .

		The Baltic at least was open to her trade during the war .

		Now it is closed .

		Not only is it closed to mer - chant shipping : even fishing is stopped .


Germany	LOCATION	's fishermen are not even allowed to add to the slender store of food in the home country .

		Meantime the Armistice demand for the delivery of agricultural machinery , taken in conjunction with transport dis - location and the loss of fertilizers , threatens to make the coming harvest the worst that
Germany	LOCATION	has known .

		But the fact which more than anything else per - haps is molding the feelings and opinions which will determine the direction to be taken by the new Ger - many is the proposed retention of the prisoners of war for forced labor in
France	LOCATION	.

		The term '' pro- posed '' does not mean that the proposal has been put forward by the French government and one may hope that no such idea has been seriously en - tertained but that it is currently discussed in the French press .

		It is commonly defended as a '' stern but just measure , '' justified by the dev - astation which ''
Germany	LOCATION	'' has wrought .

		Let us examine its justice by reference to the realities of responsibility .

		Here is an individual German prisoner : a young married peasant -LRB- among the prisoners , by the way , arc Poles ,
Danes	LOCATION	, Alsatians ,
Bavarians	LOCATION	, Austrians , and Slavs of various branches -RRB- .

		At home he has a wife and two young children .

		He was captured early in the war and has been a prisoner for nearly five years .

		Here is another of different type : a music teacher , dreamy , artistic , unpractical .

		At home he supported his mother .

		Incidentally his physique makes him a poor laborer .

		He also has
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 281 lived nearly five years in a prison camp .

		In a few years , as with many others , his mind will have gone .

		To the five years these men have already suffered it is proposed to add five , ten , or fifteen years more of penal servitude .

		For what crime that they in - dividually have committed ?

		It is not even alleged that they have taken part in the unnamable atroci - ties that marked the march of their army .

		Are they to be punished for being a part of the army for having submitted to conscription in the early part of the war ?

		But we ourselves have laid down the law that a conscript can not refuse to serve merely because he disapproves of the political purpose for which a war is fought .

		These two prisoners , like so many others , were very hazy in their political opinions .

		Suddenly , out of the blue , they -RRB- had been told that their country was at war that it had been attacked .

		They knew nothing of the Serbian ulti - matum , of Balkan quarrels .

		They had no means of getting at the facts .

		They knew as little of them as did hundreds of thousands of Russian conscripts who were mobilizing on the other side of the fron - tier .

		They had been taught as Russians , Japanese , Italians , French , British , and Americans are taught
today	DATE	that it was their duty to respond to their .

		country 's call wfthout too much questioning of the orders of the constituted authorities , still less with - out questioning what foreigners said against their country .

		They knew they were perhaps going to their deaths ; they knew that for them there would be neither profit nor glory they obeyed .

		And now , with no reference whatever to any special guilt even alleged against them , they will be condemned to half a lifetime of penal servitude .

		Their children will grow to manhood and womanhood in
Germany	LOCATION	, knowing that their father for no proved or even alleged offense is , by the very nations ` that have declared they fought a war for justice and right , held in slavery .

		For
Germany	LOCATION	a legend will grow out of this war .

		The children who have never seen their fathers those fathers thus reduced to slavery will be the disseminators of this legend .

		And finally in ten , twenty , or thirty years , when Ger - many has in some measure regained her strength perhaps , and the whirligig of politics has given her new allies in an organized
Russia	LOCATION	or a Danubian Confederation , these million men , enflamed with the memory of a lifetime of slavery , will return to their country to be part of that public opinion which must be rallied to the support of that new world which we must build , Mr.
Lloyd George	PERSON	tells us , '' on exact and scrupulous justice , on high ideals of right - eous humanity and generosity . ''

		It is thus that Ger - many is to be won from her old evil past of mili - tarism , suspicion , distrust , and hate .

		And meantime of course , in these lesser wars be - tween Poles and Ukrainians , or Czecho - Slovaks and Roumanians which we seem unable to prevent since they are now going on the same methods will be justified .

		Polish landowners will in the future use their influence with their governments to hold Russian or Slovak prisoners of war to forced labor as part of a just indemnity .

		The new world of Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's
Society of Nations	ORGANIZATION	will be singu - larly like an older world in which peoples could be carried into captivity , a world which we thought to have left behind us some thousand years ago .

		Now it is most unlikely that there is any intention whatsoever of putting such a policy - as this into execution .

		But in that case would it not be as well to say so explicitly before the mere rumor has grown into an all but indestructable legend in
Germany	LOCATION	, a legend it may take years to destroy ?

		The fact is that the success of the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	will now depend less upon the form of machinery which the Allies may devise than upon whether the spirit which must animate any success - ful
League	ORGANIZATION	is imported into their actual policy towards one another and towards the enemy during the next few months .

		What are the elements of success in that policy ?

		They might be enumerated as follows : 1 i -RRB- Any dependable policy of German disarmament must be preceded by an obvious intention on the part of the Allies to protect German rights and to act impartially ; to oppose unjust claims , whether made by Czechs , Italians , French , or Poles .

		-LRB- 2 -RRB- If an idealistic policy is proclaimed , it must be carried out sincerely .

		-LRB- After inviting the
Bolshe	LOCATION	- viki to meet Allied representatives and to arrange a truce , the newspapers bring us news of -LRB- a -RRB- '' great Allied victories against the Bolsheviki troops '' in the Northern Territories and -LRB- b -RRB- a statement by
M. Pichon	PERSON	that the Allies had never invited the Bolsheviki to meet Allied representa - tives though the names of the delegates had been published but only to talk with other Rus - sian governments ! -RRB-

		-LRB- 3 -RRB- We must realize that if
Germany	LOCATION	is to pay an indemnity or to help in reconstructing
France	LOCATION	and
Belgium	LOCATION	we must adopt a policy which will help instead of hindering her starting fyer na - tional life after the dislocation of defeat and rev - olution .

		The blockade must be relaxed -LRB-
M. Klotz	PERSON	demands its stiffening '' in the interest of French industry '' ! -RRB-

		, and such things as the pro- hibition of Baltic fisheries must not be attempted .

		-LRB- 4 -RRB- An end should be put to such legends as the intention of retaining prisoners of war for long periods as forced laborers .

		There should be im - mediate repatriation of the sick and wounded and 282 THE DIAL
March 22	DATE	some definite arrangements made concerning the repatriation of the others .

		-LRB- 5 -RRB- Seizure of German rolling stock , agricultural machinery , and so on should be guided by the need for the greatest total world production of food during the coming year .

		-LRB- 6 -RRB- In order to help keep certain too clever poli - ticians up to the standard they proclaim in the matter of high ideals and the abandonment of imperialistic aims , and so on , the censorship should be abolished entirely , and the utmost publicity of all negotiations from now on demanded .

		And since Allied correspondents are now freely ad - mitted into
Germany	LOCATION	and
Austria	LOCATION	, opinion in those countries would be greatly helped in their fight against the '' old gang '' and their counter - revolutionary intrigues if they had correspond - ents in the Allied capitals who could give sym - pathetic interpretations of news items exploited by German reactionaries in an anti-Entente sense .

Paris	LOCATION	.

		Passed by Base Censor ,
A. E. F. Good Form	ORGANIZATION	and Orthodoxy OIR ARTHUR QUILLER-COUCH offers us in his Studies in Literature -LRB-
Putnam	LOCATION	;
$ 2.50	MONEY	-RRB- a series of very pleasant talks on life and letters , most of which were originally given before a class of un - dergraduates at
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		There is nothing here to match the acerbity of the famous essay on Jargon -LRB- terrifying to journalists -RRB- in the earlier volume , On the Art of Writing .

		And naturally not , since Sir
Arthur	PERSON	is dealing with established excellence and not with the slackness of his contemporaries .

		He is , indeed , hardly at his best in the immediate present .

		For a novelist , he has an oddly cloistral spirit and unadventurous nerves ; the fluid , shifting world seems to elude and irritate him until it has been immobilized in a masterpiece or turned into the abstract nobility of a verbal symbol .

		To these he gives his fullest loyalty .

		It is a way to be quiet .

		It is a way to possess oneself and not to be possessed by change .

		There is a phrase of
Wordsworth	PERSON	's that is often on his lips that `` wise passivity '' which is the ultimate wisdom for poets .

		Well , Sir
Arthur	PERSON	has something like a gift for passivity , and the writers who reflect it have , I suspect , his special devotion .

		But he is catholic and a genuine lover of literature , whose enthusiasms are none the less real for being invariably temperate and mellow .

		You feel only that they have been lived with for a long time and have thus acquired all the self - authenticating force of old habits in this case , in - deed , almost of national habits , for Sir
Arthur	PERSON	is rarely idiosyncratic .

		To defend them excitedly would occur to him as little as to urge them on others with missionary zeal .

		Accordingly , his man - ner is as far as possible from the dogmatic .

		He recommends ; he never imposes .

		And he recom - mends with a charming urbanity which is possible , I think , only to the critic who relies wholly on taste and prefers to remain silent on most of the prob - lems about which taste has nothing very profitable to say .

		The material here is , for the most part , so familiar
Coleridge	PERSON	,
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	,
Meredith	PERSON	,
Swinburne	LOCATION	, Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	that the chief problem is -LRB- for so expert a craftsman as Sir
Arthur	PERSON	-RRB- the always congenial one of handling .

		Sir
Arthur	PERSON	has a great deal of the French neatness .

		The essays flow smoothly in themselves and flow smoothly into one another with just the right degree of casual - ness to efface the last trace of effort .

		-LRB- In essence this is only literary good form . -RRB-

		There is nothing of pedantry and no hint of a worked-up theme .

		Sir
Arthur	PERSON	is simply sharing his discoveries in a field that stimulates his spontaneous interests .

		I have said that he is rarely idiosyncratic , except in a touch here and there of the romantic , as in what he has to say of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's premature exhaustion : `` In other words , let us inquire if , in a man who performed that miracle -LSB- The Ancient Mariner -RSB- , his failure to perform others may not more charitably be set down to a divine exhaustion than charged upon his frailties . ''

		Like
James Dykes Campbell	PERSON	-LRB-
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's biographer -RRB- , Sir
Arthur	PERSON	indeed honors the poet 's memory throughout only a little `` on this side idolatry . ''

		Towards those who are more nearly his contemporaries
Meredith	PERSON	,
Swinburne	PERSON	and Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	Sir
Arthur	PERSON	adopts a more reserved tone , and , especially in the bio - graphical sketch of
Swinburne	LOCATION	, a less conventional note than elsewhere in dealing with established greatness .

		True , he only follows here Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	's example in discreetly agitating but never lifting the veil before that `` great figure , a spent god and asleep under the pines -LSB-
Putney	LOCATION	-RSB- . ''

		But in resort - ing even to agitation , Sir
Arthur	PERSON	rather exceeds his usual practice .

		The tone is more likely to be that in which he writes of
George Herbert	PERSON	: '' A life as you read of it in
Walton	LOCATION	so delicately holy , so fragrant of the
Wiltshire	LOCATION	water meadows along which the biographer himself wandered with his rod , fishing for trout and ` studying to be quiet , ' THE DIAL 283 that it seemed made to tick on and on like a well - oiled clock . ''

		In a word , the impression one gets is that of a prevailing orthodoxy .

		I do n't refer to Sir
Arthur	PERSON	's gingerly attitude to `` doctrine , '' which is that of a cat with hot milk .

		After all , some allowance must be made , I suppose , for any
King Edward VII	ORGANIZATION	Professor of English Literature in the
University of Cambridge	ORGANIZATION	, though it becomes in - creasingly hard to visualize the force of that particu - lar taboo in
John Bull 's Island	LOCATION	and reconcile it with other forces now rather noticeably at work .

		Even the stupendous paradox of Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	does n't help us much .

		No .

		The orthodoxy here is stretched to cover the Englishman 's customary world from the periphery of Empire to th6 center of good form , which Sir
Arthur	PERSON	never sees as a possible ex - tinguisher of thought , but only as an ultimate achievement in the world-old struggle to produce the first man made perfect .

		Now , in this strident world , it is the exceptionally noisy persons who identify themselves with terms and make the terms over in their own image , and so Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	has misled many who are less familiar with ortho - doxy than were our grandfathers .

		But he is largely a sham .

		Orthodoxy consists in believing what your fathers believed and not in finding reasons why you need not disbelieve .

		Sir
Arthur	PERSON	really apprehends the rnood , whereas Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	means little more than loyalty to your private idiosyncrasies camouflaged in the correct institutional wardrobe .

		The difference is considerable .

		Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's orthodoxy does not relieve the cerebral strain to which he is put every time he indicts an article .

		If anything , he has more trouble than the heterodox , because he is always thinking of them and trying to circumvent their subtle wickedness .

		But they do not enter into Sir
Arthur	PERSON	's mind at all , and orthodoxy means for him precisely what it should mean a quiet conscience .

		He has been ruffled as little by the war as by the intellectual ferment that preceded it ; he has lived straight on above the battle whether of blood and iron or of ideas .

		To ideas in general , indeed , his attitude is strictly aristocratic and has more than a trace of aristo - cratic insufficiency .

		This nonchalance constitutes a peril for Sir
Arthur	PERSON	: his commodity is not always , so to speak , Grade i ; a certain staleness emanates from it .

		Thus he can write of the Germans : '' It has been - the curse of
Germany	LOCATION	that , mistaking the human end of education and misconceiving what ` power ' means in the saying ` Knowledge is Power , ' she has strained herself to it beyond preparation of ancestry or manners . ''

		Or of the proprieties : '' In ordinary social life we know that a well-bred man naturally inclines to let his ancestry -LRB- or his rank ; or his riches , if he have them ; or any personal dis - tinction he has won -RRB- go silently for granted ; not undervaluing them , but taught to see them in their true value as gifts at the best held in trusteeship from the gods . ''

		A countryman of
Edward Car	ORGANIZATION	- penter and
Havelock Ellis	PERSON	, he can write of
Hardy	LOCATION	's grim challenge to the stupidities and brutalities of sex , of the pitiful agonizing of Tess : '' Say what you will , this indignation in
Hardy	LOCATION	is noble , is chivalrous , and , as the world is worked , it has much reason at the back of its furious ` Why ?

		- Why ?

		- Why ? ' ''

		Instances might be multiplied -LRB- especially the Victorian stuffiness of a paragraph in the essay on Arnold that eluded his critical censor -RRB- , but the most serious inadequacy shows itself in his treat - ment of the war and that `` sacred emotion , love of one 's country . ''

		As for the war itself , there is something like an implication that it was owing to a lack of good form in the German nation `` that itch for self-assertion which is the root-bane of good manners . ''

		As for patriotism , it is obvious to him that the English in common with `` great nations of the past '' take it in the definitely right way with a trace of shyness .

		Sir
Arthur	PERSON	is de - fending the Socrates of the Menexenus against any possible suspicion of a taint of disloyalty .

		Socrates -LRB- or Plato for him -RRB- is dealing with the patrioteers of his day in quite the disillusioned modern spirit , and being at home with irony and , anyway , none too respectable he leaves it to his friendly com - mentators to delimit , or denature , his satire and supply the protective gloss .

		Sir
Arthur	PERSON	's seems to me inimitable and a good note on which to close : If a man 's mind be accustomed , as
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's was , to move reverently among holy things and so that his appreciation of them has become a second nature , he can afford -LRB- whether he speak of poetry , or of art , or of religion -RRB- to play with his adored one even as a tactful lover may tease his mistress , and the pair of them find in it a pretty refreshment of love .

		For he knows exactly where to stop , as she what to allow .

		... It may seem a long way even a longer way than to
Tipperary	LOCATION	from the polite irony of Menexenus to the cheerful irony of the English private soldier , now fighting for us on the Belgian border .

		But I suggest to you that his irony too plays with patriot - ism just because he is at home with that holy spirit ; so much at home that he may be called at any hour of the , day or night to die for it .

		Precisely because he lives in this intimacy , he is shy of revealing it , and from shy turns to scornful when the glib uninitiate would vulgarize the mystery .

		You see what it is to take life on the wing or disinter it from the slime and blood and filth of a trench in
Flanders	LOCATION	and turn it into the noble im - mobility of Art .

		Pygmalion 's feat was nothing beside it , really .

		GEORGE
DONLIN	ORGANIZATION	.

		284 THE DIAL
March 22	DATE	English Opportunism and the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	J.HE ROMANCE OF A LEAGUE of nations is gone .

		We now face cold realities a definite though com - plex scheme of international management , obscure with the detail of governmental mechanics , and re - vealing all the uncertainties that arise when ideas are put into the confines of print .

		The age of the Declaration of Independence is past ; we are in the era of the Federalist .

		The conflict as to the theories of political control is now definite and sharp .

		The great debate has begun .

		Already we hear com - plaints , first feeble but now harsh , that the scheme of a league of nations was made in
England	LOCATION	, and , if adopted , will be a triumph of English govern - mental theories .

		The playboy of the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	petu - lant Senator
Borah	PERSON	who first heartened us by his vigorous Liberalism and now has lapsed into the absurdities of abounding egotism , grounds his op - position to the
League	ORGANIZATION	chiefly on that complaint .

		And it must be admitted that the League of Na - tions in spirit , in theory , and in mechanics is Eng - lish ; that it stands as a masterpiece of English op - portunism and must be considered as the full flow - ering of the principles of the British Empire .

		The mere fact that
General Smuts	ORGANIZATION	, or some other Eng - lishman , anticipated or suggested much of the mechanics of the
League	ORGANIZATION	is of little significance ; the controlling fact is that the spirit and attitude of mind toward the problems of government of the whole plan is British .

		Is that a reason for rejecting the plan ?

		On the contrary is it not a reason for scrut - inizing the theory of English governmental oppor - tunism fairly and frankly ?

		Unhappily most of us know little about the Eng - lish
Empire	ORGANIZATION	except a few prejudiced generalities .

		The interesting and admirable sketch of the Eng - lish Empire by Professor
Edward Jenks	PERSON	-LRB- The Gov - ernment of the British Empire Little ,
Brown	PERSON	;
$ 2	MONEY	-RRB- , comes at an opportune time .

		Though Professor
Jenks	PERSON	modestly disclaims any higher purpose for his brief book than the furnishing of an introduction to the longer and more erudite texts , nevertheless his work , both in terseness and lucidity , not to speak of keenness of analysis , is not outshone by the learned books with which it competes .

		Indeed , it is more illuminating than any recent treatment of the English government except President
Lowell	PERSON	's enduring masterpiece .

		On finishing Pro- fessor
Jenks	PERSON	' discussion of the English Empire one is reminded of
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	's familiar epigram about the
Holy Roman Empire	ORGANIZATION	, that '' it was neither an empire , nor Roman , nor holy . ''

		The English Empire appears far indeed from imperial ; it seems a chaos of inconsistencies and intangible mannerisms of government .

		The elements of the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	seem all to do as they please ^ to demand diametrically opposite things ; and yet the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	stands firm as
Gibraltar	LOCATION	.

		As Professor
Jenks	PERSON	says , `` to many critics such a system appears to be sheer political lunacy ; but the results challenge a compari - son which probably causes a good deal of envy to mingle with their contempt . ''

		And what is far more perplexing , the whole system of the English Empire , to the pessimist , may well seem on the point of collapsing .

		What part shall the self-governing dominions play in imperial policies ?

		What of
India	LOCATION	or
Ireland	LOCATION	?

		Can there be an Empire if .

		Hughes of
Australia	LOCATION	defies the head of the English Empire ?

		The Empire has been postponing the much talked of Imperial Constitutional Conference until the end of the war , and is now confronted by a task second only in difficulty to that of a league of nations .

		And yet the English Empire the entire Empire includ - ing
India	LOCATION	and
Egypt	LOCATION	has undergone the terrific strain of the war , when the very existence of Eng - land trembled over the abyss , without even a visible crack .


England 's Empire	ORGANIZATION	, in its enduring strength , can not be scoffed at ; rather , indeed , it is to be envied .

		What is the underlying principle of ` this perplex - ing though admirable structure ?

		Opportunism sheer opportunism .

		Unfortunately the theory of op - portunism `` is credited with sinister , insecure attri - butes that it does not deserve .

		To be elementary , without desiring to imitate the formalism and austere blindness of academic discussions , we can distinguish two theories or basic attitudes of mind in government .

		The one is French and to a cer - tain extent American the insistence upon definite - ness .

		It is not so much that our Constitution is written and the English Constitution unwritten , but rather that the
American Constitution	ORGANIZATION	is definite , rigid , and complete , representing an ideal which must be vigorously adhered to in order to avoid de - struction , while the English Constitution has always consisted of indefinite traditions , representing a minimum of governmental principles and an odd de - termination never to solve an imperial question un - til the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	found the knife at its throat .

		The makers of our Constitution determined to set down a clearly defined code of government , and to pro- vide for every aspect of governmental conflict .

		They made one or two serious omissions take , for ex - ample , the assumed powers of
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	to declare legislative acts considered inharmonious with the Constitution void but their purpose was clear .

		The whole scope of American Constitutional history from
1789	DATE	until
1860	DATE	indeed , even to the
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 285 present day has represented a tendency to break away from the rigid maximum requirements of the Constitution , offset by a valiant determination not to add to the Constitution but to keep it intact .

		The American Constitution has been a glorious success , and the fact that it has succeeded so gloriously must move us all , as it did
Gladstone	PERSON	, to admiration .

		But it is extremely doubtful if the success could be re - peated in so infinite a field as international politics .

		Greater flexibility is needed .

		The English Constitu - tion is so flexible that at times it seems flabby .

		When problems arise the English improvise governmental conferences or devices to handle them but never before the problems arise .

		Somehow one gets the impression that in government as in the war the English blundered along in a hand-to-mouth way with brilliant success .

		They always have sufficient governmental mechanics to solve existing problems and to maintain the status quo ; they always have been struggling with a mass of dead governmental institutions which they never discard until these in - stitutions fall completely to pieces but they leave to the statesmen of the next day the problems of that day .

		Thus the English governmental structure , including the English parliamentary system , stag - gering under the burden of many small parties as distinct from the old government party and opposi - tion which erected it , is the world 's patchwork masterpiece .

		It is confused and lacks definite , log - ical arrangement ; yet it is flexible , workable , and sound .

		It is universally laughed at but universally imitated .

		It bristles with problems , yet it stands firm .

		It is frank opportunism , but not the oppor - tunism of indecision or feebleness ; rather it is the opportunism of practical statesmanship and of quiet confidence in the capacity of the coming generations .

		Your English statesman goes on the theory of never waking sleeping dogs ; they may die in their sleep .

		Now the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	, when carefully analyzed , reveals the same attitude of mind as found in the British Empire .

		It represents a minimum structure ; it solves only the problems it must solve in order to exist ; it is indefinite , uncertain , and leaves to the next generation the problems of the future .

		It may expand indeed it must to be fully successful ; it may grow more robust and acquire more definite , wider powers .

		Surely it can not grow any weaker and surrender any powers that it has without collapsing .

		It is a workable though vague compromise , indistinct and by no means balanced or symmetrical , but above all else it is workable easily and at once .

		In a word , it is an admirable achievement of the philosophy of opportunism .

		For that reason it will be difficult for us Americans fully to grasp and accept this new constitution .

		We Amer - icans , after all , are still a little provincial ; we love to gaze at our own picture reflected in the mirror of American tradition .

		We are being engulfed for the first time in the mist of European perplexities ; we still are strangers in a confused , new world .

		Like the French , we yearn for a complete , definite system of government covering every possible con - tingency ; thus the English opportunism of the
League	ORGANIZATION	will strike some of us as an intellectual af - front .

		President
Butler	PERSON	is reported so to have viewed it .

		But is it not true that the task confronting the world is so titanic that it can be achieved only by means of the English theory of doing as little in governmental devising as you can and of leaving to tomorrow the governmental problems thereof ?

		A fleeting analysis of the constitution reveals the full sway of this theory of English opportunism .

		Those who drafted the constitution strove to ar - range for the maintenance of the status quo to be established by the treaty of peace , to establish a minimum of international authority to handle likely difficulties , and to leave for the future all the prob - lems that can possibly be avoided .

		Thus the philos - ophers who are setting themselves up as international lawyers and sages in governmental theory are dis - mayed but not speechless .

		The constitution of the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	falls into three divisions : first , the sphere of power granted to the
League	ORGANIZATION	to prevent war ; second , the sphere of power granted to the League touching upon certain international problems which involve war only indirectly , such as labor and colonial ad - ministration ; third , the mechanics of government by which the two previous undertakings are to be accomplished .

		The question of preventing war the first and vital division suggested involves as a preliminary the problem of disarmament ; then , first , the prob - lem of making certain that no war will be begun un - til the masses ; of the people have had time to ascer - tain the issues involved and manifest their desires and until the possibilities of arbitration are ex - hausted ; then , second , and here is the basic distinc - tion , the problem of providing that if a dispute , jus - ticiable or not , is determined by the
League	ORGANIZATION	, or its arbitrators , in favor of the existing status , the status will be maintained by force of arms ; and third , the problem of providing for the enforcement of the
League	ORGANIZATION	's decision where a change in the existing status is involved in that decision .

		This distinction between the second and third problems may seem obscure and technical but it reaches the pith of the problem involved in the power of the League to pre - vent war .

		Let us , for purposes of illustration , con - sider a possible dispute between , say ,
Italy	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	over the control of
Tripoli	LOCATION	.

		First , assum - ing that the question of armament has already been 28-6
March 22	DATE	taken care of , the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	will insist upon the dispute being submitted to arbitration though both nations may not consider it justiciable .


Italy	LOCATION	controls
Tripoli	LOCATION	today ;
France	LOCATION	, let us assume , claims a wider field of influence .

		If the
League	ORGANIZATION	determines that
Italy	LOCATION	is in the right , since
Italy	LOCATION	already has
Tripoli	ORGANIZATION	, it means that the status quo is maintained .

		Thus we have involved our second problem the maintenance of the status quo .

		If the
League	ORGANIZATION	determines that
France	LOCATION	is right , the decision then requires that
Italy	LOCATION	be limited in her already com - plete control of
Tripoli	LOCATION	and that the status quo be changed .

		We then have the third problem .

		The constitution adequately provides for effective arbitration thus we can dismiss the first problem .

		The constitution also provides articles twelve and sixteen that where a member nation complies with the award , war can not be declared against it .

		In other words , if the award approves the status quo the successful nation can obviously comply with it , and any nation protesting against this status quo can not , without declaring war against the entire League , disturb the successful nation .

		In our ex - ample , if
Italy	LOCATION	is successful and the League de - termines that the status quo as to
Tripoli	LOCATION	is just ,
France	LOCATION	can not attack
Italy	LOCATION	or seize
Tripoli	LOCATION	with - out waging war against the entire League .

		Thus the second question , that of maintaining the status quo , is fully taken care of .

		On the other hand , if the
League	ORGANIZATION	determines that
France	LOCATION	should have greater power in
Tripoli	LOCATION	, then , unless the executive council is unanimous ,
France	LOCATION	must wage her own war against
Italy	LOCATION	unaided .

		Since it is extremely dif - ficult to imagine a dangerous dispute where one of the big five powers is not directly concerned , unani - mous consent by the executive council is extremely unlikely .

		Thus the third problem is left for the future to solve .

		What does all this mean ?

		Simply that the powers are anxious to establish a fixed order , to maintain it , and to leave to tomorrow the problems that may then arise .

		This desire is enforced by the guaranty of territorial and political integrity found in article ten .

		The nations of tomorrow can worry about this third problem of establishing justice by upsetting the status quo if they must .

		The question of disarmament is handled in the same manner .

		It is impossible to get the nations to concede to the League the power to fix armaments .

		Our
Senate	ORGANIZATION	will not ;
England	LOCATION	will not surrender her control of the sea .

		So the twenty-six articles provide that the executive council first suggests to the various nations a maximum armament which , when accepted by the various nations , establishes the status quo , any departure from which will mean war .

		Here again we have practical statecraft .

		Reach a status quo as easily as you can ; then adhere to it ; if the status quo can be changed peacefully that is with the consent of all the great nations all is well ; if it can not , let that be solved .

		by the genera - tions that must confront the problem .

		By that time the spirit of the League will be so much stronger that it can better grapple with the difficulty .

		The problem of today is to get some sort of recognition for the idea of a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	a workable scheme that can be expanded and twisted as the needs of the present demand .

		Thus we have a com - plete adoption of the underlying principle of the English Empire .

		There is a similar indefiniteness , a similar effort to find a workable minimum , in the other divisions of the constitution .

		So far as the scope of powers in international matters not directly concerning war is concerned , with the exception of the colonial ques - tion , scarcely a beginning is made .

		The right of the League to investigate such matters as the needs of labor is recognized .

		What that investigation will result in , let the future decide .

		So too , the much discussed system of mandatories is an adapta - tion of the ordered confusion of the English Em - pire with its graduated degrees of self-government self-governing dominions ,
India	LOCATION	, crown colonies divided into three groups with diminishing degrees of autonomy , protectorates like
Egypt	LOCATION	, chartered companies , and spheres of influence .

		In a word , it means the facile establishment of a status quo with ' a free road for change and improvement .

		The mechanics of government the third division is likewise indistinct enough to admit of the shap - ing influence of experience and conflict .

		It is in - teresting to remember , when we consider the frank indefiniteness of this part of the new constitution , that , as Professor
Jenks	PERSON	points out , when it was decided to introduce '' responsible government '' the very heart of the English theory of representa - tive government into the Australian constitutions it was found impossible to draw any article ade - quately covering the situation .

		A formal provision about the appointment of ministers was finally in - serted and the whole matter left to custom and practice .

		So the indefiniteness of the new constitu - tion need cause us no alarm .

		At first glance the division of powers between delegates and executive council is extremely obscure ; several powers are vested in the
League	ORGANIZATION	without any indication as to whether the general residuary power lies in the dele - gates or the executive council .

		But that will all be worked out in practice in the most convenient , feasible way .

		In government , time is the best con - stitution maker and experience the wisest drafting committee .

		A constitution for a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	might be drawn with all the formal , verbal stiffness igig THE DIAL 287 so urgently demanded by that apostle of stiffness in speech , ideals , and politics , Senator Lodge but such a constitution would hold the promise of con - fusion and conflict rather than clearness and cer - tainty .

		How can you have textual certainty and clearness when our very ideas as to the nature of a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	are still unsettled ?

		Only time and experience can clarify both our ideas and our phraseology .

		Such is the doctrine of English opportunism in government entrust as much as you can to time and experience ; the future is to be trusted not dreaded ; we are not the dictators of posterity .

		Surely when we consider the great chaos before us and the overwhelming necessity of some sort of in - ternational unity that will make it possible for humanity to survive , we can find solace and hope in the enduring success of English opportunism .

		A Second Imaginary Conversation
GOSSE	PERSON	AND MOORE I M. .

		Mr.
George Moore	PERSON	.

		GOSSE .

		My dear
Moore	PERSON	, how unexpected and how delightful .

		MOORE .

		It is pleasant to hear you say so , for truth to tell I was not quite sure that I showJd be welcome on a day not set apart for visitors .

		But since I am so fortunate I will admit that I am glad to catch you in your wont , passing your time on your great balcony , as large as a parlor , reading , a shawl wrapped about your knees .

		GOSSE .

		You know the proverb , '' Whether May come early or late , 't is sure to make the old cow quake . ''

		MOORE .

		I like these homely proverbs , and as I can not be among our lanes and downs I come to
Regent	ORGANIZATION	's Park , so typical of the
London	LOCATION	of our gen - eration , and to your house , typical of our ideas .

		All the way up the stairs it breathes the delightful seventies
Rossetti	PERSON	,
Madox Brown	PERSON	, and the residue .

		You were associated with the pre-Raphael - ites .

		GOSSE .

		Only through
Rossetti	PERSON	and
Swinburne	PERSON	's poems ; but my wife was a painter and knew them all , even that remote one who died last year .

		MOORE .

		And before you met the pre-Raphaelite movement you were a
Plymouth	LOCATION	Brother , another instinct of the English mind .

		I would be as English as you ,
Gosse	PERSON	, but to be you , I should have to re - nounce a great deal the
Nouvelle Athenes	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was in one of my adventures from that cafe to
London	LOCATION	that I brought my youthful drama in blank verse ,
Martin Luther	PERSON	, to a house overlooking a canal , with a screen of poplar trees between it and the barges .

		But
Delamere Terrace	ORGANIZATION	is almost forgotten , and I can only think of you here in
Regent	ORGANIZATION	's Park , though my instinct tells me that it was not you , but your wife and daughters , who discovered this Georgian house ; a man of letters does not make discoveries in house property .

		You owe a great deal to your wife and daughters .

		You will never know how much unless you survive them , which but the conversa - tion has taken a turn too gloomy for this wide bal - cony overlooking the Park .

		Did you notice that breeze , lilac laden ?

		And in a few days it will bring the odor of hawthorn .

		But what book are you read - ing ?

		GOSSE .

		Lamb 's Essays .

		MOORE .

		You knew them always , but Lamb was no more than a name to me until I found his book in my secretary 's hand and took it from her , and could do no writing that morning .

		GOSSE .

		So you mentioned once before , but despite your admiration you did not pursue your new ac - quaintance into his correspondence , as I begged you to do .

		MOORE .

		We must allow many good dishes to pass by if we would taste of a few fully .

		GOSSE .

		A frail excuse .

		MOORE .

		A second is not lacking .

		I would not risk blurring the impression the essays have made ; you tell me the correspondence will but increase it .

		But there is no need at present , for did I not say to myself , and not later tharLyesterday : '' No litera - ture has a Lamb like ours , not even Greek ... Not till it became canine . ''

		You do not understand ?

		You should , for the variant is
Swinburne	LOCATION	, ` with an additional turn given to it .

		What , not yet ?

		Is there not a lamb in the New Testament ?

		Ah !

		Now you 've got it , and we can return to Lamb who appears in your history as the author of a pastoral ,
Rosamond Grey	PERSON	.

		This work came upon me with something of a shock , and I am still trying to asso - ciate him with
Corydon	LOCATION	, Amaryllis ,
Sylvander	PERSON	, and
Rosalind	PERSON	, trying to see him among the downs , but 288 THE DIAL
March 22	DATE	in my imagination he remains always in
Fountain Court	ORGANIZATION	.

		You would have done well to have held your tongue about that pastoral .

		But his associa - tion , however brief it may have been , with shep - herds and sheep , brings us back easily to our own sheep , or , to be still more exact , my dear
Gosse	PERSON	, to your own '' yoe '' lamb that English genius ex - pressed itself so fully in poetry that very little was left over to sustain and dignify the other arts ... It would have cost
Stevenson	PERSON	a sleepless night had he heard you say so , for though he longed to write romance , he knew his own powers better than
Sid	PERSON	-
ney Colvin	PERSON	, and often let the secret out that they deserted him on the approach of human passions and emotions .

		Our bodies are as curiously constructed as our minds .

		Dr.
Pollock	PERSON	told me he once had a patient who could not take laudanum , however small the dose , and that he instructed his locum tenens not to give this one any , however great her suffering .

		But the locum tenens thought that an infinitesimal dose could not do as much harm as another sleepless night , and nearly killed her .

		He told me of a still stranger case of a patient whom mutton affected almost as a poison .

		It made her so ill when she was a child that she never ate it again , not for many years ; but rinding herself in a house where there was nothing but mutton for dinner , she ate a small portion , thinking her stomach 's revolt against the meat must have passed away with measles and whooping-cough .

		But it had n't , and Dr.
Pol	PERSON	- lock said that if she had died the microscope would have discovered nothing .

		So we find the physical world as incomprehensible as the intellectual .

		I have pondered on
Stevenson	PERSON	's failure to write stories , and have discovered very little more than the micro - scope merely that
Stevenson	PERSON	had all the literary gifts , and that one drop of story poisoned the lump .

		GOSSE .

		I think I can tell you why he failed to write stories ; he had little power to heighten the interest with anecdotes , and ...
MOORE	PERSON	.

		A very good point that is of yours ,
Gosse	PERSON	, better perhaps than you think , for the real gift of the tale-teller lies in the power to excite and illuminate by means of anecdote .

		Balzac ...
GOSSE	PERSON	.

		Balzac 's invention was always prompt .

		But I was going to give another reason for the dry - ness of
Stevenson	PERSON	's stories , the absence of his own en - chanting presence from them , one that I shall never forget , else I should have stopped you before , for if you do not propose to carry this discussion into our own time I think we had better turn our atten - tion to Disraeli and
Lytton	LOCATION	.

		MOORE .

		Lytton 's novels were among the first I read , and The Last of the Barons came to me highly recommended by my companions in whooping-cough in a school in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		As you may remember , whooping-cough allows nothing to stay on the stomach ; one is obliged to fly from the room con - stantly , and every time I returned I came upon peo - ple and events in the story that I could not connect with those I had left a few moments before .

		But my companions had said it was a great story , and I read on day after day , understanding nothing of what I was reading , dreading questions and expect - ing them , for it had begun to seem to me that I was being watched . ''

		So you 've finished the book ? ''

		said one .

		`` Did you enjoy the story ? ''

		`` Very much , '' I replied . ''

		Which part did you like the best ? ''

		another asked . ''

		It was all very good , '' I answered ; and all that day the laughers did not cease to tease me -LRB- how little the word '' tease '' expresses the agony those pin-pricks caused , so soft , so tender , so susceptible to pain are we in childhood -RRB- till , wearied of teasing , maybe , or thinking my skin had hardened and could be pierced no longer , they be - came curious to hear how I would take the news that every time I left the room my marker was ad - vanced some twenty or thirty pages .

		The Last Days of
Pompeii	LOCATION	was read in more favorable circumstances , and counted in my life as an educational influence , for it aroused my imagina - tion , and I ca n't help thinking that nothing really happens until the imagination is captured .

		In The Last Days of
Pompeii	LOCATION	there is one called Glaucus , who loves a blind girl and behaves towards her decorously .

		But it is to
Pelham	LOCATION	that I owe a cer - tain whimsicality of mind that the years have never rubbed away ; I believe the tone of the book has in - fluenced thousands .

		One incident is potent .

		Pel - ham is walking one day with a friend who begs him suddenly to cross the roadway , saying he can not bring himself to speak to or even to recognize as an acquaintance a man whom he had just caught sight of coming towards them .

		On looking up to see who it is that causes such an aversion ,
Pelham	ORGANIZATION	sees a man that everybody in
London	LOCATION	would like to be seen talking to . ''

		Why do you not wish to speak , to him ? ''

		Pelham asks ; and as soon as they are safely on the other side of the street the friend an - swers : '' The man you see coming towards us dined with me last week , and on my apologizing to him for an unaccountable oversight on the part of my cook , who substituted ordinary vinegar for chili with the turbot , replied that he did not know the difference between one vinegar and another .

		I feel that I have missed the end of
Lytton	LOCATION	's sentence , but the beginning you can take as being quoted correctly .

		But why should blame fall on the cook ?

		Pelham 's friend should have apologized for his butler 's mis - take ; turbot is not boiled in vinegar , and the pas - sage exhibits
Lytton	LOCATION	as a sciolist rather than as an adept in the art of living , a man of letters aping a THE DIAL 289 man of fashion , and doing it fairly well , but only fairly .

		At fifteen one overlooks detail , and Pel - ham 's friend was clearly one to be imitated .

		GOSSE .

		An exemplar that , methinks , has found many noisy adherents in our own time , every one of whom would be hurt and shocked to find himself traced to such an humble origin as
Lytton	LOCATION	.

		MOORE .

		But are not all origins humble ?

		We all begin in bad taste , and most men remain in it .

		GOSSE .

		Nobody had greater successes with the public than
Lytton	LOCATION	.

		Every book he wrote was a suc - cess ; some , of course , were more successful than others , but all were successes .

		MOORE .

		Another book of his roused my imagina - tion , and in much the same way as
Pelham	ORGANIZATION	The Parisians .

		It was never finished ;
Lytton	ORGANIZATION	's death in - terrupted the story as a party of friends in the beleaguered city were about to dine off a pet dog , Fox , whose master endured hunger as long as he could , sharing his crusts with Fox , but at last it be - came apparent that if Fox were not eaten at once he would not be worth eating later .

		GOSSE .

		Was Fox killed before the story stopped ?

		MOORE .

		I 've forgotten ; but the meal was not described , and
Lytton	ORGANIZATION	's description of it would have been worth reading ; his talent revealed itself in such scenes of comedy rather than in discourses on truth and beauty .

		Another great event of my youth , and of yours too ,
Gosse	PERSON	, I 'm sure , was Money , at the Old Prince of
Wales	LOCATION	's Theater , when the
Baa	ORGANIZATION	- crofts owned it .

		Do you remember
Coghlan	PERSON	and
Miss Foote	PERSON	in the act in which the will is read ?

		as good an act of comedy as ever was written if it resembles my memory of it .

		If you have forgotten it I never shall , nor a certain short front scene played by
George Honey	ORGANIZATION	and his wife .

		The The - ater never interested you ; but there was a Lamb in me , and if I had been taken round after a per - formance of Money and introduced to Lytton I should have fallen on my knees .

		GOSSE .

		Then it 's lucky you were n't , for the memory would have been disagreeable .

		Have you no memory of Disraeli ?

		MOORE .

		None .

		My father asked me to read
Vivian Grey	PERSON	, but it left no impression on my mind , perhaps because he asked me to read it ; and my memory of the unendurable silliness of
Henrietta Temple	ORGANIZATION	prevented me from reading
Lothair	PERSON	, though there were many in the Nouvelle Athenes who wished to hear what I thought of the book .

		There are so many wonderful books to read , I answered
Villiers Villiers de 1 ` Ile Adam	ORGANIZATION	. '

		. '

		Are there ? ''

		his troubled eyes seemed to ask , and I added '' there is your ' Eve . ' '' ''

		La nouvelle edition est epuisee , on m ' a dit hier de passer a la caisse .

		Enfin , si apres tout la chance est venue a moi ; '' and sweeping a lock of hair from his face he repeated , '' si apres tout la chance est venue a moi . ''

		Villiers ' unhappy eyes haunt me as none others do , and the memory of them is very dear to me .

		You have similar memories ,
Gosse	PERSON	.

		You remember the great men you met in s
Denmark	LOCATION	and
Norway	LOCATION	.

		The poet w r arns us to gather our memories while we may ; he should have added , '' for the time will come when memories will - seem like hips and haws , hardly worth gathering . ''

		The feminine trouble is the first to disappear ; we are glad in our folly , and afterwards regret it , for we are now altogether without appointments except those we make with our publishers ; a forlorn twain surely , having read too ` much and seen too many pictures , and though the world 's shows amuse us still we are weary of them and perhaps a little of ourselves .

		GOSSE .

		If you are a little weary of yourself it is because you have lost the habit of reading ; if you read it is to get something from the book , rather than for the book itself ; and if I may hazard a very personal criticism of your life I should say that you never cared for painting or music or literature , but used them as a means of self-development .

		MOORE .

		Even though what you say be true , am I different from anybody else ?

		Can we care for anything except as we care for food and drink ?

		But I agree with you ,
Gosse	PERSON	, in this much , that I have invested too much in art .

		You have been wiser or more fortunate in the conduct of your life .

		You do not stand alone ; there are your wife , your daugh - ters , your son , and little grandchild .

		This solid Georgian house is charged with memories of your life and theirs .

		You have nothing to complain of ,
Gosse	PERSON	; a very fortunate man you have been in your literature , in your wife and children .

		The
House of Lords	ORGANIZATION	fell into your lap at the right moment when you began to tire of writing articles for necessary money .

		And with the
House of Lords	ORGANIZATION	came other windfalls .

		Indeed the only ill luck that I can re - member is when the age limit obliged you to leave the Lords .

		Even that retirement was not an un - mixed bitterness , for it did not come before you left behind you a permanent memory .

		You are still the literary force behind the
House	ORGANIZATION	.

		It has begun to write , and every lord that writes is your debtor for an article .

		And so are we ,
Gosse	PERSON	.

		We too are indebted to the lords for many pages ` of pure , beautiful English prose ; if not music makers them - selves , the lords are at least the reeds through which music is blown .

		GOSSE .

		It is indeed a pleasure to me to hear that my prose has pleased you .

		But you do not think that I write these articles merely because the books I review were written by lords ?

		MOORE .

		Good heavens ,
Gosse	PERSON	, such a thought 290 THE DIAL
March 22	DATE	never crossed my mind .

		Who could defend the lords as well as their old librarian ?

		Who should defend them if he refrained ?

		Who has a right to defend them better than he ?

		GOSSE .

		I never put it to myself in that way be - fore , but I see now that I must have always felt that their old librarian still owed them his service .

		MOORE .

		Service does not comprehend the whole of your sympathy .

		You look back on the
House of Lords	ORGANIZATION	as I do on the
Nouvelle Athenes	LOCATION	; on stepping over the two thresholds we seemed to step into our true selves , at least I did and you can judge if I am not today as distinctly un-Nouvel Athenian as I was when I brought you
Martin Luther	ORGANIZATION	.

		GOSSE .

		It is nice of you to speak like this , for sometimes it has crossed my mind that my attitude to the Lords might be misunderstood .

		But you understand me so well that perhaps others too under - stand better than I thought for .

		MOORE .

		Thank you ,
Gosse	PERSON	, I do not think that * anyone seriously misunderstands , but it may be that my almost excessive interest in human conduct has enabled me to see farther into the lives of others than the average man .

		GOSSE .

		As we are on the subject I may say to you that my connection with the
House of Lords	ORGANIZATION	has been useful in many ways that perhaps you do not know of .

		It has opened up libraries to me that I should never have seen , certainly never have known in detail if I had not been privileged .

		It was only the other day I was staying at
Loughton Hall	ORGANIZATION	.

		The late Earl wrote some charming poetry ; you are not interested in the byways of literature , but I am ; and besides writing a good deal of poetry , which in my humble opinion is not without value , he was a great book collector .

		His libraries were among the richest in the
United Kingdom	LOCATION	; and if we were not engaged in a search for somebody that has written prose narrative in
England	LOCATION	seriously I could tell you of many interesting discoveries but , alas , in - stead of telling you of a sonnet ending on the lovely line '' Princess appoint me shepherd of your smiles , '' I must insist that we return to
Lytton	LOCATION	and Disraeli .

		In my History of English Literature you have given so many proofs of your attentive reading of my book that perhaps , you remember that I place Disraeli higher than
Lytton	LOCATION	; you , it would seem , take an opposite view ; but we will not waste words on our differences of opinion regarding the relative value of a mercenary literature , novels that served to pay the election expenses of their authors , and now exemplify your theory that the English novel was never anything more than a commercial trans - action between author and publisher .

		On this point we are in cordial agreement , and I will add that
Disraeli	PERSON	, knowing his literary talent was no more than a showy facility in the handling of words , an essentially Jewish talent , was glad to place the whole of it at the service of politics , whereas
Lytton	LOCATION	, be - lieving himself to be a great man of letters , gave ear to the tempter and sold , not his whole ^ soul , but half of it , which is always a bad speculation , for half a soul is of no use to God or man .

		MOORE .

		My faith is plighted to your psychology that every man writes as well as he can a mourn - ful truth indeed , for the rogue is more interesting that the dupe .

		This much , however , may be said in favor of
Lytton	LOCATION	and Disraeli that they succeed in amusing many more than we do , or ever shall .

		You have no doubt asked yourself very often if it were not better to amuse the multitude than to deserve the respect of the few : for all passes but
Shakespeare	PERSON	and the
Bible	LOCATION	, and we in our midnight communings ask ourselves if it be not better to range with humble livers in content than to seek the grand style , for whosoever seeks it is driven into suicide ; in
Haydon	LOCATION	's case it was towards a basin , with a razor in his hand .

		There is a potential
Benjamin Haydon	PERSON	in every one of us , minus the noble soul who found a
Calvary	ORGANIZATION	in Parnassus from the evening he went to Park Lane to consult the
Elgin Marbles	ORGANIZATION	for information regarding the drawing of a foot .

		GOSSE .

		I know nothing more heartbreaking than his description of his mother 's death nothing in
Balzac	LOCATION	, nothing in
Turgenev	LOCATION	, and it may be that a great man of letters was lost in a bad painter .

		MOORE .

		If he had laid aside the palette for the pen he would have sought the grand style in litera - ture .

		A noble soul despite his failure .

		* * * But what am I saying ?

		It Was through his failure that we learned to know him .

		You overlooked him , in your History ; worse still , you overlooked Borrow .

		GOSSE .

		As you say , I overlooked Borrow .

		Mea culpa , mea maxima culpa .

		MOORE .

		I 'm glad to hear that you repent an omission which is a grave one , but I must not take credit for unselfish reading ; my discovery was made while reading for information rather than for plea - sure .

		I had forgotten Borrow 's birth and death , and finding you had overlooked him , I had recourse to my friends and learned from them that Borrow was a contemporary of Scott .

		A century , at least , I said , should divide them , and I fell to thinking of Borrow writing The Bible in
Spain	LOCATION	, his eye always on the object , thinking only how he might discover every voice and aspect of
Spain	LOCATION	in English prose .

		Borrow is an integral part of my subject , I said , for now I come to consider it , like
Sterne	PERSON	, he saved his talent by refraining from story-telling .

		GOSSE .

		But he did write stories
Lavengro	PERSON	and
The Romany Rye	ORGANIZATION	.

		1919 THE DIAL 291
MOORE	PERSON	.

		These admirable books have always been looked upon as biographies , into which Borrow in - troduced many imaginary anecdotes ; and it seems worth while to point out that the strange mixture of fact and fiction , which has caused so much wonder - ment among his admirers , was imposed upon Borrow by the very nature of his talent too great to per - mit him to write a literature of oiled ringlets and perfumery , and not great enough to allow him to create outside of his own observation in other words , te evoke human souls out of instinctive knowledge how human life is made .

		GOSSE .

		We had an interesting talk on that sub - ject not very many days ago , you maintaining that
Serge Aksakoff	PERSON	was not the principal character , but
Serge	PERSON	's father , whereas I looked upon the narrator as the chief character .

		But I can see now that I was wrong , for
Serge	PERSON	does not attempt to narrate himself , like
Rousseau	PERSON	he is merely , the reed through which the music is blown .

		MOORE .

		We learn little or nothing of Borrow from his books , and remember them by the anec - dotes , all of which enfold sketches of men and women that set us thinking of
Daumier	PERSON	, many caught in eternal lines the old woman whom he found groaning over a straw fire in a ruined castle somewhere near
Clonmel	LOCATION	, and the man he met hunting hare with hound in the bog as he returns home .

		The hare stops in the middle of the road ; a few moments after the man and his hound ap - pear , and after some strange dialogue hound and hare and huntsman disappear in the dusk .

		No one tells an anecdote like Borrow , and the anecdotes he tells never fail to enhance the interest and compel the reader to continue reading .

		We must take off our hats when we read his telling of the fight with the Tinman , and the - chaste nights and days that follow in the dingle , Borrow in one tent and the
Tinman	ORGANIZATION	's daughter in another .

		An idea strikes me ,
Gosse	PERSON	, that Borrow is Defoe risen from the dead , and though God may forgive me , I can never forgive myself for not having thought of this before .

		But I see you are not thrilled , yet you can not have forgotten our little talk about
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	.

		I could not remember if Crusoe taught
Friday	DATE	his Catechism , and you told me he did .

		GOSSE .

		Borrow would probably have learnt Fri - day 's language and translated the Gospels into it .

		MOORE .

		I know no book that I would as soon read again as
The Bible	ORGANIZATION	in
Spain	LOCATION	.

		An imperishable book , for it is about people and things .

		Landscape after landscape ; and is there not somewhere in the book a dwarf who turns somersaults in front of Sorrow 's noble horse ?

		Or did I invent it ?

		I was grieved when he parted with his horse , and only fully soothed by the brilliant report of a conversa - tion with an Archbishop . ''

		You want permission to sell the Gospels without notes or commentaries ? ''

		the Archbishop asks .

		And Borrow admits that that is the permission he is applying for , but gathering from the Archbishop 's manner that the permission he seeks will not be granted , he observes the bishop 's ring , and a delightful little conversation springs up regarding the purity of the gem .

		A little later in the book we learn that beautiful souls can exist even in Catholicism , and though our lives were extended to a thousand years we should still re - member the Alcalde in the wild landscape of
Cape Finistere	LOCATION	.

		GOSSE .

		Of what are you thinking ?

		MOORE .

		If the admirer of
Jeremy Bentham	PERSON	was invented by Borrow or by nature .

		I beg your pardon ,
Gosse	PERSON	, for my absentmindedness ; it was only a moment ago that I was contrasting Borrow with
Defoe	PERSON	, and now I am thinking of him in con - nection with
Miss Austen	PERSON	, for whereas in Borrow sex is altogether absent , in
Miss Austen	LOCATION	it is omni - present .

		GOSSE .

		The omission of sex from Borrow 's work is no doubt very remarkable , and can not be ac - counted for by an unhappy marriage , for as far as we know Mrs. Borrow did not give him any cause for sorrow .

		MOORE .

		His books are stamped with an indif - ference to women .

		GOSSE .

		You think that Mrs. Borrow kept a close watch ?

		.

		MOORE .

		I was not thinking of Mrs. Borrow or even of Borrow .

		A casual thought crossed my mind that the best portraits of women are written by bachelors the celibate , I suppose , being more interested in sex than the married ; and now an - other thought has come to me : that it was Miss
Austen	PERSON	's spinsterhood that allowed her to discover the Venusberg in the modern drawing-room .

		GOSSE .

		I 'm afraid I miss your point .

		MOORE .

		We do not go into society for the pleas - ure of conversation , but for the pleasure of sex , direct or indirect .

		Everything is arranged for this end the dresses , the dances , the food , the wine , the music !

		Of this truth we are all conscious now ; but should we have discovered it without Miss
Austen	PERSON	's help ?

		It was certainly she who perceived it , and her books are permeated with it , just as
Wordsworth	PERSON	's poems are with a sense of deity in nature ; and is it not this deep instinctive knowl - edge that makes her drawing-rooms seem more real than anybody else 's ?

		We all remember the arrival of the young man for the dance in Pride and Prejudice .

		Nor has any of us forgotten how satur - ated with sex is the long walk in
Mansfield Park	LOCATION	, 2 < -RRB- 2 THE DIAL
March 22	DATE	and the more profoundly because of the formality of social speech observed ; the opening and shutting of a gate is the only event ; all the rest is sex the lady walking with her parasol aslant , the gentle - man beside her engaged in carrying on a trite con - versation that neither would have endured had it not been a sexual adventure .

		In Sense and
Sensi	PERSON	- bility there is much less restraint
Marianne	PERSON	is sex stricken as
Juliet	PERSON	was not , as Isolde was not ; and never in literature did anybody drink as deeply of the love philter as
Marianne	LOCATION	.

		Our wonder at her passion is heightened by the fact that it wears out in drawing-rooms among chaperons ; and the book falls on our knee , and we murmur as we look through the silence : How simple the means and how amaz - ing the result !

		A good deal of what I am saying here is repetition come over from our last conver - sation , provoked by Borrow , in whose books the drawing-room never appears .

		The knights ride past the Venusberg without seeing it , without hearing it , and we find ourselves in a workaday world of gipsies and prize-fighters , horse dealers and horse thieves , odds and oddments of all sorts and kinds .

		Borrow is never at a loss for a queer turn of mind , and the dealer in Chinese porcelain who is inspired by the writing on the cups and saucers to learn Chinese is never far from my thoughts .

		Another equally interesting anecdote eludes my memory for the moment .

		It will come back presently .

		In
Wild Wales	LOCATION	we are in a real country filled with real peo - ple , and Borrow enchants us with his talks with wayfarers as he walks through the hills , having con - veniently left his wife and daughter behind .

		His characters are as numerous as the people that come and go through the pages of the
Bible	LOCATION	.

		GOSSE .

		How he enjoys his beer , and how the quality of the beer fixes a certain picturesque site in his memory .

		Of the truth of this to nature I can vouch , for , having once wandered into
Wales	LOCATION	on foot for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of Borrow 's itinerary , what happened to Borrow happened to me .

		I , too , remember a certain town by the excellence of the glass of beer I drank in its inn .

		MOORE .

		What was the name of that
Welsh	ORGANIZATION	town ?

		GOSSE .

		It is unkind of you to ask me these ques - tions .

		You know that my unfortunate memory re - tains few names and dates above all , dates .

		But here is something you may not have thought of the almost Dutch seriousness which we notice in Borrow may have come to him from
Holland	LOCATION	.

		He was a
Norfolk	LOCATION	man , and
Norfolk	LOCATION	more than any - where else is impregnated with Dutch influence , especially during Borrow 's century .

		He was born in the eighteenth ; I should say he was a contem - porary of Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	, as your friends told you , and as your thesis , or a great part of it , is that literature written for money is worthless from an esthetic point of view , and from every point of view in a few years , I think that Borrow is the illustration you require .

		All his books , with one exception , were failures , commercial failures , with the exception of
The Bible	ORGANIZATION	in
Spain	LOCATION	, and it was not the literary merits of
The Bible	ORGANIZATION	in
Spain	LOCATION	that caused it to be read ; and if you care to emphasize your paradox that a man 's name directs the course of his life , you can say that
George Borrow	PERSON	is a name that would be approved by his admirers if his books had come to us anonymously .

		You will be safe in saying as much , for the name is plain , straightforward , without subterfuge or evasion , in perfect agreement with the man 's literary style and his wont .

		I can hear you call it an honest English name , one that began with the race , to endure for all time , like our homesteads , and so forth .

		You will be able to fill up the category of qualities that the name evokes better than
I. MOORE	PERSON	.

		He wrote a literature that pleased no - body when it was written , and he has outlived his contemporaries and predecessors , all except
Jane Austen	PERSON	, who , like him , wrote to please herself .

		Bor - row was a great master of patter -LRB- his patter is as good as
Jane Austen	PERSON	's -RRB- .

		The next time we meet in a country house we will read some Borrow to - gether ; you have no doubt a thousand interesting things to say to me about The Bible in
Spain	LOCATION	, and I am conscious of a desire springing in me to talk for an hour on the extraordinary variety of charac - ters and conversations in that great book ; but we must hasten from
Spain	LOCATION	to meet three sisters from a parsonage over against a
Yorkshire	LOCATION	heath whose literary fortunes draw into the arena of this dis - cussion an interesting question how far the cir - cumstances of an artist 's life contribute to get recog - nition for his work .

		Literature alone is unavail - ing ; however beautiful it may be it will remain unread if circumstances do not come to its aid something in the book itself or something in the author 's life .

		The Bible in
Spain	LOCATION	was read for the sake of the propaganda ; if it had been less well written it would probably have been still more widely read .

		We read it today for certain esthetic qualities , and
Byron	PERSON	, who preceded Borrow by forty or more years , was read for his title , his exile , and most of all for his romantic death in
Greece	LOCATION	.

GEORGE MOORE	PERSON	.

		1919 THE DIAL 2 93 Why Reform Is Futile I F WORKMEN PETITION employers or state legisla - tures for an eight-hour day , they may be deported or they may be jailed , but they are not hanged as they were thirty years ago in
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		Credit for this evidence of progress goes to the labor unions , as it should , but some generous recognition is also due those social reformers who have advocated state pro- tection for wage workers , and government control of financial operations as efficient and ethical principles of statecraft .

		These reformers for many years have given unremitting energy , in and out of legislatures , to campaigns which they have hoped would eventu - ally result in the adoption of a national policy of industrial reform by way of protective enactments .

		I speak of these reforms now because of the unex - pected opportunity we have been given to estimate the power of labor legislation to bring about change in our industrial habits and national manners .

		Good people in the early days of the factory system were shocked by the long hours of labor and the long absences from home which factory opera - tions required .

		Some time later practical men came to the rescue of the idealists as they pointed out that long hours of labor meant in the end the political and industrial inefficiency of the nation .

		Many years of reform campaign went by before the promoters were given a full hearing , because labor in spite of the wear and tear of factory life continued its flow to the satisfaction of business demands , which are con - cerned with the immediate situation and not tb , future of a people .

		But suddenly the valiant hopes of the reformers achieved an apparent glory of re - alization .

		The occasion came as a surprise because the cause of it had less to do with the development of events within the reform movement than with the misfortunes of the Republican party .

		It was es - timated by the recalcitrants of that party that the new party which they formed would stand its best chance of swinging into power if it adopted the labor legislative program of the reformers .

		Thou - sands of men and women with deep conviction as to the righteousness of their cause pledged the Proges - sive party their active support and gave it their vote .

		The popularity of the measures for which this party stood is not to be judged by the failure of the party to carry the election or to weather a second presidential campaign .

		The test of the popular sup - port must be estimated rather by the inability of the Democratic party to win any election if it rejected these measures .

		Furthermore , its leaders discovered later that their endorsement of state interference in industry and of privilege for the working man , op - posed as these measures were to traditional policies of the party , was not to end with election promises or the writing of platform planks .

		The full irony of the situation appeared when the Democratic ad - ministration representing the party in power was compelled during the war period to put into actual practice those reform measures and to extend their application beyond the anticipation of their advo - cates It was clear beyond dispute that the successful operation of the war industries could not be left to employers , and that labor must be placated .

		This delicate task the government was forced to take over and to take over with the assistance of the reformers who had their policy of state interference fully evolved .

		So far as I can remember every demand which the reformers had made during the preceding decade was echoed in the reorganization and the ex - tended activities of the
Department of Labor	ORGANIZATION	, as well as in the other departments , war councils , and com - mittees which were engaged in the production direct - ly and indirectly of war materials .

		I do not say that the ideals of the reformers were realized in any case , nor was there time for their full realization .

		My point is that all the measures which had been advocated were given official recognition , that labor reform administrators were appointed to deal with them , that an understanding was gained as to what the measures stood to accomplish .

		A system of federal employment exchanges was promoted , for which the reformers had for a long time contended , and the private agencies exterminated .

		A War La - bor
Board	ORGANIZATION	was created for the settlement of wage conditions by means of collective bargaining and arbitration .

		Special councils were organized to look after the special needs of women and young persons as well as the health and safety of all wage earners in the workshops .

		Provisions for the extension of sanitation to the homes of the workers were also made .

		There was added to the councils charged with the administration of the reform measures an - other council which was concerned with the formu - lation of a policy of government regulation and control of labor conditions .

		This wholesale extension of protection to labor was inaugurated for the pur - pose of war .

		Three months have elapsed since the signing of the armistice , and while there is still a trace of these reform agencies and some pale evidence of their continued activity , it must have become clear to the reformers themselves that their method of social reorganization will not materially alter the 294 THE DIAL
March 22	DATE	operation of the laws of the national economy which we have set up and which we support .

		The sudden collapse of the policy inaugurated at
Washington	LOCATION	was almost as spectacular a performance as was the official recognition which was given it in
1912	DATE	and
1917	DATE	- It is rumored that a revival of this war-time government machinery may be undertaken if unem - ployment and business stagnation lead to serious strikes and to business demands for increase of privilege and subsidy .

		But machinery set up for war will not serve peace because the driving force of the war machin - ery , which was war patriotism , represents an actual horsepower which business animus , the driving force of industry in times of peace , fails to induce .

		As the war came to a close and the wartime patriotism lost its force , so did the mandatory influence of the
War Labor Board	ORGANIZATION	.

		New wage boards may be created and special protection given business and labor `` for the transition period , '' but what reason is there to believe that these can be developed as a national policy ?

		or if they are , that they will change the relative posi - tion of capital and labor ?

		The actual accomplish - ment in legislative regulation of the hours of women workers in the
last decade	DATE	is as follows : in ten states women may work seventy hours or more ; in twenty-one states they may work anywhere from fifty-five hours to seventy ; and in fifteen states from fifty-five to forty-eight .

		In respect to the minimum wage there are twelve states out of the forty-eight which have given it their endorsement .

		But this lack of legislative accomplishment presents a less complete picture of the uphill character of the re - form movement than the persistent difficulties with which the movement is beset in the way of enforce - ment .

		And were it possible to overcome the difficulties of enactment and enforcement , labor would still have the bill to pay for the sick insurance it received , for its sanitary privileges , its increase in wages , and its decreased hours of work .

		An award in hours may be paid for in wages or the burden of an award in both hours and wages can be shifted through an increase in rents , food , or clothing , through labor saving devices which result in the decrease in the wage rate or in the annual wage income .

		There is often an appearance of economic gain for labor when an award is made by a state legislature or by a union but the net result is usually the avoid - ance of cost by vested interests without relative gain in labor 's position .

		The reformers in their desire to put the industrial situation to rights , have undertaken to accomplish their end by the indirect road of political action .

		They have done this because it was the only road open to them , as they are not a part of industry and can not function through it .

		If society were so organized that all the members of it were engaged in some productive occupation or creative work , the sole business of the government under these circumstances would be to open up every op - portunity for all the members to function to the limit of their capacity .

		As the situation is now , the re - form movement represents a policy of the unlimited extension of the government 's police function ; it rep - resents a method of negation and indirection .

		All economists , hard thinking business men , and wage earners know that the roots of the labor legis - lative reform movement are too tender to penetrate beyond the surface of our political and industrial institutions .

		To put this familiar matter once more , quite simply it is this : while natural wealth is with - out approximate limit , the sources of wealth by the act of the state become the private possession of men who can show credit for a financial equivalent .

		This credit is given not to those who can show productive ability but to those who have already received credit .

		The manipulation of this wealth which represents control over industrial enterprise is carried on first and naturally in the interest of the manipulators , the people who have been given and can give credit .

		These creditors assume , as they say , `` the steward - ship '' of all the national wealth which they receive , and by the law of the land it is theirs to do with as they please .

		The position of the reformers is anoma - lous as they invoke this same law for labor conces - sions .

		It is extremely embarrassing for the state to recognize the invocation , as it places it virtually in the position of '' Injun giver . ''

		The reformers are in position of suppliants who come with claims to what has already been disposed of .

		They do not ask for a return of the common wealth to labor , on the ground that access to wealth should be free and control over production extended to those who can prove their ability to carry forward the undertaking .

		And why should they ?

		Labor has shown no dispo - sition to undertake it .

		This indisposition of labor is in part the raison d'etre of the reformer .

		It is the story of the people who do not attend to their own affairs and of the other people who make an attempt to do it for them .

		It is the experience of the ages that such attention meets with indifferent results .

		It may be that the situation in which labor finds itself and which it is called upon to reshape , if it is to prove its capacity for self-government , is actually too difficult an environment for it to affect .

		This is the supposition of the reformers who argue that if labor had more leisure , say sixteen hours absence from work , and a living wage , it would be in a position to affect its environment .

		The facts hardly
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 2 95 bear out this argument .

		The present social environ - ment seems entirely safe in the hands of the count - less thousands of skilled mechanics , clerks , and su - perintendents , for instance , who live above the re - gion of the financially submerged worker .

		These skilled mechanics , clerks , and superintendents who enjoy a greater purchasing power show no greater disposition as a class of people to alter their indus - trial status than does the class of workers who are economically the most helpless .

		Although the eco - nomic position of individuals is in a constant state of change , it has not been possible for them to over - come the conditions of the environment as they are fixed .

		The established industrial institution is suc - cessfully maintained with its definite status for the workers .

		And this state of affairs is bound to con - tinue in spite of the interminable propaganda of re - formers and the intellectual expositions of the econo - mists , until the institution through some internal infirmity of its own gives way .

		Santayana has said '' the real difficulty in man 's estate , the true danger to his vitality , lies not in want of work but in so colossal a disproportion be - tween demand and opportunity that the ideal is stunned out of existence and perishes for want of hope .

		The life of reason is continually beaten back upon its animal sources , and nations are submerged in deluge after deluge of barbarism ... The ideal requires , then , that opportunities should be offered for realizing it through action , and that transition should be possible from a given state of things . ''

		I think history goes to show that progress has been made , not through any instinct or passion of a people for the abstraction of justice or democracy , but through the failure of the established institution to function .

		The truth of the matter , seems to be that the social environment in which the mass of men have found themselves from time to time has been too difficult for them to affect except at those propitious moments when the conditions which have inhibited action have broken down of their own weight .

		These times in the nature of the case seem destined to appear for the reason that the social en - vironment is a condition of interdependence of a people .

		As population changes or expands , as new relations evolve , interdependence and the fixed con - ditions of the old environment fail to meet the needs of the new .

		Never has the truth of this been so clearly demonstrated as now , because never has the interdependence of people been so widely extended .

		Our present industrial infirmity is due to the fail - ure of the institutional order to secure the coopera - tion of labor in the enterprise of wealth production .

		This failure is a sign that the interdependence of the productive factors has become a matter of conscious - ness .

		This has come about in part through the rest - lessness of the factors , through their increased move - ment and the interchange in the personnel of groups , but it is due primarily to the realization that the further promotion of industry is now actually de - pendent on an economy in the use of labor energy .

		The old scheme of business management can not sat - isfy the need for the economy or omit the necessity of turning that restlessness into active cooperation .

		It can not be met by the substitution this time of ma - chines for men .

		It must be met by the men themselves .

		Industry has become too vast a burden , as it is being extended , for its promoters to carry it forward against the disinclination of the mass of people involved .

		The industrial order is passing through a crisis as it is faced with new world conditions .

		Even the finan - ciers have some appreciation of the fact that the old habits and processes which have served them call for revision .

		Their production managers , expert in the industrial processes and the estimation of costs , have demonstrated that new methods of manufacture can be introduced which will effect a saving as great as that secured by the steam engine .

		The point in this discovery which is pertinent for all who are in - terested in industrial reorganization is that it pro- poses not a substitution of some other energy for human energy but a new distribution of the energy of labor .

		This new distribution can show not only an increase in output and a decrease in cost but a greater reduction in working hours than either reformers or trade unionists in their modesty or con - sideration here thought fit to demand .

		This discov - ery involves no capital investment or extra financial credit .

		It is entirely possible for labor in its organ - ized capacity to make it its own .

		It is possible for organized labor to agree to deliver the greater out - put which results from its own saving in workshop energy , and stipulate that on delivery its own saving of its own energy shall not be appropriated by others .

		The recognition of the need of labor 's cooperation in the new methods of industrial economy introduces the condition which makes possible the worker 's as - sumption of responsibility for the promotion of wealth .

		The recognition indeed creates an environ - ment which it is possible for labor to affect .

		Here we have the conditions of the new industrial psy - chology brought about by fundamental requirements in the social economy .

		The realization of these conditions will provide an environment in which in - dustrial democracy will have opportunity to develop .

		While the reformers ' program is without eco - nomic sanction according to the laws of our indus - trial institution as that is now run ; while it is with - out important material results for the workers ; 296 THE DIAL
March 22	DATE	while it tends to convert the government into a po - lice organization ; while it contributes nothing con - structive to the actual business of wealth production ; it has served a beneficial purpose as it has prevented upholders of our institutions from sinking into a hopeless state of smug satisfaction .

		It has induced a certain amount of the restlessness , much explana - tion and examination of industrial practice .

		More than this , while the reform movement represents a large expenditure of energy for small returns , waste activity is an inevitable condition of growth .

		The trial and error experience prevails even where reason and creative effort have had a chance .


HELEN MAROT	PERSON	.

		Cities and
Sea Coasts	ORGANIZATION	and Islands `` 1VT - L V JL AY THERE NOT BE superior beings amused with any graceful , though instinctive , attitude my mind may fall into , as I am entertained with the alertness of the stoat or the anxiety of a deer ? ''

		Keats asks in the letters .

		It is with this spirit that Mr.
Arthur Symons	PERSON	, in Cities and Seacoasts and Islands -LRB-
Brentano	LOCATION	;
$ 3	MONEY	-RRB- , approaches his places
Cordova	PERSON	,
Toledo	LOCATION	,
Valencia	LOCATION	,
Seville	LOCATION	, the convent of
Montserrat	LOCATION	,
London	LOCATION	,
Cornwall	LOCATION	, and
Dover	LOCATION	; it is in this way he takes his men and women in these cities and islands and sea towns .

		In all these papers known already , some of them , in periodicals he maintains his point of view .

		To him there is in the aspect we human beings present to one another some - thing inevitably automatic .

		In most men we see little more than a smile , a passing , a gesture ; they are hardly more real to us than actors on the stage .

		They are largely a spectacle to us , conveying a sense of beauty , variety , life , change , or necessity .

		Our pleasure and satisfaction over life and cities and men depend largely on the skill with which we have trained ourselves to an instinctive and delighted apprehension .

		Sometimes , and to a few , we can draw closer , and they seem more real to us .

		But for most we must be content to wonder , to a ` dmire , to see the use and beauty and curiosity of them , and so take them , without the wan endeavor of in - truding further into their meanings and destinies .

		The book is made up of the experience of the senses weaving back and forth into the experience of the colder intelligence .

		In writing of this sort the record of the senses solely may .

		become shape - less , emotional , lush .

		The record of the in - telligence solely becomes merely informative , unper - ceptive , workaday .

		But Mr.
Symons	PERSON	describes the yellow and white town climbing into the pale sky in
Cordova	LOCATION	; or in
Tarragona	LOCATION	the gray houses climbing to a yellow point the Cathedral ; he sees the shadows around things no longer gray as in colder lands , but blue '' de fac.on que les om - bres semblent eclaire d'un cote par le clair de lune et de 1 ` autre par le soleil , '' as
Gautier	PERSON	says ; or the river wild and savage , with the brown sand redden - ing under the dark clouds in
Valencia	LOCATION	; and we be - gin to realize and to share that happy and delighted apprehension of which he speaks and which is surely his .

		It is interesting to see such an observer achieve , through the utmost sophistication of thought and art and sense , results that are often as elemental as the emotion of the primitive life of which he speaks or of the founders of the ancient , far-off things that delight him .

		He achieves now and again a sort of direct elemental contact with light and color and life and naive creations , as the perfect athlete achieves the quality of the savage body .

		He en - joys the veracity of the flesh .

		He has himself that kind of subtlety which he observes in
Spain	LOCATION	, and which he adds to his own artistic and cosmopolitan range , that kind of secondary spiritual subtlety that comes from exquisitely responsive senses , a sort of delicacy that forms in itself a profound kind of in - telligence .

		He records at the
Montserrat Convent	ORGANIZATION	, perched on the rocks nearly three thousand feet above the ruddy soil of the encircling plain beneath , the sense he had of natural felicity moved to aston - ishment , to the - absoluteness of delight in being where one is , and the sense of being perfectly happy , with that element of strangeness in it all without which he can not conceive happiness .

		He notes in the women of
Seville	LOCATION	the mournful pallor , and that long , im - mobile gaze , which seems to touch the flesh like a slow caress ; the cold ardor , which is the utmost re - finement of fire ; a white people carrying themselves like idols .

		And in
Toledo	LOCATION	, before the paintings of
El Greco	PERSON	, he writes of the man 's contempt for the facile joys and fresh carnations of life , his desire to express another kind of world , to paint the life of continual proud meditation .

		Here is a man , he says , who has intellectualized the warmth of life into the specter of a thought taking visible form somewhat alarmingly .

		Gautier had seen in
El Greco	LOCATION	mostly a man chevauchant hors du possible .

		But that weighs little with me ;
Gautier	PERSON	heaven forbid !

		wrote of
Murillo	PERSON	's Miracle of St. An - thony : '' Jamais la magie de la peinture n ' a ete poussee plus loin ! ''

		But Mr.
Symons	PERSON	dwells on El
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 297
Greco	PERSON	's austerity , his spiritual realism , and on that color of his which was the reticence of a passionate abnegation .

		I see that the writer of this book feels indeed that the world is little more real than illusion is .

		He often supplants one 's experience of the illusion of real things with the reality of illusion .

		Perhaps sometimes there is a little too much the effect of tasting .

		Sometimes the effect is merely fantastic .

		And in places I miss the stiffening of intellect ; I miss the exaction of sheer mental vigor .

		Where emo - tion or sensuous response is strong or subtle or keen enough , it can carry itself ; for it is in itself informed with the matter of thought , of the intelligence .

		But Mr.
Symons	PERSON	has grown limp or soft at times , as his opposite in temperament might grow dry .

		And sometimes , now and then , the whole affair becomes a business , a sort of delicious hack-writing ; almost the `` style coulant cher aux bourgeois . ''

		And even at other times , when the sentences are golden , one pauses now and then to wish , perhaps ever so little , that so beautiful a mind and eye would settle into something a little more central , a stronger biting This is the primitive heroic theme of the North - downward toward a center .

		He pushes me so far at times that I go wishing for him something more of that stubborn English quality , that self-devoted obstinacy , that spiritual and almost insular individ - ual hold , that I and all of us so often revile .

		It is diverting to see when , in the middle of the book and for the remainder of it , we settle on Eng - land and English coasts and moors and streets how the quality and mood of the work alters .

		The style changes j it is no more intimate for the depths of the soul , but it is more personally and almost domestic - ally intimate .

		There is in the matter , also , more whimsicality , more individual preference , more min - uteness in less important preferences .

		The beauty set down in the things seen and in the mood of the ob - server is less spacious , is quieter and , I think , much thinner .

		He is forced to bring up out of himself more matter to complete and perfect and consummate the experience attached to external things .

		It is all not necessarily deeper or more profound , but it is less assisted by the sun and the fruits of the sun light , animation , and splendor .

		It is not necessar - ily deeper or more profound , as our own race likes to believe , but it is life turning on itself inwards , in the Northern way .

		About
London	LOCATION	Mr.
Symons	PERSON	is less comfortably ripe and town-fed and town-content than
Charles Lamb	PERSON	was .

		But he brings up to the record a mind more subtle-sensed than Lamb 's , a richer , more perilous nature , and an organism more exquisite and more nearly exotic .

		Mr.
Symons	PERSON	is not so journal - istic as Mr.
Thomas Burke	PERSON	, of Nights in
London	LOCATION	and
Limehouse Lights	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	's latest evangel ; he is not so busy or so eclectic , and I shall be dis - puted here not really more self-conscious , if more delicately so .

		Lamb and Mr.
Thomas Burke	PERSON	see
London	LOCATION	through eyes that are often like
Hogarth	PERSON	's or
Dickens	PERSON	' or Balzac 's with , in Mr.
Burke	PERSON	, a dash of the bold unmentionabilities and a blur of impressionism where Mr.
Symons	PERSON	sees it more as
Monet	ORGANIZATION	and
Verlaine	PERSON	would see it , I fancy .

		In the English country Mr.
Symons	PERSON	' work is in - terestingly less good .

		It is as if his mind fell back less easily on green lawns and cloud and rain in quiet key , less easily than on the light and stone , the strong romance and blood of
Spain	LOCATION	, or the nights in
London	LOCATION	, or the sails toward
Africa	LOCATION	set out from
Cadiz	LOCATION	.

		And after
John Synge	PERSON	no one should try to record the
Arran Islands	LOCATION	;
John Synge	PERSON	's style is the
Arran Islands	LOCATION	, and they are his style .

		Mr.
Syraons	PERSON	' style we all know by now .

		It is a style made up of sub - tle shading in phrase and imagery and cadence .

		It can be cloying , and it can be dazzling , palpitant , heady , and dominating .

		It seems English and for - eign at once .

		There is something in it of D'Annun - zio 's Italian as in the passage '' la musica silenziosa delle linee immobile era cosi possente che creava la fantasma , quasi visibile , di una vita piu ricca e piu bella '' but it is more elusive , and less firm and variable .

		It is copious sometimes like
Hofmanns	PERSON	- thal 's German ; it has something of
Gautier	PERSON	, of
Yeats	PERSON	, and the Pre-Raphaelites ; but all in all , at its best it is beautifully his own .

		And a book like this is valuable , if for nothing else because it may serve to increase one 's appara - tus for experience .

		Its method seems not to arrive merely through the medium of writing .

		It seems to employ all the arts to its delicate and pro- found ends .

		We get the sense of the car helping the eye .

		We remind the soles of our feet of swift - ness through the play of light , of rhythm , of ecstasy and mood .

		We exchange terms , we unify sensation and response .

		We see 'm to compose into one region of all arts the many sister and supporting arts .

		This method of the interplay and interborrowing of the terms and effects and channels of several arts at once gives us the sense almost of a new medium of expression .

		It may not reach any farther ultimately than what we have always had in the arts . '

		But it serves to enlarge our perception and our means of perception .

		It dilates our sense of the infinity and singularity and oneness of experience .

		And the dream of its possibilities has troubled many artists of our generation , though few can succeed with It as Mr.
Symons	PERSON	does .

		STARK YOUNG .

		298 THE DIAL
March 22	DATE	International Angling D URING THE EARLY PART of the war American readers were deluged by a storm of pamphlets and books that purposed to tell the `` truth about Ger - many . ''

		There was a chilly iteration in this litera - ture which convinced one that whether or not Ger - many was condemned , the impulse to know the truth was vindicated .

		The association of
America	LOCATION	with the Allies dispatched these explorations of the national being into other regions , and there now appears somewhat belatedly a further shower of books whose purpose is to embellish the truth about the more prominent Allies .

		On the whole , this fresh outburst does not fall on the same plane of veracity as that which dealt with
Germany	LOCATION	aspired to ; or , perhaps , it would be more accurate to say that it is exaggerative in the other direction .

		Whereas
Ralph Adams	PERSON	Cram and
Gilbert Chester	PERSON	- ton and
Gertrude Atherton	PERSON	branded the Prussians perhaps justly as demons ,
Charles Hanson Towne	PERSON	-LRB-
Shaking Hands With England Doran	ORGANIZATION	;
$ i	MONEY	-RRB- talks effusively as though the English were angels .

		It is true that Mr.
Towne	PERSON	avows himself apolo - getically no hero-worshipper ; but when he goes on to speak about his ecstasy in breathing the same air as that great statesman ,
Lloyd George	PERSON	, it is plain that the reverence he hesitates to pay heroes goes out instinctively to deity .

		Unfortunately this is the conventional atmosphere in which our inter - national friendships are conducted .

		There seems to be no mean level between the miasmas of hatred and the angelic rarity of the upper ether , and , as a result , the poor humanity which is common to all of us can find nothing to breathe .

		It is easy to grant the amiable intent of Mr.
Towne	PERSON	's effort to shake hands with the angels , or of Mr.
Frederick William Wile	PERSON	's attempt to ex - , plain away the idiosyncrasies of the tight little islanders -LRB- Explaining the Britishers Doran ;
$ i	MONEY	-RRB- .

		But it is equally easy to see that this literature per - petuates a vicious tradition .

		While discord between nations has been promoted by the patriotic lies which build , up the sacred egoism of the fatherland by magnifying its predatory exploits in contemptu - ous comparison with its rivals ' , the mischief is not to be remedied by raising a clamor of gratulatory fiction about a nation 's allies and friends .

		If the devilishness of
Prussia	LOCATION	puts that country beyond the pale of our friendship , the angelic qualities of our noble allies surely put them beyond the need of it .

		These polite fictions of state appear to have the sanction of Plato ; but in fact they work to no saner purpose than the malevolent subtleties of
Machia	LOCATION	- velli .

		The sort of peace that is built upon a fiction will itself prove to be a fiction .

		In other words , there can be no lasting comity of nations until we examine , more candidly than most of us are will - ing to do , the material elements that will clog the bearings of our international peace machinery , no matter how much oil we may inject into the cham - bers by way of removing the sentimental , psycho - logical causes of conflict .

		Both Messrs.
Towne	PERSON	and
Wile	PERSON	write for the Man in the Street , whose vague tribal resentful - ness against everything foreign an attitude more peculiar at present to the Man in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	they seek to subdue .

		Mr.
Wile	PERSON	's book , prefaced by Admiral
Sims	PERSON	, is obviously directed in its colloquial address at the personnel of the naval and military expeditionary forces .

		It is no more a serious inquiry into the national character of the Britisher than Mr.
Towne	PERSON	's book is the painstaking study of the milieu of
England	LOCATION	at war ; and it is written with a slick familiarity , a plausible digging of ribs and patting of shoulders , which is only too manifestly a newspaper correspondent 's idea of persuasive international salesmanship .

		To turn from these efforts to prepare for new history by whitewashing the old , and to pick up Dr.
Andrew McLaughlin	PERSON	's
America	LOCATION	and
Britain	LOCATION	-LRB- Dut - ton ;
$ 2	MONEY	-RRB- is to leave a diet of angel cake for the substantial bread and butter of reality .

		Dr.
McLaughlin	PERSON	's papers were originally read to British audiences , and this gives his treatment of American and British relations a consistency of purpose which delivers his historical theme from abstractness .

		As an informed scholar -LRB- Head of the
History Department	ORGANIZATION	at
Chicago	LOCATION	-RRB- Dr.
McLaughlin	PERSON	selects two parallel courses upon which he seeks to move toward an understanding .

		He is interested first of all in tracing the constitutional expression of American Federalism to its sources in
Britain	LOCATION	's eighteenth century Empire , and secondly in show - ing that the dissensions which preceded the Revolu - tionary War arose over the same problems of imperial organization which involve British states - men today .

		In this he has made a pertinent con - tribution to the history of the Federal principle .

		The other path of exposition leads to a discussion of Anglo-American state relations prior to the Great War .

		This is in the main a story of the exacerbating controversies which began even before the impressment of
American Seamen	ORGANIZATION	and which THE DIAL 299 continued even after - the
Newfoundland Fisheries	ORGANIZATION	dispute was adjusted , and it reminds the reader how the narrow patriotism of statesmen may per - petuate a traditional animosity long after its origi - nal causes are buried and presumably dead .

		With the substance of these events even the casual student is familiar .

		What is heartening in the present re - cital is its discriminating fairness and fine candor .

		In dealing with the
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, for example , Dr.
McLaughlin	PERSON	accepts equally the Eng - land of
Josiah Bounderby	PERSON	and the
America	LOCATION	of Jef - ferson Brick , and instead of insulting us like Mr.
Wile	PERSON	with the information that the
King	ORGANIZATION	is a per - petual President , he confesses that the inequality of
England	LOCATION	's electoral system prior to
1867	DATE	was one of the reasons for the oligarchic state 's distrust of
America	LOCATION	prior to that time .

		The outrageously successful career of
Canning	ORGANIZATION	's Doctrine perhaps better known to American politicians as
Monroe	PERSON	's may be attributed , on the other hand , to
England	LOCATION	's commercial interest in letting the new world of raw materials redress the balance of the old .

		In both instances the reader can not fail to see how deeply economic motives colored the state policies .

		Now Dr.
McLaughlin	PERSON	's ' papers point at once to the parity of English and American interests , and to the necessity for distrusting any attempt at leadership or selfish appropriation on the part of either of them .

		But if the nascent friendship be - tween the two countries is definitely to be realized , it must be on other terms than those which led Canning to urge the ''
Monroe	PERSON	'' Doctrine in the twenties and
Lord Salisbury	LOCATION	to reject it in the nineties .

		The good will of peoples is abraded by the antagonism of ruling class interests .

		Unless this good will can be harnessed to concrete prob - lems such as the competition of the American Mer - chant Marine , discriminatory colonial trade acts , and the like , it will dissipate itself ineffectually .

		The chief criticism to lay at Dr.
McLaughlin	PERSON	's door in these particular papers is that the im - mediacy of his audience prevented him from bring - ing his survey up to the present moment so as to deal with the shipping controversies of the first two years and a half of the war .

		That timidity was doubtless due to the war itself , during which the angel theory of friendly states held the field by rea - son of
Defense	ORGANIZATION	of the Realm and Espionage Acts .

		Now that the atmosphere is clearing , it would be timely to inquire into the spheres where
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	- American economic interests are dangerously dis - crepant .

		On the ability to perceive these danger points and on the common willingness to remove them , the success of the Anglo-American entente -LRB- with its offspring , the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- rests .

		Dr.
McLaughlin	PERSON	has admirably pitched the tone for this inquiry .

		The Great Hunger A HE EPIC MOTIVE OF MAN in warfare with nature is the first theme of The Great Hunger , by
Johan Bojer	PERSON	, translated from the Norwegian - by
W. J. Alexander Worster	PERSON	and
C. Archer	PERSON	-LRB-
Moffat Yard	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.60	MONEY	-RRB- .

		Peer Troen , the hero , bursts upon us in a typical adventure .

		The boys were forbidden to touch the big deep-sea line because '' the thing about a deep-sea line is that it may bring to the surface fish so big and so fearsome that the like has never been seen before . ''

		But as all the men of the vil - lage are off at the Lofoten fishery , Peer and his friends have carried the line across the fjord and baited the hooks .

		Now they are hauling in the catch : on the first hook a big cod , on the second a catfish , on the third a great shadow bearing up through the water , a gleam of white , a row of great white teeth on the underside a
Greenland	LOCATION	Shark . ''

		The heavy body big as a grown man was heaved in over the gunwale ... There it lay raging , the great black beast of prey with its sharp threatening snout and wicked eyes ablaze ... Now and again it would leap high up in the air , only to fall back again , writhing furiously , hissing and spitting and frothing at the mouth , its red eyes glaring from one to another of the terrified captors as if to say ' Come on just a little nearer . ' '

		Knives and gaffs were buried in the creature 's back , one gaff between the eyes while another hung on the flank .

		.

		Now Peer 's knife flashed out and sent a stream of blood from between the shoulders , but the blow cost him his foothold and in a moment the two bodies were rolling over and over together in the bottom of the boat .

		Then as the brute 's jaws seized Peer 's arm ,
Peter Ronningen	PERSON	dropped his oars and sent his knife straight in between the beast 's eyes .

		The blade pierced through to the bfain , and the grip of the teeth relaxed . ''

		C-c-cursed d-d-devil ! ''

		stammered
Peter	PERSON	, as he scrambled back to his oars .

		With this auspicious beginning Peer Troen , bastard , sets out to conquer his world .

		His path leads him far to the binding of the cataracts of the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	by barrage , and the taming of the jungles of Abyssinia by railroads .

		And at length this Beo - 300 THE DIAL
March 22	DATE	wulf returns to
Norway	LOCATION	, marries and has children about him , lives at ease in his great house at
Loreng	LOCATION	, full of the joy of life as he drives his stallions over the frozen lake , or comes home on ski in '' the pale winter evenings , with a violet twilight over woods and fields and lake , over white snow and blue '' home to rest , and wine , and joy .

		But the old restlessness leads him forth to a new adventure , the harnessing of the waters of the
Bresna	LOCATION	and its lakes far up in the mountains , a struggle with rock and flood and snow , and the weakness of human wills .

		His success is his ruin and once more he meets nature single-handed , forced back foot by foot along the path which he had climbed so joy - ously in the morning of his youth , back from the heights which he had reached to the valley whence he had started , weary , broken , but indomitable .

		This is the primitive heroic theme of the North - land , recognizable enough in its modern dress of steel and power .

		Mingled with it is another one of wistful , eager questioning , equally modern and northern .

		The meaning of this striving , this in - cessant urge toward conquest is it expressed in the words of Peer 's half brother ?

		`` You !

		Are you still going about feeling your own pulse and wanting to live forever ?

		My dear fellow , you do n't exist .

		There is just one person on our side the world-will .

		And that includes us all .

		That 's what I mean by ` we . '

		And we are working towards the day when we can make God respect us in good earnest .

		The spirit of man will hold a Day of Judgment , and settle accounts with
Olympus	ORGANIZATION	with the riddle , the almighty power beyond .

		It will be a great reckoning .

		And mark my words that is the one single religious idea that lives and works in each and every one of us the thing that makes us hold up our heads and walk upright , forgetting that we are slaves and things that die . ''

		No .

		It is not in the great wind , or the earth - quake , or the fire powers with which man can struggle but in the still small voice of human compassion that Peer finds his answer .

		Mercy , forgiveness , reconciliation with his fellow men one act of divine charity means more in Peer 's reading of the universe than all his triumphs over nature .

		`` I began to feel an unspeakable compassion for all men upon earth , and yet in the last resort I was proud that I was one of them .

		And I knew now that what I had hungered after in my best years was neither knowledge , nor honour , nor riches ; nor to be a priest or a great creator in steel ; no , friend , but to build temples ; not chapels for prayers or churches for wailing penitent sinners , but a temple for the human spirit in its gran - deur , where we could lift up our souls in an anthem as a gift to heaven . ''

		As he finishes planting his last bushel of corn in the field of his enemy , the slayer of his last darling child , he sees
Merle	PERSON	, his wife , smiling : '' As if she too , the stricken mother , had risen from the ocean of her suffering that here , in the daybreak , she might take her share in the creating of God . ''

		The Great Hunger is a book of individual striv - ing a type made familiar in northern literature by
Frenssen	ORGANIZATION	's Jb ` rn
Uhl	PERSON	and
Klaus Heinrich Baas	PERSON	.

		It will also recall to readers of an older generation Mrs.
Schreiner	PERSON	's Story of an African Farm .

		In The Great Hunger the northern scene the sea on sunlighted beaches or shadowed in overhanging fiords , the lakes , pine-encircled under moonlight , the iron hills , the wind-swept uplands , and the far fields of snow is cold and bright in color , clear and hard in atmosphere ; the human figures are attentuated to epic simplicity , perfectly comprehended and de - fined , and iacontestably real .

		In The African .

		Farm it is the veldt which stretches to infinity like the sea yellow under the sun , gray and violet under the stars : and the human beings who dwell upon it are held in bondage by their environment , pathetic in their subjection , vague in outline , as individuals only half disengaged from the vast blocks , of sub - conscious human stuff .

		The Great Hunger revives the epic manner as opposed to the impressionistic , psychoanalytic realism of which The Story of an African Farm contained such startling premonitions .

		But in theme the books will call to each other across the decades and across the world incarnat - ing the same energy of conquest , the same passion of understanding , the same thirst for God .

DONALD B. CLARK	PERSON	.

		1919 THE DIAL 301 The Unending Revolution OH ALL WE HAVE TO SAY that the most impartial histories are those written by prejudiced persons ?

		If the type of books dealing with the present Rus - sian Revolution are a standard , ail our criteria of historical accuracy must be revised .

		The most class - blind and stupid and unimaginative books describ - ing the events in
Russia	LOCATION	of
October	DATE	and
November , 1917	DATE	, when occurred one of the great crises in his - tory , are precisely those books written by men of integrity and personal rectitude the avowed non - partisans .

		Two examples of the latter kind of book are before me :
Russia	LOCATION	's Agony by
Robert Wilton	PERSON	-LRB-
Dutton	LOCATION	;
$ 5	MONEY	-RRB- and Russian Revolution Aspects by
Robert Crozier	PERSON	Long -LRB-
Dutton	LOCATION	;
$ 2.50	MONEY	-RRB- .

		Mr.
Wil	PERSON	- ton says in his preface , '' Men , events , and condi - tions have , I believe , been dealt with in a spirit of fairness ; '' and although Mr.
Long	PERSON	more modestly claims to be merely a journalist describing events , he yet can dogmatically make the astounding asser - tion that there was never any substantial founda - tion for the belief of the masses in the danger of a counter-revolution , that '' the whole of Russian society was , and is , radical in its view of policy and economy . ''

		It is difficult to give full justice to obtuseness or unconscious snobbery on the one hand -LRB- '' Having partaken of caviare and other deli - cacies -RCB- '' intones Mr.
Wilton	PERSON	in his account of a reception at court , '' we sat down to a modest repast served on silver '' -RRB- , or , on the other hand , to mere sketchy and impressionistic journalism .

		These vol - umes may be intrinsically interesting ; that is not important .

		What is important is that they can not give anything like an illuminating interpretation of that great mass uprising which we call the pro- letarian revolution .

		The authors are astigmatic with the definiteness of all those who assume their vision to be normal ; biased by those clusters of un - conscious beliefs which are called impartiality be - cause the surface of the mind remains unruffled .

		Books of this type can not possibly give us any real understanding of an entirely new social phenomenon ; they can only flatter our own a priori notions of what that phenomenon should be , familiarize us with the strange by absorb - ing it into those conventional categories with which we are already acquainted .

		They present an analogy to the testimony of Ambassador
Francis	PERSON	before the
Senate Committee	ORGANIZATION	testimony which was the expression of a desire rather than a description of fact , and all the more pernicious because the de - sire -LRB- in this case to discredit the Soviet Government in
Russia	LOCATION	-RRB- was unrecognized .

		Now to turn from these `` impartial '' books and investigators to an author who prefaces his volume with the frank statement that in '' the struggle my sympathies were not neutral , '' and who does not hesitate to reveal his belief in the justness of one side as opposed to another , is to discover that the paradoxical question which began this article has more than paradoxical value .

		For a prejudice admitted in advance is a prejudice robbed of nine - tenths of its power for evil .

		Ten Days That Shook The World by
John Reed	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
Boni & Live	ORGANIZATION	- right ;
$ 2	MONEY	-RRB- is a far more objective and impartial description of events than are any of the hundreds of volumes of Mr.
Wilton	PERSON	's or Mr.
Long	PERSON	's kind .

		Mr.
Reed	PERSON	knew what he wanted to happen ; the reader knows what the author wanted ; the cards are on the table .

		It is not the things which ` are said in a historical volume that do harm ; it is the things which are left unsaid and it is a curious fact that Mr.
Reed	PERSON	quotes more anti-Bolshevik statements and gives more gener - ously the anti-Bolshevik point of view than do most of those industrious apologists so anxious to prove Bolshevism a menace to all civilization and decent living .

		Furthermore , Mr.
Reed	PERSON	had the advantage of being on the side that won : he began with the conviction that eventually it was going to win , and if to be a good prophet is to be a bad historian , Mr.
Reed	PERSON	will have to put up with his critics .

		For when your interpretation of anything is justified later by the course of events , you can afford to be generous with your opponents .

		It is those who are on the losing side that have difficulty in see - ing straight ; hence the never-ending predictions of the `` careful '' historians that the
Bolsheviki	PERSON	would last a week , then a week more , then a month , then a month more , then finally that their time was short , and ultimately of course that they held power only by the tyranny of a small number of unscrupu - lous fanatics .

		The rather simple explanation that '' the majority of the 180 millions of people in Rus - sia might have had something to do with it could hardly have been expected to enter into their cal - culations .

		That would have been to give their case away in advance .

		Mr.
Reed	PERSON	, then , has the initial advantages of straight-forwardness and of guessing right .

		But he discloses other virtues in the book itself .

		Those who remember Mr.
Reed	PERSON	for his fine impression - istic descriptions of the revolution in
Mexico	LOCATION	will perhaps be taken aback at the almost severe quality of this present narrative .

		With opportunity after 302 THE DIAL
March 22	DATE	opportunity for '' purple patches '' Mr.
Reed	PERSON	shows a restraint which practically vacuum-cleans the book of any mere rhetorical passages .

		He is content to let the narrative flow on naturally and quietly , welded together by the hammer of relevant fact after relevant fact , in short paragraphs which fre - quently end in a tiny row of dots , a happy incor - poration of the technique of Wellsian suggestive - ness .

		Often he includes proclamations of the vari - ous parties and statements and speeches of the party leaders in the text itself , although the more impor - tant of the documentary material is included in an appendix which historians of the future will find as invaluable as the living observers of today .

		The story does not lack emotional thrill because of this deliberately chosen method of unemphatic presenta - tion .

		If anything , it gains .

		Mr.
Reed	PERSON	has taken only ten days of the Bolshevik Revolution the vital ten days with short glimpses before them and few after .

		Consequently there is some inevitable repeti - tion .

		But the effect is cumulative .

		A picture of the state of mind which made the Bolsheviki up - rising inevitable emerges gradually , with the out - lines of the picture becoming sharper and sharper , until finally it stands forth etched with unforget - able definiteness .

		The author , for instance , seldom tells you what he thinks the proletariat , the toiling masses , the soldiers , the workers and peasants , are saying .

		He lets them speak for themselves at just the correct dramatic moment .

		He selects their spokesmen not only with the unerring precision of the partisan but also with the wisdom of the jour - nalist in choosing those who are truly representa - tive .

		It is this sense of the inevitability of the course of events which gives the book its finest quality the slow rising flood of hatred for the war among the soldiers , the slow rising flood of suspicion on the part of the peasants that
Kerensky 's Government	ORGANIZATION	might promise them the land but had no intention of helping them to get it , the slow rising anger of the workers who wanted to take over the industries for themselves and who found them - selves blocked at every turn .

		Against this mass anger and hatred and suspicion the futile temporiz - ing of the Provisional Government was bound to be ultimately powerless .

		It had to go swept away in the full tide of proletarian revolt .

		Nothing is more illuminating in Mr.
Reed	PERSON	's book than his de - scription of the simplicity of the issues as they pre - sented themselves to the minds of the masses of the Russian people ; their struggle to understand , and , once understanding , their unshakable deter - mination to do battle for their faith .

		And the lesson we can learn from it is plainly this -LRB- although Mr.
Reed	PERSON	does not say so -RRB- that the morale of proletarian revolution before it is successful is the morale of despair , coupled with hope , but that the morale of proletarian revolution after it has seized power is the morale of defense , of fighting for what is its own .

		That is what , for all its enemies at home and abroad , has made the Soviet Government so far invincible .

		It is what , if anything , will make it invincible in the future .

		It is this curious blend of conviction and proph - ecy and belief in the fundamental justness of the claims of the masses for a richer life which gives Mr.
Reed	PERSON	's book its emotional reach .

		It is , so to speak , the unconscious ideology to which his feelings are attached .

		But it would be a mistake to put his services to us in this book on what , after all , is the rather tenuous and intangible basis of emotional satisfaction .

		What he has really given us is not only the record of a great event , but a kind of handbook of reference for the future .

		The Russian proletarian revolution is not likely to be the last ; as past centuries saw political revolutions spreading imitatively from one country to another , so our century will in all likelihood see that new social order the economic revolution also spread - ing imitatively from one country to another .

		Mr.
Reed	PERSON	has pictured the conflict of classes with such precision and finality that his account of
Petro	PERSON	- grad during those ten days furnishes a sort of microcosm of what happened all over
Russia	LOCATION	shortly afterwards , and what we have already seen hap - pen in parts of
Germany	LOCATION	.

		It takes no great gift of prophecy to see that it is also a microcosm of what , in varying forms , is certain to take place in many other countries , perhaps even here in safe
America	LOCATION	where nobody yet believes in a Soviet revolution except the
Overman Committee	ORGANIZATION	, army officers , and government officials , who are being driven by their fear to just those actions most nicely calculated to encourage such a revolution .

		We can see their prototypes in the vacillating officers of the
Provisional Government	ORGANIZATION	in
Petrograd	LOCATION	.

		We can also see how Allied diplomacy failed utterly to un - derstand the Revolution and its economic basis , and how , by that failure , it helped to drive the Revolu - tion more and more toward the Left just as today Allied diplomacy , by failing to understand the Ger - man Revolution is driving it as inexorably toward the Left .

		We can see how Kerensky was by the logic of events driven more and more to rely upon the counter-revolutionists and the reactionary prop - ertied classes , thus losing the confidence of the people just as today
Ebert	LOCATION	, by the logic of events , is being driven to rely upon the same class inter - ests in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		For when before in the history of the world have we had , in such a short space of time , two revolu - tions of this magnitude succeeding each other and
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 303 following so sharply the same general outlines ?

		I recommend Mr.
Reed	PERSON	's book to
Marshal Foch	ORGANIZATION	and to the Allied delegates who are drawing up the terms of peace for
Germany	LOCATION	at
Versailles	LOCATION	.

		If they are really perturbed by the growth of Bolshevism in
Germany	LOCATION	, it might be as well for them to for - get for a time the myths which they have so indus - triously spread for the consumption of the Allied publics and give attention to the few simple and obvious facts of the class struggle as it actually developed in
Russia	LOCATION	.

		They will find these simple and obvious facts in this book .

		Yet it is doubtful if they could draw any sensible conclusions from them : the Allied diplomats in
Petrograd	LOCATION	could not see what was actually taking place day by day around them within physical sight and hearing .

		No blindness is so great as the blindness of class Mr.
Reed	PERSON	's book reveals that with incisive vividness .

		It also reveals one more thing , which Americans can not admit without shame that from the day the
Bolsheviki	PERSON	came into power we were so supine and cowardly that we allowed ourselves to believe what press and government thought fit to tell us about the proletarian revolution in
Russia	LOCATION	, that the first democracy of the West played false to the greatest economic experiment and social adventure in the history of the world .

		For if one thing is now clear to all people of intelligence it is this : that the
Bolsheviki	PERSON	were the most implacable enemies of German imperialism in
Russia	LOCATION	and that if we had cared more about defeating
Germany	LOCATION	quickly than we did about crushing a revolution , we should have hastened to cooperate with
Soviet Russia	LOCATION	in its unequal fight against Kaiserism .

		But with fine words on our lips we deserted them .

		Shall we com - mit the ultimate perfidy sign a treaty of peace which is a mockery of our democratic pretensions ?

		Perhaps .

		Then if we do , we at least can have no excuse for not knowing what will happen .

		It will be what happened in
Petrograd	LOCATION	and
Moscow	LOCATION	all over again , what Mr.
Reed	PERSON	has described in this book .

		And the ten days which , as the author justly says , shook the world will inevitably develop into the coming ten years which will transform it .

		HAROLD STEARNS .


France	LOCATION	and a
Wilsonian Peace N	ORGANIZATION	, ow THAT
THE LEAGUE of Nations	ORGANIZATION	has , amidst the applause of the
Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	, been reduced to writing , a forward movement of humanity be - yond anything known to history becomes possible on the single condition that the world will apply itself with good will and energy to the task of carry - ing the League from its present paper stage into the realm of social and historical reality .

		Essentially this is a labor of the spirit , which to be effective must win the support of the leading spokesmen of the great nations of the world .

		The League , when completed , should be a sensitive and elastic in - stitution drawing its vital fluid and steadily renew - ing it from the creative energy of mankind .

		Already the call to the leaders has gone forth with what result ?

		Among ourselves in many high-placed circles , in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, among outstanding represen - tatives of business and the press it has met with skepticism verging on derision and everywhere in
Europe	LOCATION	among corresponding groups the same in - stinctive aversion is alarmingly apparent .

		These watchdogs and beneficiaries of the existing system , these bcati possidentes , want no hazy ventures aim - ing at the distribution of their advantages among the common run of men and unsettling the status quo ; they want to get back as soon as possible to the old basis , to the old game , to '' business as usual , '' and to this end they need nothing so much as a swift settlement with all the spoils in sight tucked away in the pockets of the victors the familiar statesmen 's peace of history .

		And of all the Allied ruling classes the distinction of putting up the most stubborn as well as the most subtle resistance to the new idea seems to fall to the French group .

		It is worth while to puzzle out the reasons , especially as the French position is certain to prove typical ; and since
Andre Cheradame	PERSON	is a great name in the political and literary circles of his country we may reason - ably hope to squeeze enlightenment out of his most recent book The Essentials of an Enduring Vic - tory -LRB-
Scribner	ORGANIZATION	,
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- .

		Cheradame , as one of the matadors of the French propaganda , has dwelt among us for some time and in this book , thrown together apparently from news - paper articles and as little unified as a book can well be and remain a book , he makes a distraught but passionate appeal to American opinion in be - half of the policy which we may safely assume to be more or less that of the government he repre - sents .

		Let not the reader imagine a set argument against the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	or any related item of the Wilsonian program .

		Apart from the fact that such an attack upon his war-time host would be in extremely bad form , the excited author has neither taste nor leisure for the deliberate discussion of anything pertaining to peace , a Wilsonian peace , 34 THE DIAL
March 2	DATE	; and spends his fury on one subject and only one on victory .

		And what is victory , enduring victory , that cure of every ill ?

		For , let it be observed , this particular victor , like his long line of forbears in the conquering business , wants what the gods have always vainly been implored to give , a victory with a guarantee of permanence attached .

		Let us analyze this victory of
Cheradame	ORGANIZATION	's desire and at once admit that in many essential features it is fully consonant with the commitments resting on
America	LOCATION	by virtue of President
Wilson	PERSON	's various messages .


Mittel	PERSON	- Europa or
Pangermany	LOCATION	, as
M. Cheradame	PERSON	prefers to call it , must be destroyed ,
France	LOCATION	must have back
Alsace-Lorraine	LOCATION	, and ample financial and eco - nomic reparation must be made for the damage and destruction wrought in the regions occupied and har - ried by the German forces .

		So far , so good : Amer - ica 's whole influence at the peace Conference will be behind these demands to which American public opinion has steadily and passionately adhered .

		But now comes the arresting thing -LRB- and there - with Cheradame passes beyond the American ken into the murky atmosphere in which the French rul - ing classes seem to delight to fix their abode -RRB- : no - where does he claim the above terms by reason of the President 's words , in fact he practically never refers to the President at all .

		And as for the Four - teen Points , to which
France	LOCATION	no less than her Allies has solemnly committed herself , they do not once re - ceive even a modest Mention Honorable in a book dedicated to the idea of a world settlement !

		By the very simple procedure of ignoring their existence , the
Fourteen Points	ORGANIZATION	are effectively reduced to four - teen scraps of paper .

		The omission by itself tells volumes as to
Cheradame	ORGANIZATION	's mentality .

		He acted logically enough since he does not seek peace but vic - tory , a victory dictated by
France	LOCATION	and a narrow na - tionalist conception of her interests , dictated more precisely by the fierce spirit of revenge which by , virtue of forty years ' seasoning in the dark cellars of the human mind has become like a strong and heady wine .

		Under the circumstances
Cheradame	ORGANIZATION	's terms can hardly be expected to carry any promising suggestions of world pacification .

		Broadly they are : All
Germany	LOCATION	to be occupied by the Allies and a tri - umphal entrance made into
Berlin	LOCATION	; her economic life to be put under Allied direction and the whole popu - lation to be obliged to work for foreign account ; the profits of this arrangement , valued at
ten billion marks	MONEY	per annum , to be distributed among the Allies , and this stranglehold to be maintained for fifty years .

		On the territorial side there is a little vagueness , due to a host 's polite desire not to appear to be set - ting limits to the appetite of the guests whom he has summoned to the feast .

		In general he invites them French , Poles , Czechs , and
Danes	PERSON	to claim as much German soil as they think they can digest , without regard for the principle of nationality .

		That principle is excellent , but of course has no validity for an outlaw nation like
Germany	LOCATION	.

		It is , as I have said , the mind behind these terms which interests the world at the present juncture , because it discloses not the attitude of an individual , but rather that of the leaders of the French Intelligentsia and
Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		Judging by
Cheradame	ORGANIZATION	's book we may conclude that these men , generally speaking , do not have their eye on peace , a healing peace , at all .

		They aim at victory , a vic - tory moreover prompted by the spirit of revenge .

		And under the spur of this sentiment there has lodged itself within the French mind a concept and a picture of the German enemy so revolting , so inhuman , that the severest attitude toward him and the extreme measure against him become at once morally justified .

		The German , the minds en - meshed in this reasoning assure themselves , is differ - ent , he is not like other Europeans , he simply has no place among civilized men .

		Cheradame at least entertains no doubts whatever on this head .

		He pic - tures the German as moved exclusively by `` a passion for spoils , '' till finally he arrives at the historically immutable barbarian `` whose mentality , whose pas - sion for wars of gain and for pillage , has remained the same ever since it was described by Tacitus . ''

		Throughout the length of the book there is no other explanation of the war so much as hinted at except this unvarying one of the German savagery .

		That we live in an industrial world controlled by com - petitive capital , that we have clashing colonial and imperialist policies , that the European world , with the French regularly in the thick of the fray , has for many centuries revolved around these issues , pro- ducing a sheer endless string of wars all this is as completely sponged from the record as if it had not been .

		One 's head whirls at a procedure content to imitate the terrier , who sits with his eye singly and fanatically fixed on a hole in the ground , completely oblivious of the stirring happenings on the earth about him and in the air above .

		If the French ter - rier can but catch the German rat and rend it , peace will follow automatically throughout the world , a permanent peace , bringing in its joyous train all the lost blessings of
Eden	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a reading of history so simple one could almost wish that it were true ; but since it is not true , since it is in fact a delusion fan - tastic to a point almost beyond belief , it becomes our duty to resist it and the proposed victory arrange - ments based thereon .

		The new world edifice can not be raised on the foundations of an evil dream .

		This then is the mind with which President Wil - son has been lately dealing in
Paris	LOCATION	and with which the world will have to reckon for many years to
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 35 come .

		For those forward-looking groups , every - where as yet a minority , who wish to sink the roots of the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	deep in the human spirit it is a serious situation .

		Well may they anxiously take counsel , but if they are wise they will be calm and patient and pin their faith to reason and to mod - eration , assuming as a matter of course the final vic - tory of the moral forces by which alone a democratic world can live .

		From every fair and reasonable angle
France	LOCATION	has a right to ask for certain things and no right whatever to go beyond that limit .

		With full and even generous measure she must be given what a nation which has gone through her harrow - ing experiences longs for as the great desideratum : peace with security .

		Over and over again she must be told and have explained to her that her best se - curity , her only real security , does not lie in fresh German annexations , such as the valley of the Saar and the Rhineland , but in a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	which alone can put an overwhelming force behind the present settlement .

		And she must be asked to con - sider carefully a
Germany	LOCATION	wounded past healing by wanton excisions from her flesh .

		Will not such a
Germany	LOCATION	in her turn nurse the revenge which as
France	LOCATION	knows but too well , poisons the spiritual life at the source and gives assurance of a new war with - in a generation ?

		Shall the tide of war ebb and flow over
France	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	in the future as in the past , onward to the close of time ?

		Incalculable is the injury which humanity has already suffered from this prolonged national feud , nor is it extrav - agant to forecast that unless it be composed the whole world will in the end be wrecked by it .

		Fortunately in favor of its composition the soundest elements of all the civilized nations are raising their voices , and it would be strange indeed if the dis - cordant voice to which we have been listening were the only one heard in
France	LOCATION	in this crisis .


France	LOCATION	has other spokesmen than the official patriots mo - mentarily in the saddle ; she has a great body of workingmen whose generous traditions will not per - mit them to seal their lips at command of their rulers .

		On
December 14	DATE	, at
Paris	LOCATION	, there was read to President
Wilson	PERSON	an address which our daily press failed to print for reasons only too patent .

		Speak - ing on behalf of the Socialist party and the
General Confederation of Labor	ORGANIZATION	,
Pierre Renaudel	PERSON	squarely planted himself behind the Wilsonian program , em - phasizing `` the deep harmony of thought which ex - ists between the French workers and the President of the
United States	LOCATION	regarding the conception of war and peace . ''

		And then in ringing words aimed doubtless straight at French officialdom , he protested against the attempt `` to transform this war of de - fense into a war of conquests which would prepare new conflicts , create new grievances , and subject the peoples more than ever to the double yoke of armaments and war . ''

		Once more , the supporters of a new world as rep - resented by the Wilsonian program need not despair , though the difficulties ahead may often seem almost insurmountable .

		Time and a certain decency in the average man may be trusted gradually to clear the road for the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	.

		Even
M. Chera	PERSON	- dame may be converted to it , though admittedly only by a special act of grace .

		But should he and his bourgeois kind prove hopelessly stiffnecked , there at any rate are the working people , in
France	LOCATION	as every - where else the real servants of the spirit , to remind their rulers , not suppliantly either , we may be sure , that a new dawn is breaking in the east .

		They are a moment seen Tossing their golden balls , Or running far , far Beyond the sands where the skies vanish .

		They come again In the dawn twilight , In the bird-broken silences .

		But they are gone Ungathered Cliff-flowers , The grace of foam Lost in the bitter green waters .


BABETTE DEUTSCH	PERSON	.

		306 THE DIAL
March 22	DATE	The American Note IN THE OPENING CHAPTER of his
The American Spirit	ORGANIZATION	in Literature -LRB-
Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 3.50	MONEY	-RRB- , Professor
Perry	PERSON	has defined his plan : We are primarily concerned with a procession of men each of whom is interesting as an individual and as a writer .

		But we can not watch the individuals .

		long with - out perceiving the general direction of their march , the ideas that animate them , the common hopes and loyalties that make up the life of their spirit .

		To become aware of these general tendencies is to understand the ''
Ameri	PERSON	- can '' note in our national writing .

		It is a hard plan to follow in a book of less than seventy thousand words , though it is far from an impossible one .

		It demands the ripeness of judg - ment with which we credit Mr.
Perry	PERSON	, and also an utter singleness of purpose and a ruthless omission of every fact not indispensable to the broad scheme .

		The book is composed of ten chapters , four on the colonial centuries , ending - with The Revolution , five on the half century culminating with
Union	ORGANIZATION	and Liberty , and one , The New Nation , for all the im - plications of the American spirit in literature since
1865	DATE	.

		The rapid surveys on The Pioneers and The First Colonial Literature are well balanced and thoroughly familiar .

		The generalizations are sound as far as they go , and they are well supported by readable detail .

		They are marked , too , by the usual omission of several of the most felicitous early writers who bear witness to the early reactions against Puritanism
Thomas Morton	PERSON	, who flayed them joyously in
1637	DATE	;
Nathaniel Ward	PERSON	, whose Simple Cobbler is an unrecognized classic ; and
Sarah Kemble Knight	PERSON	, whose Journal reveals the hidden reefs of unorthodoxy on which the Mathers were wrecked .

		The chapter on the Civil War issues is the best fused of all , perfectly unified , and well condensed , a complete fulfillment of the plan laid down at the outset .

		In a different way the nine pages on
Thoreau	ORGANIZATION	are admirable .

		They repeat little of the usual material ; but , without any notable disagreement from the ordinary judgments , they are fresh , fair , and sympathetic , and withal are written with a friendly suavity of style ` which befits the treatment as of one who appreciates the man , but does not take him quite as seriously as he took himself .

		Yet as a whole Mr.
Perry	PERSON	has not lived up to his program , and , for one reason , because it was too big a one for so small a book .

		There is no room in such a survey for the same biographical facts which no textbook could omit .

		Circumstantial details of a purely informative sort are intrusively de trop in a series of broad interpretations .

		One resents hav - ing to crowd his knees under a schoolroom desk when he has been invited to a Phi Beta Kappa oration .

		Moreover , though there is a surfeit of negligible information in the book , it is far from scrupulously accurate .

		When Mr.
Perry	PERSON	says of the
Roger Williams-John	PERSON	Cotton controversy '' Back and forth the books fly , '' he hardly suggests the ponderously labored exchanges at intervals of three to five years .

		In his quotation against
Bronson Alcott	PERSON	of Emer - son 's '' tedious archangel , '' he forgets the prevailing tone of admiration in a dozen more important pass - ages .

		When he alludes to
Francis Scott Key	PERSON	as '' of an earlier generation '' than
John Howard Payne	PERSON	, he evidently does not know that the two were closer contemporaries than
Emerson	LOCATION	and
Lowell	LOCATION	.

		And his allusion to
Payne	PERSON	as '' a single poem man '' points to his utter and utterly con - ventional neglect of the drama as a factor in Amer - ican literary history .

		This leads to the most unsatisfying feature of the book that it takes no particular stock in the creators of the American spirit , the dreamers and the iconoclasts .

		A tone of complacent pragmatism pervades the estimates from first to last .

		Whitman is discussed with cautious deference ;
Longfellow	LOCATION	,
Whittier	LOCATION	,
Lowell	LOCATION	, and
Holmes	PERSON	are all commended for having too much art , poetic instinct , and humor to fall into the search for the unattainable .

		Mark Twain is given less space than
Bret Harte	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	is dismissed , in less than two pages , without a mention of his social convictions or of any novel of his later career ; and
Henry James	PERSON	, who had no social convictions , is given twice the space .

		Natur - ally a book of such safe and sane conservatism would limit itself to judgments on the remoter past .

		And this book does .

		Just one tenth is devoted to the period since the Civil War , and a bare fifth of that tenth to the really vital things written since
1890	DATE	.

		And yet in this
last century	DATE	, and especially in this last genera - tion , the changes in the American spirit have been as great as let us say the literary differences between
James Russell Lowell	PERSON	and his distinguished niece .

		In one of Mr.
Perry	PERSON	's early pages is a promising allusion to '' productions which caught the fancy of a whole generation . ''

		But in his last chapter he evades discussion of contemporary drama and poetry with the statements that it is too soon to speak of one and impossible to forecast the other .

		The student of American literary historv owes
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 37 much of his acquaintance with the past spirit of
America	LOCATION	to the old critics ' comments on their con - temporaries .

		A reader of a hundred years hence would gather from Mr.
Perry	PERSON	's book the wholly false impressions that American literature went into retirement at the
end of the nineteenth century	DATE	; that since then there had been no redefining of wealth , citizenship , or patriotism ; and that the American spirit in contemporary literature was either retro - spective or timidly self-distrustful .


PERCY H. BOYNTON	PERSON	.

		T , The Independents HE
NEW YORK	LOCATION	PAPERS have printed an item to the effect that the third annual exhibition of the Society of Independent Artists will open at the
Waldorf Astoria	LOCATION	on
March 28	DATE	, and the an - nouncement sounds as prim and businesslike as any other .

		A first exhibition smacks of novelty and romance , but the words '' third annual '' carry with them the banality and stuffiness of routine officialdom .

		And then the implication of gilded success in the place where the show will be held what concern have thinking men with art societies which parade the heavy dignity of their regular habits and their big membership in the halls of the wealthy ?

		The challenge is a fair one , the only one that we of the Independents have reason to fear .

		For in the present era it is not failure in the esti - mation of the public that dismays the artist he must tremble and search his face for fat and sod - denness when he is visited by popular success .

		Come to the show , then , you thinking men for whom it is given , and see what is behind the '' antiche maschere '' of your Pagliacci .

		Here you see them all , everyone who cares to exhibit , and so you have your hand on the pulse of American art .

		If the paintings and sculptures are good , then the success is the success of this country , for the works come from every part of the country and the
Society	ORGANIZATION	's foundation principle of No Jury means that every tendency in our art may have its voice here ; if the exhibition is bad , then the failure is , temporarily at least , the failure of American art .

		The question of the permanence and the financial status of the society is really aside from the point , for as long as it keeps to the law it made for itself at the outset , it will not grow old even as the French society of the same name , after more than ten times the existence of ours , still maintains its youth , its freedom , its undisputed position as the battleground of new ideas .

		Where should they appear if not at such exhibi - tions ?

		All that 1 is asked of the artist in the French society and in its American descendant is that he subscribe to the system of '' No Jury , No Prizes , '' and pay his small membership dues .

		After that , he may show what he likes , either , as in the ma - jority of cases , the wares he hopes to sell or , as in the case of a goodly minority , the expression of ideas he thinks important , of the sensations through which he finds beauty .

		An Independent show offers the great adventure of the world of contemporary art : amidst its mass of mediocrity one can find the living ideas of the time .

		It is only at such a place that one can find them , for an open door is needed before they will ask for admission .

		It is senseless to rail against the hostility toward new forms which one finds in official or commercial institutions the galleries of the academies or of the dealers .

		Men who have reached a certain age , with venera - tion for their art , and the mental inelasticity which is bound to come in time -LRB- save in splendidly ex - ceptional cases -RRB- can see only vandalism where the young men see development .

		It is not fair to ask that these older men give their sanction to things which seem the denial and destruction of every - thing they have worked for , to ask that they vote to have the innovators in their exhibitions , on a chance that amongst the ineptitudes of which every generation has a majority , they may be getting a genius .

		They can not distinguish between the two classes and I do not speak only of the weaklings among the old men , but of the greatest of them .

		Renoir , on being asked about an artist of the younger generation around whom the battle of opinion was raging , answered : '' I can not very well speak of him ; I can not see everything that is going on ; and then , too , one is of one 's time in spite of oneself .

		Ask me about Manet ,
Monet	ORGANIZATION	,
Degas	LOCATION	, and
Cezanne	ORGANIZATION	, and I can give you clearly formed opinions , for I lived , worked , and struggled with them .

		But with the young men the question is different , I can not speak so freely . ''

		The essential phase of the question is not that the young men need the chance to express them - selves .

		What is a thousand times more important is that it is the ideas of the young men that the world needs .

		The giants of art are giants in their twenties .

		They may go on , in later life , to more of depth and mellowness , but their ideas are to be 38 THE DIAL
March 22	DATE	found in their early works .

		And these ideas are the burning-point of the thought of all men in their time .

		It is less clearly formed in the mass of men , less intense , diluted and muddy with the lees of earlier thought ; but when the years have had their clarifying influence we find , and without exception , that the character of the period was expressed by the men who were young at the time .

		Why should the world wait till they are old or dead , to have the use of their vision ?

		It is too late then ; thought has moved on , the old men 's work goes to the mu - seum , and the world repeats its tragic blunder of ignoring the voices which for that day utter its purpose . ''

		Place aux jeunes ! ''

		cried Puvis de
Chavannes	LOCATION	; there is no need that the farce be repeated forever , though the impulse toward it will always be part of our nature .

		When this impulse gains complete control , when the new ideas are not only pushed aside at birth but actually cut of -RCB- from germina - tion , we have the condition called decadence .

		Was there ever a more degenerate perversion of the term than that which tried to fasten it to the fecundity we witnessed in the last half-century ?

		Fortu - nately the period was strong enough to fight off the senility that so continually tried to make of art the sterile wanton which amuses the leisure of old and corrupt societies .

		It is proof of the cleanness and health of our age that the great work in it was done not alone by the young men , but also by those who carried into later life the force to go on producing .

		It can not be said too often that the Independent exhibition is open to anyone who chooses to show in it .

		And it is worth while to recall here that a very large proportion of the works hung during its first two years of existence were of conservative , even reactionary , tendencies .

		What a mixture one finds there : the best and worst of our older artists , the best and worst of the younger men , those whom no exhibition no museum , almost would refuse , those whom no other exhibition would admit .

		As I speak from a purely personal standpoint here , I may use names and recall that twice the member - ship has included Mr.
Prendergast	PERSON	, and twice his splendid and complete art has figured in the ex - hibition .

		Among the younger men I will mention
Morton L. Schamberg	PERSON	, one of the founders of the Society , whose untimely death last fall deprived this country of an artist who had already done im - portant work and from whom even more was to be expected .

		What interests us , above all , at the ex - hibition is the chance of finding unknown talent .

		In a number of cases the hope has been fulfilled to admiration .

		The work which probably attracted most attention at last year 's Independents was the sculpture of Mrs.
Victor Soskice	PERSON	, a young Russian artist who had come to
America	LOCATION	but a few months previously .

		One always wonders what will be sent from the West that region which includes everything beyond the
Hudson	LOCATION	, and of which
New York	LOCATION	knows little .

		Even the so plentiful bad things of the show seem to take on some nuance of amiability , as if caught up in the spirit of equal opportunity .

		At least they are relieved of the offensiveness that attaches to them when they are put forward as the choice of a jury or when an attempt is made to dissimulate the scent of their staleness with the incense of a prize .

		Is the Independents ' denial of both the jury 's authority and the mob 's the final step in unbridled individualism ?

		I think not ; it is rather a step toward that solidarity which we hope to see as a mark of the era on which we are entering .

		An interesting means of approach to this solidarity , a means which has been discussed several times but which most artists would not at present be willing to adopt , consists in the omission from the catalogue of the names of the producers of the works , thus making art anonymous , as it was in the Gothic and certain other periods .

		Every movement in the world 's thought is prefigured by its expression in the quickly responding medium of art , and the vitality of the Independent principle , which has had to fight hard for existence , in
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, is due to the fact that it corresponds with some deep current of evolution .

		The problem is to give to the most important elements of society an opportunity to get their place and their recogni - tion , while reserving for the weaker members at least the right to live .

		The fact that many of our most distinguished men have been willing to forego all privilege and let their works stand on their merits in the exhibition , and the fact .

		Droved beyond argument at the Independent shows , that merit will secure recognition whether its possessor is fa - mous or unknown , are more than chance incidents ; they have a significance beyond the field of art , in the broader movement toward a collective effort in society .

		But one really does not want to worry too much about social philosophies when seeing pictures .

		The artists themselves certainly do not ; what they contribute to such matters comes purely as an un - conscious by-product of the single interest of their lives which is to do their work .


WALTER PACH	PERSON	.

		THE DIAL
GEORGE DONLIN TOHN DEWEY ROBERT MORSS LOVETT	PERSON	, Editor
CLARENCE BRITTEN	PERSON	In Charge of the Reconstruction Program .

		THORSTEIN
VEBLEN HAROLD STEARNS HELEN MAROT	PERSON	-- HE CHIEF IMMEDIATE VALUE OF THE COVENANT of the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	is to serve as a basis of reconciliation upon which terms of peace may be based .

		That this is the view of the Covenant as it applies to the smaller nations is clear .

		It is ex - pected that in its light the Poles and the Ruthenians , the Italians and the Jugo-Slavs , the Roumanians and the Hungarians will be able to lay aside their traditional feuds and accept the law of peace .

		It is surprising to find great reluctance to accept this view as respects the larger antagonists and the funda - mental quarrel of the world war .

		Indeed , it is clear that many defenders of the Covenant regard it as a means of perpetuating this quarrel , and un - derwriting revenge .

		That this should be the view of such as ex-Senator
Burton	PERSON	is perhaps to be ex - pected , and not particularly to be regretted , but when we find it put forth in an article in support of the
League	ORGANIZATION	appearing in the Outlook , and ad - dressed to the semi-religious middle-class public whom that magazine serves , it is a cause of appre - hension . ''


Germany	LOCATION	is not yet beaten but just placed in a position where she can be beaten and she must be kept there by an army of occupation un - til her ultimate defeat is assured . ''

		And again : ''
Germany	LOCATION	is still the enemy of the free nations of the world . ''

		All this shows that the Outlook is defending the Covenant under a complete miscon - ception of its spirit and purpose .

		The
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	without
Germany	LOCATION	is no association in the sense in which President
Wilson	PERSON	used the term in the last of his famous fourteen articles .

		It is on the contrary a perpetuation of an alliance which will be faced at first by a single nation , as
Europe	LOCATION	by
Prussia	LOCATION	in
1806	DATE	, then by a rival alliance , one which in view of its exclusion from the world of international finance will be what our press calls Bolshevik , and which will in consequence attract the admiration of labor everywhere and be in a position to carry the class war into every country of the world .

		No a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	without
Germany	LOCATION	is the surest way of defeating the object of such a league .

		The great problem is indeed the making of a peace with
Germany	LOCATION	by virtue of which she will recognize the Covenant as the child of President
Wilson	PERSON	's idealism , and be eager to adopt and defend the faith .

		It should be said at once and with all solemnity that the terms of peace of - fered to
Germany	LOCATION	in connection with the Covenant are the last opportunity to reestablish the world on its old foundations .

		Already the treatment of Ger - .

		many by the Allies has seriously compromised the situation .

		It may be said with truth that the bit - terness , the legacy of hate , of the last four months is greater than that of the four years of war .

		On the one hand the political and financial exigencies of the Allied statesmen have led to an intensifica - tion of the verbal campaign against
Germany	LOCATION	, with a consequent accretion of wrath among their peoples ; and on the other , the severity of the Armis - tice and the blockade has extended and increased the hardships of war conditions among the civil population of
Germany	LOCATION	until it appears that one reason why
Lloyd George	PERSON	urges the granting of food is that his army of occupation will not endure longer the sight of women and children dying of starvation .

		It should be remembered that the long years of hate and distrust between North and South that followed our own Civil War were the product of the so-called Reconstruction rather than of the war itself .

		It will be so in this case unless full advantage is taken of the means of reconciliation afforded by the
Treaty of Peace	ORGANIZATION	based on the Covenant .

		We quote the words of
Norman Angell	PERSON	in hisi article in this issue of THE DIAL : The success of the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	will depend less now upon the form of machinery which the Allies may devise than whether the spirit which must animate any successful League is imported into their actual policy to - wards the enemy during the next months .

		\ _ / NE OF THE CHIEF OBSTACLES IN THE WAY OF a genuine and enduring peace with
Germany	LOCATION	a peace of the spirit as well as of the flesh is the un - satisfactory attitude of that country in the matter of repentance .

		Our press reminds us daily that at heart the Germans are as world-defying as ever .

		They are glum in the presence of our soldiers and exhibit unbecoming joy at the return of their own , to whom they apply the term heroes as undis - criminatingly as we do to ours .

		What signs of re - morse our experts in national conscience demand is difficult to discover .

		It has been suggested that the ninety-three professors publicly recant and with - draw their pronouncement that the
Ebert	LOCATION	govern - ment publish a White Book confessing
Germany	LOCATION	's 310 THE DIAL
March 22	DATE	responsibility for beginning the war that the clergy lead their flocks in penance .

		None of these things will happen .

		If we are waiting for them as pre - liminary to peace with
Germany	LOCATION	, we shall not have that peace .

		In fact it may be questioned whether modern history records a genuine case of national repentance .

		It is true that in times when the na - tion was a unit not far removed from a patriarchal society , it could doubtless feel as a single family in the presence of national sin and misfortune : there is no reason to doubt the psychological truth of the Old Testament accounts of the repentance of the Hebrew people under the scourge of their prophets .

		Again , in the city states ,
Athens	LOCATION	and
Florence	LOCATION	, it was possible for similar unity of feel - ing to take effect in great movements of civic emotion .

		But in a modern state , as in a modern corporation , the sense of responsibility is so diffused , the means of information so indirect and uncertain , that it is impossible to focus national feeling on any - thing so unpleasant as a conviction of sin .

		We know this from our own history .

		It is well estab - lished that the Spanish War was diplomatically avoidable that President
McKinley	PERSON	yielded to the popular blood thirst excited by
Roosevelt	PERSON	and
Hearst	ORGANIZATION	.

		It may be thought that no subject of re - pentance is more compelling than a needless war ; yet has the
United States	LOCATION	or its body of citizens felt anything approaching regret for the bloodshed ?

		It is equally well established that in setting up the republic of
Panama	LOCATION	we made a scrap of paper of a treaty with
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	explicitly covering the subject of our aggression , and that if
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	had resisted we !

		should have invaded her territory .

		Yet nothing is farther from our national conscience than a sense of wrongdoing .

		If we confess , as
Roose	PERSON	- velt did , it is with pride .

		The efforts of a few well-meaning idealists to make us pay damage are the cause in our
Senate	ORGANIZATION	of renewed hardness of heart or ribald contempt of the law of nations and the people care for none of these things .

		But it may be said that
Germany	LOCATION	's offense was accom - panied by circumstances of outrage and atrocity that should bring an instinctive recoil .

		Did simi - lar atrocities when perpetrated by our soldiers in the
Philippines	LOCATION	cause any noticeable mental or moral anguish in - this country ?

		Yes to Mr.
Moorfield Story	ORGANIZATION	and a few other belated Puritans .

		The trouble was that they could not bring to the coun - try any lively conception of its responsibility for the behavior of its servants toward an inferior race .

		And probably the German people today are in the same condition of mingled ignorance , disbelief , and indif - ference in regard to
Belgium	LOCATION	.

		We need not look for any great act of national repentance from Ger - many , for none is possible .

		In view of
Germany	LOCATION	's defeat such an act would be in any case discounted .

		So it behooves us to remake our world as best we can , without the edifying and gratifying spectacle of
Germany	LOCATION	on her knees in public penance .

		T , HE
OVERMAN	PERSON	COMMITTEE MARKED THE climax of its deliberations with the appearance of Colonel
Raymond Robins	PERSON	.

		The investigation di - rected by the
State Department	ORGANIZATION	as a smoke screen for its blunders in the Russian situation was care - fully planned to include only the testimony of those violently opposed to the present regime in
Russia	LOCATION	, with a final explosion from the Reds to damn it with loud praise .

		It was expected that in this way the Soviet Government would be discredited from both sides , and the natural reaction of the country would be a disgust so deep that the record of the
State Department	ORGANIZATION	would be drowned in it .

		The failure of the plan was due largely to the modera - _ tion and good sense with which Messrs.
John Reed	PERSON	and
Albert Rhys Williams	PERSON	and Miss
Louise Bryant	PERSON	conducted themselves before the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	.

		A sen - atorial investigation is nowadays much like the Indian custom of running the gauntlet .

		The war - riors line up on either side , spitting on their hands and waving their clubs with ferocious gestures , grimaces , and cries , each eager to plant a blow that will echo down the ages in the Congressional Rec - ord .

		In the case of favored prisoners who are destined to adoption into the tribe , the warriors are directed to strike just before or after the flying figure .

		In the case of
Breshkovskaya	LOCATION	, who was sup - posed to be persona grata , some over-eager young braves , excited doubtless by the term '' revolution - ist , '' struck to wound , but were called off .

		In the cases of the sympathizers with the Soviets , however , no quarter was given , and
Miss Bryant	PERSON	in particular was subjected to the peculiar type of courtesy which Senators retain for use towards their masters the people .

		In spite of this , the testimony of the avowed sympathizers with the Soviets was such as to con - vict the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	and the
State Department	ORGANIZATION	of the panic cry of ''
Wolf	PERSON	!

		Wolf ! ''

		It was not ap - parently the intention to call
Colonel Robins	PERSON	; but his own expressed desire to make his long awaited statement before this official body , and the demand of ` the Truth about
Russia Society	ORGANIZATION	, forced the hand of the
State Department	ORGANIZATION	, which professed to be man - aging the investigation , and resulted in the exten - sion of its hearings .

		Colonel
Robins	PERSON	effectively disposed of any value the investigation might have as camouflage for the mistakes of the
Administration	ORGANIZATION	in dealing with
Russia	LOCATION	.

		Blunders that became atroc - ities were noted and catalogued in his testimony , to become a part of the final indictment .

		The sending of the most notorious representative of the
Dark Forces of America	ORGANIZATION	to greet Revolutionary
Russia	LOCATION	, the selfish sacrifice of the
Kerensky Government	ORGANIZATION	, the cowardly refusal to give an answer to
Lenin	ORGANIZATION	's offer to break off negotiations at Brest-Litovsk in re - turn for aid all these stand forth in Colonel
Rob	PERSON	- ins ' testimony as monuments to the arrogant stupid - ity that has characterized our
State Department	ORGANIZATION	, to whose best traditions the present locum tenens is not unfaithful .

		Colonel
Robins	PERSON	refused comment
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 3 11 on the
Sisson	PERSON	documents , which , he said according to the report in the
New York	LOCATION	Tribune '' would inevitably reflect on Mr.
Sisson	PERSON	, who is abroad . ''

		He expressed disbelief in many of the stories of violence and terror circulated in the campaign of propaganda against the Soviet Government , espe - cially the picturesque tale of the violation of the Woman 's Battalion .

		In reply to questions as to the danger of Bolshevism in
America	LOCATION	Colonel
Robins	PERSON	declared that there were two remedies full publicity as to
Russia	LOCATION	and full protection of the American workman , '' so that he will say that the land that is worth living in is a land worth living for . ''

		V_JpposED TO COLONEL ROBINS IN THE TREAT - ment of social unrest stand forth certain champions of strong-arm methods .

		There is Governor
Sproul	PERSON	of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, addressing the Scotch-Irish So - ciety of that state : I do n't believe we are in any danger .

		I do n't believe that any doctrine which controverts our religion or the God we believe in will get any status in
America	LOCATION	.

		Any - one who wants to start trouble in
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	will get it .

		The state has an organization to beat any attempt to disturb the present order of things .

		There is Mayor
Ole Hanson	PERSON	of
Seattle	LOCATION	, and his Chief of Police : `` We closed up every ` wobbly ' hall in town , '' said the Mayor .

		`` We did n't have any law to do it with , so we used nails .

		When there was serious opposition we trotted out tiie
Department of Health	ORGANIZATION	and had the build - ings condemned .

		We did n't need any more law than we did to stop the red flag .

		We just stopped it . ''

		In reference to a raid in which the police searched the cooperative market run by union labor , closed and padlocked the headquarters of the
Socialist Party	ORGANIZATION	, and stopped w `` brk at a cooperative shop where
I. W. W.	PERSON	literature had been printed , the Chief of Police said : I had no warrant ordering the place closed .

		I was tired of reading the revolutionary circulars that were printed there , and decided that I had already let them go too far , so I just locked them up .

		They started with very mild articles , but have now passed the limit .

		I expect no trouble in enforcing the closing order .

		In
Lawrence	LOCATION	,
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, where the textile workers are striking for the eight-hour day , the po - lice have refused the strikers the exercise of their right of peaceful assembly , have arrested a strike leader on the false charge of evading the draft , have ridden down and beaten up peaceful strikers and their sympathizers on the public streets and side - walks .

		In the case of the Lawrence strike the forces of repression are drawing on the hatred generated and stored up for war purposes .

		They are mak - ing lavish use of the shibboleths of patriotism and religion , utterly reckless as to the effect of discredit - ing forever among hungry and desperate men the faiths for which the catchwords stand .

		.

		HE GOVERNMENT CONTINUES ITS BLUNDERING policy in regard to the victims of war psychology .

		Ex-Attorney General
Gregory	PERSON	continues to main - tain that persons convicted under the Espionage Act are not political prisoners , and that in every case it was proved that whatever they said or did was done with a specific unlawful intent , even w r hen the prosecution arose from statements made in pri - vate conversation .

		His own recommendation of commutation of sentences recognizes that in some cases the evidence of unlawful intent was unsatis - factory , and further that '' injustice resulted to cer - tain defendants because of the all-prevalent condi - tion of intense patriotism and aroused emotions on the part of the jurors . ''

		It is pertinent to ask Mr.
Gregory	PERSON	whether this condition did not result in injustice not in some cases but in all , and whether he and his subordinates did not make every effort to inflame the patriotic passions of courts and juries against defendants and thus become themselves the cause of the injustice which Mr.
Gregory	PERSON	now tardily condemns .

		The cases recently reported for clemency illustrate and emphasize the inequality with which the law was enforced .

		Convicts who at - tracted much public sympathy even when convicted of publicly ' urging resistance to conscription are to be released .

		Others like
Robert Goldstein	PERSON	, con - victed for promoting a moving picture showing mas - sacres by British soldiers in the American Revolu - tion , are held to three years .

		The statement that he is '' alleged to have been financed by pro-German interests '' is an interesting comment on what the
Department of Justice	ORGANIZATION	holds to be material evidence in such cases .

		.

		HE SAME SHUFFLING AND EVASIVE POLICY IS continued toward the Conscientious Objectors .

		Late in
January	DATE	the Secretary of War released 113 Ob - jectors from
Fort Leavenworth	LOCATION	men who had been courtmartialled without having been granted , or in some cases offered , the '' farm furloughs offi - cially promised .

		Freedom seems to have been ex - tended only to the men who declared that they would have accepted such alternative service had it been offered .

		Absolutists whose consciences revolted at every direct or indirect form of submission to conscription for war are left , presumably , to serve out their sentences .

		In other words , the War De - partment offers the temptation to these men to deny their consciences and impeach their own sincerity .

		By so doing it cuts from under its own feqt the only ground on which its practice can be defended .

		For it is obvious that the only ground on which conscientious objectors are entitled to escape facing the firing squad is that of conscience .

		All compro - mise , evasion , and paltering with this issue are ab - surd and must ultimately be abandoned .

		If the
Sec	ORGANIZATION	- retary of War felt that such courses were useful in time of war he can have no excuse for maintaining them in peace .

Alexan	PERSON	-
der Teixeira de Mattos	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dodd ,
Mead	LOCATION	;
$ 1.75	MONEY	.

		The Burgomaster of Stilemonde is written by the
Maeterlinck	PERSON	who wrote
Monna Vanna	PERSON	and
Mary Magdalene	PERSON	, a
Maeterlinck	ORGANIZATION	who approaches moral problems with some objectivity .

		He has lost his coloring and poetry , but perhaps that is a fitting loss in a play of the recent war .

		Instead however of a grim , stark , bleeding piece of artistry , he has given us merely a workmanlike play in which plausible beings repeat declarations familiar for the past four years .

		One might say the conflict in the play is between the two
Mythologies of Power	ORGANIZATION	and of Sacrifice : in Nietzschean terms , between the proud , relentless , strong , '' well-constituted , '' and the self-sacrificing and loving '' ill-constituted . ''


John Cowper Powys	PERSON	in his novel Wood and Stone took this antagonism , handled it with an ironic searching grasp , and posed in a hundred ways the question as to which after all were really the stronger , the power-seeking ones or the loving ones .


Maeterlinck	PERSON	has treated the theme almost as
Pinero	PERSON	might do it .

		The play ends in the execution of the
Burgo	LOCATION	- master , who gives his life to save his head gardener and his town from German violence .

		By many wordy speeches
Maeterlinck	PERSON	shows us the incom - prehensibility , to the invading military leaders , of such actions and of Belgian resistance .

		Major von
Rochow	PERSON	stands for absolute Prussian militarism , while the young Lieutenant
Hilmer	PERSON	is intended to show us '' a very pleasant , good-hearted fellow , very kind , clever , too , '' who is warped into a different man by taking his place as a small cog in a vast army machine .

		The tragic note is intensified by
Kilmer	PERSON	's relation to the Burgomaster as his son-in-law and by the distraction of his wife
Isabelle	PERSON	, who forbids
Hil	PERSON	- mer to touch her after the Burgomaster has been shot . ''

		This is incomprehensible , '' says Major von
Rochow	PERSON	, '' but they 're all more or less mad in this country . ''


Maeterlinck	PERSON	's restraint is evident throughout .

		In his desire to avoid too bitter rancor , too great pas - sion , the play has lost something life-giving .

		Future readers in studying the collected works will pass quickly over the Burgomaster of Stilemonde .

		THE WAY OF A MAN .

		By
Thomas Dixon	PERSON	.

		Appleton ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Could any person not of essentially unclean mind have written
Thomas Dixon	PERSON	's latest atrocity , The Way of a Man ?

		If the book possessed merit as literature it would be barred from libraries , but it is so worthless as to be safe from attack .

		The once-Reverend
Thomas Dixon	PERSON	would doubtless plead that he is teaching a moral lesson , but the plea would not stand : he writes with too obvious relish in his pornographic material ; his pen revels in an eroticism that offends doubly because of its crudity .

		Mr.
Dixon	PERSON	is a sensation-monger , know - ing only the vulgarly violent emotions , striving always to lash the reader into some state of passion .

		Having exhausted the possibilities of race prejudice in the South , he now gives over his efforts to stir up mob violence against the Negroes for conditions that existed if ever more than fifty years ago , and spatters the North with his highly colored ink .

		The South is to be congratulated on his removal .

		In this book he undertakes to furnish an expose of free love in lower
Manhattan	LOCATION	.

		Bis style is no less absurd than his plot , 2nd both show the influence of nis experience in scenario writing .

		Violent and luscious adjectives pursue each other across the page , '' where mechanical emotions rumble along through a pasteboard world to their stereotyped conclusions .

		TAM o ' THE SCOOTS .

		By
Edgar Wallace	PERSON	.

		Small ,
Maynard	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 1.35	MONEY	.

		Mr.
Wallace	PERSON	, in Tarn o ' the Scoots , reflects les chansons de gloire that colored the life of flyers in the late war .

		More , he reflects the bright spirit of chivalry that marked the aerial lists .

		Tarn shot down a great rival , and the next day attended his funeral at some altitude , dropping a noble epitaph in verse .

		Later ,
Tarn	ORGANIZATION	shot down another one of the enemy in flames , but the man escaped death ; and , while being feasted before going into formal captivity , he praised the poetry of the little epitaph .

		Tam flushed .

		up . ''

		Thank ye , sir-r , '' he blurted . ''

		Ye couldna ' ` a ' made me more pleased even if A ' killit ye . ''

		An excellent touch , that ; for the episodes of the high tourney always were funny to the flyers , much in the mood of an Icarian bur - lesque .

		And if any were killed , the play became , for the moment , serious .

		Also , it should be noted , Mr.
Wallace	PERSON	reflects this happy spirit of the air - men by the employment of a lively and entertaining narrative of adventure .

		Many things happen in a page , and very quickly too .

		Tam is the gentle apotheosis of the blood-and-thunder hero , and some - thing besides .

		If the reader asks more , it will be an echo of that unph rased deep pathos that just touched the faces of these modern knights when , the day done , they sat down to mess , marked an - other vacant chair , and raised their glasses in a silent toast .

		But the flyers themselves , in reading this book , will find not a few technical errors of the sort that a writer would make .

		It is a sorry thing to point them out in such good narrative .

		And yet , because the same errors may be published again , it is just as well to set a clarifying finger on the confused illustration facing page 52 .

		The gun in the illustration could never be used in the air .

		It has a cooling device which is unnecessary , and a IQI9 THE DIAL belt feed which would knock out the pilot 's eyes , at least .

		It has no sights .

		The trigger squeeze is so antiquated for a pilot 's gun that it would be useless in combat .

		The pilot 's goggles are raised , and climactic error both hands are removed from the controls .

		The plane to which the gun is at - tached was evidently invented by the illustrator .

		It would never fly .

		ASIA MINOR .

		By
Walter A. Hawley	PERSON	.

		John Lane ;
$ 3.50	MONEY	.

		It is hard to condemn a man because he lacks imagination .

		But in the last analysis any criticism of Mr.
Hawley	PERSON	's
Asia	LOCATION	Minor must come down to that .

		If careful observation were all , if a meticulous transcribing of things seen sufficed to give a true picture of the unexplored , the volume would pass the censor .

		Unfortunately , much of the significance of the
East	LOCATION	, as indeed of all places where we are minded to look for it , consists in the things that are not visible .

		And Mr.
Hawley	PERSON	is neither prophet nor seer , but simply a traveler with a zest for dis - tant lands , a deep-felt appreciation for antiquities and landscapes , and some very considerable knowl - edge of the ancient races that have successively inhabited his bit of the
East	LOCATION	, from the square-toed Hittites up .

		He can be counted on not to make mis - statements or blunders .

		But such a writer as
H. G. Dwight	PERSON	will give more of the
East	LOCATION	in the turn of a phrase than can be found in all the present volume together .

		To the description of a country richer in association , in mystery , and dawning power than almost any other spot of the globe , he brings obser - vation , but little perception of the fundamental and living questions at stake .

		Hence he offers worn banalities , comfortless assurances , or positive mis - conceptions such as his assertion that '' despite abuses perpetrated by the
Government	ORGANIZATION	, the Turks have many excellent qualities , some of which have been manifest during the
last two decades	DATE	in the serious efforts of the
Progressive Party	ORGANIZATION	to accom - plish necessary reforms . ''

		Is Mr.
Hawley	PERSON	really unacquainted with history since the inauguration of the
Young Turk Administration	ORGANIZATION	?

		He has given us an interesting
Baedeker of Asia Minor	ORGANIZATION	, but he has certainly missed a priceless opportunity .

		THE MIRROR AND THE LAMP .


W. B. Max	PERSON	- well .

		Bobbs-Merrill ;
$ 1.75	MONEY	.

		Mr.
Maxwell	PERSON	, novelist , has given place for four years to Captain
Maxwell	PERSON	of the
British Army	ORGANIZATION	, righting with the
Fusiliers	ORGANIZATION	in
France	LOCATION	.

		The war however has no part in his new novel , in which the struggles are all mental and spiritual .

		He says of his title : The lamp is one 's inmost self what we call the soul the mirror is the mind .

		The lamp is constant in its power to light the mirror , and show what is fair and what is foul .

		In this book , which is in some respects the best thing he has done , Mr.
Maxwell	PERSON	repeats the themes of his previous novels man 's craving for religion , the contrast between wealth and poverty , and the effects upon character of unlawful love .

		He han - dles these essentially difficult subjects with sincerity and admirable delicacy .

		His description of char - acter is excellent in the case of the minor persons , but the major persons do not convince .


Edward Churchill	PERSON	, the central figure , never succeeds in gain - ing the reader 's belief in him nor sympathy with him .

		He alone of the family group in his childhood home is unconvincing .

		The mother is extremely real , detestably so , and the brothers are alive .

		Even the old servant ,
Maria	LOCATION	, and the various boys at school are actual particularly the tragic
Jarvis	PERSON	, he of the graveyard cough with which he entertains his fel - lows , until the day when he has to go to work in a shop and becomes the victim of the boys ' cruel caste snobbery .

		And
Walsden	PERSON	, the ^ missionary , is one of the most authentic persons in recent fiction .

		But
Churchill	PERSON	is a prig in his boyhood and a weak - ling in manhood .

		His religion never seems vital , as
Walsden	PERSON	's is , and his vacillations about the min - istry lack sufficient motivation .

		He puts belief off and on too easily .

		He shows inherent weakness in letting himself be so dominated by his piously crafty mother , as well as in the entanglement of his later life .

		The author obviously expects the reader 's approval , or at least sympathy , in
Churchill	LOCATION	's elope - ment with a married woman and his subsequent life with her , but the whole affair appears unreal .

		-LRB- Why is Mr.
Maxwell	PERSON	always writing about the woman who transgresses the moral law ? -RRB-

		Lillian is a poor thing , not worth the sacrifice Churchill made for her .

		The story is huddled together at the last , so that the closing events appear dreamlike .

		And the final chapters are a sop to the happy-ender .

		THE OPEN-AIR THEATRE .

		By
Sheldon Cheney	PERSON	.

		Kennerley ;
$ 3	MONEY	.

		The virtues of open air do not require proof ; they are axiomatic .

		And we are not certain but that over-insistence upon them has a tendency to weaken rather than strengthen their position .

		There is always a temptation for the compiler to turn special pleader , and that appears to be the trap into which the author of this handbook has fallen on more than one occasion .

		He is led into a dog - matic assertiveness which warps the fabric of his theme .

		By claiming too much for the al fresco drama he imparts the impression that there < is some special baneful influence residing in mere roof .

		We find him requisitioning italics to remark : '' If there is one quality that , more than any other , distinguishes the drama of the open from the indoor drama , it is genuineness . '' ''

		The story of the birth of dramatic art , and of that art 's growth through its greatest eras , is exclusively the story of the open - air theater , '' he says elsewhere .

		And when we find Mr.
Cheney	PERSON	claiming for the Cranbrook theatei , THE DIAL
March 22	DATE	near
Detroit	LOCATION	, that '' the whole effect has a loveliness without parallel in the existing theatres of ancient or modern times , '' we have a lurking conviction that the author is taking in a little too much terri - tory .

		For the most part , however , the compiler con - tents himself with a lucid textual description of the open-air theater of this country and
Europe	LOCATION	, giving an adequate idea of their styles and the kind of production to which they are adapted .

		The book is comprehensive , and contains more than half a hundred excellent illustrations .

		There is an ap - pendix devoted more particularly to problems of planning and construction .

		SINISTER HOUSE .

		By
Leland Hall	PERSON	.


Hough	PERSON	- ton
Mifflin	LOCATION	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Of course we do n't believe in ghosts .

		Reason , science , even simple decorum of everyday life all combine against such belief .

		Yet there exists in hardheaded as well as in imaginative folk a sub - stratum of credulity needing only to be tapped .

		Some skill is necessary to drop through the layers of sophisticated resistance into that substratum .

		We demand competent witnesses , people who are not flighty ordinary , good , sensible people .

		We like the evidence of animals , dogs especially , for we do not suspect them of conniving to fool us .

		We need motivation for the ghosts : why are they haunting the cattle ?

		We find it easier , on the whole , to accept malevolent spirits than gentle , well-mean - ing ones .

		Perhaps never since the Turn of the Screw have ghosts been evoked so successfully as in
Sinister House	ORGANIZATION	.

		The narrator of the story is a commuter with a
Ford	ORGANIZATION	, living in a new concrete house .

		His wife ,
Annette	PERSON	, is plump , pretty , and skeptical enough to remove any suspicion of connivance .


Giles Farrow	PERSON	,
Annette	PERSON	's artist cousin , supplies the element of intellectual doubt .

		Eric and Julia'Grier , who live in the dark house high over the river , are from the first comment intriguing characters ,
Julia	PERSON	with her fine courage and her intense love for
Eric	PERSON	,
Eric	PERSON	, with his restless , over-protective passion for his wife .

		The story is like an enlarging spiral of mystery and terror , with scenes of steadily heightening dra - matic quality until the final terrifying night of the disclosure .


Giles	PERSON	, firm in his belief that ghosts breed only in the living , works toward the disclosure of some tangible cause in
Eric	PERSON	's past for the terror of his present life .

		And terror it is , malevolent and horrid , driving
Eric	PERSON	into isolation by repelling his friends , making him frightful to children , be - setting
Julia	PERSON	to the point of death .

		Mr.
Hall	PERSON	understands the artistic value of con - trasts in building up his atmosphere .

		Days of bright autumn sun and family picnics precede nights that are black with great winds blowing .

		Com - fortable fires and pleasant food and then ghostly fingers at one 's neck .

		The style is manipulated toward this same end :
Pierre Smith	PERSON	, the narrator , talks in commonplace colloquialisms , except at the high moments of the story ; there the colloquialisms give place to clear , distinct , sometimes powerful phrasing .

		MEMORIES GRAVE AND GAY .

		By
Florence Howe Hall	ORGANIZATION	.

		Harper ;
$ 3.50	MONEY	.

		LETTERS OF
SUSAN HALE	PERSON	.

		Edited by
Caro	PERSON	- line
P. Atkinson	PERSON	.

		Marshall Jones ;
$ 3.50	MONEY	.

		The strongest reaction aroused by Memories Grave and Gay is acute sympathy for Mrs.
Julia Ward Howe	PERSON	and her worthy husband , Dr.
Samuel Gridley Howe	PERSON	.

		In their day and generation they must have been a vigorous , enterprising pair .

		The Battle Hymn of the Republic and the Asylum for the Blind are first-class products .

		Fighting for the right of women to work outside their own families and for Greek independence meant a thoroughgoing passion for reform seventy or eighty years ago .

		It was to the
Howes	PERSON	that
Florence Nightingale	ORGANIZATION	looked for moral support in the unheard-of adventure of hospital nursing in the eighteen-fifties , and it was in the
Howes	PERSON	' Dorchester home ,
Green Peace	ORGANIZATION	, that many a European revolutionist and exile found welcome .

		But that was very long ago , and this famous couple have been unfortunate in their de - scendants .

		Instead of going forward to blaze new - trails in the manner of their father and mother , the
Howes	PERSON	of today seem to prefer to stay at home and indulge in the worship of their ancestors .

		The library catalogues show lives of each parent sepa - rately , another of both parents together , besides endless special chapters and magazine articles ; and now comes this new record of family history a last , careful , patient gleaning in a field w T hence many solid volumes had already been harvested .

		Wonderful it is under such circumstances that Mrs.
Florence Howe Hall	PERSON	has found anything new or interesting to relate .

		She has but the difficulty is that the new parts are not interesting , and the interesing parts are not new .

		We have heard before of the education of
Laura Bridgeman	PERSON	, and we do not care to hear how young
Harry Hall	PERSON	first learned - to ride a bicycle .

		Still , quite apart from the value of the material , the book has a charm and distinction of its own .

		An atmosphere of the '' divine right of kings '' per - vades it .

		A serene confidence surrounds it like a halo .

		Without humor , without hurry , without selection , without the faintest shadow of a suspi - cion of the devout interest of her public , every least detail of the doings of the
Howe	PERSON	family is set down , to the third and fourth generation .

		The chronicle is childlike , almost pathetic in its simple-hearted - ness .

		We could go on forever in admiration of this perfect specimen of ancestor worship , if we were not brought up short again by our sharp sympathy

Boston	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	316 THE DIAL
March 22	DATE	for Mrs.
Julia Ward Howe	PERSON	.

		In life she was a clever woman , more than ordinarily vivid and human : it is hard that she has not been allowed , naturally and gently , to fade into obscurity .

		It is hard not to be allowed to die a natural death .

		The refreshing thing about The Letters of
Susan Hale	PERSON	is that she does not take herself seriously neither herself nor her family .

		She paints in
Paris	LOCATION	studios ; she sketches on the Nile ; she acts charades in half the back parlors of
Boston	LOCATION	; she teaches school ; she jobs at literary hack work for her brother ; she is responsible for a respectable row of volumes herself ; she dissects the flora cf Matu - nuck ,
Rhode Island	LOCATION	; she lectures at Woman 's Clubs , east and west and everywhere .

		But none of these occupations takes the center of the stage , or diverts her from her true profession of having a perfectly beautiful time in the world .

		Let us frankly call her what she was , an amateur and un - ashamed .

		Letter writing however , as we find to our good fortune in the present volume , she did take seri - ously .

		A nephew once said of her , '' Why , I could write good letters , too , if I sat down to it right after breakfast and kept it up the whole morning . ''

		Being a friend to all sorts of conditions and ages of men amounted with
Miss Hale	PERSON	to a career in itself .

		In her letters of travel her greater enthusiasms were for the people , not the places .

		Europe becomes almost a '' suburb of
Boston	LOCATION	, '' where she is con - tinually running into somebody 's sister , or cousin , or aunt .

		In
Paris	LOCATION	her chief adventure was break - fasting with
James Russell Lowell	PERSON	.

		But already , and very swiftly , these letters of Miss
Susan Hale	PERSON	's are taking on the aroma and fragrance of the old-fashioned .

		Her travels abroad belong to the long ago , ante-bellum period when
Europe	LOCATION	was to most of us blessedly a huge , de - lightful , colored picture-book of romance .

		The porcelain stoves of
Germany	LOCATION	, the Pyramids of
Egypt	LOCATION	were only parts of an amusing , enchanting Foreign Whole .

		Those were the days before we had seen It come alive and turn twice as real as
Boston	LOCATION	Common or the
State House	ORGANIZATION	.

		In these days of doubt and difficulty , then , all lovers of let - ters will find it doubly refreshing to turn over these records of irresponsible good times in the old world .

		THE SPINNERS .

		Macmillan ;
$ 1.60	MONEY	.

		By
Eden Phillpotts	PERSON	.

		In The
Spinners Eden Phillpotts	ORGANIZATION	shows the working of the old eternal forces in a modern community .

		The scene is an idyllic landscape of chalk downs , winding rivers , and cottage gardens overflowing with flowers , such as are to be found only in the
West Country of England	LOCATION	.

		The dramatis personae are the folk of the spinning mill which is owned by
Raymond Ironsyde	PERSON	.

		Among them , all three Fates were to be seen at their ancient business . ''

		Clotho attended to the
Spread Board	ORGANIZATION	; the can-minders , coiling away the sliver , stood for Lachesis ; while in the spinners , who cut the thread when the bobbin was full ,
Estelle	PERSON	found Atropos , the goddess of the shears . ''

		The tragedy of the story is due to the world-old situation of a wronged girl whose love has turned to hate .

		Her bitterness and her lover 's faithlessness find their nemesis in the unbalanced nature of their son , who is the victim and the instrument of Fate .

		A theme so threadbare as this needs to be given a very special treatment or to be presented from a very unusual angle in order to hold the interest of the reader , and one does not find that treatment or that angle in this book .

		True , a modern note is struck in the consideration of such subjects as the demands of labor , and the position of women in industry , but that does not compensate for the very obvious lack of originality .

		The most pleas - ing point in the book is the recognition of the ro - mance that is to be found in machinery and the actual esthetic pleasure that is to be derived from it .

		As a dispassionate study of cause and effect , which are shown with much psychological con - scientiousness , this story has a certain value ; it is true to life also in the fact that , although the char - acterization is firm and convincing , none of the characters stand out very vividly from the group to which they belong .

		The book is lightened by touches of delicious , almost Dickensian , hiftnor , but it does not equal either in its comedy or in its tragedy some of
Eden Phillpotts	ORGANIZATION	' earlier work , and there are some who might almost consider it dull as depressingly dull as English country life itself can be at certain seasons of the year .

		EDGEWATER PEOPLE .

		By
Mary E. Wilkins Freeman	PERSON	.

		Harper :
$ 1.35	MONEY	.


Edgewater People	ORGANIZATION	portrays the
New England	LOCATION	temperament continuing to dominate the life of four villages , offshoots of the parent town .

		The tempera - ment , in its inarticulate intensities , is shown in various forms of pride , cherished loves and hates , the yearning of lonely souls for affection , self-seek - ing , the passion for nature , the fighting spirit , and brooding remorse .

		The cumulative effect , in spite of the conventional happy ending and a buoyant morality , is rather grim , and is emphasized by the simplicity of the types , the author 's own frankness , and an uncompromising directness , almost abrupt - ness of style .

		Humor is absent also from several of the sketches , though the best are pervaded by an irony inherent in the situation , as in the predicament of the youth returned from a traveling show to find himself , because of his mother 's deception , posing as a hero of the trenches .

		After themes of domestic estrangement and recon - ciliation , the yearning of the spinster , the child 's mission of regeneration and the acerbities of decayed gentlewomen , the reader welcomes the fresher

		POSTAGE EXTRA 3 i8 THE DIAL
March 22	DATE	motive of the sea captain 's pride of proprietorship in the sea .

		Ingenuity of situation and incident is il - lustrated in the Odyssean variation on the prodigal son , who , unrecognized by any of his family except his mother , rehabilitates his father 's country store , and satisfies poetic justice by feeding the pig .

		In - one instance , at least , the idiosyncrasy of plot strains credulity , when the morbid wife proves her daughter - in-law by the same fantastic and fiery trial of love to which she herself succumbed .

		Mingled with the types who embody more or less humanly the rage of the devouring temperament are dispositions hap - pily lower-pitched , as that of the self-forgetful , clear - eyed , and resourceful
Lizzie Jordan	PERSON	, whose homely common sense is the best philosophy : `` Well , I know what I have to put up with livin ' with
Sophia Ludd	PERSON	, but I was kind of in the dark about Adela Dyce . ''

		On the whole the reader is fain to reflect that even old age and celibacy in an
New England	LOCATION	village are conscious at their most expansive of a lighter and more superficial vein , and that the
New England	LOCATION	temperament may presently be constrained to sur - render its last stronghold to the insidious invasion of cosmopolitanism .

		BYWAYS IN
SOUTHERN TUSCANY	LOCATION	.

		By
Kath	PERSON	- arine
Hooker	PERSON	.

		Scribner ;
$ 3.50	MONEY	.

		If ever a country could be likened to the pitcher of
Philemon	PERSON	and
Baucis	PERSON	, that country is
Italy	LOCATION	.

		The centuries pass in vain the flow of books on the beloved land continues steadily .

		This latest one by
Katharine Hooker	PERSON	is not from so mighty a pen as some which have written of Italian journeys , but it is a good and likable work which gives us sketches of many a little town that one would scarcely know where to read about otherwise unless one had access to a good library of Italian .

		Even then one would miss the particular sort of delight that a country affords to a foreigner quite a different matter from the associations and the pride awakened in a native .

		The author 's appreciation of the Latin grace and sweetness of the simple people she meets in the country and the little cities makes up to the reader for the regret he will feel at having cleanliness or the lack of it noted so diligently at almost every place to which he is conducted .

		Such entrancing places really out of the way , and not to be seen by those who confine their travel to railway carriages !

		Fine old legends cluster about even finer old ruins ; pas - sages from
Dante	ORGANIZATION	come to lips , or perhaps fall from lips , that speak them with the purity of the Sienese territory , which today has something in its speech akin to that of the poet .

		The travels of the party -LRB- which included a pho - tographer with an eye for lovely scenes witness the illustrations -RRB- extend westward from
Siena	LOCATION	, along the
Maremma	ORGANIZATION	, as far as the
Campagna	PERSON	and
Umbria	LOCATION	.

		to the south and east , and stop short of
Arezzo	LOCATION	again at the north , lest so great and famous a place take one out of the Byways which it is the book 's purpose to describe .

		Having journeyed to
Massa Marittima	PERSON	, however , it may be that one missed a page on the great altar - piece there by
Lorenzetti	PERSON	, or even a reproduction of it .

		Pazienza !

		there is enough in this corner of the inexhaustible
Italy	LOCATION	to make good the loss many times over , with marshes and mountains , brigands and blessed bells , saints and signoroni and sunshine .

		This frank study of modern warfare and its effect on the artistic temperament is one of the war 's authentic contributions to literature .

		The humors of

60 cents	MONEY	-RRB- have been left behind by the march of events .

		To read about the difficulties of war-time diet in
London	LOCATION	and
Paris	LOCATION	at this date is to force oneself to a reminiscent relish a mood which is not facilely attained , and which Mr.
Cobb	PERSON	does too little to foster .

		The

		The present volume
London	LOCATION	and Its Environs -LRB-
$ 4.50	MONEY	-RRB- is by
Findlay Muirhead	PERSON	, some time an editor in the house of
Baedeker	LOCATION	.

		It is most completely got up and includes a convenient detachable appendix of street maps and data about transportation .

		Best of all , the preface is happily free from wartime rancor .

		The French edition of the Blue Guides is in the hands of
Hachette et Cie. Nothing	ORGANIZATION	in the range of popular fiction is more fixed than the functioning of secret service opera - tives .

		We may always count upon them for fecun - dity in clues , fastening guilt on the wrong person , and then a lightning flash on the threshold of the final chapter , which is always devoted to tying the loose ends of the story into a lover 's knot .

		This method is completely exemplified in The Apartment Next Door -LRB- Little Brown ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , in which
William Johnson	PERSON	joins the Great American Ger - man-Spy Chase .

		The complications arise chiefly out of having so many kinds of secret agents in this country '' each lot trying to make a record for it - self and not taking the others into its confidence . ''

		Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	abets this secretiveness to his utmost .

FRANCIS NEILSON	PERSON	,
Member of Parliament	ORGANIZATION	1910-1915 DIPLOMATS are now making peace .

		How many persons are familiar with the complexities and involutions of the questions with which they are dealing ?

		ONLY by reading the incredible story of the moves on the chessboard of statecraft that led to the catastrophe can you interpret what the newspapers print and don ' t print about the
Paris	LOCATION	conference .


BERNARD SHAW	PERSON	'S disclosures , now exciting so much at - tention , contain little that has not been said in Mr.
Neilson	PERSON	's noteworthy contribution to history .

		HOW DIPLOMATS MAKE WAR By
FRANCIS NEILSON	PERSON	3d printing What ' f says the
London	LOCATION	Times about diplomacy as the root of war ? ''

		Who , then , makes war ?

		The answer is to be found in the Chancelleries of
Europe	LOCATION	, among the men who have too long played with human lives as pawns in a game of chess , who have become so enmeshed in formulas and the jargon of diplomacy that they have ceased to be conscious of the poignant realities with which they trifle .

		And thus will war continue to be made , until the great masses who are the sport of professional schemers and dreamers say the word which will bring , not eternal peace , for that is impossible , but a determination that wars shall be fought only in a just and righteous and vital cause . ''

		As to Mr.
Neilson	PERSON	's masterly grasp of the subject and his fascinating presentation , read these views : REVIEW OF REVIEWS : '' It Is a terrific indictment of the diplomatic game aa played by all the great European governments .

		It shows how dangerous is the survival of a diplomacy that is not only removed from contact with public opinion , but is even beyond the knowledge and reach of the people 's representatives in
Parliament	LOCATION	. ''

		THE PUBLIC : '' It is a stirring story of the rotten result of a sinister , lying , bluffing diplomacy that despoiled the Continent .

		And the final chapter , that makes a tre - mendous appeal for frankness and true democracy , is a notable one . ''

		THE NATION : '' He writes with a bitter pen .

		but has a large his - torical sweep and much knowledge ... As to one of the chief positions of the volume , no American will have any quarrel with the writer of this book .

		It is that no treaties , forms of international alliance , or agreements with other nations ought to be entered into until they have been submitted to the repre - sentatives of the people in
Parliament	LOCATION	. ''

		NEW YORK TIMES : '' The volume is written with much facility of ex - pression and a large fund of materials .

		In diplomatic matters it attacks the faults of the ruling class of
Great Britain	LOCATION	in much the same way as ' I accuse ! '

		attacked those of the corresponding class in Ger - many . ''

NEW YORK	LOCATION	When writing to advertisers plea & e mention THE DIAL .

		A FORTNIGHTLY The Moral Devastation of War T AH HE SOLDIER HAS BECOME a child .

		The camp is the place where this new child lives , and military discipline is the force which created him .

		This is the most striking thing about camp life .

		The soldiers have become children .

		They show the same playfulness , indifference , carelessness of conse - quence , and craving for change ; the same desire for excitement , for being on the go , for playing games of chance , that are characteristic of children .

		Like children they take no thought of the consequence of their acts or interest in the serious and important things of life .

		Amongst them are no politicians , and having a good time is their ambition in full .

		Like children , too , they make friends very easily , are extremely social and confidential , having practically no secrets from each other , and readily exchange the most intimate experiences with the friends of a day .

		This close friendship is not only in things of the spirit .

		The soldier 's sociability takes the form of great readiness to share the material things he has .

		On getting a box of '' goodies '' from home , one divides them with his `` buddies '' -LRB- friends -RRB- and his friends include all the soldiers in sight and with the sharing of the '' goodies '' one natur - ally shares his news , and his letters are often read aloud especially if they happen to be from some admiring and naive ladylove who opens her lone - some heart in terms of endearment to her soldier boy .

		They love to shout , to sing , to gamble , to fight , to get into escapades , to indulge in pleasantries , and take the world , so to speak , as a playhouse and life as a game where the rules are still to be made and where responsibility and laws have no existence .

		This attitude is very strong .

		It prevails with practically all soldiers .

		It forces itself upon all of the men who remain in the army as privates .

		I am not speaking of the officer .

		I know very little about him , and there are influences which must have a counteracting and restraining effect .

		But for the private soldier this tendency to forget the world one came from , to lose interest in the serious and weighty things that filled one 's life before , and succumb to the irresponsibility in thought and act that is bred in army life , is almost universal .

		Only he who fails to become a soldier fails to participate in this spirit of irresponsibility and he is a very poor soldier indeed , if that prove the case , even if he continue in the military service and wear his uni - form .

		I have seen serious men , troubled and wor - ried with heavy responsibilities and interests either personal or social , succumb to this influence , and in a little while lose themselves and become indifferent to the whole world excepting the very immediate problem of escaping from boredom .

		For boredom is the curse of the camp .

		Monotony , constant repetition of the same fact , unending similarity and likeness in experience and labor and environment become the chief factors in the soldier 's life as soon as the novelty of the situa - tion wears off .

		This makes the one great aim , the one great ambition of the soldier in camp , to escape the weight of an uncontrollable self-subordination that destroys all difference and all individuality .

		There is an equality about camp life that is ideal .

		It knows no variation .

		It is perfect .

		It reduces all things to one level .

		It dresses all bodies in one cloth , and contracts all souls into one mood irresponsi - bility .

		For the soldier 's life is so arranged that the only thing to do is to be irresponsible .

		His food , shelter , and clothing are provided for him .

		He has no voice in matters of the most intimate and , per - sonal activity .

		He can do nothing of his own voli - tion .

		The buttons on his coat are regulated by a rule which he did not make and which he can not change .

		The shape of his shoes , the color of his hat cord , the size of his necktie , and the place of his bed are regulated and determined for him .

		He lives a life where the will has no meaning , and where thought and initiative are not only not demanded but suppressed .

		He is a nearer approach to an ani - mate , tool acting under response to external stimuli than any other human contrivance .

		, - ' This reduction of the individual variant is not only in things material but in things spiritual as well .

		Not only do soldiers look alike , but to an extraordinary degree they think and feel alike and about the same things .

		In civil life each individual is constantly called upon to exercise initiative in the solution of problems peculiar to himself which involve personal responsibility .

		But in the army the THE DIAL
April 5	DATE	problem and the situation are very much alike for each man .

		It is the problem of finding some medium of creative individual expression inside a system that strives to mold all character and all thought into a single formula and into a single type a type capable of acting without hesitation to certain given and purely external stimuli having little or no correlation within the experiences of the men themselves .

		But man can not live on obedience and submis - sion alone .

		The soldier demands something else .

		He craves some form of activity involving personal responsibility and individual effort .

		And to satisfy this need for self-expression that finds some outlet in civil life compatible with the ordinary interests of the individual , no matter how cramped and nar - row those interests may be , is in the army possible only in extra-military things things having no re - lation with the activities which the army imposes upon the men .

		They can not contribute to the serious things that are expected of them , and so they seek and find satisfaction in extra-military things generally frowned upon in civil life which , in the army , become a natural and normal variant to the regular and non-varying form of existence imposed from above .

		It would seem , of course , that this situation would provide an excel - lent opportunity for good and wholesome external influence along moral and educational lines .

		For the soldier needs some outlet , and his external life makes him very easily subject to influence .

		Un - fortunately , however , no such provision at all ade - quate has been provided .

		I do not at present want to go into a discussion of the activities ot the various welfare organizations and of their value to the soldier , excepting to say that their activities have , as a whole , failed to reach the core of the problem the provision of an opportunity for initiative and self-expression and that at the very best they have reached but a small portion of the men .

		While they have had a very definite value in providing little things , they have failed in the larger and deeper sense failed both as educational and as moral centers providing an imaginative and convincing in - terpretation of the world forces which brought the men into the army .

		In fact , the truth is that not only did they fail to give to the soldier something of the meaning of the things involved in a spiritual way in
America	LOCATION	's entrance into the war , or of the full significance of the slogans that were abroad as indications of those values , but that they seem never to have realized that there was an opportunity to fulfill a very definite need .

		The welfare organiza - tions as a whole seem to have been perfectly helpless in the light of this need .

		Their lack of imagination and their helpless and antiquated attitude as to what constitutes the essentials of moral activity under these conditions is pathetic .

		They therefore failed to render the one vital and essential service to both the soldier and the nation that was at this time so much needed , and that would have given these or - ganizations a real part in making the American war effort mean something to the world in a spiritual way .

		This failure to make provision for the intel - lectual and spiritual needs of the men left them to their own resources to find an escape from their monotonous world and find it in some measure they did .

		The paths to self-expression in camp are ex - tremely limited .

		And some form of self-expression is essential if men are to retain any semblance of self in an environment so consistently organized to destroy individual personality .

		Some soldiers came to the army as lovers of books , and in that way found a means of keeping alive their spiritual world .

		Others had the good fortune to play some musical instrument and gave vent to their pent-up feelings by playing .

		But most men are neither lovers of books , nor musicians , and even those who are , as a rule , find their environment unconducive to a main - tenance of that interest .

		For men in camp are ex - tremely restless , unable to concentrate , anxious for novelty and change , and not satisfied with the forms of expression that proved satisfactory under normal conditions .

		There is , therefore , for the soldier only a limited field capable of providing sufficient excite - ment and interest and opportunity for self-forget - fulness , and that field is chiefly represented by two things gambling and women .

		It is no exaggeration to say that practically every soldier gambles .

		There is no other activity that is so popular or that seems so satisfactory .

		Gambling has many forms , but the shooting of dice -LRB- '' craps '' -RRB- is the most popular .

		Of all games it is the greatest game of chance and luck , and is therefore the most universal . ''

		Crap shooting '' for money is pro- hibited in the army , and in my camp there has just been issued an order increasing the penalty .

		But that is the one rule that no one obeys .

		It is played everywhere and on all occasions .

		I have seen men on the drill field given a few minutes rest take the dice from their pockets and start a game .

		At night when the lights are out they will crouch around a candle shielded from observation , and stretched on the floor , or straight on their stomachs , with bated breath and flushed faces , either as participants or observers , spend hours in the game .

		After payday it is usual to stay up all night , and many a man is broke before morning dawns again , to spend the rest of the month in borrowing '' smokes . ''

		While '' crap '' playing is the most general of all games of chance , it is not the only one .

		Cards in varying IQI9 THE DIAL 335 forms , with poker holding its own as the chief , is certainly next in line of favor .

		After payday many will stay up nights and play for high stakes , until practically all of the money is held by a very few of the card experts in the company .

		To this must be added the capacity to turn every situation into a game of chance .

		Men will gamble as to who will buy a drink when in the canteen , or as to whether there will be chicken for dinner .

		Every dogmatic statement is met by a challenge from the spelling of a word to the day of mustering out , or as to whether it will rain or snow in the
morning	TIME	.

		Prob - ably the most interesting game of chance I witnessed took place one night when I was teaching spelling .

		I had a class in elementary English and some boys were in the test as observers , others as students .

		The spelling lesson developed into a spelling match , the men betting against each other as to whether they could or could not spell the next word .

		I agreed to give the words in order as they appeared in the spelling book , and words with the same number of syllables .

		In a little while the observers began to bet , each choosing his particular favorite to bet on .

		The tent soon filled to overflowing and the game was in full swing .

		Up to eleven , when taps was sounded , we had an exciting time of it .

		I have never witnessed so much will and enthusiasm in the learning of spelling as for the pupils , they learned more spelling that night than in any other .

		It was a very successful evening , also , for the schoolmaster , in spite of the fact that the rest of the schedule was crowded by this sudden love for spelling .

		It made the school .

		It gave it social standing and the teacher an unwonted popularity .

		The soldier is very much concerned about woman .

		Just as gambling is one of the serious occupations of the soldier , so is the search after woman one of the great games he plays .

		It is the game of a hunts - man , and like a good hunter he displays persistence , energy , avidity , and resourcefulness in the chase .

		And generally speaking , this activity in the pursuit of woman is not in vain , for by and large practi - cally every soldier who participates in this activ - ity and a very large majority do finds his efforts rewarded .

		And in this process he reduces all social institutions within his reach , from the church to the gambling house , to an instrument for his end , and does so deliberately .

		The talk in some quarters to the effect that mili - tary discipline has made a moral saint of the Amer - ican soldier emanates from sources that would place a wish above a fact .

		And the fact is that the soldier is very much more unmoral than when he entered the army a fact that has few , if any , exceptions .

		The truth that infectious diseases are less common in the army than they were , or than they are known to be in some large cities , is due not so much to greater voluntary abstinence , to higher morality , or even to the lack of opportunity for its spreading , but rather to the fact that military efficiency is not consistent with pnjdery , and that the army has faced the problem and made provision for its discovery and treatment on a scale more adequate for the situa - tion than in civil life but most of all to the fact that educational preventive measures are a part of the army scheme and method in dealing with this problem .

		In fact the army has done a remarkable piece of educational work in sex hygiene .

		An inter - esting illustration of the method of approach is the fact that a man is court-martialed for not reporting exposure to contagion rather than for exposure as such .

		But the interesting thing in the present con - nection is the soldier 's attitude towards woman as that attitude is affected by his life in camp and the narrow outlets which it forces upon him .

		This atti - tude is unexpected .

		It is the attitude of the scientist .

		It is an attitude shorn of modesty , morals , sentiment , and subjectivity .

		It is immodest , unmoral , objec - tive , evaluating , and experimental .

		Men will sit till late at night in a darkened tent , or lie on their cots , their faces covered with the pale glow of a tent stove that .

		burns red on cold nights , and talk about women but this talk is of the physical rather than the emotional , of the types , the reactions , the temperaments , the differences and the peculiarities of moral concepts , the degrees of perversity , the physical reactions , the methods of approach in fact , as if it were a problem in physics rather than morals .

		The lack of personal interest , the freedom from care , the absence of the restraint of family and asso - ciation , the close intimacy with men to the exclusion of women , accentuates the interest of and the crav - ing for woman .

		This craving for the escape from an unnatural and dissatisfying condition lacks how - ever most of those sentimental and affectional as - pects which we consider a normal consequence to the intimacy between man and woman .

		It is an expres - sion of physical hunger desiring physical satiation .

		It is very much akin to the craving for food by a hungry man , and is talked about and discussed in terms applicable to food hunger , food acquisition , and food satisfying qualities .

		This predominating unemotional attitude is so characteristic that it pervades the atmosphere .

		Let me illustrate .

		In the town near my camp the public woman has been driven from the street .

		Some hun - dred of them are now in jail .

		But prostitution has prevailed .

		The soliciting previously carried on openly by the women is now in the hands of young boys boys from twelve to sixteen years of age .

		After being accosted a number of times one evening by some of these youngsters I made some remark 33 6 THE DIAL
April 5	DATE	offensive to one young huckster , and in reply he avowed , '' Look a ' here , Soldier , I tell you it is clean , fresh , and good . ''

		These were the very adjectives , and others like them , which are on the lips of the men in camp when discussing the problem of sex an attitude applicable not only to the public woman , but to all women in general .

		That there are some ex - ceptions to this rule is probably true , but it is also true that these exceptions are rare .

		The deteriorating influences of camp life involve other aspects than those indicated , but the widely heralded virtues bred by military discipline and be - yond a certain readiness of give and take and greater sociability I do not know what they are are achieved at a very heavy cost in terms of human personality .

		Aside from the political aspects of military institutions , when viewed purely as an in - fluence upon human personality , army life proves to be unhappy in its consequence .

		For not only does gambling become the chief of the moral occupations , and the physical attitude towards sex a reversion to a type that is not generally considered desirable , but in addition to those things it definitely deterior - ates the sense of individuality , of self-respect , of interest , and of that something that gives to a nor - mal being his fiber and his grip upon the world about him .

		It is a very great destroyer of values values cherished in civil life .

		Probably the meaning is best illustrated by a remark made by a Sergeant - Major who , upon being discharged , and while saying good-by , turned to me and said : '' I am very glad to go home . ''

		`` And why this great gladness ? ''

		I asked . ''

		Well , it darn near makes a criminal of you if you stay in it long enough , '' was the reply .

		And this remark tells a tale that includes most of the things I am trying to say .

		It seems a matter of great doubt whether this deteriorating influence could be modified or elimi - nated by giving something to the army life that it has not at present something that is described as education .

		The evidence seems to point to the fact that as long as young men are herded together on a large scale and deprived of the opportunities to con - tribute democratically to the determination of their own destinies , their own government , and their own labors , no amount of external palliatives will destroy the more serious evils involved in army life .

		And to democratize an army truly democratize it is to undermine the present function of all the military ideology and technique as it relates to the soldier , making him an obedient unthinking instru - ment of another 's will .

		There seems , in fact , no alternative .

		One must either accept the present scheme of army life with whatever palliatives and reforms are offered , and accept with it the general evils that come from such a life , or set one 's face like flint against the whole scheme of military pur - pose and military ends .

		The soldier 's efforts at escape from a dull en - vironment and his efforts to find an outlet for his personal activities are rarely successful .

		Neither gambling nor women make such provision , and the desire to escape the immediate is always the strongest and most obvious thought and purpose that he exhibits .

		He is never happier than when he is on the go .

		Long before the war ended there was some rumor to the effect that my Division would be held on this side for a winter 's training .

		Not only were we chagrined at being denied the privilege of going across , but we were made extremely unhappy at the thought of having to spend a winter in camp , and one soldier put it tersely and with the com - mon approval of all , '' I would rather spend the next six months in Hell than here . ''

Blackstone	ORGANIZATION	, in
1765	DATE	.

		1 HE RECONSTRUCTION POLICY of the
Administra	ORGANIZATION	- tion was announced on
Monday	DATE	,
December 2 , 1918	DATE	.

		In an address to the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	and the
House	ORGANIZATION	of Rep - resentatives of the
United States	LOCATION	in congress assem - bled the President said : Our people ... do not want to be coached and led .

		They know their own business , are quick and re - sourceful at every readjustment , definite in purpose , and self-reliant in action .

		Any leading strings we might put them in would speedily become hopelessly tangled , be - cause they would pay no attention to them and go their own way ... From no quarter have I seen any gen - eral scheme of '' reconstruction '' which I thought it likely we could force our spirited business men and self-con - scious laborers to accept with due pliancy and obedience .

		This statement , blending current fact with obso - lete reason , seems out of place in an after-the-war world .

		The immediate response of the country to it was inharmonious disapproval .

		The Republican politicians , whose intellectual bankruptcy is well known , and who are content to take any side of a public question the President may leave to them , pointed to another neglected opportunity .

		The busi - ness men , who inconsistently mix a demand for a protective tariff with dreams of a huge foreign trade , were sincerely disappointed .

		The provincials who make dislike or distrust of the chief executive the major premise of their political reasoning , cried out immediate disapproval , though they lacked the necessary '' therefores . ''

		The governmental officials at
Washington	LOCATION	were distressed to think of a transi - tion to peace proceeding without their bureaucratic supervision .

		The champions of panaceas , who are always with us , had found the vast and empty con - cept of '' reconstruction '' much to their liking , and were put out to see it taken from them so uncere - moniously .

		And even the liberals , who all along have been the President 's stanchest friends , were seriously disturbed .

		To them the voice was the voice of the President , but the speech was that of a younger Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	.

		It suggested the young law student enthusiastic over his
Blackstone	ORGANIZATION	, the in - structor in the denominational college expounding
Adam Smith	PERSON	's theory of '' the invisible hand , '' the presidential candidate preaching '' the new free - dom '' from the gospel according to
Jefferson	LOCATION	.

		What led Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	to his new laissez-faire it ' is impossible to say .

		One who has thumbed on a
Washington	LOCATION	desk and tried to read the mind of the man in the
White House	ORGANIZATION	just across
Lafayette Park	LOCATION	will claim no ability to fathom the mystery of presidential contemplation .

		But , whatever the mo - tive , as the matter stood in
December	DATE	, there were reasons for the President 's choice .

		However seri - ous the consequences may be , the alternative policy freshly entered upon at that time would likewise have produced serious consequences .

		A brief state - ment of the situation will make this clear beyond peradventure .

		In the first place the
Administration	ORGANIZATION	was caught by the unexpected end of the war with - out a program for a return to peace .

		At that time the President had not succeeded in giving a content to the word '' reconstruction . ''

		There is little evi - dence that he had tried hard ; but the mind which coined the word supplied a cosmic term which he could reject as meaningless .

		In truth few expres - sions have ever given such genuine satisfaction to such an assortment of minds .

		To the exporters it meant foreign markets ; to the politicians , more offices ; to the guild socialists , at least industrial councils ; to the single taxers , the single tax ; and to social workers , '' betterment . ''

		The Weeks bill , robbed by the armistice of its chance to provoke sen - atorial oratory , meant by '' reconstruction '' what any banker would mean by it .

		The
Overman	PERSON	bill made it a conglomeration of all the things that needed tinkering with which the unimaginative mind of its sponsor could call up at the time .

		The
British Ministry of Reconstruction	ORGANIZATION	, in the likeness of which many would have created an American commission , resolved the matter into more than one hundred inquiries , ranging from the constitutionali - zation of industry to the demobilization of mules .

		As a minimum it seemed to mean the return to ordi - nary uses of the men and material displaced by the war .

		As a maximum it connoted an attempt to take advantage of the general state of flux to ar - range elements into a more pleasing social 1 order .

		Even in this variety Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	failed to discover a problem of reconstruction to his liking .

		It may have been design rather than accident which found him unprepared in
November	DATE	.

		Cer - tainly he had empowered no group of men to make a study and determine the feasibility of a program of reconstruction .

		On the contrary he seems to have settled the matter by assumption , or guess , or the chance advice of a trusted official .

		The half - 338 THE DIAL
April 5	DATE	hearted assent to the request of the
Council of Na	ORGANIZATION	- tional
Defense	ORGANIZATION
last June	DATE	to be permitted to look into the matter can be interpreted as little more than saying , '' If you think anything can be found in that vague inquiry , go to it .

		Far be it from me to deny you the pleasure . ''

		From the first he seems to have bothered little with the matter .

		And it must be admitted that from the first there was good reason , if not the best reason , for his reticence .

		He could not have thrilled over the accomplishments of the
British Ministry of Reconstruction	ORGANIZATION	, which was held up as a model for us .

		If he attempted to find reason in the maze of their reports he dis - covered that only two significant recommendations appeared as the result of their countless labors .

		And , peculiarly enough , both of these the scheme for industrial councils and the plan for demobilization in terms of industrial needs were well under way when the committees having them in charge were associated with the
Reconstruction Ministry	ORGANIZATION	.

		As for the hundred and more other sub-committees , each did in isolation its appointed task , each per - formed its clerical labors undisturbed by what others were doing .

		.

		Most of them decided , as dic -LRB- the sub-committee upon the chemical industry , that the situation after the war would most likely be a serious one and that something ought to be done about it .

		Quite likely Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	did not busy himself to find out how much better an American commission could do .

		If he had , , it is by no means certain that he would have been greatly impressed .

		He must know , perhaps better than anyone else , the unsuit - ableness of agencies of state for such a task .

		First of all , there is neither in
Washington	LOCATION	nor else - where an adequate body of knowledge about the organization - of industry , its interrelations with finance and commerce , and its place in the social life of the nation .

		The figures which have been gathered into imposing statistical tables relate to the most immediate and ephemeral of problems .

		The scheme upon which they have been gathered and interpreted is irrelevant to the larger problems involved in controlling a developing industrial soci - ety .

		Second , there is small reason for thinking that any commission which would have proved accept - able to the country would have been willing to ap - proach its problems without bias .

		At present the decisions of state rest upon rule of thumb , prejudice , and the chance bias of the glad-hand administrator in fact upon anything except an application of the methods of scientific procedure to the matter in hand .

		Its prejudice against intellect would have prevented any commission from obtaining the in - formation without which any action is worse than no action .

		And third , even if an adequate program of reconstruction could have been devised , the spirit of cooperation necessary to its execution could never have been attained .

		The many-sided thing known outside of
Washington	LOCATION	as '' the government '' would have prevented that .

		But , whether by acci - dent or no , Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	was caught in
November	DATE	without a reconstruction program , and plead per - suasively , if not convincingly , for a return to laissez-faire .

		In the second place , a positive program of re - construction was bad politics .

		However we may insist that the common good must override the ex - igencies of party strife , Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	has always kept one eye upon the future of his party .

		Even with the war on , a cry of '' paternalism '' had been raised against the government ; no one knew better than the President that a '' reconstructed peace '' would be damned by his political opponents as '' socialism . ''

		At the time of the armistice the government had just passed the inevitable period of blundering .

		Its program of control was just beginning to vindicate itself in positive results .

		Evidence of this prelimi - nary inefficiency was at hand to damn any adminis - tration which persisted in the policy .

		In fact Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's opponents were counting upon a continu - ance of control , had massed their fire upon this issue , and were determined to make the most of it .

		They were persuaded that the country was pre - pared to believe with them that what was medicine in time of war became poison upon the return to peace .

		The President 's tactics robbed them of a convincing argument .

		It is true that he took the chance of being damned for the ills which attend the lack of a preparation for peace .

		But he escaped condemnation for the evils which would have at - tended a badly executed program for the transition period .

		As between relying upon the knowledge and wisdom of the gods of chance with whom he has a passing acquaintance , and the foresight and discretion of an administration he knows thoroughly , Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	preferred the gods .

		His program of a lasting peace for the world moved him to the same decision .

		The President 's is '' a single-track mind '' and he understands that the nation is made up of like-minded individuals .

		The secret of his political art has always been in en - gaging the minds of the people upon one question at a time .

		He is right in rating the issue of an in - surance against war higher than any domestic mat - ter .

		It was easy for him to conclude that whatever of good or ill the term '' reconstruction '' veiled , it could wait .

		Its intrusion at this time would dis - turb the mind of a nation at a time when he wanted it fixed upon the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	.

		In addition the peace program must not be allowed to incur ill will stirred up by a reconstruction program .

		IQI9 THE DIAL 339 In the third place a positive program of recon - struction would have proved most unpopular .

		The President is right in saying that the nation at large was crying aloud for a return to laissez-faire .

		While the fight was on , our people were willing to make the sacrifices which they regarded as neces - s #ry to victory ; but beneath the battle there was re - sentment at state interference , which accumulated into a vast volume of unexpressed protest .

		Manu - facturers were less sure of the logic of priorities than they were of that of a maximum wage ; em - ployers objected to an excess profits tax but would welcome a conscription of labor ; laborers objected strenuously to '' profiteering , '' but made no applica - tion of the word to their own work and wages .

		Peculiarly enough there was little impatience at loans , contributions to war charities , and taxes .

		The serious burdens imposed by the questionable methods by which the war was financed , which found expression in inflation and high prices , pro- voked little protest .

		On the contrary the petty an - noyances connected with state supervision were a constant source of irritation .

		In general the pub - lic disapproval of governmental departments varied directly with their efficiency .

		It would be hard , for instance , to convince anyone who knew the
Food Administration	ORGANIZATION	intimately that its activities consist - ed in anything more than vain motions .

		Yet , by flattering the people into believing that their petty savings made holy martyrs of them , it became the most popular of all the government departments .

		The signing of the armistice removed the incentive to silence .

		In
November	DATE	the country demanded in no unmistakable terms a return to laissez-faire .

		And the President decided , perhaps with a shrug of the shoulders , to let the people have their way .

		Nearly four eventful months have gone by since the President 's announcement of his reconversion to laissez-faire .

		Even now the time is not at hand for a final appraisal of his policy ; but the outlines of a tentative judgment seem unmistakable .

		Whether it is because of his proverbial luck , or his foresight , his policy looks better in
March	DATE	than it did in De - cember .

		This is not because the consequences of laissez-faire have been less serious than were antici - pated .

		On the contrary '' the industrial depression of
1919	DATE	, '' as it will be called in history , is coming more quickly than the foreminded thought .

		The great advantage of the policy has been in allowing the public to discover reconstruction for itself .

		A nation which requires visible evidence of a problem 's actual presence before it will think about it has been goaded into attention .

		But the time for antitoxins is now past and only medicine or surgery will suffice .

		To judge the policy aright we must separate the '' reconstruction '' from the '' demobilization '' prob - lem ; we must draw some sort of a line between the < -LRB- emergency '' and the '' constructive '' problem .

		The more we have in mind the immediate ques - tions of readjustment , the less merit we can see in laissez-faire .

		But the more we consider the ulti - mate issues of the coming `` peace the more of good it seems to hold .

		In terms of the latter it says that the government is not the proper agency , and this is not the proper time , to settle the larger issues of machine industry and human welfare .

		It insists that these are abiding questions which society must attend to in the process of its gradual development .

		The policy prevents much ado and little done un - der the pretense of reconstructing the country .

		It enables specific problems to be dealt with by proper agencies as they arise .

		It breaks up the larger prob - lems into bits which are manageable and permits time for an adequate understanding and an adequate solution .

		Upon the `` constructive '' problem the President 's recommendations seem sound .

		But it seems impossible to overlook the neglect of the '' emergency '' problem .

		It can be justified only upon one of two distinct theories .

		The first is that the President expected demobilization to be successfully effected in terms of the ordained ritual of the
War Department	ORGANIZATION	.

		The second is that his belief in laissez-faire rose to the transcendental heights of faith in its efficacy for even so great an emergency .

		To make the first the fact is to ac - cuse him of ignorance of the limitations of military procedure .

		To make the second his motive is to charge him with failing to comprehend what is in - volved in demobilization .

		The latter seems to have been the case .

		For two reasons the President 's reliance upon '' the simple and obvious system of natural liberty , '' exhibited in '' spirited business men '' and '' self - conscious laborers , '' was misplaced .

		In the first place ordinary business practice can not be depended upon to secure the full employment of all produc - tive resources .

		The end of the war brought a threat to employer 's profits , the motive upon which Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	depends for reorganization .

		The cancella - tion of government contracts aggregating at least ten
` billion dollars	MONEY	robbed many employ9rs of profitable markets .

		The threatened loss to these industries held a threat to others supplying them with materials and a threat of loss of employment to men .

		It discouraged buying , which in turn again threatened profits .

		In addition an anticipated fall in prices discouraged business activity , just when expansion was required to provide work for the men in the army .

		In the absence of a plan designed to accele - 340 THE DIAL
April 5	DATE	rate business enterprise , an industrial depression of greater or less magnitude threatened , attended by idleness of plants , unemployment of labor , and waste of human and material resources .

		In the second place ordinary business activity could not be depended upon to secure within the de - mobilization period a proper distribution of men and materials among different industries .

		If each producer acted for himself and in ignorance of the action of others , the immediate result would be the overproduction of certain goods and the underpro - duction of others .

		The losses attending overproduc - tion would impose a check upon business enterprise and lead to a still further disorganization of the system .

		Eventually , of course , as any champion of laissez-faire can show , matters would all work out nicely .

		Sooner or later business would expand and all the elements of capital and labor would be drawn into active work , at least all that survived .

		But this readjustment by a process of trial and error is wasteful and slow .

		Even before the war many eco - nomists were questioning the ability of business en - terprise effectively to organize production and that without a loss of their orthodoxy .

		Then the aggre - gate of change from one line of production to an - other could not have been more than two or three per cent of the total volume of industry per year .

		If the efficacy of the magic was questionable then , what can be expected of it if from twenty-five to
thirty-five per cent	MONEY	of the whole is to be diverted from emergency to ordinary uses within a short period of time ?

		At best it is a poor alternative to a carefully formulated plan which approaches demo - bilization as a problem in industrial ` organization and attempts to formulate principles for the speedy and discriminating return of men and materials to ac - tive industry .

		Whatever justification may be given a neglect of the problems of reconstruction , the failure of the
Administration	ORGANIZATION	to formulate a demobilization policy is inexcusable .

		If the President regarded it as a matter of mere manipulations , he should have in - quired into its nature rather than judge it by intuition .

		If he considered the War Department adequate to handle it , he should have informed him - self more particularly about the tasks which it can and can not do .

		If adequate knowledge for even this smaller task was lacking , he made no attempt to supply the deficiency .

		If he had no confidence in the personnel of the departments and boards which would have been charged with the execution of a demobilization program , they held their places sub - ject to his discretion .

		If the mind of the nation was to be kept upon the need of a lasting peace , it was necessary to prevent the distractions which were the inevitable consequences of even a temporary lapse to laissez-faire .

		The psychology of one thing at a time is unquestioned .

		But the fact is that the end of the war brought two immediate and imperative problems .

		Peace had to be made and the industrial system had to be restored to a peace basis .

		The double-track problem required a double-track mind .

		If it was necessary to see to it that the coming peace be a permanent one , it was no less necessary to take care that abiding values be read into the industrial system which is being reestablished .

		EMANUEL CARNEVALI .

		1919 THE DIAL On the Nature and Uses of Sabotage ABOTAGE '' IS A DERIVATIVE of ''
Sabot	PERSON	, '' which is French for a wooden shoe .

		It means going slow , with a dragging , clumsy movement , such as that manner of footgear may be expected to bring on .

		So it has come to describe any maneuver of slowing - down , inefficiency , bungling , obstruction .

		In Ameri - can usage the word is very often taken to mean forcible obstruction , destructive tactics , industrial frightfulness , incendiarism and high explosives , al - though that is plainly not its first meaning nor its common meaning .

		Nor is that its ordinary mean - ing as the word is used among those who have advocated a recourse to sabotage as a means of enforcing an argument about wages or the condi - tion of work .

		The ordinary meaning of the word is better defined by an expression which has latterly come into use among the
I. W. W.	PERSON	, '' conscientious withdrawal of efficiency '' although that phrase does not cover all that is rightly to be included under this technical term .

		The sinister meaning which is often attached to the word in American usage , as denoting violence and disorder , appears to be due to the fact that the American usage has been shaped chiefly by persons and newspapers who have aimed to discredit the use of sabotage by organized workmen , and who have therefore laid stress on its less amiable mani - festations .

		This is unfortunate .

		It lessens the usefulness of the word by making it a means of denunciation rather than of understanding .

		No doubt violent obstruction has had its share in the strategy of sabotage as carried on by disaffected workmen , as well as in the similar tactics of rival business concerns .

		It comes into the case as one method of sabotage , though by no means the most usual or the most effective ; but it is so spectacular and shocking a method that it has drawn undue at - tention to itself .

		Yet such deliberate violence is , no doubt , a relatively minor fact in the case , as com - pared with that deliberate malingering , confusion , and misdirection of work that makes up the bulk of what the expert practitioners would recognize as legitimate sabotage .

		The word first came into use among the organized French workmen , the members of certain syndicats , to describe their tactics of passive resistance , and it has continued to be associated with the strategy of these French workmen , who are known as syndi - calists , and with their like-minded running-mates in other countries .

		But the tactics of these syndi - calists , and their use of sabotage , do not differ , ex - cept in detail , from the tactics of other workmen elsewhere , or from the similar tactics of friction , obstruction , and delay habitually employed , from time to time , by both employees and employers to enforce an argument about wages and prices .

		There - fore , in the course of a quarter-century past , the word has quite unavoidably taken on a general meaning in common speech , and has been extended to cover all such peaceable or surreptitious maneu - vers of delay , obstruction , friction , and defeat , whether employed by the workmen to enforce their claims , or by the employers to defeat their em - ployees , or by competitive business concerns to get the better of their business rivals or to secure their own advantage .

		Such maneuvers of restriction , delay , and hin - drance have a large share in the ordinary conduct of business ; but it is only lately that this ordinary line of business strategy has come to be recognized as being substantially of the same nature as the ordinary tactics of the syndicalists .

		So that it has not been usual until the
last few years	DATE	to speak of maneuvers of this kind as sabotage when they are employed by employers and other business concerns .

		But all this strategy of delay , restriction , hindrance , and defeat is manifestly of the same character , and should conveniently be called by the same name , whether it is carried on by business men or by work - men ; so that it is no longer unusual now to find workmen speaking of `` capitalistic sabotage '' as free - ly as the employers and the newspapers speak of syndicalist sabotage .

		As the word is now used , and as it is properly used , it describes a certain system of industrial strategy or management , whether it is employed by one or another .

		What it describes is a resort to peaceable or surreptitious restriction , delay , withdrawal , or obstruction .

		Sabotage commonly works within the law , al - though it may often be within the letter rather than the spirit of the law .

		It is used to secure some special advantage or preference , usually of a busi - nesslike sort .

		It commonly has to do with some - thing in the nature of a vested right , which one or another of the parties in the case aims to secure or defend , or to defeat or diminish ; some preferential right or special advantage in respect of income or privilege , something in the way of a vested interest .

		Workmen have resorted to such measures to secure improved conditions of work , or increased wages , or shorter hours , or to maintain their habitual standards , to all of which they have claimed to have some sort of a vested right .

		Any strike is of the nature of sabotage , of course .

		Indeed , a 342 THE DIAL
April 5	DATE	strike is a typical species of sabotage .

		That strikes have not been spoken of as sabotage is due to the accidental fact that strikes were in use before this word came into use .

		So also , of course , a lockout is another typical species of sabotage .

		That the lockout is employed by the employers against the employees does not change the fact that it is a means of defending a vested right by delay , with - drawal , defeat , and obstruction of the work to be done .

		Lockouts have not usually been spoken of as sabotage , for the same reason that holds true in the case of strikes .

		All the while it has been recog - nized that strikes and lockouts are of identically the same character .

		All this does not imply that there is anything discreditable or immoral about this habitual use of strikes and lockouts .

		They are part of the ordinary conduct of industry under the existing system , and necessarily so .

		So long as the system remains un - changed these measures are a necessary and legiti - mate part of it .

		By virtue of his ownership the owner-employer has a vested right to do as he will with his own property , to deal or not to deal with any person that offers , to withhold or withdraw any part or all of his industrial equipment and natural resources from active use for the time being , to run on half time or to shut down his plant and to lock out all those persons for whom he has no present use on his own premises .

		There is no ques - tion that the lockout is altogether a legitimate maneuver .

		It may even be meritorious , and it is frequently considered to be meritorious when its use helps to maintain sound conditions in business that is to say , profitable conditions , as frequently happens .

		Such is the view of the substantial citi - zens .

		So also is the strike legitimate , so long as it keeps within the law ; and it may at times even be meritorious , at least in the eyes of the strikers .

		It is to be admitted quite broadly that both of these typical species of sabotage are altogether fair and honest in principle , although it does not therefore follow that every strike or every lockout is neces - sarily fair and honest in its working-out .

		That is in some degree a question of special circumstances .

		Sabotage , accordingly , is not to be condemned out of hand , simply as such .

		There are many meas - ures of policy and management both in private busi - ness and in public administration which are un - mistakably of the nature of sabotage and which are not only considered to be excusable , but are de - liberately sanctioned by statute and common law and by the public conscience .

		Many such measures are quite of the essence of the case under the estab - lished system of law and order , price and business , and are faithfully believed to be indispensable to the common good .

		It should not be difficult to show that the common welfare in any community which is organized on the price system can not be maintained without a salutary use of sabotage that is to say , such habitual recourse to delay and obstruc - tion of industry and such restriction of output as will maintain prices at a reasonably profitable level and so guard against business depression .

		Indeed , it is precisely considerations of this nature that are now engaging the best attention of officials and business men in their endeavors to tide over a threatening depression in American business and a consequent season of hardship for all those per - sons whose main dependence is free income from investments .

		Without some salutary restraint in the way of sabotage on the productive use of the available in - dustrial plant and workmen , it is altogether unlikely that prices could be maintained at a reasonably profitable figure for any appreciable time .

		A busi - nesslike control of the rate and volume of output is indispensable for keeping up a profitable market , and a profitable market is the first and unremitting condition of prosperity in any community whose in - dustry is owned and managed by business men .

		And the ways and means of this necessary control of the output of industry are always and necessarily some - thing in the nature of sabotage something in the way of retardation , restriction , withdrawal , unem - ployment of plant and workmen whereby produc - tion is kept short of productive capacity .

		The me - chanical industry of the new order is inordinately - productive .

		So the rate and volume of output have to be regulated with a view to what the traffic will bear that is to say , what will yield the largest net return in terms of price to the business men in charge of the country 's industrial system .

		Otherwise there will be `` overproduction , '' business depression , and consequent hard times all round .

		Overproduction means production in excess of what the market will carry off at a sufficiently profitable price .

		So it appears that the continued prosperity of the coun - try from day to day hangs on a `` conscientious withdrawal of efficiency '' by the business men who control the country 's industrial output .

		They con - trol it all for their own use , of course , and their own use means always a profitable price .

		In any community that is organized on the price system , with investment and business enterprise , habitual unemployment of the available indus - trial plant and workmen , in whole or in part , appears to be the .

		indispensable condition without which tolerable conditions of life can not be main - tained .

		That is to say , in no such community can the industrial system be allowed to work at full IQI9 THE DIAL 343 capacity for any appreciable interval of time , on pain of business stagnation and consequent privation for all classes and conditions of men .

		The require - ments of profitable business will not tolerate it .

		So the rate and volume of output must be adjusted to the needs of the market , not to the working capacity of the available resources , equipment and man power , nor to the community 's need of consumable goods .

		Therefore there must always be a certain variable margin of unemployment of plant and man power .

		Rate and volume of output can , of course , not be adjusted by exceeding the productive capacity of the industrial system .

		So it has to be regulated by keeping short of maximum production by more or less , as the condition of the market may require .

		It is always a question of more or less unemploy - ment of plant and man power , and a shrewd moder - ation in the unemployment of these available re - sources , a '' conscientious withdrawal of efficiency , '' therefore , is the beginning of wisdom in all sound workday business enterprise that has to do with industry .

		All this is matter of course and notorious .

		But it is not a topic on which one prefers to dwell .

		Writers and speakers who dilate on the meritorious exploits of the nation 's business men will not corn - manly allude to this voluminous running adminis - tration of sabotage , this conscientious withdrawal of efficiency , that goes into their ordinary day 's work .

		One prefers to dwell on those exceptional , sporadic , and spectacular episodes in business where business men have now and again successfully gone out of the safe and sane highway of conservative business enterprise that is hedged about with a conscientious withdrawal of efficiency , and have endeavored to regulate the output by increasing the productive capacity of the industrial system at one point or another .

		But after all , such habitual recourse to peaceable or surreptitious measures of restraint , delay , and obstruction in the ordinary businesslike management of industry is too widely known and too well ap - proved to call for much exposition or illustration .

		Yet , as one capital illustration of the scope and force of such businesslike withdrawal of efficiency , it may be in place to recall that all the civilized nations are just now undergoing an experiment in businesslike sabotage on an unexampled scale and carried out with unexampled effrontery .

		All these nations that have come through the war , whether as belligerents or as neutrals , have come into a state of more or less pronounced distress , due to a scarcity of the common necessaries of life ; and this distress falls , of course , chiefly on the common sort , who have at the same time borne the chief burden of the war which has brought them to this state of distress .

		The common man has won the war and lost his livelihood .

		This need not be said by way of praise or blame .

		As it stands it is , broadly , an objective statement of fact , which may need some slight qualification , such as broad statements of fact will commonly need .

		All these nations that have come through the war , and more particularly the common run of their populations , are very much in need of all sorts of supplies for daily use , both for immediate consumption and for productive use .

		So much so that the prevailing state of distress rises in many places to an altogether unwholesome pitch of privation , for want of the necessary food , clothing , and fuel .

		Yet in all these countries the staple in - dustries are slowing down .

		There is an ever in - creasing withdrawal of efficiency .

		The industrial plant is increasingly running idle or half idle , run - ning increasingly short of its productive capacity .

		Workmen are being laid off and an increasing num - ber of those workmen who have been serving in the armies are going idle for want of work , at the same time that the troops which are no longer needed in the service are being demobilized as slowly as popu - lar sentiment will tolerate , apparently for fear that the number of unemployed workmen in the country may ^ presently increase to such proportions as to bring on a catastrophe .

		And all the while all these peoples are in great need of all sorts of goods and services which these idle plants and idle workmen are fit to produce .

		But for reasons of business expediency it is impossible to let these idle plants and idle workmen go to work that is to say for reasons of insufficient profit to the business men interested , or in other words , for reasons of insufficient income to the vested interests which control the staple in - dustries and so regulate the output of product .

		The traffic will not bear so large a production of goods as the community needs for current consumption , because it is considered doubtful whether so large a supply could be sold at prices that would yield a '' reasonable profit on the investment or rather on the capitalization ; that is to say , it is considered doubtful whether an increased production , such as to employ more workmen and supply the goods needed by the community , would result in -LRB- an in - creased net aggregate income for the vested interests which control these industries .

		A reasonable profit always means , in effect , the largest obtainable profit .

		All this is simple and obvious , and it should scarcely need explicit statement .

		It is for these business men to manage the country 's industry , of course , and therefore to regulate the rate and volume of output ; and also of course any regulation of the output by them will be made with a view to the 344 THE DIAL
April	DATE	needs of business ; that is to say , with a view to the largest obtainable net profit , not with a view to the physical needs of these peoples who have come through the war and have made the world safe for the business of the vested interests .

		Should the business men in charge , by any chance aberration , stray from this straight and narrow path of business integrity , and allow the community 's needs unduly to influence their management of the community 's industry , they would presently find themselves dis - credited and would probably face insolvency .

		Their only salvation is a conscientious withdrawal of effi - ciency .

		All this lies in the nature of the case .

		It is the working of the price system , whose creatures and agents these business men are .

		Their case is rather pathetic , as indeed they admit quite volubly .

		They are not in a position to manage with a free hand , the reason being that they have in the past , under the routine requirements of the price system as it takes effect in corporation finance , taken on so large an overhead burden of fixed charges that any appreciable decrease in the net earnings of the busi - ness will bring any well-managed concern of this class face to face with bankruptcy .

		At the present conjuncture , brought on by the war and its termination , the case stands somewhat in this typical shape .

		In the recent past earnings have been large ; these large earnings -LRB- free income -RRB- have been capitalized ; their capitalized value has been added to the corporate capital and covered with securities bearing a fixed income-charge ; this income-charge , representing free income , has thereby become a liability on the earnings of the corporation ; this liability can not be met in case the concern 's net aggregate earnings fall off in any degree ; therefore prices must be kept up to such a figure as will bring the largest net aggregate return , and the only means of keeping up prices is a conscientious withdrawal of efficiency in these staple industries on which the community depends for a supply of the necessaries of life .

		The business community has hopes of tiding things over by this means , but it is still a point in doubt whether the present unexampled large use of sabo - tage in the businesslike management of the staple industries will now suffice to bring the business community through this grave crisis without a disas - trous shrinkage of its capitalization , and a consequent liquidation ; but the point is not in doubt that the physical salvation of these peoples who have come through the war must in any case wait on the pecuniary salvation of these owners of corporate securities which represent free income .

		It is a suffi - ciently difficult passage .

		It appears that production must be curtailed in the staple industries , on pain of unprofitable prices .

		The case is not so desperate in those industries which have immediately to do with the production of superfluities ; but even these , which depend chiefly on the custom of those kept classes to whom the free income goes , are not feel - ing altogether secure .

		For the good of business it is necessary to curtail production of the means of life , on pain of unprofitable prices , at the same time that the increasing need of all sorts of the neces - saries of life must be met in some passable fashion , on pain of such popular disturbances as will always come of popular distress when it passes the limit of tolerance .

		Those wise business men who are charged with administering the salutary modicum of sabotage at this grave juncture may conceivably be faced with a dubious choice between a distasteful curtailment of the free income that goes to the vested interests , on the one hand , and an unmanageable onset of popular discontent on the other hand .

		And in either alternative lies disaster .

		Present indications would seem to say that their choice will fall out according to ancient habit , that they will be likely to hold fast by an undiminished free income for the vested interests at the possible cost of any popular discon - tent that may be in prospect and then , with the help of the courts and the military arm , presently make reasonable terms with any popular discontent that may arise .

		In which event it should all occa - sion no surprise or resentment , inasmuch as it would be nothing unusual or irregular and would presum - ably be the most expeditious way of reaching a modus vivendi .

		During the past few weeks , too , quite an unusually large number of machine guns have been sold to industrial business concerns of the larger sort , here and there ; at least so they say .

		Business enterprise being the palladium of the Re - public , it is right to take any necessary measures for its safeguarding .

		Price is of the essence of the case , whereas livelihood is not .

		The grave emergency that has arisen out of the war and its provisional conclusion is , after all , nothing exceptional except in magnitude and sever - ity .

		In substance it is the same sort of thing that goes on continually but unobtrusively and as a matter of course in ordinary times of business as usual .

		It is only that the extremity of the case is calling attention to itself .

		At the same time it serves impressively to enforce the broad proposition that a conscientious withdrawal of efficiency is the beginning of wisdom in all established business en - terprise that has to do with industrial production .

		But it has been found that this grave interest which the vested interests always have in a salutary re - tardation of industry at one point or another can not IQI9 THE DIAL 345 well be left altogether to the haphazard and ill - coordinated efforts of individual business concerns , each taking care of its own particular line of sabotage within its own premises .

		The needed sabotage can best be administered on a compre - hensive plan and by a central authority , since the country 's industry is of the nature of a compre - hensive interlocking system , whereas the business concerns which are called on to control the motions of this industrial system will necessarily work piece - meal , in severalty and at cross-purposes .

		In effect , their working at cross-purposes results in a suffi - ciently large aggregate retardation of industry , of course , but the resulting retardation is necessarily somewhat blindly apportioned and does not con - verge to a neat and perspicuous outcome .

		Even a reasonable amount of collusion among the interested business concerns will not by itself suffice to carry on that comprehensive moving equilibrium of sabotage that is required to preserve the business community from recurrent collapse or stagnation , or to bring the nation 's traffic into line with the general needs of the vested interests .

		Where the national government is charged with the general care of the country 's business interests , as is invariably the case among the civilized nations , it follows from the nature of the case that the nation 's lawgivers and administration will have some share in administering that necessary modicum of sabotage that must always go into the day 's work of carrying on industry by business methods and for business purposes .

		The government is in a position to penalize excessive or unwholesome traffic .

		So , it is always considered necessary , or at least expedi - ent , by all sound mercantilists to impose and main - tain a certain balance or proportion among the several branches of industry and trade that go to make up the nation 's industrial system .

		The pur - pose commonly urged for measures of this class is the fuller utilization of the nation 's industrial re - sources in material , equipment , and man power ; the invariable effect is a lowered efficiency and a waste - ful use of these resources , together with an increase of international jealousy .

		But measures of that kind are thought to be expedient by the mercantilists for these purposes that is to say , by the statesmen of these civilized nations , for the purposes of the vested interests .

		The chief and nearly sole means of maintaining such a fabricated balance and proportion among the nation 's industries is to obstruct the traffic at some critical point by prohibiting or penal - izing any exuberant undesirables among these branches of industry .

		Disallowance , , in whole or in part , is the usual and standard method .

		The great standing illustration of sabotage ad - ministered by the government is the protective tariff , of course .

		It protects certain special interests by obstructing competition from beyond the frontier .

		This is the main use of a national boundary .

		The effect of the tariff is to keep the supply of goods down and thereby keep the price up , and so to bring reasonably satisfactory dividends to those special interests which deal in the protected articles of trade , at the cost of the underlying community .

		A protective tariff is a typical conspiracy in restraint of trade .

		It brings a relatively small , though abso - lutely large , run of free income to the special inter - ests which benefit by it , at a relatively , and abso - lutely , large cost to the underlying community , and so it gives rise to a body of vested rights and in - tangible assets belonging to these special interests .

		Of a similar character , in so far that in effect they are in the nature of sabotage conscientious withdrawal of efficiency are all manner of excise and revenue-stamp regulations ; although they are not always designed for that purpose .

		` Such would be , for instance , the partial or complete prohibition of alcoholic beverages , the regulation of the trade in tobacco , opium , and other deleterious narcotics , drugs , poisons , and high explosives .

		Of the same nature , in effect if not in intention , are such regu - lations as the oleomargarine law ; as also the un - necessarily costly and vexatious roatine of inspection imposed on the production of industrial -LRB- denatured -RRB- alcohol , which has inured to the benefit of certain business concerns that are interested in other fuels for use in internal-combustion engines ; so also the singularly vexatious ` and elaborately imbecile speci - fications that limit and discourage the use of the parcel post , for the benefit of the express companies and other carriers which have a vested interest in traffic of that kind .

		It is worth noting in the same connection , al - though it comes in from the other side of the case , that ever since the express companies have been taken over by the federal administration there has visibly gone into effect a comprehensive system of vexation and delay in the detail conduct of their traffic , so contrived as to discredit federal control of this traffic and thereby provoke a popular sentiment in favor of its early return to private control .

		Much the same state of things has been in evidence in the railway traffic under similar conditions .

		Sabotage is serviceable as a deterrent , whether in furtherance of the administration work or in contravention of it .

		In what has just been said there is , of course , no intention to find fault with any of these uses of sabotage .

		It is not a question of morals and good intentions .

		It is always to be presumed as a matter 346 THE DIAL
April 5	DATE	of course that the guiding spirit in all such govern - mental moves to regularize the , nation 's affairs , whether by restraint or by .

		incitement , is a wise solicitude for the nation 's enduring gain and security .

		All that can be said here is that many of these wise measures of restraint and incitement are in the nature of sabotage , and that in effect they habitually , though not invariably , inure to the benefit of certain vested interests ordinarily vested interests which bulk large in the ownership and control of the nation 's resources .

		That these measures are quite legitimate and presumably salutary , therefore , goes without saying .

		In effect they are measures for hindering traffic and industry at one point or an - other , which may often be a wise precaution .

		During the period of the war administrative measures in the nature of sabotage have been greatly extended in scope and kind .

		Peculiar and imperative exigencies have had to be met , and the staple means of meeting many of these new and exceptional exi - gencies has quite reasonably been something in the way of avoidance , disallowance , penalization , hind - rance , a conscientious withdrawal of efficiency from work that does not fall in with the purposes of the
Administration	ORGANIZATION	.

		Very much as is true in private business when a situation of doubt and hazard pre - sents itself , so also in the business of government at the present juncture of exacting demands and in - convenient limitations , the
Administration	ORGANIZATION	has been driven to expedients of disallowance and obstruc - tion with regard to some of the ordinary processes of life , as , for instance , in the non-essential industries .

		It has also appeared that the ordinary equipment and agencies for gathering and distributing news and other information have in the past developed a capacity far in excess of what can safely be per - mitted in time of war .

		The like is true for the ordinary facilities for public discussion of all sorts of public questions .

		The ordinary facilities , which may have seemed scant enough in time of peace and slack interest , had after all developed a capacity far beyond what the governmental traffic will bear in these uneasy times of war and negotiations , when men are very much on the alert to know what is going on .

		By a moderate use of the later improve - ments in the technology of transport and communi - cation , the ordinary means of disseminating informa - tion and opinions have grown so efficient that the traffic can no longer be allowed to run at full capacity during a period of stress in the business of government .

		Even the mail service has proved insufferably efficient , and a selective withdrawal of efficiency has gone into effect .

		To speak after the analogy of private business , it has been found best to disallow such use of the mail facilities as does not inure to the benefit of the administration in the way of good will and vested rights of usufruct .

		These peremptory measures of disallowance have attracted a wide and dubious attention ; but they have doubtless been of a salutary nature and in - tention , in some way which is not to be understood by outsiders that is to say , by citizens of the Re - public .

		An unguarded dissemination of information and opinions or an unduly frank canvassing of the relevant facts by these outsiders , will be a handicap on the
Administration	ORGANIZATION	's work , and may even defeat the
Administration	ORGANIZATION	's aims .

		At least so they say .

		Something of much the same color has been ob - served elsewhere/and in other times , so that all this nervously alert resort to sabotage on undesirable information and opinions is nothing novel , nor is it peculiarly democratic .

		The elder statesmen of the great monarchies , east and west , have long ago seen and approved the like .

		But these elder statesmen of the dynastic regime have gone to their work of sabotage on information because of a palpable division of sentiment between their government and the underlying population , such as does not exist in the advanced democratic commonwealths .

		The case of
Imperial Germany	LOCATION	during the period of the war is believed to show such a division of sentiment be - tween the government and the underlying popula - tion , and also to show how such a divided sentiment on the part of a distrustful and distrusted popula - tion had best be dealt with .

		The method approved by German dynastic experience is sabotage , of a somewhat free-swung character , censorship , embargo on communication , and also , it is confidently alleged , elaborate misinformation .

		Such procedure on the part of the dynastic states - men of the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	is comprehensible even to a lay - man .

		But how it all stands with those advanced democratic nations , like
America	LOCATION	, where the gov - ernment is the dispassionately faithful agent and spokesman of the body of citizens , and where there can consequently be no division of aims and senti - ment between the body of officials and any under - lying population all that is a more obscure and hazardous subject of speculation .

		Yet there has been censorship , somewhat rigorous , and there has been selective refusal of mail facilities , somewhat arbi - trary , in these democratic commonwealths also , and not least in
America	LOCATION	, freely acknowledged to be the most naively democratic of them all .

		And all the while one would like to believe that it all has somehow served some useful end .

		It is all v suffi - ciently perplexing .

		1919 THE DIAL 347 A Second Imaginary Conversation
GOSSE	PERSON	AND MOORE II vJTossE .

		Byron was largely conscious that his ` literary reputation depended on his acts rather than on his words .

		MOORE .

		But ,
Gosse	PERSON	, is n't that always so ?

		GOSSE .

		Shakespeare .

		MOORE .

		Had Shakespeare in that tiresome phrase trailed a pike in the Low Countries , his con - , temporaries would have appreciated him as they did
Ben Jonson	PERSON	; but he did nothing .

		GOSSE .

		Nor did the
Brontes	LOCATION	.

		MOORE .

		The Brontes had silhouette thrust upon them ; and on looking into
Jane Eyre	PERSON	after fifty years of absence , I have to confess my inability to discover the qualities that compelled you and
Swinburne	PERSON	to write of it as if it were a master - piece .

		In speaking of
Wuthering Heights	LOCATION	you were a little more careful you glided swiftly ; but in writing of
Jane Eyre	PERSON	you spoke of I have your exact words `` a sweep of tragic passion and the fusion of romantic intrigue with grave and sinister landscape , '' and will you deny that this is the kind of phrase that the pen drops when we yield to public opinion ?

		GOSSE .

		I am glad , flattered , that my History of English Literature was of use to you , but I may remark that it was intended primarily for the general reader .

		MOORE .

		I have no difficulty in understanding that you tried to keep purely personal opinions out of your book , judging , and judging wisely , that these would merely puzzle and embarrass the reader you had in your mind .


Jane Eyre	PERSON	was praised when you wrote by the best informed , and it is to your credit that you were not deceived by the literary babble of the time , nor driven to flouting public opinion , as you might well have been , but with your usual tact judged neither the place nor the moment to be propitious , and refrained .

		But now that the
Bronte	PERSON	epidemic is over , may I not seek to discover what your personal opinion ...
GOSSE	PERSON	.

		You can ask me any question .

		MOORE .

		I prefer not to ask any , but tell you the story of
Jane Eyre	PERSON	.

		GOSSE .

		But what is a book divested of its words ?

		MOORE .

		As much as a man is when divested of his flesh ...
Charlotte	LOCATION	relates that a widower with one daughter engages
Jane Eyre	PERSON	as governess , and that it is not very long before
Jane	PERSON	begins to notice that Mr.
Rochester	PERSON	pays her attentions and disappears from time to time into a distant part of the house .

		And the attentions
Rochester	LOCATION	pays to his daughter 's governess become more and more ' marked , and culminate in a proposal of marriage .

		But the maniac in the distant wing is Mrs.
Rochester	LOCATION	, and the marriage into which
Rochester	LOCATION	nearly succeeds in inveigling
Jane	PERSON	is stopped in the church , at the very altar , by the wife 's relations .

		Extenuating cir - cumstances may be found for the murderer and for the seducer , but it is hard to find any for the bigamist .

		And
Charlotte	LOCATION	must have been aware of this , and no doubt would have preferred
Roches	PERSON	- ter to have said , ``
Jane	PERSON	, my wife is a maniac and lives in the distant wing .

		But if you like to live with me I will try to make you happy and shall succeed , for I love you very dearly . ''

		It is possible to imagine an honorable man speaking these words to his daughter 's governess .

		I should not altogether like the bargain , because the parties are not bar - gaining on equal terms one is a governess and the other a man of wealth and position .

		But there can be no question that from a moral as well as from a literary point of view it would be preferable to bigamy .

		What happens then ?

		GOSSE .

		Jane returns from the church to the Hall , and I think I can aver that Mr.
Rochester	PERSON	is accepted as a penitent a penitent inasmuch as he regrets his design to inveigle his governess into a sham marriage , and I think he confesses that it would have been wiser to propose that
Jane	PERSON	should live with him outside of marriage .

		Jane might have accepted him on these terms if she had not been deceived by
Rochester	LOCATION	in the first instance , but having just escaped a sham marriage , she feels she can not remain at the
Hall	PERSON	, and runs away without clothes or money .

		MOORE .

		I think so , and takes refuge with Par - son .

		And with the help of Parson the story is somewhat tediously drawn out to the requisite three-volume length .

		The maniac sets fire to the house .

		She has to , for it is necessary to be rid of her so that
Rochester	LOCATION	may marry
Jane	PERSON	.

		At the same time , it behooves the novelist to show a noble soul in her hero , and the best plot that
Charlotte	LOCATION	can devise is , that in trying to save his wife 's life
Rochester	LOCATION	loses his sight from a falling beam .

		Even so ,
Charlotte	LOCATION	's difficulties are not cleared up , for , from the point of drawing-room entertainment , it would be a cheerless sort of story if
Rochester	LOCATION	did not recover his sight ; and as soon as he has been blind a couple of years he says to
Jane	PERSON	, ''
Jane	PERSON	, something seems to glitter on your dress . '' ''

		It is 14-8 THE DIAL
April 5	DATE	the chain you gave me ; your sight is coming back , '' or words to that effect .

		Sensation !

		I know that this story was hailed as a masterpiece ; but fifty years have passed over , and it appears to me that the time has come for somebody to say that
Jane Eyre	PERSON	is our old friend Mother Goose over again .

		If you have showed no signs of boredom while listening ,
Gosse	PERSON	, it is because you feel with me that
Jane Eyre	PERSON	is the typical English novel the story that every generation rewrites and that never fails to attract readers .

		The details of the story are many and various , each generation invents its own '' vocalization , '' but every version I have seen may be described as a rigmarole with something in it which gives the lady we sit next to at dinner an excuse for talking morality .

		The original story is written with more intensity than the variants , but nonsense is never really well written , and words avail little if the skeleton is not perfect .

		We who have been about a good deal have no difficulty in imagining the number of literary pens that a story like
Jane Eyre	PERSON	will set scratching , and the chatter it will set flow - ing at a dinner-table .

		As : It was , of course , wrong for
Rochester	LOCATION	to pass himself off as a bache - lor .

		All the same , his plight was a sad one , tied to a maniac wife ; and then the sudden switch off the divorce laws ought to be amended .

		But do you not fear that if .

		the marriage laws are loosened much further they might as well be done away with ?

		And are you quite sure that if he had confided his secret to
Jane	PERSON	in the first instance that she would have refused to live with him ?

		If the speakers are ac - quainted with French poetry , one of them is sure to quote the lines : Gloire dans 1 ` univers , dans les temps , a celui , Qui s ` immole a jamais pour le salut d'autrui !

		And the inherent desire of martyrdom in the al - most ugly , scrappy little woman with burning gray eyes will be described , and the tale told of her em - barrassment when she stepped across the threshold of
Smith Elder	ORGANIZATION	's drawing-room and found herself in the presence of six
London	LOCATION	celebrities , two of these standing on the hearth-rug , their coat tails lifted so that they might enjoy the blaze more thoroughly .

		The editor of the Cornhill was there .

		... At this moment an intrusive footman presses some dish on the speakers , and , having Helped themselves , the literary twain fall to think - ing how the six portly gentlemen must have enjoyed putting questions to
Charlotte	LOCATION	, asking how she had gotten that sufficient knowledge of life which enabled her to divine a man like
Rochester	LOCATION	.

		Charlotte and her sister had been to school in
Brussels	LOCATION	, and they returned home together after a year 's schooling ; but
Charlotte	LOCATION	was drawn back to
Brussels	LOCATION	, in her words , '' by an impulse that seemed to her irresistible '' and it was this irresistible im - pulse that enlarged the
Bronte	PERSON	silhouette almost indefinitely , and the discovery of letters continued the enlargement till it filled the entire literary horizon , and
Monsieur Heger	PERSON	, the schoolmaster , came to supply needy bookmakers with a subject suited to popular taste . ''

		If I could only rid myself of my conscience , '' she said , on her way to
Sainte Gudule	ORGANIZATION	.

		Penitents were passing in and out of the Confessional .

		Charlotte was a Protestant , and it required an uncontrollable impulse to propel her into the box .

		At first the Confessor would not hear her , she being a Protestant ; but she would not take '' No '' for an answer ; she confessed what ?

		If we only knew ; if the reporters had been able to get hold of that Confessor , there is reason to suppose that we should be discussing
Charlotte	LOCATION	's morals till we ascended to the Judgment Seat .

		But if Char - lotte had transgressed ?

		If she had , the veracity of the confession would have been impugned .

		... .

		Even the present war would not be sufficient to quench the desire to discuss whether
Charlotte	LOCATION	held the Professor 's hand or the Professor held hers .

		It broke out again in the Times , and not more than two years ago .

		You saw the correspondence ,
Gosse	PERSON	?

		GOSSE .

		No , I did n't , but I like listening to you ; go on .

		MOORE .

		Some wandering gossip or a newly dis - covered letter blew up the dying embers of this controversy somebody died , somebody confessed , or new letters were discovered .

		I have forgotten , if I ever knew .

		I came upon a middle letter , and was struck by the almost passionate tenacity with which the writer clung to the belief that
Charlotte	LOCATION	's life had always been gray and dull , and that noth - ing had ever happened in it to redeem the monotony of ill-health and teaching .

		We know that we arc not virtuous , we know that we can not be virtuous , but we are anxious to believe that somebody else is virtuous .

		I suppose it can not be otherwise , the doctrine of Atonement having taken such a hold on us .

		But this explanation did not satisfy me alto - gether , and at odd times the thought returned that there must be more in it than the instinct of the individual , and seeking for the instinct of the hive , I said to myself one day : Of course , the whole national attitude regarding the Brontes would alter if it could be proved that she had held the school - master 's hand .

		GOSSE .

		You 're in excellent form today , and I 'm sorry to interrupt you , but I , too , am being poked up by a constantly recurring thought and can not help remembering your saying that I - glided swiftly over
Wuthering Heights	LOCATION	, like one anxious not to commit himself to any definite opinion for or
1919	DATE	THE DIAL against the book , and I do not think I am going too far if I say that your suggestion was that my pri - vate judgment was held in check by the prevalent literary opinion of the time headed by
Swinburne	PERSON	, who ...
MOORE	PERSON	.

		It seems to me quite reasonable to sup - pose that a man writing a history of English litera - ture must refrain from challenging received opinions .

		I thought I had made that sufficiently clear .

		GOSSE .

		Yes ; quite plain , and it is no doubt as you say .

		I did , of course , try to exclude eccentric opinions -LRB- I use the word in its grammatical sense -RRB- , for these would only embarrass and confuse ; but you are in a different position , and will , no doubt , undo the mischief I have done by a clear pronounce - ment .

		How does
Wuthering Heights	LOCATION	strike you ?

		As a masterpiece ?

		MOORE .

		As it appears to me , those who com - mitted their critical reputations to the pronounce - ment that
Wuthering Heights	LOCATION	was a masterpiece would have done well to consider the word master - piece .

		The word is sufficiently explicit a work executed by one who is a master in his craft ; and to be a master in any craft , an apprenticeship is necessary .

		Emily was born in
1818	DATE	and died in
1848	DATE	, and presumably
Wuthering Heights	LOCATION	was written some years earlier shall we say at six or seven and twenty ?

		Well , masterpieces are not pro- duced at that age , not even by
Raphael	PERSON	, for the simple reason that nobody is a master of his craft , whatever it may be , till he has practiced it for ten years , not even if it be the humble craft of prose narrative .

		And a casual glance into the book tells those who know how to read that it is just what ' a girl of genius , unpracticed in her craft and with - out experience of lifej might write in a lonely par - sonage over against a
Yorkshire	LOCATION	heath wild and violent imaginings shot through with glimpses of real beauty .

		A glimpse of beauty her vision of Heathcliff surely is a man haunted by the memory of
Catherine	PERSON	, his enemy 's wife , who died many years ago , more than twenty have passed over , but for
Heathcliff	ORGANIZATION	there is nobody in the world but
Catherine	LOCATION	.

		She is never far away , often by his elbow ; she has come to speak , but she utters no word , but signs to him , and he rises immediately from the meal and follows her across the desolate heath .

		In vain , needless to say .

		The hallucination continues ; he sees her in every face he looks upon , and we feel with him that only death can release him from the torture of the deception , forever re - curring in a hundred different aspects , and always failing him .

		Did Emily mean the wraith to stand for a symbol of life itself ?

		She hardly knew .

		She wrote as we dream .

		GOSSE .

		You think that
Emily	PERSON	was the genius ?

		MOORE .

		The word is inapplicable to prose writers under forty , and more than a single work is necessary , and there is nothing in
Wuthering Heights	LOCATION	to show that
Emily Bronte	PERSON	's talent would have developed .

		The one that might have developed into a fm writer was
Anne	PERSON	.

		She wrote a book called The
Tenant of Wildfell Hall	ORGANIZATION	, a baby book , it is true , but the memory of it lingers in me to this day ; a story of illegitimate love that came to naught , and for no valid reason that I could discover on my way to
Castle Carra	ORGANIZATION	, whither I went not a little scared lest perchance I had been born into a world in which nobody transgressed .

		It is with my boyish dread of a sinless world that she is associated , and with pity for her early death coming before any taste of life .

		A virgin 's death is the very saddest .

		Anne revealed her sadness to me , and I take this opportunity of paying my debt .

		GOSSE .

		You have thrown every sort of stone against the Brontes , and I can tell by your face that you think you brought down
Jane Eyre	PERSON	with that last one a vindictive summary of her book .

		A silly story no doubt it is , but many silly stories abound in beautiful pages and
Jane Eyre	PERSON	is not an exception .

		It is many years since I read it , but I am still haunted by a memory of the twain in a dewy orchard or garden and a dialogue that lasts all night and that ends , I think , with the dawn .

		You may have forgotten these pages or half forgot - ten as I have ; if so , you will do well to read them again , for I think you would admire them .

		MOORE .

		Your memory is better than mine in this instance .

		GOSSE .

		Thank you for this tribute , which it is an honor to receive from one of prodigious mem - ory , though of slight reading .

		And now there is a point of criticism which it seems to me you have overlooked .

		It is that of all the novels written in mid-Victorian years , the
Brontes	PERSON	' are the only ones that retain any faint vitality .

		You can read
Jane Eyre	PERSON	and
Wuthering Heights	LOCATION	more easily than
Lytton	LOCATION	or Disraeli , more easily than the late Vic - torians ,
Trollope	LOCATION	, even more easily than
Dickens	PERSON	,
Thackeray	PERSON	, and
George Eliot	PERSON	.

		I gather from your silence that I have guessed rightly .

		As a critic of English fiction ; it behooves you to consider how this has come to pass .

		But you do not seem to be ready with an answer .

		Perhaps you will allow me to tell you your charge against the English novel is that it has been , from the hour of its birth to the present year , concerned with the surface of life rather than with the depths and need we hook further for the reason why the novels we enjoyed in our boyhood are rejected by the younger genera -
35	DATE	THE DIAL April 5 tion ?

		The great bulk of men and women know life only by the waves , and the popular novelist concerns himself with what attracts his public : the surface of life , all the little - odds and oddments , the picturesque follies of the hour , the tricks of speech and manner , the ideas of the moment .

		His audience is delighted .

		He is presenting life as it appears to them .

		But all these waves and wave - lets sink into the deep , disappear , and when they have gone , the books go with them .

		Can it be else ?

		MOORE .

		But the Brontes were popular during their lifetime .

		GOSSE .

		To some extent , but it was not until the nineties that they met with any intelligent appreciation .

		MOORE .

		I am beginning to see whither your argument is tending : that the Brontes wrote about life in its essentials , which , like the depths of the sea , do not change .

		GOSSE .

		The parsonage over against the lonely heath excited your derision , but if I may venture to say so , unduly .

		Mr.
Arthur Mellows	PERSON	is never wholly wrong , but he can not : explain himself .

		That parsonage and that heath which he photographed so often are not interesting in themselves as he thought , but because they saved the Brontes from the English literary tradition , that in prose narrative life as only a thin upper crust is , shall I say , representable .

		MOORE .

		The Brontes , knowing nothing of so - cial life , were forced to look into the depths .

		GOSSE .

		There may be less character in their books than there is in
Lytton	LOCATION	or Disraeli , but there 's more humanity .

		MOORE .

		I see ; and that is why
Swinburne	PERSON	wrote his monograph .

		But you record the fact in your biography that when he summoned you to hear it he wearied in his reading and laid it aside so that he might read you his novel a novel that he never wearied of , but which you and Mr.
Wise	PERSON	have decided shall never be published .

		GOSSE .

		Outside his gift no man is very wise ; and as I have often mentioned in my biography of the great poet , whom I was fortunate enough to know intimately ,
Swinburne	PERSON	lost all receptive power at the age of forty .

		After forty his mind was closed to new ideas ; it was less flexible , less elastic .

		I think that in my biography the word ossification almost occurs .

		I have no wish to .

		with - draw it .

		In his later critical writings he never argued , explained , or analyzed .

		He merely ham - mered .

		The noise he made was sometimes ridicu - lous , as is shown in the sentence in which he called George Eliot '' an
Amazon	LOCATION	thrown sprawling over the crupper of her spavined and spur-galled Peg - asus . ''

		And a hundred sentences as silly and as ugly could be culled from his prose writings .

		I quote this phrase though it gives me pain to repeat it , for I believe that the origin of the monograph on
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	may be traced to his desire to write something that would give pain to
George Eliot	PERSON	and to her admirers , rather than to any gen - uine admiration of
Jane Eyre	PERSON	or
Shirley	PERSON	.

		MOORE .

		He liked
Dickens	PERSON	in his youth , and duririg middle age and old age he read
Dickens	PERSON	through from end to end every three years , from the Sketches by
Boz	PERSON	to the Mystery of
Edwin Drood	PERSON	.

		You tell us that , and more than that that he read
Dickens	PERSON	aloud to Watts-Dunton three times .

		The
Pines	ORGANIZATION	needs a biographer a subject made to your hand ,
Gosse	PERSON	.

		And now I 'll tell you something you do not know .

		It was proposed , whether by
Frank Harris	PERSON	or another I am not quite sure , but during his editorship , that
Swinburne	PERSON	should write an appreciation of
Dickens	PERSON	for the Fortnightly .

		But the paper was never written , on account of the rejection of a poem , a ballad with '' The wind wears o'er the heather '' for refrain .

		Have you met with the manuscript of this poem in your researches ?

		GOSSE .

		I do not remember it , and Wise an , d I have gone through all the papers carefully .

		Are you sure that the poem was by
Swinburne	PERSON	?

		MOORE .

		I was told it was by
Swinburne	PERSON	.

		It certainly seemed to me rather casual , and I doubt that the appreciation would have been of much literary value if it had been written .

		It would have been too much in the
Pauline	LOCATION	manner , asseveration upon asseveration .

		But let us not stray from the point of dutiful criticism , and as I am a little weary of fault finding will you confide to me your best thoughts on Dickens ?

		I thirst for some whole - hearted praise .

		GOSSE .

		I look upon
Dickens	PERSON	as the first man of English genius who gave the whole of his genius to the novel-reader ; he was able to do this , for he was without general culture , and as
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	pointed out , two things are necessary for the birth of ar , t the man and the moment .

		Ypu have talked to me so much about English prose narrative that I find it a little difficult to disen - tangle my ideas from yours .

		But if you will have patience , I think I shall be able to do so .

		It seems to me certain that in
Dickens	LOCATION	we got the man of genius , and it seerns to me if not as certain , at least arguable , that the moment of ` his coming was not propitious .

		By the moment we must under - stand not only the literary tradition that prevailed in his time , but the circumstances of his life .

		Dick - ens was a -RRB- man of the people , and was without that school and university education which liberated IQI9 THE DIAL 35 1 Landor and
Swinburne	PERSON	from the narrow sympathies and latter prejudices of the Victorian age ; added to which , he had to get his living , and he could only do this by supplying the drawing-room with en - tertainment .

		You see I accept your definition of the English novel ; if he had not been a man of genius he would have continued the
Lytton	LOCATION	and Disraeli modes and we should have more - Disraeli modes and we should have had more historical flourishes , verbose politics , sentimental rhodomontades , fop - pery , and high living .

		Instead of these , we got the middle and lower classes , of which English litera - ture was hardly aware before
Dickens	PERSON	introduced them !

		You would prefer that he should have laid less stress on superficial markings superficial is perhaps unnecessary on markings , and you will tell me that whereas Balzac stands head and shoulders above
Daumier	PERSON	,
Gavarni	PERSON	, and
Monnier	PERSON	; such char - acters as
Micawber	LOCATION	,
Stiggins	PERSON	,
Dombey	LOCATION	, and
Little Nell	PERSON	do not represent anything deeper , any deeper humanity than
Cruikshank	PERSON	and
Phiz	LOCATION	.

		I answer you and I think fairly , that though a great man is always greater than his environment , he is born of it and shares its qualities , good and evil .

		Balzac was fa - vored by circumstance ; he lived in a great moment of literary revival , one as favorable to French litera - ture as the Elizabethan age was to English litera - ture .

		But in spite of these magnificent advantages , the great Tourainian was not , as yourself will ad - mit , free from melodrama and sentimentality .

		Hand on your heart , is
Vautrin	PERSON	better than
Bill Sykes	PERSON	, and are the w r orst pages in Little Dorrit worse than certain pages in La Femme de Trente Ans ?

		MOORE .

		Which of
Dickens	PERSON	' books do you like best ?

		GOSSE .

		On the whole ,
Pickwick	ORGANIZATION	, for we recog - nize the English middle classes in Mr.
Pickwick	PERSON	, and it is an achievement to discover an acceptable symbol .

		In the same book we have
Sam Weller	PERSON	, and we discover in him the mind of the lower classes , their humor and good nature .

		A man that has set forth two figures as typical as these can not be dismissed as unworthy of our literature merely because his Travels in
Italy	LOCATION	do not fulfill the as - pirations of the young idea .

		For the sake of Mr.
Pickwick	PERSON	and his valet ,
Dickens	PERSON	is forgiven , at least by me for the somewhat , shall I say lack-luster buffoonery , of the breach of promise case Mrs.
Bardell	PERSON	, Sergeant Buzfuz , all and sundry .

		We for - get these faults , puerilities , if you will remember that if
France	LOCATION	's gift was the novelist ,
England	LOCATION	re - ceived the incomparable poet .

		Of what are you thinking ?

		MOORE .

		Do not be so prickly ... of what you are saying and that if our novelist had spent his evenings in the
Nouvelle Athenes	LOCATION	, he would have written prose narratives worthy of our poet - ical literature , creating characters that in their seriousness would compare with Le
Pere Goriot	PERSON	and
Philippe	PERSON	, in Un Menage de Garcon .

		But if he had gone to
France	LOCATION	and spent his evenings as you suggest , we should not have had
Dickens	PERSON	but another man .

		His talent was more natural , more spontaneous , than any he would have met in
France	LOCATION	.

		He had more talent than
Flaubert	LOCATION	,
Zola	LOCATION	,
Goncourt	LOCATION	, Daudet ; but he would have learned from them the value of seriousness .

		A quick , receptive mind like his would have understood that a convict waiting in a marsh for a boy to bring him a file with which he may file himself from his irons is not a subject for humor .

		He need not have spent the whole of his youth on the
Boulevard Exterieur	ORGANIZATION	.

		A few years would have been sufficient to dissipate the vile English tradition that humor is a literate quality .

		He would have learned that it is more commercial than literary , and that , if it be introduced in large quantities , all life dies out of the narrative .

		A living and moving story related by a humorist very soon becomes a thing of jeers and laughter , signify - ing nothing .

		We must have humor , of course , but the use we must make of our humor is to avoid in - troducing anything into the narrative that shall dis - tract the reader from the beauty , the mystery , and the \ pathos of the life we live in this world .

		Who - soever keeps humor under lock and key is read in the next generation , if he writes well , for to write well without the help of humor is the supreme test .

		I should like to speak in my essay of the abuse of humor , but it would be difficult to make this abuse plain to a public so uneducated as ours , whose liter - ary sensibilities are restricted to a belief that some jokes are better than others , but that any joke is better than no joke .

		I , do not wish to libel the daily or weekly press , but it would seem to me fhat we have not a critic among us who is yet prepared to say that humor is but a crutch by the aid of which almost any writer can totter a little way .

		I am afraid I am repeating myself , but the matter is of such literary importance that a repetition may be forgiven me .

		Looking back , I catch sight of the Athenaeum , our first literary journal in the eigh - ties , and I am not exaggerating when I say that it must have published some hundreds of articles en - forcing the doctrine that humor is a primary con - dition of prose narrative , without its occurring to anybody , though all the best pens in
London	LOCATION	were writing for the
Athenaeum	ORGANIZATION	in the eighties , that
Jean Jacques Rousseau	PERSON	attained a unique reality in literature by abstention from humor ; I only remem - ber one smiling sentence in his Confessions and that lasts but a minute at the end of the journey that .

		Jean Jacques undertakes for the benefit of his health .

		THE
DIAL April 5 GOSSE	ORGANIZATION	.

		A great book like the Confessions pro- vokes different remembrances in all of us ; and I agree with you that the introduction of humor into the Confessions would have deprived the book of its high literary quality .

		A very little humor would have turned a great and beautiful book into a mere vulgarity .

		Only a very great writer would have abstained from humor , and one shudders at the thought of what the scene in the garden would have become if
Jean Jacques	PERSON	had allowed the faintest smile to curl the end of a sentence .

		And what a feat this scene is !

		Madame de Wareus calls
Jean Jacques	PERSON	into the garden to confide to him her project for his sexual education .

		She appreciates the boy 's embarrassment , telling him that she will give him eight days to think the matter over , and the char - acter that emerges when she folds him in her arms is a new one in literature the material mistress .

		MOORE .

		It is strange that the admirable lesson given by
Jean Jacques	PERSON	was never laid to heart in
England	LOCATION	.

		GOSSE .

		I would make good some omissions .

		MOORE .

		Pray make good my omissions ?

		GOSSE .

		I would point out that we look in vain for humor in the Greek and Latin poets ;
Aristo	ORGANIZATION	- phanes was an ironist rather than a humorist , and the same may be said of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		The grave - diggers ' scene in
Hamlet	LOCATION	was not written to set the audience giggling , any more than the scene be - tween Cleopatra and the fruit-seller .

		These scenes and the pattef of the porter in
Macbeth	LOCATION	were writ - ten to delay the action , so that the spectator might have time to meditate on the tragedies that were on their way to accomplishment .

		The same can not be said of the comic scenes relating to the building of the wall in the
Midsummer Night	ORGANIZATION	's Dream .

		They may have been humorous originally , but I think it will be allowed that if the authority of Shakespeare were withdrawn from them they would be resented , and rightly .

		But once more we are dropping into Shakespearean controversy .

		And to bring the con - versation back , I will say we have strayed into
Tom Tiddler	PERSON	's ground ... No , you must not inter - rupt me .

		You asked me to make good your omis - sions ... The desire to giggle is a very imper - .

		sonal quality .

		But there is another humor , one which saves us from urging our ideas upon our friends with undue insistence , and this is a humor which I appreciate , and look upon as the rudder whereby we steer our course through life .

		I should like to continue a little further , but we have lighted our lanterns , and are searching for a man who has written prose narrative in English seriously .

		So far as we have gone we have discovered one woman , and it will be a pity if we can not find a literary mate or concomitant for her .

		I gather that neither
Dickens	PERSON	nor
Thackeray	PERSON	attracts you .

		Even so , one must repel you more than the other =
MOORE	PERSON	.

		If
Dickens	PERSON	had not come into our literature we should lose more than a certain num - ber of books , something of ourselves , for
Dickens	PERSON	has become part of our perceptions , and as the world exists in our perceptions , he has enlarged the world for us .

		But can as much be said for
Thackeray	PERSON	?

		If he had not come into our literature we should lose some books which I will allow to be admirable , so that hitches and hindrances in our conversation may be avoided .

		But I do not think that we should lose any more .

		Vanity Fair , for instance , seems to me implicit in the literature that preceded it in
Fielding	LOCATION	, to whom he has often been compared , and not without reason , as it appears to me .

		Almost any reader acquainted with the first writer would be struck with the similarity of mind on reading the second , and would feel that
Thackeray	PERSON	had modeled his style on Fielding 's , adapting it to the temper of Victorian readers , robbing it of its gusts , and im - proving the spacing and ordination of the different parts .

		It seems to me that the same interest in the surface of life marks both writers : both are equally unable or unwilling to look into the depths ; one re - lated
Squire Western	ORGANIZATION	's drunken bouts and his pas - sion for hunting , and the other
Pitt Crawley	PERSON	's habit of talking to
Horrocks	PERSON	the butler during dinner .

		To look below the surface bored them .

		Thackeray 's surfaces are often admirable , but that sense of the eternal which gives mystery and awe to a work of art was unknown to him , so it seems to me .

		GOSSE .

		You said that
Tom Jones	PERSON	was a book without seasons , without trees , without flowers , without a storm cloud above the landscape , or a rag in it .

		Might not the same strictures be directed with equal force against Vanity Fair ?

		MOORE .

		Yes indeed .

		Both books lack intimacy of thought and feeling .

		No one sits by the fire and thinks what his or her past has been and welcomes the approach of a familiar bird or animal .

		I do not remember any dog , cat , or parrot in Vanity .

		Fair , and I am almost sure that
Tom Jones	PERSON	is with - out one .

		A caged blackbird or thrush is a painful sight , but the parrot has chosen domestication , like the cat and dog .

		Some of our homebirds love us , the jackdaw very often ; the raven prefers the warm outhouse to the windy scarp perhaps .

		However this may be , he who loves animals and birds is more human than he who does n't .

		GOSSE .

		Grip loved
Barnaby Rudge	PERSON	's shoulder , and was with him always in the
Gordon	PERSON	riots and afterwards , I think , in prison .

		Can you remember what he said ?

		MOORE .

		Unfortunately I can not , it 's too long ago .

		I have forgotten their names but I am con -
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 353 scious of the presence of dogs and cats in
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	' pages .

		GOSSE .

		There is Gyp in
David Copperfield	PERSON	, who ekes out the character of Dora very happily , and we might think of many others .

		MOORE .

		Dickens ' description of
Bill Sikes	PERSON	' dog shows that the writer had observed dogs and was in sympathy with their instincts .

		Altogether
Dick	PERSON	- ens ' mind was richer , more abundant than
Thack	PERSON	- eray 's ;
Thackeray	PERSON	's always seemed to me a meager , sandy mind , an essentially ungenerous soil , that pro- duced only starvelings .

		GOSSE .

		But this description of
Thackeray	PERSON	's mind is hardly in agreement with his characters only the writing is inferior .

		MOORE .

		What is in the mind transpires ; he was interested only , in life , the drift and letter of social life , always pleased and proud to relate that a Major or a Colonel arrived at his club at a certain hour , and hardly less so to tell us how a lady of high degree is driven to satisfy her milliner and dress - maker by concluding an armistice , paying something on account , the foe to wait for full settlement un - til the daughter 's marriage is brought off .

		In Pen - dennis and The Newcomes a booby is presented deftly , but the conception of a booby is very com - monplace .

		Boobies in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Balzac	LOCATION	, and
Tourgenev	PERSON	are men of genius as well as boobies .

		GOSSE .

		Forgive me for interrupting you , but it may be well that I should remind you that the ab - sence of interest in Nature which you deplore in
Thackeray	DATE	is not shared by any first-rate writer in modern or antique times .

		It has become the fash - ion to say that we moderns discovered Nature , but is this true ?


Vergil	ORGANIZATION	told the story of the fields as well as
Wordsworth	PERSON	, and if the early Irish poets are remarkable for anything , it is for their love of Nature .

		The only great writer that I can call to mind who never mentioned a tree or flower , a field or hill , is
Frangois Villon	PERSON	.

		MOORE .

		It is true that flowers and trees and familiar animals find perhaps as small a place in
Villon	LOCATION	's poems as in
Thackeray	LOCATION	's novels .

		But Vil - lon was not lacking in human sympathies .

		Now if I remember The Newcomes and Pendennis correctly ,
Thackeray	PERSON	's implicit approval of the attitude adopted by his '' good '' women towards Lady Clara High - gate and the porter 's daughter whom they find nursing Pendennis shows that human beings were as remote from his sympathies as were the flowers and trees and fields .

		What he did understand though , were prejudices and conventions , and that is why his novels seem old-fashioned to the younger generation .

		GOSSE .

		But his characters represent something more than the conventions of his time .


Becky Sharpe	PERSON	represents an adventuress prise sur le vif .

		MOORE .

		An adventuress according to the liter - ary canons of the fifties an adventuress without a temperament , which is very much the same as a sol - dier without courage .

		GOSSE .

		But I can imagine a man lacking in physical courage , yet a very good soldier .

		MOORE .

		Through a moral courage that over - comes physical weakness .

		But it is not so easy to imagine an adventuress overcoming her distaste for love from a sense of duty .

		GOSSE .

		Madame Re ` cannier is reputed to have been a cold woman , yet she attracted men .

		A cold woman leading men on , making them miserable , , and taking her pleasure in their misery is conceivable .

		MOORE .

		Quite conceivable ; but no such excel - lent and subtle conception of devilish malignity crossed
Thackeray	PERSON	's mind , nor had he in mind the great adventuress , she whose weapon and defense is her sex .

		His mind did not move on grand , nat - ural lines ; he imagined a little intriguing , middle - class woman , determined to get on , and he was in - terested , in her tricks , how she won over the women when they came into the drawing-room after dinner , how she bamboozled the younger Sir
Pitt	PERSON	.

		So far he was in sympathy with his subject ; but as it ap - pears to me , his interest in human nature did not compel him to ask himself any essential question about her .

		In writing once about a celebrated passage in St.
Paul I	PERSON	said , '' No man is known to us till he has revealed his sex to us , '' and with the alteration of one word the same phrase will ser-ve me here .

		Thackeray in writing of
Becky Sharpe	PERSON	followed the English tradition .

		He observed , and abstained from meditation ; he was satisfied with externals , and the human nature that belongs to all of us our humanity was unknown to him .

		It did not occur to him to humanize
Becky Sharpe	PERSON	by expatiating in her religious feelings , in her super - stitions .

		Mankind is incurably superstitious and one might almost say therefore Thackeray instinc - tively avoided the subject .

		He liked men and women better than mankind .

		He liked character better than humanity ; but in omitting any superstition from
Becky Sharpe	PERSON	's character he was sinning against the type ; no class or type is more likely to seek counsel in oracles , to believe in their line of luck , than the adventurer and the adventuress ; but never once does he send
Becky Sharpe	PERSON	running to a Bond Street fortune-teller .

		GOSSE .

		You have clung somewhat tediously to your idea that the English novelist never looks into the depths of life ... and I have been wait - ing all the while for a quotation from
Thackeray	PERSON	on this very question .

		He says somewhere , and in Vanity Fair I will not answer for the exact words 354 THE DIAL
April 5	DATE	of the sentence but he addresses the reader and points out to him that nothing appears above the waves , and that if he choose to look under them , well , he ,
Thackeray	PERSON	is not responsible for what may be seen there .

		MOORE .

		What terrible thing will he perceive ?

		An adultery in
Mayfair !	ORGANIZATION

		The magnificent Raw - don overthrowing the
Marquis	PERSON	on the hearth-rug , and flinging the jewels , the tokens of his wife 's sin , in the nobleman 's face .

		GOSSE .

		A very theatrical scene , no doubt ; alto - gether false , no doubt , but it is not easy to say what
Rawdon	PERSON	should have done in the circumstances un - less , indeed , he had adopted the grammatical pose related in the Chronicles of French gallantries touch - ing le Marquis de la Perdrigonde who on returning home found his wife in the arms of a lover , an Englishman .

		I 'm wrong , he was a German , and it was therefore quite natural that he should strike an attitude as soon as he was dressed and declare his intention to leave the room .

		`` II fallait que je m ` en aille '' he said . ''

		II fallait que je m ` en allasse , '' the Marquis de la Perdrigonde corrected .

		This grammatical unraveling of an awkward situation is not possible in
English	LOCATION	, owing to the leanness of our verbal system .

		But though our language is possessed of little grammar , the possibility of writing so as to defy criticism may be doubted .

		Landor took pleasure in reproving the ghost of
Cicero	LOCATION	for mis - takes in
Latin	LOCATION	; in the person of Home Tooke he reproved Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	, forcing him into an admis - sion that he had constructed a sentence negligently ; and it was only the other day that you came here with a bunch of mistakes gathered from
Landor	ORGANIZATION	and Pater and myself ; if I were to search your works I should not return with empty hands .

		But the mistakes of the illustrious ones , and perhaps my own obscure errors , are , if I may say so , different from the vulgarisms which are to be found in
Thackeray	LOCATION	, who perhaps is guilty of more than any writer of equal importance .

		MOORE .

		But is he important ?

		GOSSE .

		I am afraid we shall have to leave the centuries to decide that point .

		Meanwhile a word upon a personal matter , if it be not judged unseemly to interrupt a purely literary discussion for so slight a cause .

		You reproved me for my praise of
Jane Eyre	PERSON	saying that I yielded to popular clamor , but whatever truth there may be in this contention , you will allow that my acceptance of
Thackeray	PERSON	as a writer in keeping with the high tradition of our literature is fainthearted .

		We pass easily from
Thackeray	LOCATION	to
Trollope	LOCATION	.

		-LSB- To be continued -RSB-
GEORGE MOORE	PERSON	.

		Roads to Freedom fj ERTRAND RUSSELL is one of the encouraging phenomena of this disintegrating age .

		Some of us heard him at
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	in
1915	DATE	, speajdng with a delicate Emersonian ethereality on Our Knowledge of the External World : for more than an hour he assured us that the benches on which we sat really existed ; and then he melted timidly away into a neighboring office haven .

		He was a thin , dry speci - men of a man , innocuously academic ; surely not many of us suspected that this already reverend epistemolog -LRB- he is nearly fifty -RRB- would ever perpe - trate any startling mischief in the political world .

		We heard that he belonged to one of the '' noblest '' families of
England	LOCATION	; that , being a second son , he had escaped an earldom by an heir 's breadth ; and that he had taken to a weird infinitesimal-calculus philosophy , presumably because philosophy , being still for the most part useless , was still for the most part respectable .

		And then a year later came Jus - tice in War-Time , full of unprofessorial passion and pertinence .

		Many of us ignored the new vol - ume ; an author 's followers do not readily permit him to deviate from his past .

		When , after another year , an American publisher brought out
Principles of Social Reconstruction	ORGANIZATION	under the misleading and sensational title , Why Men Fight
Russell	PERSON	lost a small public and found a large one ; for now he was speaking not only to intellects , which are rare , but to hearts , which are everywhere .

		The Haves read the book because it psychoanalyzed them painless - ly ; the Have-nots read it because here was their eternal hope come back to them in language elo - quent as sincerity and clear as the eyes of love .

		All the world looked up , like a multiplied
Diogenes	PERSON	, at this
Daniel	PERSON	come to judgment ; what could such a naively honest fellow be doing in this mad world , at this maddest of all mad times ?

		One almost en - vied him his honesty ; for honesty is a luxury which most of us can ill afford .

		Since then the romance has taken form with the few items that have slipped through the fingers of the censor : that the timid philosopher had all the governing classes of
England	LOCATION	scared to pettiness , and had been quarantined to prevent the spread of his curious infection ; that he had not been allowed to come again to
America	LOCATION	, for fear that even an ocean voyage would not make him give up his new philosophy ; that in a more or less gentlemanly way
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 355 he was kept in semi-bondage , like another
Galileo	ORGANIZATION	, also insisting that the world does move .

		He was lost to us for a while , silent in a shouting world ; until last month , when we were told how the strikers at
Glasgow	LOCATION	asked
Russell	PERSON	to come and ad - dress them ; how the British Government so feared the little man 's power of thought and truth that they forbade him to go ; how
Robert Smillie	PERSON	spoke instead -LRB- with unwonted purity of diction -RRB- , reading from a manuscript ; and having finished said , '' That , ladies and gentlemen , is what Mr.
Russell	PERSON	would have said if he had been permitted to be present here tonight . ''

		And now comes another
Russell	PERSON	book , Proposed Roads to Freedom : Social - ism , Anarchism , and Syndicalism -LRB-
Holt	ORGANIZATION	,
$ .1.50	MONEY	-RRB- , and from a stray sentence here and there we per - ceive that the philosopher has borne his segrega - tion philosophically : '' Few are able to see through the apparent evils of an outcast 's Jife to the inner joy that comes of faith and creative hope . ''

		It is a quiet book , dealing though it does with movements that are making no little noise at pres - ent in the world .

		There is first a chapter on socialism , aptly defined as '' the advocacy of com - munal ownership of land and capital '' ; there is a critical analysis of the central concepts of Marxism economic interpretation , class war , and the con - centration of capital ; and there is the usual account of the break-up of socialism into state capitalism on the one hand and syndicalism on the other .

		Russell points out the difficulties of a socialism resting on the '' democratic '' state as at present organized : ' The actual experience of democratic representative government is very disillusioning , '' he writes in his polite way ; and the notion of the state as universal employer is about as pleasant as the idea of conscrip - tion . ''

		Socialists ... imagine that the Social - ist
State	ORGANIZATION	will be governed by men like those who now advocate it .

		This is , of course , a delusion .

		... Those who hold power after the reform has been carried out are likely to belong , in the main , to the ambitious executive type which has in all ages - possessed itself of the government of the nations .

		And this type has never shown itself tol - erant of opposition or friendly to freedom . ''

		There follows a sympathetic account of anarch - ism as taught by
Bakunin	PERSON	and
Kropotkin	PERSON	; the indi - cations of this chapter are that
Russell	PERSON	has , during ; his domestic exile , re-read
Kropotkin	PERSON	, and has al - most been carried away by the sweet reasonableness of the man .

		Like
Jefferson	PERSON	,
Russell	PERSON	thinks that a violent uprising now and then is a good national tonic , and has some value as educative drama ; but '' in labor movements generally , success through vio - lence can hardly be expected except in circumstances where success without violence is attainable . ''

		Rus - sell inclines much more towards the syndicalism of Pelloutier and Lagardelle than toward the socialism of
Hyndman	PERSON	and Wells and
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	; but he wonders whether the solidarity of labor on which the move - ment would base itself is not even more of a myth than the general strike .

		Many English working - men , he points out , have been made conservative by the investments which they or their unions have placed in capitalistic enterprises , as well as by their share , however slight , in the benefit accruing from the exploitation of backward countries .

		And in
America	LOCATION	'' the older skilled workers , largely Ameri - can born , have long been organized in the
American Federation of Labor	ORGANIZATION	under Mr.
Gompers	PERSON	.

		These represent an aristocracy of labor .

		They tend to work with the employers against the great mass of unskilled immigrants , and they can not be regarded as forming part of anything that could truly be called a labor movement . ''

		This statement may appear extreme , in the light of the recent semi - syndicalistic proposals of the American railway unions ; but it is helpful to see how matters
Ameri	PERSON	- can look * at a distance which lends perspective to the view .

		Russell concludes that syndicalism takes account of men only as producers , just as state so - cialism takes account of men only as consumers ; and accepts the plan of the Guild Socialists to recon - cile the two . ''

		The system which they advocate is , I believe , the best hitherto proposed , and the one most likely to secure liberty without constant ap - peals to violence . '' ''

		To secure liberty '' that to
Russell	PERSON	is the su - preme purpose of all political organization and thought .

		He approaches the social question always from the point of view of the artist , and tests each plan by asking '' What will it do to art ? ''

		He con - tinues to use as the center of his political thinking the distinction between the creative and the posses - sive dispositions ; and his Utopia is a system of checks to possession and incentives to creation .

		Un -
der Guild Socialism	ORGANIZATION	, he thinks , men will come to be valued not by the quantity but by the quality of their product ; there will be a minimum wage for all , even for those who will not work ; the creative impulse , the constructive disposition , may be trusted to keep all but a few men busy -LRB- but , one wonders , busy at -LRB- he work that is most needed , or only at the work that is most pleasant ? -RRB-

		; every industry will be controlled by the men engaged in it , except in its external relations , which will fall for adjudi - cation to some central body ; there will be very lit - tle government , very little law or compulsion ; an international economic congress will take the place of war as the arbiter in commercial and territorial disputes ; invention will be stimulated by permitting each guild to monopolize for a time the advantages 35 6 THE DIAL
April 5	DATE	of any processes which it may introduce ; and every - where the artist will be crowned as the most de - serving of men .

		It is a pleasant Utopia , but not to be had for the asking .

		Indeed , if one may now add a , word of criticism , the impression left by the book is one of oversim - plicity and unreality ; it has about it an air of jejune and ideologic youth .

		It has all of
Kropotkin	PERSON	's gentleness and many of his delusions ; but it has little of
Kropotkin	PERSON	's patient grappling with difficult details .

		It has beauty , such as one has come to ex - pect of
Bertrand Russell	PERSON	; but it is a fragile beauty : a sentence or two from
Nietzsche	LOCATION	, one fears , would smash it into sweet regrets .

		There is here no con - sideration of the powerful competitive impulses of men , their love of inequality and difference , their lust for domination ; one would think that '' natural selection '' and '' the will to power '' had been quite annihilated by '' mutual aid . '' '

		One looks , in such a discussion , for some resolute consideration of what are the forces , psychological and economic , that make against , as well as those that make for , our social ends ; what the relative strength of these forces is ; and how intelligence may bend them into some progressive synthesis .

		Indeed , these '' roads to freedom '' are not roads at all , but goals and thought must find the way .

		To find fault after this fashion is no pleasant task , and a paragraph of it will do .

		These deduc - tions made , the book still retains exceptional worth : it is refreshingly simple and kindly ; here at last our various economic isms meet without fratricidal strife ; here is an honest estimate of them by a man who has loved and loves them all . ''

		Meantime , '' says the author , ending in a flash of poetry that dis - arms and almost nullifies all criticism , '' the world in which we exist has other aims .

		But it will pass away , burnt up in the fire of its own hot passions ; and from its ashes will spring a new and younger world , full of fresh hope , with the light of mornang in its eyes . ''

		Wfren that new world comes men will not forget to honor
Bertrand Russell	PERSON	.

		WILL DURANT .

		et Praeterea ?

		i r WILL BE RECALLED that when the Imagists first came upon us they carried banners , and that upon one of them was inscribed their detestation of the `` cosmic , '' and of the `` cosmic '' poet , who -LRB- they added -RRB- '' seems to us to shirk the real difficulties of his art . ''

		No doubt if the Imagists were to issue this particular volume again they would find occa - sion to alter this and perhaps other statements , for here as elsewhere they sinned against one of their own cardinal doctrines they failed to think clearly and , ipso facto , failed also to define with precision .

		Were they quite sure what they meant by the term `` cosmic '' poet ?

		Did they mean , for example , Dante or only
Ella Wheeler Wilcox	PERSON	?

		The point is trifling , it may be , and yet it is not without its interest , for - it indicates an error characteristic of the moment .

		It was not unnatural that those of our poetic revolutionaries who , tired of the verbose sentimentalities and ineptitudes of the more medi - ocre among their predecessors , determined to achieve a sharper picturism in poetry should in the first ex - cited survey of the situation decide that anything '' cosmic , '' or let us say philosophic , was obviously beyond the focus of their poetic camera could not be '' picturized . ''

		It appeared that thought would have to be excluded and in fact for a year or more , under the influence of the Imagists , the markets were flooded with a free verse in which thought was conspicuously at a minimum .

		`` Pure sensa - tion ! ''

		was the cry a cry which has been heard be - fore , and will be heard again ; it arises from a ques - tion almost as old as poetry itself the question whether the poet should be only a drifting senso - rium , and merely feel , or whether he should be per - mitted to think .

		Should he be a voice , simply or something beside ?

		Should he occasionally , to - put it colloquially , say something ?

		Or should he be merely a magic lantern , casting colored pictures forever on a screen ?

		The question is put perhaps too starkly , and pur - posely leaves out of account all of the minute grada - tions by which one passes from the one extreme to the other .

		And the occasion for the question is Mr.
Maxwell Bodenheim	PERSON	, who , though already well known as a poet , has just published his first book ,
Minna	PERSON	and Myself -LRB- Pagan ;
$ 1.25	MONEY	-RRB- .

		Mr.
Boden	PERSON	- heim might well , it appears , have been one of the Imagists .

		None of them , with perhaps the excep - tion of ''
H. D.	PERSON	, '' can equal his delicate precision of phrasing .

		None of them is more subtly pictorial .

		Moreover Mr.
Bodenheim	PERSON	's theories as to the nature of poetry -LRB- for which he has adroitly argued -RRB- , such as that it should be a '' colored grace '' and that it should bear no relation to '' human beliefs and fundamental human feelings , '' might seem even more clearly to define that affinity .

		Yet it would be a great mistake to ticket Mr.
Bodenheim	PERSON	as an Imagist merely because his poetry is sharply pic - torial , or because he has declared that poetry should not deal with fundamental human emotions .

		As a THE DIAL 357 matter of fact his theory and performance are two very different things .

		One has not gone very far before detecting in him a curious dualism of per - sonality .

		It is obvious , of course , that Mr.
Bodenheim	PERSON	has taken out of the air much that the Imagists and other radicals have set in circulation .

		His poe.ms are in the freest of free verse : they are indeed quite candidly without rhyme or metrical rhythm , and re - solve themselves for the most part into series of lucid and delicate statements , of which the crisp cadences are only perhaps the cadences of a very sensitive prose .

		It is to Mr.
Bodenheim	PERSON	's credit that despite the heavy handicap of such a form he makes poems .

		How does he do this ?

		Not merely by evoking sharp - edged images if he did only that he would be in - deed simply an exponent of '' colored grace '' or Imagism but precisely because his exquisite pic - tures are not merely pictures , but symbols .

		And the things they symbolize are , oddly enough , these flouted '' fundamental feelings . ''

		Mr.
Bodenheim	PERSON	is , in short , a symbolist .

		His poems are almost invariably presentations of mood , evanescent and tenuous tenuous , frequently , to the point of impalpability in terms of the visual or tactile ; and if it would be an exaggeration to say that they differ from the purely imagistic type of poetry by being , for this reason , essentially emo - tional , nevertheless such a statement approximates the truth .

		Perhaps rather one should say that they are the ghosts of emotions , or the perfumes of them .

		It is at this point that one guesses Mr.
Bodenheim	PERSON	's dualism .

		For it seems as if the poet were at odds with the theorist : as if the poet desired to betray these `` fundamental emotions '' to a greater extent than the severe theorist will permit .

		In conse - quence one feels that Mr.
Bodenheim	PERSON	has cheated not only his reader but also himself .

		He gives us enough to show us that he is one of the most original of contemporary poets , but one feels that out of sheer perversity he has withheld even more than he has given .

		There are many poets who have the vox et praeterea nihil of poetry , and who wisely therefore cultivate that kind of charm ; but it is a tragedy when a poet such as Mr.
Bodenheim	PERSON	, pos - sessing other riches as well , ignores these riches in credulous obeisance to the theory that , since it is the voice , the hover , the overtone , the perfume alone which is important in poetry , therefore poetry is to be sought rather in the gossamer than in the rock .

		Mr.
Bodenheim	PERSON	has taken the first step : he has found that moods can be magically described no less than dew and roses .

		But poetic magic , as
George Santayana	PERSON	has said , is chiefly a matter of perspective it is the revelation of '' sweep in the concise and depth in the clear '' and , as
Santayana	PERSON	points out , if this is true we need not be surprised to perceive that the poet will find greatest scope for this faculty in dealing with ideas , particularly with philosophic ideas ... And we return to our old friend the '' cosmic . ''

		Nor need Mr.
Bodenheim	PERSON	be unduly alarmed .

		For when one suggests that the contemplation of life as a whole , or the recognition of its items as merely minute sand-grains of that whole , or an occa - sional recollection of man 's twinkling unimportance , or a fleeting glimpse of the cruel perfection of the order of things are among the finest headlands from which the poet may seek an outlook , one is certainly not suggesting that poets should be I6gicians .

		It is not the paraphernalia but the vision of philosophy which is sublime .

		If the poet 's business is vision , he can ill afford to ignore this watch-tower .

		For if , like Mr.
Bodenheim	PERSON	, he desires that poetry shall be a kind of absolute music , '' unattached with sur - face sentiment '' a music in which sensations are the notes , emotions the harmonies , and ideas the counterpoint ; a music of detached waver and gleam , which , taking for granted a complete knowledge of all things , will npt be so naive as to make state - ments , or argue a point , or praise the nature of things , or inveigh against it , but will simply employ all such elements as the keys to certain tones then truly the keyboard of the poet who uses his brain as well as his sensorium will be immensely greater than that , let us say , of the ideal Imagist .

		The point has been elaborated because , as has been said , it is one on which Mr.
Bodenheim	PERSON	seems to be at odds with himself : the poems in
Minna	LOCATION	and Myself show him to be an adept at playing with moods , an intrepid juggler with sensations , but one who tends to repeat his tricks , and to juggle always with the same set of balls .

		Of the poems them - selves what more needs to be said than that they are among the most delicately tinted and fantastically subtle of contemporary poems in free verse ?

		Mr.
Bodenheim	PERSON	's sensibility is as unique in its way as that of
Wallace Stevens	PERSON	or of
T. S. Eliot	PERSON	or of
Alfred Kreymborg	PERSON	.

		One need not search here for the robust , nor for the seductively rhythmic , nor for the enkindling .

		^ Mr.
Bodenheim	PERSON	's patterns are cool almost to the point of preciosity ; they are , so to speak , only one degree more fused than mosaics .

		They must be read with sympathy or not at all .

		And one feels that Mr.
Bodenheim	PERSON	is only at his beginning , and that he will eventually free himself of his conventions on the score of rhythm -LRB- with which he is experimenting tentatively -RRB- and of theme-color .

		In what direction _ these broadenings will lead him , only Mr.
Bodenheim	PERSON	can discover .

		One is convinced , however , that he can step out with security .

		358 THE DIAL
April 5 Dublin	DATE	,
March 6 1	DATE	HE RECORDS OF THE IRISH Literary '' Move - ment '' will be scanned in vain for any reference to Mr.
Forrest Reid	PERSON	, who has just published A Gar - den by the Sea : Stories and Sketches -LRB-
Talbot Press	ORGANIZATION	;
Dublin	LOCATION	-RRB- his first book to appear with an Irish imprint .

		Indeed , there must be many who have read his remarkable novels of Ulster character , The Bracknels , Following Darkness , - and At the Door of the
Gate	LOCATION	, without knowing that the author is an Irishman , living in
Belfast	LOCATION	.

		Although Mr.
Reid	PERSON	was a contributor to
Uladh	LOCATION	, the quarterly jour - nal of the Ulster Literary Theater in its heroic period , he has never associated himself with any of the groups in
Ireland	LOCATION	whose regionalism has given them prominence .

		In fact , so determined is he to escape the stigma which he conceives attaching to that word , '' that he surpassed himself by writing an excellent study of
W. B. Yeats	PERSON	from which all reference to the literary renascence in
Ireland	LOCATION	is omitted .

		Mr.
Forrest Reid	PERSON	is , therefore , a further instance of that diversity which , .

		as I mentioned in my last letter , distinguishes
Belfast	LOCATION	from
Dublin	LOCATION	.

		One is constantly surprised to discover , isolated here and there in that brazenly provincial town , a num - ber of talented writers who crave neither the sup - port nor the society of their more widely advertised colleagues '' south of the
Boyne	LOCATION	. ''

		Where the South is gregarious , the North is unsociable , and literature is a vice one cultivates unknown to one 's friends .

		How unlike the intellectual communism of the
Dublin	LOCATION	literati , whose existence excites the half contemptuous wonder of British explorers !

		It is difficult to obtain the works of Mr.
Reid	PERSON	in the bookshops of his native city , and as for the pub - lications of the '' mere Irish , '' they are procurable only '' to order '' that exasperating formula .

		One can only hope that the Irish imprint will not alto - gether ruin the author 's credit with the suspicious vendors of British best-sellers in
Belfast	LOCATION	.

		The superstitious fear of these gentlemen lest their shelves be contaminated with
Sinn Fein	ORGANIZATION	literature has even less justification in this case than in that of the majority of the writers thus boycotted , for there is not the faintest trace of the national self-con - sciousness which is so terrifying to the Carsonian imagination .

		Mr.
Forrest Reid	PERSON	is , I believe , the only articulate Irishman who has no feeling for poli - tics , and no interest in any party to the Anglo-Irish struggle .

		There is an authentic record of the fact incredible to us that he was in
Larne	LOCATION	when Sir
Edward Carson	PERSON	's rebels landed their arms in
1914	DATE	, but retired to sleep in utter oblivion to the seemingly meaningless commotion , although the loyal insurrec - tionaries had overpowered the authorities and taken possession of the town .

		The gun-runners of
Larne	LOCATION	, and those who emulated them at such cost in Dub - lin later , will scrutinize the pages of A Garden by the Sea in vain for heresies or propaganda .

		Mr.
Reid	PERSON	has no passion but that of the writer for his craft .

		He gives to literature what others have de - voted to ward politics and geographical patriotism .

		Even the two camps into which his admirers have divided will have to agree as to the merits of this book , for each will find the necessary material to prove that the author is a romantic or a realist .

		Courage , The Truant , and the title-story are perfect examples of that fanciful , imaginative style which , while never wholly absent from the work of Mr.
Reid	PERSON	, predominates so far in certain cases as to mark off his stories into the two classes referred to .

		On the other hand , his realistic manner is well illus - trated in The Reconciliation , The Accomplice , and An Ulster Farm to mention the more important stories .

		If this selection had been made for the special purpose of shaking the assurance of the author 's critics , it could not have been better devised to that end .

		While it is easy to assert if one incline that way that The Bracknels and At the Door of the Gate are better than
The Spring Song	ORGANIZATION	and The Gentle Lover , the choice is by no means so simple between , say , A Garden by the Sea and An Ulster Farm .

		On the whole , an admirer of the realist must confess that the romanticist has triumphed in the present volume .

		Every story is carefully and beau - tifully written , with the ease and deftness of a prac - ticed artist , but of necessity the realist is more de - pendent upon his material for his effects , and as it happens , the substance of the realistic sketches is slight .

		At this point precisely , the artistry of the writer triumphs where the themes are such as must rely entirely upon craftsmanship for their success .

		Such sketches as An Ending , with its evocation of dying
Bruges	LOCATION	, or A Garden by the Sea , with its reveries over childhood with what should they hold the reader but the suggestive , brooding har - mony of style and mood ?

		The incident narrated de - rives in each case its sole interest from the author 's power of investing the subject with the glamour of the moment in which his imagination was stirred .

		It is just the faculty of conveying the impalpable suggestion of a singularly sensitive imagination which constitutes the beauty of this writing .

		When , as in Following Darkness , Mr.
Forrest Reid	PERSON	1919 THE DIAL 359 has a theme which calls for the employment of all his arts , then he gives us what we must so far re - gard as his masterpiece .

		None of the qualities which distinguish the author 's contribution to contem - porary literature is absent from this miniature of his work , and he has emancipated himself from the de - rivative influences which threatened at one time to mar the eerie effect of such a conception as The Truant , now presented in an original and truly characteristic manner , without Machenesque accre - tions .

		The latest addition to the greatly prized series of books issued by
Miss E. C. Yeats	PERSON	at the
Cuala Press	ORGANIZATION	is the Kiltartan Poetry Book , by Lady
Gregory	PERSON	.

		It is a collection of folksongs translated from the Irish , and reprinted , for the most part , from
Cuchulain	PERSON	of Muirthemne , Gods and Fighting Men , Saints and Wonders , and Poets and Dreamers .

		The volume is a reminder of the changes which have taken place since the works in question first appeared .

		The most recent is twelve years old , and all of them pre - ceded the world fame which Synge brought to the peasant idiom , in which he and
Lady Gregory	LOCATION	, fol - lowing Dr.
Douglas Hyde	PERSON	, created a new literary convention .

		Not the least of time 's effects has been to produce in
Ireland	LOCATION	a reaction in certain quarters against the Gaelicized English which these writers employed .

		We have developed a tendency to speak disparagingly of Kiltartanese , and if
Synge	PERSON	's estab - lished glory protects him from the carping of the disaffected , the living exponents of the style have to bear the brunt of hostile criticism .

		Two influences have been at work undermining the prestige of
Kil	ORGANIZATION	- tartan speech .

		To take the lesser first : there have arisen new idols worshipped , at least , in the circles most loudly anti-Kiltartan and they are credited with an exactness of knowledge of the peasant and his idiom beside which
Synge	PERSON	is classed as mere literature .

		It is solemnly argued that no peasant actually talks like The Playboy of the Western World as if
Synge	PERSON	had ever undertaken to compile a species of
Congressional Record	ORGANIZATION	of the
Aran Islands	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is , of course , no virtue in phono - graphic records of unilluminating talk , whether of peasants or politicians .

		When we have analyzed the technique of Synge , we have by no means disposed of his art .

		The writer of genius must know how to transform and transcend reality , so that we lose sight of his convention in the profound beauty of his ultimate effects .

		At this point arises the second , and more serious , influence in the process of discredit which has threat - ened the literary use of Anglo-Irish idiom .

		Like so many other conventions , it has been overworked , and we are suffering from a prolonged acquaintance with the mere mechanism of the style , divorced from real beauty of thought or form .

		For the one occa - sion when the public has an opportunity of admiring the highest expression of Kiltartan speech , there are dozens when only its cheapest manifestations are available notably in the later comedies and melo - dramas of the popular peasant playwrights .

		These have become almost as dull and unbearable as the jargon of the old-fashioned stage Irishman .

		In fact we are tiring of a new-fashioned stage Irishman , for precisely the same reason as we wearied of his prede - cessor .

		Both fail to correspond to anything in our experience , and both fail to stimulate the imagina - tion .

		If the '' folk speech '' of our present day literature is not quite so horrible as the abominable dialect of the earlier writers , it is because it is saved by its genuine relation to a cultivated and subtle tongue .

		But this Gaelicized English can not survive apart from the work it clothes , any more than the lesser Elizabethans could hope to dispute the final supremacy of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		Purely verbal substi - tutes for style and matter can not deceive , and it is the most short-sighted reaction which prompts this condemnation of the language of The Playboy , be - cause every imitator is not a Synge .

		Those who read Mr.
Dermot O'Byrne	PERSON	's Children of the
Hills	ORGANIZATION	, when it was published by Messrs.
Maunsel	PERSON	some years ago , will readily understand that his new book of short stories , entitled Wrack -LRB-
Talbot Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , has aroused the Kiltartan contro - versy in many places .

		Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	once threatened to publish no more short stories because of the incorrigible belief of all reviewers that only Maupassant could write short stories .

		The super - stition that only
Synge	PERSON	could use the peasant idiom of Anglo-Irish is a somewhat similar bogey , with which Mr.
O'Byrne	PERSON	is threatened , but fortunately he has not been afraid to offer the public a second collection of those fine tales , whose imagination , poetry , and dialectical vigor showed that he had mastered for prose narrative the medium of Synge , the dramatist .

		These six stories illustrate most admirably the author 's wide range of imagination , from modern realism to historical reconstruction , and including visionary phantasy .

		Mr.
O'Byrne	PERSON	's method is au - thentic ; his knowledge of Irish , combined with an intimate contact with the scenes and people he de - scribes , gives to his work the color and raciness which can not be captured by the mechanical
Kiltar	PERSON	- tanizers .

		His stories are so obvious a demonstration of the absurdity of the theory that Anglo-Irish is the speech of mere comedy , their power is so challenging in its defiant idiomatic technique , that adverse crit - icism has taken refuge in the old trench of patriotic puritanism from which
Synge	PERSON	was bombarded .

		Mr. 3 6
THE DIAL April 5 O'Byrne	ORGANIZATION	is accused of calumniating the Gael and this in spite of the fact that a recent book of his verse , A Ballad of
Dublin	LOCATION	-LRB- Candle Press -RRB- , which was suppressed by the Censor , has been described by
W. B. Yeats	PERSON	as containing the best poem in - spired by the Rising of Easter Week
1916	DATE	.

		Another victim of that functionary is the pseudonymous ''
D. L. Kay	PERSON	, '' whose Glamour of
Dublin	LOCATION	-LRB-
Talbot Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has attracted the great - est attention , as the most original of the innumer - able books to which this city has supplied a theme .

		It is a collection of - impressionistic sketches , some actual , others historical , many fantastical .

		The first chapter , which purports to give the impressions of
Parnell	ORGANIZATION	during Easter Week , as he watched the Sinn Fein stronghold in O'Connell Street from his pedestal at the top of that thoroughfare , was the occasion of the Censor 's interference .

		The closing paragraph was blue-penciled because of the sugges - tion that
Padraic Pearse	PERSON	was not ejected from the portal of heaven , but was greeted with '' Pass , friend '' as he entered the '' seraphic gates , wherever , east of the moon , the jasper hinges turn . ''

		As the missing paragraph was printed in an English period - ical , with appropriate comment , it will doubtless be discreet to quote these words from it .

		In an - other chapter the words '' even now '' were deleted from a reference to the grave of Wolfe Tone , '' where he lies , dreaming , even now , of Irish free - dom . ''

		The book however does not depend upon these extraneous humors of British government in
Ireland	LOCATION	for its interest .

		It is a unique series of '' promenades of an impressionist , '' who has a de - lightful gift of irony and an amazing fund of pre - cise topographical lore at his disposal , both of which are so adroitly insinuated that the reader discovers , only when he has ceased chuckling , that he has been given an extraordinary glimpse of the sub - tleties of our peculiar history .

		The description of Queen
Victoria	PERSON	and her husband scrawling their names in ink upon an illuminated page of the price - less Book of
Kells	PERSON	, is a masterpiece , which has been duly appreciated .

		Out of the purest altruism one hopes that The Glamour of
Dublin	LOCATION	will not be missed by English readers who , it appears , are looking coldly upon Irish and Russian literature because of the political heterodoxy of these two countries .

		So , in literature as in politics , our hope lies with
America	LOCATION	.

CLARENCE BRITTEN	PERSON	In Charge of the Reconstruction Program .

		THORSTEIN
VEBLEN HAROLD STEARNS HELEN MAROT	PERSON	Jt5 OLSHEVISM IS A MENACE TO THE VESTED INTER - ests of privilege and property .

		This is the golden text which illuminates the policies pursued by the statesmen of the
Great Powers	ORGANIZATION	in all their dealings with
Soviet Russia	LOCATION	.

		Not that this axiom of im - perialist statecraft is formally written into the Cove - nant of the League .

		It is only that the policies pursued by the Elder Statesmen of the
Great Powers	ORGANIZATION	have impeccably followed its line .

		What is formally written into the documents is the broad principle of self-determination .

		But in the measures taken by the Elder Statesmen , unasked , for the reg - ularization of Soviet
Russia	LOCATION	there enters no shadow of regard for the principle of self-determination .

		All of which appears quite reasonable and regular so soon as it is illuminated by this golden text of the Elder Statesmen , that Bolshevism is a menace to the vested interests of privilege and property .

		The high merit as well as the high necessity o the resulting maneuvers of repression may be taken for granted as a matter of course .

		No question of the merit of these maneuvers is admitted either by the substantial citizens or by their safe and sane states - men .

		But it may still be in order to entertain a question as to what measures had best be taken in these premises , considering the means in hand and the circumstances of the case , considering the diffi - culties of any effectual intervention and the uneasy temper of the underlying peoples with which these
Elder Statesmen	ORGANIZATION	will have to make up their account .

		The Russian situation is by no means simple and its details are sufficiently obscure .

		Yet the outlines of it are visible in a large way , and '' it is not without a certain consistency .

		And it is a perplexing sit - uation that faces the Elder Statesmen of the
Great Powers	ORGANIZATION	.

		By and large
Soviet Russia	LOCATION	is self-support - ing , beyond any other considerable body of popula - tion in
Europe	LOCATION	, and it is correspondingly difficult to regulate by forcible measures from outside .

		The Russian people at large are still in a '' backward state '' industrially .

		So that they are used to de - pending on a home-grown food supply and on local and household industry for the ordinary necessities of life in the way of clothing , shelter , fuel , and transport ^ At the same time they also have the use of something appreciable in the way of a machine industry , widely scattered both along their borders and through the country inland enough to serve somewhat sparingly as a sufficient auxiliary to their farm and household industry in case of urgent need .

		It follows that any protracted continuation of the existing blockade of imports will scarcely starve
Soviet Russia	LOCATION	into submission .

		In fact it could scarcely do more than starve the remnants of the vested interests in
Russia	LOCATION	.

		This would hold true even in the improbable event that the Great Powers should succeed in closing the ports of the
Pacific	LOCATION	,
Baltic	LOCATION	, and Black Sea to all sea-borne trade .

		To hold such a country in a perpetual stage of siege would scarcely be a profitable enterprise , since there is no prospect of a favorable outcome , and since a perpetuation of this state of siege would bring no gain to the vested interests in whose behalf the en - terprise is undertaken .

		At the same time an exten - sive campaign of occupation and forcible control promises no better solution , inasmuch as the
Soviet Republic	LOCATION	is proving to be quite formidable in the field , and since the amorphous country on which it draws is not vulnerable in any vital part .

		It has the defects of its qualities , but it has also the quali - ties of its defects .

		It is incapable of serious aggres - - sion , but it is also incapable of conclusive defeat by force .

		Meantime Soviet
Russia	LOCATION	offers an attractive mar - ket for such American products as machine tools and factory equipment , railway material and roll - ing stock , electrical supplies , farm implements and tools , textiles , wrought leather goods , certain food - stuffs and certain metals ; and at the same time there is waiting a large volume of export trade , including such things as grain and other foodstuffs , flax , hemp , and lumber .

		Should the blockade be main - tained for any time it is not to be doubted that the illicit trade into
Soviet Russia	LOCATION	in all these things will rise to unexampled proportions to the very substantial profit of the Scandinavians and other expert smugglers and blockade runners .

		Meantime , too , the
Great Powers	ORGANIZATION	whose national integrity has now been provisionally stabilized by
America	LOCATION	's de - cisive participation in the war are placing an em - bargo on the import of many articles into the
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean market in practical effect an embargo on the importation of these American products for which Soviet
Russia	LOCATION	is now making a cash offer .

		Soviet
Russia	LOCATION	is today the only country that places no ob - stacles in the way of import trade .

		So it becomes an interesting question : How long will those Amer - ican vested interests which derive an income from 362 THE DIAL
April 5	DATE	foreign trade have the patience to forego an assured profit from open trade with
Soviet Russia	LOCATION	in order to afford certain European vested interests a dubi - ously problematical chance to continue getting some - thing for nothing in the way of class privilege and unearned income ?

		` URING THE WAR THE FABLE OF THE SYBILLINE books was frequently quoted , always with reference to the diminishing opportunity afforded the
Central Powers	ORGANIZATION	for a peace of repentance and pardon .

		It is the irony of history that the fable has acquired a new application this time to the victorious powers themselves .

		It is to them that the fateful figure ap - pears offering her books of prophecy , nine , six , three .

		And the question with each diminished opportunity is more insistent .

		On
January 25	DATE	, THE DIAL said : '' The fundamental necessity for a better world is a sacrifice of the instinct for possession ... If predatory instincts , sway the Conference to concern itself chiefly with demands for territory , indemnity , and commercial privilege on the part of the victors then indeed the rulers of the world will have proved once more their unfitness , and this time the people can not be deceived . ''

		The events of the past two months seem to have justified the second part of this prophecy .

		Unquestionably predatory instincts have governed the
Conference	ORGANIZATION	.

		The talk which has emanated from
Paris	LOCATION	has been of how much Ger - many can pay , of shutting her off from raw ma - terials , of granting the
Saar Valley	ORGANIZATION	and the left bank of the Rhine to
France	LOCATION	,
Danzig	PERSON	to
Poland	LOCATION	, and of extending the Italian frontier to the
Bren	PERSON	- ner .

		Even the
Covenant of the League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	, which should have been a means of reconciliation , was presented in the guise of an alliance of the vic - torious nations , and the generous interpretation which should have relieved it of this character has not been forthcoming .

		And the inevitable has hap - pened .


Hungary	LOCATION	, frightened by an unwarrantable extension of the terms of the Armistice , and threat - ened with dismemberment , has followed the ex - ample of
France	LOCATION	in
1792	DATE	, has committed her na - tional existence directly to her people .

		Whether the social solvent of the Soviet form of government will suffice to hold in solution the various races with nationalistic ambitions which
Hungary	LOCATION	includes is not yet certain .

		But in any case the moving finger has written another syllable of the mene , mene , tekel , upharsin on the walls within which Belshazzar keeps his feast at
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Upon President
Wilson	PERSON	, as upon no other of the Allied statesmen , the re - sponsibility rests .

		It is fair to say that all the ques - tions which have delayed peace and made
Paris	LOCATION	a Babel of discord were settled in principle by the statement of war aims which he gave to his allies and to his enemies .

		They were accepted by the former with full acquiescence , in spite of his invita - tion to them to discuss or dissent .

		Thev were understood by the latter and thus became a part of that political , or rather moral , offensive which con - tributed to their undoing .

		Above all they were ad - dressed to his fellow countrymen as the interpreta - tion of the cause for which they were fighting .

		To all allies , enemies , and fellow-citizens President
Wilson	PERSON	assumed obligations of the most solemn kind , involving not only his own personal honor but the honor of his country .

		He knows this , as he knows the result if he fail .

		The fateful words of his
Boston	LOCATION	speech were spoken in solemn remem - brance of the power which he has invoked : '' They -LSB- the people -RSB- are in the saddle , and they are going to see to it : that if the present governments do not do their will , some other governments shall . ''

		A SINISTER NOTE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF
THE Conference	ORGANIZATION	is the fact that the four leading partners have taken frankly to the practice of secret negotia - tion , and it is significant that this is coincident with the revolution in
Hungary	LOCATION	.

		They are confronted by a second people choosing the path of immediate self-determination , and their decision what course to take is apparently not to be an '' open covenant openly arrived at . ''

		But this case differs from the Russian situation in that the secrecy can not long be maintained , and the action of the representatives at
Paris	LOCATION	will be subject to quick consideration and re - vision by the people whom they represent .

		Should the conferees undertake the forcible suppression of Soviet and other efforts at self-determination there will be war , unorganized war as well as organized .

		In such war the bitter-enders will fight .

		If a reign of terror overwhelms
Europe	LOCATION	the responsibility will fall on the
Supreme Council	ORGANIZATION	for its failure to recog - nize that the real forces of reorganization are to be found within the movements of the people .

		These movements are not comparable , as the Councilors seem to believe , to a general strike in one or more in - dustries .

		The colossal proportions of the movement as a whole have to do not only with its extent but with its character .

		It is a movement in which people know what they want and , as they are op - posed , will arm and fight to get it .

		Military repression of this particular kind of want intensifies the desire for it and induces the support of those who were neutral .

		Blockades become boomerangs , since hunger and deprivation feed such movements .

		The present movement in
Central Europe	LOCATION	and
Great Britain	LOCATION	is an indication of an international con - sciousness of common interest .

		Before the people have had time to recover themselves from the ex - haustions of war - they are faced with the startling fact that the self-determination for which they fought has not been won ; that neitherthe Peace Conference nor
the Supreme Council	ORGANIZATION	has given a sign of granting it .

		When the statesmen who rep - resented the old order directed their appeal to the people in terms of altruistic patriotism they little
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 3 6 3 guessed the forces with which they were conjuring .

		The people answered the appeal to arms and fought for a different kind of world , a world in which democracy was to be lived for rather than died for .

		This current which is rising with uncontrollable power is free of old diplomacy and political domi - nation ; to dam it means world catastrophe .

		What it needs is time ; a chance to harness and generate power more potent in human welfare than devices of statecraft hatched in the capitals of the old world , which is passing .

		SABOTAGE is ONE OF THE LATE AND FORMID - able loan-words of the English language .

		At the same time it has also some currency in other lan - guages , as would be expected in the case of a loan - word which fills so notable a place in common speech , since the facts which call for the use of such a new word are sure to range beyond the frontiers of any one language .

		In all this the word has the company of such other late comers as '' camouflage '' and '' bolshevism . ''

		And not much different is the case of such late-come , home-bred terms as '' graft '' and '' goodwill , '' and `` intangible assets '' and '' vested interests . ''

		Whether they are borrowed from abroad or are made over from innocent home-grown words , all these half - technical terms that are making their way into common use to describe notable facts lack that sharp definition that belongs to words of the ancient line .

		There is always something of metaphor or analogy about them , and the meaning attached to their use in common speech is neither precise nor uniform .

		They are still more or less unfamiliar ; they seem uncouth and alien , but they make good their intrusion into the language by becoming indispensable .

		They are needed for present use to describe facts which are very much in evidence and which are not otherwise provided for .

		Of course , the facts described by such late word - growths as '' graft , '' '' sabotage , '' '' camouflage , '' or '' bolshevism '' are not altogether new , nor nearly so ; but they count for more now than they have done in the past , and so it has become necessary to find words for them .

		As a fact of history , graft is at least as old as the early Egyptian dynasties , and sabotage is quite inseparable from the price sys - tem , so that its beginnings can scarcely fail to be as ancient as the love of money .

		It is perhaps the first-born of those evils that have been said to be rooted in the love of money .

		Doubtless graft and sabotage have been running along together through human history from its beginning .

		We should all find it very difficult to get our bearings in any period of history or any state of society which might by any chance not be shot through with both .

		Still those ancients who passed before the
last quarter of the nineteenth century	DATE	had not the use of these technical terms to describe the facts , with which they seem all the while to have been familiar enough .

		It may have been because the facts of graft and sabotage , however massive and wide - reaching they doubtless were in those past times , did not , after all , then stand out in such bold relief on the face of things .

		But things have moved forward since then .

		And quite plainly now , since the price system and all its ways , means , #nd ends have reached that mature development which is familiar to this generation , both of these terms have become indispensable in common and current speech .

		IN CONGRESS - .

		THE PRACTICE OF SABOTAGE HAS long enjoyed another imported and figurative name , also drawn from footgear '' filibuster , '' the onoma - topoetic equivalent of '' freebooter . ''

		Respectable as familiarity has made this political device , it is by in - tent and effect sheer sabotage .

		Witness the pres - ent plight of the
Railroad Administration	ORGANIZATION	and other bureaus , deprived of their necessary and in most cases unopposed appropriations because the late
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, in order to force an extra session in which to protect its constitutional function in foreign af - fairs , deliberately refused to perform its domestic functions and adjourned without providing funds to keep the governmental machine running during its absence .

		With a touching solicitude the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	- men provided for the salaries of their secretaries , but they made no provision for their wage-workers in the lobbies of the two chambers .

		And while they take the
spring	DATE	air in cities whose street-cleaning de - partments do not depend upon federal appropria - tion , the government clerks they have left behind in
Washington	LOCATION	walk to work that is , in many cases , temporarily unpaid , through streets that are un - swept because
Congress	ORGANIZATION	went on strike .

		Nobody believes , of course , that the governmental machine will stop for lack of the withheld fuel ; and in most departments the results of the Congressional strike will be more ludicrous than .

		important .

		One bureau however has been throttled in its hour of utmost need .

		The
Federal Employment Service	ORGANIZATION	suddenly finds itself with funds to operate less than sixty of its seven hundred placement agencies , and must ap - peal , to states and municipalities to keep open as many of these offices as possible .

		Its personnel , re - cently assembled at great pains , is again scattered , and its training school closed .

		Meanwhile demobil - ization continues and unemployment mounts .

		At best we have taken too little interest in finding jobs for our war workers and returned soldiers .

		And congressional tactics that slow down our all too in - adequate machinery for returning these hands to productive industry is really no matter at whom it is directed nor how it is dignified in parliamentary parlance straight sabotage on business , on labor , an.d on the people at large , the form of sabotage known as striking on the job .

		THE
DIAL April 5 Communications	ORGANIZATION	To THE SECRETARY OF WAR MY DEAR
MR. BAKER	PERSON	: I enclose a clipping from a report of the discharge of 113 military prisoners from
Fort Leavenworth	LOCATION	.

		A well-known woman , a publicist of note , and , I may add , a member of one of the largest and most progressive churches in this city , has just returned from there , where she talked with a number of the prisoners .

		She reports that the city is one of the vilest in the country .

		That conditions in the prison are vile goes without say - ing .

		Fine , idealistic , clean young men are forced to see before their eyes at all hours of the day the most revolting phases of sodomy ; are forced to live in filth ; to say nothing of being subjected to the autocratic and brutal activities of men who are not worthy to black their shoes , but who , by virtue of military authority vested in them , can '' go the limit '' in the endeavor to break the men 's spirits !

		A young man recently discharged from
Fort Leavenworth	LOCATION	, speaking to a group recently -LRB- with no bitterness of spirit , no exaggeration , but with an almost unbelievable restraint -RRB- , said that when the military authorities had broken a man 's spirit they felt that they had done their duty .

		That was success as they saw it ; but think of what it means to the individual , and think of the loss to the man - hood of the nation !

		The man who will suffer for conscience 's sake is , as President
Wilson	PERSON	said , of unusual spiritual fiber or intellectual independence .

		And what have we done to hundreds of such men ?

		Some have died ; others will never recover physically from the treatment that has been meted out to them and our government stands before the world , responsible for these crimes !

		Is it not time that we , as well as
Russia	LOCATION	, recog - nized the worth of human beings in general , and acknowledged the particular worth of these splendid young men who are standing for liberty of con - science for the democracy that our Constitution outlines , but which our authorities disregard in the most barefaced manner imaginable ?

		The machinery of release of these political pris - oners -LRB- to recognize whom , officially , would be to deny the democratic ideals that we have got so far away from -RRB- has been some time starting .

		However can it not be speeded up ?

		A large audience of relatives and friends gath - ered last week to hear two speakers on this subject .

		They want their husbands , and brothers , and sweet - hearts , and friends back , and they should have them ` as soon as is humanly possible !

		A few days ' delay may mean death to some , now nearly broken !

		Two great souls have recently gone physically too frail to stand the treatment ; spiritually too strong to desert their ideals .

		How many more are to go the same way ?

		The people of the country are putting this question up to you .

WATSON	PERSON	.


New York City	LOCATION	,
Jan. 23	DATE	, MY DEAR Miss WATSON : Your letter of
January 23	DATE	has been referred to me .

		The War Department immediately upon having conditions at the
Disciplinary Barracks	ORGANIZATION	called to its attention , instituted an investigation .

		The report of that investigation disclosed the fact that the trouble at
Leavenworth	LOCATION	, which centered entirely about two or three men , was due , not at all to the administration of the prison , but to the regulations which were ill adapted to the unusual type of pris - oner that the Selective Service Act brought to mili - tary prisons .

		The Secretary at once made some appropriate modifications of those regulations and has called a conference to consider further changes in disciplinary regulations , not only to meet this unusual condition but to bring the
Army	ORGANIZATION	's disciplin - ary methods up to the most modern penological standards , in case they shall be found to be deficient .

		The conference will also consider ways of meeting the immediate emergency of the overcrowding of disciplinary barracks due to the increased size of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	during the war .

		The conference will come to its conclusions in the near future and you may be assured that action leading out of its con - clusions will be promptly taken .

Washington	LOCATION	,
D. C.	PERSON	,
Jan. 28	DATE	, IQIQ .

		DEAR SIR : The communication received in reply to my letter from the third Assistant Secretary of the
Department	ORGANIZATION	of
Jan. 23	DATE	is , may I say , most un - satisfactory , and it is a perfect example , moreover , of the official inefficiency and stupidity that has char - acterized the activities of the
War Department	ORGANIZATION	during the past two years .

		In the first place it is a '' form '' letter , supposed to reply to all communications , and in reality reply - ing to none .

		In the second place the form is nobody knows how old .

		Note the phrase '' due to the increased size of the army during the war ! ''

		In the third place it wholly ignores the main content of my letter the speedy discharge of all of the so-called political prisoners , whether in Leaven - worth or anywhere else .

		Public sentiment is thoroughly aroused on this subject , and letters such as the one to which I refer above are not going to temper it any .

		The matter is much too serious , and it is one that too deeply concerns the honor of the
United States	LOCATION	government , to permit `` the treatment that the War Department seems inclined to give it .

		The imprisonment of these men and women is in defiance of the law of the land and in complete violation of the spirit of our American democracy .

		The War Department can not , I realize , '' recog - nize '' them without admitting that our boasted democracy no longer exists ; but it can free them , at once , one and all , and permit tardy reparation to atone , insofar as is possible , for outrageous mal - administration , and an official shortsightedness and stupidity that borders on criminality .

		1919 THE DIAL 3 6 5 This , permit me to say , is a personal communica - tion , but it expresses a countrywide demand for justice .

New York City	LOCATION	,
Jan. 30 , 1919	DATE	.

		MY DEAR Miss
WATSON	PERSON	: Your letter of
Jan.	DATE	.

		30 has been referred to me .

		You evidently did not understand the letter which I wrote to you on
January 23	DATE	.

		The increased size of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	during the war still influences the size of the present popu - lation of the
Disciplinary Barracks	ORGANIZATION	, as you will realize upon consideration .

		The only group of the so-called political prisoners who come under the
War Department	ORGANIZATION	is composed of that small per cent of the drafted men professing conscientious objections who have been - court mar - tialed and are serving sentence in Disciplinary Bar - racks .

		Representatives of the Secretary are reviewing all such cases at present and
1 1 3	DATE	of these men have already been discharged on their recommendations .

		However , the
War Department	ORGANIZATION	has decided that it would not feel justified in extending on the basis of conscientious objections the same immediate clem - ency to the men who refused all service for their country that has been extended to those who by error or accident were not given the opportunity for such service .

		F p
KEPPEL	ORGANIZATION	, Third Assistant Secretary .


Washington	LOCATION	, D. C. ,
Feb. 13 , 1919	DATE	.

		SIR : After reading in the
New York Times	ORGANIZATION	of
January 23	DATE	the memorandum of Secretary
Baker	PERSON	concerning the release of some conscientious ob - jectors from
Fort Leavenworth	LOCATION	, one finds himself somewhat perplexed over the policy of the
War Department	ORGANIZATION	in this respect .

		According to this statement the released men comprise two groups .

		The first consists of those men who had been recommended for farm furloughs which they had not received because of delay in the execution of the plan .

		The second is composed of those men whom the ''
Board of Inquiry	ORGANIZATION	now find to be sincere , and who in their judgment would have been recommended for furloughs if they had had the opportunity of being examined by the
Board of Inquiry	ORGANIZATION	before the court-martial proceedings . ''

		But , one asks , what does the
Board of Inquiry	ORGANIZATION	con - sider necessary to establish the sincerity of a con - scientious objector ?

		Surely the steadfastness with which he has clung to his declaration of objections can be but a small part of the test , for every ob - jector in
Fort Leavenworth	LOCATION	was there because he had maintained his position in spite of threats , ridi - cule , court-martial , and even physical torture and only 113 of them were released .

		If the
Board	ORGANIZATION	took cognizance of the reasons given by the men for their refusal to accept military service , what reasons did it consider of sufficient validity to establish the sincerity of the person advancing them ?

		If , as has been done in some cases , the
War Department	ORGANIZATION	is following the definition of the conscientious objector which distinguishes him from a political objector in that his motives are purely religious , it is obvious that only those men whose attitude was based on religious convictions were given a chance to prove their sincerity .

		In that event are all the men who derive their views from political theory to be con - sidered in a later hearing , or are they to be labeled '' insincere '' and left to serve long prison terms because , in the eyes of military law , no man can conscientiously hold political opinions varying from those of the majority ?

		But perhaps it is not a man 's philosophy , or his steadfastness in maintaining a course of action in conformity with his belief , that proves his integrity of purpose and fitness to resume the duties of a citizen .

		Possibly this second group is composed of only those men who were able to answer in the affirmative the hypothetical question : '' If you had been offered a farm furlough before you were court - martialed , would you have accepted ? ''

		But why should willingness to accept a farm furlough be made the criterion for judging which of our polit - ical prisoners should be granted amnesty ?

		Could not a man be '' sincere '' in holding the position that all assistance to war is wrong , even such forms of non-combatant service as farm labor ?

		To be brief , is there anything in this memoran - dum of Mr.
Baker	PERSON	's that can be taken as an indi - cation of a liberal policy on the part of the War Department toward a large group of objectors who have based their opposition to the war on political convictions , and who have , or would have , refused all forms of non-combatant as well as combatant service ?

		How TO DISPOSE OF INTELLECTUALS SIR : I have read the communication from Mr.
E. C. Ross	PERSON	in regard to the intellectuals who are always stirring up trouble .

		There is one point which he left out , and that is the method of gather - ing up and disposing of such persons , taking into con - sideration the fact that this is a democratic country .

		In ancient and barbarous times these people were handled very roughly .

		They were shut up in dun - geons , tortured , and many of them burned alive \ but in our highly civilized and humanely democratic time , this sort of punishment should not be allowed .

		These intellectuals should be rounded up , shipped in cattle cars to some centralized stock yards
Chicago	LOCATION	, for instance and there be allowed to vote on the question as to where the penal farm should be established , the majority to decide .

		They should be given several choices say ,
Montana	LOCATION	,

		3 66 THE DIAL
April 5	DATE	Notes on New Books OLD-DAD .

		By
Eleanor Hallowell Abbot	PERSON	.

		Dutton ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		Victorian damsels in pattens could boast no more impenetrable innocence than the heroine of this story ; but given the most romantic of them , and she in a gold-lined nightmare of an even less , cred - ible swiftness , one might hope in vain for such colossal idiocy .


Daphne Bretton	PERSON	, aged eighteen , is suddenly expelled from a prim little college for '' having a boy in her room at night . ''

		After tell - ing her father of her disgrace , she gasps , '' What is it about boys that makes it so wicked to have them around ? ''

		pitching headlong quite consistently with her role in a dead faint at his feet .

		Then follows a fantastically saccharine kaleidoscope of adventures , punctuated with kisses and revelations , which flash across a vivid landscape in
Florida	LOCATION	.

		And all this time the heroine goes blithely along , trailing clouds of the densest ignorance of every situation about her , adoring and running away from her clever father , wondering at and running away with a dissipated young stranger .

		Fortu - nately she is rescued from this fate , and on page 230 we are given a conversation between her and her eventual consort which brings to mind a famous column in a
Chicago	LOCATION	paper nine consecu - tive remarks are ushered in by the nine interlocu - tory verbs : pawed , shivered , scoffed , worried , stammered , winced , apologized , purred , acqui - esced .

		Seriously , this is the sort of book which , by reason of vague and romantic amorality , is nearer perversion than many a less aspiring volume .

		The book is advertised as '' a sure cure for the blues , '' when the very suggestion that half a dozen such people inhabit the same sphere is depressing in itself .

		HELEN OF TROY AND ROSE .

		By
Phyllis Bottome	PERSON	.

		Century ;
$ 1.35	MONEY	.

		These two studies of women 's temperaments are handled with the delicacy and insight that mark much of
Phyllis Bottome	PERSON	's work .

		With deft , swift touches she suggests atmosphere and situa - tions that other writers might take pages to pre - sent and thus these stories that might each have rilled a volume can be included iji a book rather shorter than an ordinary novel .

		Although they are strongly differentiated in plot and treatment , each of them deals with fundamentally the same theme the matrimonial problems of an English - man .

		One is inclined to stress the point of na - tionality , because the difficulties of the heroine seem to come from traits largely inherent in their na - tionality and training .

		Anyone acquainted with the educational ideal in
England	LOCATION	as it concerns the emotions , or who has read Mr.
Wells	PERSON	' study of education in that country before the war in
Joan	PERSON	and
Peter	PERSON	, must be aware how unfitted by training is the average reserved English girl of the upper classes to cope with the varied phases of passion .

		She is brought up to despise , deny , and suppress her emotions , to taboo romance and sentiment as '' soppiness , '' and to aim , above all things , at self - control .

		Fortunately there are forces at work in human nature that counteract such one-sided train - ing and insist on some sort of self-expression , but the training bears fruit in inhibitions that are diffi - cult to overcome and that lead frequently to mis - adjustment and misunderstanding .

		One of
Phyllis Bottome	PERSON	's heroines marries the typica | , ^ Englishman who fears '' a scene , '' but who needs one to bring him to his senses ; while the other marries the typical Frenchman who would rather enjoy one .

		Each story shows the suffering that comes from the wife 's unselfish but mistaken suppression of her personal feelings , but the solution of each is due to the exercise of the same virtue , prompted by a deep and moving passion .

		The lightness and charm of the style in which they are told , and the un - obtrusive epigrams that are to be found here and there , cover a sound and serious psychology which gives these otherwise somewhat slight stories a verv real value .

		YASHKA : MY LIFE AS PEASANT , OFFICER AND EXILE .

		By
Maria Botchkareva	PERSON	.

		Stokes ;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		The story of
Maria Botchkareva	ORGANIZATION	, as set down by
Isaac Don Levine	PERSON	, may be recommended to all lovers of a thrilling tale .

		To enemies of the Bol - sheviki it has the added charm of painting a blood - freezing picture of Bolshevism .

		A scene like that of the '' Bolshevik death-trap '' is , from both points of view , almost too good to be true : a field heaped with the corpses of murdered men ; Yashka lined up with twenty officers to be shot ; a humane Bolshevik -LRB- there are such , it seems -RRB- trying to persuade a bloodthirsty fellow-officer to grant a reprieve to
Yashka	LOCATION	; dramatic recognition of Yashka by a sol - dier whose life she had saved ; his noble `` gesture '' If you shoot her , you will have to shoot me first ! ''

		Yashka is saved , the twenty officers brutally mur - dered .

		Scarcely less exciting is the account of
Botchkareva	LOCATION	's early life , a story reminiscent of Gorky in its scenes of poverty , hard labor , floggings , drunkenness , brutality .

		Obeying an inner voice `` Go to war to save thy country ! ''

		Botchkareva exchanged the dreariness of Siberian exile ` for the miseries , the heroism , and the comradeship of the trenches .

		Alarmed at the crumbling of discipline under the flood of talk released by the Revolution , she conceived and carried out the organization of the
Women 's Battalion of Death	ORGANIZATION	, in the hope of shaming the men .

		The story of that battalion is the pathetic story of a lost cause .

		RISE OF THE SPANISH - AM ERIC AN REPUBLICS : As Told in the Lives of Their Liberators .

		By

		Appleton ;
$ 3	MONEY	.

		The American side of Spanish history is for us and must eventually become for the whole world the important side .

		As a European state
Spain	LOCATION	will live long and be remembered ; but it is as an Amer - ican civilization that she bids fair to become great .

		Spanish histories , limited as is
Chapman	PERSON	's , glance with too indirect an eye at the Indies ; the interest and intention are present , and the publishers very properly advertise that an understanding of Spanish America must be founded in an understanding of
Spain	LOCATION	; but it is impossible for a historian who is dealing with a mother country to see centrally her colonial empire the colonies must find their own historians .

		Professor
Robertson	PERSON	is among those who have of late embarked upon the Latin American voyage , and he brings us his early cargo in a series of studies of the careers and characters of those Latin American leaders
Miranda	LOCATION	,
Hidalgo	LOCATION	, Itur - bide ,
Moreno	PERSON	,
San Martin	LOCATION	, Bolivar , and others who in the years from
1808	DATE	to
1831	DATE	succeeded in forming independent republics out of
Spain	LOCATION	's vice - royalties and captaincies general .

		There is one should remark it first off an admirable propriety in this author 's mode of procedure .

		It is a bit old - fashioned nowadays to be writing history in terms of the biographies of heroes , the Plutarchian mode ; we are all for ethnical and physiographical and eco - nomic interpretations .

		But if there is a portion of the world where the biographical foundation is justified , it is surely
Latin America	LOCATION	.

		Its first con - quests were by men of overpowering wills and vis - ionary ambitions
Cortes	PERSON	,
Pizarro	PERSON	,
Columbus	LOCATION	him - self , and that maddest of extravagants ,
Lope de Aguirre	LOCATION	and its later history has won for the whole continent , if not the name , at least the flavor of a
Paradise of Dictators	ORGANIZATION	.

		The History of
South Amer	LOCATION	- ica is a standing refutation of the economic inter - pretation , and a standing invitation to the enthusi - asms of hero worship ; and no period of it , in this re - gard , is superior to that which Professor
Robertson	PERSON	here makes his own .

		The subject and the mode of treatment will themselves ensure him readers , which his book deserves no less for the results of original investigations , in
South America	LOCATION	and else - where , which he has incorporated in it .

Santo Domingo	ORGANIZATION	, or the
Dominican Republic	LOCATION	as it is officially termed , has had a career which , ever since the island of which it is a part was discovered by
Columbus	LOCATION	and brought under Spanish rule , has bordered on epilepsy .

		The historical sketch with which this book is begun covers nearly a hundred pages , in which revolts , guerilla warfare , murders , and conspiracies follow each other with amazing rapidity .

		The really eventful period of
Santo Domingo	ORGANIZATION	's career ended with the military occupa - tion by the
United States	LOCATION	beginning in
November 1916	DATE	, so that in two pages such is the tranquilizing effect of Uncle Sam the history is brought up to date .

		The remainder of the book is devoted to a somewhat detailed study of the country its topogra - phy , climate , fauna and flora , religion , government , commerce , finance , and kindred subjects .

		One noticeable feature is the author 's faculty of impar - tial exposition ; he writes almost with the detach - ment of a financial reporter , and , it must be admitted , with little more imaginative insight .

		In this day of the development of foreign trade , how - ever , the qualities possessed by Mr.

		Whither thou goest , I will go ; and where thou lodgest , I will lodge ; thy people shall be my people . ''

		How nobly she answered the test of that saying , even though fate had set her qoun - try against his country in enmity , is beauti - fully and dramatically told in this moving tale .

		THE DIAL
April 5	DATE	THE SKY PILOT IN No MAN 'S LAND .

		By
Ralph Connor	PERSON	.

		Do fan ;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.


Ralph Connor	PERSON	has taken a safe course in his latest venture in fiction .

		He has yoked the inspira - tional and the martial , and hitched them like a team of oxen to the solid but lumbering cart which has served him all these years as the vehicle for literary expression .

		Structurally , his story creaks ; of freshness of style there is none .

		His material abruptly to change the figure is of that tested weave which beguiles the ready-made mind , and the cutting and fitting has been carried out along ultra-conservative lines .

		Mr.
Connor	PERSON	invests his hero , a young missionary who has the physical attri - butes of Apollo , with a verbal reliance upon God which assures a marked religious flavor .

		Depend - ing upon that , he naturally leaves the finer demands of craftsmanship to providence , arid as a conse - quence the narrative is littered with nearly all the outworn counters of conventional novel writing which one can recall : '' From the furious scorn in his voice and in his flaming face she visibly shrank , almost as if he had struck her . '' ''

		Silent she stood , as if still under the spell of his words , her eyes devouring his face . '' ''

		Her hand held his in a strong , warm grasp , but her eyes searched his face as if seeking something she greatly desired . ''

		HEARD MELODIES .

		By
Willoughby Weaving	ORGANIZATION	.

		Longmans ,
Green	ORGANIZATION	;
$ 2	MONEY	.

		The poet who allows himself to be distracted by a sheer multiplicity of verse forms fashions a hobble which is almost certain to trip him .

		If he dips first into one form and then into another , and fails to fasten upon any inner guiding rule to steer his muse , the creature becomes tangled in the rhythmic underbrush , and comes out scratched and unhappy .

		This appears to have been the frequent fate of Mr. Weaving 's muse .

		He tackles so many little twists of rhyme , and splits his lines in so many unexpected ways , that one seldom is able to fathom the inner harmony which may lie somewhere in the wreckage .

		Intelligibility , though it sometimes seems to have lost caste among the majority of contem - poraneous verse-makers , still has some rights .

		It may be snubbed , but it ca n't be utterly ignored , as Mr. Weaving seems to have tried to do in these stanzas , called Robins : Small robins cheer the end of the year When need for cheering is .

		What bird doth sing so sweetly through the
spring	DATE	?

		My heart , aread me this .

		Richer maybe those songs of glee And wilder well I wis ; But sweeter none than sing small robins dun When all things are amiss .

		There is so much dashing about from one thing to another in Heard Melodies that the volume al - most gives the impression of exercises in versifica - tion .

		Occasionally , it is true , one is enabled to shake off this impression , for Mr. Weaving gives a sym - pathetic setting to a number of his themes .

		When he is content to sing , he is most sure in his art .

		Emotional undercurrents have a trick of churning his verse into choppy waves .

		PORTRAITS OF
WHISTLER	LOCATION	: A Critical Study and an Iconography .

		By
A. E. Gallatin	PERSON	.

		Lane ;
$ 12.50	MONEY	.

		Altogether fascinating is
Gallatin	LOCATION	's Portraits of
Whistler	LOCATION	, from its marbled boards to the collection of various and engaging portraits within .

		The Critical Study , if not noteworthy for its originality , is interesting for the lights it throws on
Whistler	LOCATION	's own estimates of these portraits and caricatures .

		It contains among other good things
Beerbohm	PERSON	's defi - nition of the latter as that which '' with the simplest means most accurately exaggerates to the highest point the peculiarities of a human being , at his most characteristic moment , in the most beautiful man - ner . ''

		The volume concludes with literary por - traits by
Arthur Symons	PERSON	,
Frank Harris	PERSON	, and others of a clever , sensitive , imperious creature , with the flight of a butterfly and the thrust of a rapier .

		Whether for the sake of the reproductions of oils and dry-points and charcoal sketches by such worthies as
Boldini	LOCATION	,
Rothenstein	PERSON	,
Charles Keene	PERSON	, and
Whistler	LOCATION	himself , or for the rounded figure of the man one gets from such different views of him , the gallery is full of brilliance and charm .

		It invites more of its kind , though it may be doubtful if another artist will repay his biographer in por - traiture as richly as the autocrat of the ten o'clock .

		AFRICA AND THE WAR .

		By
Benjamin Braw	PERSON	- ley .

		Duffield ;
$ i	MONEY	.

		This is a slight volume of a hundred odd pages , a half given to a few slight essays , the other half to the subject-title .

		The author sketches the
Africa	LOCATION	of today , the great prize for the imperialist and the exploiter , and asks that the German colonies be placed under an international tribunal , believing that this will not only work well for the Negroes in German Africa , but will benefit all the Negroes of the continent . ''

		England and
France	LOCATION	, the chief possessors , and
America	LOCATION	, whose aid really decided the war , will find themselves working together in colonization , missions , and education on a scale never before contemplated . ''

		The African should be wisely educated , trained in mechanics , farming , engineering , even in the professions , especially medicine .

		Those preeminently fitted to do this work , Mr.
Brawley	PERSON	believes , are the Negroes of the
United States	LOCATION	, and he ends his book with a. plea for the training of
American Negroes	ORGANIZATION	in the higher professional and technical studies that they may bring Western civilization to the black men of the African continent .

		The book is written in a delightful style .

		, THE CURIOUS QUEST .

		By
E. Phillips	PERSON	Op - penheim .

		Little ,
Brown	PERSON	;
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		We do not know whether Mr.
Oppenheim	PERSON	is bent upon forging his own five-foot shelf , but certainly he has made a brave beginning : by the testimony of a list published in the back of the present novel it is the latest in a brood of forty-four .

		Facing such a record , one is tempted from the critical highroad into speculative bypaths , there to marvel upon the methods of literary incubation which make possible so prolific an output .

		This assiduous production , at any rate , throws light upon the author 's occasional slump in inventiveness .

		It doubtless accounts for the framework of the present novel , in which Mr.
Oppenheim	PERSON	has turned to a device that is beginning to creak from overwork the devious adventures of a millionaire who wagers with his physician that he can start with a five-pound note and live for a year on his own resources .

		From this familiar
spring	DATE	- board , we dive into a narrative which whirls the young idler through the usual difficulties attending these eccentric figments of the best-selling imagina - tion .

		Our hero meets the usual types and the usual typist , and comes through the delightful ordeal in a manner befitting a gentleman and a millionaire .

		The complications are ample for the purposes of light entertainment ; the manner is tailored to the matter .

		The characters are artificially warmed into existence ; their relation to life is about as intimate as that oi the egg to the incubator .

		TALES OF AN OLD SEA PORT .

		By
Wilfrid Harold Munro	PERSON	.


Princeton University Press	ORGANIZATION	.


$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		The wild adventures of
Simeon Potter	PERSON	,
Norwest John	ORGANIZATION	, and De
Wolf Hopper	PERSON	's ship Yankee have stimulated the romantic fancies of many generations of
Bristol	LOCATION	,
Rhode Island	LOCATION	, youth .

		The outsider is given an intimate introduction to these historic characters in Tales of an
Old Sea Port	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Munro	PERSON	has published the
Yankee	ORGANIZATION	's log , the remi - niscences of
Norwest John	ORGANIZATION	one of the first Amer - icans to encircle the world via
Siberia	LOCATION	and a letter about
Simeon Potter	PERSON	, the most interesting of .

		the three .

		In
1740	DATE	, while on a privateering expedition against the French , Captain
Potter	PERSON	captured a mis - sionary father whom he kept prisoner for a few days .

		Father Fauque has reported the incident in a charming letter that serves as a corrective to the exaggerated tales of
Potter	PERSON	's strength as recorded by tradition .

		AFTERGLOW .

		By
James Fenimore Cooper	PERSON	, Jr. .


Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	;
$ i.	MONEY	Thrice fitting is the title Afterglow for the slen - der collection of poems by
Captain Cooper	ORGANIZATION	.

		The book is a posthumous publication ; it contains vague , sweet , and delicate expressions of quiet moods ; and it truly serves as an evanescent afterglow to the bulkier work of the poet 's great-grandfather .

		Oc - casionally there is a poem to be grateful for ; such a one is An Answer , a neat rejoinder to those scien - tific ones who attempt to mark out all life with lens and rule .

		But because these gracefully turned bits of metrical verse lack rarity and subtlety and depth , one is forced to conclude that the
Cooper	PERSON	literary talent , emerging from underground in the fourth generation , remains still only a talent .

		The best pages of the volumes are not poetry , but an essay at the back , on Religion , in which a forthright state - ment of values and of the need for self-realization is given in a manner worthy of
Randolph Bourne	ORGANIZATION	.

April 19	DATE	MR.
HUEBSCH	PERSON	has just published these books whose profound significance at this juncture is obvious : The British Revolution and the American Democracy by
NORMAN ANGELL	PERSON	`` A '' N interpretation of British Labour Programmes '' is the subtitle , but the book is far more comprehensive than that suggests .

		It is an examination into social , economic and industrial reconstruction as abruptly focused by the war .

		It explains the relegation to the past of political and national issues and the rise of issues based on new systems .

		It explains the presence of issues for which we are pitifully unprepared .

		Then , for guidance in our bewilderment , the author recounts British labor history , discusses its programme and relates it to our own problems .

		As if for good measure but really because the questions are indispensable to a healthy readjustment of this weary world Mr.
Angell	PERSON	adds a section under the significant title , `` The Dangers , '' con - sisting of these three chapters : A Society of Free Men or the
Servile State	ORGANIZATION	?

		; The Herd and Its Hatred of Free - dom ; Why Freedom Matters .

		There are two appendices : The Report of the
British Labour Party on Recon	ORGANIZATION	- struction and the little known -LRB- on this side -RRB- but important Lansbury-H ^ ro/d Proposal .

		-LRB- Cloth ,
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- The Govenant of Peace by
H. N. Brailsford	PERSON	In the confusion of partisan criticism and indiscriminate advocacy it will prove instructive to examine this con - cise account of the broad general prin - ciples that must govern a valid consti - tution for a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	.

		The English Review offered 100 for the best essay on the subject and the dis - tinguished jury included such men as
H. G. Wells	PERSON	,
John Galsworthy	PERSON	and Professor Bury .

		The vagaries of fate caused the best man to win , for Mr.
Brailsford	PERSON	is concededly the most capable exponent of the plan which , if carried out honestly , will make a decent peace possible .

		Mr.
HERBERT CROLY	PERSON	writes an introduction to the pamphlet .

		-LRB-
25 cents	MONEY	-RRB- CONCERNING MORAL OBLIGATIONS Publishing ` books , besides being a commercial enter - prise , may be a public service .

		A ` publisher who does not recognize his responsibility runs the same risk of be - coming a shyster , quack or hypocrite as a lawyer , physician or priest .

		The degree in which a pub - lisher fails to discharge his obligation to society may be measured by the number of perunas that bear his imprint .

		The
Taxation of Mines	ORGANIZATION	in
Montana	LOCATION	by
Louis Levine	PERSON	A title may be misleading .

		This is not a dry book .

		It is so closely related to the educational and political life of our time as to have caused the
Univer	LOCATION	- sity of
Montana	LOCATION	to suspend its author who was professor of economics , on the day after publication .

		Here is the first intensive study of the constitu - tion and laws , as they relate to taxa - tion , of a state in which monopolized natural resources preponderate in the taxable property ; of the merits of the system ; of the defects in the laws ; of the exhaustibility of the mines .

		In fine , all of the facts are presented im - partially .

		Remembering the relation of the
Anaconda Copper Mining Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		THE DIAL A FORTNIGHTLY How to Secure the German Indemnity Fv VERY MAN WHO WILL allow his reason full sway rather than his passions and emotions , every man who cares more about the restoration of
Belgium	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	and the other countries devastated by the Germans than he does about punishing the Ger - mans for the devastation , must realize that the only practical way to secure the great financial indemnity demanded on behalf of the devastated countries is to set the German people to work in productive en - terprise .

		There is , however , a real fear that if this be done the payment of the indemnity may turn out to be a boomerang injuring those who receive it more than those who pay it .

		This fear among the states - men of the Allied nations is well expressed by
Lloyd George	PERSON	in a speech made at
Newcastle	LOCATION	on
Nov. 29 last	DATE	, in which he said that
Germany	LOCATION	must pay the cost of the war up to the limit of her capacity , and then uttered these words : '' But I must use one word of warning .

		We have , to consider the question of
Germany	LOCATION	's capacity .

		Whatever happens , Ger - many is not to be allowed to pay her indemnity by dumping cheap goods upon us .

		That is the only limit in principle we are laying down .

		She must not be allowed to pay for her wanton damage and devastation by dumping cheap goods and wrecking our industries . ''

		In other words , the danger appears to be that if the Germans are allowed opportunity to produce and exchange , their competition will wreck the industries of other nations , causing unem - ployment and disaster .

		Already with the end of war , unemployment is becoming a serious problem everywhere .

		How then can the Germans be put to work without lessening the opportunities of em - ployment for the peoples of the Allied nations ?

		There is one way , perhaps , of side-stepping the whole question of giving Germans employment .

		It can be done by excluding them altogether , or in part , from access to the natural resources of their own country and then securing the indemnity by develop - ing those natural resources by means of Allied and American capital and labor .

		To be sure , we could hardly say that under such circumstances the Ger - mans would be paying the indemnity .

		They would simply be deprived of the opportunity to pay it , and the Allies therefore would have to pay it themselves , merely securing the advantage of free access to Ger - many 's natural resources .

		In addition , in so far as the Germans were de - prived of access to their natural resources , their mines , their agricultural lands and so on , they would become unable to help themselves and would there - fore starve or become the objects of Allied and American charity .

		Neither of these alternatives can be considered .

		On humanitarian grounds alone the first alternative is out of the question ; and further , in either case , a stupendous army of oc - cupation would be required to war upon the German people whether the object were to pauperize them or to starve them .

		We can not avoid , therefore , giv - ing employment to the German people if we desire the indemnity paid , and the larger the indemnity de - manded the greater must be the opportunities af - forded to German labor .

		It might be thought , however , that if German labor must be employed , then at least it should not be employed for the profit of German capitalists , but should be employed directly in the service of the Allied nations ; and it might be suggested , therefore , that Allied capital , or confiscated German capital , or both , should be used in the employment of Ger - mans in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		But to this suggestion of directly diverting capital to the employment of Germans in
Germany	LOCATION	all the laboring men in every Allied coun - try would protest .

		They will insist that , at this time of all times when employment appears to be scarce , all capital available shall be employed at home .

		Another plan of securing reparation , which has actually been suggested , is that German laborers shall be forced to go into
Belgium	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	and there be made to repair the actual damage done , rebuilding the shattered cities and towns , repairing the damaged mines , and restoring the devastated fields .

		This would look like stern justice to some people , who fail to consider that the particular Ger - mans forced into this slavery would almost surely be those least responsible for the outbreak of the war and the atrocities committed in carrying it on .

		Jus - THE DIAL
April 19	DATE	tice aside , however , it is certain that any such plan would be condemned at once by the laboring classes of the devastated regions .

		They would no more permit their jobs to be taken away from them in this way by Germans than they would permit the gov - ernment to use convicts as strike breakers .

		This plan too is entirely out of the question .

		It appears then that after all it will be necessary to permit the Germans to exploit their own resources by their own labor and capital ; and that the more quickly and effectively they are able to produce , the more quickly will the Allies receive the indemnities demanded .

		But does it follow that the Allied nations and our - selves should trade with the Germans ?

		If it will enable the Germans to produce more quickly and effectively , it would seem that the Allies ought to allow trade with them , and we also , if we desire to help the Allies ; but if , as
Lloyd George	PERSON	seems to think , the dumping of cheap goods will wreck British industries , or our industries , then surely we ought to think twice about it .

		How to secure in - demnity to a nation , without injuring the nation getting the indemnity , seems in truth to be a real puzzle despite the apparent absurdity of the idea at first thought .

		It may be that
Lloyd George	PERSON	, in warning against the dumping of cheap goods , refers only to the practice of selling goods in a foreign country at less than the cost of production .

		This seems unlikely , however , since any goods cheap enough to be imported from
Germany	LOCATION	, whether sold at less than cost or not , would if imported displace similar goods in the markets of the importing coun - try and would therefore be just as likely to wreck home industries .

		What is more , it would seem that cheap goods from
France	LOCATION	or
Italy	LOCATION	or from this country would also wreck the industries of
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		If , there - fore ,
Lloyd George	PERSON	is to allow the importation of such goods , he is in the position of permitting the destruction of British industries out of deference to his Allies ; or if , on the other hand , the danger from cheap goods is imaginary , he is then in the position of penalizing the Germans for no reason at all with the result that they will be less able to pay the indemnity .

		In fact , if the cheap goods argument is not a fake , it might be suggested that a good way for the Allies to deal with
Germany	LOCATION	would be to prevent her from exporting anything to the Allied countries and at the same time to forbid the German government to establish a tariff on Allied goods imported into Ger - many .

		In this way it might be argued that the cheap goods would go into
Germany	LOCATION	instead of out , and thus it would be the German industries that would be wrecked rather than those of the Allies .

		The first objection to this suggestion is that wrecking German industries would hinder the pay - ment of the indemnity .

		Second > however , and more important , the plan would not work out as above supposed because if the Germans could not export anything they would have no means of paying for the imports , and for that reason no imports would there be .

		To some it would seem that the best plan would be to allow nature to take its course , or in other words to permit trade between the Germans and other peoples without governmental interference .

		If is certain that if this were done , trade would soon
spring	DATE	up not only between Germans and English , between Germans and Americans , but also even be - tween Germans and French .

		Unless trading is mutually advantageous to the traders , it will not take place .

		On the other hand , if mutually advan - tageous , nothing will stop it except direct govern - mental interference .

		Perhaps the interference of government with the trade of its citizens may not always be harmful , but at all events it is certain that if the Allied governments are all going to put re - strictions on German trade , the Germans will not be able to pay the indemnity as soon as they other - wise could .

		Unless they can import raw materials , their industries can not prosper , and unless they can export their manufactures to pay for the imports , then they can not obtain the raw materials .

		They will have to be sufficient unto themselves , using only their own raw materials which are limited in char - acter ; thus their productive powers will be stunted and the indemnity will be hard to exact .

		Moreover , too much economic pressure on the German people will drive them into a bloody revolution and then all hope of getting reparation for
Belgium	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Serbia	LOCATION	,
Poland	LOCATION	, and
Roumania	ORGANIZATION	will be gone .

		The conclusion seems to be unavoidable that the Allies ought , for their own sake , to permit the Ger - mans to exploit their own natural resources with their own labor and capital , and ought to accord them also liberal trading privileges in order to in - crease their productive power .

		The Allies might very wisely go even further , however , and in order to insure that the productive power of the Germans shall be increased to a maximum , they might dictate to them just how the revenue required to run the
Government	ORGANIZATION	and pay the indemnity should be raised .

		The Allies may well insist that the method adopted be one that will stimulate productive effort , that will encourage the enterprising and industrious Ger - mans , and will prevent the monopoly of economic opportunities .

		This can best be done by making all owners of agricultural land , of mines , of water power , and of valuable urban sites pay over for the benefit of the
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 387 Allied governments as indemnity the full rental value of the exclusive privileges enjoyed through such ownership .

		These payments should not include rental for agricultural improvements , nor for mine shafts and machinery , nor for hydro-electric installa - tions , nor for buildings of any kind , but only rental for the privilege of exclusive access to natural resources .

		Such a plan ought to be welcome to the great mass of the German people .

		Sentimentally , it would make little difference to the factory hands , to the peasants , to the tenant farmers , to the employers , and to the owners of German capital if the rent which had in any case to be paid to the discredited
Junker	PERSON	and landlord class were simply passed on to the allies to settle the indemnity .

		Practically , how - ever , the plan would be of great advantage to the productive and enterprising classes since , in the first place , they would be relieved of taxation to just the extent that the Junkers had to pay ; and what is more important access to natural resources would no longer be open to them only at exorbitant prices , or closed to them altogether .

		The power of the land owning class to withhold natural resources from use or to demand for their use industry-prohibit - ing rentals would be broken .

		Being obliged to pay over to the Allies the f ull rental values of the natural resources , whether used or unused , the land owning class would be under the imperious necessity of rent - ing or selling to the industrious classes , or of giving them employment .

		No longer would it pay to own land and other natural resources merely to draw tribute from others .

		The plan would redound enormously also to the advantage of the Allies .

		With free access to the natural resources and raw materials of industry , un - employment among the German people would largely disappear .

		With the German people all busily engaged in productive enterprise , the indem - nity which the Allied nations desire to obtain as quickly as possible would be forthcoming in a re - markably short time , and the fear , moreover , that
Germany	LOCATION	might become a plague spot of revolution and anarchy , or be restored to its former autocratic masters , would soon fade away .

		At this point , however , the reader may protest that if this plan be carried out , the German people , freed from the shackles of monopoly , will be on the high road to becoming the most prosperous and happy people in
Europe	LOCATION	, if not in the world and this as a reward for their guilt in bringing on the most criminal assault on civilization in all history .

		True , but nevertheless the Allied peoples will have got what they wanted , namely , quick payment of the indemnity to the unfortunate people of the dev - astated regions and at the same time a stable gov - ernment in
Germany	LOCATION	, one neither aggressive nor anarchistic because of the happiness and content - ment of its people .

		If , finally , the question arises , how then should the Allied peoples gain an equal prosperity and con - tentment , the answer is plain : Let the Allied peo - ples , also , break the back of the monopoly of their natural resources by forcing the holders of those natural resources to pay in full for the value of their privileges , payments not to be made to any foreign governments , but to their own governments to be used for the benefit of all the people .

		Then the preposterous phenomenon of unemployment will disappear from among the Allied nations as well as in
Germany	LOCATION	; the laboring classes , freed from the com - petition of the unemployed , will secure the full value of their labor ; and the great captains of in - dustry , freed from monopolistic exactions , will be able to establish greater industries than the world has yet seen , in which the savings of the workers will be invested .

		Then will the time come when a
League of Free Nations	ORGANIZATION	will be in truth a permanent reality and the peace of the world will be definitely assured .

TUCKER	ORGANIZATION	.

		3 88 THE DIAL
April 19	DATE	Peace in Its Economic Aspects I.HERE ARE VARIOUS interpretations of Bolshevism , each easy , all insecure and tentative , some of them frankly conjectural .

		But it is safe to say that , in its beginnings at least , the Bolshevist movement was a protest against the political and economic aristocracy of feudal institutions .

		In this sense it was pro- foundly democratic in spirit , no matter how auto - cratic it may have become in its later methods .

		If , then , it is finally to align itself against the
Entente Powers	ORGANIZATION	, it will be in the essential conviction that , so far as the East is concerned , the Western war for peace and for the safeguarding of democracy has become transformed into a war for the preservation of economic aristocracy .

		Adequate understanding of the Bolshevist pro- gram requires complete abstraction from all its immediate economic fatuities and from its current excesses and cruelties .

		The facts become , then , so far plain in Bolshevist thinking : from a new political order there is no hope for eastern
Europe	LOCATION	.

		What - ever new thing may come , it will not be worse than what has been and still is .

		Therefore the powers that stand for economic aristocracy intend nothing that can be good in its bearing on the peasant and the artisan of the
East	LOCATION	.

		For them there is ultimately but one thing to gain ; in the failure to gain it they lose all .

		Their war is against feudal institutions , primarily in their economic aspect , and only secon - darily in their political aspect .

		For them political domination depends solely on its economic leverage .

		With the economic situation unchanged , nothing essential will change .

		Thus Bolshevism inevitably challenges the West , if the West is committed to the maintenance of the present property institutions of the
East	LOCATION	.

		If , then , the victors in the war are more interested in the protection of the vested rights of a landed proprietorship , and in the privileges of wealth , than in a new democratic political order in the East so conditioned on a new economic order as to democra - tize the participation in wealth and opportunity , the issue is drawn , the conflict inevitable .

		For the purposes of this issue , the West will have declared that it wants only such political democracy as is possible within the setting of a feudal economic aristocracy that its ultimate ideals are economic rather than political , and are economically aristo - cratic rather than democratic .

		In thus allotting to property institutions the first rank , its error will be so far greater than that of the revolutionaries .

		They also do not take their democracy at all too seriously .

		With them also economic ends are first political democracy a subordinate or tributary interest .

		Such political democracy as they intend is only as a means to a new distribution of wealth and opportunity .

		Such political democracy as the West will consent to is likewise to be submitted to the perpetuity of the economic order that the West holds good .

		But the
East	LOCATION	is probably right in its conviction that such political democracy as it cares for if it securely cares for any will , under eastern conditions , stand or fall with the economic democracy on which the East is wholeheartedly determined .

		The West ap - pears to be in the way of demonstrating its entirely secondary interest in political democracy to the extent even that it will deny it to other peoples , unless as conditioned on that economic organization within which its own ideals find their expression and their determining influence .

		Such quite obviously must be the Bolshevist inter - pretation of Western policies as they seem now to be developing .

		World peace takes on importance chiefly in its property aspect .

		And more significant still , such also appears to be the essential character of the Entente policies as they are implicitly reported in the formulation of the peace terms to be imposed on
Germany	LOCATION	the
Central Powers	ORGANIZATION	.

		How far in the prosecution of ^ the war have the interests of the common people been regarded ?

		In the peace settlement how far are they fostered ?

		In what de - gree is there basis for the Bolshevist interpretation and for the Bolshevist growing attitude of antag - onism ?


Germany	LOCATION	is , no doubt , to make reparation and indemnity to the limit of what is possible .

		It is therefore held that the German people are to be saddled with all the debt they can carry due allowance , however , made for the war claims already existing in favor of the investing classes of
Germany	LOCATION	against the taxpaying public .

		Not incred - ibly , indeed , these rights of German wealth may be postponed , in order of payment and of right , to the Entente claims the total always , however , to be conformed to the debt-carrying power and the debt - paying tolerance of the German people .

		Otherwise there might be socialistic agitations and menace to the security of property rights .

		The entire discus - sion assumes that whatever the penalties that may be imposed , these shall be exclusively at the charge of the German taxpayer .

		The property rights of the privileged classes in
Germany	LOCATION	are in no wise in question or in jeopardy .

		Peace shall mean that all property , even
Junker	PERSON	and Warlord property , shall be sacred .

		About this fixed stake all other interests are made to turn ; against this bulwark all other purposes beat and shatter .

		As
America	LOCATION	was prompt
1919	DATE	THE DIAL to conscript life for war , but up to the end pre - served in the main for wealth its option between investment and complete nonparticipation , so now , when war indemnities are to be provided , the future generations of
Germany	LOCATION	shall be mortgaged , in the full solicitude that German wealth go unchallenged and unpunished .

		Nor shall there be any slightest reference to the guilt that has attended the wealth , or to the innocence that will attach to the life .

		Thus , by assumption , the Entente peoples are to continue in the travail of their tremendous war indebtedness
France	LOCATION	in particular staggeringly fac - ing fiscal debacle and possible or probable future revolutions in revolt against intolerable fiscal bur - dens .

		But even for
France	LOCATION	, only such indemnities are contemplated from
Germany	LOCATION	as can be provided through bond issues for the future taxpayers of
Germany	LOCATION	to bear and meet .

		From all of this the Bolshevist draws fatally easy inferences .

		Not only is Entente thinking more con - siderate of Russian wealth than of Russian life , but logically so since it is more considerate of German wealth than of its own life or of its own institutions of political democracy .

		As earlier , when victory was still in doubt , it financed its war by allotting to domestic wealth mortgages against its future domes - tic life , so in precise parallel now , with victory achieved , it goes about to prescribe the war settle - ment .

		Not only as between German wealth and German poverty is the poverty to bear the burden , but even as between German wealth and Entente poverty it shall still be the poverty that is to pay .

		Not only shall your grandchildren and mine be paying war legacies of taxes to domestic bond - holders , but meanwhile the German Junker shall be collecting his rent rolls , the while also that he is cutting coupons from the bonds issued to finance the war that his progenitors contrived , and mortgaged others to themselves to pay for .

		Why is it if in the sacredness of all property these German bonds must be recognized that our children 's children shall not have the benefit of them to meet their tax obligations ?

		Why are not the rent rolls left at the disposal of the children of the victims rather than of the children of .

		the aggressors ?

		Why perpetu - ate the menace of this ruthless aristocracy even at the cost of all this monstrous and hazardous injus - tice ?

		Assume that innocent future generations must make their payments to some one that in this peace of justice we shall not move to protect the victim from the criminal in
Germany	LOCATION	that , so far as may be , and in the interests of peace , all war-wagers shall be secure in their plunder , so long as our withers remain unwrung why must it be also true that with our own welfare at stake , our own children the sufferers , our own poverty the burden bearer , we still enact that the German debtors shall account not to our own children , but to the children of the Junkers , the industrial captains , the banking mag - nates , the hereditary nobility , and the political aris - tocracy of
Germany	LOCATION	?

		Why not , in short , expropri - ate the wealth owners in discharge of the penalties for their crimes and in the protection of the inno - cent , who else must bear the penalties ?

		Why must the future Entente generations pay in place of the German , or any German in place of the finally re - sponsible and bountifully solvent criminals ?

		In terms of present prices and of present income resources , the wealth of
Germany	LOCATION	alone totals upwards of
1 60 billions of dollars	MONEY	.

		Eighty-five per cent of the .

		German lands are in holdings of over 15 acres .

		For plainly the Entente bonds have to be dfs - charged by some one .

		So much we provided for in the financing of the war .

		It is , however , clear enough that in terms of immediate cash payment no policy of expropriation would retire the bonds .

		But there is no need .

		The obligations do not so run .

		It needs merely that the German properties , the titles of proprietorship , be sold out to German small in - vestors or to the peasants and artisans , on long-time amortization payments .

		True , the working people , , would finally discharge the debt not , however , as taxes , but as purchase money to be advanced in the acquisition of their economic and political independ - ence .

		All the hardships would rest with the guilt .

		.

		The kept classes of
Germany	LOCATION	, shorn of their potencies of harm with the loss of their economic : leverage , could then go to work or starve fortu - nate even at this , in comparison with the victims that they plundered and massacred where they dicS .

		not starve .

		If the guilty are excused from payment ; the innocent their wives , their daughters , their descendants in general must pay instead .

		A Ger - man aristocracy living off its rent rolls and its interest collections , while the rest of the world is busy paying off war debts , is nothing short of mon - strous .

		It is , in fact , quite clear that a covenanted peace is of little worth if it leaves with the classes in
Germany	LOCATION	that contrived the war the will and the power to contrive another , and leaves everywhere among the masses of common people neither the will nor the ability to endure the terms of the cov - enated peace .

		Both these errors the peace plan as it is now formulated clearly commits .

		It matters little whether the war was won more in the interests of peace or in the interests of democracy , if with victory once achieved the record sums up into little or noth - ing accomplished in the interests of peace , and a good deal less than nothing in the interests of democracy .

		In the long run and ultimately , peace is subject to two conditions that nowhere shall there be an 39 THE DIAL
April 19	DATE	irresponsible ruling class to plan more wars abroad and nowhere subject peoples goaded by economic exploitation into revolution at home .

		Economic democracy with its working correlative of political democracy provides these basic conditions .

		The peace that we are covenanting provides neither , no matter how ingenious and adequate may be and , as I think , actually is the specific detail of organiza - tion .

		There are , in truth , in human affairs other and greater sanctities to be recognized than those of wealth and property .

		In grave emergencies it be - falls that even the sanctity of life must make way for higher issues .

		Just this is what conscription rightly means .

		Humanity may one day revolt against wealth grown intolerable in its demands and its privileges .

		For my own part , I accept the social expediency of individualism and of property hold - ing , however , neither of them as sacred , but each as wise within the limits of its social service .

		To my view , then , it is surpassingly tragic if either stands at the hazard of being done to death in the house of its friends .


H. J. DAVENPORT	PERSON	.

		University Reconstruction and the Classics 1 - T is A STRANGE THING to write an apology for the Classics .

		One might as well write in defense of the springtime dancing gaily northward in a mad riot of birds and flowers ; as well argue in de - fense of-sunsets , a Beethoven symphony , or the colors of a
New England	LOCATION	autumn .

		To attack the Classics is not so simple a thing as it would seem at first sight ; it is an attack upon all literary art .

		The folly of those who maintain that too much time is spent in the learning of the ancient tongues , and that Greek and Latin literature can be read as advantageously in English translations , is as obvious as that of the person who tries to convince us that it is sufficient to read the score of an opera without hearing it , or to see a photograph of the Matterhorn without taking the trouble to go to
Switzerland	LOCATION	.

		Such an argument may be properly styled an argumentum pigritiae , and is like the story of the boy who said that at the school which he at - tended they were never taught to make the capital letter Q ; first because it was a very difficult letter to make , and then because it did n't occur very often in English anyway .

		It is the flattest kind of truism to assert that in considering it as a work of art the literary form of a book is as important as the thought , but that is precisely what countless people disregard when they maintain that Homer or the Greek lyric or Plato can be read as profitably in modern English as in the language with which these authors beautified their ideas .

		To enumerate all or even a fraction of the reasons which have been brought forward for studying the Classics would be but a weariness of the flesh .

		The ancient fetish that the study of them constitutes a good mental discipline is , by some dispensation of
Providence	LOCATION	, dying away .

		-LRB- I should suggest Turk - ish or Chinese as a better discipline for the mind . -RRB-

		The predatory conception that a knowledge of the Classics is the distinguishing mark of every true gentleman is also disappearing .

		The materialistic champion of the ancient languages argues that a knowledge of them will help him in a medical or legal career to grasp more easily the difficult term - inologies of those professions , as also the ever-in - creasing vocabulary of modern books and periodicals .

		A thorough knowledge of the grammar of modern languages is said by some to be obtainable only through acquaintance with the classical languages .

		All these arguments have become as wearisome as the chatter of magpies , and when we hear them we instinctively put our fingers in our ears and hasten away .

		Much time has been spent by classical prop - agandists in reiterating these arguments , thinking , forsooth , that by quantity of reasoning rather than by quality they could prove their contentions .

		But the interest in the Classics has become less and less as time has sped by , until only the faintest vestige of their former glory remains .

		The war with its strident tones has - almost succeeded in drowning their timid voice ; though not entirely , for immortal - ity has been given them by the homage of countless poets of all nations and all times .

		May it not be that our old methods of teaching and our thread - bare arguments in favor of the Classics may perish in the present holocaust , and that , like the
Phoenix	LOCATION	, a new creature may arise , vigorous and strong , from the ashes of the old ?

		Vivat , floreat , crescat !

		It is instructive to notice the effect of the war on the Classics in one of our large
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	universities .

		The course in
Freshman Latin	LOCATION	, which ordinarily has a registration of over three hundred , this year has a total of fifteen .

		In the Sophomore Latin course one student is enrolled instead of the usual one hundred .

		The percentage of loss in the Greek department is about the same .

		At first it might seem as if the materialists had conquered , and that the Classics had perished ; but on the other hand , it may be quite as true that the war will prove to be beneficial to the IQI9 THE DIAL 39 1 Classics .

		In intellectual matters as well as in po - litical , war not only arouses hatreds and prejudices which never existed before , but also breaks down many preexisting traditions and smooths away many an international and intellectual antipathy .

		When I say that the war may be beneficial to the Classics I do not refer to those well-meaning prop - agandists who read papers at conventions on '' Latin versus German . ''

		For the gain in numbers which would accrue to Latin from any such purely nega - tive cause would be valueless to the Classics and what is vastly more important would be valueless to the student .

		What I do mean is that certain time - worn traditions and prejudices may be broken down .

		These exist both in the mind of the man on the street and in that of the teacher .

		The average busi - ness man , for example , thinks that the Classics are uninteresting , and that they have no relation to mod - ern affairs .

		The truth of the matter is that they are uninteresting to him because he has never been shown what their relation is to modern affairs .

		The teacher of the Classics , who is usually a specialist in a narrowly circumscribed field , presents the works of a particular author in a way which is broad enough for him for does he not see at each step a score of alluring problems which await solution ?

		but pitifully narrow from the point of view of the student who is to share in the burdens of commercial and political life .

		It sometimes happens that the qualities of a great scholar and a great teacher are to be found in one man ; but this is rare .

		The scholar and the teacher differ in kind as the dynamo differs from the motor .

		Now that the war is over , educational reconstruc - tion is as important , though not so much discussed , as physical and economic reconstruction .

		Students returning to their books from the battlefield and the training-camp are looking upon things with a more exacting materialism ; they have obtained a wider and fuller perspective of the world and of their needs in it ; they have learned to conceive the world as a great army , each part helping and explaining the other , in which isolated facts and theories , those hav - ing no connection with anything else , have no place .

		At the present moment , then , the Classics are in un - stable equilibrium .

		The classicist stands at the part - ing of the ways , one of which leads through the dry deserts of pedantry trodden , alas , much too often in the past !

		the other leading amid the ways of men who lived and loved and died without refer - ence to the ablative absolute .

		Autocracy in education must be banished as well as political autocracy ; and the classicist , instead of superciliously assuming that his subject will and must be studied by gentlefolk everywhere , must de - scend into the forum and pro ^ e that the Classics are of value to the whole world .

		It is pathetic to think of all the generations of men who have come with youthful eyes gleaming , eager to learn of the treas - ures locked in ancient books ; and then to think of how they have turned away with dull eyes and wondering hearts , finding in their mouths nothing but dust instead of the promised honey .

		There must be no half way measures in the class - ical teaching of the future ; there must be no - luke - warm convictions about the value of the Classics ; for the youth of
America	LOCATION	does not partake of the nature of the ancient Laodiceans , and will believe a thing only when he is shown vigorously and beyond all cavil that it is so .

		The greater the prejudices to be broken down , the more insuperable the difficulties to be overcome , the more eagerly will the classicist apply himself to his task , if he really believes in the importance of it .

		It is now high time that we turn oxjr attention to the statement of a definite program .

		In so doing we must , of course , differentiate between the teaching of the Classics in secondary schools and that in univer - sities .

		In the secondary schools the main object must always be the mastery of the formal and syntactical elements of the language , without which no advanced work in the literature would ever be possible ; but inasmuch as this discussion has to do with univer - sity problems it is permissible to pass over those which have to do with elementary instruction .

		For university teaching two precepts may be stated which should be observed in teaching the Classics the one being self-evident , as it applies to the teaching of any literature , and the other being implied by what has already been said in this discussion .

		The first of these precepts is : So teach that you will reveal to the student the maximum amount of beauty beauty of thought , and expression , and structure .

		And the second is equally important : So teach that you will reveal the significance of a given work in the history of thought , that there may be no discon - nected fragments of learning seething about in the student 's mind .

		For in education , as in other fields of endeavor , union fait la force , and isolated bits of information are as worthless for the molding and guiding of a man as the asteroids would be for his habitation .

		It is this second precept which I wish to make the basis of the constructive part of this discussion , a discussion largely encyclopedic in nature , but based on empirical fact my own experience .

		A certain professor of music in a
New England	LOCATION	college once said that , although he enjoyed ' reading the Classics and considered the time he had devoted to them as well spent , he had never been able to dis -
39 2 THE DIAL April 19	DATE	cover any rational argument in favor of studying them , any convincing proof which he could use in de - fense of them against the attacks of the ever-pres - ent
Philistine	LOCATION	.

		An analogy finally occurred to him from his own profession .

		It was this : just as
Bach	PERSON	is the basis of modern music , - and in just the same way that a knowledge of
Bach	PERSON	is necessary for the musician if he wishes to understand modern music thoroughly , so are the Classics the basis of all
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean literature .

		The insistence on considering a work of art in its historical setting is tantamount to saying that that work of art should be considered simply as one stage in the development of a type , and obviously one must have some conception of the type as a whole in order to appreciate the importance and meaning of each particular stage in that development .

		Let us take as an example an actual university course , containing works of various authors , each representative of a different literary type : the Odyssey , the Greek lyric ,
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's Apology , and
Lucian 's True History	ORGANIZATION	.

		First let us consider the epic .

		Passing over all controver - sial definitions , all will agree , I think , that this is one of the earliest forms of literary expression , at least one of the earliest forms that was written down and thus acquired a certain degree of permanence .

		It is possible to find examples of the primitive epic in the early stages of most `` of the European languages .

		Beowulf and the Nibelungenlied , the Cid and the
Chanson de Roland	ORGANIZATION	are full of tales of personal prowess which are only more modern versions of the combats of Diomedes and Achilles .

		The Finnish epic , the
Kalevala	LOCATION	, is more primitive than any of these , containing the myth of creation as well as the exploits of a great hero .

		Later in the development of a nation 's literature come epics which are less vigorous in spirit and more formal in structure and diction .

		Of these scores could be named : the Argonautica of Apollonius Rhodius ,
Lucan	PERSON	's Phar - salia , the Italian epic of chivalry , such as those of Tasso and
Ariosto	PERSON	, and we might include here
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	's Faery Queen , the historical epic such as
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	's Henriade and
Camoens	PERSON	' Lusiads , and the religious epic represented by
Klopstock	ORGANIZATION	's Messiah .

		Midway between the primitive epic , hewn out of liv - ing rock , and the more modern , at times decadent , epic , there is a type which combines the vigor of the primitives with the felicity of expression of the mod - erns .

		Such are the Aeneid , the De
Rerum Natura	ORGANIZATION	,
Paradise Lost	ORGANIZATION	, and the
Divine Comedy	ORGANIZATION	.

		Such a broad view of many peoples and many lands , the variety of ideas and yet the astonishing similarity of ideals and unity of purpose observed in many books of widely separated countries and ages deserves much more to be called a liberal education than the ordi - nary parsing of verb and noun , or the fixing of the attention upon a single isolated work without refer - ence to any others of the same type .

		The obvious objection to such a program is that lack of time would forbid it .

		Of course it would be impossible for each member of a class to read all of these books , but it is perfectly possible for each one to read a different book and report on its contents .

		In this way a synoptic conception of the whole mat - ter is gained .

		Furthermore an interest in reading is aroused in this way such as would scarcely come about in any other , for the integration of the sep - arate parts , the focusing of the attention upon a single fact from varying angles , holds the interest of the student as no disconnected reading ever could .

		In like manner the lyric may be studied compara - tively .

		It is interesting , for example , to trace the development of one type , namely the elegy , from its Greek origin where it was distinguished by its coup - lets of alternately long and short verses , and was used for themes of love , war , and moral admonition , into its later Greek use , where it expressed sorrow at the death of the beloved one , then into its Latin environment , where it was still distinguished by the same form but was used merely for themes of love .

		In English the elegy is not confined to any rigid form of versification but in content follows the late Greek elegy as its model .

		This we see in such poems as
Milton	LOCATION	's Lycidas ,
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's Thyrsis ,
Swinburne	PERSON	's Ave atque Vale ,
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	's Astrophel , and
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	's Adonais .

		Plato 's Apology requires consideration from two different points .

		of view .

		First of all one should study
Socrates	PERSON	' significance in the history of phil - osophy , his changing of the center of gravity from purely cosmological questions external to man to ethical and social questions concerning man as an individual and in groups .

		To do this a knowledge of the pre-Socratic philosophers and their principal doctrines is essential .

		Secondly , one may study the Apology as a type of biographical literature of a very distinct kind .

		In the Apology we have an ac - count of a real human being , who lived unselfishly , who spent his days and nights teaching his followers to lead a rational life and therefore , according to his doctrines , an upright life .

		From the people as a whole he received nothing but jeers and curses and finally , due to a combination of a sense of humor and a sense of justice , he chose to die rather than give up his teaching .

		Here we have the por - trayal of the best man that the Greeks ever knew and it differs from their portrayal of that other great unselfish figure in Greek literature ,
Prome	LOCATION	- theus , in that the latter was a hero of the far-dis - tant past and consequently was credited with cer -
1919	DATE	THE DIAL tain divine or at least superhuman characteristics , whereas
Socrates	PERSON	was portrayed by his own disciple , with a certain amount of idealism , no doubt , yet free from all the trappings of divinity .

		How illum - inating it is to compare this life with the life of Jesus as given in Luke 's gospel !

		In these two ex - amples we have summed up one of the fundamental differences between the Greek and the Christian conceptions of life .

		The Apology represents a man who , by the exercise of his intellect , was raised far above his fellow men .

		The gospel shows us a man who , by some mystical connection with God , became something more than man .

		The one is a glorifica - tion of the intellect ; the other a glorification of the spirit .

		Lucian 's
True History	ORGANIZATION	is representative of a type which has been popular in all ages the romantic adventure .

		The literary progenitor of the type is Homer , particularly in that part of the Odyssey in which
Odysseus	ORGANIZATION	is represented as descending to the underworld .

		This type is of a two-fold nature : the one aims to delight through the sheer incredibility of the tale , the other uses the narrative merely as an instrument of satire .

		To the first division be - longs that part of the Odyssey already mentioned , as well as many of the Greek romances of the
Alex	PERSON	- andrian and Byzantine periods .

		Here also belong a large number of medieval French romances and the modern scientific extravaganzas of
Jules Verne	PERSON	and
H. G. Wells	PERSON	.

		To the second and much more important division , the satirical , belong a host of works which have been of the utmost importance in the history of literature .

		Here one must place
Lucian	PERSON	's True History and the Golden Ass of Apuleius ; here also Rabelais ' Gargantua and Pan - tagruel .


Don Quixote	PERSON	, which strove by satire to put an end to the romances of chivalry , finds a place in this group , as also Gulliver 's Travels .

		Voltaire 's Candide , which held up to ridicule the optimism of
Leibnitz	PERSON	, and
Samuel Butler	PERSON	's Erewhon and Erewhon Revisited , with their ridicule of Mrs.
Grundy	PERSON	and the Church of
England	LOCATION	, must both be included in this type .

		By the very nature of com - edy , which consists partly in hyperbole , and by the very nature of satire , which strives to destroy a thing by making it ridiculous , the romantic adventure has been frequently employed as an instrument of reform .

		To the reader whose interests are primarily esthetic and who believes that the value of literature consists in its intrinsic beauty , irrespective of the time and place in which it was created , this historical treatment may seem entirely beside the point .

		But the esthete 's point of view does not seem to coincide with the actual facts of experience .

		The knowledge of the history of a work of art illumines it and makes it more beautiful and more precious to the individual , just as with one 's friends or with one 's native coun - try , a knowledge oi its history , of its struggles toward perfection , of its successes and failures , makes it all the richer and more full of meaning .

		The appreciation of art is , of course , subjective , as one will readily admit if one consider the difference in effect of some supremely beautiful thing on a
Francis Thompson	PERSON	and on a
Fiji Islander	LOCATION	.

		If this is so it is obvious that the wider and deeper the experi - ence of a man and what is reading but a short-cut to experience ?

		the greater will be his appreciation of a given work of art .

		The historical or compara - tive method , then , not only is of value in itself but it reacts upon and increases the esthetic enjoyment , which , after all , is the main thing in art .

		Although much space has been devoted in this dis - cussion to a theoretical treatment of the reasons for approaching the study of the Classics from a his - torical or comparative point of view , we must not let matters rest on a theoretical basis alone .

		Theories in teaching just as in any other art must stand or fall by their effectiveness in actual practice .

		Teach - ers far too often have recourse to the mock logic of baffled parents : if you do not see now why you should do this , my child , do it because I ask you to , and when you have grown to be a man you will see that I am right .

		This is shifting the respon - sibility to the future instead of proving to the student that the Classics are worth while studying now .

		The teacher must respect the mind of the student if he will have the student respect the Classics .

		It is not necessary to `` descend '' to the intellectual level of the university student , and if the teacher does this the student will have no incentive to as - cend to the level of the teacher .

		The teacher must take the student into his confidence and fulfill in the present all the promises whose fulfillment has cus - tomarily been reserved for the future .

		Teaching of the Classics , as here advocated , has aroused a more vigorous interest not only in the Classics but in all literature .

		The conclusions here stated are the re - sult of my own teaching , proved in the class-room , the only laboratory which the teacher of literature has at his command .

		University reconstruction must be directed toward the reconstructing and reconciling of the nations , and this can most thoroughly and most speedily be brought about by realizing the essential oneness of the human race .

		The teaching of the Classics in the method hejre described is one approach to this end , for it shows the similarity of the aims and strivings of all peoples .

		Is not this the great func - tion of teaching that it should give a broader and deeper , and consequently more liberal view of the world in which we live ?

		ROYAL CASE NBMIAH .

		394 - THE DIAL
April 19	DATE	A Second Imaginary Conversation
GOSSE	PERSON	AND MOORE III 1V1 OORE .

		With Trollope I can shake hands more cordially than with
Scott	PERSON	, for it was not he who turned literature into a trade ; and in view of your pronouncement that every man writes as well as he can , I will ask you if it would not be hard to discern a line more adapted to the abilities
Trollope	ORGANIZATION	brought into the world than the line these same abilities discovered for themselves .

		He rose at sjx , and followed the road that leads to the par - sonage until it was time to go to the post office .

		The Bishop , the parson , and the Squire appear in suitable parts ; the young girl and the lover are supplied with admirable consciences and chaperons ; and between whiles there are pages , sometimes chap - ters , devoted to the subjects most likely to interest his readers sport , farming , the housing of the poor , and the condition of the junior clergy written about in a way that all may read without any disturbance of their preconceived opinions .

		In
Barchester Towers	ORGANIZATION	his admiration for nice conduct exceeds
Thackeray	PERSON	's , whose style he is .

		supposed to have con - tinued .

		The Widow Bold is perchance kissed at a party by a man she is not in love with an un - fortunate accident no doubt , but one that hardly warrants the solo and tears which he deems it necessary to measure out to her , and the soul search - ings that rack her : did she by look or word encour - age the horrid creature '' to suspect that I cared for him ?

		No , I certainly did not . ''

		In the fifties tears were more common than they are today .

		But it may be doubted whether even in the fifties the young ladies looked upon parties in which kisses were never exchanged as altogether successful .

		Tears are sometimes in fashion and sometimes out of fashion , but kisses , so the proverb tells us , are always in fashion , like the gorse flower .

		^
GOSSE	PERSON	.

		He drones like an old lady to her niece after tea .

		MOORE .

		It is not difficult , it is impossible , to write for the parsonage in good prose .

		A good writer adventures himself into windy Pontic seas , and the dangerous straits of
Abydos	LOCATION	, where the oyster is reared .

		GOSSE .

		I did not know you as a Vergilian .

		MOORE .

		Heloise led me to
Vergil	ORGANIZATION	I am writing Heloi ` se and
Abelard	ORGANIZATION	but we must abide with Trollope ... for the moment .

		Out of date Suranne ... The wake of the vessel has not yet disappeared into the gray expanse of water , and we catch sight still of those coasts whence we have come , crinolines , blue chamber ware , pink decanters , rep curtains , blue fingerbowls .

		These things
Trollope	ORGANIZATION	represents , and is endeared to us thereby .

		GOSSE .

		If his fame rests only upon these things ...
MOORE	PERSON	.

		His fame rests on a much more solid foundation .

		Trollope , in spite of his name , and his temperament which was in strict accordance with his name , was a great revolutionary .

		GOSSE .

		Your paradox puts me in mind of a line of Hugo 's : '' Des revolutions dans les ecailles d'huitres . ''

		MOORE .

		I would not have you speak disrespect - fully of
Trollope	LOCATION	, to whom we owe our freedom .

		We always count upon a reaction , and
Trollope	ORGANIZATION	carried commonplace further than anyone dreamed it could be carried .

		And it was when
Nature	ORGANIZATION	seemed to have been expelled definitely from art , that
Nature	ORGANIZATION	began to return to art .

		You have wandered over many seashores with your father the naturalist , and you can remember the drift and litter of seaweed with here and there a dying star - fish and many other derelicts of the sea that you could enumerate .

		You can therefore appreciate the comparison : Nature had retired like the sea ; only the faintest blue line remained on the horizon ; in I think the year was '48 in '48 three men met one night in a studio in a street off Oxford Street , Berners Street , or Newman Street
John Everett Millais	PERSON	,
Holman Hunt	PERSON	, and
Rossetti	PERSON	, to preach and to instigate the necessity of a return to Nature , and the following year the tide was then breaking over the evil-smelling pools .

		GOSSE .

		There 's generally something in what you say , and it may well be that the r ` eturn to
Nature	ORGANIZATION	which began in '48 was brought about by the stifling atmosphere of Victorian conventions .

		Millais illus - trated some of
Trollope	ORGANIZATION	's books .

		MOORE .

		The drawings he contributed to Orley Farm are the very best spirit of sense , and in his best Pre-Raphaelite manner , and persuade us almost that we have read the book .

		GOSSE .

		You overestimate their power .

		Beautiful as they are they can not persuade me to bear with the listless amble of that prose .

		MOORE .

		An amble listless as that of
Stevenson	PERSON	's Modestine , that no sapling cut from the hedge could urge into a trot an exasperating walk that tends to fall into a crawl , and that you fear will end in a nap by the roadside .

		1919 THE DIAL 395
GOSSE	PERSON	.

		It would be interesting to know if the book Orley Farm dropped on
Millais	PERSON	' knees , and if , looking through the studio he said to himself , '' My drawings are the condemnation of the text . ''

		MOORE .

		He was too eagerly concerned with his own work to give a thought to the merits or de - merits of Orley Farm , and acquiesced in the belief that novels were like that , and probably regretted that he could not illustrate without reading .

		Paint - ers are excellent judges of literature .

		GOSSE .

		He must have thought it strange ...
MOORE	PERSON	.

		Thought what strange ?

		Continue to put questions to me for every one helps to clear my mind .

		GOSSE .

		But Wordsw T orth broke the conventions before the painter .

		MOORE .

		It was the turn of the painters to do something for art , and by
Jove	ORGANIZATION	, they did it .

		Moral - ity was always less suspicious of painting than of literature .

		The naked woman banished from the one art was welcome in the other , and you must not forget that the novelist in the fifties wrote almost at the dictation of the circulating library .

		His works were published at 3/6 and distributed and collected by a service of carts .

		If the librarian did not think that his book made agreeable drawing - room entertainment it never was heard of again .

		The librarian was an autocrat , and no one dared to be original , even if he could .

		GOSSE .

		Do you think that this censorship has prevented the addition of a prose epic to our litera - ture ?

		MOORE .

		A prose epic implies the existence of a man of genius , and genius , I suppose , can not be censored .

		It will find a way out , so it is said , though all the doors and windows are barred up the chimney , through the keyhole .

		And if that be true , a first-rate genius did not exist in the fifties .

		GOSSE .

		You will perhaps agree with me that the Russians have on the whole produced the best story-tellers
Turgenev	ORGANIZATION	,
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	,
Dostoevsky	ORGANIZATION	,
Gorki	PERSON	, are all story-tellers , Tchekhoff too .

		MOORE .

		Yes , indeed .

		.

		The instinct of story - telling is in the Russians more than in any other race more than in the French , who have only had Balzac on the big canvas , and Maupassant on the ivory tablet .

		Story-tellers differ so widely among themselves that it is impossible to define the gift , but it is always recognizable .

		We perceive it in
Tcheh	LOCATION	- koff and miss it in
Trollope	LOCATION	.

		I will try to assimilate and compose our conversations into the form of an essay , stopping at
Trollope	LOCATION	, for it would be useless and perhaps unkind of me to continue my search for a story-teller among my contemporaries , but of the dead we may speak as plainly as we please .

		You have no idea how you have helped me ,
Gosse	PERSON	.

		You have done me a service that I shall always remember .

		GOSSE .

		One moment .

		You have forgotten Pater .

		MOORE .

		Whose
Marius	PERSON	, the Epicurean is the only English narrative that men of letters will turn to in the years that lie ahead of us .

		GOSSE .

		He applied himself to the art of writ - .

		ing ...
MOORE	PERSON	.

		He wrote the only prose that I never weary of ; but it was not of the beauty of his prose that I was about to speak , but of something which is perhaps as important .

		He wrote more about humanity than character .

		You remember the chap - ter entitled White Nights .

		He allowed
Marius	PERSON	to pass before us almost without distinguishing trait as a typical young man of all time ; and as a foil to the almost abstract
Marius	PERSON	, he set Flavian , whom the casual reader prefers , for character rather than humanity this was
Pater	PERSON	's intention in his portrait of
Marius	PERSON	' friend .

		You have set me thinking again ,
Gosse	PERSON	.

		English literature is not without a late - letter .

		If we look across the
Atlantic	LOCATION	we find one , and a marvelous one ,
Poe	PERSON	.

		GOSSE .

		It is indeed a surprise to me to hear that you admire a writer so essentially unhealthy as
Poe	PERSON	, one so concerned with the very hypertrophy of emo - tion .

		The very names of his characters seem to lead you out of the world of humanity one is at once in a region of ghosts :
Ligeia	LOCATION	,
Morella	LOCATION	,
Bere	PERSON	- nice ,
Eleonora	PERSON	.

		MOORE .

		I have sufficient faith in antiquity to believe it would have understood that all the poetry of life is in the fact that it is always passing from us .

		I will go further and ask you if it is possible for poet or peasant to love a woman in life 's daily usage as he does in remembrance , and if this be so why .

		should they blame
Poe	PERSON	for setting forth so representative of human life many beautiful symbols bearing women 's names ?

		Not content with the surface of life like
Trollope	LOCATION	,
Poe	PERSON	sought a finer distillation .

		GOSSE .

		Do you not think we should be drawn to art to praise life ?

		MOORE .

		I would avoid dogmatism , and the mere revival of the theologian 's formula seems too simple an expedient .

		GOSSE .

		What would you put in place of it ?

		MOORE .

		The artist is without dogma , or ` if you like to put it differently , he is his own dogma ; and to tell the story that life brought to him ...
GOSSE	PERSON	.

		Leaving out all philosophy ?

		MOORE .

		A philosophy is implicit in every well told story .

		GOSSE .

		What philosophy would you extract from the Iliad ?

		MOORE .

		That beauty is worth our pursuit .

		GOSSE .

		Stevenson !

		39 6 THE DIAL
April 19 MOORE	DATE	.


Stevenson	PERSON	is a butterfly content to enjoy the warmth of the sun and follow the scent of the flowers , and his enjoyment of these is so delightful that we join in the chase , children once again , led by a child ; and after a long day in the open air we return to relive our adventures in drowsy dreams .

		GOSSE .

		As you yourself pointed out in A Story - teller 's Holiday
Stevenson	PERSON	dropped into superficial thinking when he said that Catholics remained al - ways Catholics and Protestants always Protestants .

		He should have looked upon Catholicism and Prot - estantism as eternal attitudes of the human mind .

		MOORE .

		Indeed I think he should .

		GOSSE .

		In the pages that do not meet with your approval ...
MOORE	PERSON	.

		In the pages that I ventured to con - sider , to measure , and to weigh ...
GOSSE	PERSON	.

		There is a good deal that you must have recognized as true : the pleasure , for instance , that
Stevenson	PERSON	felt on finding himself once again in a Protestant atmosphere could not have been told at all by
Poe	PERSON	, who was not so great a master of words as
Stevenson	PERSON	.

		MOORE .

		A very inadmissible statement ,
Gosse	PERSON	, for how else but by the beauty of the words can you explain
Poe	PERSON	's poetry and that he wrote better poetry than
Stevenson	PERSON	will be conceded by all men of letters , and if you fail to nod your head approv - ingly I 'll write to Sir
Sidney Colvin	PERSON	who , though bewitched by his edition of
Stevenson	PERSON	's correspond - ence as he undoubtedly is , will not deny ...
GOSSE	PERSON	.

		So you look upon
Poe	PERSON	as a master of words , and his English as equal to
Baudelaire	LOCATION	's French .

		MOORE .

		You must have forgotten the beautiful opening of Baudelaire 's introduction ; let me recall it to your memory .

		Is there a devil Providence that bends over the cradles to choose its victims , and with malice prepense throws the purest spirits into hostile regions like martyrs into the arenas ; are there then souls dedicated to the altar who walk to death and glory through their ruined lives ?

		Baudelaire asks this question , for in view of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's life and his own he is minded to believe in this devil
Providence	LOCATION	.

		To know the lives of these two men is to share their mutual conviction that they were victims of such a
Providence	LOCATION	,
Poe	PERSON	even more than
Baudelaire	LOCATION	, for to this very day the ill luck that presided at his birth has not ceased it is implicit in your question : Is
Poe	PERSON	's English equal to
Baudelaire	LOCATION	's French ?

		The gift of the good fairy the beautifullest transla - tion , she said , that a man ever had shall be thine was overheard by the bad fairy who returned down the chimney and said , I can not take away the gift that the good fairy has given thee , but it shall be said commonly that thou canst only be read in trans - lation . ''

		Ma fiancee et ma compagne d'etude et enfin 1 ` espouse de mon coeur '' seems commonplace and trite when compared with '' my friend and my betrothed , who became the partner of my studies and finally the wife of my bosom , '' and we are con - scious of a drop when we read , '' Si jamais la pale Ashtophet de 1 ` idolatre Egypte aux ailes tene - breuses , '' and remember the beautiful English '' The wan and misty winged Ashtophet of idola - trous
Egypt	LOCATION	. ''

		And so On , through the beautiful pages of
Ligeia	LOCATION	, we can detect a delicate rise and
fall	DATE	, the original and the translation having the upper hand in turns .

		GOSSE .

		As is usual , a good deal of what you say is true , and I am with you so far that it can not be seriously maintained that a translation that fol - lows the original , comma by comma , full stop by full stop , can be said to possess great beauties of style that are not discoverable in the original .

		All the same , I think something happened in the transla - tion ; but you will allow that a less favorable ex - ample of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's style might have been selected ?

		In the story of
William Wilson Poe	PERSON	tells how the struggle between good and evil continues in the same individual till the evil overpowers the good .

		MOORE .

		And he tells his story without the help of magic potions .

		GOSSE .

		You have
Doctor Jekyll	ORGANIZATION	and Mr.
Hyde	PERSON	in your mind .

		MOORE .


Stevenson	PERSON	's story is no more than a popular version of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's , and I have always thought
Poe	PERSON	is himself implicit in the story of
William Wilson	PERSON	.

		Poe was a poet and a man of science , and although the poet was the stronger of the two , the man of science makes himself felt in the prose .

		GOSSE .

		Baudelaire 's service was to attenuate the diagrams .

		MOORE .

		There are diagrams in
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's prose sometimes , and festoons and astragals in
Steven	PERSON	- son 's always .

		GOSSE .

		As a writer you place
Hawthorne	PERSON	higher than
Poe	PERSON	.

		MOORE .

		A young man can not overlook
Poe	PERSON	, but he can
Hawthorne Hawthorne	PERSON	's genius not being so evident as
Poe	PERSON	's but if our young man be worthy of our consideration he will return to Haw - thorne in later life , and without losing any of his admiration for
Poe	PERSON	.

		One does not exclude the other , our estheticism should be wide enough to include
Michael Angelo	PERSON	and Phidias .

		When I enter
The House	ORGANIZATION	of the Seven Gables I walk about admiring the absence of accent .

		GOSSE .

		Is it not one of your little perversities to consider
Hepzibah Pyncheon	PERSON	as Greek sculpture rather than Gothic ?

		1919 THE DIAL 397
MOORE	PERSON	.

		As for Gothic and Greek , a truce to the discussion regarding their characteristics , for have I not seen little medieval virgins from Rhenish towns as ungainly as Greek maidens , and though there is nothing in Greek art as ungainly as
Hepzibah	LOCATION	, there is nothing that I can remember at this moment as modest in
Gothic	LOCATION	.

		But it matters nothing to me whether you call her Greek or Gothic if you admire her ; and as the two styles mingle in her I would that our twain admiration of her should f irn to one this
summer	DATE
afternoon	TIME	.

		GOSSE .

		Your talk of her the last time you were here caused
Sylvia	PERSON	to take the book from the s elves .

		It is on the table by you .

		MOORE .

		I should like to read to you the de - scription of the old maid and her agony of mind ...
GOSSE	PERSON	.

		The morning that she descends the old timbered stairs to open the shop for the first time .

		It is many years since I read it and it will come upon me quite fresh .

		The old maid was alone in the old house .

		Alone , ex - cept for a certain respectable and orderly young man , an artist in the daguerreotype line , who , for about three months back , had been a lodger in a remote gable , quite a house by itself , indeed , with locks , bolts , and oaken bars on all the intervening doors .

		Inaudible , conse - quently , were poor Miss
Hepzibah	ORGANIZATION	's gusty sighs .

		In - audible , the creaking joints of her stiffened knees , as she knelt down by the bedside .

		And inaudible too , by mortal ear , but heard with all-comprehending love and pity in the farthest heaven , that almost agony of prayer now whispered , now a groan , now a struggling silence wherewith she besought the divine assistance through the day !

		Evidently this is to be a day of more than ordinary trial to
Miss Hepzibah	PERSON	, who for above a quarter of a century gone by , has dwelt in strict seclusion , taking no part in the business of life , and just as little in its intercourse and pleasures .

		Not with such fervor prays the torpid recluse , looking forward to the cold , sunless , stagnant calm of a day that is to be like innum - erable yesterdays !

		The maiden lady 's devotions are concluded .

		Will she now issue forth over the threshold of our story ?

		Not yet , by many moments .

		First , every drawer in the tall , old-fashioned bureau is to be opened , with difficulty and with a suggestion of spasmodic jerks ; then , all must close again , with the same fidgety reluctance .

		There is a rustling of stiff silks ; a tread of backward and for - ward footsteps , to and fro across the chamber .

		We sus - pect
Miss Hepzibah	PERSON	, moreover , of taking a step upward into a chair , in order to give heedful regard to her ap - pearance on all sides , and at full length , in the oval , dingy-framed toilet glass , that hangs above her table .

		Truly !

		well , indeed !

		Who would have thought it !

		Is all this precious time to be lavished on the matutinal repair and beautifying of an elderly person , who never goes abroad , whom nobody ever visits , and from whom , when she shall have done her utmost , it were the best charity to turn one 's eyes another way ?

		Now she is almost ready .

		Let us pardon her one other pause ; for it is given to the sole sentiment , or , we might better say , heightened and rendered intense , as it has been , by sorrow and seclusion to the strong passion of her life .

		We heard the turning of a key in a small lock ; she has opened a secret drawer of an escritoire , and is probably looking at a certain miniature , one in Mai - bone 's most perfect style , and representing a face worthy of no less delicate a pencil .

		It was once our good for - tune to see this picture .

		It is a likeness of a young man , in a silken dressing-gown of an old fashion , the soft richness of which is well adapted to the countenance of revery , with its full , tender lips , and beautiful eyes , that seem to indicate not so much capacity of thought , as gentle and voluptuous emotion .

		Of the possessor of such features we shall have a right to ask nothing , except that he would take the rude world easily , and make himself happy in it .

		Can it have been an early lover of Miss Hepzibah ?

		No ; she never had a lover poor thing , how could she ?

		nor ever knew , by her own experience , what love technically means .

		And yet , her undying faith and trust , her fresh remembrance and continual devotedness towards the original of that miniature , have been the only substance for her heart to feed upon .

		She seems to have put aside the miniature , and is standing again before the toilet-glass .

		There are tears to be wiped off .

		A few more footsteps to and fro ; and here , at last with another pitiful sigh , like a gust of chill , damp wind out of a long closed vault , the door of which has been accidentally set ajar here comes Miss Hepzibah Pyncheon !

		Forth she steps into the dusky , time - darkened passage ; a 4all figure , clad in black silk , with a long and shrunken waist , feeling her way towards the stairs like a near-sighted person , as in truth she is .

		MOORE .

		How restrained and how full of seri - ousness and dignity , a portrait that Balzac would read twice over , recognizing in it a vision as in - tense as his own and better balanced , and
Turgenev	ORGANIZATION	would have recognized in
Hawthorne	LOCATION	's portrait genius akin to his own .

		GOSSE .

		It is a pleasure to listen to prose like that .

		MOORE .

		And it is a pleasure to me to hear you express approval as I read to you on a balcony on a
summer	DATE
afternoon	TIME	.

		You do think with me that no writer of English prose narrative has written like that before ?

		GOSSE .

		I would agree with you with more alac - rity if I were sure that my acquiescence would not provoke you to some unpleasant gibes .

		There is still
George Eliot	PERSON	to be considered .

		And I would willingly dispute the truth of some of the evil things that have been said about her if I were not altogether and utterly overcome by the graceful proportions and the temperate dignity of Haw - thorne 's portraiture .

		And we are conscious of his beautiful mind as we are of the sun behind yon cloud , illuminating it , filling it with poetry , of a beautiful
summer	DATE
afternoon	TIME	.

		Hawthorne was the first to understand the Pre-Raphaelites , and none has explained their art better than he .

		He wrote out of a well cultivated intelligence , and he recalls
Pater	PERSON	inasmuch as his desire , like
Pater	PERSON	's , was to make each separate sentence a work of art in itself .

		Nor are his gifts of vision and comprehension of human life exhausted in his portrait of
Hepzibah	LOCATION	; it breaks my heart that I can not quote
Clifford	PERSON	's portrait , for as it seems to me it stands on as high a level , in some ways on a higher level than any - thing accomplished by Balzac or
Turgenev	ORGANIZATION	, and to THE DIAL
April 19	DATE	compare it with the work of any English novelist would be as absurd as to draw a comparison be - tween Rembrandt and
Frank Hall	PERSON	, but it would take half an hour to read it aloud , and I will accept your promise that you read these pages when I leave you , in lieu of your attention .

		I turn down the leaf at the place .

		I must exact a promise from you that you read Phoebe too .

		A portrait of a young girl in her teens can never be carried further than a sketch , she being herself no more than a sketch .

		But was there ever a more beautiful sketch , one more instinctive with awakening life ?

		The book drops on our knees and we ask ourselves what her womanhood will bring forth in fateful happiness or blunder .

		It seems to have been part of Haw - thorne 's problem to stir the reader to musings of this sort , and very admirably he does , with
Phoebe	PERSON	's voice rising and falling to the pathetic tinkle of a harpsichord , pathetic always to our ears from its very inadequacy of sound and doubly pathetic are the tones of
Hepzibah	ORGANIZATION	's harpsichord , in this old tim - bered house .

		He ,
Clifford	PERSON	, would sit quietly , with a gentle pleasure gleaming over his face , brighter now , and now a little dimmer , as the song happened to float near him , or was more remotely heard .

		It pleased him best , however , when she sat on a low footstool , at his knee .

		GOSSE .

		Then we have come upon the narrative we are in search of ... MOORE .

		The harmony is not less expressive than the souls that fulfill it , and not less when we meet them in the torn uncouth garden , en - croached upon by the back yards of some near streets , and the speckled fowls , and the patriarchal cock that scuttles away from approaching footsteps , creeping through broken box hedges , than they were in the falling house ; and in keeping too are the words that
Phoebe	PERSON	speaks to the daguerreotypist in the garden , revealing her pretty soul and to its very depths .

		The daguerreotypist ,
Holgrave	LOCATION	, is the lodger ; he was there from the beginning before the arrival of Phoebe and
Clifford	PERSON	, and he too might have been .

		.

		.

		.

		GOSSE .

		So we have come to the might have beens .

		MOORE .

		You seem relieved by the prospect that our search may end in failure , thinking perhaps that it would not be in keeping to come upon per - fect art in a world that has outlived beauty .

		Hol - grave is of the unfortunate class in story-books the class that the author can not keep himself from in - tellectualizing ; Holgrave has been heavily intellec - tualized , and when he has finished his disputations with
Phoebe	PERSON	the reader is informed that he had visited
Europe	LOCATION	and found means before his return to visit
Italy	LOCATION	and part of
France	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	too .

		At a later period he had even spent some months in a community of Fourierists , and still more recently he had been a public lecturer or mesmerist , for which science he had very remarkable .

		endowments ; and a few pages later we learn this time without sur - prise that he is a frequent contributor to the maga - zines , and that he has an article in his pocket into which he has put an incident of the
Pyncheon	PERSON	family .

		He would like to read it to her , and hence - forth the truth , if it must be spoken , is that the story evaporates in the literary prejudices and con - ventions for which
Scott	PERSON	and his ilk are responsible .

		It is all very sad , and how this came about I am afraid will never be thoroughly explained .

		To whom are we to assign Judge
Pyncheon	PERSON	, who is stricken suddenly in death while sitting in an arm - chair facing the portrait of the original
Pyncheon	PERSON	, the witch burner ?

		Nor is this all behind the por - trait is the document he has long been in search of , for the discovery of it would put him into possession of the larger part of the state of
Ohio	LOCATION	.

		To whom are we to assign this plot ?

		The claimants are so numerous that I think we had better assign it to the English literary tradition of what a novel should be , and we should rather wonder that
Hawthorne	PERSON	succeeded in writing beautiful openings rather than that he failed to write perfect works .

		GOSSE .

		I am glad that you think that the age a man lives in influences his art as much as his indi - vidual talent .

		MOORE .

		I remember that you say somewhere that had
Tennyson	PERSON	been born in
1550	DATE	he would have possessed the same personality , but his poetry , had he written verse , would have had scarcely a remote resemblance to what we have now received from his hand ; and you go on to say that we are in the habit of describing a man 's originality as merely an aggregation of elements which he re - ceived by inheritance .

		If this be so it follows that the congenital commonplace of the English novelist is also an aggregation of elements that he receives by inheritance .

		We need not seek further for the extraordinary lack of art in English prose narra - tive .

		Our heredity is bad .

		GOSSE .

		There is no escape from that conclu - sion , unless we accept the alternatives that the per - fect molding of a story is alien to the genius of the race .

		MOORE .

		A somewhat cruel conclusion , one that I shrink from accepting , but it would be vain to pretend that it is not supported by facts and one of the most significant is
Hawthorne	LOCATION	, who failed to carry a story through .

		The Blythedale Ro - mance opened on a prospect of story that I read
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 399 tremulous with fear lest
Hawthorne	PERSON	's strength should fail him as it had done in the conclusion of his
House	ORGANIZATION	of the
Seven Gables	LOCATION	.

		The story rose higher , beautiful it seemed to me as a bird on wing ; and I said , on the two hundredth page , we are in
Eldorado	LOCATION	safe , for he will not commit so potent a mistake as to allow him who joins the community to return to
New York	LOCATION	or
Boston	LOCATION	till the end of the story .

		And asking myself if his art were suffi - cient to continue the story in the community , I looked to see how many more pages there were to read .

		About two hundred , I said .

		It was in the middle of
The House	ORGANIZATION	of the
Seven Gables	LOCATION	that he broke down .

		The strain became greater at every page , and after the splendid scene between the two men he could not do else but leave there was no other issue .

		But so great is an artist 's desire of the masterpiece that I continued to hope the impos - sible might happen ; by some miracle of genius , I said , he may be saved , and so vivid was his telling of the disquiet and sense of spiritual loneliness that comes over us on our return to the multitudes that it began to seem as if he had hit upon a way out of the difficulty .

		My hopes were at pitch and I waited , almost breathless , for the loosening of the clutch .

		Alas !

		he walked to the window , and on looking across a courtyard saw against the lighted panes forms that he could not doubt were
Zenobia	LOCATION	's I have forgotten the other woman 's name .

		They , too , had come up to town .

		After that the book drifted out somehow as inconsequently as
The House	ORGANIZATION	of the
Seven Gables	LOCATION	.

		GOSSE .

		Have you read The Scarlet Letter ?

		MOORE .

		No - ; and it is n't probable that I ever shall .

		Here ends the second conversation .


GEORGE MOORE	PERSON	.

		Cobden The Internationalist JLHE NINETEENTH CENTURY showed its trust in history by the fact that the monuments which it erected to what it recognized as greatness took his - toric form .

		Instead of confiding immortality to marble and bronze or poetry the Victorians erected the great structures of interpretation and documents known as Lives and Times , or Lives and Letters .


Lockhart	PERSON	's
Scott	PERSON	,
Masson	PERSON	's
Milton	LOCATION	,
Moore	PERSON	's
Byron	PERSON	,
Froude	PERSON	's
Carlyle	LOCATION	,
Forster	PERSON	's
Dickens	PERSON	, were followed by
Purcell 's Manning	ORGANIZATION	,
Liddon	PERSON	's
Pusey	PERSON	,
Morley	PERSON	's
Cobden	PERSON	and
Gladstone	PERSON	, and with
Moneypenny	ORGANIZATION	's Disraeli and
Gosse	PERSON	's Swinburne the fashion goes on .

		As the death of a rich man provokes the immediate question to whom does he leave his wealth , so that of a famous one moves men to ask to whom does he confide his reputation .

		The documented biography became a definite form of literary art and craftsman - ship which the nineteenth century made peculiarly its own .

		Some of its subjects live for us the more splendidly because of the monumental skill of their biographers , while others have suffered through a frankness or a clumsiness which has sometimes seemed a betrayal .

		Of the great mortuary artists of the Victorian School
John Morley	PERSON	may be accounted the chief .

		His
Cobden	PERSON	in
1881	DATE	was a high achievement , and his
Gladstone	PERSON	twenty years later established his rank .

		The completeness and justice of these works would seem to leave little scope for his successors , and one approaches the new life of
Richard Cobden	PERSON	by
J. A. Hobson	PERSON	-LRB-
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- with the feeling that it can be little more than a replica , a figurine or portrait bust for the library , reproducing the outlines of the heroic statue which
Morley	PERSON	erected for the cathedral or public square .

		Even so we might be grateful , for the highways of the world no longer lead past the memorial places where the last century honored its dead .

		In fact , however , Mr.
Hobson	PERSON	's life is more than this .

		By shifting the emphasis from
Cobden	PERSON	's early and best known activities in connec - tion with the repeal of the Corn Laws to his later application of his principle of free trade to foreign affairs during the period from the opening of the Crimean to the close of the
American Civil War	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Hobson	PERSON	has given us a new view of his subject , with a modern attitude and expression , and above all has placed his figure where the world can not fail to pass and see .

		The timeliness of the book is astonishing .

		It is as if the spirit of
Cobden	PERSON	had returned to take his place beside
Lowes Dickinson	PERSON	and
Bertrand Russell	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Hobson	PERSON	was fortunate in having new docu - ments to supplement those of which Lord
Morley	PERSON	made such conscientious use .

		The correspondence with Mr.
Richard	PERSON	, of the
Peace Society	ORGANIZATION	, and that with
Charles Sumner	PERSON	occupy most of the present volume .

		The biographer contents himself with a few pages here and there of connecting narrative , and for the rest lets
Cobden	PERSON	speak for himself the protagonist of non-intervention , internationalism , and pacifism in the years 1850-1865 .

		These were the years of the supremacy of Palmerstone in the councils of the British government , and with him , in the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	, on the hustings , and in 400 THE DIAL
April 19	DATE	the press ,
Cobden	PERSON	carried on a long and splendid duel .

		With
John Bright	PERSON	he threw himself directly across the path which
England	LOCATION	under the bad genius of her leader was following and dragging the world after her to its ruin .

		He fought the mischievous intrigues of
Lord Stratford de Redcliffe	ORGANIZATION	at Con - stantinople , the attempt to isolate
Russia	LOCATION	, the re - peated and foolish war panics founded on the imag - inary danger of invasion by
France	LOCATION	and resulting always in increase of armament , the bullying of the
United States	LOCATION	, the disgraceful aggressions against
China	LOCATION	and the border state of
India	LOCATION	.

		He recognized this policy as one of cowardice as well as selfishness and cruelty , and he did not hesitate to express his condemnation of the imperial part which his country had played , and of which
Palmerstone	ORGANIZATION	's activity seemed to him the culmination .

		His comment on recent English history is worth quoting indeed he thought so himself for he used practically the same language to two correspondents f o Mr.
Thomassen	PERSON
September 27 , 1852	DATE	-LRB- quoted in M rley -RRB- , and to Mr.
Richard	PERSON	two days later : I wish we had a map , on
Mercator	ORGANIZATION	's projection , with a red spot printed upon those places by land and sea where we have fought battles since
1688	DATE	.

		It would be seen at a glance that we have -LRB- unlike any other nation under the sun -RRB- been fighting foreign enemies upon every part of the earth 's surface excepting our own territory thus showing that we have been the most warlike and aggressive people that ever existed .

		And again : We shall do no good until we can bring home to the conviction and consciences of men the fact that , as in the slave-trade we had surpassed in guilt the whole world , so in foreign wars we have been the most ag - gressive , quarrelsome , warlike , and bloody nation under the sun .

		Nor did he confine his opposition to private cor - respondence .

		With the prestige which he had won by the prosperity which followed the repeal of the Corn Laws he addressed his countrymen fearlessly , even in times of actual warfare , defying the popular psychology , putting his reputation , his party , and almost his life at stake .

		He won a signal triumph of reason in the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	in carrying a vote of censure against the Palmerstone government for the outrageous bombardment of
Canton	LOCATION	because of the seizure by Chinese authorities of the lorcha Arrow , but in the election which followed
Palmer	PERSON	- stone set the country aflame with patriotism , Cob - den and Bright were defeated for
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, and the
Manchester School	ORGANIZATION	was almost wiped out .

		He carried through to success the difficult negotiation of a commercial treaty with
France	LOCATION	, to the immense advantage of both nations .

		Nothing speaks so elo - quently of the impressiveness of
Cobden	PERSON	's character and the strength which sheer conviction gave him as the fact that he brought
Louis Napoleon	PERSON	and his ministers to agree to this pacific measure at the very moment when
Palmerstone	PERSON	was rousing
England	LOCATION	to renewed armament against them .

		Twice he re - ceived offers from the Whigs to take office , once from Palmerstone himself , but he rejected the specious argument of the good which he might accomplish in the Cabinet .

		In this respect of utter integrity his career offers a contrast , of which he was not unconscious , to the brilliant opportunism of
Gladstone	LOCATION	.


Cobden	PERSON	's doctrines of non-intervention and paci - fism were the direct result of his faith in free trade as the solvent of war .

		As early as 1842 he wrote to Mr.
Ashworth	PERSON	: Free trade by perfecting the intercourse and securing the dependence of countries one upon another must in - evitably snatch the power from governments to plunge their people into war .

		With the example of free trade in
England	LOCATION	the
Manchester School	ORGANIZATION	thought that it had provided the world with a solid basis of international peace , a basis of utilitarianism .

		Cobden saw clearly that the structure of international economic service and advantage which he had planned would be wrecked by tendencies already manifest to replace the legiti - mate methods of gain by exchange of goods for the get-rich-quick device of exporting capital , be - cause , as Mr.
Brailsford	PERSON	has pointed out , while the exporter of goods has a natural interest in the prosperity of his customer , the exporter of capital , like any other money lender , often finds his advantage in the bankruptcy of his client .

		To the safety of this financial penetration of weaker and undeveloped countries
Palmerstone	ORGANIZATION	's Civis Romanus doctrine of protection to the property of British citizens in foreign lands , was essential .

		It appeared , a cloud not bigger than a man 's hand , in connection with the case of
Don Pacifico	PERSON	, a Levantine Jew naturalized Englishman , whose house was sacked by a mob in
Athens	LOCATION	and for whose avenging Palmerstone sent the British fleet to blockade
Greece	LOCATION	and
Cobden	PERSON	denounced him .

		Thirty years later when the cloud had grown to cover half the heavens with menacing blackness , Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	at the behest of the creditors of the Khedive sent the English fleet to bombard
Alexan	PERSON	- dria and put down the Egyptian nationalists and
Cobden	PERSON	's friend
John Bright	PERSON	resigned from the Cabinet .

		Of the fact that in his war against war CSbden anticipated the experiences of present day statesman - ship , Mr.
Hobson	PERSON	's pages contain many reminders .

		Therein consists the timeliness of his volume .

		The dishonesty necessary to maintain the war spirit was the theme on which
Cobden	PERSON	began his speech -LRB- at
Leeds	LOCATION	-RRB- against the Crimean War : My first and greatest objection to the war , gentlemen ,
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 401 has been the delusive , I had almost said fraudu - lent , pretences under which it has been made popular in this country .

		I mean that the feelings of the people have been roused into enthusiasm in favour of the war , by being led to entertain the belief that it was to effect objects which I know and felt , at all events , it never was intended to effect .

		The mischievous influence of the press on the public mind was a frequent subject of his attack .

		He quotes Lord Aberdeen as saying : '' It was not the Parliament or the public , but the Press that forced the Government into the war .

		The public mind was not at first in an uncontrollable state , but it was made so by the Press . ''

		In his arraignment of Palmerstone he declares : There is not the least doubt that
Palmerstone	PERSON	has , as
Disraeli	PERSON	said the first night of the session in reference to his use of the Press , made greater use of that means of creating an artificial public opinion than any other Minister since the time of
Bolingbroke	LOCATION	.

		He suggests a method of combatting this public enemy which Mr.
Henry Ford	PERSON	has applied : My object in writing is more especially to suggest a plan which I have often thought of that of going through The Times for about three years and taking out enough for a short pamphlet of its inconsistencies , false assumptions , unverified predictions , and bombastic appeals to the momentary passions and prejudices .

		He recognized the difficulty of dealing with pre - paredness : The money power , created by the vast sums voted for the support of the standing armaments of
Europe	LOCATION	, is the greatest difficulty we have to encounter in trying to reduce those peace establishments .

		He was heartily in favor of the freedom of the seas , with limitation of the right of blockade and immunity of private property at sea .

		He repeatedly advocated a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	.

		Except in the field of industrial relations there is scarcely a topic before the would-be makers of the new world todty on which
Cobden	PERSON	did not hold advanced views .

		Indeed it is with something like despair that one comes to see in our world only the realization of
Cobden	PERSON	's antipathies and fears , and to recognize that he fought the battle for peace more honestly , bravely , and consistently than any successor has done , but in vain , while the diplomacy of Palmerstone was writing the death warrants of English boys at the Alma and Inkermann , and of American boys at
Chateau-Thierry	LOCATION	and in the
Argonne	LOCATION	.

		ROBERT
MORSS LOVETT	ORGANIZATION	.

		Living Down the Hyphen 1 CAME TO
AMERICA	LOCATION	as I came into the world involuntarily .

		I have not always been able to re - joice over the initial journey , but my gratitude for being taken on the second one when I was five years old has increased with the years .

		It is this gratitude which now prompts me to relate something of my experience as an American of German birth .

		Per - haps my story may help a little toward a better understanding of one of the most serious and com - plicated problems brought on by the war .

		My first years in
America	LOCATION	were not happy .

		Un - like many foreigners , my parents settled among American neighbors instead of in a district pre - dominantly of their own nationality .

		As a result I was the butt of ridicule and the object of petty persecution whenever I appeared in the street .

		Fights without number , in which I was almost invariably worsted and ignominiously chased home , seem , as I look back , to have made up the record of my days .

		Sometimes my father took a hand , swoop - ing down upon a gang of tormenters like a terrible Nemesis , collaring some of the leaders and giving them a ringing box on the ears .

		Then others would be drawn in fathers or mothers or big brothers and we had tumults on a larger scale .

		Once in - deed shots were fired , though no one was hit .

		Thus we fought side by side , my father and I , for the simple privilege of going about our business un - molested .

		And together we hungered for the com - panionship of our fellows .

		Those who have not experienced it can have no conception of the isola - tion of an immigrant unsupported by a colony of his kind .

		The situation should have drawn us to - gether but it did not .

		It did not because very dif - ferent emotions were aroused in us by these early experiences : in him , a feeling of bitter disappoint - ment ; in me , an acute sense of shame .

		The wildest tales of conditions and opportunities in
America	LOCATION	had brought my father to this country , and he suffered disillusions of which I then ' understood nothing .

		As a result
Germany	LOCATION	, transformed by the magic of distance , had never seemed so fair .

		If going back to the country he came from were as simple a propo - sition to the immigrant as those assume who glibly suggest a return trip to the disappointed foreigner , I am sure my father would have died in the land of his birth .

		I , on the other hand , had come with no illusions , and being a child , lived forward .

		I had but one wish : to be rid of every trace of German about me in clothes , in manner , in speech ; to be free from the guilt which made boys and girls call me '' Sauerkraut , '' and yell after me , ''
Nix	PERSON	kom ' ` rouse Von der Dutchman 's house . ''

		In my childish extremity I called upon my gods , the angels .

		They could manage it , I knew , so that I would be liked instead of tormented .

		Then one 402 THE DIAL
April 19	DATE
night	TIME	I was awakened by cries of pain .

		I could tell it was my mother , and I faintly remember quivering all over and drawing myself together in physical sympathy .

		But presently I was sound asleep again , blissfully ignoring her agonies .

		And the next morning I had a new sister .

		My new sister brought an illumination .

		I still remember how clear it all seemed .

		The way out of my difficulty was to become a baby again .

		And so I prayed to be started over as a baby , an Amer - ican baby like my sister , with the power to grow so fast that before anyone would notice what had happened , I would be as big as I was before , only free from all trace of German .

		I had the most fantastic ideas as to how it was to happen , and enjoyed ecstatic moments when it seemed to me the change was beginning .

		And when the scheme of becoming a baby again had to be recognized as a failure , I invented a variety of others , with always the same objective to be an American , and con - sequently to be liked , instead of tormented .

		Thus while my father was looking wistfully back to the old country I was using what ingenuity I had to become one with the new country .

		Such was the beginning of the separation between us which was to become in time a spiritual chasm .

		Just when or how my father first became aware of my state of mind I do not know .

		When he did , he took drastic measures to keep me German in soul .

		I was never permitted to utter an English word in the house or in his hearing outside , and if he discovered my dislike for anything because of its German associations it immediately became his chief concern to see that I was most punctilious in my loyalty to that thing , whatever it was .

		Not very good psychology , but he followed the method rigorously .

		To lose me too was the last straw of failure .

		He could not bear it .

		Consequently , as my Germanism came gradually to be less of an occasion for annoyance out of doors , I began to be punished at home for signs of Amer - icanism .

		And my father did not punish psychically .

		Of that the scars I still bear are witness .

		When in the grip of the passion which seized him at every new sign of my defection , he lost all sense of justice and all humanity .

		But why go into details of cruelty and brutality ?

		He is locked away forever from my praise or blame in the hillside he loved , where the unrivaled redbud blooms in
May	DATE	and the pawpaw is heavy with strange fruit in
October	DATE	.

		Moreover , that miracle-woman , my mother , re - deemed and glorified even those horrible experiences .

		I remember them now without bitterness .

		My fathe ' r was strongly opposed to church religion , and one consequence of this was that he favored public as against parochial school education .

		Which was fortunate for me , but it intensified the conflict between us .

		I had a keen appetite for history and biography , and so devoured with avidity the romantic story of the settlement of
America	LOCATION	, and the dramatic founding of our nation .

		My mental furniture was soon as completely American as my love of country was fervent and intense .

		And how I hated the English !

		The same process which made me American made me anti-British .

		And of course I liked the French .

		They had helped us win the Revolution .

		As for all other nations , even
Germany	LOCATION	, they were names .

		My head knew of their existence , but not my heart .

		And what did it matter ?

		There was one country transcendently great and glorious , '' the land of the free and the home of the brave , '' my country ^ The crisis came when I was fourteen .

		For a year my father had threatened to take me out of school and now he said the fatal word .

		And my father did not change his mind in such matters .

		How vividly I recall the closing exercises of that year .

		They were to be my last .

		In the midst of them , while the speaker of the occasion was urging upon us the advantages of continuing in school , I burst into tears and rushed from the room .

		Going to work was easy enough .

		I had been accustomed to working after school and in the sum - mer .

		Indeed , my last year in school was purchased by working in a restaurant nights , sleeping when there were no customers .

		But a dull dread of Sep - tember grew upon me as the
summer	DATE	wore on .

		I stood it well into
August	DATE	.

		Early in the morning of the sixteenth , however , they found my good mother in a dead faint in the kitchen .

		She had just learned that the secret confided to her w r as out : I had left in the
night	TIME	gone to try myself out in '' the world . ''

		When I saw my father again much had happened .

		Instead of fourteen I was twenty-six , and he did not know me as we met .

		I had intended to do him the courtesy of talking in German , but my purpose to cut myself off from everything German had worked too well .

		My attempts only called at - tention to the thoroughness of my naturalization .

		Sentences begun in German were soon snarled and had to be unraveled in English .

		It was evident , too , that my loss of the German tongue was merely the outward manifestation of a complete spiritual change within .

		He did not seem to mind .

		We talked far into the
night	TIME	, seated in the old grape - arbor overlooking the river .

		Long streamers of dancing light red , green , yellow were flung to us from the dark bank across the stream .

		Now and then the deep-toned whistle of a river packet would announce that it was about to take '' the Bend '' and bear down upon the city ; and soon 19.19 THE DIAL 43 thereafter a puffing monster with two rows of fiery teeth , and one red and one green eye , would glide out from behind the ` black hills , just as when I was a boy and could tell each steam-boat by its whistle .

		We talked far into the night , but not about those days , the days that were uppermost in our minds .

		Somehow we could not manage it , or else we thought the reestablished relationship too precious to risk .

		Nor did we talk as father and son , but as men between whom some tragedy in the past has created a bond whidh holds them together while it keeps them apart .

		As I walked to the depot through the
summer	DATE
night	TIME	, with the katydids dis - puting in the willows along the river , and the Pleiades just visible over the eastern hills , I was conscious that I had experienced one of those ele - mental moments of life that introduce men to a new level of being ; and I learned afterwards that he continued to pace slowly back and forth in the garden until daylight .

		And so it remained to the end .

		There was something big about our relation - ship but also something somber .

		We approached , but did not meet .

		That was the tribute we paid to the foe of compromise enshrined in the heart of father and son .

		Well , as I was saying , much had happened in those twelve years .

		For one thing , I had graduated from college , doing major work in American his - tory .

		Lack of preparation and lack of funds made college a rash adventure , but youth does not take counsel of obstacles .

		I began to dream of it while still an office boy in
New York	LOCATION	, and in time the dream had its way , as dreams will .

		When the pre - paratory work was somehow accomplished , a far - seeing friend guided me to a college which was just then in a period of creative glory .

		It was at once a shjine and a work-shop .

		Inspired by a. new vision of life and guided by new ideals of service , pro- fessors , administrators , and students were cooperat - ing to make the institution a laboratory of social reconstruction .

		It was just the environment needed to clarifiy and illuminate my intense but uninformed Americanism .

		Here , too , in one of the professors , I found the man who gave the intellectual tone to my life which will , I suspect , remain its dominant quality to the end .

		As my teacher he introduced me to spiritual treasure of which I had not even suspected the existence .

		It was as if he had raised the blinds and opened the windows upon a new world .

		And if , looking out upon that world , I at first failed to see things which he thought it of most importance to see , and then gradually showed an interest in things which in his judgment were to be ignored because they were of slight importance , he did not , like the typical professor , lose interest in my career .

		He wanted me to be a voice , not an echo .

		Quick to appreciate any sign of mental vigor , but holding me to high standards of workmanship , generous in his endorsement , but straightforward and penetrating in his criticism where he thought me wrong , what he did for me in the field of in - tellect alone would be difficult to overemphasize .

		And his influence upon my mind only partly repre - sents the spiritual tradition which came to me through him and whic ' h I have tried to pass on to others .

		For our association was not merely a matter of brains .

		Together we enjoyed music , together we championed what we thought better ideals in edu - cation , together we worried over the prospect of art in
America	LOCATION	.

		Moreover , his influence was suffused by a rare personal quality .

		I was welcomed to his family circle in town and by lake side , and we were companions again and again in walking trips through some of the loveliest country my eyes have ever looked upon .

		Uplands warmed by the first breath of
spring	DATE	, great valleys asleep in the embrace of Indian
Summer	DATE	, bonfires with their trails of blue smoke , the smell of pine , the sound of waters , yellow moons and red suns such are the first memories my thought of him recalls .

		I have heard it said that the ideal relation between man and man is '' com - radeship in the achievement of glorious plans . ''

		If that is true , we were headed in the right direction .

		So year was added on year until when the war broke out in
Europe	LOCATION	I was myself a professor , proud of the privilege of calling my teacher my colleague .

		And I was accepted for what I was an American .

		Few people , to be sure , knew that the two thinkers most intimate to my inner life were
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	and
William James	PERSON	.

		Not many more were aware that I had returned from a stay abroad , where I had responded profoundly to the influence of the past , more alive than ever to the glory of a possible future
America	LOCATION	.

		But I was also American by outward signs .

		The fact of the matter is that there was nothing about me to raise the question of nationality .

		My name , while German , was not obviously so , and there was no trace of German accent or construction in my speech .

		I had no affiliation with German societies .

		My habitual associates , my intimate friends , my manner of life , .

		everything marked me as thoroughly American .

		Of the number who in one way or another chanced to discover my German extraction I do not recall a single person who was not greatly surprised , and many were even in - credulous . ''

		There is absolutely nothing German about him but his name , '' once said a German in disapproval of me , '' and that 's only `` half German . ''

		The outbreak of the war brought a great change .

		All my speculative thinking had prepared me to see in the European struggle the threat of destruc - tion to Western civilization , and I became more and 4-04 THE DIAL
April 19	DATE	' more pacifistic in my convictions as the war increased in bitterness and brutality .

		Doubtless my early dis - like of the British was an influence too .

		It was not easy for me to accept the English statement of the case at its face value .

		And perhaps something was due to subconscious ties which bound me to the land of my birth .

		I examined myself repeatedly on this matter and always came to a negative con - clusion , but such influences may be very subtle .

		All that I am sure of is that I fervently hoped the strug - gle might soon come to a deadlock , and that ou > r country might act as mediator in the interest of a better international arrangement .

		I found en - couragement in the writings of
Bertrand Russell	PERSON	,
G. Lowes Dickinson	PERSON	, and
Norman Angell	PERSON	, and with their aid I was able to translate my faith into a program .

		To my surprise , though not at all unnaturally under the circumstances , my attitude was inter - preted by many of my colleagues as pro-German .

		At first I paid little attention to these suspicions .

		They seemed so absurd , so obviously without foun - dation .

		Moreover I discovered that some of my critics were satisfied with nothing less than absolute moral and intellectual surrender .

		The expression of the slightest difference of opinion as regards the correct policy for
America	LOCATION	, was branded by them as pro-Germanism , and any concession made in the interest of harmony only led to their demanding others .

		Moreover , some of these colleagues were outspokenly pro-British , and others actually
Cana	LOCATION	- dians or Englishmen who , although at home in the
United States	LOCATION	for years , had never felt it desirable to become American citizens .

		It was foolish , per - haps , but I resented their attempt to instruct me in Americanism .

		Instinctively I assumed an attitude of aloofness and thus made matters worse .

		Then came the explosion which aroused me to the seriousness of my situation and made it clear to me that I was once more called upon to fight for the privilege of being an American .

		The day on which the papers announced our entrance into the war is one I shall not forget .

		The morning sun was streaming in through the window as I reached the office at the university which I shared with my teacher-colleague , and he was standing in the flood of it looking out over the campus .

		Apropos of my '' good morning '' and without turning around he said , '' I regret that hereafter our relations can not be what they have been in the past . ''

		My mind was preoccupied with the lecture I was about to deliver , so that I did not appreciate the real import of his remark .

		Besides , had I noticed his excited state of mind and had I known the cause of it -LRB- I had not yet heard the news -RRB- , the thing was so completely out of harmony with anything I might have expected that under any circum - stances I should have been slow to apprehend his meaning .

		I fear , therefore , that I made some such silly reply as , '' Is that so ?

		That 's interesting . '' ''

		You seem to take it lightly , '' said my colleague , turning upon me . ''

		I assure you this is no time for joking .

		I was never more serious . ''

		His frigid tone , rather than what he said , pene - trated my preoccupation .

		I felt as if ice-water had been poured down my back .

		`` What is the matter ? ''

		I managed to say . ''

		What have I done ? '' ''

		It is n't anything you 've done , '' he replied , '' it 's what you are .

		At last the crisis is upon us .

		From today on
Germany	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	will be at war .

		Unpleasant as it may be , no true American can any longer condone the divided allegiance of the Ger - man-Americans .

		It 's now a case of for us or against us . ''

		.

		N That afforded me a clue , of course , but only a clue ; for he had never given me the slightest in - dication that he suspected me of divided allegiance , and strange as it may seem , I had never thought of myself as German-American .

		At first I thought of myself as German , then as American .

		Never , as far ' as I know , did I represent that complex of mental preferences and attitudes properly called German - American .

		Not that I retained no admiration for anything German .

		What I mean is that my dedica - tion to American life and ideals was ardent , en - thusiastic , and whole-hearted .

		For a moment I thought my colleague was speaking in general and in the abstract ; that he did not have reference to me at all .

		But his face , white and tense with sup - pressed emotion , recalled his first remark and I un - derstood it in all its tragic import . ''

		You have known me now for ` ten or twelve years , '' I ventured . ''

		If , as result of that ac - quaintance or because of something you have just learned , you have concluded to strike me from the list of those you care to associate with , I can only bow to your wish in the matter , hard as I shall find it .

		But it seems to me that I am at least entitled to know what you are basing your action upon . '' ''

		I have already told you , '' he said , '' that it is n't anything you 've done .

		It 's your attitude , it 's what you are , and that 's what counts in a crisis like this .

		I have come to feel that just as a Jew is a Jew an exception here and there does n't matter so a German is a German . ''

		I have not the art to describe the effect these words had upon me .

		There was a feeling in my head as if myriads of tiny arrows were shooting through my brain and out into the roots of my hair .

		My throat was dry ; I could hardly speak ;
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 405 and my whole body seemed rigid and cold .

		It was a strange , hard voice that said : '' And what are we to do ?

		If your words could blast us into nothingness , or if you could spit us out of the country as you might some nasty taste out of your mouth , well and good .

		But here we are , by the hundreds of thousands , even if you con - vince us that we have no right here .

		What are we to do ? '' ''

		That is for you to decide , '' was his reply .

		I wish I had given free rein to the feelings which surged within me .

		I wish I had spoken the words that were on my lips : that he had no right to ex - clude me or any other so-called German-American from the '' us '' for or against which every citizen was now called upon to take a stand ; that until we removed ourselves from that '' us '' by un - American sentiments or acts we were as vitally part of it as he ; that I resented his arrogating to him - self the right to decide my status .

		I wish I had told him that his Scotch antecedents no more made him an American than my German birth kept me from being one ; that we were what we were , regardless of origins a doctrine which in better days he him - self had taught me .

		It would have cleared the air , and who knows what good might have come of it ?

		One thing stood in the way , the same thing that is responsible for serious racial antagonisms now developing in our country .

		That one thing was pride a pride which in him assumed a holier than thou attitude , and in me was too holy to defend itself .

		I said nothing at all .

		Looking back from this distance , it is clear that my colleague 's patriotic self-righteousness was the element of dross in a deep love of country .

		He unfortunately confused it with love of country itself , a confusion which , sad to say , is at present not uncommon .

		Only the most pro- found emotional upheaval can account for his action .

		I have never met a man temperamentally more fair - minded .

		Again and again I have marveled at his ability to arrive at an objective judgment in situa - tions where most of us were twisted to one side by an emotional bias .

		His performance in this case was so fundamentally unlike him , so out of harmony with what for years he had shown himself to be , that I should ' have paid no attention to it .

		I did n't and could n't .

		I have but this to say for my conduct , and that not at all by way of justification .

		My reaction was essentially a struggle random and unintelligent if you will , but sincere and vital against being de-Americanized .

		If a man has any spirit he can not go through what I had gone through to become an American and then calmly suffer him - self to be hyphenated .

		It goes without saying that I deeply regretted the interruption of a relation which had meant so much to me .

		But I failed to catch its significance .

		I re - garded it as a personal matter , as a misunderstand - ing between him and me .

		Since then , however , I have become well aware that the clash between us was symbolic of a national situation .

		And this is my justification for telling the story .

		For if the public mind is such that a keen , judicially-minded , cultured man is impelled to smother a whole class of his countrymen under one blanket of suspicion , what can be expected of men as they run ?

		And if one so completely Americanized as I falls under the common suspicion even in the mind of a friend , what chance have those who are less Americanized , especially those who are at the mercy of enemies ?

		Here is the seriousness of the situation .

		As far as I am concerned there has been nothing like per - secution .

		Nor has anything that has happened suc - ceeded in making me feel that I am German or even a German - American .

		I resented it , I confess , when I found that my German birth closed the door to service in a
Red Cross	ORGANIZATION	unit , and that even the
Y. M. C. A.	PERSON	, badly in need of men for
France	LOCATION	, could not send me out if it would .

		But I scored it up against '' military necessity , '' and thus somehow the psy - chology of it is obscure escaped the feeling that I do not truly belong .

		As for the proposal -LRB- which we hear in our town as elsewhere -RRB- that all who have German blood in their veins shall hereafter regard themselves , unless specifically approved , as spectators of rather than participators in American life , although it still arouses a temporary bitterness in me , I find it more and more possible to ignore , while I go on doing my work and planning to take a not unworthy part in the great task to which 1 believe my country to be dedicated .

		One can not , I know , set bounds to what a man may be persuaded of .

		I remember that in preparatory school we formed a conspiracy to make a Freshman believe he had the measles , and that he finally took to bed , a very sick boy , while the panic-stricken conspirators hastened to find a doctor .

		But somehow I have no fear whatever of being convinced that I am not an American .

		It is acknowledged to be impossible for a leopard to change his spots or an Ethiopian his skin ; how then shall a man change his personality and be someone else ?

		I am , however , afraid that many Americans of German ancestry who have not been as completely Americanized as I and who have thus been peculiarly open to suspicion and peculiarly liable to the unjust treatment which suspicion often breeds , will , unless we change our method of dealing with them , be made in fact what we have already made them in our imagination a group apart , a foreign substance in the body of our national life , and so the germ of a new and stubborn social disease .

		406
April 19	DATE	Patriotism and Its Consequences J.HE WAR , BY THE LAW of its being , produced articles which have no conceivable use in a civil community , and which could not be stored away by such a community without grave menace to its ex - istence .

		In the case of poison gas the War De - partment set an excellent example by dumping large quantities of the noxious compound into the sea .

		It is unfortunate that no administrative authority has power to deal with the fuscous states of mind which were likewise manufactured for purely bellicose pur - poses .

		A community that had an intelligent regard for the hygiene of its mental processes would con - sign vast quantities of its war books , pamphlets , newspapers , and judicial decisions to the ignomini - ous depths of the ocean rather than let the rising generation run the danger of contamination through contact on library shelves and bookstore counters .

		Foremost among books awaiting such disposal would be The World War and Its Consequences , by Professor
William Herbert Hobbs	PERSON	-LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		This series of lectures on patriotism which Pro- fessor
Hobbs	PERSON	tardily publishes points to conse - quences of the war that the lecturer was hardly introspective enough to explore .

		The doctrine of the single indivisible nation , the cult of the united front , the operation of the '' patriotic '' inquisition , the imprisonment and torture of heretics , and the like , are all phenomena worthy of attention in any exhaustive discussion of either the world war or patriotism .

		Toward topics of this nature , however , Professor
Hobbs	PERSON	is opaque , for the reason that it would lead to an examination of the state of mind which he , and the late ex-President , and a number of other worthy and honorable gentlemen not mere - ly accept but would like to perpetuate .

		The '' patriotism '' complex has made the name of peace loathsome to Professor
Hobbs	PERSON	: it literally passeth his understanding .

		His mind is at home only in that fumy war atmosphere which destroyeth all understanding , for it is in this element that all pacifists appear to be black traitors , and all '' patriots '' shining heroes of chivalry .

		One of the humors of the situation is that the wind which can carry the poison gas against the foe can also waft it back upon the friend .

		If the Industrial Work - ers are disloyal to the established government , what about the
National Security League	ORGANIZATION	?

		* Hence , it is amusing to see Professor
Hobbs	PERSON	close his last lec - ture with an unseemly attack upon the President whilst -LRB- with an eye that searches the audience for a
Department of Justice	ORGANIZATION	agent -RRB- he invites the gov - ernment to make the most of it .

		But of course this was merely oratorical camouflage : no sensible officer - would arrest such authentic `` patriots '' as
Henry W. Wood	PERSON	or
W. H. Hobbs	PERSON	.

		During the war men were sent to jail for their convictions ; they were asked to lecture upon patriotism for their suspicions .

		Now the war animus revealed in Professor
Hobbs	PERSON	' work was one of the most important psy - chological by-products of the war , and to those who accept the liberal point of view it appears at long last the most dangerous .

		The virulence of this ani - mus was not sufficiently accounted for in the liberal prospectuses , and the difficulty of handling it proved so great that within the executive department itself the spirit of the President 's first exhortation to fight without rancor was broken within a few weeks of the declaration .

		Perhaps the only writer who gauged this imponderable element at its full worth was the late
Randolph Bourne	PERSON	.

		Whereas in Ger - many '' patriotism '' helped provoke the war , in
America	LOCATION	the war succeeded in evoking an uncon - trollable quantity of '' patriotism . ''

		This patriot - ism of blind faith must be distinguished boldly from that genuine patriotism of good works whose other name is public spirit .

		To practice real patriotism is the first duty of a citizen ; to inculcate an in - stinctive and servile loyalty to the group , right or wrong , hell-bent or heaven-bent , is the first sub - terfuge of a commercial imperialist .

		Both varieties were stimulated by the war .

		The problem before us is to do away with '' patriotism '' the blind habit of running with the pack and following the leader on predatory expeditions and to maintain public spirit .

		It is a sufficient comment on Professor
Hobbs	PERSON	' beautiful opacity that in the course of more than four hundred pages he does not once attempt to make this elementary distinction .

		Unless this war complex can be broken up the prospects for a civil polity are not hopeful .

		The institutions of peacedom function freely only on a basis of divided loyalties and dispersed interests .

		Civil life means association , with the family , the trade union , the grange , the chamber of commerce , the professional institute , the church , the theater , and the forum intermediating between the life o the individual as an individual and his life as the member of a political -LRB- military -RRB- state .

		The war brought the individual face to face with the state and divested him of all associative interests , and in order for a state to continue on a footing ready for warlike emergency this intolerance of voluntary groups which refuse to merge themselves in the life
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 407 of the state will continue .

		In particular , the uni - versity , with its extensive criticism of the prevailing order in the economic and political worlds , is threat - ened with the same fate in this country as it met in
Germany	LOCATION	if the military conditions which operated in
Europe	LOCATION	come into existence here .

		Dr.
Claxton	PERSON	, the
Federal Commissioner of Education	ORGANIZATION	, has ration - alized the instinctive war complex by saying that '' the government of the
United States	ORGANIZATION	recognizes no groups .

		It knows only individuals . ''

		To accept his creed would be to carry one of the necessary products of the war into a realm where its presence is not merely useless but dangerous .

		By sanction - ing this philosophy Professor
Hobbs	PERSON	has done a dubious service as a citizen , and he has committed a traitorous act as a scholar , a member of that wider republic of science and letters .

		He places himself in that group of '' hirelings in the camp , the court , and the university , who , '' according to
Blake	PERSON	, '' would , if they could , forever depress mental and prolong corporeal war . ''

		LEWIS
MUMFORD	ORGANIZATION	.

		A Vindication of Fielding 1 N A CONVERSATION in Fielding 's A Journey from This World to the Next , Shakespeare is seen '' shak - ing his sides '' and exclaiming : `` On my word , brother
Milton	PERSON	, they have brought a noble set of poets together ; they would have been hanged erst have convened such a company at their table when alive . ''

		So Fielding himself might have enjoyed the incongruous position of mannerly critics who have bestowed post mortem commendation upon his art while they gave scant courtesy to his person .

		To the rescue of such uneasy persons , caught upon the horns of a prudential dilemma , now comes Pro- fessor
Wilbur L. Cross	PERSON	with a portrait of '' Field - ing as He Was '' which reconciles art and the bourgeois concern with the artist 's private life .

		To Fielding 's love of nature and truth , however , the mass of apocryphal legend which has accumulated about the facts of his life history would be abhor - rent ; and welcome to his love of fair play would be - Professor Cross ' loyal labors to remove from '' the shadow of
Arthur Murphy	PERSON	, '' Fielding 's , personal reputation .

		In this
History of Henry Fielding	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- 3 vols. ,
Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	, New Haven . -RRB-

		Professor Cross has added another to the little group of great biographies in English literature .

		He has reconstructed with much detail the life of a man who has left almost no personal documents .

		Lockhart ,
Trevelyan	PERSON	, Mrs.
Gaskell	PERSON	not only stood in intimate personal relation to the subjects of their studies but they had also the documentary aid of voluminous letters , journals , and other records .

		Not so Professor Cross .

		Over a century and a half after the death of his hero , a period during which , unexplainably , nearly all Field - ing 's letters had disappeared and other contemporary evidence had become scattered and blurred , he un - dertook the task whose patent difficulties had de - terred earlier biographers .

		Collecting laboriously the contemporary records here and there in letters , memoirs , magazines , newspapers , and archives ; sys - tematizing the results of the researches of other re - cent scholars , he compared these data with the state - ments of earlier biographers , testing and reenforc - ing his conclusions with the testimony in the writings of Fielding himself .

		The result is the story of Field - ing 's life year by year , often month by month and day by day , from boyhood to his death in the forty - eighth year of his age , a record supplemented by nine - ' teen photogravures of great beauty , and a bibliog - raphy -LRB- in part the work of that indefatigable Field - ing student , Mr.
Frederick S. Dickson	PERSON	-RRB- , which not only adds new data concerning familiar works but also contributes new items to the Fielding canon .

		The angle of Professor Cross ' approach to his sub - ject is as far as possible Fielding 's own .

		In his title , like Fielding , he uses '' History '' to mean : '' a biography , either fictitious or real , that places in the proper social background all the incidents in the life of a man essential to knowing him , in conjunc - tion with a sufficient account of the persons who bore upon that life for good or evil . ''

		This placing of the man in his milieu in such a way that the two shall be mutually interpretative , requires that a mas - tery of the facts of both the physical and spiritual life of an age shall be put at the disposal of a con - structive imagination quickened by emotion .

		This vitalizing of scholarship by warm personal sympa - thies is the source of the strength and of certain amiable weaknesses , I think which Professor Cross ' work displays .

		What
Viscount Morley	PERSON	's Recollections do for
Victorian England	LOCATION	, in its upper social reaches ; what the Letters of
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	do for the Cam - bridge group of the mid-century , revealing con - cretely the currents and eddies of political , social and literary life as they are felt by a man who is a part of what he has seen , such service The History of
Henry Fielding	ORGANIZATION	renders to
England	LOCATION	, especially
London	LOCATION	, from about
1730	DATE	to
1754	DATE	.

		The inside his - tories of the theaters managers , actors , play - 408 THE DIAL
April 19	DATE	wrights , and critics of the
Haymarket	LOCATION	and Co vent Garden and Grub Street close by ; the personal and factional conflicts of the
Walpole	LOCATION	ministry waged in pamphlet and journal and on the stage , until the Licensing Act put an end to the activities of Field - ing and his fellows ; the study and fellowship of the lawyers of the
Middle Temple	ORGANIZATION	; the sordid , arduous , and serviceable labors of the Bow Street Justice 's court ; murder and robbery in the dark city streets , diseases , doctors and their nostrums , brothels and masquerades , prisons and constables and thief-takers , lawbooks and lodgings ,
Salisbury	LOCATION	, Bath ,
Lyme Regis	PERSON	, and
London	LOCATION	, all these items enter as naturally and inevitably into this tale of real life as do the Flat-Iron Building and
Montgomery Ward	ORGANIZATION	's Tower into pictures of
New York	LOCATION	or
Chicago	LOCATION	today .

		Such landmarks of Fielding 's physical world , like the inns and roads from
Salisbury	LOCATION	to
Holborn	LOCATION	which mark the stages of
Tom Jones	PERSON	' progress , are at the same time the explanation of his inner life .

		For such a reconstructed world of eighteenth century
London	LOCATION	many students will be grateful , for it is the explanation not only of Harry Fielding and
Tom Jones	PERSON	but of other personages , historical or fictitious , of those times .

		Through this every-day world Professor Cross follows Fielding ; he portrays '' the handsome boy '' who comes to
London	LOCATION	in
1727	DATE	, perhaps , quickly win - ning his way in the theaters and also in the favor of Lady
Mary Wortley Montague	PERSON	his kinswoman ; the student , not of law but of ancient letters , at
Leyden	LOCATION	in 1 728-29 ; the anti-Walpole dramatist , and editor ; the romantic lover and husband , the affec - tionate and anxious father of a family growing while the income seems to shrink ; the faithful friend of rich and poor ; the tireless and humane Justice of the Peace laboring until sick unto death for the reform of men and of laws ; and finally , the social censor and lover of his kind , the same voice speak - ing sentiments much the same in drama , journal , essay , pamphlet , and novel .

		The last years of Fielding 's life
Professor Cross	ORGANIZATION	describes with a profound sympathy which dramatic - ally foreshadows the end with feeling of Nemesis .

		He shows us a gallant spirit adventuring bravely through the Valley of the Shadow which closes about him with the inevitableness of a tragedy of fate .

		We finish the story of The Voyage to
Lisbon	LOCATION	in a sad and exalted mood , which is our ultimate tribute to
Henry Fielding	PERSON	and to the art of his latest biographer .

		From this narrative Fielding 's personality and his work emerge with striking unity .

		There are no violent or incredible transitions .

		H. Scriblerus Se - cundus , Sir Hercules Vinegar , Sir
Alexander Drawcansir	PERSON	, and
Henry Fielding	PERSON	,
Esq.	LOCATION	, are one man playing in his day many parts .

		As Professor Cross writes in his final chapter : Fielding 's `` de - velopment under the stress of changing circum - stances was perfectly natural , and logical , like the development of a great character in a great novel .

		He had a mind most responsive to his immediate surroundings ; and therein lay the prime element of his genius . ''

		This unity of effect , together with certain per - sonal qualities essential to the portrait , distinguish this from earlier biographies .

		Yet in the midst of an admiring mood the reader pauses occasionally , as he reads through the volumes , to ask , at first hesi - tantly and then with more assurance , whether now and then Professor Cross does not commit the very fault for which
Frederick Lawrence	PERSON	and others stand condemned , that of letting '' fixed preposses - sion '' influence unwittingly his selection and inter - pretation of facts .

		Frankly he tells us in his pre - face that the work began with a prepossession , '' a surmise which soon grew into a conviction that the author of
Tom Jones	PERSON	could not have been the kind of man described in innumerable books and essays . ''

		The biography is surcharged with this thesis , which involves the destruction of that Fielding legend , initiated in the rhetorical essay which the incom - petent
Arthur Murphy	PERSON	prefixed to the
1762	DATE	edition of Fielding 's works .

		Two items in the legend are the chief objects of attack : the charge that Fielding led a life of dissipation , to which was due his poverty , sickness , and premature death ; and the statement that his works were written in haste in the intervals between the riotous incidents of his career .

		Led into paths of controversy here and there , Pro- fessor Cross gives short shrift to critics of his hero .

		Of
Richardson	PERSON	always anathema to your true lover of Fielding we hear that praise of
Tom Jones	PERSON	'' set his shrunken heart boiling with rage and envy '' ; Mrs.
Barbauld	PERSON	's essay is '' a thoroughly feminine production '' ;
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	is '' the last of the brilliant defamers , '' after whom come '' the twenty sane years from
Dobson	PERSON	to
Henley	LOCATION	, '' fol - lowed by a period of recent scientific research into the facts of Fielding 's life history , culminating in the present work .

		Though Mr.
Cross	PERSON	agrees in the main with the conclusions of these later scholars , readers will be startled at times by the ease with which statements of Fielding 's contemporaries are brushed aside when incompatible with Professor Cross ' thesis ; puzzled a little too as to the exact basis of selection between those facts in Fielding 's novels which may justly be considered autobiographic , and those which are not autobiographic but '' essential dramatic elements in his art . ''

		In many cases readers will assume that
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 409 the biographer has at hand data not evident to them , justifying certain procedures and assertions in
Field	LOCATION	- ing 's defense which appear captious or dogmatic .

		And they will conclude with the conviction that the truth about
Henry Fielding	PERSON	lies perhaps far above the level of personal character
Arthur Murphy	PERSON	de - scribed , yet since God made man a little lower than the angels just a bit below the amiable per - fection of the hero of Professor Cross .

		But after all the great value of
The History of Henry Fielding	ORGANIZATION	lies not in its defense of Fielding 's morals but in its realism in the presentation of the man and artist against the background of his times .

		As a rule it is the novel of manners , not the novel of purpose , which has the universal qualities which make for immortality .

		So it is often with bio - graphical writing , and especially is it true of the present work , that the qualities which give it charm and insure it permanence derive not from the author 's thesis , not even from his personal analysis of his hero and his hero 's works , discriminating and delightful as these are , but from the portrait of this hero playing a credible part in a fully peopled world reconstructed with the veracity and the imaginative sympathy of the creative scholar .

		Of such creative scholarship , remote from the genre of the average doctoral dissertation , American universities have hitherto given us too little .

		Liberalism Invincible 1 ERHAPS NO WORD has so diminished in prestige since the beginning of the war as the word liberal - ism .

		This has been due not merely to the extraor - dinarily facile collapse of supposedly liberal leaders before the emotion-provoking shibboleths of bellig - erency , but also to the deliberate creation of a popu - lar temper and attitude sharply hostile to all that the adjective liberal connotes .

		Modern war invari - bly brings to the fools and chauvinists of any country a glamour and prestige which they can not hope to achieve in the more rational atmosphere of peace .

		Consequently they have a kind of vested prestige interest in seeing to it that the mass of the people are kept at the same low intellectual level which is their own customary habitation .

		It goes without saying that all the great instruments of publicity the press , the universities , the church , the stage are at their entire disposal , far from unwilling to help them in their attempt to reduce the national atmosphere to the desired temperature of warm and unthinking animal emotion .

		The independent and fearless mind is cowed into silence or twisted by the social pressure into mere erratic - ism .

		The union sacree tends irresistibly to become , so to speak , the union degradee , for when a nation turns homogeneous in its thinking as it has to in war-time it must maintain its concepts at the lowest common denominator .

		Political heresy -LRB- in normal times , a mere personal idiosyncrasy -RRB- becomes a crime punishable by penalties more severe than were visited upon the religious heretics of the in - quisitorial age .

		Protest is greeted by savage and summary repression ; intolerance becomes the normal and accepted thing .

		Even a few months of this anti- liberal nationalistic hysteria is usually long enough to shatter the thin resistances of the intellectuals , and to render the popular temper which inwardly chafes at the artificiality of it all apathetic and dull .

		Competent observers in
Europe	LOCATION	, even today , months after the signing of the armistice , speak with growing concern of the atrophy of political minded - ness , the huddling back of the herd to smaller and more understandable groups than the abstract State for which they have already sacrificed almost beyond any limit of human endurance .

		This apathy of social awareness in the individual is especially nota - ble in
Germany	LOCATION	and the half-starved , neurasthenic small nationalities of south-eastern
Europe	LOCATION	; but it has not left even the victors untouched .

		It is a type of spiritual dullness before any other than immedi - ate and material issues a by-product of the bigotry and intolerance -LRB- as truly as of the suffering -RRB- of the war .

		It has brought the fact and the word , liberal - ism , into disrepute .

		For the true definition of liberalism would be a definition of a temper and an attitude towards life as a whole rather than an explication of a program .

		It would include the neglected virtues of candidness , willingness to examine the unpopular view , toler - ance , intellectual detachment , the desire for social experiment , humility before facts , historical back - ground .

		Liberalism is good-tempered and non - partisan .

		It despises the role of hired attorney for any cause however meritorious the cause may intrinsically be .

		It is frankly au-dessus de la melee , not through arrogance but through a pretty thor - ough conviction that perhaps the most valuable social service possible is the inculcation of the liberal attitude of mind .

		It is less concerned with the achievement of specific objects than with the crea - tion of that tolerant and intelligent social atmos - phere without which the achievement of any object is valueless .

		Consequently the liberal temper is seldom encouraged and usually not even allowed by 410 THE DIAL
April 19	DATE	governments in time of war .

		It is subversive and disturbing ; it breaks up the national unity and seldom yet has a nation gone to war with its cause so spotless that it could afford to be good-natured about its minority opposition .

		Certainly in this present war , which seems to be transforming itself , despite formal armistices , from nationalistic rivalry into a bleak class struggle , the suppression of all kinds of minority opinion has been especially ruth - less and far-reaching .

		It takes more than mere in - tellectual conviction to withstand the passions of the herd today ; it takes more even than the sudden , defi - ant courage of the irreconcilable .

		It takes , in a word , what a genuine liberal like Mr.
Norman Angell	PERSON	has never relinquished , no matter what social pressure the war has focussed on him the power of character to remain rational , sensible , fair-minded .

		Mr.
Angell	PERSON	is the enduring , the Socratian type of liberal .

		He does not allow the revelation of the appalling stupidity and prejudice of the mob which the war has given us to shake his belief in the final ability of the aver - age man to see the rational course of action .

		He has a passion for reasonableness , '' not , '' as he once said to the present writer , '' because I do not recog - nize the extent and massiveness of unconscious motives in the acts of people , but because the reason , slight and capricious though it is , is all that we have . ''

		He has been called the incomparable pam - phleteer , but this hardly does him - justice .

		His writ - ing is all of a piece .

		It is one extended and detailed attempt to persuade the person of ordinary intelli - gence to see the rational scheme of politics and affairs .

		What emotional drive it possesses comes from his democratic faith in the ultimate good sense of the common man and woman .

		It is sharply dif - ferentiated from either the incisive bitterness of so penetrating a critic as
Bertrand Russell	PERSON	, or from the fanatical and courageous doctrinairism ~ of a leader like Liebknecht , or from the somewhat sneer - ing petulance of a skeptic of war 's values like
Macdonald	PERSON	or
Snowden	PERSON	.

		It is more akin to the quality of
H. B. Brailsford	PERSON	's writing , although with less emotional intensity and likewise with less back - ground of European history .

		For Mr.
Angell	PERSON	's method has the defect of its virtues : it is sometimes careless of minor facts , however sound may be the main contentions ; it has the somewhat thin and ratiocinative quality of all predominantly hortatory writing .

		But it is infinitely patient before stupidity ; its feeling for justice and integrity is never once deflected by the plea of immediate expedients ; it is never bitter ; it never descends to invective ; it is always lucid and simple and non-patronizing and straightforward .

		Almost any book of Mr.
Angell	PERSON	's is a fine corrective to either the passions of war - time or to the apathy of peace .

		- It puts the reader in the frame of mind where discussion is possible .

		It really does induce in one the first act of intellect - ual honesty ` being fair to one 's , opponents .

		Tem - porarily at least , it makes the reader a liberal .

		Especially is this true of his latest book , The British Revolution and The American Democracy -LRB-
Huebsch	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The specific task of exposition which he attempts is not very pretentious .

		He merely tries to show how in
Europe	LOCATION	the war has raised questions which go far beyond those involved in merely politi - cal democracy , and the relevancy of these new ques - tions to our own immediate social and political future in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		He gives an excellent analysis of the program of British Labor , showing how beneath the formal demands runs a new note the desire for an entirely novel social order .

		He shows how industrial democracy has come to be the real question in
Europe	LOCATION	; how the conscription of life has raised inevitably the moral issue of the con - scription of income and even the whole concept of private property .

		He points out that merely state socialism has come to be regarded with even more suspicion by the workers desirous of a new status than the old capitalistic individualism .

		He explains how the questions involved in state socialism can not be escaped by
America	LOCATION	after the drastic war legisla - tion .

		And finally he reveals how , as during the Reformation it was the common man 's feeling for ordinary justice and humanity which finally de - stroyed religious bigotry , so , in all likelihood , it will be the common man 's new feeling for the community of interest of all who labor and surfer that will finally destroy modern political bigotry .

		Mr.
Angell	PERSON	's new book concludes with an essay which is of its kind a classic : Why Freedom Mat - ters .

		It is temperate and just and unanswerable .

		Our author puts his case so that it can not be chal - lenged : human happiness ultimately depends upon the quality of the society which men have made for themselves , and that quality depends upon the ideas of the individuals who compose it those ideas , in turn , upon freedom and independence of judgment .

		Without the latter a land flowing with milk and honey is spiritually a waste .

		Perhaps
the %	PERCENT	one great - est evil resulting from this war , even counting all the physical and material suffering and loss , has been its evocation of the spirit of intolerant parti - sanship , the willingness to kill and imprison because men could not agree with you .

		Men have been taught to rely upon the wisdom of blind majorities .

		Mr.
Angell	PERSON	can look back with pride upon his record in this war .

		He has done nothing to encourage and much to destroy this ancient and most tragic of human delusions .

1919	DATE
THE DIAL 411 Labor Control of Government Industries	ORGANIZATION	A MONG A NUMBER OF THINGS which we may lose through the general shuffle in international adjust - ment of affairs and exchange of thought , is the depressing idea which was gaining headway before the war , that public utilities could be administered by the state to the satisfaction of the common peo - ple ; that by some hocus pocus this transfer from private to public operation would confer benefit on the wage earners involved .

		The idea of state social - ism gained friends and made progress as it began to appear that the movement in that direction was not revolutionary , that it did not contemplate a greater control by labor or offer new opportunities for labor expression .

		It was essentially a revisionist proposi - tion , since it accepted the modern scheme of machine production , the division of labor , and routine employment as unalterable , and offered nothing in its stead or supplementary which might open up the environment to the common people so that they could take part more freely in the reshaping of it .

		The spirit of the movement was to make the best of a bad thing and carry routine employment to its consummation by eliminating , further than had yet been done , the workers ' responsibility through the centralization of management of enterprise .

		The idea seemed to be that if the direction of industry could be vested in the state the tendency in modern enterprise to eliminate interest in the processes would be advanced , and energy and thought could be saved for better things .

		The conspicuous loss of confidence of American socialists in state administration was occasioned by the war against
Germany	LOCATION	and all that it represented .

		That loss of confidence was increased by the discus - sions which center around the Russian Revolu - tion and the movement among the workers of Eng - land for status and control .

		As these events have emphasized the abortive results of state administra - tion the workers of
America	LOCATION	have become more conscious of the limitations which are inherent in civil service .

		Up to the present time neither American socialists nor trade unionists have offered any concrete working program which would replace bureaucratic management in public works .

		The syndicalist program of
the Industrial Workers	ORGANIZATION	is put forth in opposition to state socialism , but that program has not been worked out along lines which relate in practical application to actual problems of administration .

		I referred in a recent issue of THE DIAL to the proposition of the railroad workers for the administration of the roads .

		I alluded to the fact that while the proposition was presented as an alter - native to state administration , no provision was made for labor control .

		Control and management of railroad operations was vested in a board of direc - tors which was to be elected with due precautions against power of rank and file .

		Management was to be centralized , as it is commonly in the business arrangement of affairs .

		The election of the direc - torate was divided between the federal government , the classified officials , and the employees as distin - guished from officers .

		Having given the rank and file a voice in the determination of the directorate , ample provision was made for the overwhelming of it .

		In this way the scheme of organization denied at the outset its cardinal and avowed principle , the one that gave it validity , that operating rights should be awarded on the basis of ability to operate .

		If ability is in reality the asset of an operating scheme , it follows that provision must be made for its exercise .

		In the case of a business enterprise it is necessary to show ability to pay and provision for payment .

		In the case of a cooperative enter - prise it is necessary to measure the capacity of indi - viduals and to give that capacity the best possible conditions for expression and expansion .

		If the promoters of the railroad scheme should ever be called on to submit their asset that is their abil - ity to appraisement , they would be obliged to prove that their association was a well coordinated organization composed of members who were techni - cally equipped , conscious of their ability , their inter - dependence in the promotion of the enterprise ; that they were informed and intelligent as to the details of administration and the purpose and the policy of the enterprise .

		Having shown so much it would then follow , but not until then , that executive officers could represent the ability of the member - ship and irom this ability they would derive their sanction .

		An enterprise could not be run by a board of directors , in fact , if the membership of the asso - ciation represented ability to any important extent , and if it had the chance to exercise it .

		Our national psychology at the moment is more favorable than it has ever been for the kind of reorganization which is implicit in the events .

		A year ago the proposition which I here submit would have appeared Utopian , but it will be recognized at the present moment that it has its bearings on the current situation and its relation to institutional practices with which we have become familiar .

		I submit the proposition to the special consideration of civil servants who are employed in public service .

		To secure the maximum service from such public 412 THE DIAL
April 19	DATE	utilities as railroads , telephones , telegraphs , mer - chant marine , street railways , gas , electric light - ing , power and water supply .

		The federal gov - ernment in respect to the federal utilities named , and the state government in respect to the state utilities , and the municipal government in respect to the municipal utilities , shall issue short term operating franchises to self-governing associations which are made up of individuals technically com - petent and necessary in the promotion of the utility in question .

		These franchises shall : I , fix charges for service in consultation with the operating association , consistent with the costs of operation and with the welfare of the association member - ship and with the needs of the public ; 2 , require from the association a rental based on the per - centage return of the net income , which repre - sents in some approximate measure the value of the franchise which the community creates .

		-LRB- No association could be forced to accept terms dis - advantageous to the enterprise or to the members , but the board granting the franchise could hold open its offer until it was evident that no compe - tent association would accept the terms . -RRB-

		3 , fix the minimum requirement for upkeep and extension .

		The association receiving the franchise would be granted credit by a federal reserve or other public banking institution .

		It would be desirable for the franchise board to fix service charges , rent , and up - keep , not only to protect the public against extor - tion , but so that the net income would revert in its entirety to the membership in the shape of earned income and not by wages arbitararily fixed .

		The income could be divided pro rata among the mem - bers as the association from time to time determined .

		If an operating association holding a franchise failed to give satisfactory service , the franchise would be renewed only on conditions of reorganiza - tion .

		As the management of these organizations would be decentralized the temptation '' to play politics '' with the situation or within the organiza - tion could be largely avoided because under a scheme of decentralized government the '' plums '' of office .

		holding would not exist as they do now .

		The responsibility and the consequent power would be diluted as it was divided and shared .

		It would be to the advantage of the whole membership to secure members on the basis of ability , on the basis of technical equipment , responsibility , experience , and general intelligence .

		Charges for service would be fixed of necessity by the franchise board , together with the association , as price is a matter of interest to consumers as well as to the workers .

		In the case of public utilities which make no charge for service such as the public schools , or in the case of the post office which is run with a deficit , the franchise would be awarded the association to - gether with a grant determined as now on the basis of approximate cost .

		It is not possible to imagine a public service insti - tution organized on these lines that would not radi - ate some of the warmth and human interest which is now so conspicuously absent from all public employment .

		In the case , for instance , of the char - tered post office association each local postmaster and local postal clerk would be responsible to his peers , as he would be elected by them and kept in his office on their sufferance instead of '' holding down his job '' through '' bluff '' or '' pull . ''

		The bungling efforts of civil service reform , appoint - ment by competitive examinations , political patron - age would fall by the way , for self-government would look after hiring and firing in the interest of the enterprise and the association .

		Such a scheme of organization would offer local postmas - ters the chance to work out methods of economy which would result to their own advantage and to the advantage of their fellow workers in the saving of time and expense .

		Under the present arrange - ment there is no inducement for a post office employee ever to concern himself with efficiency .

		The public institutions which have been the most seriously perverted by centralized administration and quantative standardization are the public schools .

		A recent Superintendent of Schools of a large city was in the habit of observing that it was a matter of extreme satisfaction to be able at any time during school hours to consult his watch and to know at that particular moment that thousands of children were being drilled in some one lesson on a certain page in some textbook to which he could at the moment refer .

		For this satisfaction the thousands of teachers and the hundreds of thou - sands of children paid a colossal price in spiritual and intellectual vassalage .

		This example may illus - trate bureaucracy gone mad or centralized admin - istration carried to perfection .

		It is extreme but none the less it tells the story of bureaucratic management .

		It indicates , in the varying degrees of its imposition , the inhibiting results for teachers and children .

		If the schools in any measure meet the needs of educa - tion they must represent conditions which are as changing as the conditions of growth .

		This can only be assured when the teachers coming in direct contact with the individual children and their changing needs are free to meet and take up the problems .

		Teachers will not experience this freedom until they are suf - ficiently alive to the fact of their own enslavement in the system , and until they are ready to assume , the responsibility of promoting a school organiza -
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 413 tion which responds to the needs of the children and which translates their own present dull and thank - less job into a creative adventure .

		It would be unfortunate to leave the impression that bureaucratic management results exclusively from state administration .

		I have mentioned the proposition of the railroad brotherhoods which was opposed to state administration and in favor of an alternative which was no less bureaucratic in its promised results .

		The grave danger in
England	LOCATION	at the present moment is that the opposition to the movement of the rank and file of workers toward decentralized administration of all enterprise , will be able to convert the established trade unions into extra-legal organizations as much concerned to retain centralized power as any state or business cor - poration .

		It is not necessary to remark in ^ closing that the executive council of the
American Federa	ORGANIZATION	- tion would assume such position , if the occasion of - fered , with a sense of their mission fulfilled and their efforts crowned in royal fashion .

		Will the rank and file in
America	LOCATION	take care ?


HELEN MAROT	PERSON	.

		Experimental Schools IN STRANGE CONTRAST to the turbulent efforts of men to reorganize old institutions is the peace , if peace means quiescence , which continues without serious disturbance in the educational world below the university line .

		If some day the teachers of the lower schools are fired with a desire to experiment they will discover that they must take the adminis - tration of the schools as well as the formulation of policy and methods over into their own hands .

		That is what has been done by a few teachers here and there throughout the country who have realized that the school systems and education are irreconcil - able .

		The experimental schools which these teachers have promoted may have their relation some day to the general reorganization of the lower schools , as they show that if the method of growth of children is discovered and followed a larger field in a shorter period of time can be covered by the school .

		Such demonstrations will sow seeds of dissension in the world of the lower schools and even now , if the material which these experimental schools have brought to light could be assembled , something might be done to disturb the peace .

		To begin with , the experimental method is pre - eminently the method of little children .

		If we were at all observant we should not have to be told that the method is in good working order among babies up to the age of four or before they are consigned to some educational institution .

		Up to that time they are occupied with growing .

		They have experi - mented with their own small bodies to such advan - tage that they have acquired the art of walking , talk - ing , and the use of their hands .

		They have learned these complicated operations more rapidly than they will be allowed to learn anything else in the future .

		Why is it that schools bent on getting children over ground at a maximum pace reverse the lead which the children themselves give ?

		After children have acquired the degree of motor control which they commonly do during babyhood , they are confronted with the organized world around them .

		But their natural method of experi - mentation with this organized material is constantly inhibited , as their experimental handling of it inevi - tably comes into conflict with some adult possessive interest .

		Their activities are curtailed and regu - lated at home and their experiments are supplanted and forestalled at school .

		Experimental schools , in opposition to this practice , undertake to protect the environment of the children so that they may carry on their experiments with confidence and freedom .

		It is important to realize that the environment from babyhood to the sixth year must yield to the child 's method of play , and that play is the child 's applica - tion of the trial and error method of science to peo - ple and to the things about him .

		The kindergarten was founded on the play idea , but the kindergarten is a system of teaching the children how to play .

		The kindergarten acknowledges the play , activities of children in general , but not recognizing their desire to experiment , it undertakes to socialize the activities of a period which is distinctly individual .

		The
Montessori	ORGANIZATION	, distinguished from the kinder - garten method , is a system of training .

		It gives the children more freedom to move about in their en - vironment and to choose what they will do , but the material from which they have to choose is designed to train .

		The odium of teaching is transferred from the teacher to blocks , to bits of fabric , to weights , to sandpaper letters , and to figures .

		The children may not use this material to carry out purposes of their own , but only for the purpose for which it was originally designed .

		As the children 's use of material is limited , so is their development .

		Purpose and purposefulness are the striking signs of growth in the period which follows babyhood .

		In the Mon - tessori schools the children 's activities do not func - tion from their own point of view .

		The children 414 THE DIAL
April 19	DATE	build a stair but they can not put it to use .

		The adult intention lying back of each of the
Montes	PERSON	- sori training sets is completed when the object is complete .

		Putting the object to use might become a practice and so the adult intention would be lost .

		Both the teaching system of the kindergarten and the training system of the
Montessori	ORGANIZATION	are opposed to the method of the children 's experimentation .

		An experimental school , on the other hand , under - takes to be a part of the children 's environment , to watch the children while they grow , to discover and meet their growth requirements as they appear .

		Children can not be taught to grow , but they can be furnished with conditions which are conducive to growth .

		They can not be trained to grow ; our knowledge is necessarily insufficient , and always must be .

		If we undertake to train some one of the senses we may be stultifying others .

		Normal growth does not break up in this or the other direc - tion ; it takes place as a whole .

		In the experimental schools the teachers and the children are both the experimenters .

		The teachers are continuously trying out the value to the child of different kinds of materials and situations , and the children are continuously experimenting with the materials which are available and learning through these at first hand to make adjustments , generali - zations , and conclusions .

		The teacher directs the child to sources of information as well as material so that he may have the stimulating experience of answering himself the questions the experience excites .

		The questions and the answers point con - stantly to new fields and opportunities .

		The character of these opportunities is more or less dependent upon the location of the school .

		If it is a country school the teacher 's problems are sim - plified .

		`` The environment is .

		replete with raw mate - rial , that is , with matter which has not been made over .

		The child 's interests and processes in this environment naturally follow more or less physical laws of growth and are less complicated than those which he will meet in the city .

		But it is possible in the city to give children under six years oppor - tunity to answer the queries which the actual prob - lems of transportation turn up , and to follow with intense interest , if they are given the chance , the transfer of material by rail , water , or through the city streets .

		They will observe and inquire into cars , wagons , tug or * river boats , trains , delivery carts , with curiosity and with ability to understand the major part of the progression of such vehicles .

		Where are they going ?

		what makes them go ?

		what are they carrying and why ?

		are questions which result in lessons in economics , geography , and physics .

		But the actual knowledge gained is less important than that the children are learning how to observe and are forming habits of work .

		The pupils learn by living over in their play the experi - ences which their inquiries excited .

		In this play they need building material , carpenters ' tools , and toys which are representative .

		They require draw - ing material , and outdoor space where they can dig and build .

		They will use all material , if they are .

		given free access to it without suggestion , to try out on their own scale of operation what they have seen going on in the world about them .

		Somewhere between the seventh and eighth year the interests of children and their methods of expres - - sion undergo changes .

		Up to this time they have reproduced adult existence by the method of play .

		As they have made their acquaintance with material their desire to play with it is modified ; it does not fully satisfy them as it did .

		They want in part to turn the material or their activities to some real use .

		This does not mean that children at this time have turned from the world of phantasy to a world of reality ; they have always been interested in reality , but they have acquired a greater `` familiarity with it , and with the familiarity comes the desire for better workmanship .

		They want now for the first time some training and some teaching .

		There has been a general recognition that children were ready for both at this time , and the formal schools have under - taken to meet this requirement by giving them academic material ; but the acquisition of the three R 's is merely the acquisition of tools , and these are tools which fail to give children of this age the help they want in their translation of the real world .

		All this academic matter , which few children can put to any use , has the tendency to make life more visionary , less comprehensible and real ; its tendency is to make adjustment to the actual environment more difficult and the environment itself more remote .

		Many of the formal schools , in place of books and in place of hours of listening to the words of a teacher , are trying to meet the real needs of the children through first-hand experience in different forms of handwork .

		Whether the real need is met depends upon whether the applications are to things which are real to the children .

		Mere handwork does not suffice .

		It must be handwork with a pur - pose which the children understand .

		Incidentally the children turn to the formalized .

		material on which they are exclusively fed in the regular schools , as they discover here and there that books and figures are helpful tools .

		They learn the actual value of this academic matter as they experience its use .

		As children advance toward adolescence the ex - perimental method of dealing with environment has the same significance .

		The indication of growth at this time is the shifting of the children 's interest
1919	DATE
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	415 from the things which serve them individually , tp what as well serves others , and particularly what serves the adult purpose .

		Through this period social desires and realization are advancing on a cres - cendo scale .

		Teachers have more to guide them in formulating their school work for this period , for they are more in sympathy with the children 's minds .

		Having said so much for the experimental method , I must add that the contribution of the , experimental schools is as yet negative rather than positive in character .

		They can , for instance , dem - onstrate that the regular school systems which handle children in the mass and standardize proce - dure on the factory principle dwarf as well as retard the children .

		The experimental schools hope to set up standards , but when they do they will not be standards which can be standardized .

		They repre - sent a never ending line of experiences to be pooled , and they indicate advances which have goals which are as various and as changing as the goals of in - dividuals whether those are adult or juvenile .

		Then the eyes of death stare all men in the face , its nearness hurts , and we turn from it , and our poets and prophets extol the vigor and the passion of the life of battle , and orphans and widows and mothers are told to think only of the glories which their dead have saved , and not of the peace of the tomb .

		Rarely , in war time , do peoples look upon death undisguised .

		And in no other time , perhaps , have they greater need so to observe it and so to know it .

		Only the remote in time and spirit appear able for this , able to desig - nate its being and to find its right perspective .

		Four years of much war literature has brought us noth - ing out of the immediate worthy the dignity of death .

		So far as I know , there have been printed but two works adequate to the high call of the world 's tragedy , and both are evocations from the past .

		One came , early in the war , from the hands of the poet laureate .

		It was an anthology of the serenities and high places of the soul , of its quietude and self-possession .

		Its collector called it The Spirit of Man .

		The other was an English version of the noblest confrontation of death that litera - ture knows the poem of
Lucretius	LOCATION	, called Of the
Nature of Things	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , done into blank verse by
William Ellery Leonard	PERSON	.

		`` He has , '' says Mr.
Leonard	PERSON	of himself , `` loved Lucretius for many years , and the mighty spirit of the Roman has helped him to sustain many of the burdens of life .

		He can but hope that he has not altogether failed to communicate him to English and American readers ignorant of Latin .

		Lucretius is indeed a voice for these supreme times . ''

		That he has made a communication of Lucretius Mr.
Leonard	PERSON	may be well assured .

		He has uttered , in his own measure , something of both the beat and the passion of the Roman verse .

		His diction repro - duces the Lucretian abbondanza , and his pieties and perhaps his temperament are not alien to the Lucre - tian conspectus of life and death .

		Yet it is by no means certain that the excellences of his abound - ing verse make up for its limitations .

		Its metrical necessities have often stood in the way of clearness , and have , perhaps more than anything else , caused us to miss that justness and adequacy of expres - sion with which Lucretius so many times captures the mind and which prose translation has managed to set down .

		Pick at random one of the oft-quoted passages , such as the rendering of is a true test say that at the close of the third book lam iam non domus accipiet te laeta , , neque uxor ... Mr.
Leonard	PERSON	renders it : Thee now no more The joyful house and best of wives shall welcome , Nor little sons run up to snatch their kisses And touch with silent happiness thy heart , Thou shall not speed in undertakings more , Nor be the warder of thine own no more . ''

		Poor wretch , '' they say , '' one hostile hour hath ta'en Wretchedly from thee all life 's many guerdons , '' But add not , '' yet no longer unto thee Remains a remnant of desire for them . ''

		If this they only well perceived with mind And followed up with maxims , they would free Their state of man from anguish and from fear . ''

		O even as here thou art , aslumber in death , So shalt thou slumber down the rest of time , Released from every harrowing pang .

		But we , We have bewept thee with insatiate woe , Standing aside whilst in the awful pyre Thou wert made ashes ; and no day shall take For us the eternal sorrow from the breast . ''

		But ask the mourner what 's the bitterness That man should waste in an eternal grief , If , after all , the thing 's but sleep and rest ?

		and set it beside this prose of
Mackail	ORGANIZATION	's : Now no more shall a glad home and a true wife wel - come thee , nor darling children race to snatch thy first THE DIAL
April 19	DATE	kisses and touch thy heart with a sweet and silent con - tent ; no more mayest thou be prosperous in thy doings and a defense to thine own ; `` alas and woe ! ''

		say they , '' one disastrous day has taken all these prizes of thy life away from thee , '' but thereat they do not add this , '' and now no more does any longing for these things beset thee . ''

		This did their thought but clearly see and their speech follow , they would release themselves from great heart - ache and fear . ''

		Thou , indeed , as thou art sunk in the sleep of death , wilt so be for the rest of the ages , severed from all weary pains ; but we , while close by us thou didst turn ashen on the awful pyre , made unappeasable lament - ation , and everlastingly shall time never rid our heart of anguish . ''

		Ask we then this of him , what there is that is so very bitter , if sleep and peace be the conclusion of the matter , to make one fade away in never-ending grief ?

		Beside this , Mr.
Leonard	PERSON	's verse gives one a sense , not altogether correct , of literalness without ac - curacy , of passion without elevation , of clamor .

		Mackail 's key is too subdued for
Lucretius	PERSON	, as
Leonard	ORGANIZATION	's is too strident .

		Both miss the Lucretian poignancy , that eager deliberation and passionate quietude of his verse , which render it so truly the voice of his vision .

		But such is the fate of translators anywhere .

		The marvel is rather that they should at all , in Mr.
Leonard	PERSON	's suggestive analogy , have re-enacted any - thing of their original 's being and have caused it to live in the new body they have given it .

		With
Lucretius	PERSON	this is particularly difficult , so spiritual and uncustomary a thing is his vision .

		An almost unknown poet , of a despised philosophic sect , with a courage about ultimacies men hate each other for , his one poem passed , preserved by a single manu - script , down the Christian ages , with a stigma upon its worth and the life of its author at the hands of a sainted chronicler of a Christian church .

		Dante does not mention him , nor does he figure noticeably in the thoughts of men until the imaginings of philosophers have become the truths of science , and the face of the world has had stripped away the mask which the
Church	ORGANIZATION	had drawn over it .

		Since then his lovers have become myriads , but his temper has remained essentially alien to our Christian times .

		Why , may be gathered from what the strip - ping revealed .

		It was , by and large , that which
Lucretius	PERSON	had seen a universe of atoms and space , bound by inexorable law in a single process of alternate integration and dissolution ; of worlds made and unmade under the alternate sway of Venus and Mars , poetic personifications of two forces , really the flow and the ebb of the one cosmic tide which is existence .

		Foam and spindrift of this tide , man shares its character and destiny .

		The Nature which breeds him destroys him also , and all his life is a battle with death .

		Indeed , the love of life and the fear of death are in him one and the same thing .

		They make his pieties , his patriotism , his acquisitiveness , his ambition , and his love .

		They drive him from the kindliness and simplicity of elemental living to the cruelties , the complexities , the wars , the enslave - ments , and the other inhumanities men call civiliza - tion .

		They drive and compel him because he is ignorant of their nature and of his own powers and limitations .

		Let him learn to know them , and he is set free of them .

		He sees them then in their true measure and proportion , incidents in the effec - tuation of inexorable law ; his mind identifies itself with this law , his love of life relaxes , and when his love of life relaxes , the fear of death falls away .

		For the fear of death is the greatest of all fears , the ruling passion in the life of the sons of man , the energy of all the tragedies men inflict upon each other .

		Yet it rests upon ignorance and upon illusion .

		The fear of death is the fear of nothing ; the fear merely of the sleep and peace which are `` the conclusion of the matter . ''

		The fear of death , in a word , is the instinct toward living , against which argument can not prevail .

		Its follies and absurdities may be exposed , its foundation laid bare , and its setting discovered , and that is all .

		Once this is done , however , as Epicurus has done it , the intensities of life are weakened ; the spirit has changed its role from actor to spectator .

		It is free and at rest above the battle , serene and self - sufficient .

		... nought There is more goodly than to hold the high Serene plateaus , well fortressed by the wise , Whence thou may ` st look below on other men And see them ev'ry where wand ` ring , all dispersed In their lone seeking for the road of life ; Rivals in genius , or emulous in rank , Pressing through days and nights with hugest toil For summits of power and mastery of the world . ''

		This is , of course , essentially asceticism .

		But it has nothing in it of the asceticism of tradition .

		No medieval skeleton , with memento mori upon its lips .

		No mortification of the true normalities of life .

		It is a withdrawal rather of the mind 's attention to the ardent indifferences , the dynamic im - partialities of a Nature to which living and dying are all one : `` Nature for herself harks after noth - ing . ''

		It is the antipodes of Stoicism , for the Stoic accepts everything , and this is a great rejection .

		It is the antipodes of Christianity because to Christian materialism death is the gate to hell or paradise , and its memento mori is a minatory warning of a world to come .

		To Lucretius and the purer
Epi	ORGANIZATION	- curean tradition death is a thing not to be remem - bered but , because of its very inevitability , to be disregarded .

		A mind contemplative of
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's eternal laws is a free mind .

		It accepts its span of selfhood for its period and its proper worth , and when it ends , it ends .

		The rest is silence .


H. M. KALLEN	PERSON	.

		19 * 9 THE DIAL
London	LOCATION	,
February 20	DATE	1-rtFE IN
LONDON	LOCATION	HAS BEEN rather flat during the past month .

		I judge this from the fact that we are all inclined to buzz a little about the elec - tion of Sir Aston
Webb	PERSON	to the Presidency of the
Royal Academy	ORGANIZATION	.

		Sir Aston is the first architect who has ever received this distinction ; and , what - ever may have been the motives which the electors imagined as persuading them , I assume that the cosmic purpose in the matter was to assure us that the
Royal Academy	ORGANIZATION	was as dead as architecture or that architecture was as dead as the
Royal Academy	ORGANIZATION	it does not much matter which .

		Several painters of the modern school have raised a yelp of protest .

		Apparently they were still hoping that the
Academy	ORGANIZATION	might earn their approval by electing Mr.
Sargent	PERSON	.

		If an architect must be elected , they said , why not
Lutyens	PERSON	, who is a good and progressive architect ?

		But the
Academy	ORGANIZATION	goes its own way without refer - ence to the modern school .

		It chose the man most representative of its own spirit the man who de - signed the
Victoria Memorial	ORGANIZATION	and refronted Buck - ingham Palace , a man who knows what is expected of an eminent architect and who invariably fulfills expectations .

		The correct attitude in the affair was observed by the Academy itself and by Mr.
Jacob Epstein	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Epstein	PERSON	, being questioned , replied that he had nothing to say , that the Academy was a business house and had no connection with art , and that he had , therefore , no concern with its proceedings .

		It seems to me quite clear that the younger artists who ostentatiously decline to have any dealings with the Academy are a little ridicu - lous when they betray a benevolent interest in the choice of ` its President .

		But young painte ` rs in re - volt always tend to be a little ridiculous .

		Mean - while the
Academy	ORGANIZATION	is inviting the laughter of man - kind by discussing the proposition that Academicians shall retire at the age of seventy-five .

		Another event of interest is the appearance of the first pages of a new serial by Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	.

		The history of this writer 's reputation is one of the curiosities of modern literature .

		He has been `` be - fore the public , '' I suppose , for more than twenty years , and almost from his first book his reputation was assured with all the mighty persons whose opinions count .

		He combined , moreover , a fine creative imagination and an exquisite ^ prose style with a choice of characters , incidents , and settings that would have made the fortune of a writer of `` penny bloods . ''

		Nevertheless , he proved to be a delight only for the few ; and , as time went on , it seemed to be obvious that he must be content with the admiration of men of letters , and particularly of novelists , and with the certainty of enduring fame .

		These are not despicable rewards ; but some fortunate writers manage to add to them others of a more physically satisfying character .

		In
1912	DATE	or
1913	DATE	, however , a Civil List pension was granted to Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	, a grant which does not usually come the way of the `` best seller . ''

		Then at the end of
1913	DATE	, or the beginning of
1914	DATE	, he pub - lished Chance , and suddenly the scene was changed .

		I suppose the idea that Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	was a great novelist had been slowly germinating for years in the breasts of the persons who really sell novels ; and at this opportunity it burgeoned forth .

		The newspapers were filled with immense reviews , the book 's name was on everyone 's lips you know what I mean when I say `` everyone '' and several editions were printed .

		Now , Chance , though a fine book , is not in my judgment Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	's best ; but since its appearance he has been a popular , as well as a famous , novelist .

		He is not , if I esti - mate his character correctly from his writings , much moved by the change .

		It is an event which will rejoice his colleagues more than himself ; but in years of doubt and depression it is an event which rejoices his colleagues very considerably .

		A little while ago I referred to the probability that the old wearisome discussions about the Higher Drama would be revived with the end of the war .

		Now I am told that the Higher Drama is in for a very bad time indeed .

		- This is due to two facts .

		In the first place , Western theaters have grown so exceedingly costly that only a syndicate , and a very wealthy syndicate at that , can possibly hope to undertake the risks involved in leasing them .

		In the second place , two such syndicates have arisen and are gradually swallowing up theater after theater .

		The old actor-manager , whose demand for a place a permanent place in the limelight used so much to irritate the exponents of the
Higher Drama	ORGANIZATION	, has already almost disappeared ; and the Higher Dramatists are beginning to miss him .

		He was , they say , a creature of strange tastes and methods and preposterous vanities ; but there was a strain of idealism in his character .

		He did not care wholly for loot , he cared something for artistic success and a good deal for his reputation .

		But the new syndicates are mere caterers , on the same level as the proprietors of multiple tea-shops .

		They will find out what the public is prepared to pay for , and they will give it precisely that , indifferent to any other qualities in the goods they handle .

		More - THE DIAL
April 19	DATE	over , it is obvious that the more theaters the syndi - cates control , the more secure they will be against the chances and misfortunes that commonly assail theatrical enterprises .

		The Higher Dramatists do not look for much help from the syndicates , and they are in consequence very unhappy .

		But I can see two possible mitigations of the < loom they anticipate .

		The greater the success of the syndicates the more powerful is likely to be the inevitable reaction against it ; and I can see that reaction taking the shape of a
National Theater	ORGANIZATION	in
London	LOCATION	, and numerous and enterprising municipal theaters in the provinces .

		The theater is , in all conscience , bad enough ; and , perhaps , it must be worse before it can be better .

		On the other hand , it does seem to me possible that unity of control may involve greater diversity of production .

		At present what happens is this : a manager makes a hit with a farce containing a slightly risque scene in a bathroom ; and promptly every other manager in
London	LOCATION	rushes on to the stage a new farce also containing a scene in a bathroom .

		But the syndi - cate , when it makes a hit of this kind , will not , if I may so express myself , put all its eggs in one bath - room .

		It will find it more profitable to reserve certain theaters for certain kinds of plays , and so tap all sections of the public at once .

		Thus the
Higher Drama	ORGANIZATION	, which really has a following , if not a large one , will get its innings after all .

		And I am persuaded that the public which will pay to witness artistically serious drama is larger than anyone has yet been able to demonstrate .

		The public was never enthusiastic about the gloomier plays of Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	and his followers it had no great interest in tragic seductions in the country ; the darkness of life in the industrial districts failed to stir its blood .

		But , though you would not gather it from hearing the Higher Dramatists talk , these genres do not really exhaust all the possibilities .

		It is not a fact , as is often believed , that the public dislikes a thing to be good .

		The public dislikes in - tensely to be bored ; and it sometimes finds good art so difficult to follow as to be boring .

		But a thing is not necessarily good art because it bores the pub - lic .

		The gloomier works of the Higher Dramatists attracted nobody but a few persons desirous of ap - pearing intellectual .

		The public were repelled by the dullness of the stuff , and persons of taste were repelled simply because it was not good art .

		But I can see , if only faintly , a type of play that we shall all equally like and respect ; and that type of play , I dare to affirm , is the play in verse .

		The public , though it has had few recent opportunities of finding it out , likes good verse well spoken .

		It is at present immensely enjoying a production of
Twelfth Night	ORGANIZATION	, which is particularly distinguished by the beautiful elocution of some of the perform - ers .

		The Elizabethan drama sprang out of this public appetite ; if enough of our young poets will turn their attention to the stage and make up their minds to try and to fail and to keep on trying , they may stimulate this appetite anew .


Stephen Phillips	PERSON	succeeded ; but he was not good enough either as a poet or as a dramatist for his success to last ; and practically all the other poetic dramatists of recent times have been well intentioned , and sometimes excellent , poets without the slightest notion how to work on an audience .

		I suppose really that - I am the only person in
London	LOCATION	who looks on the pros - pects of the Higher Drama with a cheerful eye .

		The exponents of it do not , nor do those who have witnessed its performances .

		EDWARD SHANKS .

		/ Watch One Woman Knitting The lamplight rings her in a golden space , And isles her in from all the eager dark ; She can not see me where I sit and mark The disappearing pageant on her face : Those swiftest thoughts , and moods , and whims like lace , Impermanent as winds across the grass One after one they rise and change and pass , One after one , and leave no slightest trace .

		Her 's is the peace of a cathedral close .

		The lamp 's warm glow has walled her all about In deepest quiet from the world without Until I can not think how well she knows That just beyond this circle where she sits , They clash and curse and die , for whom she knits .

		DAVID
MORTON	PERSON	.

		THE DIAL
GEORGE DONLIN JOHN DEWEY ROBERT MORSS LOVETT	PERSON	, Editor In Charge of the Reconstruction Program :
THORSTEIN VEBLEN CLARENCE BRITTEN HELEN MAROT	PERSON	AN NO DEPARTMENT OF THE MODERN WORLD HAS the tendency toward democracy been more pro- nounced than in education .

		An analysis of the process into its factors clearly shows the change from the Renaissance to the modern school .

		These factors are three the subject matter , the teacher , and the pupil .

		In respect to each the education of the Renaissance was aristocratic .

		The subject mat - ter was conventionally prescribed , a group of classics whose value was a matter of authority , not of ex - perience .

		The teaching was autocratic ; the posses - sion of the text in a dead language gave the teacher an absolute control over his pupils .

		The fact that the subject matter was remote from the immediate needs and interests of ordinary existence automatically restricted its followers to a special caste .

		Culture was the concern of an institution it was academic , as religion was ecclesiastic .

		The appearance of
Comenius	ORGANIZATION	, almost contemporary with that of
Bacon	PERSON	and the scientific Renaissance , marked the beginning of the modern tendency ; the exclusion of purely conventional learning , the use of the vernacular , the introduction of an objective method , above all the concept of a school system which should extend education to the people these ideas projected by the seventeenth century reformer are gradually being achieved .

		In the last few years the progress has been notable .

		No longer is the teacher an autocrat .

		From the earliest experimental school to the univer - sity seminar the teacher works with his classes in a spirit of cooperation .

		No longer is the subject matter prescribed , conventional , remote from life .

		The defense of the study of the so-called classics is now based on their vital quality as a record of ex - perience .

		Practical study of the world , technical study of the arts are part of every curriculum .

		In method , experiment has replaced authority .

		These changes in subject matter and method have made education necessarily democratic in appeal .

		It has become an initiation into life of which all men feel the need , and resent the lack for themselves and their children .

		But in this triumphant movement of education in the direction of democracy there is One point of friction .

		It is the point at which the system of education is in contact with that of society and government .

		The control of education by persons outside the system , of endowed universities and col - leges by trustees , of state institutions and public schools by regents and school boards , results in a limitation of its natural democratic tendencies .

		In the direction of subject matter political have taken the place of literary or religious conventions .

		A conventional political economy , political science , and history have been imposed , and any attempt by the teacher or the pupil to break through this shell and touch the core of human experience within is bitterly resented by those who represent the social control of vested interests .

		Similarly the method of experiment and testimony is ruled out as soon as it is applied * lo current political and social phenomena .

		The teacher is prevented from joining his pupils in a search for truth , but is compelled to resume his old papal seat of authority .

		Of all these types of limitation and impediment the relations of the
New York Board of Education	ORGANIZATION	with the teachers during the past year afford ample illustration .

		The in - fluence of war psychology was a natural and reason - able excuse for the attitude shown by the
Board	ORGANIZATION	and its superintendents while the country was at war , but it is significant that with the return to peace the feeling which was developed for nationalistic purposes has been transferred to social ends .

		In - stead of
Germany	LOCATION	,
Russia	LOCATION	is the object of patriotic animadversion .

		The investigations and trials of teachers held by the
Board of Education	ORGANIZATION	are pitiful spectacles .

		On the one hand is the teacher , ac - cused of something which in most cases amounts to making personal reservations of opinion in regard to the phenomena of the world instead of enforcing arbitrarily the official view , and of inviting his pupils to make use of the method of experiment and testimony .

		On the other hand there is the organi - zation , aided by the officious zeal of its servants to whom the espionage habit has become second nature .

		Between them stands a flock of pupils , their minds driven this way and that by examination and cross - examination , victims of the war as certainly as if they had been drafted and sent to the front .

		It is nothing short of sabotage of education .

		Similar re - ports come from
Washington	LOCATION	where a teacher , ex - pressing the opinion that '' the Soviet Government in
Russia	LOCATION	was better for
Russia	LOCATION	than was the ab - solutism of the Czar '' was charged with '' unpatri - otic utterances '' and suspended .

		The superintendent has barred discussion of the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	to - gether with Bolshevism , in spite of the fact that the 420 THE DIAL
April 19	DATE	teaching of current topics is required , and it is a literal impossibility to exclude these subjects from discussion in classes in modern history and eco - nomics .

		The remedy for this maladjustment is immediate and obvious .

		It is simply to give teachers control of education , to restrict the functions of school boards and trustees to business management .

		It is to be noted that this is the demand everywhere of labor that respects itself responsibility for produc - tion .

		Responsibility is the only way of introducing that esprit de corps which has been defined as con - sisting in thinking in terms of the enterprise rather than of the job .

		It is characteristic of workers that under a system of responsibility they make few mis - takes in choosing their leaders men and women of initiative and originality .

		But the true analogy is not between teachers and labor , but between educa - tion and other professions .

		To quote Dr.
Kallen	PERSON	-LRB- THE DIAL ,
Feb. 28 , 1918	DATE	-RRB- : `` To the discoverers and creators of Knowledge , and to its transmitters and distributors , to these and to no one else beside belongs the control of education .

		It is as absurd that any but teachers and investigators should gov - 4 ern the art of education as that any but medical practitioners and investigators should govern the art of medicine . ''

		I T IS CLEAR THAT ANY COVENANT OF PEACE among nations will depend for its validity upon the activity of its supporters in all countries in taking ad - vantage of the opportunity offered for international cooperation to remove the causes of war .

		No one need be told
today	DATE	that of these causes armament and military training are two of the most immediate .

		It is not too much to say that every country may test its will to end war by its readiness to disarm , and the weakness of this will is revealed by the feeble and uncertain character of the provisions of the Covenant in this matter .

		There is all the more reason , therefore , that believers in international peace should manifest their faith by national action .

		The principle is recognized by the Covenant of armament graduated according to the geographical circumstances of the contracting parties .

		Clearly the part is suggested to the
United States	LOCATION	of lead - ing the way in showing confidence in reason and good will instead of bayonets and iron-clads .

		And the part should not be a difficult one .

		The people of the
United States	LOCATION	are normally pacific and they have had enough experience of the spiritual rav - ages of war to recognize the symptoms of the dis - ease .

		They have never built the system of general military service into their social structure , or crowned the edifice with a military caste .

		The re - sult of the recent mobilization seems on the whole to have given the people a pronounced distaste for military experience , and this distaste is apparently strongest among those who participated most ac - tively in that experience .

		At the same time it is clear that no merely passive attitude on the part of a people will stand against powerful forces working to subvert it , and a democratically organ - ized people is peculiarly liable to attack by such forces through the institution of representative government .

		It seems probable that the issue of universal military service will appear well to the front in the next presidential campaign , and mean - while the sponsors for it are active in the various states .

		In these the method is to make military training a part of the high school course , and the question thus becomes an educational one .

		A law to this effect , in
New York	LOCATION	, hastily conceived and irregularly enforced , is now undergoing scrutiny as to its educational value .

		Similar bills are pend - ing in the legislatures of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	,
Missouri	LOCATION	, and
California	LOCATION	.

		In
Oregon	LOCATION	such a bill has failed ; in
New Jersey	LOCATION	the adverse report of the legislative committee on military drill in high schools has probably proved decisive .

		The organizations which for one purpose or another are seeking to carry such bills in the several states , as the basis of a plan of national military service , have placed the question squarely on educational grounds .

		The
Security League	ORGANIZATION	sent its most brilliant orator to the last meeting of
the National Education Association	ORGANIZATION	to clamor for its endorsement .

		It is altogether proper that the opinion of teachers should be decisive on this phase of the matter .

		If teachers have little influence with local authorities in which control of education is specifically vested , at least they have the power of organized citizens to secure political action which shall be representative of the com - munity , and of themselves , in a matter on which they have a supreme right to be heard .

		TH , HE VICTORY LOAN SHOULD BE THE OCCASION for the exhibition of a new spirit if
the League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	is to be worth the paper on which it is drawn up .

		The Liberty Bonds were sold largely on hate .

		The appeal carried to the ear of the people by four-minute oratory , or to the eye of the people by posters and moving-pictures , was sup - ported by lavish representations of the malevolence of the enemy .

		That these were in part false was indicated by the action of General Pershing in with - drawing from active salesmanship a sergeant who was telling atrocity stories unwarranted by any - thing in the actual experience of the troops .

		At the same time this popular feeling was used as a measure of coercion against citizens who did not manifest the degree of financial patriotism demanded by the standards of the community .

		The Secretary of the
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	fulminated against pacifists .

		The extent to which organized coercion was practiced under the direction of local managers is revealed in an article in The New Republic for
March 29	DATE	, enitled Bor - rowing with a Club .

		It is hardly necessary to point
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 421 out that such methods , emphasizing division in pub - lic opinion , will not serve to advance the prospects of the present loan .

		The government has been un - able to secure , so far as we know , the punishment of a single person for illegal proceedings in connec - tion with the sale of Liberty Bonds .

		It is not to be expected that it will be able to mark its disapproval of their ' methods by relieving these active patriots from the management of the present loan .

		As in the case of leaders and inciters of mob violence , the energy and aggressiveness shown by such persons are qualities with which the government will hesi - tate to dispense .

		But the spirit and method of their appeal must be totally different if the distinction between the Liberty Loans and the Victory Loan is to be maintained .

		The victory , which is properly to be celebrated by new sacrifices , was a victory won for the whole world .

		The fruits of that vic - tory are to be found in a reunion of the world toward which nothing can contribute so much at the present time as the feeding of the starving , the clothing of the naked , wherever they may be , among our late enemies as among our allies .

		Is it too much to suggest emphasis upon this generous aspect of the sacrifice ?

		The victory was won for democ - racy at home as well as abroad .

		The fruits of that victory are to be found in a reunion of Americans on the basis of their freedom , toward which re - union nothing can contribute so much at the present time as the release of those in prison for conscience ' or opinion 's sake .

		In many cases a re - calcitrant attitude toward the Liberty Loans was one of the indictments brought against those con - victed under the Espionage Act .

		To what extent this attitude was engendered and reenforced by the illegal methods of the managers of the loans is a matter deserving honest inquiry .

		The withholding of supply has been a time-honored weapon by which the Anglo-Saxons have maintained their liberties , and to some citizens the Liberty Loans were doubt - less presented as a form of taxation , as unjust and illegal as Ship Money or the Stamp Tax .

		The government could manifest the spirit of victory and confidence in the results of the war in no way more eloquently than by opening the drive for a Victory Loan by a general amnesty to all victims of laws en - acted for the emergency of war .

		A HE UNIVERSITY PROMISES TO BE THE LAST citadel of sex privilege .

		The granddaughters of the women who won from prejudice the opportunity to study in college on equal terms with men have yet to secure the same opportunity in the better pro- fessional schools .

		During most of these years , more - over , the public , and many of the private , colleges have been conferring degrees on women , admitting them to the ' * fellowship of educated men '' the fellowship , but not the profession .

		For though their scholarship carry the academic seal of approval and their record show the full apprenticeship exacted by an ancient and jealous guild , they have not yet except here and there , and in inconsiderable num - bers the opportunity to teach on equal terms with men .

		They may clerk in libraries , drudge in ad - ministrative offices , mark themes , correct exercises , and aspire to infrequent instructorships ; but ex - cept here and there , and in inconsiderable numbers they may not enter the faculty proper and achieve the rewards , niggardly enough , that men finally re - ceive for the apprentice years of overwork and underpay .

		Before the war this situation was an anachronism :
today	DATE	, when women have convinced the world of their capacity to perform nearly all tasks that men perform , it is becoming a peril .

		Attracted by the current demand in other fields , with better wages and nearer approximation to sex equality , large numbers of the more independent -LRB- and by the same sign more valuable -RRB- women are being drawn away from academic life .

		If the colleges find it difficult to retain the services of men of initiative , how can they hope to keep their women teachers unless they level the humiliating and indefensible barrier of sex discrimination ?

		There is a certain type of academic mind that professes indifference to the breaches made in university personnel by the greater attractiveness of secular pursuits .

		It finds something unworthy in the teacher who is swayed at all by considerations of wage or working hours .

		But it is a mind that is increasingly incongruous in the world for which our colleges are preparing our youth .

		Sooner or later it must give way before modern demands , just as sooner or later the col - leges must accept the modern world 's estimate of women 's sphere .

		But will it be so late that we shall yet witness the spectacle of educators arguing before women legislators that woman 's place is in the home ?

		UNDER THE ACID TEST OF EVERYDAY PSYCHOLOGY our pedagogy still shows a considerable blind-spot .

		One of the minor evidences of its existence is the prevailing practice of writing two distinct prefaces or `` forewords '' in our high school and collegiate textbooks one labeled To the Teacher , and the other To the Pupil .

		To the discerning student this bifocal adjustment is apt to appear in the nature of an implied condescension .

		It is like com - ing to the branching of a road , with one fork winding upward to the instructor and the < other sloping slightly down grade for the assumed mental convenience of the student .

		With a modicum of ingenuity it ought to be possible for the author of a textbook to merge these separate messages to start with a salutary `` meeting of the minds '' of teacher and pupil and thus pave the way for a more unified approach to the stuff of his ensuing chapters .

		The innovation would certainly be more adroit and therefore better psychology .

		422 THE DIAL
April 19	DATE	Foreign Comment THE SOVIETS AND THE SCHOOLS An editorial on Americanism and Bolshevism ap - peared in the
Chicago Daily Tribune	ORGANIZATION	on
February 6	DATE	.

		The whole of it shows how poorly informed the editors are on Russian affairs .

		I was especially astounded by the following passage : `` We build schoolhouses .

		The Bolsheviki shoot school teachers .

		The school teachers know too much . ''

		In reality , the first order of the Soviet power which reached the villages in
November , 1917	DATE	, was a decree for the increase of the salaries of village teachers almost fourfold .

		Further orders of the Soviet power abolished directors and inspectors of public schools those Czarist agents of public '' un - enlightenment '' who have through some misunder - standing survived the Provisional Governments .

		In their places elected Soviets of People 's Education were organized in every county .

		And finally , on
August 26 , 1918	DATE	, an All-Russian Convention on Education was called in
Moscow	LOCATION	.

		When opening this convention the
Commissar of People 's Educa	ORGANIZATION	- tion ,
Lunacharsky	LOCATION	, thus characterized the problems '' of the
Government	ORGANIZATION	in regard to schools : The revolution of
October 25	DATE	-LSB-
November 7	DATE	-RSB- made the school problem one of the most important problems .

		The struggle of the people is carried on in three directions : -LRB- 1 -RRB- for state power , -LRB- 2 -RRB- for economic power , -LRB- 3 -RRB- for knowledge ... Never was the work on this planet as fruitful as that of the past ten months .

		The same with the school .

		The people can not direct the economy and the life of the country if they are not educated .

		The school is subject to revolutionary reforms .

		It must not be built anew , it must only be rebuilt radically ... We want the maximum development of the schools .

		The wish of the present power is to give greater and better educational opportunities ... It is already possible to work more normally .

		We have not passed the danger yet ; the military struggle is still on , but this period is comparatively normal and there is a possibility of get - ting to work in the rear .

		The Commissariat is almost complete ; the pedagogues are with us and the school reform must be realized this year .

		What does this reform consist of ?

		In spite of the opinion of the
Chicago Daily Tribune	ORGANIZATION	it consists of nothing more than the Americanization of the Rus - sian schools .

		The American schools are undoubtedly the best and Free
Russia	LOCATION	makes great use of .

		this ex - periment .

		At the present time the following has already been accomplished : -LRB- 1 -RRB- The schools have been taken out of the hands of the clergy and religion as a compulsory sub - ject has been abolished .

		-LRB- 2 -RRB- All schools are free .

		-LRB- 3 -RRB- Coeducation of boys and girls has been intro - duced in all schools .

		-LRB- 4 -RRB- The participation of the pupils in some school affairs is permitted -LRB- school republics -RRB- .

		But the main reform of the Russian schools con - sists of the ` creation of a continuous school system , which was in the process of creation already in No - vember , as one may judge by copies of Russian news - papers which came to hand .

		To an American who always had a continuous school system this reform is not quite clear , for it is difficult for him to picture the Russian schools as they were during the Czar 's regime .

		Until the very outbreak of the revolution the Russian statutes divided the Russian '' subjects '' into two classes : the privileged -LRB- 3 per cent -RRB- , and the tax-paying -LRB- 97 per cent -RRB- .

		For each of these classes there were separate schools .

		For the former there were gymnasiums -LRB- high schools -RRB- , universi - ties , and polytechnical institutes ; for the latter , vil - lage and city schools .

		The completion of a course in these schools did not give the pupil the right to enter high school .

		Furthermore , the admission of children of tax-paying '' subjects '' was prohibited altogether in some high schools .

		And those who , , according to the law , had the right to enter high schools were deprived of this right by all sorts of circulars of the Czar 's ministers , who recommended the directors not to heed this right .

		By a continuous school system w r e mean the right of the pupil , who has been graduated from grammar school city or village to enter high school and after that a university or a polytechnical institute .

		This reform involves the increase of the number of high schools and the revision of the program of the grammar schools .

		It is also worth while to say a few words about this latter program under the old regime .

		The city schools with a six-year course and the zemsky vil - lage schools with a three-year course were compara - tively good , although even there much time was de - voted to the memorizing of prayers and of all titles not only of the Czar , but of his seventy relatives as well .

		But the zemsky schools have long since been looked upon suspiciously because of their liberal ten - dency , and they were being replaced therefore by church schools .

		The latter had the largest number of pupils .

		Some of these schools had a one-year course , others , a two-year course .

		Most attention in these was paid to choir singing and to the memo - rizing of prayers .

		Reading was taught in such a way '' that the reader should not understand what he reads . ''

		You will no doubt think that this is a joke .

		But no , this is a quotation from one of the secret instructions of the Holy Synod to the prelates .

		Such a state of affairs was quite natural under the autocratic regime .

		No wonder that its ideologist and inspirer ,
Pobiedonoszeff	LOCATION	, said : '' Especially do we fear popular education . ''

		But it is an enigma to me why both Provisional Governments overlooked the school problem .

		Perhaps the fault lies in the per - sonality of the cadet Minister of Education , whom even Boublikoff calls '' absurd '' in his book entitled The Russian Revolution .

		1919 THE DIAL 423 Communications A NOBLE TRANSLATION SIR : Yesterday was one of those golden days that have been so unusually numerous this extraordi -
nary winter	DATE	.

		An accumulation of tasks kept my rebellious body at my desk but my mind was for - ever tramping the frozen fields .

		And when a great wedge of honking wild geese pushed north - ward over the housetops , even my body deserted .

		But at the door I met the postman with a package from THE DIAL , which was just enough to send me sneaking back to duty .

		I spare you any account of the pleasantries I in - dulged in at the expense of the editor who had thus tripped up adventure .

		My animus all came to this : What were you thinking of to send me another book t to review ?

		Did n't you know that I was already hopelessly buried under other unfinished work ?

		You should have the package back unopened .

		You should be told , politely but firmly , to go hang .

		Alas , curiosity !

		There could be no harm in just looking to see what the book was .

		Perhaps I might even want to read a little of it .

		I could easily enough wrap it up again , and still tell you go hang which , after all , was the important thing .

		But once having seen the familiar and magnificent head of the author on the wrapper , the book was mine mine by the divine right of appreciation .

		Why , sir , I have lived with that work for years .

		As Professor
Kerr	PERSON	has issued , book by book , his translation of Plato 's Republic , I have read and reread the immortal dis - cussion .

		All my favorite hilltops and glens and lake - retreats know
Socrates	PERSON	and Glaucon and
Adejman	PERSON	- tus and Thrasymachus .

		I have had them debate in villages before audiences gathered about that great American institution , the base-burner ; in towns by the glow of the hospitable open fire ; in cities when the reader 's tremulo had to be reduced by a seat on the radiator .

		These little booklets , now worn and soiled from much traveling in knapsacks , have short - ened the hours of illness , have kept alive the hope of a better social order , have encouraged philosophic temper and imaginative identification with alien times and alien creeds .

		No , you shall not have back the volume which now gathers them together in durable , well printed form .

		Instead I send you two words about it , or rather one about the book and one about the author .

		Of course there are other good translations of
The Republic	ORGANIZATION	.

		Professor
Kerr	PERSON	's work excels in the clear - ness , strength , and limpid flow of his style .

		He has assimilated the Platonic diction and movement .

		The translation is agreed to be impeccable in accu - racy , and it is colored all through by a wide acquaint - ance with the scholarly queries and cruxes pertain - ing to the subject .

		But the striking quality of the achievement is the absence of all academic flavor .

		One carries away the impression of having engaged with real people in an actual discussion of living is - sues .

		And this gives the book great and permanent value for intelligent readers everywhere .

		The translation has an additional value however for those who know the circumstances of its creation .

		For it represents the dedicated labor of years on the part of a man who had not only retired after long and honorable service at the
University of Wiscon	ORGANIZATION	- sin , but who had reached a period of life when all but the rarest spirits consider themselves out of the race .

		Indeed the last third of the translation , accom - plished after the author was over eighty-five and practically blind , was done by ear and dictation .

		The fact that in spite of this the freshness and clarity of style and the accuracy of scholarship are maintained to the end , so that it is quite impossible to discover any weakening of powers , to say nothing of detecting where the blindness set in , demonstrates the author 's extraordinary physical and intellectual vigor .

		Those acquainted with the book were not surprised at the tribute recently paid in a speech at the
Madison Literary Club	ORGANIZATION	, by
Chief Justice Winslow	ORGANIZATION	, himself a scholar , to the fine quality of the work and the fine courage of the action .

Newton A. Fuessle	ORGANIZATION	.


Mof	ORGANIZATION	- fat , Yard .

		In computing the damages inflicted by
Germany	LOCATION	during the war , the transformation of sound lit - erary materials into the '' timely '' propagandist nonsense of The Flail should doubtless be taken into .

		account .

		Before the Hun gave Mr.
Fuessle	PERSON	strabismus he had recorded in his sharp , unsmiling way the realities of lower middle-class adolescence in the backwaters of
Chicago	LOCATION	, of business enterprise on
LaSalle Street	ORGANIZATION	, and of the forced and furtive dissipations that ran below the surface of life at
the University	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the transition from the timid , dreaming public-school boy to the successful man of business the author had the opportunity to show how the demands of contemporary business tech - nique may develop a personality whose native endowments run to softness and sentimentalism , into the triumphant , self-assertive model of the Economic Man .

		However well Mr.
Fuessle	PERSON	's ob - servation had provided him with the details of such a novel , his psychology was not sensitive enough , nor his humor keen enough , to grasp the possibili - ties of a realistic criticism of life .

		Lacking insight into
Rudolph Dohmer	PERSON	, his hero , as an individual , the author falls back upon his hero 's ancestors ; and since his squalid and embittered parents happen to be of German stock , every bit of theft , rapine , ruth - lessness , and lack of principle that
Rudolph	PERSON	shows is fastened extenuatingly upon his hateful forbears .

		Thus the interesting exploration of a new social milieu is makeshifted into an excursion into the realms of quack anthropology and quack social psychology for the purpose of raising the question of alleged pertinence during the period of recon - struction : '' Is it
Rudolph Dohmer	PERSON	's power to sub - merge through American association and American ideals the hereditary instincts of the German ? ''

		It is this warped mirror of pseudoscience which '' Mr.
Fuessle	PERSON	holds up to life , and the consequence is a systematic perversion of values and a distortion of images .

		That there is any distinction between the racial inheritance common to all
Western Euro	ORGANIZATION	- peans and the cultural heritage peculiar to a region or to a technology , the author simply does not grasp .

		Whenever the results of the American milieu be - come a little too painful for candid appraisal , his defense reaction is to vapor murkily about the Hun in
Rudolph	LOCATION	.

		The Hun is the scapegoat upon which the sins of the American business regime are fas - tened .

		Unfortunately for this comforting thesis ,
Nesseth	PERSON	and Stone and
Shattuck	PERSON	, the advertising strategists whose habits of masterly chicane Ru - dolph successfully acquires , are not tainted Teu - tons , but patriotic , liberty-loaning , dyed-in-the-wool Americans .

		What pushes
Rudolph	PERSON	forward in his career is not that he is by accident a Hun , but by accident a human being .

		The saddest commentary upon this drastic exposure of the terrible handicap of an alien Prussian ancestry is that the most genial character in The Flail is the rough old unlettered peasant ,
Biltmeier	PERSON	, who without palter - ing lends the hero a thousand dollars for his college tuition .

		Where American associations and
Ameri	PERSON	- can ideals are set forth , on the contrary , they do not come out very creditably , and the reader is led impiously to question whether the white napery of middle-class reputability , the liveried coaches on
Dearborn Avenue	LOCATION	, and the gaudy delicacies of the cabaret are very potent elements in conveying to the unassimilated foreigner the qualities of that traditional ideal of
America	LOCATION	that one associates with
Jefferson	PERSON	,
Paine	PERSON	,
Walt Whitman	PERSON	, and
Lincoln	LOCATION	.

		An author who sets out to prove the putative virtues of our civilization in relation to a fictitious national problem ought to be able to stack the evidence more competently .

		THE VOCATIONAL EDUCATION OF GIRLS AND WOMEN .

		By

Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	.

		The suddenly increased interest in vocational ed - ucation , responding to the demand for training war - crippled soldiers , has brought this subject out of the field of academic discussion into the open of immed - iately practical policies .

		M. de Paeuw is Inspector General of primary education in
Belgium	LOCATION	and pedagogic inspector in the institutes for vocational re-education of wounded soldiers .

		His book gives an account of what Bel - gium , in spite of her upset condition , has accom - plished in vocational re-education since
1915	DATE	, and presents an object , lesson in what can be done when the state whole-heartedly stands behind an educa - tional project .

		The
Belgian National School for Maimed Soldiers	ORGANIZATION	at
Port-Villez	ORGANIZATION	includes courses of training with apprenticeship in forty-eight trades , an
Auxiliary School	ORGANIZATION	for assistants in commerce , trade , and administration , and an
Agricultural School	ORGANIZATION	.

		The apprenticeship system , through which pupils get their training in work on actual orders , secures an added value from the war-time shortage in pro- duction ; and the profit on these orders , which are chiefly for the state , reduces the cost of the training course .

		To secure the pupil 's best allround develop - ment the work is organized under three departments the medical , the pedagogic , and the technical .

		It is noteworthy that the time requisite for apprentice - ship in the trades proves to be much less than the time required under ordinary business conditions .

		Since the education of the pupil is the first considera - tion , his training follows a logical progression from one completed process to another , while the work produced is of merely incidental importance .

		It is unfortunate that the attitude of patronage char - acteristic of the French military mind in relation to

		426 THE DIAL
April 19	DATE	the workingman is so obvious in
M. de Pauew	ORGANIZATION	's dis - cussion .

		Nevertheless , as a report of work actually being done , the book has an immediate interest to advocates of vocational education in general .

		Mr.
Leake	PERSON	opens up in stimulating fashion the whole question of education in its relation to recon - struction .

		We seem gradually to have accepted the idea that after the war we are to have a reform in education as an essential element in the whole scheme of economic readjustment .

		For a number of years in disconnected situations we have been making ex - periments and trying our methods urged by one or another specialist seeking a scheme of education which would bridge the constantly widening gulf be - tween the academic methods of the school and the immediate attractions of industry .

		That so many children prefer to go to work at the end of the com - pulsory school period must be charged against the school , which has failed to take advantage of the spirit of restlessness of children at this age and their growing demand for independent expression .

		In our American environment , and in the particular indus - trial state in which we find ourselves , the '' motor - minded '' child who learns by doing things is pre - dominant , and the successful school will reckon with his needs and taste no less than with those of his studious-minded brother .

		We want a scheme of ed - ucation which shall recognize the industrial regime in which we live and cooperate with it without being dominated by it .

		We do not want our children , in Prussian fashion , assigned and trained to some form of industry which will turn them out skilled workers ' without consulting their individual inclinations or abilities .

		Neither do we want them put through a course of book knowledge unrelated to the world of work in which a large part of their lives will be spent .

		The schools must decide whether they will adapt themselves to the needs and taste of the child and so , hold him a few years longer , or will hand him over to industry .

		Raising the compulsory school age to sixteen years , it is true , will do much , and enforcing compulsory attendance will do more ; but neither method is a substitute for the sort of school which will appeal to the parent as too valuable , and to the child as too attractive , to give up for a few early dollars in industry .

		As inspector in the government service for the
Province of Ontario	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Leake	PERSON	has made a study of school conditions on the Continent , in
Great Britain	LOCATION	, and in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		His book is a report , authoritative but condensed , of the present state of women 's education for homemaking and in - dustrial pursuits , excluding the professional field .

		His treatment of homemaking as an industry , but still women 's chief industry , is entirely sound , and his analysis of the domestic-servant problem is illuminating .

		The book contains a harvest of well selected information that will be of special value to anyone who has been so busy digging in one corner of the field that he has lost perspective and needs to recover his view of the whole field .

		THE TRAGEDY OF TRAGEDIES ; or , The Life and
Death of Tom Thumb the Great	ORGANIZATION	, With the Annotations of H. Scriblcrus Secundus .

		By
Henry Fielding	PERSON	.

		Edited by
James T. Hill	PERSON	- house .


Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		We may speculate as to Fielding 's own emotions could he perceive the scholarly attention lavished upon his life and works in handsome volumes emanating recently from
New Haven	LOCATION	.

		In his Mod - ern Glossary Fielding makes '' Pedantry '' a syn - onym for '' Learning '' ; '' self-taught commentators '' are objects of his ridicule ; text editing and emenda - tions he satirizes more than once in the Covent Garden Journal and elsewhere .

		In his Journey from This World to the Next -LRB- published in
1743	DATE	-RRB- he lets Shakespeare announce the critical doctrine which is apparently Fielding 's own a doctrine bred of his scorn of the Shakespearean scholarship of
Rowe	PERSON	,
Theobald	PERSON	,
Warburton	PERSON	, et al : '' I marvel nothing so much as that men - will gird themselves at discovering obscure beauties in an author .

		Certes the greatest and most pregnant beauties are ever the plainest and most evidently striking ; and when two meanings of a passage can in the least balance our judg - ment which to prefer , I hold it matter of unuestionable certainty that neither of them is worth a farthing . ''

		So on turning to Mr.
Hillhouse	PERSON	's competent edi - tion of The Tragedy of Tragedies one is inevitably bound , despite his appreciation of the uses of the work , to imagine Fielding 's honest mirth could he behold his own burlesque of scholarly editing sol - emnly treated to preface and notes replete with parallel passages and editorial opinions , with dis - cussions of date and edition , of sources and imita - tions and altered versions .

		There seems , then , a humorous premonition in the concluding sentence to
H. Scriblerus Secundus	PERSON	' mock preface : I have a young Commentator from the
University	ORGANIZATION	, who is reading over all the modern Tragedies , at Five
Shill	PERSON	- ings a Dozen , and collecting all that they have stole from our Author , which shall shortly be added in an Ap - pendix to this Work .

		The Commentator in the present case however , besides reading many tragedies of the species Field - ing burlesqued and culling apt parallels for his notes , has set forth in initial chapters the complicated stage history of the play in its earlier and later versions , and of the interpolations and adaptations to which it was subjected .

		He expounds the nature of Field - ing 's burlesque of the heroic play a type of trag - edy still popular with the playgoers at that time , though discarded by the playwrights in favor of the classical play .

		In the mock critical preface and the burlesqued annotations of the longer version of the play , as he shows , Fielding attacks the critics for their mechanical application to tragedy of established rules , in justification of which they resort to the practice and precepts of the ancients .

		Mr.
Hill	PERSON	- house points out that in such attacks on Dennis ,
Theobald	PERSON	,
Bentley	LOCATION	, and other critics , Fielding was following the fashion set by Pope in the Dunciad ,

April 19	DATE	a work which together with the earlier satire on heroic plays , The Rehearsal , and an anonymous pamphlet entitled A Comment upon the
History of Tom Thumb	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- 1711 -RRB- probably served as his model .

		Like Professor Cross , Mr.
Hillhouse	PERSON	is interested in demolishing the legend of the dissipated Fielding and finds in the careful workmanship of this play evidence '' in refutation of the commonly accepted theory that Fielding 's youth was woefully misspent in an uninterrupted sowing of wild oats , and that his plays were dashed off over night on stray tobacco wrappers .

		In the case of this play , at any rate , such a theory can not stand . ''

		The composition of the play meant time and drudgery : `` the citations and references with which the notes are thickly scattered are practically all correct . ''

		Such accuracy , together with the '' careful burlesque of the char - acters , situations , and diction of tragedy give ground for the assumption that he lavished a great deal of attention on the Tragedy of Tragedies . ''

		THE
CAMBRIDGE	LOCATION	HISTORY OF AMERICAN LITERATURE .

		Vol .

		II .

		Putnam .

		This volume enjoys , like its predecessor , a pre - ponderance of bibliography some two hundred pages out of a little over six hundred .

		It is this elaborate feature which has led to publication in three volumes rather than in the two originally de - signed , and which now brings from the editors an explanation to the effect that the division into vol - umes is '' fortuitous '' and not to be taken as offering a `` classification of the subject . ''

		Book III , thus , begins somewhat past the middle of the present vol - ume , and the line is drawn between
Lowell	PERSON	and Whitman , though they were exact contemporaries
Lowell	PERSON	closing the earlier day and
Whitman	PERSON	open - ing the later one .

		Professor
Thorndike	PERSON	of
Colum	PERSON	- bia , on the former , is one of the high successes of the present volume .

		Antecedent to
Lowell	LOCATION	we find , among other items , a sharp and clear-seeing chapter on
Thoreau	LOCATION	; one on
Hawthorne	LOCATION	, with especial refer - ence to his relations to
Emerson	LOCATION	; a restrained chapter on
Poe	PERSON	; a grateful one on
Daniel Webster	PERSON	as a lit - erary man , treated with breadth and simplicity by Senator Lodge , and studies of those two diminish - ing lights ,
Longfellow	LOCATION	and
Whittier	LOCATION	.

		The latter , by Dr.
William Morton Payne	PERSON	, is a judicious blend of biography and criticism ; it is judicious too in its estimate of
Whittier	LOCATION	's essential influence on his day and in its observance of the pieties that the reader of the elder generation looks for and likes .

		Pro- fessor
Trent	ORGANIZATION	, on
Longfellow	LOCATION	, takes , though with less decisiveness , a not unrelated tone .

		Among the his - torians ,
Prescott	PERSON	and Motley are well represented ;
Bancroft	LOCATION	too , and in a rather better piece of writing .

		In the field of verse , chapters on the poets of the Civil War , both
Northern and Southern	ORGANIZATION	, will catch the eye and reward the attention in days when war poetry is strikingly to the fore .

		The short story , as a distinctly American development , is presented in its early and middle stages by Professor
Pattee	PERSON	; and the volume closes with an entertaining chapter on Books for Children , which runs the gamut from
Spiritual Milk	ORGANIZATION	for

		FORCED MOVEMENTS , TROPISM AND ANI - MAL CONDUCT .

		By
Jacques Loeb	PERSON	.

		Lippincott ;
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		This is the first of a series of Monographs on Ex - perimental Biology under the editorship of Dr.
J. Loeb	PERSON	, Dr.
T. H. Morgan	PERSON	, and Dr.
W. J. V. Oster	PERSON	- hout .

		The aim is to present the results of recent in - vestigations in a number of subjects now in the fore - ground of interest among students of biological science .

		Dr.
Loeb	PERSON	's book offers a typical illustration of the application to animal behavior of the methods of investigation employed by modern students of experimental embryology , genetics , and the psysio - logical activities of the body , and these are essen - tially the methods of the physicist and the chemist .

		The author says : Animal conduct is known to many through the romantic tales of popularizers , through the descriptive work of biological observers , or through the attempts of vitalists to show the inadequacy of physical laws for the explana - tion of life .

		Since none of these contributions are based upon quantitative experiments , they have led only to speculations , which are generally of an anthropomorphic or of a purely verbalistic character .

		It is the aim of this monograph to show that the subject of animal con - duct can be treated by the quantitative methods of the physicist , and that these methods lead to the forced move - ment or tropism theory of animal conduct .

		For the analysis of animal behavior much im - portance is attached to this phenomenon of forced movements .

		Animals with certain unilateral in - juries to the brain are no longer able to proceed in a straight line and are compelled to travel toward one side .

		This is explained as a result of the un - equal tension or tonus of the symmetrical muscles on the two sides of the body .

		The behavior of animals with asymmetrical brain injuries suggests that the movements classed as tropisms are also forced , although in the latter case the turning is temporary , lasting only so long as the two sides of the body are unequally affected by the external stimulus .

		The term tropism covers a variety of responses of animals and plants in which the or - ganism comes to orient itself in symmetrical rela - tions to some outer stimulating agency .

		For the explanation of tropisms the symmetry of the body is an important feature .

		In an insect illuminated more on one side than on the other the muscles connected with the more strongly illumin - ated eye are thrown into a stronger tension , and if now impulses for locomotion originate in the central nervous system , they will no longer produce an equal response in the symmetrical muscles , but a stronger one in the muscles turning the head and body of the animal to the THE DIAL 429 m the teaching of history means original inquiry into the ultimate purposes of historical instruction and concentration on those ends .

Beard	ORGANIZATION	and

April 19	DATE	source of light .

		The animal will thus be compelled to change the direction of its motion and to turn to the scource of light .

		As soon as the plane of symmetry goes through the source of light , both eyes receive again equal illumination , the tension -LRB- or tonus -RRB- of symmetrical mus - cles becomes equal again , and the impulses for locomo - tion will now produce equal activity in the symmetrical muscles .

		As a consequence , the animal will move in a straight line to the source of light until some other asymmetrical disturbance once more changes the direction of motion .

		This statement embodies the essential features of
Loeb	PERSON	's theory of tropisms .

		With certain modifica - tions the explanation of the orientation of an in - sect to light may be extended to the phototropism of other animals , and to the tropic responses of or - ganisms to gravity , contact , the electric current , and many other sources of stimuli .

		Tropisms are thus resolved into reflex acts , or actions essentially re - flex in character , which take place as involuntarily as the reaction of a nerve-muscle preparation of an isolated frog 's leg .

		One of the most important features of the trop - isms theory is that it affords a mechanistic explana - tion of many so-called instincts .

		Dr.
Loeb	PERSON	appears not to be daunted by the wonderful complexity and perfection which instinctive performances sometimes exhibit .

		In the short chapter on instinct he shows how some relatively simple activities which are com - monly described as instinctive may plausibly be re - solved into tropisms .

		But anyone who attempts to prove that instincts in general are '' tropistic reac - tions '' has undertaken a large contract , and the reader of the chapter on instinct can scarcely fail to be impressed with the intrepidity with which the author enters upon his task .

		Dr.
Loeb	PERSON	is in the habit of thinking of phenomena in terms of their simplest manifestations , and he has an especial fondness for simple explanations .

		Despite its apparent shortcom - ings , his method of procedure may be justified in that it has so often led to significant discoveries ; yet one can not but think that in his unduly simplified treatment of the problem of instinct he has been be - trayed into an inadequate analysis by his habitual assumption of the irrelevancy of the complex .

		Many instincts such as nest building , comb making , cocoon spinning , or orb weaving , are riot resolvable into acts which may properly be termed tropisms .

		Often complex instincts may be analyzed in terms of re - flexes to outer stimuli , but in other cases the prompt - ings to action arise from within instead of from with - out the organism .

		In either case the behavior may be the expression of the creature 's inherited organiza - tion quite as much as if it were a mere Cartesian automaton .

		Doubtless tropisms afford important component factors of instinctive behavior , and they may constitute the phylogenic roots of elaborate and specialized reactions ; but this in no wise justifies us in the conclusion that instincts are properly describ - able as merely '' tropistic responses . ''

		They may be mechanistically explicable , but tropisms are not the only types of response into which they may be construed .

		The last chapter , Memory Images and Tropisms , sets forth a mechanistic interpretation of associative memory and describes the modifications of tropisms by memory images .

		Only a brief excursion is made into the field of the psychology of higher animals and human beings , and that with the purpose of showing the possible application of the tropism theory to human psychology .

		THE ENGLISH POETS .

		Edited by
Thomas Humphrey Ward	PERSON	.

		Vol .


V. Browning	PERSON	to
Rupert Brooke	ORGANIZATION	.


Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	.

		When the four volumes of
Ward	ORGANIZATION	's English Poets were published in
1880	DATE	, one might have predicted that a fifth would at some time be necessary ; for
Tennyson	PERSON	and
Browning	PERSON	,
Swinburne	PERSON	and
Morris	PERSON	, not to mention
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, though they had done almost all the work by which they were to be remembered , were alive and therefore not to be included , and without them the representation of the nineteenth century verse was almost absurdly inadequate .

		Now , almost forty years later , this necessary volume appears , with every mark of being meant to conclude the series .

		One may congratulate Mr.
Ward	PERSON	on surviving to complete his now classic anthology .

		He has chosen a fitting point at which to close it ; for by the death of
Rupert Brooke	ORGANIZATION	in
1915	DATE	nearly all those who had helped to shape the character of the previous century were available , and
Brooke	PERSON	himself , as one complex of the forces that set in with the turn of the new century , was happily qualified to carry on without suggesting any necessary venture into the later field .

		A great period was rounded out and its sequel hinted at .

		As you look down the table of contents you miss few names that you would care greatly to have included , and those mostly of Nestors like
Austin Dobson	PERSON	.

		One gap there is however which is start - ling .

		By any fair estimate
Oscar Wilde	PERSON	should have his place in the list , if only for the
Ballad of Reading Gaol	ORGANIZATION	.

		One hopes that his exclusion was due to copyright difficulties and not , as one suspects , to a British sense of decorum , unwilling to revive disquieting memories .

		As for the selections by which the various poets are represented , one has to remember that no an - thology has ever entirely satisfied readers who have opinions of their own .

		In the present volume many will be surprised that
Stevenson	PERSON	should be allotted nearly twice as much space as
George Meredith	PERSON	and more than three times as much as
Fitzgerald	PERSON	, who gets less than
Thomas Gordon Hale	PERSON	or any one of half a dozen respectables .

		Many others will feel that to represent
Calverley	PERSON	without either The Cock and the Bull or Forever or the Ode to To - bacco is a mockery , as also to print eleven pages of
Christina Rossetti	PERSON	with never a one of her thrilling sonnets .

		Criticism of this kind however is always inevitable and , in this case , has only incidental bear - ing on the excellence of the anthology as a whole .

April 19	DATE	Besides , one does not turn to this work solely for the poetical extracts .

		One great value of the original four volumes was in the introductions to the separate parts , themselves an anthology of the most judicious criticism of that day .

		In this matter the present volume may fairly court comparison with its prede - cessors .

		Most of the names , of course , are new ; for the forty years that have brought so many poets into the collection have also eliminated many critics .

		Mr.
Ward	PERSON	has survived to continue the tradition , and so has Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	; in place of the others we have a new set , among whom may be noted Sir
Richard Jebb	PERSON	for

		THE POETS OF THE FUTURE .

		Edited by
Henry T. Schnittkind	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
Stratford Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		When President
Wilson	PERSON	said that young people , instead of being radical in their views , are inclined to be very conservative , he enlisted what had once been a daring paradox into the ranks of our favor - ite platitudes .

		If the statement needed any further proof , one could find plenty in Mr.
Schnittkind	PERSON	's latest anthology of our college poets .

		The 108 poems he has chosen from 96 colleges are old-fash - ioned almost without exception .

		Modernity , with the exception of a good piece of imagism by
Royall Snow	ORGANIZATION	, is represented solely by an odd ` two-score of poems about the war .

		These however incline to be Mid-Victorian and sentimental .

		The lyrical realism of
Conrad Aiken	PERSON	and the whimsical realism of
T. S. Eliot	ORGANIZATION	are represented only by one poem of
Stephen Vincent Benet	PERSON	's ; the starker realism of Mr.
Masters	PERSON	is reflected through a romantic prism .

		There is hardly anything in the whole volume that could not have appeared the doubtful assent of the editors being granted in the first issue of the Har - vard Monthly , back in the eighties .

		Along with the almost universal conservatism goes a certain technical carelessness .

		The theory so assiduously spread abroad by
Sara Teasdale	PERSON	and
H. L. Mencken	PERSON	that poets are best when young , and require almost no training has evidently been bearing fruit .

		One symptom of it is the quantity of free verse written by people who have apparently no idea of the difference between free verse and the sort of stuff that Professor
Patterson	PERSON	calls '' spaced prose . ''

		Another symptom is the number of nursery quatrains .

		Yet another , the quantity of poems rhymed sloppily .

		There are two or three sonnets in the collection sonnets very far from the strict Italian model and one ode to
Spring	DATE	, the latter cor - rect enough to have been written by
Grey	ORGANIZATION	or
Collins	PERSON	.

		For the rest , the verse is loose rather than free .

		The good workmanship to which
Swinburne	PERSON	and
Tenny	PERSON	- son devoted their lives seems to be an ideal either above or below the majority of these our younger poets .

		The blame for a volume of such low standards must rest either with our colleges or with the anthol - ogist .

		As far as the students go , one can allege the war .

		Yet the war had little effect outside of the sentimental on the young women of our univer - sities , who have always played a large part in the junior poetic movement .

		One suspects the much - advertised renaissance of poetry .

		On the other hand , although one has no way of checking up Mr.
Schnitt	PERSON	- kind , and although he is perhaps the only man who has read the magazines of all the 96 colleges repre - sented , one does come to question his work through a knowledge of a few of the student periodicals .

		The basis of selection is much fairer than in the past two anthologies , yet the anthologist persists in his Braithwaitian love of the sentimental .

		And there are still curious lacunae .

		Though the one poem he chose from
Yale	ORGANIZATION	is excellent , there was much other good verse in the
Yale Literary Monthly	ORGANIZATION	.

		The best work of
Princeton	LOCATION	and
Williams	PERSON	and
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	is hardly represented .

		At the same time there is much atro - cious poetry from the
University of Southern Cali	ORGANIZATION	- fornia and
Agnes Scott College	ORGANIZATION	.

		Perhaps Mr.
Schnittkind	PERSON	's choice was geographical rather than literary .

		If he was hard put to it to make up a book , he might have taken 108 poems by
Stephen Vincent Benet	PERSON	and arrived at a much better result than he did .

		At any rate , one can see little use for the anthology he has published .

		It is either a libel on the poetry of the American college , or else the poetry of the American college does not deserve an anthology .

		THE DIAL A FORTNIGHTLY Democracy and Direct Action JLHE BATTLE for political democracy has been won : white men everywhere are to live under the regime of parliamentary government .


Russia	LOCATION	, which for the present is trying a new form of constitution , will probably be led by internal or external pressure to adopt the system favored by the Western powers .

		But even before this contest was decided a new one was seen to be beginning .

		The form of govern - ment in the
United States	LOCATION	,
Britain	LOCATION	, and
France	LOCATION	is a capitalistic or plutocratic democracy : the democracy which exists in the political sphere finds no counter - part in the economic world .

		The struggle for eco - nomic democracy seems likely to dominate politics for many years to come .

		The Russian government , which cares nothing for the forms of political democ - racy , stands for a very extreme form of economic democracy .

		A strong and apparently growing party in
Germany	LOCATION	has similar aims .

		Of opinion in
France	LOCATION	I know nothing , but in this country the workers who desire to obtain control of industries subject to state ownership , though not sufficiently strong numerically to have much influence on the personnel of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, are nevertheless able through organi - zation in key industries to exert a powerful pressure on the government and to cause fear of industrial upheavals to become widespread throughout the middle and upper classes .

		We have thus the spec - tacle of opposition between a new democratically - elected
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	and the sections of the nation which consider themselves the most democratic .

		In such circumstances many friends of democracy be - come bewildered and grow perplexed as to the aims they ought to pursue or the party with which they ought to sympathize .

		The time was when the idea of parliamentary government inspired enthusiasm , but that time is past .

		Already before the war legislation had come to be more and more determined by contests between interests outside the legislature , bringing pressure to bear directly upon the government .

		This ten - dency has been much accelerated .

		The view which prevails in the ranks of organized labor and not only there is that
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	exists merely to give effect to the decision of the government , while those decisions themselves , so far from representing any settled policy , embody nothing but the momentary balance of forces and the compromise most likely to secure temporary peace .

		The weapon of labor in these contests is no longer the vote , but the threat of a strike '' direct action . ''

		It was the leaders of the
Confederation Generale du Travail	ORGANIZATION	during the twenty years preceding the war who first developed this theory of the best tactics for labor .

		But it is experience rather than theory that has led to its widespread adoption the experience largely of the untrustworthiness of parliamentary Socialist leaders and of the reactionary social forces to which they are exposed .

		To the traditional doctrine of democracy there is something repugnant in this whole method .

		Put crudely and nakedly the position is this : the organ - ized workers in a key industry can inflict so much hardship upon the community by a strike that the community is willing to yield to their demands things which it would never yield except under the threat of force .

		This may be represented as the substitution of the private force of a minority in place of law as embodying the will of the majority .

		On this basis a very formidable indictment of direct action can be built up .

		There is no denying that direct action involves grave dangers , and if abused may theoretically lead to very bad results .

		In this cpuntry , when -LRB- in
1917	DATE	-RRB- organized labor wished to send delegates to Stock - holm , the Seamen 's and
Firemen 's Union	ORGANIZATION	prevented them from doing so , with the enthusiastic approval of the capitalist press .

		Such interferences of minor - ities with the freedom of .

		action of majorities are possible ; it is also possible for majorities to interfere with the legitimate freedom of minorities .

		Like all use of force , whether inside or outside the law , direct action makes tyranny possible .

		And if one were anxious to draw a gloomy picture of terrors ahead one might prophesy that certain well-organ - ized vital industries say the
Triple Allidnce of Miners	ORGANIZATION	,
Railwaymen	ORGANIZATION	, and
Transport Workers	ORGANIZATION	would learn to combine , not only against the em - ployers , but against the community as a whole .

		We shall be told that this will happen unless a firm stand is made now .

		We shall be told that , if it 446 THE DIAL
May 3	DATE	does happen , the indignant public will have , sooner or later , to devote itself to the organization of blacklegs , in spite of the danger of civil disturbance and industrial chaos that such a course would in - volve .

		No doubt such dangers would be real if it could be assumed that organized labor is wholly destitute of common sense and public spirit .

		But such an assumption could never be made except to flatter the fears of property-owners .

		Let us leave nightmares on one side and come to the considera - tion of the good and harm that are actually likely to result in practice from the increasing resort to direct action as a means of influencing government .

		Many people speak and write as though the be - ginning and end of democracy were the rule of the majority .

		This , for example , is the view of Pro- fessor
Hearnshaw	ORGANIZATION	in his recent book Democracy at the Cross-Ways .

		But this is far too mechanical a view .

		It leaves out of account two questions of great importance , namely : -LRB- I -RRB- What should be the group of which the majority is to prevail ?

		-LRB- 2 -RRB- What are the matters with which the majority has a right to interfere ?

		Right answers to these ques - tions are essential if nominal democracy is not to develop into a new and more stable form of tyranny , for minorities and subordinate groups have the right to live , and must not be internally subject to the malice of hostile masses .

		The first question is familiar in one form , namely that of nationality .

		It is recognized as contrary to the theory of democracy to combine into one state a big nation and a small one , when the small nation desires to be * independent .

		To allow votes to the citizens of the small nation is no remedy , since they can always be outvoted by the citizens of the large nation .

		The popularly elected legislature , if it is to be genuinely democratic , must represent one nation ; or , if more are to be represented , it must be by a federal arrangement which safeguards the smaller units .

		A legislature should exist for defined purposes , and should cover a larger or smaller area according to the nature of those purposes .

		At this moment , when an attempt is being made to create a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	for certain objects , this point does not need emphasizing .

		But it is not only geographical units , such as nations , that have a right , according to the true theory of democracy , to autonomy for certain pur - poses .

		Just the same principle applies to any group which has important internal concerns that affect the members of the group enormously more than they affect outsiders .

		The coal trade , for example , might legitimately say : '' What concerns the com - munity is the quantity and price of the coal that we supply .

		But our conditions and hours of work , the technical methods of our production , and the share of the produce that we choose to allow to the land - owners and capitalists who at present own and manage the collieries , all these are internal concerns of the coal trade , in which the general public has no right to interfere .

		For these purposes we de - mand an internal parliament , in which those who are interested as owners and capitalists may have one vote each , but no more . ''

		If such a demand were put forward it would be as impossible to resist on democratic grounds as the demand for autonomy on the part of a small nation .

		Yet it is perfectly clear that the coal trade could not induce the com - munity to agree to such a proposal , especially where it infringes the '' rights of property , '' unless it were sufficiently well organized to be able to do grave injury to the community in the event of its proposal 's being rejected just as no small nation except Nor - way , so far as my memory serves me , has ever obtained independence from a large one to which it was subject , except by war or the threat of war .

		The fact is that democracies , as soon as they are well established , are just as jealous of power as other forms of government .

		It is therefore neces - sary , if subordinate groups are to obtain their rights , that they shall have some means of bringing pressure to bear upon the government .

		The Benthamite the - ory , upon which democracy is still defended by some doctrinaires , was that each voter would look after his own interest , and in the resultant each man 's interest would receive its proportionate share of attention .

		But human nature is neither so rational nor so self-centered as
Bentham	PERSON	imagined .

		In practice it is easier , by arousing hatred and jeal - ousies , to induce men to vote against the interests of others than to persuade them to vote for their own interests .

		In the recent
General Election	ORGANIZATION	in this country very few electors remembered their own interests at all .

		They voted for the man who showed the loudest zeal for hanging the
Kaiser	PERSON	, not because they imagined they would be richer if he were hanged but as an expression of disinterested hatred .

		This is one of the reasons why autonomy is important : in order that , as far as possible , no group shall have its internal concerns determined for it by those who hate it .

		And this result is not secured by the mere form of democracy ; it can only be secured by careful devolution of special powers to special groups , so as to secure , as far as possible , that legislation shall be inspired by the self-interest of those concerned , not by the hostility of those not concerned .

		This brings us to the second of the two questions mentioned above a question which is , in fact , close - ly bound up with the first .

		Our second question was : What are the matters with which the democ - racy has a right to interfere ?

		It is now generally
1919	DATE
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	447 recognized that religion , for example , is a question with which no government should interfere .

		If a Mahometan conies to live in
England	LOCATION	we do not think it right to force him to profess Christianity .

		This is a comparatively recent change ; three cen - turies ago , no state recognized the right of the indi - vidual to choose his own religion .

		-LRB- Some other personal rights have been longer recognized : a man may choose his own wife , though in Christian countries he must not choose more than one . -RRB-

		When it ceased to be illegal to hold that the earth goes round the sun , it was not made illegal to believe that the sun goes round the earth .

		In such matters it has been found , with intense surprise , that personal liberty does not entail anarchy .

		Even the sternest supporters of the rule of the majority would not hold that the
Archbishop of Canterbury	ORGANIZATION	ought to turn Buddhist if
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	ordered him to do so .

		And Parliament does not , as a rule , issue orders of this kind , largely because it is known that the resistance would be formidable and that it would have support in public opinion .

		In theory , the formula as to legitimate interfer - ences is simple .

		A democracy has a right to inter - fere with those of the affairs of a group which inti - mately concern people outside the group , but not with those which have comparatively slight effects outside the group .

		In practice , this formula may sometimes be difficult to apply , but often its appli - cation is clear .

		If , for example , the Welsh wish to have their elementary education conducted in
Welsh	LOCATION	, that is a matter which concerns them so much more intimately than anyone else that there can be no good reason why the rest of the
United Kingdom	ORGANIZATION	should interfere .

		Thus the theory of democracy demands a good deal more than the mere mechani - cal supremacy of the majority .

		It demands : -LRB- I -RRB- division of the community into more , or less auton - omous groups ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- delimitation of the powers of the autonomous groups by determining which of their concerns are so much more important to them - selves than to others that others had better have no say in them .

		Direct action may , in most cases , be judged by these tests .

		In an ideal democracy in - dustries or groups of industries would be self - governing as regards almost everything except the price and quantity of their product , and their self - government would be democratic .

		Measures which they would then be able to adopt autonomously they are now justified in extorting from the government by direct action .

		At present the extreme limit of imaginable official concession is a conference in which the men and the employers are represented equally , but this is very far from democracy , since the men are much more numerous than the em - ployers .

		This application of majority-rule is abhor - rent to those who invoke majority-rule against direct - actionists ; yet it is absolutely in accordance with the principles of democracy .

		It must at best be a long and difficult process to procure formal self - government for industries .

		Meanwhile they have the same right that belongs to oppressed national groups , the right of securing the substance of auton - omy by making it difficult and painful to go against their wishes in matters primarily concerning themselves .

		So long as they confine themselves to such matters , their action is justified by the strictest principles of theoretical democracy , and those who decry it have been led by prejudice to mistake the empty form of democracy for its substance .

		Certain practical limitations , however , are impor - tant to remember .

		In the first place , it is unwise for a section to set out to extort concessions from the government by force , if in the long run public opinion will be on the side of the government .

		For a government backed by public opinion will be able , in a prolonged struggle , to defeat any subordinate section .

		In the second place , it is important to render every struggle of this kind , when it does occur , a means of educating the public opinion by making facts known which would otherwise remain more or less hidden .

		In a large community most people know very little about the affairs of other groups than their own .

		The only way in which a group can get its concerns widely known is by afford - ing '' copy '' for the newspapers , and by showing itself sufficiently strong and determined to command respect .

		When these conditions are fulfilled , even if it is force that is brought to bear upon the gov - ernment , it is persuasion that is brought to bear upon the community .

		And in the long run no vic - tory is secure unless it rests upon persuasion , and employs force at most as a means to persuasion . '

		The mention of the press and its effect on public opinion suggests a direction in which direct action has sometimes been advocated , namely to counteract the capitalist bias of almost all great newspapers .

		One can imagine compositors refusing to set up some statement about trade-union action which they know to be directly contrary to the truth .

		Or they might insist on setting up side by side a statement of the case from the Trade-union standpoint .

		Such a weapon , if it were used sparingly and judiciously , might do much to counteract the influence of the newspapers in misleading public opinion .

		So long as the capitalist system persists , most newspapers are bound to be capitalist ventures and to present '' facts , '' in the main , in the way that suits capital - istic interests .

		A strong case can be made out for the use of direct action to counteract this tendency .

		But it is obvious that very grave dangers would attend such a practice if it became common .

		A 448 THE DIAL
May 3	DATE	censorship of the press by trade unionists would , in certain cases , for example where there has been the long run , be just as harmful as any other censor - infringement of some important right such as free ship .

		It is improbable , however , that the method speech , it may be justifiable .

		The second of the could be carried to such extremes , since if it were , above uses of the strike , for the fundamental change a special set of blackleg compositors would be of the economic system , has been made familiar by trained up , and no others would gain admission to the French Syndicalists .

		It seems fairly certain the offices of capitalist newspapers .

		In this case , as that , for a considerable time to come , the main in others , the dangers supposed to belong to the struggle in
Europe	LOCATION	will be between capitalism and method of direct action are largely illusory , owing some form of Socialism , and it is highly probable to the natural limitations of its effectiveness .

		that in this struggle the strike will play a great Direct action may be employed : -LRB- I -RRB- for ameliora - part .

		To introduce democracy into industry by any tion of trade conditions within the present economic other method would be very difficult .

		And the system ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- for economic reconstruction , including principle of group autonomy justifies this method the partial or complete abolition of the capitalist so long as the rest of the community opposes self - system ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- for political ends , such as altering the government for industries which desire it .

		Direct form of government , extension of the suffrage , or action has its dangers , but so has every vigorous amnesty for political prisoners .

		Of these three no f orm O f activity .

		And in our recent realization of one nowadays would deny the legitimacy of the first , the i mportance o f law we must not forget that the except in exceptional circumstances .

		The third , grea test of all dangers to a civilization is to become except for purposes of establishing democracy where stereot yped and stagnant .

		From this danger , at it does not yet exist , seems a dubious expedient if j industrial unrest is likely to save us .

		democracy , in spite of its faults , is recognized as the best practicable form of government ; but in

		CALE YOUNG RICE .

		1919 THE DIAL 449 Factualist Versus Impressionist IN A CERTAIN prodigious year of beginnings and endings , now unspeakably remote , the novel read - ers of this country might have discovered them - selves to be the richer by a simple romance called The Lay
Anthony	PERSON	.

		No great multitude appears to have performed the exploit .

		By a recent calcula - tion of Mr.
Joseph Hergesheimer	PERSON	, the author of that romance who seems to have a modest im - pression that his first book was not , perhaps , the signal event of
1914	DATE	the copy now open at the title-page on this desk is one solid nine-hundredth of all that were sold .

		Beside it there lies , in this the month of its appearance , a copy of
Java Head	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- Knopf -RRB- inscribed : `` First and second printings before publication .

		Published
January , 1919	DATE	. ''

		Moreover , the conservative novel reader who prefers to take his pleasure from between covers seemingly he still exists was not vouch - safed a glimpse of this particular delight until the tale , serialized in a weekly of circulation so stag - gering that the actual figures sound like those of a war '' drive '' by some organization of immense prestige , had unfolded itself to eyes countable only in hundreds of thousands of pairs .

		It is a screaming contrast , that here denoted .

		If one has the cynicism of experience , the first effect of such a contrast is to set one hunting for clues in the author himself .

		There must have gone on in him , one figures , some process analogous to that which went on in Mr.
Robert Chambers	PERSON	between The King in Yellow and , say , The Danger Mark some conscious or unconscious adulteration of the genuine with the spurious .

		The author of The Lay
Anthony	PERSON	, like the hero thereof , was good and , duly , lonesome : it is simple to conclude , then , that the author of
Java	LOCATION	Head , to whom crowds flock and profits accrue , must have turned meretrix .

		Well , cynicism hunts in vain .

		Java Head is in the same straight line with The Lay
Anthony	PERSON	, and it is the line of an almost prohibitively austere ideal pursued with inflexible fidelity .

		Search as you will the two volumes which delimit his career thus far , you find no increase in the recognized marks of that commercially potent thing , popu - larity .

		You find , if anything , a decrease : it is the austerity that increases .

		For the austerity of The Lay
Anthony	PERSON	is merely that of the remote ideal proposed , sought , clutched at , honestly missed , per - haps despaired of for the moment ; whereas the austerity of
Java	LOCATION	Head is that of the same elusive ideal attained , captured , crystallized in a lovely form of words .

		It is almost enough to provoke a speculation that the multitude must have changed overnight graduated from its mere occasional will - ingness io receive a grain of wheat along with bushels of chaff , and joined the cults and the coteries in their preference for that which is nothing if not '' art . ''

		Preposterous , of course , yet a more nearly tenable theory than that Mr.
Hergesheimer	PERSON	has by intention or accident sought the multitude where it is customarily at home .

		It is not my wish to represent The Lay
Anthony	PERSON	as in itself a masterpiece , or even a strikingly eminent piece of fiction .

		But it is promissory of masterpieces , and in kind if not in degree it claims kinship with the most eminent work its author has done .

		This is a judgment which can derive its sanc - tion only from some general view of what Mr.
Hergesheimer	PERSON	is about .

		Even for the reader who has not yet discovered this author , or who , having blundered upon him , is not aware of having scaled any very notable peak in
Darien	LOCATION	, I can give the argument significance and scope by saying that what Hergesheimer is about is precisely what the art of fiction itself has been about during the thirty years past , whenever its manifestations have been most arresting and distinguished .

		However sweeping his claims to blissful ignorance about the technicalities of his art , it is clear that he has read the right things very understandingly , and kept himself sensitive to currents and eddies in the air round him .

		He is of the moderns ; and without any elaborate and self - conscious repudiations of the past without , for in - stance , having to go through the process of audibly despising the Victorians just because he is quite unlike them he avails himself , in a quite natural and urbane and effortless way , of the most impor - tant structural and tonal changes that have made fiction a finer art now than it ever was .

		What are the chief of these changes ?

		All of them , I think , can be grouped under the spacious word '' impressionism . ''

		The difference between the more and the less distinguished in present fic - tion is the difference between impressionistic real - ism and factualistic realism .

		A factual realist ` is a narrator who adopts life itself as his selective prin - ciple and , on the assumption that whatever is is artistic , ' determines the material of his tale solely by its accord with what actually does , or easily could , happen .

		But the impressionistic realist chooses his material in accordance with the inherent need of his subject to be developed in a particular way , and while remaining faithful to the general 450 THE DIAL
May 3	DATE	laws of how things occur in human nature , and perhaps even to the specific details of how they occur in human civilization , he regulates the shape and size and color of his product by requirements which exist rather in his theme than outside it .

		The difference in result is like that between a para - sitic vine which follows slavishly the contour of whatever happens to support it , and a bud which follows simply an inner compulsion to unfold into a particular kind of flower , and must be either that flower or nothing .

		To make the long story short , it is the difference between Mr.
Howells	PERSON	and
Henry James	PERSON	; between
J. D. Beresford	PERSON	or
Gilbert Cannan	PERSON	and Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	; between
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	and
Conrad	PERSON	.

		It is also the difference be - tween
Alice Brown	PERSON	or
Zona Gale	PERSON	or
Rupert Hughes	PERSON	or Isabel Paterson conscientious f actual - ists mainly and
Joseph Hergesheimer	PERSON	, impres - sionist .

		There are two chief symptoms of this difference .

		One of them is the presence or absence of unity in the point of view , either throughout the whole or throughout each chapter .


Henry James	PERSON	reached , by
1890	DATE	, the point where this kind of unity be - came an indispensable canon of his art ; Mr.
Gals	PERSON	- worthy in nearly all his work , and
Conrad	PERSON	in the best of his , have followed him .

		The other symp - tom is the presence or absence of absolute single - ness or centrality in the whole work singleness of situation , of purpose , of accent , of impression ; such singleness as belongs to the ideal short-story .

		The first of these developments puts the stress , not on what happens in the story , but on the signifi - cance of the happenings to some sympathetic ob - serving consciousness .

		The second fuses action , character , setting , dialogue , all the physical in - gredients of the tale , into the same unity of effect which Poe demanded in ballad or lyric , and which even pundits now clamor for in the short tale .

		The short tale has had that singleness for fifty years ; what is significant is that , in the last twenty-five , the novel has discovered that it can not live up to its privileges without exactly the same totality .

		Years ago
Henry James	PERSON	wrote , in The Sacred Fount , a parable of this necessity , in the form of a crucial instance of the war between factualism and impressionism that is to say , between raw '' life '' and fictional composition .

		Criticism is still so far behind that , to this day , there does not exist in print an intelligible analysis of The Sacred Fount , one of the great documents of esthetic theory .


Henry James	PERSON	began , obviously , as an externalist , a fac - tualist , saturating himself with life ; he came out an impressionist , saturating himself with nothing but the sense of his theme .

		Even Meredith approached , less understandingly , the same consummation : he wrote Feverel under the influence of
Dickens	LOCATION	, but he wrote Lord Ormont and His Aminta under the same Zeitgeist that wrought The Spoils of Poyn - ton and The Red Badge of Courage and
Conrad in Quest of His Youth and Heart of Darkness	ORGANIZATION	.

		The critics , some of them , seem still not to know which way the wind blows but a few artists know , and the author of
Java	LOCATION	Head is clearly one of ^ them .

		The title-page of
Java	LOCATION	Head quotes : '' It is only the path of pure simplicity which guards and pre - serves the spirit . ''

		The direct literal application of the proverb is presumably to the moral life of
Taou Yuen	PERSON	, the wondrous Manchu lady whom
Gerrit Ammidon	PERSON	, a hot-tempered individualist , marries and brings into the staid
New England Salem	LOCATION	of the days when Mr.
Polk	PERSON	was President and clippers were brand new in the
China	LOCATION	trade .


Taou Yuen	PERSON	, by uttermost simplicity of spirit , finds her way un - erringly her way to beauty and to the preserva - tion of her own exquisite serenity first through all the deviousness of social Salem , against the back - ground of the Ammidons ' commercial greatness and general prestige ; then through the complica - tions of an astounding intrigue of which she be - comes , innocently , the center .

		Clinging faithfully in her bewilderment to the few simple ideals of conduct which scores of generations have bred into her blood as well as her mind , maintaining to the end the poise of her own fatalistic philosophy , she gives a sense of living exclusively with fundamen - tals and essentials , in the midst of a society preoc - cupied with trivial externals .

		It is she , the alien , who lives at the center of the life she has entered , working her way with a patient simplicity to the core of its realities , while the others , the indigenes even Gerrit the individualist and rebel live , by comparison , unreally and at the fringe of things , making motions they hardly know the sense of .

		They exist , as it were , from hand to mouth , letting the effect achieved in one moment supply the con - duct of the next , exactly like a realistic novel ; whereas
Taou Yuen	PERSON	is living , at every moment , as for eternity .

		This is why the fine gesture with v which she chooses death , being the ultimate affirm - ation of her pure serenity and disregard of compli - cating non-essentials , has in itself immortal love - liness .

		The death of any other character would be incompletion , unfulfillment , because the others are living in a more or less straight line , and a line can be cut off .

		But her life , is always complete from moment to moment : she is living in a sphere , and a sphere is always as round as it can be .

		Now the Chinese proverb about simplicity ex - actly expresses
Hergesheimer	ORGANIZATION	's ideal for his own art ; and
Taou Yuen	PERSON	is the natural symbol of the
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 45 goal toward which his writing has progressed since he began to publish it .


Taou Yuen	PERSON	is a simple im - pressionist forced into a society of complicated factualists , and emerging from it without im - pairment to the inner principle of her being .

		Hergesheimer 's career thus far shows a similar contention of elements and a similar culmination the logical completion of a natural bent toward impressionism .

		One evidence that his art has indeed found the path of pure simplicity is his present instinct to interpret into his earlier work an impressionistic unity which is not completely there , through simple inability to tolerate the thought that he was ever actuated by any impulse except the only one now possible to him .

		He summarizes the theme of The Lay
Anthony	PERSON	-LRB-
1914	DATE	-RRB- as `` a boy 's purity in a world where that quality is a cause for excruciat - ing jest ; '' and that of Mountain Blood -LRB-
1915	DATE	-RRB- as '' the failure of an aged man to repair a spiritual wrong with gold . ''

		The Lay
Anthony	PERSON	is indeed a winning and faithful likeness of youth as it is , with its queer fits and starts of quixotism , the tremors of its response to beauty , its oscillation between a fantastic idealism and a still more fantastic prac - ticality .

		The physical purity of
Anthony Ball	PERSON	is preserved by a combination of forces ; sheer acci - dent wearing at times the aspect of sheer fate , and also something boyish , inhibiting , and virginal in himself .

		But through the theme , because it was imperfectly grasped as an idea which should have engendered the details making up its own atmos - phere , there stick the most oddly irrelevent and jarring minutiae baseball , chewing gum , differ - entials , fashions in collars ,
thirty-one dollars	MONEY	and
seventy cents	MONEY	put in , not because they are true to the theme , but because they are locally and tem - porally true , because the author knows them , be - cause the artist distrusts the creator in himself and leans on the copyist .

		In
Mountain Blood	ORGANIZATION	, a story of a primitive community in the
West Virginia	LOCATION	mountains , this tyranny of actuality over imagina - tion is carried to a point which means the practical extinction of the theme .

		Mountain Blood is a rousing story ; it would even make a tremendous motion picture without complete annihilation of its identity ; but it is certainly not , in any consistent artistic sense , the focused story of '' an aged man 's failure to repair a spiritual wrong with gold , '' and for that reason it remains , of all
Hergesheimer	ORGANIZATION	's work , least Hergesheimerian .

		There is one more lapse into factualism , that of The Dark Fleece -LRB- one of the three tales in Gold and Iron ,
1918	DATE	-RRB- , in which Mr.
Hergesheimer	PERSON	is lured into a startling breach of his point of view by the pursuit of a theme which seems always to have had a peculiar fascination for him the nature and effects of re - ligious fanaticism .

		These are , I think , the only serious aberrations .

		In The Three Black
Pennys	PERSON	-LRB-
1917	DATE	-RRB- he binds to - gether into fundamental unity the parts of a story as disjointed , from the merely factualist point of view , as a story could be , with three protagonists in three quite separate generations .

		He is able to accomplish this because his real protagonist is not a person at all , but a recrudescent family trait and its modifications over a century and a half .

		It is for the sake of that trait , a sort of creative indi - vidualism and rebellion which crops out at inter - vals in the Penny family , against its wonted back - ground of sober rectitude , that the whole spectacle is conjured into existence , an impressive documenta - tion of the social and economic history of
America	LOCATION	.

		Wild Oranges , the first tale of Gold and Iron , is a piece of atmosphere entirely appropriate to a writer who had once gone out of his way to make a character remark that
Heart of Darkness	ORGANIZATION	is `` the most beautiful story of our time ; ''
Tubal Cain	PERSON	, the second story of the volume , is unified by a trait of character , an idee fixe , as
Wild Oranges	ORGANIZATION	is by its atmosphere ; and there is an exquisite felic - ity in the title which brackets the three stories to - gether into an idea .

		And now
Java Head	ORGANIZATION	, a thing so consummate of its kind as almost to make one tremble for the author of it , in the wonder how he can either excel it or endure failure to excel it .

		Here at last is the matchless integrity once glimpsed and missed by ever so little in The Lay
Anthony	PERSON	, almost lost sight of in
Mountain Blood	ORGANIZATION	, recovered in the spirit but obscured by the amorphous body of
The Three Black Pennys	ORGANIZATION	.

		In
Java	LOCATION	Head the spirit creates the body after its kind .

		There is both singleness of esthetic effect and singleness of con - crete situation .

		The ten chapters , each from the point of view of one of the chief personae , succeed one another like a string of delicately tinted pearls clasped round the neck of
Taou Yuen	PERSON	in her strange situation ; and for her exist too the ma - chinery and the scholarship , the re-created Salem of old days , the harbor and its decaying jetties , the ships under clouds of white canvas making the heart lift , the three generations of Ammidons , the great house named to symbolize the '' happy end of an arduous voyage , '' the loves and the gossipings , all the vistaed loveliness of things native and exotic .

		There , in creation of loveliness , is the goal of this writer 's endeavor .

		There too is the lesson for criticism to interpret to his contemporary tellers of tales , cisatlantic and other .

		For the novel in gen - eral , as for this one artist , the path of pure simplic - ity , that leads from factualism to impressionism , is the path to beauty .

		WILSQN 45 2 THE DIAL
May 3	DATE
Paul Cams AT	ORGANIZATION	is WHEN halfway on the
Road	LOCATION	, as our friends begin in such solemn procession to quit our ken , that death brings with it a new bewilderment besides its primitive power to shock the feelings .

		It brings now a tragic cunning to awaken the thoughts .

		In taking the friend away , it first shows us with a grave high challenge the friend , detached and whole , who was before to us but half-regarded fragments among infinite other fragments .

		So it is that by middle life not a little of our thinking goes into the organized effort to appraise individual character and influence ; and the effort , though not unworthy as effort , is as result -LRB- we all know -RRB- a grievous confusion for life can not comprehend life , even when isolated and clarified by death .

		This elemental truth has been particularly brought home to me of late by the passing of
Paul Carus	PERSON	.

		For he was a man so greatly and diversely * alive , with so many interests , activities , contacts sym - bolizing and illustrating so many issues .

		But I can at least refuse to complicate the moment by attempt - ing to appraise him for others ; let me set down these few paragraphs , as if simply to help myself .

		I think , inevitably , first of his big , rugged human - ity , so well squaring with his philosophy but so gloriously untainted by that unctious serviceability of those who practice humanity as a deduction from their philosophy .

		Profoundly absorbed as he was in his own enterprises as publisher , thinker , and father in a large household , he had the zest and the strength for so many little kindnesses here and there by the way that of themselves they would alone constitute good works enough to fulfill and justify any life of three score and ten lacking three .

		Not that he could not dislike with the same zest .

		I have a list of his pet aversions : certain pompous orators , tricky business men , smug politicians , ver - bose philosophers the shams and the exploiters .

		But they served only his abounding sense of humor and the bearded volubility of his table talk ; there was not one of them he could have done a mean turn even if he had summoned to the ungracious task all the formidable domination of his unshorn , massive head and his stocky physique .

		A fighter , but always in the open and on the square , indiffer - ent to self , if only the truth of the object prevail .

		And what might the object be ?

		Literally , any - thing .

		For him any thing was some thing : on con - sciously conceived principle , a some-thing because it was a hint , a manifestation of one or another of those universal laws that made the monistic world he so valiantly preached ; but more immediately , a some-thing because , merely , of his inveterate instinct to look into and round about .

		.

		His acquisitions were enormous ; in an age of a thousand specialties he seemed to take , like
Bacon	PERSON	, all knowledge for his province .

		In the course of one morning at La Salle he piloted me through his father-in-law 's fuming zinc factory , traversed
Kant	PERSON	,
Alfred the Great	PERSON	,
Empedocles	LOCATION	, and
Gummere	PERSON	's ballad theories on the way to the composing rooms , and then with whimsical mirth analyzed the character of a huge printer in his establishment who got drunk and wanted to divorce a wizened wife for cruel and abusive treatment .

		All was grist to his mill , grist and not chaff or grit , and the mill seldom clogged but continued to grind out a definite brand .

		Some smaller mill-owners , resenting this , said he showed a lack of sense for relative values .

		He showed the same '' lack '' in taking up with incongruous people .

		In turning over the pages of
The Monist	ORGANIZATION	, The Open Court , or his numerous books , besides vigor - ous correspondence with such distinguished and ill - assorted friends as
Ernst Haeckel	ORGANIZATION	,
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	, and
Pere Hyacinthe	PERSON	, one comes upon equally whole - hearted discussions with up-state clergymen in
Michigan	LOCATION	or small-town doctors in
Illinois	LOCATION	sub - scribers doubtless .

		But I know it was not editorial courtesy that prompted him to take their thinking seriously .

		He took any thinking , or honest attempt at thinking , seriously because he was too habit - ually close to the great problems , and all men 's great shortcomings in dealing with the great prob - lems , to be much impressed with the differences between such superficialities as fame and obscurity ; and really living his mission to seek and to bring light into the world , he found none who asked or challenged too humble to arouse his interest .

		In this , as in so much besides , he often reminded me of my old teacher
William James	PERSON	, whose broad - gauge personality was cherished by this broad-gauge dogmatist quite as warmly as his pluralistic philos - ophy was repelled .

		His ceaseless vitality could not be exhausted in looking into and thinking about , even in talking about .

		It discharged itself also in making : he had
Veblen	PERSON	's two primary instincts , the instinct of craftsmanship no less than that of curi - osity .

		He expanded the
Open Court Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	till it has become veritably an '' institution '' -LRB- vide the
Evening Post	ORGANIZATION	,
New York	LOCATION	,
September 26 , 1914	DATE	-RRB- , with distinct aims and methods and with contacts all over the world .

		The bibliographical summary of his writings to
1909	DATE	is itself a book of 213 pages -LRB- Philosophy As a Science -RRB- .

		Once when two weeks on his back in the hospital he wrote a verse-drama on
Buddha	ORGANIZATION	, not perhaps important as
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 453 verse or drama , but still two weeks of giving shape to big thought instead of setting eyes to blank walls .

		Nothing but death could keep his untiring spirit still .


Paul Cams	PERSON	' name suggests many morals , on my walks in the
spring	DATE	lanes out of town .

		A graduate of
Tubingen	LOCATION	in
1876	DATE	, he found his intellectual opportunity in
America	LOCATION	, and gave to
America	LOCATION	the loyal services of a grateful German soul .

		I thought of
Paul Carus	PERSON	once when a fellow Anglo-American assured me that every German-American , had he stayed where he belonged , would still be plodding about in wooden shoes .

		A man of independent means -LRB- largely I believe through his association with that sturdy founder of the zinc factory and the
Open Court	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Hegeler	PERSON	, himself a German - American and a rare character with a romantic history -RRB- , he found in money solely instruments of liberation , liberation for his own intellectual growth , and liberation for leadership and public service in essentially uncommercial enterprises .

		He was not your rich man who writes out a check for a drinking-fountain , a monument , a whole library or university , and then goes down to the Stock Ex - change to make good the sacrifice .

		He did n't even spend his money for illuminated manuscripts and incunabula .

		A philosopher by profession , but not a professor of philosophy , he had relatively little professional recognition in
Academia	LOCATION	, though he was sometimes a lecturer before clubs and classes .

		Professor
Otto	PERSON	here at
Wisconsin	LOCATION	tells me of pick - ing him up by chance in the corridor -LRB- the
Carus	PERSON	boys were at our college -RRB- five minutes before the hour and getting him to talk to his students on
Kant	PERSON	in a luminous and well-ordered exposition without notes or other hitches .

		But most teachers , I suspect , would have begrudged him the hour .

		It was n't jealousy , for most professors are , in the security of their ivy citadels , without jealousy except perhaps toward their fellows inside the works .

		It was n't any superficiality in his philos - ophy at least not if they stopped to examine it for though , as to theory of knowledge , as to the concepts of energy and stuff , he may be inadequate , and though his whole system may be founded on a repugnant technique , or dialectic , his best thinking -LRB- as in God , an Inquiry and a Solution , or
Kant	PERSON	's Prolegomena -RRB- has the unmistakable note of the philosopher as distinct both from author of a phil - osophic monograph and from the philosophaster of the middle-class readers ' magazines .

		The neglect seems to have been due to a number of things , in - structive for the quizzical moralizer .

		In the first place , it illustrates the delimited hospitality of any established cult .

		Carus was not in any university catalogue .

		He had n't the , password .

		And he did n't obey the rules , he did n't play the game .

		His Eng - lish vocabulary , among other things , was too un - technical and his English sentences too clear and a German , too !

		And he associated with so many intellectual fools and parvenus !

		Besides , he did n't look natural .

		He could n't be classified in any de - partment .

		He meddled with the affairs of so many '' departments . ''

		Even inside the sacred walls a man who meddles with more than one '' depart - ment '' is doomed as a suspect .

		Again , his pro- digious output was in fact a disconcerting farrago .

		If one is as alert , many-faceted , and fluent as
Carus	PERSON	, he should n't have the use of a personally owned and controlled printing press always at h : s elbow .

		He never took time to write a magnum opus , and was short on footnotes .

		Writing for general enlightenment , he frequently merely popu - larized -LRB- sometimes too in rather slap-stick fashion -RRB- facts already familiar enough to the better informed .

		He would intermingle , with naive indifference to ex-cathedral dignity and scholastic reputation , fa - miliar commonplaces of higher thought amid valua - ble , original analysis of such abstruse affairs as
Kant	PERSON	's inconsistent threefold meaning of '' experi - ence '' and
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	's inconsistent fourfold meaning of '' cause . ''

		Moreover he sometimes made pal - pable blunders of fact or ventured on erratic guesses of theory .

		But , all in all , such a capital stock of brains , if properly invested , would yield enormous returns of academic prestige in any one of a half - dozen departments , if not in a whole college .

		And finally there was the paradoxical character of his relations to modern thought and the vast scope cf the synthesis he attempted .

		Of this a word more .

		An active champion of evolution in nature , man , and man 's institutions from the days when the fight was first on , he still held as firmly as Aristotle or the Schoolmen to eternal norms of truth , and was as impatient of agnosticism as was Huxley 's bishop .

		Indeed agnosticism , to him '' the egg-shell of meta - physicism '' was , with mysticism , one of the few typical isms of human speculative endeavor he could not , or would not , subsume under one or another of his principles of reconciliation .

		There could be no such thing as agnosticism any longer .

		Science is registering law after law ; the laws are the inter - related forms of one universe ; and the complex of the forms is '' the Allhood . ''

		And the result is more , too , than positivism .

		Man can grasp the Allhood because he is himself of the same stock .

		Man 's reasoning is not a subjective reconstruction by man for man : against Kant he affirms the formal factors of thought to be the formal factors of nature ; against Mill he affirms the universality of the principles of pure mathematics and pure logic : against
Bergson	PERSON	he affirms the validity of the
Intel	ORGANIZATION	- 454 THE DIAL May 3 lectual , rather than the intuitional approach , pre - cisely because it does break phenomena up into the discreet , abstract , formal ; against James he affirms that reason creates the specific activities of the will , far more than the will creates the activities of belief and reason ; against the pragmatists generally , that life does not make truth but truth life , re - affirming with the Stoics the injunction to follow nature -LRB- that is , to learn the norms and work with them -RRB- and holding with Platonism against
Nietz	PERSON	- sche that morality is conformity to an Eternal , not a psychological twist in a temporal flux .

		Withal , he seems an old-fashioned rationalist in an age that has changed all that .

		Of the two types of explana - tion , that which stresses the principle of being and that which stresses the principle of becoming the Eleatic and the
Heraclitic	LOCATION	, recurring in later times as Absolute Idealism or Creative Evolution -LRB- and combined in The World as Will and Idea -RRB- he seems to have closer affiliations with the former .

		But his own pages are dedicated to bringing '' all that '' down to date .

		The universal rational norms are the very condition of this recently discovered evolution that is supposed to have dethroned rationalism forever .

		As '' the immanent world - order of uniformities which naturally lead all crea - tures to develop toward rationality , '' they reveal a rational meaning in evolution as progress : prog - ress is not merely relative , an adjustment between organism and environment ; it is not , either , in any increased differentiation of functions and organs ; it is measurable strictly in terms of approach toward that intelligence which '' mirrors the norms '' toward the powers , culminating in man , to achieve truth -LRB- which is reas/m -RRB- , and to act upon it -LRB- which is morality -RRB- , and to love and reverence it -LRB- which is religion -RRB- .

		And so he combines old and new , orth - odoxy and heterodoxy , science and religion , and calls the result Nomotheism -LRB- Greek : nomos , law -RRB- .

		The laws of science that is , the immanent world-order have an intrinsic teleology ; determinism is still freedom where the determinant is the actor 's own character ; the logos that is , the norm becomes flesh ever and anew ; we live and move and have our being in God that is , we are all that we are by virtue of the cosmic laws in which we share .

		We are personalities , souls , but
Buddha	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- to whom
Carus	PERSON	dedicated some of his best study in books now translated into many tongues , west and east , and used in the temple-schools of
Japan	LOCATION	and
Cey	PERSON	- lon -RRB-
Buddha	ORGANIZATION	was right , as modern psychology is beginning to realize : our souls are but samskaras , soul-forms -LRB- for example , seeing , hearing , thinking -RRB- with no atman , no metaphysical entity , behind ; and salvation , with
Carus	PERSON	as with
Buddha	ORGANIZATION	, means get - ting rid of the illusion of self ; and immortality is , as with
Buddha	ORGANIZATION	, the
Karma	LOCATION	, the infinite and subtle influences of our character as men and minds , and Dr.
Carus	PERSON	-LRB- so runs his credo -RRB- lives still , for better or for worse , in this little essay and in the conscious - ness of those who read it -LRB- even as I too live in it -RRB- ; God is not personal but super-personal , nor the All of Pantheism but the Allhood of Laotze as ex - pounded in Dr.
Carus	PERSON	' own translations from the Chinese -LRB- for
Carus	PERSON	' capital-stock included , among other things , a Professorship of Oriental Linguis - tics . -RRB-

		There is no Umwertung aller Werte : mythol - ogy , religion , philosophy are evolution , are progress , and , as it were , a progress in understanding and making ideographs , alphabets , metaphors , symbols .

		Christ is true , but so is Apollo there is no last oracle .

		And Christianity was '' the fulfillment '' proclaimed by the Apostle , the result of antecedent historical and spiritual forces , as strikingly pre - sented in his scholarly but popular little book called The Pleromar and he advised more than one trou - bled cleric , whom the times had made shaky in the faith , to stick to his job .

		Dr.
Carus	PERSON	belongs in the Protestant manner , as Cardinal
Mercier	PERSON	-LRB- today so famous for preserving the heroic of thought in the heroic of action -RRB- belongs in the Catholic manner , to the modernists of science who are the mediators of tradition .

		This hospitality to all points of view , this reso - lution of factual opposites and logical antinomies was it a good or not ?

		I do n't know .

		It doubtless helped to stabilize himself and many others in an age of spiritual shake-ups and change .

		It doubt - less serves as an impressive reminder of the organic continuity of history , its institutions and creeds .

		But as , a dialectic method it may tend to obscur - antism , however far from the obscurantism of
Hegel	ORGANIZATION	.

		Certain things are different , if only be - cause , as
James	PERSON	used to say , they make a difference ; and they should be named differently .

		Dr.
Carus	PERSON	may live on in my thought ; but I shall never see Dr.
Carus	PERSON	again because Dr.
Carus	PERSON	has gone to his long sleep and I shall soon be going to mine , and there are no hands across the seas of death .

		The immortality of the Buddhist 's '' Karma '' and the immortality of the Christian 's '' personality '' are two different immortalities ; and though the latter might not exclude the former , the former has no meaning for the latter .

		So too of Dr.
Carus	PERSON	' '' God . ''

		The monist
Haeckel	PERSON	, incorrigible atheist , wrote him , '' We mean the same thing . ''

		And
Carus	PERSON	was never able to make it clear to me that
Haeckel	PERSON	was not right intellectually .

		The term is possibly justified only when we meditate certain human factors outside logical analysis ; and these factors are at the root of the good -LRB- or the evil -RRB- in the use of many old words for new views .

		The
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 455 symbol '' God , '' born of a deep racial instinct of wonder and aspiration and dependence on the order of nature , and rendered trebly sacred by the long human history so intertwined with it , saves for us an attitude , an emotion , an imaginative moment , that the logically correct '' norms of existence '' can never have ; and
Carus	PERSON	' attitude of reverence and love and dedication to the logos may be truer to the sources and the ends of man 's life than the defiantly '' scientific '' attitude we associate , rightly or wrong - ly , with the author of
The Riddle of the Universe	ORGANIZATION	.


Paul Carus	PERSON	, like so many men of his generation , suffered the spiritual tragedy of a household faith in ruins ; and the waves swept him far out to sea .

		But he was a young and vigorous swimmer , and wrestled in the da ^ k .

		He found shore in a new faith of science , far from all old doorwavs .

		But the old emotional attitude , the old imaginative moment had not altered .

		So it came , I think , that he felt with a peculiar poignancy and depth , not amenable even to his own versatile argument and not communi - cable in any speech , the religious quality of what is logically speaking , a system of impersonal laws , infinite in time and space and achieving self - consciousness -LRB- as far as we know -RRB- only through one moment of eternity on one small planet of one of millions of suns in the life of that creature whose destiny it is to transmute cosmic process into cosmic reason a destiny to which
Paul Carus	PERSON	himself so nobly bore witness , and to which the masters of the earth today , not only in
Paris	LOCATION	, seem so trag - ically , so ominously , indifferent .

ELLERY LEONARD	PERSON	.

		The - Impending Revolution in
Italy	LOCATION	THE SUDDEN and unexpected breaking out of the European war in
1914	DATE	Italy was just passing through a very hard and critical period of unrest , as a consequence of the victorious but difficult strug - gle In
Tripoli	LOCATION	against
Turkey	LOCATION	.

		The Italian prol < f - tariat has never approved and was never willing to start any colonial enterprise , on account of its own backward social conditions .

		The colonial wars al - ways left
Italy	LOCATION	crushed under a burden of heavy taxation .

		The working classes , spurred and upheld by their sense of solidarity and of their own common interests , warned the government of the danger that its policy was precipitating upon the whole nation , sending it in the direction of new ruins and disas - ters .

		But even the young kingdom of
Italy	LOCATION	had in itself and had fomented in others the imperialistic desires that are common to kingdoms .

		It had visions of a larger country and new lands to exploit .

		From the point of view of the new and audacious financial and industrial classes of northern
Italy	LOCATION	this policy might have been excusable , but central and southern
Italy	LOCATION	are poor and industrially , agriculturally , and financially undeveloped .

		Besides this , the taxation system of
Italy	LOCATION	is a most unjust one , both in its sys - tem and in its administration .

		The average per capita rate of contribution to the budget of the government is greater in central and southern
Italy	LOCATION	than in the more prosperous north .

		This want of equilibrium in the system of taxation inevitably results in a simi - larly unbalanced ratio of benefits from the govern - ment .


Italy	LOCATION	is absolutely dependent upon outside coun - tries .

		Its resources grain , cotton , coal , and iron are needed for the industries of the country itself .

		Yet before its entry into the great war
Italy	LOCATION	im - ported more than a billion of francs more value than its exports amounted to .

		It was on the market , a cus - tomer of
Germany	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Austria-Hun	PERSON	- gary , and of the
United States	LOCATION	, and if these nations ever closed their market
Italy	LOCATION	would be strangled in a very short time .

		Therefore , because of its geograph - ical position , its financial and industrial needs , and further because of its political and traditional ties of sympathy with
England	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	`` entered the war , '' bargaining '' for the best of her '' sacro egoismo . ''

		The beginning of this war found
Italy	LOCATION	already at the point of exhaustion as a result of the
Tripoli	LOCATION	war , which cost over a billion lire .

		The working classes were absolutely opposed to any further war venture and they went into the fight grudgingly , their hearts filled with resentment .

		The protests of the Socialist party were unheard .

		Violence , corruption , excep - tional laws conquered every opposition .


Italy	LOCATION	had to fight .


Italy	LOCATION	, the country that had for years opposed any real program of reform in favor of the working people , using as her excuse the meagerness of her treasury , now threw millions and millions of dol - lars into a war to realize her dreams of revenge and territorial aggrandizement .

		During four years
Italy	LOCATION	has suffered as no other country .

		She de - stroyed the best of her human stock , she destroyed her forests , her farms , abandoned all her public works , especially in the south , and stripped of every - thing of value her already miserable peasants who , more than any other class , gave to the war their blood and their resources .

		The public debt which 45 6 THE DIAL
May 3	DATE	was fifteen billions of lire before the war is to - day seventy-five billions of lire .

		Three-fourths of the national wealth , which is estimated at one hun - dred billions of lire , is mortgaged .

		The interest alone on her debt , at the rate of four per cent , will cost
Italy	LOCATION	three billions of lire annually .

		Let us take statistics from the official records of the coun - try in normal times , just preceding the war .

		Year Revenues Expenditures Surplus Peficit -LRB- lire -RRB- -LRB- lire -RRB- -LRB- lire -RRB- -LRB- lire -RRB- 1909-10 2,237,260,000 2,204,960,000 32,300,000 1910-11 2,403,390,000 2,391,820,000 11,570,000 1911-12 2,475,350,000 2,587,180,000 111,830,000 1912-13 2,528,870,000 2,786,370,000 257,500,000 1913-14 2,523,750,000 2,687,660,000 163,910,000 The question which arises spontaneously on the lips of every person of common sense who reads these figures is : How can
Italy	LOCATION	pay the interest on her debts ?

		-LRB- Many of them are contracted with foreign countries . -RRB-

		Here is a nation in an absolutely unique situation , not to be compared with that of any other country in the world .


Italy	LOCATION	has no gold , no raw material , no superabundant capital , no great world-famed captains of industry .

		Her only wealth is a thrifty , intelligent , and productive peasantry , and of this wealth she has an abundant store , with a great reservoir of natural strength and ability , which will play a great part in the building of a new society .


Italy	LOCATION	's central government has been for the
past half century	DATE	, \ vith few exceptions , formed of men entirely unfit for any public office .

		They are usually appointed from or chosen by groups of parliamen - tary camarillas who represent petty bourgeois pro- vincial interests .

		Never in this time has there been a man of large vision who could see or outline a consistent Italian policy , a democratic policy .

		The
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	has been an obedient and manageable instrument in the hands of the Conservative party , and it is lately in the hands of the
Free Masons	ORGANIZATION	.

		The kings of
Italy	LOCATION	swung from reaction to a hypo - critical ostentation of democracy .

		The actual ruler , very shortsightedly forgetting the teachings of past history and events , assumed for himself the right to throw
Italy	LOCATION	into the war .

		So in ignoring the
Socialist Party	ORGANIZATION	, the Confedera - zione del Lavoro , and the Unione Sindacale Italiana the government , the statesmen , the king , the parties , pushed
Italy	LOCATION	over the brink of an abyss , for - getting everything but the war , neither understand - ing nor trying to understand the real feelings and conditions of the working classes .

		Even the pro- posed and hotly discussed great reform of '' The Land to the Peasants '' can no longer seduce the working classes .

		They know too well that this re - form does not abolish the private rights of property but changes only its management , leaving to the proprietor the right of living off the land .

		Nor can the returning soldiers be omitted from the equation .

		At the front ` they heard of useless sacrifices of their comrades , due to faults and mistakes of their com - mandants .

		When they return they find themselves and their families and villages in desperate plight , helpless , penniless , hungry , suffering .

		They wander like ghosts , cursing the responsible ''
Signori	PERSON	'' who wanted the dreadful war .

		The situation in southern
Italy	LOCATION	is terrible , no less .

		` Here the peasants depend mostly upon the products of agriculture .

		Right here one strikes the first spirit of revolt .

		The peasants ' psychology is very simple , direct , clear , and because of its very simplicity is in a position to interpret and understand society and the relation of the peasant to '' higher authority . ''

		They have been told for years that the defeat of the '' ancient enemy '' would bring freedom and prosperity to the poorer classes .

		They have , ordinarily , no interest in political matters .

		But as soon as they perceive that they have been duped , used , deceived by false promises , they go back in their minds and memories to other disastrous adven - tures the Abysinnian War ,
Tripoli	LOCATION	and they realize that it is but the same tragic story in a new - cloak .

		And they need but to realize this to become spon - taneously and immediately revolutionists .

		They see men who a few years ago were without a span of land and who today are rich .

		How ?

		Why ?

		All their own sufferings , like the clouds before a storm , gather in their exasperated brains , and it is but a step from that point to open violence .

		In
1894	DATE	dur - ing the bloody revolts of Sicily the peasant vented his hatred upon the little stations of the municipal im - port duty , thinking that these were the culprits who were to blame for all his unendurable misery .

		He can not be so deceived again .

		Now he experiences all the different stages of moral , mental , and physical crises war , death , disease , hunger , grief , privations and his heart burns for justice , for human sym - pathy , for solidarity .

		And the industrial worker of northern and cen - tral
Italy	LOCATION	shares the resentment of his brother in the south .

		What matters it that he has made money out of the war , because of the higher wages , when there has been no food in the markets for himself and his family ?

		And in addition the proletarians of the large cities have found during the war that there are organizations for their benefit , class or - ganizations , the Socialist party , and he has learned to trust them .

		Here is the kernel of the matter .

		It can not be denied that the labor organizations and the Socialist party are the only hope of the Italinn workers .

		No other party or faction or group from the Conservatives to the Republicans , from the Catholics to the Democrats , has the confidence and
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 457 support of the working masses .

		The Socialist party , with its uncompromising attitude , composed of men fearless , honest , combative , every moment in close touch with the workingmen , has the key of the whole situation .

		A few weeks ago in
Milan	LOCATION	, the greatest indus - trial center of
Italy	LOCATION	, at a meeting of thousands of workers organized to protest against the holding of political prisoners and to demand the evacuation 6f Italian troops from
Russia	LOCATION	, a Socialist representa - tive defined the situation sharply and clearly , amidst thunders of applause from the crowds . ''

		The Italian bourgeoisie is bankrupt .

		The state which represents it is bankrupt .

		It matters not that bank - ruptcy has not been declared .

		It exists .

		Every public service in the state is disorganized .

		Un - employment is growing .

		There is nothing to meet and face the needs of the people .

		The state and the bourgeoisie have no solution . ''

		-LRB- Voice : `` It is true .

		We need revolution . '' -RRB- ''

		Even if
Italy	LOCATION	has won a military victory by sacrificing a half-million of its workers , it has been defeated economically .

		Our problem now is to feed the people , and the bourgeoisie can not feed them .

		Only if the revolution in
Russia	LOCATION	, in
Germany	LOCATION	, in
Austria	LOCATION	succeeds will it be possible to obtain food from the
East	LOCATION	. ''

		Such is the plain expression ' of the men who will be in the saddle of the new
Italy	LOCATION	tomorrow .

		No other remedy can be successful .

		The giving to
Italy	LOCATION	of all she demands from the
Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	will not change by a hair 's breadth the swing of the pendulum of her fate .

		A country of many revolutionary traditions , in the most precarious social unrest , party strife ; a mass of people held under the most brutal iron heel of military discip - line for the past four years ; with revolutionary parties who unceasingly spealc , write , organize , and incite the workers and the peasants to solidarity ,
Italy	LOCATION	is at a crucial hour of a great revolution .

		No magician has yet arisen to avert the social deluge .

		The Montagu-Chelmsford Reform Proposals XTLs IN EVERY OTHER COUNTRY , so in
India	LOCATION	eco - nomic factors play a predominant part in the politi - cal situation .

		Any constitutional reform proposal to be of any practical value to the people should solve economic grievances in a way satisfactory to them with an eye to their real interests , and not to the interests of a few special or '' kept '' classes .

		To understand the effect which the new
Montagu	PERSON	-
Chelmsford Reform Report	ORGANIZATION	, if adopted , will have upon the Indian masses , it is necessary to study the economic side of the proposal .

		The extent to which the proposed reforms embodied in this scheme will benefit
India	LOCATION	's millions is really the extent of its value .

		Throughout the whole of this record , admir - able for its bulk , its excellent English , and its clever - ness , there are few provisions for solving the eco - nomic needs of
India	LOCATION	needs which are vital to the peace and tranquillity of the people and the country .

		The document abounds in changes ; but they are merely political changes , with checks and counter - checks , limitations and provisos , and the authors seem entirely lacking in ability to discern and un - derstand the real economic problems of the people , the solution of which is more necessary than the in - crease of a carefully chosen electorate , or similar purely political institutions .

		Where the report touches , or can be construed to touch , the economic problem , it is found that the whole function of the proposed reform is to safeguard a few special interests .

		Or , to quote directly from the report , `` to protect capital , credit , and indeed property , with - out discrimination . ''


India	LOCATION	is at present an agricultural country .

		It possesses a phenomenally fertile soil .

		It has an area of about 1,820,000 square miles , or about two-thirds that of the
United Sjtates	ORGANIZATION	.

		Still almost two-thirds of its population are supported directly by agricul - ture and the subordinate industry of cattle raising .

		If the number indirectly supported by these indus - tries be included , the proportion dependent upon them would rise to nine-tenths .

		In the
United States	LOCATION	the proportion dependent upon agriculture , directly and indirectly , is only three-tenths of the entire population .

		In other words , because of scien - tific methods , modern implements , and a broader education , an American farmer does the w r ork of six Indian ryots -LRB- farmers -RRB- .

		One would naturally expect that any reform con - ceived for
India	LOCATION	would be executed on behalf of this vast peasant class .

		Yet nowhere in the new .

		reform scheme is there mention of any change which might improve its conditions .

		Under the proposed reforms , Indians natives of the land , owners of the soil of
India	LOCATION	are granted more voice in the legislative bodies .

		If the representatives of the people , sitting in legislative bodies , attempt to solve problems arising out of their own domestic affairs in a manner which may make
India	LOCATION	more of an in - dustrial and less of an agricultural country a pro- cedure which wourd be for
India	LOCATION	's benefit or if 458 THE DIAL
May 3	DATE	they should attempt innovations which might be em - barrassing to the supreme authority of the
British Government	ORGANIZATION	, the Governor-General in
Council	ORGANIZATION	is given the power to intervene and to veto such a move , on the plea that it `` threatens the stability of the country . ''

		Article V of the Summary of Rec - ommendations , which follows , will be the strong veto weapon in the hands of the Governor-General : The Government of
India	LOCATION	-LSB- is -RSB- to preserve indisput - able authority adjudged by it to be essential in the dis - charge of its responsibilities for peace , order , and good government .

		The following quotation , also taken from the re - port , further gives the attitude of the supreme authority in the land toward the people subject to it : And while we do everything that we can to encourage Indians to settle their own problems for themselves , we -LSB- the Governor-General in
Council	ORGANIZATION	-RSB- must retain power to restrain them from seeking to do so in a way that would threaten to destroy the stability of the coun - try ... He , -LSB- the ryot -RSB- , must not be exposed to the risk of oppression by people who are stronger and cleverer than he is , and until it is clear that his inter - ests can safely be left in his own hands , or that the legis - lative council represents and considers his interests , we must retain power to protect him .

		Or , in other words , the authors of the scheme believe , or seem to believe that , unlike the represen - tatives of any self-governing country , the represen - tative of the people of
India	LOCATION	are incapable of look - ing after the interests of the Indian peasants , while they , the British , are above criticism in this respect .

		The quotation further infers that the Indian rep - resentatives do not represent the ryot or consider their interests .

		Yet this would not be true if the franchise were granted to other than selected groups whose representatives are incapable , as are the Brit - ish themselves , of considering the interests of any save themselves .

		It is a clever political reform which says : `` You do not represent the people , and we re - fuse to give you the power to do so .

		But we have the power and we are , therefore , capable of this benevolent duty . ''

		But just what sort of interest in the peasant class the alien rulers possess may readily be inferred from a study of the economic policy of British rule in
India	LOCATION	, as well as from the recommendations em - bodied in Chapters 344 , 345 , and 346 , which con - cern themselves with special classes and interests .

		The economic policy which obtains in
India	LOCATION	has re - duced the country to the status of `` a hewer of wood and drawer of water , '' an expression used by Mr.
Austen Chamberlain	PERSON	, the ex-Secretary of
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		All Indian industries and handicrafts have been ruined by restrictive and repressive measures , both political and economical ; industrial backwardness has always been fostered and encouraged in the interests of British manufacturers ; the countervailing excise duty on locally manufactured cotton goods , and the maintenance of a
Stores Department	ORGANIZATION	at the
India Office	ORGANIZATION	in
London	LOCATION	, are eloquent symbols of the ex - ploiting economic policy of the administrators who now profess to hold so close to their hearts the wel - fare of the Indian ryot .

		Though ... the standard of living among the peasant class has improved perceptibly of late years , there is still no great margin of taxable capacity , -LSB- Italics mine . -RSB-

		This sentence from the report again exposes the kind of concern in the peasant held by the governing class .

		The governing class has but one interest , and that is to levy taxes .

		Witness the confession that the ryot is today taxed to his fullest possible capac - ity .

		This in itself is sufficient condemnation of an administration which has brought such unspeakable poverty .

		Yet the authors of the reform scheme are searching for new sources of revenue of taxation .

		While thus searching they have turned their eyes to industrial development , which is the prime source of revenue in modern , self-governing countries .

		Practically every well-poised , up-to-date country in the world has a fiscal policy which , in one way or the other , fosters home industries through pro- tective tariffs , dumpings , and subsidies .

		Even the self-governing colonies of the British Empire enjoy this privilege to the full extent .

		Only in
India	LOCATION	is the fiscal policy designed to suppress -LRB- Indian -RRB- in - dustries and handicrafts , and hamper the develop - ment of natural resources all in the interests of English capitalists and manufacturers .


India	LOCATION	's fis - cal policy is dictated from Westminster by a few of the `` kept '' classes ; they are not even the Indian `` kept '' class .

		The authors of the present scheme have come for - ward with a policy for industrial development .

		But even in this they are not as altruistic as may appear on the face of the proposal .

		Both on economic and military grounds , Imperial in - terests also demand that the natural resources of
India	LOCATION	should be better utilized .

		We can not measure the access of strength which an industrialized
India	LOCATION	will bring to the power of the Empire ... The war has thrown a strong light on the military importance of economic development .

		We know that the possibility of sea com - munications being temporarily interrupted , forces us to rely on
India	LOCATION	, as an ordnance base for protective opera - tions for eastern theatres of war .

		Herein lies the true reason for the avowed `` forward policy '' :
India	LOCATION	is strategically needed for a military and ordnance base for operations in the
East	LOCATION	.

		As nowadays the products of an industrially developed community coincide so nearly `` in kind , though not in quantity , with the catalogue of munitions of war , '' so the authors of the scheme are concerned with an industrialized
India	LOCATION	not for the interests THE DIAL 459 of
India	LOCATION	however , but as an asset of strength '' to the Empire for Imperial interests . ''

		The great in - ternational importance of
India	LOCATION	is thus revealed : in the past converted into a producer of raw mate - rial for a special purpose ; in the future , converted into an industrialized country , not for its own de - velopment , but to be used as a base for an
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	theater of war .

		And a war for whom and for what ?

		Perhaps the world will be told that it is to save
India	LOCATION	from subjugation by a foreign power !

		Will
India	LOCATION	be allowed to have measures of pro- tective tariffs for the development and protection of its own industries ?

		Not according to the report if , by so doing ,
India	LOCATION	jeopardizes the interests of British manufacturers .

		It must not be allowed `` to penalize imported articles without respect of ori - gin '' meaning , of course , those of British origin .

		To safeguard this phase of tariff regulations in other words , to safeguard British manufactured articles the Governor-General in
Council	ORGANIZATION	retains absolute veto power over tariff measures passed by the representatives of
India	LOCATION	in their
Legislative Council	ORGANIZATION	.

		For political expediency and military necessity the
Government	ORGANIZATION	will act as guide in the development of natural resources , but these must be subjected to the interests of the British Empire .

		In - dia 's development is to be , not for her own advance - ment , protection , and gain , but only so far as is needed for the interests of the Empire for `` strength - ening
India	LOCATION	's connection with the Empire . ''


India	LOCATION	exists for the interests of the Empire and must serve as needed and directed , and not in her own way !

		The reform proposals also give the Governor - General in
Council	ORGANIZATION	absolute veto power over meas - ures passed by the
Legislative Council	ORGANIZATION	, which might be looked upon with disfavor by certain special in - terests , such as the European community , the
Chris	PERSON	- tian missions , the Eurasian community , each of which belongs to what
Thorstein Veblen	PERSON	, in a re - cent issue of THE DIAL , has styled `` kept classes , '' and the class of `` vested interests . ''

		The authors of the scheme seem to be particularly anxious to safeguard the interests of the non-official European community .

		In main , this class is engaged in com - mercial enterprises , but it also includes Christian missions , whose dignitaries , unlike those of other religious denominations , are supported by Indian taxpayers from Indian revenues .

		The non-official European community also includes European pen - sioners living in the `` cooler parts of the country . ''

		It is the British commercial interests that drain the country of the wealth which ought to be retained .

		But again , lest
India	LOCATION	's representatives raise a voice in their Legislature against this unjust drain , the Governor-General in
Council	ORGANIZATION	retains the absolute power to keep this drain a-fiowing .

		The report states : It is our duty to reserve to the Government the power to protect any industry from prejudicial attack or priv - ileged competition .

		Here , again ,
India	LOCATION	will be allowed to develop her industries only in a way such as will safeguard `` vested interests . ''

		These `` vested interests '' must be protected from prejudicial attack or privileged competition .

		All the power and force of the alien administration is there to look after the good be - havior of
India	LOCATION	's representatives .

		The missionaries and the Eurasian community have long been indi - rectly , if not directly , encouraged by the theory df absolutism to inculcate in the illiterate masses ideas of their inferiority .

		The authors of the present scheme , therefore , are determined to protect the in - terests of these communities against `` impositions '' by the representatives of
India	LOCATION	which might jeopardize their privileged positions .

		Imperialism in
India	LOCATION	, as well as in every other country outside of
Japan	LOCATION	, assumes as its first tenet the superiority of white rulers , and every precaution is taken in the new reform scheme to perpetuate this theory .

		Any action taken by
India	LOCATION	's representatives to challenge this assumption will face the supreme veto power of the Governor-General .

		Taken as a whole , the Montagu-Chelmsford Re - port is almost entirely political in scope ; but even then it has not met the very moderate political de - mands of the
Indian National Congress	ORGANIZATION	and the
All India Muslim League	ORGANIZATION	.

		It has been forced by the growth of the separatist movement in
India	LOCATION	.

		This latter movement owes its origin as much to economic injustice , economic inequalities , and eco - nomic exploitation as to political injustice .


India	LOCATION	's grievances have been accumulating for a century ; they have given birth to the separatist movement .

		The reform proposal hopes to solve these problems ; yet every safeguard is used to maintain the status quo in the policy of economic exploitation .

		Political concessions without economic reform will count for little in
India	LOCATION	.

		The economic situa - tion is the root cause of political difficulties , and economic grievances create political grievances .

		Un - less these problems are solved in time , in the right way , a political and social upheaval may be the re - sult .

		But reforms offered should not be half - hearted , suspicious adventures , the purpose of which is to emasculate opposition without meeting the de - mands of
India	LOCATION	and solving the root cause of agitation .


India	LOCATION	presents this reform bill in entirety to the world and wishes to know if this is what is meant by the expressions `` self-determination '' and `` un - Jictated self-development '' of nations .

		460 THE DIAL
May 3	DATE	The Passing of Classicism I N THE REPUBLIC of letters a book ought to have good reason for existing it would simplify life incalculably for all readers , and make the lives of uninspired writers much less irksome .

		And yet Mr.
Cox	PERSON	unreasonably insists that it is the obvious that is ever being forgotten or denied , and therefore the obvious that needs constant reassertion .

		Such a claim sums up the merciless raison-d'etr ' e of a book Concerning Painting , -LRB- Scribner -RRB- no less indifferent for having been carefully written .

		It is accordingly a clarification rather than a contribution , a sheaf of occasional and consecutive papers on the history of painting , originally addressed to an immature public of students , and amateurs .

		Guarded as its preten - sions are , it is neither free from pedantry nor com - placence .

		In fact our author sails down the dim centuries , past what he calls '' the golden age , '' into the placid shallows of American painting , altogether like a vessel of sweetness and light , distributing his gifts generously , but seldom illuminating the dark - ness .

		Yet it would be ungracious not to add that Mr.
Cox	PERSON	came to his subject with special qualifications .

		If not a constructive thinker , he was sane and cir - cumspect , unlikely to slip up on external details , while he kept safe and warm within him the invio - lable principles .

		of his solemn esthetic .

		He was one of the few artistic practitioners who had mature convictions about painting .

		He was one of a very small number of writers upon art in whom an easy and innocent public reposed its ultimate remnant of faith , because he was at the same time a craftsman .

		But and it is here that the obvious pleads for reassertion the activities of art and criticism are profoundly antinomian and disparate , and each must forever remain prejudicial to the other .

		A prudent
Providence	LOCATION	has given the painter freedom of all the fruits of his boundless paradise but denied him that of the knowledge of what is good and what is bad .

		For the concern of the artist is chiefly with an opera - tion , that of the critic with a result that of the one with the mechanics of externalization , that of the other with the consummation .

		What the artist creates by a vital act of imaginative synthesis the critic reconstructs by imaginative sympathy .

		His function involves a greater variety of faculties , and the ideal critic is accordingly put together of high susceptibilities , range and freedom of the imagina - tion , and a clear gift for self-analysis .

		He is '' pro- tean '' and expansive .

		He is also learned and dis - cerning .

		His delicate business is to interpret a work of art through infinitely fluid , responsive emotions .

		But the adventure as well as the history of the painter is intensive , individual , and constraining .

		His style evolves by a process of involution ; by re - ciprocal confinement and consolidation of the crea - tive materials ; by bringing the pictorial idea , the pictorial symbol , and the pictorial performance into close cooperation .

		The more nearly complete this in - ner alliance , the more individual the creative ele - ments , the more intense their activity , the more deep - ly determined his taste .

		It will , consequently , bias his judgment .

		For in the episode of stylistic formation the painter drifts into orthodoxies of his own , with private ritual and private dread of heresy .

		The objects of his idolatry may even be predicted .

		He may be counted on to look for his own reflection in the works of others , and his chest will swell with pious exaltation before works that betray similar procedure or aims kindred to his own .

		The insulation of taste and of standards is the result partly of defensory measures the conscientious individual must take against the quantitative ideal of modern civilization .

		In the day when the aver - age mind was of a more imaginative order and each separate communal world rejoiced in common intel - lectual and spiritual possessions , as in the Italian Renaissance for example , the individual was shaped by the total growth of culture and society ; and the painter 's taste , with its roots in the genius of his people and his time , was indeed typical and authori - tative .

		But in this age , and in our country most of all , the creative activities encounter great difficulties .

		In the dearth of acknowledged norms , of early standardized training , with an unkindly or indif - ferent or insensible world spinning round him , the artist avdws no higher authority than his own , and his taste must contract until it becomes personal and eccentric .

		With Mr.
Cox	PERSON	taste had settled into something like fastidiousness , received the vesture of a formula and the glorification of a canon .

		Being what is vulgarly called a '' classicist , '' his canon would have been the canon of correctness .

		And as he followed it in his painting , he could not have failed to apply it to the painting of others .

		It is as easy to guess that our egregious author found the embodiment of his '' canonized '' ideal in the academic genius of
Leonardo	LOCATION	,
Raphael	PERSON	,
Rubens	PERSON	, and a group of painters more nearly of our own time , who like himself have covered beautiful wall-spaces with ineffably tire - some decorations .

		As his position was essentially uncritical , so his method was shallow , traditional , and dogmatic .

		In IQI9 THE DIAL 461 a philosophic exordium Mr.
Cox	PERSON	set himself to abstract from the history of art and what he was pleased to decide are its eras of greatest progress its eternal characteristics , and he was persuaded that from its first appearance painting has been an art of representation .

		No theory could both for its tradition and its plausibility be more flattering .

		It has all the sanctions of logic .

		Does not our whole system of imagery derive from the objects of natural life ?

		They constitute the icdnography of the mind and become , by necessity , the notation in which painting realizes itself .

		Only be it remem - bered that ever since the days of Cubism much of painting has dispensed with natural forms , a matter which Mr.
Cox	PERSON	noted in his argument but chose to ignore in his conclusions .

		This is not treating his - tory ingenuously .

		For the contemporary movements are no less a parcel of evolution than those that have gone before .

		But Mr.
Cox	PERSON	thought more of rolling up a high score by careful dialectic than by sympathetic reading of artistic evolution .

		Having , as he thought , satisfied the historic and inductive part of his discussion , he proceeded to formulate the ethics of art from a knowledge of what painting is , it is only one logical step to what it should be , and Mr.
Cox	PERSON	surpassed himself when he told us with staggering composure that what is historically true -LRB- according to his lights -RRB- must be esthetically right .

		The viciousness of this view is only too obvious .

		As well might our standards of conduct be deduced from the conduct of men in the past .

		Standards of judgment in art , like the standards of right and wrong in ethics , must ulti - mately derive from the individuality of the object or the circumstance .

		Each work of art carries within it its own law , its own standard , its own esthetic , exactly as each is the product of different internal and external conditions .

		His original assumption once established , that art is measurable by unchanging rule , he found it easy to pass to the elementary fallacy that art like science has knowable and calculable characters ; and he spoke with amusing innocence of '' progress in art '' as if art , like the sciences , advanced by a sort of cumulative growth of artistic excellence .

		But such a view would drag us to the preposterous conclusion that the art of Titian is greater than that of
Giotto	ORGANIZATION	, that of Ingres greater than that of
Raphael	PERSON	, and Mr.
Cox	PERSON	's by inevitable inference , the greatest of them all .

		And even were that so , his reputation as a painter should have as little to do with the value of his critical pronouncements as the marvelous con - structions of a mole , let us say , with the value of his opinions on architecture .

		But it is neither by his art nor by his criticism that Mr.
Cox	PERSON	will be remem - bered , but as an angel of dead perfections , who has bravely set his face against the intolerable beauty of many things in art that are strange or violent or merely beautiful .

OFFNER	PERSON	.

		The
Army	ORGANIZATION	and The Law o N JANUARY 3
George T. Page	PERSON	, President of the
American Bar Association	ORGANIZATION	, brought up the sub - ject of court-martials before the body , and a resolu - tion was adopted condemning the entire judiciary process of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	as `` unworthy of law and jus - tice . ''

		A bill known as
Senate Bill No.	ORGANIZATION	8.5320 was introduced by Senator
Chamberlain	PERSON	on
January 13 , 1919	DATE	, asking for the revision of the war acts relat - ing to the administration of military justice .

		As the result of disclosures and insistent demands by friends of the conscientious objectors confined in the
Camp Funston Guard House	ORGANIZATION	, two officers were dismissed from the service for the responsibility they bore for the brutal treatment accorded to the imprisoned conscientious objectors .

		The
New York World	LOCATION	, in its issue of
January 19 , 1919	DATE	, under the title A
Thing Called Military Justice	ORGANIZATION	, relates the story of men ordered to be shot in
France	LOCATION	, the sentence being mainly based on induced confessions of the men themselves .

		The charge was sleeping while on sentinel post and the record disclosed such irregulari - ties that the sentences were rescinded by the
Secre	PERSON	- tary of War and the men liberated .

		Both in the army and the navy men were en - trusted with the administration of military justice and penalization , with little regard for their mental equipment or qualifications for these important posi - tions .

		Officiousness , stupidity , brutality prevailed side by side with the apparent humaneness and fair - ness of the Secretary of War and his immediate as - sociates .

		Outside the army , men who were loudest in their denunciation of the Prussian theory of `` mili - tary necessity '' excused these * irregularities because maxim of benighted medieval pirates inter < arma lex silet .

		Of specific instances of injustice there is hardly an end .

		No account seems to have been taken by the officers of the fact that the drafted men were sons of freemen unaccustomed to the iron-clad arbi - trary discipline of the life into which they were sud - denly cast .

		The conscripts , taken from their fami - lies , were expected to imbibe the spirit of unques - tioning obedience over night .

		The offenses for 462 THE DIAL
May 3	DATE	which severe punishments were administered were entirely out of proportion to the penalties .

		It can - not be said that the system was `` for the good of the service . ''

		The experience of
France	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	proves the contrary .

		The punishment in the
Ameri	LOCATION	- can cantonments was administered with Puritan solemnity and the severity disclosed the inexperience of the amateur penologists .

		The officers were evi - dently impressed with the fact that they were a principio soldiers and incidentally human beings .

		A man in the guard house was like one who had stained the hem of the cloister robe .

		There was none of the jolliness and wink-of-the-eye camara - derie of
Tommy Atkins	PERSON	while in the guard house : But I 've had my fun of the
Corp	ORGANIZATION	` ral 's Guard ; I 've made the cinders fly , And I 'm here in the Clink for a thundering drink And blackening the
Corporal	ORGANIZATION	's eye .

		A plausible explanation may well be that there is a Freudian reason for the severity which officers of court-martials exercised on men claiming to be con - scientious objectors .

		Men who voted for and elected a President because he had '' kept them out of war '' were required to become staunchest martinets almost within a fortnight .

		But most of the severity was due to inexperience .

		An artist doing police kitchen work `` bossed '' by a non-commissioned bootblack and court-martialed by a furniture salesman , drug clerk , small-town newspaper man , and the like .

		Such was this strange world of topsy-turvy .

		The military law of the
United States	LOCATION	preserves its archaic spirit in which our characteristic unpre - paredness found us at the beginning of the war .

		While the Congressional investigation into the sani - tary and medical conditions in the camps , made at the very beginning of the war , disclosed culpable laxity and negligence and resulted in immediate re - form , no such action was taken in relation to judica - ture or penal institutions .

		The entire system was originated by
Lieber	PERSON	in the Civil War and in normal times of peace was found to be ample in regulating a comparatively small body of volunteers .

		With practically no important changes the War Act -LRB- Act of
1917	DATE	-RRB- was applied to an army of millions of con - scripts .

		A book , therefore , dealing with the law and the army written by a lawyer should prove a welcome and timely contribution .

		Unfortunately Mr.
Gerrard Glenn	PERSON	's The
Army	ORGANIZATION	and the Law -LRB-
Columbia University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , fails in this im - portant task .

		It is not a criticism , nor is it sug - gestive of any reforms .

		It may be argued that the disbanding of our army will make these changes purely academic .

		That were a wished-for consum - mation .

		But many men are still languishing in jail serving almost ; lifetime sentences for incommensurate trespasses , some sentences imposed because of the caprice of a newly commissioned smart young officer .

		Men are still being court-martialed .

		The entire penal system is a disgrace to the nation .

		But the author 's `` avowed purpose , '' it may be said , is not so broad ; he merely sets out to interpret the rela - tion of the army to the common law , < md has here no business with the army organization per se .

		Even in this narrow sphere , Mr.
Glenn	PERSON	is merely pro- mulgatory .

		No mention is made of the numerous invasions made by the army and
navy Intelligence Officers	ORGANIZATION	into private homes where they seized per - sonal effects and made searches without warrants .

		The notorious `` slacker raid '' in
New York City	LOCATION	and elsewhere , in which the army played such an important part , is avoided .

		The illegal drafting of aliens , Russians with or without '' first papers , '' the drafting of Austrians and even Germans are not treated .

		The case of Angellus vs.
Sullivan	PERSON	is inade - quately referred to .

		No account is given of the de - batable proposition of `` desertion '' by drafted men who fail to report .

		The book is a learned legal dissertation citing numerous historic references but totally devoid of suggestions which would displease the army author - ities .

		Its proper repository is the Academy at
West Point	LOCATION	, which we all hope will some day be turned into a
National Museum	ORGANIZATION	.

		Otherwise it will make a valuable addition to the overcrowded library - shelves of the law schools , where the students may hurriedly read the title some time .

		But ours are the days of quick changes .

		Even the venerable lore of Metternichian diplomacy has been taught that its usefulness as a humanity-serving institution has gone by the board .

		The democracies of the world will insist that martial law lose the spirit of the middle ages .


Blackstone	ORGANIZATION	,
Hume	PERSON	,
Coke	ORGANIZATION	, Dicey , and
Lieber	PERSON	may be interesting to historians and brief-writers , but books on law and the army should be broad , pro- gressive , and constructive outlines , not merely retrospective dissertations .

		Within its proper limits the book demonstrates a conscientious purpose and painstaking labor and a well-grounded knowledge of the subject matter with which it deals .

		Its chosen field is well covered and it is replete with in - teresting historical incidents .

		It is to be regretted that the author elected not to view so important a matter as the army and the law from the broader , social , economic , and internationalist viewpoint .

		His audience must necessarily be limited and it is an audience which is incapable of appreciation of the labor which goes into the making of the small volume .

		THE DIAL 463 Mary in
Wonderland 1VJ	LOCATION	.

		ARY ARNOLD was the child of the Victorian family a large family of grown-ups but only one child .

		At least the impression which A Writer 's Recollections -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- gives us is that of a little girl who sits on the knees of innumerable parents , grandparents , uncles , aunts , and mature cousins , and asks questions , or plays contentedly by herself on the hearth a quiet , demure child , serious and attentive , with nice manners and no taste for mischief or dis - concerting sense of humor .

		She must have been a delight to her elders .

		She took the toys which they handed to her the higher criticism , the higher education of women , the polite philanthropy of the
University Settlement	ORGANIZATION	, the improving card games of society , scholarship , arts , and letters .

		She never wanted a boy 's toy , like the vote and did n't want other little girls to have it either .

		Oh , she must have been a delight to those elders so fresh , and bright , and naive , and
Thomas Humphry Ward	PERSON	to the contrary maidenly .

		Her Recollections are like a tea-party , a child 's tea-party with everybody for half a century invited and accepting , and all there at once , a party like Alice in
Wonderland	LOCATION	with old
Miss Martineau	PERSON	as the Red Queen crying '' Off with his head , '' and Uncle
Matthew	PERSON	dangling his gloves like the White Rabbit , and
Mark Pattison	PERSON	as the Mad Hatter , complaining that it 's always jam tomorrow and never today , and the Master of Balliol perched on the wall like Humpty Dumpty and little Mary handing round the cakes .

		Some French gentlemen ,
M. Taine and M. Renan	PERSON	, are there too , but of these
Mary	PERSON	is at first a little shy , for her French is not very good .

		There was one terrible figure in the background of the child 's thoughts , and in her playroom a dreadful closet which was not to be opened .

		Her father ,
Thomas Arnold	PERSON	, son of the leader of the Church of
England	LOCATION	against the
Oxford Malignants	ORGANIZATION	, had fallen victim of their arts and become perverted to Roman Catholicism .

		This fact supplied the element of fear without which no child 's game is complete , and the fear was no less real because the author of it pos - sessed such rare and tender charm .

		As a child in
Edgbaston	LOCATION	, where her father was master in the
Oratory School	ORGANIZATION	, she saw the figure of
Newman	PERSON	pass in the streets and '' shrank from him in a dumb childish resentment as from some one whom I under - stood to be the author of our family misfortunes . ''

		And she never escaped the sense of
Newman	PERSON	's mys - terious power and subtle charm , the old childish fear lending a kind of fascination to her thought of him .

		At
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, whither her father took her on his temporary reversion to Anglicanism , she felt the presence of the lost leader , felt it in the intellectual life of the
University	ORGANIZATION	which was a battle in which
Christ Church	ORGANIZATION	represented authority and the church ,
Balliol	LOCATION	, liberalism , and
Lincoln	LOCATION	, science and re - search ; in
University	ORGANIZATION	politics which were a struggle between
Pusey	PERSON	and
Liddon	PERSON	on the one hand and
Jowett	PERSON	and
Pattison	PERSON	on the other .

		Liddon had suc - ceeded
Newman	PERSON	as the pulpit orator of the
Tractar	PERSON	- ians and vividly she recalls the scene of his triumph ^ First came the stir of the procession ; the long line of Heads of Houses in their scarlet robes as Doctors of Divinity all but the two heretics ,
Pattison	PERSON	and
Jowett	PERSON	, who walked in plain black and warmed my heart always thereby !

		And then the Vice Chancellor , with the '' pokers , '' and the preacher .

		All eyes were fixed on the slender willowy figure , and the dark head touched with silver .

		A bow to the Vice Chancellor as they parted at the foot of the pulpit stairs , the mounting of the pulpit , the quiet look out over the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, the Bidding Prayer , the voice it was all part of an incomparable perform - ance which can not be paralleled today .

		Beside this dignified picture there is a more grac - ious and winning one .

		The leader of feminist Ox - ford was Mrs.
Mark Pattison	PERSON	, afterward Lady Dilke .

		Her lovely apparition on the severe academic scene was a portent which few recognized .

		To the meeting with her Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	gives another vignette , with an indescribable and old world charm : It was in * 1868 or
1869	DATE	I think I was seventeen that I remember mv first sight of a college garden lying cool and shaded between gray college walls , and on the grass a figure that held me fascinated a lady in a green brocade dress , with a belt and chatelaine of Russian silver , who was playing croquet , then a novelty in Ox - ford , and seemed to me as I watched her , a perfect model of grace and vivacity .

		A man nearly thirty years older than herself , whom I knew to be her husband , was standing near her , and a handful of under-graduates made an amused and admiring court round the lady .

		The lady in green brocade playing croquet on the grass the husband thirty years older the amused and admiring undergraduates could anything be more enchantingly of the period ?

		Mrs.
Pattison	PERSON	marked the beginning of feminine influence in
Oxford	LOCATION	as did
Newman	PERSON	the end of monasticism .

		One can divine the breeze which made the leaves of gossip tremble on the
University	ORGANIZATION	tree when she wore a tea gown to her
Sunday	DATE
night	TIME	parties , and smoked a cigarette as a few years be - fore they had rustled when one of
Newman	PERSON	's dis - ciples assumed the eastward position or bowed to God in a Catholic chapel .

		The coming of
George Eliot	PERSON	to
Lincoln College	LOCATION	as her guest was an event that shook the branches as did the return of New - man in his cardinal 's robes to hold high court at
Trinitv	ORGANIZATION	.

		One can divine too the second intention THE DIAL
May 3	DATE	which made Mrs.
Pattison	PERSON	welcome little
Mary Arnold	PERSON	to her salon , though
Mary	PERSON	's evangelical protest took the form of a dark frock high about the throat .

		Perhaps it was this sign that the young girl was in this world but not yet of it that made the
George Eliot	PERSON	hold her back as the party ` was ad - journing , to sit in the darkness and tell her of
Spain	LOCATION	.

		And one more recollection .

		The next day as the party were returning from
Christ Church	ORGANIZATION	meadow they were led by Mr.
Creighton	PERSON	,
Fellow of Merton	ORGANIZATION	, through the gardens of his college .

		The chestnuts were all out , one splendor from top to toe ; the laburnams ; the lilacs ; the hawthorns , red and white ; the new-mown grass spreading its smooth and silky carpet round the college walls ; a
May	DATE	sky over - head and through the trees glimpses of towers and spires , silver gray , in the sparkling
summer	DATE	air .

		... As we turned into the quadrangle of Lincoln suddenly at one of the upper windows of the Rector 's lodgings there appeared the head and shoulders of Mrs.
Pattison	PERSON	, as she looked out and beckoned , smiling , to Mrs.
Lewes	LOCATION	.

		It was a brilliant apparition , as though a French portrait by
Greuze	PERSON	or Perronneau had suddenly slipped into a vacant space in the old college wall .

		The pale , pretty head , blond-cendree ; the delicate , smiling features and white throat ; a touch of black , a touch of blue ; a white dress ; a general eighteenth-century impression as though of powder and patches Mrs.
Lewes	LOCATION	perceived it in a flash and I saw her run eagerly to Mr.
Lewes	PERSON	and draw his attention to the window and its occupant .

		... If she had lived longer , someday , and somewhere in her books , that vision at the window and that flower-laden garden would have reappeared .

		I seemed to see her consciously and deliberately committing both to memory .

		With all her admiration for Mrs.
Pattison	PERSON	it is clear that it was for the Rector that
Mary Arnold	PERSON	kept her devotion , cheering him in the absence of his wife , making tea for him in his lonely rooms .

		Scarcely less intimate and charming was her friend - ship with
Jowett	PERSON	.

		For them and for
Thomas Hill Green	ORGANIZATION	,
Dean Stanley	PERSON	,
Heriry Sidgwick	PERSON	and her uncle
Matt	PERSON	she kept a girlish yet maternal instinct to cherish and protect from the bitter assaults of the Tractarians .

		When Bishop
Wordsworth	PERSON	at - tacked her friends in his
Bampton	LOCATION	lectures she de - fended them in a pamphlet that the High Church party suppressed on the ground that the printer 's name did not appear .

		Under , their inspiration she began to play in earnest .

		Historical scholarship was the great game at Oxford : history touched by the modern scientific method was its newest phase .

		Peo - ple w T ere going about saying that if
Newman	PERSON	had only known German the course of the world would have been different .

		Mary
Arnold	PERSON	began to amuse herself with the West-Gothic kings of
Spain	LOCATION	and then was commissioned to write the Spanish lives for
Smith 's Dictionary of Christian Biography	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Pattison	PERSON	secured her admission to the great gaming tables of the Bodleian , and there she played for her modest stakes and won .

		She relates her consterna - tion at finding one day that
Johannes Biclarensis	PERSON	was missing from her stock , and her prompt surmise that some German had done it , working in the same field and about to anticipate her .

		No , it was the Regius Professor ,
Bishop Stubbs	PERSON	, the greatest his - torian in
England	LOCATION	, who was checking up on her .

		He approved , and so did young Mr.
Creighton	PERSON	. ''

		Tell Mary to go on .

		There is nobody but
Stubbs	PERSON	- doing such work in
Oxford	LOCATION	now , '' he said .

		But
Mary	PERSON	had more ambitious plans and a larger game in mind .

		With her departure from
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	for
London	LOCATION	this was inevitable .

		The West-Gothic kings were well enough so long as one was playing at the feet of
Mark Pattison	PERSON	and Bishop
Stubbs	PERSON	, but most people would n't care much for them .

		Fic - tion was the king sport of the century , and already Mary had seen how one great woman played it .

		Her first novel ,
Miss Bretherton	PERSON	, was a study based on the spectacular success of
Mary Anderson	PERSON	in the early eighties , and it brought her much encourage - ment . ''


Henry James	PERSON	,
Walter Pater	PERSON	,
John Morley	PERSON	, Mr.
Creighton	PERSON	,
Cotter Morrison	PERSON	, Sir
Henry Tay	PERSON	- lor they are all there . ''

		Whatever game Mary wanted to play she found plenty of grown-ups ready to make-believe with her .

		Henry
James	PERSON	indeed went down on his hands and knees and played the critic Beast to her Beauty for the rest of his life .

		Looking back she feels a certain surprise at so much complacency , and a certain remorse at having taken such advantage of it . ''

		Are there similar friends nowadays to help the first steps of a writer ?

		Or i there no leisure left in this crowded life of ours ? ''

		Miss
Bretherton	PERSON	was a trial trip , short and prom - ising .

		One can imagine the delighted excitement in the family when it was whispered about that
Mary	PERSON	was doing another novel a real affair of large canvas and long breath , to set before the world the reconciliation of Christianity with science that Uncle
Matt	PERSON	had proposed in Literature and Dogma and God and the
Bible	LOCATION	, the new faith that all liberal Oxford believed .

		This was
Robert Elsmere	PERSON	.

		Into it she put the best material she would ever have the background , characters , and thought of the Ox - ford w r hich she knew .

		She toiled nobly to be worthy of it , and she achieved much .

		Like
George Eliot	PERSON	she found her great problem to incarnate in flesh and blood and in action the themes that her mind provided , but with the help of portraiture and first hand experience she for once solved it .

		But the glory of >
Robert Elsmere	LOCATION	in its author 's recollection of it is its stupefying popular success the enormous sales in
England	LOCATION	, the runs on the circulating libraries , the personal encounters between rivals for copies , the stupendous piracy in
America	LOCATION	, the review by Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	, the applause of Uncle
Matt	PERSON	he read only the first volume before he died , being , one fancies , a slow reader of fiction all this is like an

Alice	ORGANIZATION	's wonderful growth after eating her cake .

		This story of success was repeated with
David Grieve	PERSON	,
Marcella	PERSON	, Sir
George Tressady	PERSON	,
Helbeck of Bannisdale	ORGANIZATION	, and
Eleanor	PERSON	, and here the Recollections end .

		Of Lady Rose 's Daughter ,
Fenwick	PERSON	's Career and The Marriage of
William Ashe	PERSON	one suspects that
Mary	PERSON	knows that the toys are somewhat worn and battered , and certainly the bright red paint of popular triumph has been licked off .

		The Recollec - tions close with a rather wistful chapter about other writers ,
Meredith	PERSON	,
Hardy	LOCATION	,
Bennett	PERSON	,
Wells	LOCATION	, Gals - worthy , boys who , except
Henry James	PERSON	, apparently would not play with girls .

		None the less Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	records her opinion of them cheerfully and without prejudice except a little for Wells , who is a journalist -LRB- clearly Mary is thinking of a news - boy -RRB- and
Lytton Strachey	LOCATION	, who stuck out his tongue at her grandfather 's portrait .

		Writing and society were the two ^ games Mary enjoyed .

		Politics she would have liked to try the old-fashioned , dignified game that
Palmerstone	PERSON	and Disraeli played in her youth when ladies in famous country houses or in
Mayfair	LOCATION	held the threads of Parliamentary intrigue adroitly wound on their elegant fingers .

		But in later days the politics of suffrage and labor were too rough , and sex had become too horrid .

		Then came the war , and we suspect that Mary played that badly .

		We are thankful that she closes her Recol - lections twenty years ago when the charm was still strong of that incomparable play world which was opened to her so freely and in which she stayed so pleasantly and so long .

London	LOCATION	,
April 10	DATE	J-JVERYBODY THAT RETURNS from
France	LOCATION	takes a grave view of the situation there in every respect .

		The financial problem seems almost insoluble , and
M. Klotz	PERSON	's lamentable exhibition at the
Chamber of Deputies	ORGANIZATION	on
March 13	DATE	showed that he , at any rate , has no solution .

		He could only say that the ques - tion must be postponed until it was known what could be obtained from
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Yet no sane person supposes that any indemnity can be obtained from
Germany	LOCATION	which will enable the financial bur - dens of
France	LOCATION	to be alleviated to any appreciable xtent .

		Justice demands that
Belgium	LOCATION	and
Serbia	LOCATION	should have the first claim , and if
Germany	LOCATION	can be made to compensate them the Allies may think them - selves fortunate .

		As things are it seems quite possi - ble that befare very long
Germany	LOCATION	will no more be in a position to pay an indemnity than
Russia	LOCATION	is .

		Perhaps it would have been wiser not to push matters to extremes .

		As Lord
Beauchamp	PERSON	said re - cently ,
Lord Lansdowne	LOCATION	's initiative in favor of peace is now approved by many more people than at the time when it was taken , and will probably have still more regretful admirers in the near future .

		People who only six months ago were for victory at any cost are now beginning to think that the cost is perhaps greater than the victory is worth .

		And
M. Clemenceau	PERSON	has declared that the victory is a Pyrrhic one so far as
France	LOCATION	is concerned .

		One might reply : '' Tu 1 ` as voulu ,
Georges Dandin	PERSON	. ''

		For my part , I might derive some personal satis - faction from the fact that I have been denounced for the
last three years	DATE	as a '' defeatist , '' and was finally expelled from
France	LOCATION	simply for having fore - told what is now in fact happening .

		It seemed to ane evident that , whatever the military result of the war might be , its prolongation could only be ruinous to
France	LOCATION	.


M. Clemenceau	PERSON	now says in effect that I was right .

		But I can derive no satisfaction from this confirmation of my forebodings .

		I wish that I had proved to be wrong .

		Can anybody now doubt that the rejection of the Austrian peace proposals made in
March 1917	DATE	and of the German peace pro- posals made in
August	DATE	of the same year was a crime against
France	LOCATION	and against
Europe	LOCATION	?

		I am glad to know that the English Government was not chiefly responsible for it .

		That responsibility rests on
M. Alexandre Ribot	PERSON	and
Baron Sonnino	PERSON	.

		The lesson has not yet been learned , as the pro- ceedings at the
Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	show .

		Here dis - gust and disappointment are giving place to indif - ference in that regard .

		People are beginning to recognize that it will soon not matter much what the
Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	decides , for things will have gone too far for its decisions to have any impor - tance .

		We see with amazement our representatives discussing such mattefs as the annexation to
France	LOCATION	of the
Saar Valley	ORGANIZATION	or the acquisition of Dalmatian ports by
Italy	LOCATION	with more than half
Europe	LOCATION	already in revolution and the rest on the verge of it .

		M.
Auguste Gauvain	PERSON	's severe criticism of the Confer - ence in the Journal des Debats of
March 17	DATE	was not more severe than the
Conference	ORGANIZATION	deserves .

		As he said , while .

		the Peace delegates are disputing strips of territory , '' general disorganization is in - creasing in the world with a rapidity which only the blind fail to see . '' ''

		When , '' added
M. Gau	PERSON	- vain , '' agreement has at last been reached as to the division of the spoils k will be too late to profit by them : the tertius gaudens , that is to say , the anar - chist , will have laid hands on everything . ''

		And 466 THE DIAL May 3
M. Gauvain	PERSON	warned the delegates that the peoples are indifferent to territorial acquisitions and are thinking only of the restoration of normal life in peace . ''

		The peoples , '' said
M. Gauvain	PERSON	in con - clusion , '' for whom the men of the chancelleries and the amateur diplomatists speak with superb disdain , will in the end be the masters in spite of all the clauses inscribed in the treaties .

		If those clauses violate evident rights , all the piles of proto - cols heaped on the European cauldron will not pre - vent the lid from being blown off . ''

		Such an article as this in a paper that represents intellectual conservative opinion in
France	LOCATION	is indeed significant .


M. Gauvain	PERSON	's view of the Peace Con - ference is that very generally taken in
England	LOCATION	.

		Only today I was talking about the matter to the manager of a great
London	LOCATION	bank .

		He was protest - ing against the proposal to hold a week 's peace celebration in the
summer	DATE	.

		Most people , he said , saw no sign that there would be much cause for rejoicing .

		The Peace Conference was discredited and there was little or no public interest in its pro- ceedings .

		What people wanted was to get back to work and normal life he used almost exactly the arne words as
M. Gauvain	PERSON	, of whose article he i , ot heard and they would be glad enough if , by
summer	DATE	, a revolution had been averted .

		This is certainly a representative opinion .

		The scheme for a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	produced by the
Paris	LOCATION	Conference is generally regarded as a fiasco . ''

		The Clique of Nations '' is the name that has been given to it by the Labor paper , the
Herald	ORGANIZATION	, which is now a daily .

		The general view in the Labor party is that it is worse than nothing for , instead of being a genuine international organization , it is more like a modern version of the Holy Alliance a hegemony of the five great Allied powers .

		No section of opinion shows any enthusiasm for it .

		Some people in
America	LOCATION	seem to think that the League is a British device for controlling the world .

		They are much mistaken .

		President
Wilson	PERSON	's pro- posal for a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	was enthusiastically received here because it was believed that it would be a genuine international organization limiting the power of the stronger nations and strengthening the weaker .

		It was hoped that it would lead to general disarmament , without which it is impossible to pre - vent wars .

		Public opinion , which had formed such high hopes , is proportionately disappointed at the miserable substitute offered to it .

		And I am bound to say that it is also profoundly disappointed that President
Wilson	PERSON	has not been able to achieve more .

		It is to be feared that he came to
Europe	LOCATION	without any definite scheme of his own .

		In any case he seems to have yielded to pressure not only in regard to the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	, but also on other points .

		For , if report be true , some of the peace conditions contemplated by the Conference are in flagrant con - tradiction with the
Fourteen Points	ORGANIZATION	.

		The pressure has not come from the British Gov - ernment .

		Mr.
Lloyd George	PERSON	is far too acute a judge of public opinion here not to desire a really democratic peace .

		He knows that discontent with the
Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	is one of the causes of the industrial unrest .

		Indeed , if a general strike on economic grounds is averted it is quite possible that there will be one as a protest against the peace con - ditions , if they are what they are expected to be .

		The reactionary influences at the
Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	are , I am sorry to say , the French and Italian dele - gates .

		It is they who are aimed at in
M. Gauvain	LOCATION	's article that I have just quoted , for it is they who have wasted the time of the Conference in disputes about strips of territory , and who are opposed to disarmament and a genuine international organiza - tion .

		They are still at the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of
Vienna	LOCATION	.

		I should be sorry to think that they really represent the French and Italian peoples , but there can be no doubt about their attitude .

		It is the French Gov - ernment too that has prevented any sane policy or indeed any policy at all in regard to
Russia	LOCATION	.

		The most violent and uncompromising opposition to the Russian Revolution comes from the official represen - tatives of the country of the Revolution .

		Unless the
Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	mends its ways the outlook in
Europe	LOCATION	is a da * rk one .

		I am sure that
M. Gauvain	PERSON	is right in saying that the people care nothing about territorial acquisitions and strategi - cal frontiers .

		They want peace and a new start .

		At any rat that is the feeling here .

		Nobody cares any more about the German colonies , or about pun - ishing the
Kaiser	PERSON	, or about making
Germany	LOCATION	pay .

		The English people demand peace conditions which will make an army of occupation unnecessary , and if it does not get them there will be trouble .

		Meanwhile the makeshift
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	has been unfavorably received by the small Allied powers and the neutral countries .

		In
Belgium	LOCATION	in particular its constitution is deeply resented .

		Bel - gium is economically and commercially a more im - portant country than
Italy	LOCATION	, and it feels that it has been scurvily treated after the terrible sacrifices that it has made .

		Those sacrifices were made in the cause of liberty and democracy , not to secure the domination of the world by a clique of five powers .

		The whole question must be reconsidered and it may be better , after all , if the present scheme for a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	is not incorporated in the pre - liminary treaty of peace .

		For it can not be final and it has not the support of the peoples of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		ROBERT
DELL	ORGANIZATION	.

		THE DIAL
GEORGE DONLIN JOHN DEWEY ROBERT MORSS LOVETT	PERSON	, Editor In Charge of the Reconstruction Program
THORSTEIN VEBLEN CLARENCE BRITTEN HELEN MAROT	PERSON	IHE MEMORANDUM OF THE ALLIED GOVERN - ments transmitted to the German Government No - vember 5 ,
1918	DATE	, by President
Wilson	PERSON	, which formed the basis of the
Armistice	ORGANIZATION	, affirmed the willingness of the Allies and the
United States	LOCATION	to make peace on the basis of the fourteen points promulgated by the President
January 8	DATE	, * r9i8 , and the principles of set - tlement enunciated in his subsequent addresses .

		It further expressly defined the compensation to be made by
Germany	LOCATION	, and limited the liability to dam - age done to the civilian population of the Allies by the aggression of
Germany	LOCATION	by land , by sea , and from the air .

		Scarcely had the ink of the signatures dried when this provision was cast aside by Mr.
Lloyd George	PERSON	in his election appeal on the basis of making
Germany	LOCATION	pay the entire cost of the war , and on this platform
England	LOCATION	gave him a huge majority in the new Parliament .

		England 's repudiation of this ex - plicit provision of the Armistice gave the cry to
France	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	.

		Jn the months that have fol - lowed , what has transpired of the deliberations of the
Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	has had no reference to the agreement made through President
Wilson	PERSON	: the whole discussion has turned on what
Germany	LOCATION	can pay .

		Now that the sum has been fixed approximate - ly , and it appears that it is far smaller than was im - plied in the promises of the Allied Governments to their people , there is Still no mention of its distribu - tion according to the principle laid down in the Armistice .

		On the contrary , Mr.
Lloyd George	PERSON	has reaffirmed to Parliament his pre-election promises , and the latest forecast of the apportionment gives to
England	LOCATION	a third of what is now everywhere referred to as the German indemnity .

		Whether the amount paid by
Germany	LOCATION	is sufficient or not to cover damage done to the civilian population and their property , the Allies have made a scrap of paper of their en - gagement .

		This is not the most serious infraction of the terms of the Armistice .

		The most immediately im - portant of the fourteen points are those having to do with territorial arrangements , and here again the dis - cussions of the Conference have inevitably led to the belief that the Allies would not be bound by their promises .

		The proposed arrangements in regard to the
Saar Valley	LOCATION	and the left bank of the Rhine are in implicit contravention of the eighth point , as that in regard to
Danzig	PERSON	is of the thirteenth .

		Still fur - ther , the Armistice set definite boundaries to military occupation by the Allied forces .

		The breaking of those boundaries in
Hungary	LOCATION	was the immediate cause of the overthrow of Count
Karolyi	PERSON	's Govern - ment .

		The ninth point states that '' a readjustment of the frontiers of
Italy	LOCATION	should be effected along clearly recognizable lines of nationality . ''

		The Armistice allowed the temporary occupation of Ger - man territory by Italian forces , with the result de - scribed by the Neue Zuricher Zeitung ,
February 28 , 1919	DATE	, as follows : The Italians are continuing their policy of forcibly annexing German
South Tyrol	LOCATION	and thus confronting the
Paris Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	with a fait accompli .

		In con - trast to the army of occupation in
Germany	LOCATION	, which did not prevent the population -LSB- with the exception of
Alsace	LOCATION	-
Lorraine	PERSON	-RSB- from voting for the German National As - sembly , the Italians prohibited the inhabitants of
German South Tyrol	ORGANIZATION	from taking part in the national Austrian elections .

		Recently the Gernyan communes were visited by commissions of Italian officers who induced people who do not understand a word of Italian to sign state - ments expressing satisfaction with the Italian occupation .

		As the inhabitants do not know what they are signing , they are told that the statements submitted to them are receipts for food about to be distributed .

		Anyone of the native officials who refuses to sign is denounced to his community as opposing the distribution of food supplies .

		In Meran the teaching of Italian in the schools has al - ready been made obligatory .

		History is now being taught according to Italian books .

		It is also significant that
General Amante	ORGANIZATION	has given orders to Italianize the names of all railway stations in the German section of
South Tyrol	LOCATION	.

		It is superfluous to point out that a League of Na - tions which should set out by guaranteeing political arrangements brought about by such methods would be merely a form of capitalizing dishonor and vali - dating a lie .

		rLL THAT HAS TRANSPIRED OF THE PROCEEDINGS of the
Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	since the Covenant of the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	was presented to the world on
February 1 4	DATE	tends to weaken confidence in the -LRB- good faith of the parties thereto .

		On the one hand the
United States	LOCATION	has insisted on the addition of a clause making exclusive reservation in regard to that hoary fetish , the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	, a reservation conducing only to selfish interest and vulgar prestige .

		On the other , the claim of
Japan	LOCATION	for the recognition of equality of her citizenship with that of other nations has been summarily rejected .

		Both the freedom of the
Western Hemisphere	ORGANIZATION	from European aggression 468 THE DIAL
May 3	DATE	and the adjustment of immigration according to mutual interest are matters which should be left to the operation of the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	if any con - fidence whatever is to be placed in that organization .

		Faith and good will are the basis of such an organi - zation .

		Where are they ?

		But the most serious lack of faith in the .

		League on the part of its proponents is shown in their failure to make use of it as a means toward peace and reconciliation .

		The exclusion of
Germany	LOCATION	, or her admission by an extorted accept - ance of the principles of the Covenant , is fatal alike to the conception of the League as proposed and fought for , and to its working under the present forces in control .

		Still the question insistently de - mands answer : Can those forces make peace for the world ?

		That the treaty may be signed , the Cove - nant adopted , and the machinery of the League set up constitute no answer to that question .

		These things may prove only more clearly the impotence of existing governments to give an affirmative an - swer .

		More and more clearly it appears that a con - dition precedent to a true peace is a change in those governments themselves .

		As the Russian Revolu - tion , by eliminating one set of nationalistic interests , made the first simplification in the problem , so now it appears that the next steps are revolution in
Italy	LOCATION	, in
Frande	LOCATION	, in
England	LOCATION	wherever selfish imperial - ism blocks the path of progress toward world peace .

		To quote Mr.
J. A. Hobson	PERSON	: `` If the workers within each nation can not capture their state and through their state the new international arrange - ment ,
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	or whatever it may be called , they will be helpless in the hands of their rulers and their capitalists . ''

		Even so the
League	ORGANIZATION	has its temporary function and value .

		The fact that it is not a peoples ' league , merely an arrangement whereby governments are impeded in making war , is a cynical recognition of the fact that it is not the people who need such restraint , for it is not they who make war .

		But if
the League	ORGANIZATION	is to be the con - structive instrument of righting the monstrous wrongs of the world , if it is to be the beginning of a genuine society of nations , it must be under the con - trol of men who possess a common ground of under - standing other than participation in loot , a basis of mutual trust other than the honor among thieves .

		.

		/ \ .

		N INSTANCE OF THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF NATIONAL repentance is the attitude of the American people toward the lynching of Negroes .

		That the country feels a certain shame is clear .

		The news of such out - rages is now largely suppressed .

		Even the press forgoes the profit of playing upon its readers ' appe - tite for atrocities , and when the Liberator published the accounts of certain peculiarly hideous mob crimes it was roundly denounced for lack of patriot - ism .

		In the case of the massacre of
East Saint Louis	LOCATION	, after a brief spasm of horror the country averted its face .

		The trials were perfunctory .

		The responsibility of the executive of the state , and of the military authorities under whose very eyes mur - der with fiendish tortures took place , was not pressed .

		When the report of the
Congressional	ORGANIZATION	committee of investigation was received a motion was made that it be not printed , on the ground of its lack of importance , and though this motion failed to pass the report was virtually suppressed .

		The public printer replies to inquiries that he has no copies for distribution .

		This impulse toward con - cealment shows that we are as a nation under con - viction of sin , but there are few signs of remorse .

		An effort to arouse the public conscience on this matter and to initiate works meet for repentance will be made by a
National Conference	ORGANIZATION	on
Lynch	PERSON	- ing to be held in
New York City	LOCATION
May 5	DATE	and 6 , '' to take concerted action against lynching and lawlessness wherever found , and to consider what measures should be adopted to abate them . ''

		IHE WORDS OF THE CALL ABOVE QUOTED CONTAIN an oblique reference to the fact that lynching is no longer a purely race problem nor is it always a matter of reprobation and shame .

		On the contrary , as an expression of patriotic sentiment it has been recognized as part of our moral life , and associated with our best efforts toward the progress of the world .

		It is invoked under the sanction of patriotic societies , military authorities , and sponsors for the Victory Loan .

		The chief propagandist for the
Security League	ORGANIZATION	still boasts of his attempt as agent provocateur before an audience in a Western uni - versity .

		The press has repeatedly borne witness to the crimes of violence committed by men in uniform against persons exercising the right of lawful as - sembly , but whereas our courts martial have been active in grinding out sentences to death and life imprisonment against men who have failed in some minor observance of military law , we have yet to hear of a case where a soldier has been punished for attacking the institutions of democracy which he was drafted to defend except the men who rioted at
Houston	LOCATION	, who were black , and who were hanged .

		An instance of the attitude of the army toward mob law is shown by the petition of soldiers of the 27th division to General
O'Ryan	PERSON	threatening violence unless the entirely lawful performance of opera in German were prevented by '' organized action . ''

		Apparently the threat was regarded as so natural as to attract no comment or rebuke .

		An organ which claims to represent the returned sol - diers is
Arthur Guy Empey	PERSON	's Treat 'Em Rough , whose eminent services are enlisted in behalf of the Victory Loan .

		In the
March	DATE	issue Mr.
Empey	PERSON	ad - vises the men who were in the trenches when he was on the lecture platform as follows : The Fifth Liberty Loan , drive will soon be here .

		Make a Bolshevist or an ''
I. W. W.	PERSON	'' buy one of those bonds , and believe me , from that time on that fellow is going to
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 469 support Uncle
Sara	PERSON	, and , if necessary , fight for him .

		If you can not , after very patient endeavor , sell him , then show him what it means to get a good Yankee wallop in the nose .

		And again in
April	DATE	, referring to Socialists : This speaker , instead of being arrested and given a chance to gain his freedom by putting up as bail a few paltry dollars , thus being enabled to further spread his treason , should be executed by a firing squad composed of men in uniform .

		The staff of this magazine and some of us are pretty good shots would be only too willing to volunteer for such a firing squad , and I know that every true-thinking soldier , sailor , or marine would do the same .

		The national and local authorities which are inter - ested in preventing the spread of Bolshevism might consider whether the restraint of those patriots who invoke mob violence to suppress free speech and opinion might conduce to this end .

		JLHE UTTERANCES OF MEN LIKE THE REVEREND
Charles A. Eaton	PERSON	,
McNutt McElroy	PERSON	, and
Arthur Guy Empey	PERSON	may be discounted as part of the ritual of violence which their professional employments make necessary .

		In the same way the utterances on which the I. W. W. leaders were convicted in Chi - cago and elsewhere are part of a ritual of sabotage , which had no more reference to the question of the country at war than the ritual language of Christians with their Golden Rule and Sermon on the Mount had to the same situation .

		Far more serious is the resort of the local authorities , whose professional function is to keep the peace , to open provocation and violence .

		The facts of the behavior > f the police at Lawrence are suppressed in the news columns of the press , but have been made known by communications from Mrs.
Glendower Evans	PERSON	and others who were eyewitnesses of brutal assaults made by the protectors of society against strikers who were striving to preserve a peaceful attitude .

		Of these assaults , both on the public street and be - hind prison walls , there is no shadow of doubt , pet no official cognizance is taken , no charge is arought , and the reign of law continues .

		The Gov - ernor of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	looks on Lawrence as the Grovernor of
Illinois	LOCATION	on
East Saint Louis	LOCATION	, and , like Gallio , they care for none of these things .

		A HE CULTURE OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY , vas largely historical .

		Its authors of epic scope were listorians
Carlyle	LOCATION	,
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	,
Grote	PERSON	,
Napier	PERSON	,
Kinglake	PERSON	, to mention no others .

		Drama , fiction , 3oetry , when devoted to high and serious ends , took : heir material from history .

		The trust in history as i guide to life was reiterated in definitions : '' His - : ory is philosophy teaching by experience , '' and the .

		ike .

		With the publication of
Darwin	PERSON	's Origin of species , the intellectual life took a new turn .

		The scientific replaced the historical method even his - tory itself became a matter of evaluating human testimony .

		The geological record reduced the period of history to a brief moment in the life of man .

		Biology became the background of human thought drama , fiction , poetry in serious moods reflected it .

		Modern psychology and sociology were born .

		Only in politics has the historical background and method persisted with undiminished authority .

		Only there has the obsession lingered that historical study and precedent will serve as infallible guides .

		But the events of the last years have given a rude shock to the belief that men and nations learn anything from recorded experience .

		The record itself , when sub - ject to political use , becomes distorted beyond the semblance of truth .

		If there is one lesson that stands out today it is the failure of history to teach , or men 's perverse incapacity to profit by its teaching .

		The failure of empires of the past had no message for modern imperialists ; the economic teachings of war had none for modern capitalists ; the disillusion - ments of peace congresses have none for modern diplomats .

		Apparently in national and international organization nations are thrown back on the trial and error method .

		They are becoming laboratories in which nature must be read in the language of - experiment mortars in which human material is brayed and broken , to be purified in the process of disintegration , and the residue fused and welded to new forms and uses by fervent heat .

		Of the na - tions which submit themselves boldly to experiment
Russia	LOCATION	is the type ; of those that trust to the biased textbooks of their past the
United States	LOCATION	is the chief .

		No country , unless it is
China	LOCATION	, is so proud of its past , so confident in the wisdom of the fathers , so unconscious of the vital phenomena of the modern world .

		The contrast is reflected in the masterpieces of
Lenin	ORGANIZATION	and

		1 MMANUEL KANT ONCE WROTE A SKETCH , A century and a quarter ago , on Perpetual Peace .

		He prefaced it with a jest , as tasteless as it was clumsy , to say that the running title under which he wrote Zum ewigen
Frieden	PERSON	, that is to say ,
The House of Peace Everlasting	ORGANIZATION	was borrowed from the sign - board of a certain roadside tavern adjoining a cer - tain ancient churchyard .

		Compounded of bar-room and graveyard , this wise man 's jest will to many readers doubtless have seemed as pointless as it is tasteless .

		But that will be true only of those readers of Kant who have not had the inestimable fortune to live through these days of returning peace and to witness the maudlin deliberations of that con - clave of elder statesmen who are now arranging to make the world safe for the vested rights of inter - national dissension .

		The point of
Kant	PERSON	's jest is plain now .

		Today his readers are in a position to marvel that even that wise old man should have been so wise as all that .

		It is quite uncanny .

		47 THE DIAL
May 3	DATE	Communications SIR : It seems to me that no day should pass without dignified but persistent agitation of the fol - lowing points : Why are we fighting the political majority of the Russian people ?

		Have not wives , mothers , and fathers , as well as the soldiers themselves , a right to know for what reason American boys are giving their lives or being wounded in a foreign country ?

		Is it right or just for men to be conscripted to kill people with whom they are not at war ?

		Why was there no answer to the note from the Russian Soviet Government to President
Wilson	PERSON	asking for an ex - planation of our conduct and a statement of what amounts to our `` war aims '' ?

		Should not sol - diers wounded now in
Russia	LOCATION	be able to claim dam - ages for being forced to fight against a people with whom we are not at war ?

		Has there not been enough agony and bloodshed in a just cause against Prussianism and militarism , without agony and bloodshed in an unjust cause ?

		Or have we been contaminated into taking up Hohenzollern methods against the Russians ?

		We are told in recent reports from
Paris	LOCATION	that we are to keep troops in
Russia	LOCATION	to give '' moral sup - port '' to certain approved but fluctuating govern - ments against the immoralities and illegalities of the
Bolsheviki	LOCATION	.

		But let us look to our own morals , our own doings , our own laws in
America	LOCATION	, before , we undertake by force to improve another people .

		We are persecuting political offenders in a way to recall darkest Czarism .

		Our state prisons are abominations , medieval in their tortures .

		Unless we quickly relieve and remedy these and other evils , we must expect among our own people revolt and even Bolshevism .

		The greater the tyranny the more ex - treme the revolt .


Russia	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	are a lesson to the whole world .

		Kerensky 's moderation was not supported by the Allies .

		Bolshevism fol - lowed .

		Czaristic
Russia	LOCATION	and tyrannical , imperial - istic
Germany	LOCATION	forced the people to revolt .

		Two years .

		ago could you have persuaded anyone that re - volt of the people of these imperialistic countries would have been so sudden and complete and suc - cessful ?

		Let imperialistic conservatives of Eng - land bear in mind their decisions at the Peace Con - ference .

		The
British Labor Party	ORGANIZATION	was seemingly defeated at the polls but is strong and on the alert .

		Let imperialistic conservatives in
America	LOCATION	as well take heed , because the more oppressive and tyran - nical they become , as in the
Mooney	PERSON	case , the more sudden and violent the deluge .

		I am proud to be an American these days , proud that we are represented by the only man who is speaking clearly in the cause of democracy at the
Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	, demanding honest treatment for all people as well as for the people he represents .

		President
Wilson	PERSON	originally raised a voice against the Russian invasion .

		But his own party , as well as the Republicans and Allies , silenced that voice .

		His vision of what would happen has come true , and time has divulged the contradictory un justness of our invasion .

		Our way of conferring '' self-deter - mination `` is to kill .

		I appeal to you who have stood out against the invasion of
Russia	LOCATION	, and urge you to even greater effort .

		And I appeal to all liberals to make themselves heard at this crucial time .


JULIA ELLSWORTH FORD	PERSON	.


New York City	LOCATION	.

		MILITARY TRAINING AS EDUCATION SIR : In your issue of
January 25	DATE	appears a very interesting contribution by
George Soule	PERSON	on the educational value of military training .

		His argu - ment is interesting and instructive , and doubtless many thousands of serious men have felt the same things in the
last two years	DATE	, but few could express these ideas so definitely and in so few words .

		My aim in writing is to present the other side of the question in part , and to explain some features of military training that have educational value .

		Mr.
Soule	PERSON	has chosen the weak points , and I say can - didly I am sure the points he makes must be reck - oned with .

		It is a problem to be worked out by pedagogical experts .

		It has often appeared to the writer , a mere civilian in uniform , that military methods are too conservative , and the chiefs , those in high command , are rather '' inhospitable to new ideas . ''

		The American public , the American Con - gress , those in high military command , and the horde of under-chiefs should candidly admit that the machine and the methods are not perfect , and set about to take counsel to improve them .

		Army officials must take the thinking public into their confidence .

		The question of military training is fundamen - tally a question of education .

		Since the problem of universal military training is imminent , the most imminent question for citizens , fathers , and mothers is what ideals , what methods shall control the training .

		No counsel or advice or suggestion from any source should be refused or ignored by law - makers and military leaders to insure not only ef - fective military training , but valuable habits and useful information available in civil pursuits .

		To achieve this end , it occurs to me that
Congress	ORGANIZATION	or the War Department should raise a commission , composed of one military official , one university man , one high school teacher or superintendent , one business man , and one professional man , to call for suggestions from officers and enlisted men demobil - ized from service to study the whole question of training and discipline in the army from a patriotic and pedagogical viewpoint ; and to report conclusions and recommendations .

		to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and the
War Department	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is no mystery or esoteric force
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 47 1 enshrouding and obscuring military questions .

		Methods and ideals that succeed in efficient indus - tries may be applied advantageously to army train - ing and discipline .

		Since universal training takes the entire citizenry into direct contact with the army , military leaders must consent to take counsel ` of and with civilians .

		Since the military establish - ment is to be broadened numerically and financially , its high command must admit the possibility of im - provement by adopting suggestions from '' partially initiated civilians . ''

		There is a reason for the archaic , non-progressive methods of which Mr.
Soule	PERSON	complains .

		The American public has never taken any interest in the army except in time of war , and then there was no time to consider and devise improvements .

		In peace times the army has been considered and treated as a thing apart from our chief national interests .

		Before our entry into the world war , millions of Americans never saw a soldier .

		Further , military leaders were not edu - cators .

		Officers came from the ranks or from West Point , but in both cases the previous training was solely to make soldiers .

		Years of military discip - line do not encourage originality or develop the habit of mind of seeking out improvements , but instill a disposition to accept existing conditions and to acquiesce in prevailing ideas , ideals , and methods .

		Furthermore , military power is one-man power .

		The commander neither asks nor accepts suggestions from inferiors .

		As it is impossible for one man to know all things , the chief who does not take counsel of others is shut off from the greatest source of information and enlightenment .

		Hence the ne - qessity of some such commission as suggested .


JOHN J. McSwAiN	PERSON	, Captain , Infantry .

Morrison	PERSON	,
Va.	LOCATION	.

		THE GERMAN INDEMNITY SIR : In regard to Mr.
Codman	PERSON	's artfcle How to Secure the German Indemnity , it is inconceivable after taking all facts into consideration just how this indemnity can ever be paid .

		From a stand - point of state socialism Mr.
Codman	PERSON	's plan appears sound , sane , and practical ; but conditions have so changed as to make this extremely doubtful if not altogether unthinkable .

		The law of economic de - terminism is entirely ignored , also human nature .

		When a y man lies awake nights thinking and schem - ing , and chases dollars all day to amass a fortune , he is not going to give it up without a fight .

		On the other hand if the people were given their economic freedom , as a man might have a fortune dropped into his lap , would they appreciate its value , and would they hold it ?

		There is an old saying that anything that comes easy goes easy .

		That is true to human nature .

		Even if Mr.
Codman	PERSON	's plan were feasible and put into practice , there would be an unceasing opposition , and it would not be long before those who so desired would have no fear or hesitancy of inaugurating a scheme to exact tribute from others .

		Mr.
Codman	PERSON	is apparently not informed as to
Germany	LOCATION	's present financial condition .

		Dr.
Rudolf	PERSON	, one of the editors of Freiheit , the organ of the In - dependent Socialists of
Germany	LOCATION	states that :
Today Germany	LOCATION	is hopelessly bankrupt ... Ger - many 's national total debt is 170,000,000,000 marks .

		Add to this total , debts of the states , cities , and communi - ties 50,000,000,000 marks ; and add further 20,000,000,000 for the uncovered paper money in circulation .

		Besides ,
Germany	LOCATION	's running expenses today are
4,000,000,000 marks	MONEY	a month , say another 50,000,000,000 a year , making a grand total of obligations of nearly
300,000,000,000 marks	MONEY	-LRB- approximately
$ 75,000,000,000	MONEY	under the normal rate of exchange -RRB- .

		Thjs is more than the national wealth today , and this without paying a penny of indemnity or including present necessary payments for food and raw materials .

		In the face of this could the German people be expected to pay an indemnity and at the same time pay off their own national debt , as well as the neces - sary payments for food and raw materials in a '' re - markably short time , '' even though the wealth-own - ing classes were deprived of everything except title to their holdings , by being forced to pay over the full rental value for the right of ownership which the Allies would have to exact through force ?

		Will the German working classes voluntarily place them - selves in virtual bondage for generations to come to pay off the moral debts of the Junkers ?

		Mr.
Cod	PERSON	- man apparently takes this for granted in saying that '' sentimentally , it would make little difference to the factory hands , the peasants , to the tenant farm - ers , '' to whom they paid their tribute .

		-LRB- The own - ers of capital and employers Clever have and never will pay any tribute . -RRB-

		Another misjudgment of human nature .

		He forgets that the working classes are fast becoming class conscious , which means that they are finding out that the interests of any person , organization , or institution that exploits them are diametrically opposed to their own .

		Assuming that the Germans could pay the in - demnity under Mr.
Codman	PERSON	's plan , would the prop - ertied classes give up private ownership of the nat - ural resources when technically they would not be required to do so ?

		If
Germany	LOCATION	must have foreign markets to dis - pose of her surplus production , the Allied nations must also have them to dispose of their surplus pro- duction , more especially so if the Allies were pro- ducing as abundantly as the Germans would be .

		These markets are now and always have been the competitive markets of the world , and with nations competing for them , there is bound to be a War at some time or other .

		Mr.
Codman	PERSON	also proposes that the Allied gov - ernments practice the same methods at home as he thinks they should practice on the Germans .

		Would any of the Allied governments do this ?

		No .

		Where did he get such a funny idea ?

		472 THE DIAL
May 3	DATE	Notes on New Books CIVILIZATION .

		By
Georges Duhamel	PERSON	.

		Century .

		Certain modern painters have tried to suggest the power and influence of machines on our present - day life : it is '' those machines of yours that used to amuse me once , when I knew nothing , but that now fill me with horror , because they are the very soul of this war , the principle and reason of this war ! ''

		that cause
Georges Duhamel	PERSON	to write with fury little stories of his experiences as a surgeon with the French army .

		He sees the battlefield as a vast '' brazier , '' the front line as a '' workshop of tritura - tion and destruction , '' the automobile ambulance as the first '' repair shop , '' in which '' skilful work - men '' hurriedly patch human bits of the military machine .

		Field hospitals are '' flesh-factories , '' whose wheels revolve on themselves when there is insufficient material to gorge them .

		The heart of the hospital is the monstrous sterilizing autoclave , '' raised up like a monarch on a sort of throne . ''

		The worst of it is that '' civilization 's reply to itself , the correction it was giving to its own destructive eruptions , all this complexity to efface a little of the harm engendered by the age of machines , '' seems to be simply the pincers , the delicate knives , the microscopes , and the autoclaves of the hospital .

		No wonder
Duhamel	PERSON	cries out : '' I hate the twentieth century as I hate rotten
Europe	LOCATION	and the whole world on which this wretched
Europe	LOCATION	is spread out like a great spot of axle grease . ''

		And yet : '' Civilization !

		the true Civilization I often think of it .

		It is like a choir of harmonious voices chanting a hymn in my heart , it is a marble statue on a barren hill , it is a man saying , ' Love one another ! '

		and ' Return good for evil ! ' ''

		And if civilization '' is not in the heart of man , well , it 's nowhere . ''

		And it is the heart of man suffering from terrible wounds , or oppressed by living with corpses , which he shows us in these sickening side-wing sketches of war .

		They are good little stories , not always so well written as one would expect -LRB- is that the translator 's fault ? -RRB-

		but illumined by an irony , a weary humor , and a disillusioned martyr-spirit characteristic of the French litterateurs of
Duhamel	ORGANIZATION	's generation .

		One is tempted to say that
Duhamel	PERSON	in this book is the
Oliver Jeannin	PERSON	of Jean-Christophe gone to war .

		THE POWER OF
DANTE	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Charles Hall Grandgent	PERSON	.

		Marshall Jones ;
Boston	LOCATION	.

		As someone has said , '' there are books and books , '' and of these the
Divina Commedia	ORGANIZATION	is the second that is always able to give sustenance of some sort to every type of mind .

		Dante speaks with a certainty that catches the sympathetic reader at once and makes him feel that he is on a firm ground of belief .

		The reasons for this power that
Dante	ORGANIZATION	has over even the modern efficiency expert who is supposed to be otherwise occupied than with the vaporings of a centuries dead mystic Mr.
Grandgent	PERSON	has well set forth in these
Lowell Lectures	ORGANIZATION	.

		He shows us the poet 's faith , its reality and working force ; his morality , stern in its logic but lightened with pity for the frailties of the flesh ; his uncompromising , honest , scholarly , and courteous temperament ; the varied course of his life and the wanton injustice done him by his beloved
Florence	LOCATION	; his vision of the meaning of life and the allegory of Man , so much truer than the silly symbols of some more recent seers ; his keenness of conception , realistic in its de - tail ; and his workmanship and diction , which , grievous to relate , were the result of a classical ed - ucation .

		These lectures can not be enjoyed to the full without a fairly complete acquaintance with the poem , an acquaintance which possibly a
Lowell Lecturer	ORGANIZATION	alone has a right to expect ; but if they send the reader to attempt the great journey with
Dante	PERSON	as guide they will have added to the sum - total of human joy .

		Among the pleasantest features of the book are the many graceful and scholarly translations by Mr.
Grandgent	PERSON	in
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's own meter .

		It makes one hope that Mr.
Grandgent	PERSON	will some day give us that long-awaited perfect transla - tion of the
Divina Commedia	ORGANIZATION	which will unite ac - curacy and real poetry in the English .

Edward Waldo Emerson	PERSON	, with the help of
Bliss Perry	PERSON	, who wrote nine personal sketches , and of four other contribu - tors , who together wrote five .

		The differences among the contributors are enough to make the sketches vary perceptibly in quality , from Professor

Emerson	PERSON	's au - thoritative pomp .

		The sketches of
Emerson	LOCATION	,

		At first the club was often referred to by outsiders as ''
Agassiz 's Club	ORGANIZATION	. ''


Louis Agassiz	PERSON	, the expansive , cultivated French-Swiss who loved his work in
America	LOCATION	too much to respond to the French Emperor 's offer of a chair in the
Museum of Natural History	ORGANIZATION	at
Paris	LOCATION	, was fortunately one of the ruling spirits .

		He helped to keep the club from being the group of well-behaved literary Brahmins that too many of us are accustomed to regard it .

		At ''
Parker	PERSON	's , '' opposite the
City Hall	LOCATION	, where the statue of
Franklin	PERSON	bade them beware of provincial - ism , these good gentlemen ate from three to nine ; and imbibed -LRB- discreetly -RRB- sherry , sauterne , and claret ; and talked with a degree of wisdom and brilliance since then probably unequaled in the
Western Hemisphere	LOCATION	.

		Every serious student of American life and letters will need to know this book .

		It is printed and bound perfectly .

		Dr.
Emerson	PERSON	's record runs to 1871 :
William Henry Shelton	PERSON	's record of the
Salmagundi Club	ORGANIZATION	begins with its inception in that year and runs to the present .

		The difference between the
Boston	LOCATION	and the
New York	LOCATION	of
1871	DATE	is roughly symbolized by these two famous clubs : the one dominantly literary on a Puritan foundation , the other artistic with the simple ideals of the painter .

		Salmagundi grew out of '' a group of art students who formed a sketch class for mutual improvement , '' and prospered in the same current of progress that is associated with the old
Scribner	ORGANIZATION	's Monthly -LRB- later the Century Mag - azine -RRB- , for which they drew .

		For many years the members gave annual exhibitions of black-and-white drawings ; a large number of these early sketches are admirably reproduced in the present book .

		Not to mention several '' laymen , '' the original members were
F. S. Church	ORGANIZATION	, Will Low ,
Fred Vance	PERSON	, the Harleys ,
W. H. Shelton	PERSON	,
Alfred E. Emslie	PERSON	, and
J. P. Andrews	PERSON	.

		In
1887	DATE	, the last exhibition year , the club gave up its character as a group of sketchers and became frankly social .

		Recognizing the re - stricted interest in a record of this kind , the pub - lishers have printed a limited edition .

		Like the
Saturday Club	ORGANIZATION	, it is an exceptionally beautiful book .

		GOVERNMENT AND THE WAR .

		By
Spenser Wilkinson	PERSON	.

		McBride .

		For those to whom the inevitability of war is a foregone conclusion this volume of essays by the Chichele .

		professor of Military History at Ox - ford will prove very acceptable reading , presenting as it does every essential argument to prove that the development of human societies and the progress of civilization has been attended and even conditioned by warfare .

		According to Professor
Wilkinson	PERSON	, war is an unavoidable Fact of
Government	ORGANIZATION	and the State a view of the '' realists '' in politics from
Machiavelli	ORGANIZATION	to
Bernhardi	LOCATION	.

		A view , one might add , that seems to be falling into considerable disfavor among those classes of the people who hitherto have been expected meekly to bear the brunt of this '' Fact . ''


Spenser Wilkinson	PERSON	, however , is very far from being a mere zealot or enthusiast in the cause of militarism .

		Despite his quarrel with
Norman Angell	PERSON	-LRB- touched on in the essay What is Peace ? -RRB-

		an impartial reader can not but see the force and logic of many of the author 's contentions : the whole trouble is seen to rest in the old-fashioned concep - tion of the State as in some sort an entity , not to be in any way modified or tampered with by those cos - mopolitan and international influences at present operating in the world .

		Thus , the major premise being discredited , or at least very seriously ques - tionable , the whole fabric of Mr.
Wilkinson	PERSON	's mili - taristic politics crumbles .

		The book is of interest as showing how well a certain element of the English public assimilated the ideas of the Prussian philos - ophy they had vowed utterly to destroy .

		THE VALLEY OF VISION .

Henry Van Dyke	PERSON	.

		Scribner .

		THE VALLEY OF VISION .

		By
Sarah Corn	PERSON	- stock .

		Doubleday , Page .

		Despite a common title , a common cost , and a common humanity , there are numerous points of divergence in these two-books ; the coincidence has no literary significance .

		Dr.
Van Dyke	PERSON	has assem - bled a series of sketches and short stories , most of them with the war as background , whereas
Miss Comstock	PERSON	unburdens herself of a novel which ends two years before the war begins .

		A trivial dis - tinction of the literal-minded , no doubt ; but note the closing lines of the novel : It was then the
summer of 1912	DATE	.

		She went on packing .

		She was brisk ... '' I can see , '' she mused , following some dim train of thought , '' how it must be how war must come as a godsend to a man or woman at certain times '' And the old Psychologist smiled less cynically than before upon
Marcia Warren	PERSON	almost kindly , in fact , as if wanting to tell her that
1914	DATE	was but two years away .

		In style to continue the parallel
Miss Comstock	PERSON	is like the gilt on a picture frame , obliterating the wood ; while the effect with Dr.
Van Dyke	PERSON	is more like that of varnish it is smooth , rather glossy , and occasionally brings out the beauty of the grain .

		Doubtless Dr.
Van Dyke	PERSON	reacted deeply and au - thentically to the emotional experiences of war , and without question his vantage post for observation was far superior to that of most of those who have committed their thoughts to books ; yet one turns the excellently printed and faintly amber pages feeling that here are good intentions run into lean literature .

		Either a temperamental inability to let himself go , or perhaps a conscious curbing of the pen , has resulted in a product too correct and too impersonal to kindle the spark of enthusiasm .

		When Dr.
Van Dyke	PERSON	unbends , it is with an audible pro- fessorial creak .

		If he seeks to transcribe the slangy discourse of college men he jumbles the obsolete and

		476 THE DIAL May the current jargon in an orderly fashion which belies the uninitiate .

		When he approaches the white heat of creative writing , he sacrifices its finer fever to avoid its minor flaws .

		It is difficult to be patient with such repeated lapses into schoolmaster con - descension as : '' Well , I must tell you more about that , else you can never feel the meaning of this story ; '' or , `` Is this the end of the story ?

		Who can say ? ''

		There are times when the helping hand is best withheld .

		Miss
Comstock	ORGANIZATION	's claim to
The Valley of Vision	ORGANIZATION	would hardly hold in a court of literary equity .

		Her novel is an interesting sample of manufactured atmosphere , done with a fretwork of
Ellen Key	PERSON	and an embroidered smartness which attains such heights as : '' She read
William James	PERSON
till midnight	TIME	she always spoke of him disrespectfully as her spiritual hot toddy . ''

		Miss
Comstock	PERSON	's story is it - self not unlike spiritual cold slaw .

		DOMUS DOLORIS .

		By
W. Compton Leith	PERSON	.

		Lane .

		If the droning , prose of
Compton Leith	ORGANIZATION	causes the reader to revive the old discussion of style and matter , he will probably head precipitately for the camp of those who maintain that what you say is far more important than the way you say it .

		He will reflect that the more you divorce thought from style the more sensuous the latter becomes , and that the senses sate themselves far sooner than the in - tellect .

		He will remember too that to write prose more than feebly suggestive of Pater necessitates as rich and developed an attitude towards life as the master himself had .

		And always he will note , as he follows the inane meditations of this present-day Polonius , that one may have the politest of manners and still be a deadening bore .

		THE GILDED MAN .

		By
Clifford Smyth	PERSON	.


Boni	PERSON	and
Liveright	PERSON	.

		There is a thick coating of science around this romancer 's pill .

		You are beguiled by what is essen - tially a fairy story but a fairy story in which the conjuration is duly accounted for , instead of being left to the haphazard brandishing of a wand .

		Thus Dr.
Snayth	PERSON	tunnels through the heart of a legend , using the edged tools of the psychologist and the physicist to heighten the apparent verity of the myth .

		In this manner the reader is adroitly led into unquestioning if somewhat temporary ac - ceptance of the highly-colored ingredients , not one of which is introduced without the coating of scien - tific incantation .

		This method of writing , coupled with a vivid and sure-footed style , results in a piece of fiction which sustains the curiosity rather than the higher faculties of the mind .

		One reads on with the consciousness that one 's reward is destined to be nothing more permanent than a demolished question mark .

		Dr.
Smyth	PERSON	was for some years American consul at
Carthagena	LOCATION	, and there gleaned the ancient echoes of that
El Dorado	LOCATION	, the search foi which is in part the motive force of the presem romance .

		With its color and suspense and action The Gilded Man will appeal especially to thos < who prize a novel in proportion to their inability to lay it down .

Plato	ORGANIZATION	, which
M. C. Otto	PERSON	recommended in his communication in the previous issue of THE .

		DIAL , was published by the
Charles H. Kerr Co.	PERSON	,
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		It will be of interest to many inquirers that
Frank Tannenbaum	PERSON	's article The Moral
Devasta	PERSON	- tion of War , as printed in THE DIAL of
April 5	DATE	, was read in manuscript to several officers and to 200 soldiers .

		They endorsed it and urged its pub - lication .

		The Annual Convention of the American Book - sellers ' Association is to be held this year at the
Copley Plaza Hotel	ORGANIZATION	,

May 13	DATE	, 14 , and 15 .

		Mr.
Hulings C. Brown	PERSON	, of Little ,
Brown	PERSON	and
Co.	ORGANIZATION	, chairman of the committee on arrangements , re - quests that booksellers planning to attend the con - vention communicate with him at 34 Beacon Street ,
Boston	LOCATION	.

		As an advance souvenir of the convention , the
Penn Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
Philadelphia	LOCATION	5 is sending out , upon request , complimentary copies of a holi - day edition of
Robert Shackleton	PERSON	's The Book of
Boston	LOCATION	.

		A two-act phantasy , The Lost Pleiad , by
Jane Dransfield	PERSON	-LRB-
James T. White	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has made its tardy way into type after being first performed some eight years ago .

		Miss
Dransfield	ORGANIZATION	has handled hef blank verse without trepidation , and has succeeded in giving a really graceful setting to the ancient myth of the Pleiad who came to earth to marry the first King of
Corinth	LOCATION	.

		Disclaiming any intent to pattern after Greek models , she has reproduced the spirit of the myth in a somewhat modern fashion .

		Pert passages rub elbows with the poetic , but the effect is informal rather than dis - pleasing .

		The Gentleman Ranker and Other Plays , by the actor
Leon Gordon	PERSON	-LRB- Four Seas ;
Boston	LOCATION	-RRB- , contains a stereotyped melodrama of the campaign against the German Colonies , a one-act detective play of some ingenuity written in collaboration with
Charles King	PERSON	, and a short cockney farce well suited for amateur dramatics all three bristling with the wooden tricks of the conventional actor .


Emma Beatrice Brunner	PERSON	commands a smoother technique .

		In Bits of Background in One Act Plays -LRB- Knopf -RRB- she has written one very clever sketch , Strangers , and three others which do not carry so well solely because their themes are less intriguing .

		To
Christopher Morley	PERSON	one might easily apply the title of his recent book of light verse .

		He is the rocking horse among the younger American writers .

		In Shandygaff -LRB-
Doubleday	ORGANIZATION	, Page -RRB- he lurched forward as a delightful enterprising essayist : in The Rocking Horse -LRB-
Doran	PERSON	-RRB- he sidles back to a rather unsteady singing of the well-known joys of the suburban home-builder .

		He seems to feel that
Joyce Kilmer	PERSON	's efforts in that field should be sec - onded , but it is a hard pasture in which to turn up fresh earth .

		And by collecting these poems in book he has lost the advantage they held as light magazine verse that of coming in small doses anc of contrast with the other subject matter .

		Apparently Christian Internationalism , by Wil liam
Pierson Merrill	PERSON	-LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is a course oi war-sermons : possibly it is a series of essays with the accepted homiletical technique .

		The author is typically American optimist of the pre-war type , He puts his faith in existing institutions , such as the League to
Enforce Peace	ORGANIZATION	,
the World Alliance foi International Friendship	ORGANIZATION	through the Churches , and the
National Committee	ORGANIZATION	on the Churches and the Moral Aims of the War .

		He seems to feel that we already have a practically Christian national - ism to which we have only to add a Christian internationalism .

NEW YORK	LOCATION	When writing to advertisers please mention THE DIAL .

		THE DIAL A FORTNIGHTLY Peace I NTEMPERATE CRITICISM has diligently sought to find fault with the covenant which has been devised and underwritten by the deputies of the great powers .

		The criticism has been animated and vol - uble , but it has been singularly futile on the whole .

		At the same time the spokesmen of this covenant show a singular lack of assurance ; they speak in a tone of doubtful hope rather than enthusiastic con - viction .

		And the statesmen who set up this cov - enant do so with such an engaging air of modesty and furtive apprehension as should engender a spirit of good will and fellowship in the presenta - tion of a doubtfully hopeful enterprise , rather than obstructive tactics and intemperate criticism .

		They are saying , in effect : We have done the best we could under the circumstances .

		It is a great pity that we have been able to do no better .

		Let us hope for the best , and God help us all !

		The best must always be good enough , and the Covenant is the best that the political wisdom of the three continents has been able to find in a five months ' search for ways and means of avoiding war .

		But this best will always have the defects of its qualities .

		And such defects as still attach to the Covenant will best be understood , and may there - fore best be condoned and allowed for , when seen in the light of its qualities .

		Now , as for its qualities , the Covenant is a political document , an instrument of realpolitik , created in the image of nineteenth century imperialism .

		It has been set up by political statesmen , on political grounds , for political ends , and with political apparatus to be used with political effect .

		It brings to a focus the best and highest tra - ditions of commercialized nationalism , but also it brings nothing else .

		The outcome is a political covenant which even its friends and advocates view with an acute sense of its inability , perhaps rather a sense of its total vacuity .

		Its defect is not that the Covenant falls short , but rather that it is quite beside the point .

		The point is the avoidance of war , at all costs ; the war arose unavoidably out of the political status quo ; the
Covenant	ORGANIZATION	reestablishes the status quo , with some additional political apparatus supplied from the same shop .

		True to the political tradition , the
Covenant	ORGANIZATION	provides for enforcing the peace by recourse to arms and commercial hostilities , but it contemplates no measures for avoiding war by avoiding the status quo out of which the great war arose .

		The status quo was a status of commercialized nationalism .

		The traditions which bind them will not permit anything beyond these political ends , ways , and means of commercialized nationalism to come within the cognizance of the competence of these elder statesmen who have had this work to do .

		So there is no help for it .

		But the
Covenant	ORGANIZATION	is after all the best that was reasonably to be looked for .

		It embodies the best and highest traditions of nineteenth century states - manship .

		That it does so , that it is conceived in the spirit of Mid-Victorian liberalism rather than in the spirit of Mid-European imperialism , is to be set down to the account of
America	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	's President .

		But that it remains standing as a left - over on that outworn ground , instead of coming up abreast of the twentieth century is also to be credited to the same power .

		It is in an eminent sense
America	LOCATION	's Covenant , made and provided by the para - mount advice and consent of
America	LOCATION	's President , And this paramount advice and consent has gone to the making of the
Covenant	ORGANIZATION	in the simple faith that commercialized nationalism answereth all things .

		The unfortunate , and unfortunately decisive , cir - cumstance of the case is , therefore , that the Presi - dent 's outlook and ideals are in this way grounded in the political traditions of Mid-Victorian liberalism , and that his advisers have been animated with po - litical traditions of a still narrower and more anti- quated make .

		Hence the difficulties which arise out of a new industrial situation and a consequent new bias of the popular temper are sought to be adjusted by readjusting the political status quo ante .

		Now , it should be plain to anyone on slight re - flection that this covanant has been forced upon the politicians by the present state of the industrial sys - tem .

		The great war has run its course within the confines of this industrial system , and it has become evident that no nation is competent henceforth THE DIAL
May 17	DATE	single-handed to take care of its own case within this system , in which all the civilized peoples are bound up together .

		And it should be similarly plain , on similarly slight reflection , that no readjust - ment of working arrangements among the peoples concerned can hope to touch the core of the diffi - culties unless its scope is the same as that of the in - dustrial system and unless it is carried out with a single-handed regard to the industrial requirements of the case , and coupled with a thoroughgoing dis - allowance of those political and nationalist prece - dents and ambitions ' that hinder the free working of this industrial system .

		The interval since Mid - Victorian time has been a period of unexampled change in the industrial arts and in the working arrangements necessary to indus - trial production .

		The productive industry of all the civilized peoples has been drawn together by the continued advance of the industrial arts into a single comprehensive , close-knit system , a network of me - chanically balanced give and take , such that no nation and no community can now carry on its own industrial affairs in severally or at cross-purposes with the rest except at the cost of a disproportionate derangement and hardship to itself and to all the rest .

		All this is simple and obvious to those who are at all familiar with the technical requirements of production .

		To all such it is well known that for the purposes of productive industry , and therefore for the purposes of popular welfare and content , national divisions are nothing better than haphazard divisions of an indivisible whole , arbitrary and ob - structive .

		And because of this state of things , any regulation or diversion of trade or industry within any one of these national units is of graver conse - quence to all the others than to itself .

		Yet the Cov - enant contemplates no abatement of that obsructive nationalist intrigue that makes the practical .

		sub - stance of the `` self-determination of nations . ''

		At the same time , that which chiefly hampers the everyday work of industrial production and chiefly tries the popular temper under this new order of things is the increasingly obstructive and increasingly irresponsible control of production by the vested in - terests of commerce and finance , seeking each their own profit at the cost of the underlying population .

		Yet the
Covenant	ORGANIZATION	contemplates no abatement of these vested interests that are fast approaching the limit of popular tolerance ; for the
Covenant	ORGANIZATION	is a political instrument , made and provided for the re - habilitation of Mid-Victorian political intrigue and for the upkeep of the vested interests of commerce and finance .

		The cry of the common man has been : What shall we do to be saved from war abroad and dissension at home ?

		And the answer given in the Covenant is the good old answer of the elder statesmen of the Old Order provision of armed force sufficient to curb any uneasy drift of senti - ment among the underlying populace , with the due advice and consent of the dictatorship established by the elder statesmen .

		Now , the great war was precipitated by the malign growth of just such a commercialized na - tionalism within this industrial system , and was fought to a successful issue as a struggle of industrial forces and with the purpose of establishing an endur - ing peace of industrial prosperity and content ; at least so they say .

		It should accordingly have seemed reasonable to entrust the settlement to those men who know something about the working and re - quirements of this industrial system on which the welfare of mankind finally turns .

		To any man whose perspective is not confined within the Mid - Victorian political traditions , it would seem that the first move toward an enduring peace would be abatement of the vested interests and national pre - tensions wherever they touch the conduct of in - dustry ; and the men to do this work should logically be those who know the needs of the industrial sys - tem and are not biased by commercial incentives .

		An enduring settlement should be entrusted to reas - onably unbiased production engineers , rather than to the awestruck political lieutenants of the vested interests .

		These men , technical specialists , over - workmen , skilled foremen of the system , are expert in the ways and means of industry and know some - thing of the material conditions of life that sur - round the common man , at the same time that they are familiar with the available resources and the uses to which they are to be turned .

		Of necessity in war and peace , it is for these workmen of the top line to take care of the industrial system and its working , so far as the obstructive tactics of the vested interests and the commercial statesmen will permit ; for without their constant supervision and correction this highly technical system of production will not work at all .

		Logically it should be for these and their like to frame such a settlement as will bind the civilized peoples together on an amic - able footing as a going concern , engaged on a joint industrial enterprise .

		However , it is not worth while to speculate on what they and their like might propose , since neither they nor their counsels have had any part in the Covenant .

		The Covenant is a covenant of commercialized nationalism , without afterthought .

		To return to the facts : The great war was fought out and peace was brought within sight by teamwork of the soldiers and workmen and the political per - sonnel .

		The cost , the work , and hardship fell on
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 487 the soldiers and workmen , and it is also chiefly their fortune that is now in the balance .

		The political personnel have lost nothing , risked nothing , and have nothing at stake on the chance of further war or peace .

		But in these deliberations on peace the political personnel alone have had a voice .

		Neither those who have done the necessary righting at the front nor those who have done the necessary work at home have had any part in it all .

		The conference has been a conclave made up of the spokesmen of commercialized nationalism , in effect a conclave of the political lieutenants of the political lieutenants of the vested interests .

		In short , there have been no Soldiers ' and Workmen 's Deputies included in this Soviet of the
Elder Statesmen	ORGANIZATION	which has conferred the dictatorship on the political deputies of the vested interests .

		By and large , neither the wishes nor the welfare of the soldiers , the workmen , or the industrial system as a going concern , have visibly been consulted in the drafting of this Covenant .

		However , to avoid all appearance of graceless over - statement , it should perhaps be noted in qualification that the American workmen may be alleged to have been represented at this court of elder statesmen , in - formally , unofficially , and irresponsibly , by the sex - ton beadle of the A. F. of L. , but it will be admitted that this qualification makes no serious inroad on the broader statement above .

		Neither the value nor the cost of this Covenant are fairly to be appreciated apart from its back - ground and the purposes and interests which are moving in the background .

		As it now looms up against this murky background of covert agreements covertly arrived at during the past months , the '' Covenant is beginning to look like a last desperate concert of crepuscular statesmanship for the preser - vation of the civilized world 's kept classes and vested interests in the face of a menacing situation .

		There - fore , in case the Covenant should yet prove to be so lasting and serve this turn so well as materially to deflect the course of events , what is likely to be of material consequence to the fortunes of mankind is chiefly the outcome of this furtive traffic in other men 's good between the deputies of the great powers , which underlies and conditions the stilted formalities of the instrument itself .

		Little is known , and perhaps less is intended to be known , of this furtive traffic in other men 's goods .

		Hitherto the `` High Contracting Parties '' have been at pains to give out no '' information which might be useful to the enemy . ''

		What and how many covert agreements have been covertly arrived at during these four or five months of diplomatic twilight will not be known for some time yet .

		A decent cover still hides what may be hidden , which is presumably just as well .

		And yet , even if one had best not see him face to face , one may still infer something as to the nature of the beast from the shape of his hoof .

		A little something in that way is coming in sight now in the shameful transaction by which the politicians and vested in - terests of
Japan	LOCATION	are given a burglarious free hand in northern
China	LOCATION	; and it would be both graceless and idle to speculate on what may be the grand total of gruesome enormities which the Oriental states - men will have undertaken to perpetrate or overlook , for the benefit of the vested interests identified with the European powers , in consideration of that carte blanche of indecency .

		So also is the arrangement between the great powers for the suppression of
Soviet Russia	LOCATION	, for the profit of the vested interests identified with these Powers and at the cost of the underlying population ; the due parceling out of con - cessions and natural resources in foreign parts , inci - dent to that convention of smuggled warfare , will doubtless have consumed a formidable total of time , ingenuity , and effrontery .

		But the Covenant being an instrument of commercialized nationalism , all these things have had to be seen to .

		4 88 THE DIAL
May 17	DATE	Quo Vadis ?

		Ao GO FROM ENGLAND on the morrow of the elec - tions , and the eve of the miners ' and railway men 's strikes , to the
Conference	ORGANIZATION	in
Paris	LOCATION	, and from that to the meeting of the resuscitated Internationale in
Berne	LOCATION	, is to get a pretty fair bird 's - eye view , so far as externals can give that view , of the factors of European politics at this moment .

		Let us note cer - tain outstanding features of this political landscape .

		There can be no doubt of a general condition of widespread upheaval in
England	LOCATION	.

		Strikes are with - out number .

		They are for demands such as a six - hour day that a year or two ago would have been regarded as outrageous .

		In his opening speech of the session the British Prime Minister said that while he was in
Paris	LOCATION	he received every morning on going to the Conference a telegram announcing some new strike , and found another such telegram on returning in the
evening	TIME	.

		And what is notable is the apparent triviality of the pretext for strike .

		The whole industrial life of the country is embar - rassed because of a disagreement over the dinner hour of railway men .

		And the authority of the Trades Unions themselves is flouted : bargains made by the Unions with the employers are disregarded ; strikes which have been forbidden by the Unions take place .

		Fact number one then : a widespread revolution - ary mood , a readiness to take extreme measures on behalf of minor aims .

		Papers like the
Daily Express	ORGANIZATION	represent the whole strike movement as the work of a minority of Bolshevists aiming at the overturn of the state .

		The
Times	ORGANIZATION	gives evidence to show that the leaders are political revolutionaries of ex - treme type .

		What these papers seem to overlook is that they themselves have for four years been sedu - lously cultivating a revolutionary mood of a kind .

		Every day they told us that we were righting for a new world .

		Never was anything to be quite the same again ; the old diplomacy was dead .

		While Mr.
Webb	PERSON	talked to us of a new social order Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	and his friends talked of a new political world order .

		Just latterly
the Daily Mail	ORGANIZATION	has been printing every morning articles in supporf of an organized internationalism which might have been written by
David Starr Jordan	PERSON	, or
Bertrand Russell	PERSON	, or
Lowes Dickinson	PERSON	, or
Henry Brailsford	PERSON	.

		One rubbed one 's eyes .

		Here was revolution indeed .

		Those who ventured to write in this strain before the war were held up by the Daily Mail itself either as plain traitors playing the game of
Germany	LOCATION	, or hopeless cranks refusing to face the hard facts of the world about them .

		It is true that in
Paris	LOCATION	one found official
France	LOCATION	resenting this diplomatic revolution , but not pub - licly resisting , and great masses were accepting , passively it may be , but still accepting , the Wilsonian policy .

		.

		In
Berne	LOCATION	one still found early in
February	DATE	- the federal capital of
Switzerland	LOCATION	resounding with the echoes of the Bolshevist coup d'etat of
November	DATE	an attempt on the part of the extremer Socialists to seize the government and create a revolution by means of a general strike an attempt of which the world heard very little because it happened to coincide with the
Armistice	ORGANIZATION	.

		But it was a very serious business indeed for
Switzerland	LOCATION	: for three days the members of the federal government were virtual prisoners in the
Bellevue	LOCATION	Palace Hotel and the whole army was placed on a war footing .

		-LRB- Incidentally the land-owning peasants , very con - servative , very anti-town , were , so it is very com - monly believed , extremely anxious to demonstrate the excellence of that shooting which is the feature of his military training in which the peasant takes most pride . -RRB-

		And then of course here on the bor - ders of
Germany	LOCATION	, with Germans going to and fro with relative freedom and ex-German and Austrian royalties escaping to Swiss villas and hotels , one heard a good deal of the German revolution in which in a few days dynasties which had lasted a thousand years vanished from the face of the earth .

		Here then undoubtedly was a world in revolution , boiling and seething in order to throw out the elements of the old order and to take on an entirely new form .

		That however is only one aspect of the case .

		There is a contrary and conflicting aspect .

		This
England	LOCATION	, of a mood so revolutionary that the very Unionists are rebelling against their Unions , has just had an election .

		At that election a great
Labor Party	ORGANIZATION	appeared as definitely repre - senting the new social order .

		The English Consti - tution would have permitted here , at one step , the capture of a political power which , , without inter - fering Supreme Courts , would have enabled organ - ized labor to enter into its own : to nationalize the mines and railways , hand them over to the Unions for management , make an end of the old diplo - matic methods in international affairs , and make of the settlement of
Paris	LOCATION	the beginnings of a new world organization based upon the union of the peoples .

		Well , this revolutionary
England	LOCATION	, ready apparently in one mood to paralyze the nation 's in - dustrial life in order to enforce some point about THE DIAL 489 the length of the dinner hour , did not trouble to vote at all in an election which could have given it the foundations , at least , of this new social order everybody had been talking about .

		At a juncture of the world 's affairs more momentous than any perhaps which mankind has known in writ - ten history , at a time when the character of a popu - lar judgment might affect the character of our civilization during whole centuries , half the British people stayed away from the polls .

		The very men who went to the war , risking their lives , lying , some of them , half - disemboweled through nights of hell in the Flanders mud in order that international treaties might be respected , that their children might '' never again '' know this thing -LRB- insert here the per - oration of ten thousand impassioned speeches , ser - mons , poems , editorials of four years of war -RRB- these men , most of them perhaps , declined to trou - ble about recording their vote at all .

		They seem to have decided to leave it to their womenkind , to whom that sort of thing was a new amusement .

		With the result that there are excluded from the Parliament of the new
Britain	LOCATION	, which '' has swept away forever the obsolete order which '' -LRB- insert again quotations from the perorations of ten thous - and speeches -RRB- , all those who have been notable for their thoroughgoing radicalism and constructive work towards the new order .

		Mr.
Sidney Webb	PERSON	himself , draughtsman of the Charter of the New So - cial Order , is rejected by
London University	ORGANIZATION	, which has been the scene of so much of his labor .

		In this Parliament of the Revolution power is placed in the hands of Mr.
Bonar	PERSON	Law !

		And in the international field this new
Britain	LOCATION	marks its sense of the degree to which old diplomatic methods have disappeared and an entirely new method of handling international affairs inaugurated , by sending , as one of the prin - cipal members in Mr.
George	PERSON	's absence the head of the British delegation ,
Lord Milner	PERSON	.

		Lord
Milner	PERSON	, the reader need hardly be reminded , is an administrator of German training and partly Ger - man descent , whose Prussian settlement in
South Africa	LOCATION	had to be undone by the Liberal Government of Campbell-Bannermann ; whose conservative habit of mind , particularly in international affairs , has never been disguised , whose skepticism concerning what may be called Wilsonian methods is notorious .

		He is perhaps the one public man in
Britain	LOCATION	most certain to adhere to principles and ideas which it was supposed to be the task of the Conference to do away with .

		The pessimism of Liberals and radicals in close touch with the
Conference	ORGANIZATION	concerning the possibility of any real change of the old diplomatic attitude has now become pretty well known : French and Italian insistence upon the fulfilment of secret treaties ,
Clemenceau	PERSON	's and
Orlando	LOCATION	's very open de - fense of the old system of alliances , the ill concealed contempt for the political ideology which would attempt to do away with them ; the French attitude to
Russia	LOCATION	, the Italian to Jugo-Slavia , the very frank hostility even of the French press itself to publicity of debate at the
Conference	ORGANIZATION	these are but a few of the numberless facts which show that the old order , its spirit and method , still dominate the management of international affairs .

		But at the
Berne Socialist Conference	ORGANIZATION	?

		Surely here at least would be found a definite and radical break with the principles of the past insisted upon by men who knew what they wanted a revolutionary program in fact ?

		Well , a young radical at the close of the
Conference	ORGANIZATION	having attended all its sessions summed it up in these terms : The Conference professed to be the most advanced ex - pression of Internationalism and Socialism .

		You need only look at the reports of the debates and read its reso - lutions to see that it is neither Internationalist nor Social - ist .

		It is not Internationalist , in that national passions blazed out at every turn , and great Socialistic figures like
Albert Thomas	PERSON	and Renaudel practically never spoke ex - cept to express a national point of view .

		Look at the resolutions .

		Is there one that deals with the method of abolishing the present capitalist system ?

		Not one .

		Yet that was the supposed raison d'etre of the
Conference	ORGANIZATION	.

		The place has been positively swamped with the litera - ture of Czecho-Slovak , Jugo-Slav , Armenian , Georgian , Roumanian , Greek ,
Lettish	LOCATION	, Esthonian , Ukrainian , Fin - nish national claims there have literally been tons of it distributed during the Conference .

		Not one single leaf - let , so far as I know , has there been on industrial inter - nationalism or the social revolution .

		And in the ques - tions with which the
Conference	ORGANIZATION	did deal
League ^ of Nations	ORGANIZATION	for instance it showed itself no more radical than Lord
Robert Cecil	PERSON	or the other people in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		In one vital particular only that of parliamentary rep - resentation did it go in definite proposals beyond the
Paris	LOCATION	Conference , and that was so much an afterthought that it had to be introduced as an amendment .

		Who have been the dominating figures at the Conference ?

		Branting and
Arthur Henderson	PERSON	about as suggestive of revolution as Lord
Rothschild	PERSON	or the
Archbishop of Canterbury	ORGANIZATION	.

		The excommunication of the Conference pronounced , not only by the Russian but even by the Swiss Bolshevists , has been from their point of view entirely justified .

		Very well then , one concludes , with his eye on this group of facts the deliberate election of a Tory Government in
England	LOCATION	; the docility with which is accepted the representation at this juncture of the democracies by men like
Milner	PERSON	,
Cecil	PERSON	, Bal - four , Bourgeois ,
Clemenceau	LOCATION	,
Orlando	LOCATION	,
Sonnino	PERSON	; '' revolutionary '' conferences of the kind just de - scribed it is evident , in view of al ^ this , that
Entente Europe	LOCATION	is in no revolutionary mood , and that it will stand by a steady and orderly develop - ment .

		And then one reads of the British strikes , where these sober British workmen who voted for Lord
Milner	PERSON	throw the whole country into industrial chaos because they have a grievance about the dinner 49 THE DIAL
May 17	DATE	hour .

		And it is not just a momentary explosion .

		The thing is indicative of what has been going on for months ; it is symptomatic of something wide - spread and chronic .

		What does it mean ?

		This much is clear : we can not make any reliable estimate of forces at work unless we take the two apparently contradictory tendencies into considera - tion .

		How can they be reconciled ?

		Here is a guess : Normally the mass of a busy people , concerned with its own individual daily work and troubles and pre - occupations , is inert in political matters .

		That inertia can not be stirred by forces that lack psycho - logical stimulus , that are undramatic mere argu - ment and exhortation that require cold intellectual decisions arrived at by painful and unexciting ratio - cinative processes to give them effect .

		An election , a matter of argument , speeches , votes , leaves the mass relatively cold , except where its emotions can be stirred .

		This is done most easily by appeals to the old and familiar sentiments of nationalism , hatred of the enemy .

		Certainly so unfamiliar a thing as the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	does not profoundly stir it .

		But this relatively inert mass , absorbed in its own affairs , can readily feel the stimulus of an action which it can follow or imitate .

		To do something that other people are doing is a good deal easier than to think out painfully opinions and decisions which may differ from those of others .

		A strike is such an action , easily followed ; the expression of opinion through a vote on the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	and the abolition of the old diplomacy , involving difficult questions as to why the old diplomacy should be abolished and why the balance of power and national forces are insufficient , implies an in - tellectual activity before which an overworked miner or railroad man quails .

		The laborer feels himself done out of his dinner hour ; that is something near to him , understandable ; he is angry .

		The suggested remedy is one he is familiar with and the efficacy of which he can understand .

		And it is action like righting , a relief to the feelings .

		But this voting about foreign policy in
Paris	LOCATION	that may have im - portance twenty years hence .

		Why should he have any feeling about that ?

		`` And the
Boche	PERSON	should be made to pay up , as
Hughes	PERSON	says ; Hughes talks about the
Boche	ORGANIZATION	in a way a man who has lost a son in the war can understand .

		Makes a man 's blood boil .

		And now a lot of blighters who made pots of money out of the war want to do a man out of his dinner hour ! ''

		And if in this mood two or three active resolute men come to a hundred and say they are going to strike , and ask the others to join them why , in most cases they will , though except for such a lead the hundred would have gone on working without question .

		And thus it is that an active minority can secure revolutionary action a tremendous movement for ends and results that of themselves are small .

		And action which is the result of motives and impulses of that kind is apt to be sporadic , localized , undis - ciplined , without centralized direction .

		The action is not on behalf of any large predetermined pro- gram ; it '' breaks out '' spontaneously , impulsively a temperamental manifestation .

		The final state is not one of revolution large masses moving against a common enemy on behalf of a conscious political program .

		Rather is it confusion , one group taking a line which runs counter to that taken by another group .

		The men who strike about a din - ner hour are not impelled by revolutionary ideas or visions of a new social order , but by motives much less rationalized .

		And the situation would be a good deal more hopeful if the movement were more revolutionary , in the sense of being impelled by a vision of social revolution , and less tempera - mental and subconscious .


Francis Bacon	PERSON	remarked some centuries since that truth came out of error more easily than out of confusion .

		If a man has on some subject a clear - cut theory definitely wrong , he will , as Huxley re - marked , have the great good fortune one day of banging his head against a fact ; and that , if he is honest , sets him straight again .

		But the man who will not clearly rationalize his beliefs at all , but , again as
Huxley	LOCATION	puts it , goes buzzing about unre - flectingly between right and wrong , comes out no - where .

		Something analogous is true in politics .

		If there were a conscious , concerted revolutionary move - ment , leaders - knowing what they wanted , with a predetermined program of a new social order , mar - shaling forces on one side ; while on the other there were the forces of the old order , also knowing what they wanted , then one or the other would impose its will , and we should be able to live , tant bien que mal , by one system or the other .

		The traffic would be going either to the left or the right .

		And the question as to whether it should go to the right or the left is after all much less important than that everybody should do one thing or the other .

		The fatal thing most provocative of dreadful smashes is that sometimes folk go one way , sometimes the other , with no rule , but just as the spirit moves them .

		In that sort of confu - sion nobody can go into the streets in safety .

		And it is this confusion , the absence of any working theory , not the supremacy of one revolutionary theory however wild , that threatens the world .

		In the political world in general outside the industrial field of miners and railway men a simi - lar absence of conscious political principle or theory
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 491 is leading to a similar condition of instability , of incalculable unrest , of movements that are deter - mined not by conscious efforts towards a discerned goal but by unconscious impulse .

		One reads these speeches from statesmen of the old school in favor of a society of nations , and the self-determination of small peoples , and the respect of the weak by the strong ; these Daily Mail editorials expressing sen - timents of pacific internationalism which , but a few years since , the same paper was holding up to fero - cious contempt .

		One might assume that the public had undergone a great conversion , had seen a great light , thus to embrace this revolutionary doctrine of the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	with its surrender of national sovereignty and independence , the privilege of imposing our will upon others by means of our superior might and virtue .

		But there is no such moral revolution ; the public is quite unaware of having surrendered anything or changed any opinion .

		It follows an active lead like that of
Wilson	PERSON	as tomorrow it will follow a contrary lead , if some turn of political circumstance should render it worth while for an active minority to furnish it .

		And statesmen and newspapers would turn from inter - nationalism to intense nationalism and all its moral connotations , from talking of '' the great ideals so nobly expressed '' to talking of '' the debasing sen - timentality of an emasculate pacifism , '' without blinking ; and the great mass of their readers would soon be completely unaware of any change what - soever .

		Put down thus nakedly the thing seems an af - fected overstatement , or an effort at cynicism .

		But it is neither .

		This change from one political philo - sophy to a contrary one within a few weeks has been abundantly illustrated in the last year or two in both
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	.

		For the first eighteen months of the war nearly all
America	LOCATION	drew an un - compromisingly pacifist argument from the war ; it was the period of '' I did not raise my boy to be a soldier '' ; of the Democratic party 's claim for support on the ground that '' it kept the country out of war . ''

		Within a few months the author of '' I did not raise ... '' was writing to the papers to explain that the song was really written for the purpose of promoting the selective draft ; great communities that voted by the hundred-thou - sand against
America	LOCATION	's participation in war were in a few months lynching those who were supposed not to favor the war .

		In such things as our atti - tude to
Russia	LOCATION	we have displayed the same moral gymnastics .

		For two years no word of criticism of
Czarist Russia	LOCATION	was permitted in the French or English press ; the papers abounded with touching stories of the gentleness and nobility of the Russian people .

		Today no good word for
Soviet Russia	LOCATION	can be printed in that same press .

		It is part of the condition which enables a
Durham	LOCATION	miner to vote for Mr.
Bonar	PERSON	Law today and for the aboli - tion of private property in mines and a syndicalist revolution tomorrow .

		And if this waywardness marks a people possessed of the self-confidence , the encouragement , that comes of victory , what may we not look for in the enemy people whose future is so uncertain , who can not , however disciplined and concerted their action , de - termine that future , since they are within the power of others ?

		Is it to be wondered that each gives himself to the impulse of the moment ?

		`` Revolu - tion '' would imply a set and common purpose , a discerned goal , and that would give us some hope .

		But those things do not mark the course of events .

		There 's no discernible goal .

		Quo vadis ?


NORMAN ANGELL	PERSON	.


Joel Chandler Harris	PERSON	and Negro Folklore IN UNCLE REMUS RETURNS -LRB-
Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	;
Boston	LOCATION	-RRB- we meet our old friend
Remus	PERSON	and the same little boy who appears in Told by Uncle Remus the son of the boy who listened to the earlier tales and of a mother most antipathetic to Uncle Remus ,
Miss Sally	PERSON	, and Mr.
Harris	PERSON	.

		That the little boy should be shown to be so exclusively the product of his mother 's theory of education is , by the way , a naive witness to the unfortunate in - significance of the father in the American family .

		The little boy is singularly lacking in the child 's usual protective devices against education .

		But Mr.
Harris	PERSON	had caught the folk-tale spirit , keeping to the expected theme or emotion or trait .

		Prig - gishness is the outcome of a quasi-scientific educa - tion , held
Harris	PERSON	, and so his little boy in this last picture of him at any rate is consistently a prig ^ The stories the child listens to there are six of them consist of the familiar colloquies between '' the animals , superimposed upon folk-tales or near - folk-tales .

		Impty-Umpty and the
Blacksmith	LOCATION	is a variant of the tale known to readers of
Grimm	LOCATION	as Grandfather Death .

		It has been collected in
New England	LOCATION	from Portuguese Negroes , but it has not been recorded before , so far as I know , in the South .

		Mr.
Ridgeley Torrence	PERSON	tells me however that the tale is widely spread among
American Negroes	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Most Beautiful Bird in the World appears to be 492 THE DIAL
May 17	DATE	a variant of The Birds Take Back Their Feathers , recorded in
Jamaica	LOCATION	, in
New England	LOCATION	from
Portu	LOCATION	- guese Negroes , and further evidence of its Hispanic provenience in the
Southwest	LOCATION	from the
Pueblo Indians	LOCATION	.

		Brother Rabbit , Brother Fox , and Two Fat Pullets consists of the European pattern of the false message or letter , the same pattern which ap - pears in the earlier Remus tales of Brother Rabbit and the Little Girl , and In Some Lady 's Garden , and in a tale which was once told me in
Newport	LOCATION	,
Rhode Island	LOCATION	, by a white woman from the
Azores	LOCATION	.

		How Brother
Rabbit Brought Family Trouble on Brother Fox	ORGANIZATION	is reminiscent likewise of Portuguese tales that I have listened to in
New England	LOCATION	.

		A. variant of Taily-po I heard on
Andros Island	LOCATION	,
Bahamas	LOCATION	, and what is probably another variant
Chatelain	PERSON	heard in
Angola	LOCATION	,
West Africa	LOCATION	.

		Brother Rabbit 's Bear Hunt contains a less well defined pattern than the other tales in the volume and , like some of the earlier Remus tales , it is , I suspect , one of those quasi-individualistic pieces of embroidery with familiar material which are not uncommonly forthcoming among Negro story-tellers and which may or may not develop into a true folk-tale .

		To what extent does Mr.
Harris	PERSON	himself em - broider ?

		In more than one of those very pleasant letters which are printed in the recently published biography by
Julia Collier Harris	PERSON	-LRB- The Life and Letters of
Joel Chandler Harris	PERSON	.

		Houghton Mif - flin ;
Boston	LOCATION	-RRB- Mr.
Harris	PERSON	refers to himself as merely a compiler of the Remus tales .

		In a letter in particular written to
Gomme	LOCATION	, president of the
Folk Lore Society	ORGANIZATION	in
England	LOCATION	, but with character - istic diffidence not sent , Mr.
Harris	PERSON	stated of the tales that '' not one of them is cooked , and not one nor any part of one is an invention of mine .

		They are all genuine folk-tales . ''

		That they are indeed folk-tales , at least the earlier tales , any folk - lorist will agree , or in fact anyone who takes the trouble to compare them with another collection made in
Georgia	LOCATION	, the excellent collection of
C. C. Jones	PERSON	, Jr. , called Negro Myths from the
Georgia Coast	ORGANIZATION	, or with Mrs.
Christensen	PERSON	's collection from the
Sea Islands of South Carolina	LOCATION	, or with our meager collections from other parts of the South or from the
West Indies	LOCATION	.

		But in making this comparison it becomes quite evident that just as Mr.
Harris	PERSON	preserved the pat - tern of the tale very faithfully , so the setting -LRB- I refer not only to the old man and the little boy , but to the animal colloquies and to the developed con - cept of the animal community -RRB- is a thing apart , not appearing in any of the other recorded tales .

		In the
Harris	PERSON	biography there is likewise testimony of , in this respect , the literary character of the tales .

		In
1883	DATE	in requesting a friend at
Darien	LOCATION	, a
Georgia	LOCATION	coast town , to get him some characteristic coast tales , varying from the cotton plantation tales of the interior , tales for example about alligators , Mr.
Harris	PERSON	particularizes : '' All I want is a reason - ably intelligent outline of the stories as the Negroes tell them . ''

		That is , he might have said , he wanted the pattern ; its setting he himself would supply .

		A definite illustration of the distribution of folk - lore and literature in the Remus tales is presented in the biography .

		A correspondent from
Senoia	LOCATION	,
Georgia	LOCATION	, wrote : Mr.
Harris	PERSON	I have one tale of Uncle Remus that I have not seen in print yet .

		Bro Rabbit at
Mis Meadows	ORGANIZATION	and Bro Bare went to
Bro Rabbit	ORGANIZATION	house and eat up his chil - drun and set his house on fire and make like the childrun all burnt up but
Bro Rabbit	PERSON	saw his track he knowed Bro Bare was the man so one day
Bro Rabbit	ORGANIZATION	saw Bro Bare in the woods with his ax hunting a bee tree after Bro Rabbit spon howdy he tell Bro Bare he know whare a bee tree was and he would go an show and help him cut it down they went and cut it an Bro Rabbit drove in the glut while Bro Bare push his head in the hole
Bro Rabbit	LOCATION	nock out the glut and cut him hickry .

		Mr.
Harris	PERSON	you have the tale now give it ivit I never had room to give you all you can finish it .

		This tale , writes the biographer , was the source of The End of Mr.
Bear	PERSON	, in the first of the Remus books .

		Reread this tale and you will agree with Mr.
Harris	PERSON	that the tales were '' not written as folklore stories . ''

		As it may be urged however that the tale from
Senoia	LOCATION	was merely a written '' outline , '' as the bio - grapher calls it , and not a reproduction of the tale as told by Negroes , I am tempted to give the tale of the
Forgotten Pass-Word	ORGANIZATION	, of which this
Senoia	LOCATION	-
Harris	PERSON	tale seems to be a variant , as the former was taken down this year from the lips of a
Sea Islander	LOCATION	.

		Ber
Wolf	PERSON	he fin ' a honey tree .

		So he call Ber Rabbit , `` Le ' go get some honey . ''

		So dey went to de tree .

		De honey commence to come down .

		Dey could n't get it so very free .

		But anyhow dey bu ` st de tree wid de axe .

		So Ber Rabbit he went to de tree an ' poke his head an ' say , '' Come down honey , go up bee . ''

		So de honey com - mence to pour down .

		Dey get so much , but Ber Rabbit it seem like he did n't sati ` fy with what he get .

		So he went to de tree , an ' he get his head into de holler of de tree .

		When he get dere , he said , '' Oh
Ber Wolf	PERSON	, my head is too big .

		You try now . ''

		So Ber
Wolf	PERSON	try .

		Poor feller , he did n't know any better .

		He poke his head way up in de tree .

		After
Ber Wolf	PERSON	get his head in , he say , '' Come down bee , an ' go up honey . ''

		So de honey go up , an ' de bee stung
Ber Wolf	PERSON	to deat ' .

		In connection with the respective literary and folklore elements in the Remus tales a happy valu - ation , it seems to me , is made by
Mark Twain	ORGANIZATION	in a letter to Mr.
Harris	PERSON	in
1881	DATE	: '' You can argue yourself into the delusion that the principle of life is in the stories themselves and not in their setting , but you will save labor by stopping with that soli - tary convert , for he is the only intelligent one you will bag .

		In reality the stories are only alligator pears one eats them merely for the sake of the igig THE DIAL 493 dressing . ''

		To be sure , now and then one hears of somebody who fancies alligator pears without dressing .

		With or without dressing , a diet of alligator pears may lead one to seek variety .

		The seeker , whether artist or folklorist , can find variety in Negro stories as told by Negroes .

		He can find ghost stories , stories of the narrators ' English or Scotch neighbors or forbears ; witch stories that may trace back either to medieval
Europe	LOCATION	or to
Africa	LOCATION	; preacher stories curiously reminiscent of Chaucer or Boccacio ; ''
Ashman	PERSON	'' stories in which swearing Pat is , like Rabbit or
Jack	PERSON	or Pedro Ordi - nales or
Petit Jean	PERSON	, the protagonist of the cycle ; '' fairy stories '' whose European origin is some - times plain and sometimes obscure ; and stories like the tale of the Forty Thieves or the tale of the
Treasury of King Rhampsinitus	ORGANIZATION	, which in the course of wanderings in
Africa	LOCATION	since the days of Herodotus or before have been so transformed that they yield the secret of their origin only to devout study .

		Such study is compounded not only of patience and industry , but of a gratified sense of romance .

		As there is romance in the wanderings of peoples over the globe , so is there romance in the wander - ings of tales .

		It is exciting to recognize in an Apache tale from the
Southwest	ORGANIZATION	or in an Indian tale from
Penobscot Bay	LOCATION	a tale you have heard the day before from a
Cape Verde Islander	LOCATION	on
Cape Cod	LOCATION	, a coincidence which may resolve for you an uncertainty whether the tale came from
Europe	LOCATION	or from
Africa	LOCATION	.

		Or , after comparing the forty-odd variants of a tale collected from
American Negroes	ORGANIZATION	and American Indians from the southeast to the northwest of the continent , it is exciting to hear the one recorded European version of the tale , a Spanish version , fall from the lips of a
Sea Islands Negro	ORGANIZATION	in
South Carolina	LOCATION	.

		The pursuit of folk-tales not only takes one to islands and other places more or less romantic ; it reveals the unlettered people of the world and it leads to intercourse which is unknown , as a rule , to other travelers or sojourners .

		Recently , on a visit to the
Sea Islands	LOCATION	, had I not been sitting by the fire one night in the house of old Mr.
Jack	PERSON	, sometime sailor and , despite the loss of his left arm '' skylarkin ' , '' now boat builder , it is likely that one aspect of the charming little town which is the metropolis of the
Islands	ORGANIZATION	had escaped me .

		We were in the middle of a tale about the Devil Bride - groom when a goodlooking young woman came in from the street and , looking over the screen between the hearth and the open door , said , '' Mr.
Jack	PERSON	, didsh yer hear dat cyar jus ' now in dis street ?

		E ' f I could fin ' out who dat chauffeur , I git after him .

		Six , sewen sojers pile out an ' ax me ef I wan ' mek some money .

		I say , ' Not dat way . '

		Le ' me fin ' out who dat chauffeur , I git after him . ''

		We had heard a motor , but Mr.
Jack	PERSON	was not to be inter - rupted . ''

		I hear ' nothin ' , '' he answered . ''

		I des tellin ' riddles to dish yere ladee . ''

		Later in the island of Defuskie it was as an out - come , I surmise , of the afternoon riddling on the top of an oyster-shell heap that in the evening one of the oyster openers told me of the week-long stay in his house of a '' pa ` tridge '' hunter and his wife from the north , a visit which had caused the Whites of the island to charge the Negro with being pro- German .

		The social intercourse involved had been so contrary to
Southern	LOCATION	ethics that the violator was necessarily pro-German . ''

		But dose white people treated us decent , '' said the host of the Northerners , '' an ' dat was all we cya 'd . ''

		Again , it was due to the friendliness that is a by-product of collecting tales that , after two days and parts of two nights spent in story-telling in the cabin of
James	PERSON	and
Pinkie Middleton	PERSON	of
Hilton Head	ORGANIZATION	, I was informed by my host as he drove me to the shore which is called Spanishville that , had I stayed on in the house of the white man where Mr.
Middleton	PERSON	and I had met r he would not have told me tales '' fo ' no money , not fo ' a week . ''

		Here Mr.
Jack	PERSON	, who had come on with me to this island and was sitting on top of the dress-suit case in the back of the buggy , began to generalize on racial relations . ''

		We hoi ' no communication wid dem , '' he con - cluded .

		And
James Middleton	PERSON	added : `` We pay dem fo ' what we git , an ' dey pay us .

		We do n't boder wid dem an ' dey don ' boder wid us . ''

		Was there ever a more trenchant statement of racial sep - aration ?

		One ` hears quite often from the Whites of the South that the Negroes do not tell stories any more .

		And they do n't to their White neighbors , certainly not to adult Whites , and less and less to the children .

		Story-telling is a pastime which the superior may share with the inferior elders tell stories to children ; a king or judge may point his decision with a tale but , lacking the institution of court jester or minstrel or player , inferiors or quasi - inferiors do not tell stories to their superiors or quasi-superiors , and on the whole the art of story-telling is wont to be practiced between equals .

		Arrogance or condescension stand in the way of story-telling .

		It would be strange indeed if
Southern Negroes	ORGANIZATION	told stories to
Southern Whites	ORGANIZATION	.

		It takes something of an artist to listen to a folk-tale as well as to tell it , and between artists theories of social inequality do not obtrude .

		ELSIE
CLEWS PARSONS	PERSON	.

		494 THE DIAL
May 17	DATE	The Future of American Socialism LE HONEST RADICAL -LRB- who may be defined as the radical who would rather look fact in the face than feast on a phrase -RRB- is discovering today that the chief difference between the exploiter and the exploited is the superiority of the former in initiative , organi - zation , and foresight .

		The rapidity with which capital , faced by revolution and dissolution , has organized its international in the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	, and the readiness with which Republicans and Democrats combine in localities where Socialism has become a menace to all respectable and God-fearing men , may be profitably contrasted with the passion for fragmentation which has animated and dissi - pated the forces of reconstruction in
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	these last half-hundred years .

		The same abounding individuality which makes a man a rebel against Providence and the police makes him also an impatient item in any organized radical group .

		This is an old story , and not the sweetest ever told ; particularly painful today , when the opportunity is so obviously ours to replace deceptive geographical divisions of political opinion by fundamental hori - zontal divisions drawn to accord with the vital and present interests of men .

		Probably the opportunity will be lost , and we poor individualistic Socialists will go on with our infinite division , like a conscien - tous mathematician struggling with the square root of a surd .

		Part of the difficulty , of course , buds out from the fact that radicals deal in new ideas while conserva - tives -LRB- as such -RRB- deal with ideas older than the hills .

		A new idea is an experiment , a risk , an adventure ; it leads a precarious existence always , and has no large expectation of life ; it is more often a fashion than a fact , and even as a fact it may ride insecurely some passing crest of circumstance .

		So we whose radicalism is losing the beardless flush of youth find ourselves caught today in a flux of theory that has long since dislodged us from our cherished isms , and is sweeping us on with a rapidity only less violent than the dizzying current of events .

		Our old fetish of government ownership , for example , is no longer a fit god for our tribe ; our enemies too are begin - ning to worship at this shrine , and we begin to feel ill at ease in its presence .

		We have become sus - picious of the state * and all its works ; we distinguish anxiously now between
Socialism and State Social	ORGANIZATION	- ism though we are rather surer of what we do not , than of what we do , mean by the former term .

		This State Socialism was a religion of weakness ; we wished to be huddled up in the great safe bosom of '' the
Government	ORGANIZATION	, '' to lose our little worried egos in a sort of economic Nirvana in which God and the
State	ORGANIZATION	and ourselves melted into an ethereal , ether - ized unity .

		Then came war ; and overnight the socialized state engulfed us .

		Some of us are relieved , even enthusiastic , over this event ; Mr.
James Mac	PERSON	-
Kaye	PERSON	, indeed , rejoices eloquently , and feels that we are tobogganing into Utopia -LRB- Americanized Social - ism ;
Boni	PERSON	and
Liveright	PERSON	-RRB- .

		But some of us are skeptical , and think of Greek gifts .

		Now , we have had enough of this Schiedemann yellow Socialism ; there is more for our eyes and our hopes in the brilliant colors with which
Bolshe	PERSON	- vism is covering the canvas of the world .

		Soviet is the throned word of the day ; we shall send our Congressmen back to school , and shall put in their place a body of deputies chosen by the producers , rather than named and '' put through '' by the in - vestors of the country .

		Clearly we Americans are in matters political still at the imitative stage ; we import our isms bodily from
Germany	LOCATION	-LRB- State Socialism -RRB- , or from
France	LOCATION	-LRB- Syndicalism -RRB- , or from
England	LOCATION	-LRB- Labor Party programs -RRB- , or from
Russia	LOCATION	-LRB- Bolshevism -RRB- ; and any suggestion that these the - ories must be changed to fit the peculiar perspective of the American scene passes over our heads , close to the clouds though they be .

		Mr.
Louis Fraina	PERSON	, for example -LRB- Revolutionary Socialism ; Communist Press -RRB- wants a red-hot revolution immediately , if not sooner , and never doubts that the proletariat of these
United States	LOCATION	is prepared to take over all the means of production and distribution , and to man - age sufficiently well the complicated interrelations of American agriculture , industry , and commerce .

		The differences in size , organization , and intelligence be - tween the business class in
America	LOCATION	and the business class in
Russia	LOCATION	; the condition , character , and con - servatism of the average American farmer ; the pres - ence of a large and victorious army ; the individual - istic and careerist tradition that has molded us all , immigrant almost as much as native , radical almost as much as conservative ; the comparative -LRB- though rapidly decreasing -RRB- fluidity of classes in
America	LOCATION	; the secret hope in almost every wage-slave 's heart that he will some day be a happy exploiter himself , with a front pew at church and an ancient coat of arms on his stationery ; the vast horde of servants '' parasitic proletariat , ''
Shaw	PERSON	has called them whose interests are so bound up with the present regime that they are more reactionary than their masters ; the blurring of the distinction between producer and investor as a result of stock-holding , profit-sharing , bond-purchases , and so on ; the bour -
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 495 geois affiliation of practically all men trained for directive and administrative functions ; above all the conservatism of the dominant group in the ranks of organized labor in
America	LOCATION	treacherous details of this sort are to our gentle revolutionaries but spots on the rising sun ; let us put our blinders on and move forward ; '' if we reflect too much we shall never act at all '' ; let us have action , action , action , and we can ask questions afterward .

		No , we must take leave of Mr.
Fraina	PERSON	too ; mere - ly recommending his book as a very capable and sin - cere exposition of the revolutionary point of view .

		And now , having successfully demolished all other theories , nothing remains for us to do but to formu - late and establish our own nostrum .

		There are three questions involved : First , what do we want ?

		-LRB- Most of us stop here . -RRB-

		Second , what can we get ?

		-LRB- Most others stop here . -RRB-

		Third , just how are we going to go about it ?

		-LRB- Some get thus far . -RRB-

		Most radicalism is rather an aspiration than a resolution ; and most of the resolution fights shy of specific pur - poses , methods , and details .

		Two things we can perhaps agree on as items in our general social desire : One , that '' labor '' shall have at least an equal share with '' capital '' in the direction of indus - try , local and national and not merely in the dis - cussion and arbitration of lesser industrial disputes , as seems to be upshot of the
Whitley	PERSON	Reports until such time as all capital may be socialized and the private investor squeezed out of existence .

		Two , that to our present
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, retained as a geograph - ically elected body representing us as consumers , we shall add a national economic congress of deputies elected by agricultural and industrial groups and representing us as producers .

		The first of these two commandments of the new dispensation is probably as much as can be made effective at present .

		A revolution might realize both , or more , for a time ; but the lack of administrative and commercial train - ing among the members of the proletariat would pre - sumably result in a swing back to the condition as here outlined and here proposed as within the bounds of bloodless attainment .

		Towards this prosaic attainment we would sug - gest , first of all , that some effort be made to bring into general harmony at least on these two points the four fundamental forces making for a better social order in
America	LOCATION	: a unified Labor party , a broadened Socialist party , a more partisan Non - Partisan League , and the more advanced element in the very varied ranks of American liberalism .

		The Labor party would have to open its ranks to all who live by their labor of hand or brain ; the Socialists would have to stretch a point or two in their con - stitution and develop a more flexible machinery ; the rebellious farmers would have to play a bolder game than heretofore , sacrificing some immediate gains to larger ulterior purposes ; and the liberals well , can anything good still be said for the liberals ?

		The very word is in bad odor with all men who can detect decomposition ; it has come to betoken a mild and bespectacled indecision , as of a man who dis - penses radical rhetoric but can not forget that he has some shares in
Bethlehem Steel	LOCATION	.

		Yet the threat - ening propinquity of revolution is sifting the ranks of the liberals , driving into a frankly conservative posi - tion those who think that pills will do where surgery is needed ; and the remnant finds its hands freer to work for some such program as has been here put forth .

		Let then these four elements unite Laborite , Socialist ,
Leaguer	LOCATION	, and Liberal and they may quicken a new birth which will burst the shell that is stifling American growth .

		But all this is politics , and is mere paper and ink unless behind it stand forceful organizations of pro- ducers and consumers .

		That consumers too must be organized is elementary , and hardly calls for demonstration here .

		That our trade-unions must turn over a new leaf , passing from the isolated con - sideration of hours and wages to self-preparation for all the tasks of industrial management and co-ordi - nation , is a proposition that can better bear repeat - ing ; we offer it here as the second constituent in our general panacea .

		The new society must be built from the bottom up , with the remodeled labor union as its productive and directive unit .

		But it must be a maturer union than that which gives Mr.
Gompers	PERSON	carte blanche to stultify American labor in the con - ferences of
Europe	LOCATION	; it must become worthy of its future .

		It will have to reorganize on an industrial rather than a craft basis , with shop-committees re - placing the old union machine ; it will have to broaden its borders to include all producers , manual or mental , who care to be included .

		So labor will -LRB- let us pray -RRB- eventually unite itself as thoroughly as capital is united ; '' one big union '' is indispens - able to ultimate labor control of production and dis - tribution , and will serve as effective counterpoint to the centralized control of capital .

		And in every city these organizations of labor will join hands for all manner of purposes , economic , political , recrea - tive and educational .

		To this last , in the end , all plans return .

		Each great center of population must have its labor-financed
People 's University	ORGANIZATION	, where all may freely learn who can show a producer 's card , and where men effectively pledged to labor-loyalty may be selected and trained to fill , one by one , the places of direction and management in industry and commerce .

		And out of each such university may come a daily paper accurate and thorough in its reports , courageous and constructive in its com - ments , managed and edited by a board that will rep - 49 6 THE DIAL
May 17	DATE	resent fairly the varied elements that are joined in its support .

		To teach workingmen to read their own press , and to produce a labor press which work - ingmen can be persuaded to read this is part of the prelude to reconstruction .

		In short , we are not worthy of a revolution be - cause we have not yet developed a system with which to replace the order that we would depose .

		It is only by the artificial stimulus of European example and '' democratic '' autocracy at home that we are driven to think of it ; the indispensable basis of a successful revolution the ability to replace and improve upon the existing system is not yet pres - ent ; certainly less so here than in
England	LOCATION	.

		To advocate revolution without serious conviction of our ability to make this substitution is to invite workingmen to be slaughtered for an ideologist 's holiday .

		We can not write our poetic drama yet ; we can only write the prologue , and in prose .

		We can only make straight the way .

		We can organize our forces , add to our resources , and develop within our ranks men fit to deal with the complexities , , of our economic interrelations , domestic and foreign ; we can use our present power to compel the democ - ratization of industry by the equal representation of labor with capital on all industrial boards ; and with this leverage we can one by one replace the mana - gers , engineers , agents , and merchants whose hearts are loyal to the past , with men chosen by the forces of labor , trained in the universities of labor , pledged to the purposes of labor , and directed by its councils .

		And so , perhaps , unheroically but surely , the new day will dawn .

		, , , , - , 3 WILL DURANT .

		The Impending Industrial Crisis HREE GROUPS of events , quite distinct to many whom they intimately concern , hold the key to the riddle of demobilization .

		The first is the decrease in the volume of production and of business and a consequent increase in the number of the unem - ployed .

		The second is the rapid growth in the num - ber of strikes since the first of the year , a tendency which bears evidence to the alarming amount of in - dustrial unrest in the country .

		The third is a series of steps which make up the unscientific and dilatory policy of the '' Government '' in dealing with the sit - nation .

		This last is typified by two significant occurrences .

		On
May I , 1919	DATE	, there went into effect a new schedule of high taxes upon '' luxuries . ''

		These im - positions upon cosmetics , high-priced clothing , and like articles had the sanction of the financial experts of the
Bureau of International Revenue	ORGANIZATION	and the all but unanimous approval of the economists of the country .

		But they were originally designed , not to raise revenue but to force producers to turn their at - tention from non-essential to essential commodities .

		Because of a needless delay of nine months by Con - gress they are useless for stimulating the production of munitions of war .

		Because a tax bill designed by experts for a war emergency was not revised in the light of the conditions of an impending peace , these taxes serve to discourage production , retard the con - version of industry to a peace basis , and to contribute to swelling the volume of the unemployed .

		A few days earlier a representative of the army stated that demobilization had nearly reached the two million mark and that the process was going for - ward with alacrity .

		His statement was satisfactory to himself and doubtless to other devotees of ritual .

		Nor was it vain self-congratulation , for he had the testimony of clean desks and accurate files to effici - ency in his work .

		It may be that non-consultation by laymen in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	with financial experts , and con - gratulatory smiles by army officers are poor ultimates in a philosophical quest .

		Yet in the act of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	in putting good advice to a bad use and in the satis - faction of the army chiefs over their work the prin - cipal causes of the muddle of demobilization are to be found .

		Unlike the larger issue of reconstruction , the problem of demobilization was too immediate to escape even Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's Benthamite logic .

		The government had conscripted men ; it had to devise some plan of getting rid of them .

		The government had contracted for supplies ; it had to formulate some scheme for the cancellation of contracts .

		Of - ficials charged with the discharge of men and the riddance of contracts may be able to view their acts apart from -LCB- heir effect upon the industrial sys - tem , and in emulation of the deity see the work which they have done and find it good .

		But one who recognizes the problem as part of the larger one of reorganizing industry by transferring men and materials from emergency to ordinary uses is likely to behold the result and call it a failure .

		To understand the nature and extent of the failure of the administration 's demobilization policy , or lack of one , it is necessary to have the story .

		And the story begins in
November	DATE	.

		One reason for the lack of success is that it did not begin months earlier .

		In
November	DATE	arose the question of whether de -
1919	DATE	497 mobilization was likely to involve an industrial crisis or whether it could safely be left to the min - istrations of the general staff and '' the simple and obvious system of natural liberty . ''

		The optimists , whose numbers at that time were overwhelming , saw just ahead of us farm , mine , and factory filled with well-paid and contented laborers producing wealth enough to insure national plenty and to take away the dearth of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Their vision was of '' peace on earth and good will to men '' made doubly sure by abundance .

		The pessimists , a mere handful at the signing of the
Armistice	ORGANIZATION	, had as little trouble in discerning in the near future an industrial system half-stalled , a host of laborers half-employed or idle , wages falling and labor standards going to rack , and anarchy arising to devastate the land .

		Their vision was the specter of hatred , class strug - gle , and violence , kept alive by unemployment , dis - content , and hunger .

		To understand the matter aright let us look at it as each of these groups did at the time of the
Armistice	ORGANIZATION	.

		The optimists found all signs pointing to fair weather .

		The plant capacity of the country , consisting of field , mine , factory , railway , and shop , had been increased by the war , and was ample for all needs .

		The great demand for goods gave em - ployers an incentive to maintain production at a high level .

		Evidence of this demand was to be found in the anticipated purchase of non-essentials which had been renounced for the war , in depleted stocks of goods which merchants had to replace , in wear and tear and '' deferred maintenance , '' in the construction of buildings and the production of equipment halted by the war , and in the large orders which would come to us for the wherewithal to rebuild a devastated
Europe	LOCATION	.

		A visible record of this demand was to be found in accumulated orders which crowded the files of every productive firm .

		With such a stimulus to industry the indica - tion was rather of a shortage than a surplus of labor .

		Before the war the industries of the country had been able to absorb neatly a million new immigrants a year .

		Since the autumn of
1914	DATE	only a fraction of this number had come in .

		Even if plants had to be converted to peace uses , the matter was not serious .

		Peace had come before the process of mak - ing industry serve the needs of war was completed , and the structure of the industrial system remained intact .

		That all the laborers could be put back into the system was evidenced by the fact that they had been withdrawn .

		And finally , history was called upon to countersign the promises of prophecy .

		The Civil War had been followed by an era of prosperity .

		Then why not this one ?

		Thus the optimists persuaded those who agreed with them that peace meant plenty , prosperity , and peace .

		But real pessimists do not easily forego the joys of seeing the future as through a glass darkly .

		They refused to be silenced by even so rosy an array of argument .

		They denied these and affirmed propositions of their own fashioning .

		Many plants , hastily erected , were useless for peace-time produc - tion ; many more could be made of service only through great expense and after long delay .

		But , even if plants and equipment were adequate , there was no assurance that they would all be used .

		Owners would run their establishments only if they saw a profit in doing so .

		This profit was an affair of demand and of price .

		Undoubtedly there was a great need for goods of all sorts .

		But need did not constitute effective demand , the kind which stirs business into activity .

		To be effective need must be attended by the means wherewith to pay and a willingness to purchase at high prices .

		Manu - facturer and merchant alike would hesitate to buy raw materials and stocks when prices were on the eve of a decline .


Europe	LOCATION	was by no means a good prospective debtor .

		Even if it could afford our goods it would be reluctant to pay our prices .

		Ac - cumulated orders were no infallible index of the future , for there was no assurance that all of them were `` live . ''

		If anticipated profits failed to per - suade the owner to produce , employment would not be forthcoming .

		Men would seek without finding , and those who found might not cheerfully accept the lower wages which were offered .

		The result would ^ be underemployment or none at all , low wages or their lack , a breaking down of labor stand - ards by a desperate competition of the great unem - ployed for a little work , a disruption of the buying power of the masses , a further threat to the em - ployer 's inducement to go ahead , and the prospect of group conflict and industrial depression .

		The temper of employer and employee alike held the seeds of trouble .

		Their union had but the simple end of winning the war .

		Self-interest , held in leash , might be expected to display itself in sus - picion and prevent the cooperation which alone would save the situation .

		The forces of war had been loosed , and naught that man could do would stay the consequences .

		The Civil War analogy was worthless .

		Men drawn from farms for a local struggle could be reabsorbed ' .

		As for the reabsorp - tion of men drawn from an intricate industrial sys - tem for a world-wide conflict , that was , another matter .

		Thus the pessimists assured each other that peace meant dearth , calamity , and warfare .

		Between these two stood a third group little prone to positive prediction , and fond of the words , '' if '' '' then . ''

		They saw in a plastic situation the elements alike of promise and of despair .

		With the optimists they agreed that in plant and equip -
49 8	DATE	THE DIAL
May 17	DATE	ment , in natural resources , in labor , we were pos - sessed of the materials of prosperity .

		With the pessimists they were in harmony in seeing in the situation elements of danger .

		They differed from both in insisting that the future could be shaped by means of a conscious policy .

		To them attitudes were the result of markets or the lack of them , of employment or its absence , and markets and em - ployment depended upon the speed and efficiency with which industry was reorganized .

		This group included many men scattered throughout the coun - try and had its representatives even among the per - sonnel of the war boards at
Washington	LOCATION	.

		In all probability a unified and consistent pro- gram for the demobilization period has never found written expression .

		- But its various parts , which fit together into a fairly consistent plan of action , are all recorded in '' memoranda '' with which those upon '' the working level '' bombarded departmental chiefs , heads of boards , and others upon '' the dis - cretionary level '' who together form that inchoate personnel known outside of
Washington	LOCATION	as '' the government . ''

		This paper assault engaged repre - sentatives of most of the departments and boards at the Capitol .

		It lasted from early
October	DATE	until mid-November .

		The general principles which found expression in these documents were three in number : first , the demobilization of men and ma - terials must respond to the industrial needs of the country ; second , by conscious policy the government must hasten the return of industry to a peace basis ; third , the government must provide employment for the men who are certain to be left adrift in the process .

		Together these policies analyze the prob - lem of demobilization and reveal the factors which , left uncontrolled , have made the situation what it is today .

		For this reason each of them requires explicit statement .

		In the first place , demobilization must respond to the industrial needs of the country .

		If the use to which men and materials were to be put made of mobilization a military matter , then demobiliza - tion is stamped with an industrial label .

		The army 's needs expire suddenly and the men can be quickly released .

		But the adjustment of industry to new conditions takes time .

		Hence the need is for an arrested demobilization .

		Both the rate at which and the order in which men and plants are to be transferred from emergency to ordinary uses must be carefully determined .

		As for industrial establishments , they should be released from war work as fast , and no faster than , they can find civilian work to do .

		This can be effected through a carefully formulated policy for the cancellation of war contracts .

		Through this policy contracts which involve articles useless in time of peace must go first , those involving goods which can later find a way into ordinary commerce last .

		In addition the can - cellation of contracts should be governed by the po - sitions which the goods affected hold in the produc - tive sequence which runs from raw materials to finished products .

		In like manner a definite policy must guide the discharge of men .

		It must not take account of sol - diers alone ; it must comprehend all who are bring - ing their labor to market .

		Since soldiers compete with discharged munitions workers and other civil - ians , assurance of employment is contingent upon arresting the whole flow into the labor market .

		This threatening flood is composed of five streams : i -RRB- discharged workers from war industries , 2 -RRB- men in service overseas , 3 -RRB- men in arms in this country , 4 -RRB- immigrants , and 5 -RRB- young persons bringing their labor to market for the first time .

		Each of these streams is subject to more or less control .

		Through them the flow into the labor market can be arrested .

		In this way the chances of soldiers finding acceptable work may be multi - plied many fold .

		The control of the government over these groups varies .

		The most immediate danger lies in the wholesale discharge of munitions workers .

		They threaten tq .

		deluge the market , to snap up the better places , to force wages down , and to cause discharged soldiers to seek work in a glutted market .

		Their discharge can be controlled only through the indi - rect means of reading the intent to hold them back into a policy for the cancellation of contracts .

		The men under arms , both overseas and in this country , are under a single authority .

		Their discharge may be hastened or stayed as the powers that be decree .

		Whatever considerations impel a speedy release , it is possible to prevent them from flooding the market .

		Neither of the two groups last named offers a serious threat .

		For the time at least the scarcity of shipping is an effective bar to immigration .

		Most of the young people who might now be seeking work for the first time have already been drawn into industry .

		Thus , of the streams into the labor market , one is subject to indirect control , two of them are responsive to exact direction , and two of them are for the time closed .

		The control of the discharge of labor requires also a scheme of priorities .

		Labor is not a fluid fund of units which can be used interchangeably at will .

		Attention must always be given to the requirements of the place and the capacities of the man .

		Military must yield to industrial usefulness , and no chance of putting a laborer into an accept - able place should be overlooked .

		Requests from employers should in all reasonable cases be acceded to .

		In priorities managers of business should be
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 499 released early , for their planning is necessary to a resumption of industry which eventually will create employment for others .

		By tempering policies such as these to changing circumstances the flow of labor could in detail be adjusted to the country 's need for men .

		In the second place the government should strive to hasten the return of industry to a peace footing .

		Its aim should be to draw within the effective or - ganization of industry as much of the productive equipment of the country as possible .

		Manifestly no panacea will suffice for so large and delicate a task .

		But there is much which a wise government might do .

		By regulating cancellation of contracts it could prevent plants from standing idle .

		Through priorities in the discharge of men it could influence the order in which industry was resumed , and thus hasten the process .

		By placing new orders judi - ciously it could stimulate resumption when and where it was lagging .

		If labor were lacking , a con - cern could be supplied from the stores of the army .

		If a scarcity of raw materials were the limiting factor , a priorities board could see that they were available .

		If capital were lacking for conversion or another purpose , a peace finance corporation should prove of service .

		Even something could be done to stimulate demand .

		If many industries are idle , their employees are not paid , and no one fares well who has goods to sell .

		If all resume production , and too many do not turn out the same article , the owners and employees of each should constitute a market for the products of the ` others .

		With prospect of little loss the government could guarantee industries a reasonable profit for the demobilization period .

		It could thus secure addi - tional wealth from establishments the timidity of whose owners would otherwise bind them to partial idleness .

		By a careful supervision of production it could remove the dangers of over - production of certain lines of goods .

		Finally its policy would arrest the hesitation which comes from an expectation of falling prices .

		By removing this threat upon profits it would stimulate production .

		Even if resumption could not be brought entirely under control , the hand of the government , cun - ningly applied , promised better than the ruthless struggle under laissez-faire .

		In the third place the government should miti - gate the unemployment which at best would attend the process .

		The men who find themselves victims of the rapid changes in industry should be given something to do until they can find regular employ - ment .

		Perhaps the best device for furnishing '' buffer employment '' is a provision of public works by federal , state , and municipal governments .

		It is no secret of state that the multiform per - sonality called the government undertook no policy so comprehensive and so definite as this one .

		Those who get their notions of its activities from text - books may not understa id its hesitation .

		But those who are acquainted with the genus in its native habitat will not have to be told the reasons for its timidity .

		Here they must be set down in briefest fashion .

		There was little interest in demobiliza - tion and even less consciousness of what it involved .

		So far as those who decide things considered the matter , they saw only boundless resources and the unprecedented demand for goo3s .

		They argued that all was well ahead and were content to let Mr.
Baker	PERSON	's department handle the matter .

		The Secre - tary of War , who knows perhaps better than any one else the limitations of the military mind , and is perhaps the world 's greatest authority upon its incapacity for industrial and social problems , let the matter go .

		As a result the general staff ex - hibited its customary reticence at the prospect of the ceremonial of discharge by military units being disturbed by so small a matter as concern over jobs for the victims .

		As for the civilians they took refuge in the magic of making all well by insisting that all was well , and joined the Whistlers ' Chorus .

		So it came about that matters were left to the War Department , '' the simple and obvious system of natural liberty , '' and to '' the invisible hand . ''

		Little attempt was to be made to slow up de - mobilization or to correlate its streams ; the re - sumption of industry Was to be intrusted to whom it might concern , and no buffer was to be erected against impending dangers .

		Under certain condi - tions men were to be released upon representa - tions from employers .

		A faint-hearted effort was to be made to give system to the cancellation of con - tracts .

		Some motions were to be made to solve the problem in terms of the recipe of the Civil War and settle soldiers from cities upon an agricul - tural frontier which does not exist .

		A pious wish was expressed that something might be done to pro- vide '' buffer employment '' upon public works .

		And that was all .

		The gods often aid those who blindly trust them .

		Thus far they have threatened but they have sent upon us no industrial calamity .

		Many factors lurking in strange places have kept the gravest dangers from our doors .

		A belief that all was well for a time prevented serious trouble .

		The more compact or - ganization of industries brought by the war has given them an ability better to withstand an impact .

		Limited shipping facilities have slowed up the rate of the return of overseas men .

		And a reasonable measure of inefficiency has worked magic in stay - ing demobilization .

		Delay in getting blanks , fussi - ness about forms , and much ado over proper pro- 500 THE DIAL
May 17	DATE	cedure have been of more service than they will ever get credit for .

		Even official procrastination has improved the quality of judgment in defiance of copy-book mottoes .

		But most important of all , the hue and cry against non-essentials never drove '' business as usual '' out of the land .

		Our conse - cration of industry to the service of war was never as complete as it seemed .

		Therefore we have pre - served intact what every European country has lost , the structure of the pre-war organization of in - dustry .

		But the end is not y ; t. For some weeks the gods have muttered at the load , and occasionally they have thundered .

		The reports of the labor situation gathered by the employment service speak of im - pending trouble .

		For
November	DATE	they were rosy ;
December	DATE	saw them promising ;
January	DATE	found them colorless ; in
February	DATE	they threatened ; and
March	DATE	found them gravely alarming .

		Although they are fragmentary and come from optimistic sources , at the end of
March	DATE	they showed nearly four hun - dred thousand unemployed .

		Since the first of
April	DATE	we have been denied also their help .

		The failure of an appropriation impaired the efficiency of the ser - vice , reports became more fragmentary and came in from little more than one half the number of cities , and the consequent tallerations became well-nigh meaningless .

		Just when we most need a picture of the whole situation , it is not to be had .

		Unrest is visible here and there ; in more than one city soldiers have already paraded their status of being among the unemployed .

		In many localities unrest is finding ex - pression in strikes .

		It is true that these strikes have little existence in the newspapers ; but even those journals which conscientiously limit themselves to '' the news that 's fit to print '' have had to note the more important of these .

		A certain barometer of the change is to be found in the attitude of officials .

		The indifference of
November	DATE	had become a grave concern by
March	DATE	.

		The governors who came to - gether at the request of the President to consider unemployment are the very ones who manifested no interest in the problem when it was brought to their reluctant attention at their conference at
Annapolis	LOCATION	in
December	DATE	.

		A bill providing for a federal commission upon public works was being pushed strongly in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	when it adjourned .

		An act prohibiting immigration for a period of years is likely to-pass
Congress	ORGANIZATION	when it reconvenes , and may run the gauntlet of a presidential veto .

		Even the army has become concerned and a would - be discharged soldier may abide in the ranks until he has assurance of employment .

		The
Chamber of Commerce	ORGANIZATION	of the
United States	LOCATION	has demanded a call - ing of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	immediately upon the President 's return from abroad .

		The impending crisis is not yet over .

		The trade papers are full of gloomy predictions about the fu - ture .

		`` The industrial depression of
1919	DATE	'' is already upon us .

		In the face of this the country is not yet ready to take vigorous action .

		The mail and wires bring to members of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	floods of telegrams asking for a provision for '' buffer em - ployment . ''

		But they carry fully as many messages protesting against the high rates of taxation .

		The government still persists in attempting to deal with the situation through the processes of magic .

		The Secretary of Labor has recently taken the lead in insisting that an intricate problem in industrial or - ganization can be solved by wishing and that the dan - gers in the situation will disappear before an act of collective volition .

		He has assumed to lead several members of the Cabinet and other high dignitaries in an anthem which has become characteristically the
Administration	ORGANIZATION	's own '' The
Whistler	LOCATION	's Chorus . ''

		But fortunately the problem lies in the immediate transition to peace , not in the ultimate matter of national well-being .

		Upon that we shall doubtless be saved , as we have been many times of yore , by our vast stores of natural resources , ... our help in ages past , Our hope for years to come , A refuge from the stormy blast , And our eternal home .

1919	DATE
THE DIAL Japan	ORGANIZATION	and
America	LOCATION	.

		R. CREEL 'S CRITICS should have been sent to a foreign country to view his activities in a new per - spective .

		When the armistice was signed the
Bureau of Public Information	ORGANIZATION	was at its height .

		Every newspaper in
Japan	LOCATION	was daily printing about two columns of American news conceived from an Amer - ican standpoint .

		And daily newspapers in
Japan	LOCATION	are many and widely circulated .

		Small towns that in the
United States	LOCATION	would depend upon journals of the large cities have sheets of some importance .

		Prac - tically every Japanese man reads a newspaper .

		To put it moderately , the international value of publicity is not less in
Japan	LOCATION	than in other countries .

		Self - consciousness about foreign affairs and about what other nations think of one 's own country is perhaps more intense there than anywhere else .

		No country is so responsive to the approbation of other peoples , and none more sensitive to slights , real or fancied .

		It was then hardly a coincidence that pro-Ameri - canism in
Japan	LOCATION	rose with the rising of news from
America	LOCATION	, and was at its height when the end of war came .

		There was enthusiasm for
America	LOCATION	's energetic share in bringing peace , and even more for her aims .

		Sentiment was warmer toward us than any time since the end of the Russo-Japanese war and the days when readers of a
Tokyo	LOCATION	newspaper voted
George Washington	PERSON	and
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	to head the list of the world 's great men when that paper took a poll .

		Such a vote , placing Americans above even the Japanese national heroes , is a surprise to those of our countrymen who regard the Japanese as devoted to a narrow and exclusive '' patriotism . ''

		But the indication it gives of the almost sentimental responsiveness of the Japanese is more to .

		be depended upon than current opinions that make the Japanese people completely self-centered .

		On the spot one reaches the conclusion that some at least of the most chauvinistic utterances of her politicians are in - tended as a makeweight against too ready popular enthusiasms for outside countries .

		Today the
Bureau of Public Information	ORGANIZATION	is out of existence , and Japanese newspapers are largely en - gaged in an anti-American drive which however already shows some signs of waning , as influential statesmen have issued warnings against it .

		It is no coincidence that this drive began when news from the
United States	LOCATION	had been for some weeks at its low - est ebb .

		The Pacific cable has been broken , and no news has come directly , and none even indirectly from the
Associated Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		Hence all knowledge of both
America	LOCATION	and of the
Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	has reached the public through three non-American sources : British , French , and Japanese .

		The latter two are , so it is currently believed , subsidized .

		The French Havas service if not anti-American has been steadily anti-Wilson .

		The Japanese service , both the regular
Kokusai	ORGANIZATION	and the special cables , has been chiefly concerned with the questions of race discrimi - nation and
China	LOCATION	.

		The Reuter service is not anti- American but is decidedly pro-British , and with American ' prestige at the height it has reached all over the
Far East	LOCATION	, there is no motive , economic or political , for expressly cultivating its further growth .

		As a net result the reader of the press would re - ceive the impression that President
Wilson	PERSON	's policies have had a very bad back-set , even if they were not positively discredited ; that he has practically failed both at home and abroad in securing an effective following ; and that the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	will either fail in the end or be adopted in such a form as to represent a complete defeat for
Wilson	PERSON	.

		Prior re - gard for the
United States	LOCATION	was largely due to sym - pathy with the idealism of
Wilson	PERSON	's policies and the wave of liberal sentiment they released .

		But if they are coming to nothing , the wave naturally subsides .

		There are also many items which leave the further impression that '' humanity '' and peace for the whole world were merely disguises behind which material - istic
America	LOCATION	was hiding her commercial and terri - torial ambitions in
China	LOCATION	,
Siberia	LOCATION	, and other parts of the world .

		The
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	has been held up as a scheme of Anglo-American capitalism to dominate the world without the trouble .

		and expense of maintaining an army .

		As a reputable publicist recently said , '' when the robber is expelled , the swindler is likely to enter '' ; the menace of German militarism is destroyed to give way to that of
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	- American economic domination .

		Those whose faith in moral factors as political forces has departed should pay a visit to the
Far East	LOCATION	.

		Unless they have become complete cynics their faith will revive .

		Sentiment will appear as a thing of almost incalculable importance .

		On the one hand , Oriental diplomacy is an object lesson in the suicidal character of an international politics based on narrow considerations of self-interest .

		There are no critics of
Japan	LOCATION	's policies more severe than many of the Japanese , who declare that for lack of suffi - cient disinterestedness
Japan	LOCATION	has thrown away in
Asia	LOCATION	one of the greatest opportunities that ever came to any nation .

		While the present
Kara	PERSON	ministry has tried to repair the evils done by the prior
Terauchi	PERSON	ministry , these critics feel that the mischief has been 502 THE DIAL
May 17	DATE	done and done because of a short-sighted policy of seeking immediate and one-sided advantage .

		On the other hand , it is evident that American prestige and influence rise and fall in the Far East with belief and disbelief in the generosity and idealism of her purposes .

		The Americans at home who have adver - tised opposition to the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	have as - sumed a heavy responsibility .

		They have made many intelligent foreigners , previously sympathetic with
America	LOCATION	, open to the impression , fostered by inadequate news service , that
Wilson	PERSON	's professed aims were a cloak .

		They have done
America	LOCATION	an ill turn in spreading the conviction that in truth Amer - ica cares at home only for her supremacy in
South America	LOCATION	and abroad only for such power as will increase trade .

		It is not my intention to repeat the items of the newspaper criticism of the
United States	LOCATION	that would stimulate a like criticism of
Japan	LOCATION	.

		They are re - ferred to for an opposite purpose , to bring out the various factors which at the present time are affect - ing the formation of public opinion .

		In part , most
Tokyo	LOCATION	newspapers are against the ministry whatever it is .

		Criticism of the
United States	ORGANIZATION	is thus an easy way of hitting the
Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is accused on one side of truckling to the
United States	LOCATION	and on the other of failure to promote Japanese interests prop - erly at the
Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	, in
Siberia	LOCATION	, and in
China	LOCATION	.

		There is also a natural reaction in the face of the surprising exhibition of patriotism and power , military as well as economic , manifest by the
United States	LOCATION	.

		There is a revulsion of combined suspicion and dread not unlike that which in the
United States	LOCATION	followed after
Japan	LOCATION	's victory over
Russia	LOCATION	.

		The result was desired but it seemed unnecessarily demonstrative .

		Hence events in
Korea	LOCATION	, in
Siberia	LOCATION	, in
China	LOCATION	, where it is possible for imagination to in -
volve America	LOCATION	either officially or through private individuals , take on an ominous aspect .

		The race discrimination issue , which becomes pointed in the virtual prohibition of immigraton , suddenly takes on a renewed importance .

		The reported abolition of conscription seems to be aimed particularly at
Japan	LOCATION	.

		Each one of these matters is too complicated to be discussed merely in passing .

		It is enough to say here that they constitute the headings of the chief charges brought against the
United States	LOCATION	, adding that the accusations as respects
China	LOCATION	and
Siberia	LOCATION	have many sub-headings .

		Looked at from this point of view , the drive against
America	LOCATION	ceases to be a mere matter of newspaper recrimination and retort , and becomes a kind of burning glass in which focus all the possible causes of friction between the two countries .

		Up to the present the anti-Americanism is , ac - cording to the best reports I can get , almost wholly confined to the newspapers .

		The difference of tone within and without the newspapers is such as to create a feeling that somewhere it is thought that the people are too pro-American , and need to have their sympathies and affections cooled .

		Especially does it seem suspicious that the only chord which wins a spontaneous popular response should be increas - ingly harped upon the race-discrimination issue .

		However this may be , there is one fact that
Ameri	PERSON	- cans should bear unceasingly in mind when accounts reach them of anti-American propaganda in
Japan	LOCATION	.

		The outstanding fact is that the outcome of the vtar has dealt the militaristic and bureaucratic party in
Japan	LOCATION	the greatest blow it has ever had .

		It is not too much to say that only one thing could have shaken its hold to a greater extent , and that is the actual defeat in war of the party itself .

		If this element of Japanese life , so strong in the past , is not to pass into deeper eclipse and be permanently discredited to such an extent that nothing less than a radical realign - ment of Japanese politics will occur , it must take steps to recover some of ita lost prestige .

		The easiest way to accomplish this recovery is to foster that dread and suspicion of other nations which is the ultimate source of all militarism , since it is the only thing that will make a nation endure the burdens militarism im - poses .

		There are some symptoms that the discredited party has wavered between
Great Britain	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	in selecting the danger which only its own reinvestment can avert .

		But aside from the alliance with
Great Britain	LOCATION	which still holds , the
United States	LOCATION	is uppermost in everybody 's mind at the present .

		It was from
America	LOCATION	that proceeded the cry which made the war one between autocracy and democracy , and the difficulties which
Japan	LOCATION	is experiencing in
Korea	LOCATION	,
Siberia	LOCATION	, and
China	LOCATION	can most plausibly be attributed to
America	LOCATION	.

		I asked an intelligent and well-informed Japanese friend if he did not think that this situation , to - gether with the absence of authentic American news , explained the present outburst of criticism .

		He was very sure that it did not .

		And his reason is so sig - nificant that I give it .

		It is not possible , he said , that the bureaucrats and militarists should be back of the criticisms , for they have so completely lost their authority and influence that they are powerless .

		I quote the answer because it illustrates that loss of standing and prestige to which reference has been made a loss so extreme that at first it seemed in - credible , but which I am now convinced is the out - standing fact in the present life of
Japan	LOCATION	.

		That , however , a party still entrenched in education , the army , and the civil service should be so completely discredited as to surrender without a struggle does not seem probable .

		1919 THE DIAL The moral of all this for our own country is almost too obvious to need mentioning .

		The cause of liberalism in
Japan	LOCATION	has taken a mighty forward leap so mighty as to be almost unbelievable .

		The causes which produced it can sustain it .

		If they do sustain it , there will be little backward reaction .

		If they do not continue in force to sustain it , they will betray it .

		To speak more plainly , the release of lib - eral forces that had been slowly forming beneath the lid was due to the belief that democracy really stood for the supremacy of fairness , humanity , and good feeling , and that consequently in a democratic world a nation like
Japan	LOCATION	, ambitious but weak in many respects in which her competitors are strong , could afford to enter upon the paths of liberalism .

		The real test has not yet come .

		But if the nominally democratic world should go back on the professions so profusely uttered during war days , the shock will be enormous , and bureaucracy and militarism might come back .

		One can not believe that such a thing is to happen .

		But every manifestation of national greed , every cynical attack upon the basic ideas of the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	, every repudiation of inter - national idealism , every thoughtless word of race prejudice , every exhibition of dislike and unjustified suspicion directed at
Japan	LOCATION	is .

		gratuitous offering in support of the now waning cause of autocratic bureaucracy in
Japan	LOCATION	.

		Liberalism here has plenty of difficulties still to overcome .

		Only the liberals in
Japan	LOCATION	itself , who have now taken heart and cour - age , can work out the problem .

		But liberals else - where can at least fight against those untoward developments in their own countries which will restore to the Japanese reactionaries the weapons which the outcome of the war has loosed from their hands .

		JOHN DEWEY .

		Ireland Between Two Stools 3 HILE MANY SMALL nations , from neutral
Danes	LOCATION	to most belligerent Czecho-Slovaks , have seen in the collapse of German militarism the hope of national resurgence and security ,
Ireland	LOCATION	has not been allowed to seize more than the most insubstan - tial promise of some degree of autonomy .

		We have been permitted to cling , with the fervor of despera - tion , to the possibility of American intervention on our behalf .

		This hopeful gleam has been per - ceptible , it is true , only to the most ostensibly un - sophisticated , and almost vanished at the time Pres - ident
Wilson	PERSON	left
Europe	LOCATION	without confronting the issue .

		After the victory of the Allies our participa - tion in the general rejoicing was constantly tem - pered by a despondency based upon the conviction that
England	LOCATION	had obtained a new lease of imperial life .

		Only that section of Irish opinion which cor - responds to the
Junker	PERSON	mentality in
Germany	LOCATION	has unfeignedly rejoiced in the triumph of the Allied cause .

		Their happiness on that occasion was para - doxically insured by Sir
Edward Carson	PERSON	's emphatic assurance that
Ireland	LOCATION	would be immune from the application of the principle which the Allies had vindicated .

		When
England	LOCATION	took the field against
Germany	LOCATION	there were two policies open to Irish nationalism .

		Ireland could either decide to trust the British Gov - ernment , and join with the English people to defeat
Germany	LOCATION	, or she could fall back upon the belief that only in
England	LOCATION	's difficulty would
Ireland	LOCATION	find the opportunity of freedom , and count upon a German victory to secure Irish independence independence of
England	LOCATION	, at all events .

		In the latter event , since the active participation of
Ireland	LOCATION	on the side of the Germans was impossible , the Irish people would have to content themselves with an attitude of benevolently pro-German neutrality , framing their policy always upon the assumption of
England	LOCATION	's de - feat .

		That , in fact , was the attitude of a small sec - tion of Irish opinion , an attitude dating from many years before the actual outbreak of war , and ex - pressed by word and action in the pre-war writings and subsequent mission of
Roger Casement	ORGANIZATION	.

		What - ever the defects of such reasoning , it was , at least , logical , granted the premises , and its most conspicu - ous and intelligent exponent demonstrated tragically the sincerity of that point of view .

		It happens , however , that the policy of coopera - tion with
England	LOCATION	was the one adopted by the
Irish Nationalist	ORGANIZATION	representatives in the
House	ORGANIZATION	of Com - mons , with the approval of the vast majority of the Irish people .

		The conflict was seen to be too wide , and the principles involved too far-reaching to allow a return to the old method of meeting such crises by the simple process of saying '' against
England	LOCATION	right or wrong . ''

		When
John Redmond	PERSON	pledged
Ireland	LOCATION	for the Allies there is little doubt that he was not exceeding the wishes , though he certainly exceeded the mandate , of his people .

		They would have pardoned this technical abuse of their authority had subsequent events justified both his faith and theirs in the sense of justice of the
British Government	ORGANIZATION	.


Ireland	LOCATION	was not like
England	LOCATION	; she did not feel men - aced by German militarism ; her choice was there - 54 THE DIAL
May 17	DATE	fore conscious and reasoned , not patriotic and emo - tional .

		It is possible to pity the blindness which did not see any danger in the aggrandizement of
Prussia	LOCATION	; it is difficult for Englishmen to realize the separation of
Ireland	LOCATION	in what appeared to be the clear call of patriotism .

		It is nevertheless a fact , a most vital fact , that an Englishman 's patriotism may be an Irishman 's poison .

		The two rarely coincide , and the remarkable point is precisely their common impulse in
August , 1914	DATE	.

		How Irish nationalism was gradually robbed of its illusions is now a matter of common knowledge amongst all who have tried to acquaint themselves with the history of Anglo-Irish relations during the past four years .

		The rise to power in
England	LOCATION	of the most anti-Irish forces , political and journalistic , in the country ; the selection for office in the Cabinet of the man who preached treason and armed rebel - lion in
Ireland	LOCATION	until all faith in constitutional gov - ernment was destroyed ; the discouragement of Cath - olic recruits for the army ; the refusal at any time to make the slight concessions to local pride and sentiment which would have definitely established the part of Irish nationalism in the war these facts are now well known , and have been admitted on the authority of responsible ministers .

		Their first effect was to strengthen the hands of the minority so that the abortive insurrection of
1916	DATE	followed , marking the flare-up of the accumulated bitterness of disillu - sion .

		Rather than throw upon the professional '' loyalists '' of the minority the onus of revolt , Eng - land preferred to purchase the assistance of Sir
Edward Carson	PERSON	at the cost of
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		The expense of this bargain was only fully real - ized when it became evident that the death of a hand - ful of representative extremists had profoundly af - fected the mind of nationalist
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		Evidence accumulated to show how foolish those idealists were who had pledged the cooperation of
Ireland	LOCATION	without exacting a single guarantee .

		t People who had hesitation in taking sides with
England	LOCATION	when her chances of victory seemed most problematical , now became neutral , watching the ever-increasing ranks of
England	LOCATION	's Allies with cynical contempt or sullen hostility .

		By every known process of repres - sion , taunt , and outrage the Irish people were driven into a denial of constitutional government , and obliged to put their trust in those who promised , at any cost , to remove the agents of their undoing .

		By-elections offered opportunities for manifestations whose sole significance was their expression of dis - gust at the betrayal of a confidence given at the cost of an old and deep tradition of mistrust .

		Only an Irish Nationalist can know what it meant for him to pledge his sword for
England	LOCATION	.

		He could not know until now he has learned it by the bitter - est experience that it meant the disintegration of Irish nationalism , the destruction of constitutional - ism , and , as it now seems , the obliteration of all that was in process of achievement after a century of suf - fering and patient negotiation .

		The reward of moderation is the rise of
Sinn Fein	ORGANIZATION	.

		If the neutral and pro-German Irish were sur - prised and disappointed respectively when
Germany	LOCATION	surrendered , their plight certainly need not detain the Allies .

		The case of the pro-Ally Nationalists is altogether different .

		They are probably the most sadly deceived of all belligerents in the war , for they have nothing , not even honor , for their partic - ipation in the great crusade against Prussianism .

		Their exploits , unlike those of
Carsonia	LOCATION	, do not elicit Royal telegrams and the felicitations of the world ; their nationalism is carefully passed over in the sympathetic addresses of President
Wilson	PERSON	, who greets
Danes	PERSON	, Czecho-Slovaks , and Jugo-Slavs with so keen an appreciation of their grievances .

		Irish Nationalists are not rewarded for the virtue of be - ing pro-Ally .

		In fact , they find themselves in no better position than those of their countrymen who held aloof , or backed their enemy , the Germans .

		In
Ireland	LOCATION	they have been forced to witness the extinc - tion of the party which represented them , and to hear themselves taunted with having supported a sys - tem which they abhor no less than their political opponents .

		While
Sinn Fein	PERSON	suffers the fortunes of war and must abide by the decision against Ger - many , constitutional nationalism can neither share to the full the Unionist exultation in the Allied victory , nor bring any weight to bear against Schadenfreude of the Separatists , whom the
British Government	ORGANIZATION	delights to honor with an irresistible martyrdom .

		Thus it seems as if
Ireland	LOCATION	must be forced to the logic of the extreme revolutionary position , namely , that until
England	LOCATION	is defeated there is no hope of freedom for
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		This argument has always been in the background of Irish politics , and it emerges periodically to prompt those who have sided , at various times , with whatever enemy threatened the supremacy of
England	LOCATION	.

		Insurrectionary Ire - land has turned in the course of history to
Spain	LOCATION	, to
France	LOCATION	, and to
Germany	LOCATION	, in the hope of witness - ing the victory which would mean freedom .

		In this last war , it so happened that the principles for which
England	LOCATION	professed to stand seemed to guarantee re - sults which had never hitherto been associated with an English victory .

		The defeat of
Germany	LOCATION	could not be claimed as an English triumph , and the participation of other powers , particularly
America	LOCATION	,
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 505 gave an appearance of hope to the future .

		But the hope has with difficulty survived the gravest disap - pointments , and is now threatened with extinction as we observe the transcendental optimism of the President 's acceptance of a militarist-economic trust in lieu of a league of free peoples .

		The sweeping electoral victory of
Sinn Fein	ORGANIZATION	was intended primarily as a demonstration to the world of the Irish de - mand for self-determination .

		It was a manifesta - tion of national purpose which , we believed , could not be misunderstood , but we forgot or did not care to remember that it might easily be ignored .

		That is precisely what has happened , so far as the
Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	is concerned .

		There are not wanting advisers who hint that some more dramatic reminder of the existence ~ of this ignored , if not forgotten , small nationality is required .

		- It depends upon
America	LOCATION	whether moderate Nationalists in Ire - land will be able to parry this suggestion by refer - ence to the tangible evidence of a desire to anticipate the argument of bloodshed .

		To evade the issue is to invite revolt .

		DUBLINER .

		The
Schamberg	PERSON	Exhibition A BRAVE SPIRIT went from among us last
autumn	DATE	when
Morton L. Schamberg	PERSON	died .

		His name may be known to few even among those who read these lines , but we who had followed his work looked upon him as one of the men on whom de - pended the building up of art in
America	LOCATION	.

		Would he have remained isolated would his public still have been a small one had he attained twice his thirty-seven years ?

		Looking at the retrospective exhibition of his pictures in
New York	LOCATION	-LRB- at
Knoed	LOCATION	- ler 's until
May 24	DATE	-RRB- , noting the uncompromising character they reveal , the seriousness , the clear in - tellect , the man 's indifference to the popularity which is bought by things that too readily please , one is tempted to think that only certain rare in - dividuals would have been willing to meet him on his proud , often severe plane of research , that few would have cared to keep with him in the ascent to which he held so unfalteringly , and seen that his results at every stage and with ever-increasing full - ness were marked by a noble beauty .

		This success of his gives the best answer to the question as to whether
Schamberg	PERSON	's public would have grown with time .

		For there is a solidarity be - tween the artist and his generation , and if he ad - vances more rapidly than the laymen , one can not but see that they will follow where he has led .

		The forces which impelled him to go on are pres - ent in other men , whose slower progress is `` due to their necessary preoccupation with everyday affairs .

		No artist worth the name has ever thought he paid a high price for his freedom to advance .

		For those who have drawn the breath of that freedom know that it is the one thing in the world worth while , and the bond between the artist and his fellows is that they too want to live , and so they realize what is great in those who have lived most fully .

		The pictures before us are a record of achieve - ment .

		They add something to the world 's sources of thought and happiness , and so , from one stand - point , they pass out of the category of the experi - mental into that of the creative , the definitive .

		And yet I think their greatest interest is found when we look on them as phases of a long proges - sion , one that had given no sign of slackening when the painter 's death broke it off and brought us once more to the world-old riddle of nature 's unconcern with the destinies of men .

		One thinks of the great giants of the past who have died in their thirties , their twenties even , and before their results we can not ask for more .

		What matter whether ^ Masaccio or a
Giorgione	ORGANIZATION	died young ?

		His work was complete .

		We rebel however at the senseless - ness of fate in cases like the one before us , where there was every promise of a great expansion , every proof that the man was worthy of his increasing capabilities when the breath of an epidemic chokes the work where it was , its finest development , one that we needed sorely , forever unrevealed .

		What we have is a splendid thing ; what would have come was bound to surpass it .

		To understand how fine
Schamberg	PERSON	's pictures are , one has to know where he started .

		And to see him come up from the impossible level on which he was twenty years ago is to convince oneself again of that solidarity among men of which I spoke be - fore .

		The advance that one man could make crea - tively , in his work , others are making receptively , in their appreciation .

		Not more than fifteen years carried
Morton L. Schamberg	PERSON	from a type of '' pretty-girl picture , '' as grotesquely cheap as any - thing in the cheap magazines , to a work that had to be counted among the significant productions of our time .

		I should not venture for fear of personal prejudice in his favor on a statement so strong as my last if it were not amply confirmed by the judg - 506 THE DIAL
May 17	DATE	ment of many competent men , both American and foreign .

		It was
William M. Chase	PERSON	who first directed
Schamberg	PERSON	's attention to art the ideas he first had in his student days , as an architect , and as a victim of the abominations of popular art -LRB- a misnomer currently applied to commercial art -RRB- , being merely obstacles he had to overcome when he had once started on his career .

		The first years of it were spent in somewhat the usual manner of serious and active students of art in academic training and a questioning of the old masters .

		To be sure it was only certain sections of the museums which were consulted and not until the
winter of 1908-09	DATE	did
Schamberg	PERSON	discover , at
Florence	LOCATION	and
Siena	LOCATION	, the meaning of the great tradition which was to open his eyes to the falsity for him at least of nineteenth century naturalism .

		On his return to
Paris	LOCATION	he was ready to appreciate what the great Frenchmen of our time had accom - plished in setting art upon a truer basis than that which their predecessors had had .

		It is from this point that
Schamberg	PERSON	's real work is to be reckoned .

		The present exhibition is arranged with that fact in mind , nothing of his production before his last and critically important stay in
Europe	LOCATION	being included , though in the years preceding there were quite hon - orable qualities in his work .

		The last years of his work may be divided with some distinctness into periods .

		For a time he worked in strong color ,
Matisse	ORGANIZATION	and the Chinese and Persian ceramists being his influences .

		It is remarkable to note how far he went in mastering their quality .

		Painting with a new ardor , this man , the passion of whose nature seems hardly suited to the type of expression which we think of among colorists , let himself go with an unwonted vehem - ence , and the pictures of
1911	DATE	and
1912	DATE	show that his color sense was genuine and strong .

		But he was still working with the ideas of the older men among the moderns ; by
1913	DATE	or
1914	DATE	he had caught up with his generation and was painting in a way which not only placed him in line with his contem - poraries but which was unquestionably better suited to his own temperament .

		The change was from reliance on instinct the unconscious factor to the guidance of reason .

		His paintings in the Cubistic manner were among the very first in
America	LOCATION	and will probably long remain among the best .

		As fine as they were , he still saw in them re - minders of his old years of naturalism and of the preciosity that fastened itself on the '' men of the brush '' of
1870	DATE	.

		Some of the Frenchmen , notably
Duchamp	PERSON	, had already used machinery as their sub - jects , ostensible or real , and
Schamberg	PERSON	had appre - ciated the fineness of their work .

		He did not follow them however until , by a chance , he was led by circumstances outside of his painting to consider the beauty which the makers of machines lent to their work .

		His incentive in painting themes drawn from the field of mechanics was therefore first-hand observation quite as much as the lead given by other men .

		His pictures of this period will surely be ranked among his best .

		If I may intrude a personal preference , it is for those in which his rich store of the traditional esthetic qualities unites with the vigor of his new outlook , the exhilaration of handling a perfectly fresh sub - ject being supported rather than checked by the self-control that was native and natural with him .

		Few men were more stirred by the war than
Schamberg	PERSON	, and from the beginning of it his logical mind was working at fever heat with its problems .

		He went down step by step to the underlying forces at work and the turmoil of doubt , indignation , and resentment in which he lived was not conducive to painting .

		He was never a partisan save of truth , which seemed to him the monopoly of none of the belligerents .

		He had striven unremittingly in art for truth , and the falsity of the appeal to might which comes in even a righteous war was a thing to which he could not reconcile himself .

		When the torture of his conflicting ideas on the war had done its ut - most and when , at the same time
last summer	DATE	, cer - tain new ideas of art came to crystallize in his mind , he produced the series of water-colors which mark the end of his career .

		Thoughtless observers will take the accurate notation of objects in these works as a sign that
Schamberg	PERSON	had repented of his `` heresies '' of the preceding years and had come back as a sheep to the fold .

		If these people can not see that his last pictures are built on the earlier works and contain their qualities in a purer and more intense form the drawing , the color , the character they should at least understand , at this exhibition , that for the man who had painted the pictures of
1910	DATE	to
1916	DATE	there was no turning back ; such men can only go onward .

		I have tried to write of him impersonally and objectively , and with regard to the ideal of his art a white fire that he tended and increased and that throws a light on the youth of
America	LOCATION	in his time .

		If there was one such spirit here , then there were many .

		It does not matter whether they speak through one medium or another : they are here , and they will speak , as strongly and as straight as did the man we have lost .

		Fortunately the body of work he has left is enough to let us know him .

		And the talent , the probity , the love that were in him are in his work and will make it endure .

		WALTER PACK .

		1919 THE DIAL 50 ?

		Ivan Speaks These sayings on war and peace were set down by
Madame Fedorchenko	PERSON	, a Russian nurse , from talks which she overheard among Russian soldiers at the front in
1915	DATE	,
1916	DATE	, and
1917	DATE	.

		From a large amount of material they are selected , translated , and arranged .

		These de - tached utterances of wounded soldiers , many of whom could neither read nor write , lying in their cots , were spoken without premeditation or thought of the nurse 's presence .

		Beyond translation , they are printed absolutely without change .

		For this reason they penetrate and reveal the mystery of Russian character .

		JL HIS IS ALL Mr.
Whittemore	PERSON	has to say in Ivan Speaks -LRB- translated from the Russian by
Thomas Whittemore	PERSON	.

		Houghton MifHin ;
Boston	LOCATION	-RRB- , by way of preface or introduction .

		The sayings are sub - mitted , without interpretation , direct to the English - reading public .

		They are as near the aboriginal of the Russian peasant psyche as can be documents that have undergone selection and arrangement at the hands of so too civilized and sensitive a spirit as Mr.
Whittemore	PERSON	's .

		He , his tastes , his opinions , and his philosophy of life are an invisible and pervasive re - fractive medium through which the material comes to the reader .

		One feels that one either ought to know all about Mr.
Whittemore	PERSON	who selects and arranges , or to have the residue of the `` large amount '' from which the selection and arrangement have been made .

		From the point of view of those who desire a genuine understanding of what has been going on in
Russia	LOCATION	, in terms of the original qualities of Russian men , the latter is the consumma - tion more to be desired .

		Mr.
Whittemore	PERSON	will , we hope , publish the rest of his material before long .

		What he has already published may be said in - deed to `` penetrate and reveal the mystery of Russian character . ''

		He exhibits in nearness and intimacy the quality of spirit that makes Russian literature a cult among non-Russians , and the Russian people a religion with such temperaments as Mr.
Stephen Graham	PERSON	's .

		It is at once the most hopeful and dis - illusioning publication about
Russia	LOCATION	that has come to hand .

		Disillusioning because the `` mystery of Russian character '' which it `` penetrates and reveals '' turns out to be no mystery whatsover in the Russian himself .

		It turns out to be the embarrassment and wonder and unreadiness of the sophisticated
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean the
Continental	ORGANIZATION	European with his mores of insincerity and the Anglo-Saxon European with his mores of repression before a personal quality that is at once straightforward and uninhibited .

		All adults have felt the same wonder and unreadiness and embarrassment in the presence of some child not yet perverted by education from the simplicity of free thinking and straight speaking .

		All have felt `` mystery '' in children , and have enveloped them in `` clouds of glory . ''

		All have been committing the same pathetic psychologist 's fallacy of imaging the subject of their contemplation in the stuff of their own mentality and passion .

		It has been perpetra - ted upon the Russian without laughter , and at great cost .

		The disillusion can not come too swiftly that the `` mystery of Russian character '' lies in the fact that Russian character is simple , direct , sensitive , and liberal , precisely as a child 's is .

		In this , also , lies its hopefulness .

		Saved by a benevolent bureau - cracy from the curse of literacy , and by a sanitary economic system which reserved industrial organiza - tion and skill for foreigners , particularly Germans , from the bitter sophistications of industry , the Russian peasant remained close to the community of earth , profoundly a part of his commune and in every way dependent on it .

		The `` revolutionary '' gospel of the Soviet was to him largely a common - place of the daily life , and this subversive commun - ism to which he was invited was so ordinary as to stir in him no excitement .

		It was the Revolutionary promise of education that excited him , for he felt `` dark ; '' the challenge of authority excited him , for he had the submissiveness of a child who has never known freedom ; and the division of the land excited him because it promised to meet his great need .

		But that was all .

		For the rest , just what seems to the possessing classes of
Europe	LOCATION	most revolutionary in Bolshevism seemed most natural to him .

		The Socialist economics was the only economics he had learned , and he took it simply and literally .

		The creative foundations were natural to him ; the rest would pass , like other artefacts , in God 's good time .

		The foregoing , however , is already inference from the quality of Russian character which Mr.
Whitte	PERSON	- more 's pellucid translations exhibit .

		The speeches throw the mind at once back to Homeric poems , and to some of the great ironic simplicities of the Old Testament narratives .

		Nothing is held in reserve , nothing repressed and nothing is made ignoble or unclean : lust , drunkenness , superstition , greed , honor , ambition , courage , pity , irony , love , and com - radeship , the conventions of home and community , the uprootedness of barrack and battlefield , all pos - sessed of that certain dignity with which only straight speaking and straight thinking can suffuse the deeds and passions of men .

		It is the solidity and healthy-mindedness of natural being , indeed , that transfigures all the sayings .

		They are , together 5 o8 THE DIAL
May 17	DATE	with the ghosts of Christianity that figure in them , clean pagan , pagan clean .

		They are astoundingly free from animosity ; the quality they register is as - toundingly esthetic thus : '' I took aim at him , and did not know who it was , but hoped it would turn out to be a German .

		I aimed from a tren , ch .

		I took long aim , and shot very luckily .

		He fell flat , and turned out to be a German , and healthy as a bull . ''

		If this seems cruel and insensitive , one need only turn to the many expressions of pity , even in action .

		What it truly utters is the sensuous realization of the business in hand , the childlike absorption in the thing doing .

		Beneath it , and all the other words lies the sense of a living nature , which is so patent in the spirit of the unconverted young : I was allowed to go out .

		I went to see the animals and the birds .

		What beauty unspeakable there is in the world !

		Some birds are clothed in feathers of every hue in the rainbow , and have eyes like precious stones .

		And such animals !

		Incredible !

		There is the lion , now , the king of beasts .

		The crowd stands around him , gaping with idle curiosity .

		But he lies quiet and wo n't stir , and looks right through you , as if you were not there at all .

		He is seeing something of his own , quite different .

		You feel the strength under that hide , a strength like cast steel ; and his very calm is terrible .

		Believe it or not , as you will , but the earth breathes .

		Only your ear is not always attuned to hear it .

		Life makes too great a noise around you ; we never have leisure , either to look or to listen closely .

		But there are peculiar days and nights when the soul tears itself from the material and sees and hears earth live , as you might say , her own separate life .

		She stirs the swaying grasses and the waters ; breathes in vapor , in mists , in the fragrance of flowers , in the exhalations of all living things .

		So immense is the life of the earth that man can sense it only by feeling , not from knowl - edge .

		I think monastic life is the real thing , the stillness that could make many think clear ; but where find such retreats ?


H. M. KALLEN	PERSON	.

		The Historical West IT is NOW almost fifty years since
Mark Twain	PERSON	, in the first chapter of Life on the
Mississippi	LOCATION	, undertook by a clever comparison of dates to ex - plode the fallacy that
America	LOCATION	, speaking historically , is a mere infant in arms .

		Today , when we boast of the oldest national flag , the chapter has lost some of its edge .

		Such are the changes of half a century .

		But in
1874	DATE	Pioneers of
France	LOCATION	in the
New World	LOCATION	, the first of the Parkman narratives , was not yet ten years old ; the historical societies of the
Middle West	LOCATION	had just begun their invaluable labors ; fifteen years were to elapse before
Roosevelt	PERSON	was to draw popu - lar attention to the winning of the West ; and no - body had dreamed of Professor
Turner	PERSON	's epochal discovery of the significance of the frontier .

		When
Clemens	PERSON	wrote , American history was convention - ally the tale of
Jamestown	LOCATION	and of the Pilgrim fathers with the rest of the continent stuck on like a fringe .

		But now the middle west is proudly conscious of being antique .

		University courses are devoted to its history .

		It has been discovered by
Meredith Nicholson	PERSON	and eastern literati .

		Vachel
Lindsay	PERSON	has seen historical ghosts in the streets of
Spring	DATE	- field .

		The Spoon River Anthology exhibits all the crimes of decadent
Rome	LOCATION	.

		We have read
Hamlin Garland	PERSON	's A Son of the
Middle Border	ORGANIZATION	and found there the winey flavor of things historic .

		Some of us are familiar with
Reuben Gold Thwaites	PERSON	and some of us , beholding ` the
St. Louis	LOCATION	pageant , know that the mound builders are part of our history .

		, Two volumes recently published in The
Chroni	PERSON	- cles of
America	LOCATION	series -LRB-
Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	; New Haven -RRB- ^ mphasize our antiquity .

		In Crusaders of
New France	LOCATION	, by
William Bennett Munro	PERSON	,
Cartier	ORGANIZATION	and Richelieu ,
Champlain	LOCATION	and
Louis XIV	PERSON	, naked
Huron Indians	PERSON	and men of the
Regiment de Carig	ORGANIZATION	- nan-Salieres elbow each other for attention .

		Mr.
George M. Wrong	PERSON	in The Conquest of
New France	LOCATION	is even more of a showman .

		One turns from
Titus Oates	PERSON	to the conquest of Louisbourg , .

		from the intrigues of
Versailles	LOCATION	and
Vienna	LOCATION	to the planting of old-world names , like that of
Fort Maurepas	LOCATION	, in the wilderness .

		If the transition from
Marlborough	LOCATION	to
Mandan	LOCATION	Indian culture is at times a little precipitate , it is none the less exhila - rating .

		Allusions to European affairs are thicker than blackberries and furnish excellent gymnastics for the memory .

		In the best sense , both authors are popular his - torians .

		Both suffer under the disability of the inevitable comparison with
Parkman	PERSON	.

		Perhaps a lurking fear of this accounts for the flatness of Mr.
Munro	PERSON	's chapter on
LaSalle	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is the dreariest thing in his book .

		With Mr. Wrong the chal - lenge is even more direct . ''

		After
Parkman	PERSON	, '' said
Roosevelt	PERSON	in his address as president of the
Ameri	PERSON	- can Historical Society , '' had written of
Montcalm	LOCATION	and
Wolfe	PERSON	there was left for other writers only what
Fitzgerald	PERSON	left for other translators of
Omar Khayyam	PERSON	. ''

		If the comparison is not just to the painstaking American who reigns , like
Gibbon	PERSON	, the sole master of his field , the point is nevertheless well taken .

		Mr.
Wrong	PERSON	, however , dexterously avoids THE DIAL 509 a sustained parallel by breaking his book in two with a long excursus devoted to the explorations of La Verendrye and his followers , of
Hendry	ORGANIZATION	and Saint-Pierre .

		Their heroic exploits rouse him to a pitch of enthusiasm not unworthy of the great his - torian .

		The Crusaders of
New France	LOCATION	falls into a seri - ous difficulty , best described by Mr.
Crothers	PERSON	in one of his most entertaining essays .

		That amusing author , writing on The World 's Worst Books , details at length the struggles of a writer compelled to mix in one volume information on the Chosen People and observations on '' our gallinaceous fowls . ''

		Mr.
Munro	PERSON	is in a similar pickle .

		After his preliminary chapter on
France	LOCATION	as a colonizing country , he has only five chapters , totalling less than one hundred pages , to devote to the whole his - tory of French exploration from
Carrier	ORGANIZATION	's first voy - age in
1534	DATE	to the the death of
LaSalle	ORGANIZATION	in
1687	DATE	.

		This compression is fatal to anything like adequate treatment .

		Five more chapters , the most interest - ing part of the book , are given to a discussion of life in
New France	LOCATION	, one each being devoted to the Jesuits , the seigneurs , and the coureurs-de-bois , and two to the life of the colony proper .

		As a result the title of his study must be stretched outrageously to cover two subjects , neither of which can be treated in half a book .

		General readers will find these last five chapters an interesting corrective to
Parkman	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Munro	PERSON	shows that the organization of
New France	LOCATION	was far better adapted to Canadian conditions than is gen - erally supposed .

		The feudal system which in
France	LOCATION	was obsolescent achieved in
Canada	LOCATION	'' a restored vitality . ''

		The centralized government in church and state made possible the long resistance of the French to the numerically powerful but mutually jealous plantations of the English .

		In - deed , had Canadian affairs been even more central - ized in
1759	DATE	; had the incompetent
Vaudreuil	PERSON	not interfered ; had the entire management of the colony been given to
Montcalm	LOCATION	,
Quebec	LOCATION	might have held out against the English for an indefinite period .

		Certainly Frontenac was able to launch the entire strength of the colony against the English with an effectiveness that
Montcalm	LOCATION	could only despair of .

		The
Conquest of New France	ORGANIZATION	presents a smaller and more manageable sector of history .

		The nar - rative really begins with the second administration of Frontenac in
1689	DATE	, and ends with the fall of
Quebec	LOCATION	in
1759	DATE	exactly seventy years .

		The treaty of
Paris	LOCATION	-LRB- 1763 -RRB- and the final withdrawal of the French from
North America	LOCATION	form an epilogue to the battle of the Plains of Abraham and are so treated .

		It is the aim of Mr. Wrong to present the strug - gle for
Canada	LOCATION	as part of the world conflict begun by Louis XIV and ended by the efficiency of
Pitt	PERSON	.

		This is undoubtedly the proper method of attack , but it is difficult matter for a small book of 246 pages .

		He undertakes to present the varying
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean situation , and from that to argue the policies of the rival governments .

		He is compelled to hurry from
India	LOCATION	to the valley of the
Ohio	LOCATION	, from the character of Madame Pompadour to the idiosyn - crasies of the
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	legislature .

		He also sketches the characters and the biographies of the principal personages , and , in addition , devotes forty - seven pages a fifth of the book to the fascinating but subsidiary story of French exploration in the
Far West	LOCATION	.

		As a result he has had to pay tribute to compres - sion .

		The final capture of
Louisbourg	LOCATION	, of
Fort Duquesne	LOCATION	, of Fort Frontenac , '' giving command of
Lake Ontario	LOCATION	and , with it , the west '' these are dismissed with a word .

		The defeat of
Braddock	PERSON	is not sufficiently developed and the exploits of the young
Washington	LOCATION	are given disproportionate space .

		And yet , under these accumulated problems , Mr.
Wrong	PERSON	has produced a unity of impression that is a tribute to his structural powers .

		The fall of French power in
America	LOCATION	, indeed , is like a great play a play in five acts of which the titles are
Frontenac	ORGANIZATION	,
Acadia	LOCATION	,
Louisbourg	LOCATION	, the
Ohio	LOCATION	,
Montcalm	LOCATION	and
Wolfe	PERSON	.

		This Mr.
Wrong	PERSON	has seen , and has frequently opposed his figures with apposite dramatic effect .

		He is interested in character .

		Frontenac , '' the showy court figure '' with genius in it , whose '' guests were expected to admire his indifferent horses as the finest to be seen , his gardens as the most beautiful , his clothes as of the most effective cut and finish , the plate on his table as of the best workmanship , and the food as having a superior flavor '' Frontenac is superbly drawn .

		His foil is
Phipps	LOCATION	, half pirate and half captain of industry , governor of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, and burner of witches .

		If the figures of
Montcalm	LOCATION	and
Wolfe	PERSON	seem less vividly cut , it is only because they are more familiar .

		A word should be devoted to the form of the books in this series .

		The illustrations , the type , the binding , are alike attractive , and represent a high achievement in bookmaking .

		The present edition is the
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	edition ; it must be confessed that these aristocratic volumes are more in the spirit of
Chester A. Arthur	PERSON	than of the
Illinois	LOCATION	rail-splitter .

		Yet one can take pleasure in their format and wish that Lincoln might have owned them .

		HOWARD
MUMFORD JONES	ORGANIZATION	.

		510 THE DIAL
May 17	DATE	Letters to Unknown Women JLo LA GROSSE MARGOT : There are moments , not rare unhappily , when our dreams of the beauty of Greek women , our senti - mentalizings over past loveliness , seem sickly and inane .

		We try to persuade ourselves with soft words that life is delicate , but too surely we are shocked back to a grim realization of true ugliness , true hor - ror , true futility .

		And at such moments life , which we had symbolized as some myrrh-tressed Heliodora , resembles one of those desperate cynicisms of Rops , where the painted lovely face of the courtesan slips off like a mask and shows the yellow hag beneath .

		That mood finds its symbol in you .

		Day after day drags past and we know too surely that the bright rapture is leaving us , that the gay shades of our dreams grow fainter , the power of beauty less potent .

		There were days when the sense of fascination in choice exquisite things almost stifled us , when we spent hours upon hours in some sunlit Italian garden or shut out the gloom of No - vember with the patterns of
Hokusai	ORGANIZATION	and
Utamaro	PERSON	.

		Now these things are a cause only of infinite regret , having about them the pathos of bright playthings with which men tried to deceive the gloomy truth , to gild the leaden reality .

		Villon wrote of
Helen	PERSON	and
Flora	PERSON	, but you were his life .

		For in the des - peration of that moment when men see that truth is other than they had dreamed they may revolt from an impossible beauty to mere dulling bestiality .

		Had we not seen his own words we could scarcely believe that he who mourned over the dead ladies of old times , likening them to the melted snow of yester - year , could have lived with you in a brothel .

		Per - haps we did not quite understand it until in this age and generation the horrors of the world , hidden un - der a light mask of gayety , became suddenly alert and dangerous .

		The time in which you lived was horrible indeed .


Europe	LOCATION	was desolate with wars and with civil war ; in the villages there was no safety ; fields were burnt and ravaged ; within the walls of cities murder and treachery lurked and the plague ran like flame along the narrow streets ; in the woods to which men fled for safety lay starvation or a wretched death from fierce beasts .

		In the daytime your
Paris	LOCATION	knew many shameful things made more bitter by the contrast of mad luxury with utmost poverty ; and at
night	TIME	, as Hugo tells us , those who stood on the tower of Our Lady could see the dull glare of burning vil - lages and trembled for the safety of their city walls .

		Little wonder , then , if the poor scholar became a thief , and Flora the beautiful Roman gave place to the gross
Margot	PERSON	.

		Like a branch of fruited oak flung in the mud the poet 's soul became filthy in the ordure of his age .

		There seemed no place for him ; and indeed the world has no place for such as he .

		But we can not forget that the age which produced you , produced also
Jeanne d'Arc	PERSON	, that the very mo - ment when you and
Villon	PERSON	were deep in the filth of degradation ,
Ficino	PERSON	and Poliziano were declaiming with sonorous eloquence of Plato and of perfect beauty and perfect knowledge , and that
Botticelli	PERSON	was dreaming his ` Madonnas .

		If we were really con - vinced that life is as bestial as you seem to make it there would be nothing for us but the `` bare bodkin '' or the ignoble gibbet your poet eventually honored with his neck .

		We do not believe it , we can not ; we deceive ourselves if deception be necessary ; we put aside the horrors and the filth which we know to be true , but we claim that the beauty is true also .

		We do not condemn , we accept you .

		Misery upon mis - ery , disgust upon disgust , we know that they exist , that for every sensitive soul the loathsomeness of
La Grosse Margot	ORGANIZATION	is a cruel spiritual fact , but we know also that the bright toys are not wholly toys but symbols of truth , truth itself .

		We do not need to interpret this horror in confused geometric shapes of sullen color or to torture the
Muse	ORGANIZATION	's mouth to the utterance of harsh discordance .

		We say : '' There are rose-wreaths and the foulness of dead men ; Greek song and the groans of murder ; tall trees un - der a pale opaque sky and the mephitic gloom of narrow streets we know it , we accept it , but we choose among these things and choose for ourselves rose-wreath and song and the clear air . ''

		Horror may be forced upon us , but the purity of white marble has entered our souls and can not be permanently stained ; the grosse
Margot	PERSON	may gibber at us from street corners with foul words and ob - scene gesture we are not harmed , for Heliodora loves us ; we may be forced towards crime , but we can not be made criminal .

		Even Villon escaped from you , if not by disgust , by the gallows ; and by death he purged from his soul that '' accidia '' which I have called the '' cruel spiritual fact '' of La Grosse Mar - got .

		Perhaps you can not see these things , sneer that the harm you do is irrevocable ; but ,
Margot	PERSON	, the gods feed their sparrows and will doubtless release their nightingales from the snare .

ALDINGTON	PERSON	.

		THE DIAL
ROBERT MORSS LOVETT	PERSON	, Editor In Charge of the Reconstruction Program :
JOHN DEWEY THORSTEIN VEBLEN CLARENCE BRITTEN HELEN MAROT	PERSON	HE WAR WAS WON BY
AMERICA	LOCATION	.

		WlTH ALL possible subtractions from our achievement it is clear that but for American food , American munitions , American money , and American men , the Allies would have been compelled to negotiate a peace in
1917	DATE	, or accept a dictated peace in
1918	DATE	.

		At the time of
America	LOCATION	's entrance into the war the belief was general that her influence would result in a peace which would be righteous and permanent .

		The foundations for such a peace were announced by President
Wilson	PERSON	in his address to the
United States Senate	ORGANIZATION	on
January 22 , 1917	DATE	.

		He said '' Only a peace between equals can last .

		Only a peace the very principle of which is equality and a common participation in a common benefit . ''

		On
April 2	DATE	, on the eve of entering the war , he explicitly confirmed this view of the peace to be sought . ''

		I have ex - actly the same things in mind now that I had in mind when I addressed the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	on the twenty - second of
January	DATE	last . ''

		On
August 27	DATE	in his reply to the proposals for peace issued by the Pope he asserted that the basis of peace was '' the rights of peoples ... their equal right to freedom and security and self-government and to a participation upon fair terms in the economic opportunities of the world , the German people , of course , included if they will accept equality and not seek domination . ''

		There followed on
January 8 , 1918	DATE	, the statement of explicit terms in ' the famous fourteen , points .

		America won the war ;
America	LOCATION	has lost the peace , the object for which she fought .

		It is a thankless task to bring in a bill of particulars to show in detail how one by one the fourteen points to which
America	LOCATION	and the Allies bound themselves have been abrogated by the actual pact .

		On Jan -
uary 22 , 1917	DATE	, President
Wilson	PERSON	had declared that '' the freedom of the seas is the sine qua non of peace , equality , and cooperation , '' yet this was the first article of the fourteen to be withdrawn from con - sideration before the Armistice was signed .

		The grant of
Upper Silesia	LOCATION	to
Poland	LOCATION	, of
Southern Tyrol	LOCATION	to
Italy	LOCATION	are not only violations of an agree - ment made with a beaten enemy : they are clear vio - lations of that international order which
America	LOCATION	fought to establish , crimes against the peace of the world .

		The terms of the grant , of
Kiaochau	LOCATION	and Shantung to
Japan	LOCATION	, of the Dodecanese to
Italy	LOCATION	, are violations of the fourteen points at the expense not of the enemy but of allies .

		In the territorial estab - lishment of new states , Jugo-Slavia ,
Czecho	PERSON	- slovakia ,
Poland	LOCATION	, difficult questions arose which did not admit of any clean cut application of the fourteen points , but in the claims of
Japan	LOCATION	on
China	LOCATION	there was but a single issue to be maintained or compromised , that of right , justice , and truth .

		The treaty not only cancels the principle of '' equality and participation in a common benefit '' as respects the late enemy ; it withdraws it among the Allies themselves .

		America has won the war but has lost the peace .

		With far greater reason than
Clemenceau	PERSON	President
Wilson	PERSON	may lament a Pyrrhic victory .

		T .

		HE REASONS FOR THE DEFEAT OF
AMERICA	LOCATION	ARE easily to be read .

		They go back to our entrance into the war in
April 1917	DATE	.

		It is clear that Presi - dent
Wilson	PERSON	was hurried .

		He would have preferred to meet
Congress	ORGANIZATION	in extra session in
May	DATE	, but the war-at-any-price party forced his hand in
April	DATE	.

		If the longer interval had been allowed it is possible that an arrangement might have been arrived at be - tween
America	LOCATION	and the Entente , including a state - ment of war aims .

		Such a negotiation would at least have revealed the existence of the Treaties of
London	LOCATION	, and the common necessity of the Allies might have led to their common renunciation of the aims of those secret instruments .

		However , time was not granted .

		We entered the war more immediately dependent on the Entente nations for means to carry it on than the latter were upon us , bound by necessity to peoples who were fighting for secret ends utterly at variance with our own .

		Even then it might have been possible to save the situa - tion had President
Wilson	PERSON	issued promptly a state - ment of the war aims of the
United States	LOCATION	, and de - fined the basis upon which he would cooperate with the Allies ; but this he showed a fierce reluctance to do , accusing those who advised such action of seek - ing to embarrass him in the conduct of the war , and in his letter to Congressman
Heflin	PERSON	disingenuously trying to confuse the demand for war aims with a profession of ignorance as to why we were at war at all .

		He insisted that his general statements of
January 22	DATE	and
April 2	DATE	were all-sufficient .

		In
August	DATE	, however , he assumed to reply to the Pope 's proposals in the sense of his
January	DATE	speech , as com - mon spokesman of the nations fighting
Germany	LOCATION	; and in the
January	DATE	following he issued the famous 5 12 THE DIAL
May 17	DATE	fourteen points .

		Though these were received with general agreement he later challenged the Allies to express dissent if such existed .

		The points were reaffirmed in his speech of
April 6	DATE	, and in the most solemn fashion .

		They were put forward by Ger - many as the basis of her surrender and , with two exceptions , specifically accepted by the other warring nations .

		But even with all this open diplomacy he failed to bind the Allies to the terms of world settle - ment which he had announced .

		It is obvious now that they had always made reservations in favor of the secret treaties of
London	LOCATION	.

		When President
Wilson	PERSON	learned of the terms of these agreements is uncertain .

		It may have been only when they were published by the Soviet Government of
Russia	LOCATION	.

		In any case , however , the moment of his first knowledge of these treaties was the time when he could have moved for their specific subordination to his own terms with best chance of success .

		If Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	trusted entirely in the acceptance of his fourteen points by the Allies he must have been rudely shocked by the behavior of
Lloyd George	PERSON	and
Clemenceau	PERSON	in promising their tax-payers to collect the entire cost of the war in the form of a German indemnity .

		He must have gone to the Peace Con - ference with a clear presage of defeat .

		And in fact he has seen his own terms , and those on which Ger - many surrendered , repeatedly repudiated in favor of those of the secret understandings .

		From
France	LOCATION	he has apparently been able to purchase certain con - cessions in regard to the left bank of the Rhine by more or less definite promises of support in event of future attack by
Germany	LOCATION	.

		In regard to
Japan	LOCATION	his hands were tied by a secret arrangement of his own the Lansing-Ishii agreement and the situa - tion has been further complicated by the fact that he was constrained to purchase support for the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	at home and in the English colonies by a refusal to accept the clause granting equal recogni - tion to citizens of all nations .

		Despite the eloquent and * pathetic plea of the Chinese delegation Kiao - chau and the Shantung peninsula have been turned over to
Japan	LOCATION	, to relinquish when and how she may determine .

		Baron
Makino	PERSON	's claim that this procedure was in recognition of the fact that
Japan	LOCATION	had proved always faithful to her international agreements must have extorted a smile even from Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	, as he ~ recalled the Russo-Japanese agreement of
April 25 , 1898	DATE	in which both govern - ments recognized the sovereignty and entire inde - pendence of
Korea	LOCATION	and pledged themselves mutually to abstain from all direct interference in the internal affairs of that country a pledge subsequently re - asserted in agreements of
Japan	LOCATION	with
China	LOCATION	and with
Korea	LOCATION	herself .

		In regard to
Italy	LOCATION	Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	found no resting place in his retreat to the line drawn by the Treaty of
London	LOCATION	, short of Fiume , which
Italy	LOCATION	claimed in excess of that settlement .

		We can appreciate the feeling of the Italians that Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's insistance on the exact limitations of this secret pact is to be explained , in view of the general surrender of his fourteen points , only by some special grudge against their country .

		Of course this is absurd .

		Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	needs Fiume more than the Italians do : he needs it as the symbol of his victorious idealism the sign that he knows how to get what he wants .

		If it were permissible for Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	to accept a patent of nobility from some foreign power we should suggest as the appro - priate title ,
Lord Wilson of Fiume	ORGANIZATION	.

		HE ABANDONMENT OF THE FOURTEEN POINTS was the price which Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	paid for the form of peace - which he has secured under the title
The League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	.

		He will doubtless base his claim to the success of his mission to
Europe	LOCATION	on this .

		achievement , and already it is being `` hailed as a triumph of practical statesmanship over the futile aspirations and feeble scruples of the idealists of whom Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	used to be accounted one .

		It should be pointed out , however , that the process by which the League was secured , that of paltering with the principles on which it was to have been based , goes far to discredit it in its inception .

		The true relation between the Covenant and the Treaty has been reversed .

		The Covenant was put forward as a pledge and a promise to be made good by sub - sequent action beginning with the Treaty of peace .

		Instead of this the Treaty has been used to buy sup - port , or worse , to buy off opposition , to the League .

		Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	is an architect who robs his foundation of stone to build flying buttresses .

		He is the mother fleeing in a sledge from wolves , holding to her bosom her last born and throwing her other children suc - cessively to the devouring pack .

		Whether the child is worth the sacrifice is for the future to show .

		The League with which Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	escaped is not a society of peoples , a new social order .

		It is a politi - cal instrument , and as such it enters on its career handicapped by the political compromises and decep - tions which marked its origin .

		A League which is frankly in perpetuation of the victorious alliance , which excludes from membership the nations with which we were at war , which denies the right of nations to choose for themselves a form of economic democracy hostile to the institution of private prop - erty , which recognizes at the outset territorial arrangements in direct contravention of the principle of self-determination of nationalities , which does not require disarmament even among the signatory nations against each other , which does not assert the equality of citizenship of those nations or the free - dom of the seas , which makes no provision for the liquidation of empires and the raising to the status of self-government of peoples now held in political bondage , which does not look toward freedom of trade or movement such a League with such powers and processes as are allowed it is all too weak for its assigned task .

		Yet this League is the net positive result of the participation of the
United States	LOCATION	in the war this and Fiume .

		It is to be hoped that on his return to his native land President Wil -
1919	DATE	THE DIAL son will not seek to exaggerate his triumph for reasons of partisan or personal glory .

		The con - dition of the success of the
League	ORGANIZATION	is recognition of the function to which it has been limited , that of a temporary receivership of a bankrupt world .

		More clearly than when it was first presented the Covenant appears in the light of a task , to be per - formed , if at all , only by such an initial repudiation of the men and the methods instrumental in draw - ing it up as to amount to conversion , to regeneration , to revolution .

		We suggest therefore that the proper mood for the reception of President
Wilson	PERSON	on his return is that of the old Puritan day of fasting ^ humiliation , and prayer .

		N , OTHING WHICH THE PEACE CONFERENCE HAS proposed will excite less opposition than the recom - mendations of its labor commissioners .

		The recom - mendations convey a gratifying sense that of all the problems now before the world awaiting solution none is so simple or requires so little readjustment of interests as the relation of capital to labor .

		One may turn from the outdoor turmoil in
Europe	LOCATION	, and even in the
United States	LOCATION	, as from a bad dream to the report of the
Commission on Industrial Labor Legislation of the Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	and be assured that the hour of peace has struck and `` all is well '' in industry .

		The declaration of these Commis - sioners that no child under 14 years should be per - mitted in industry ; that every worker has a right to a wage commensurate with civilized standards of living ; that every worker should enjoy one day of rest in seven ; that forty-eight hours wherever indus - trial development permits should constitute a week 's work , will receive the endorsement of the
Whitley Commission	ORGANIZATION	of the large organizations of employers in
England	LOCATION	, and even of the
Chambers of Commerce	ORGANIZATION	in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Everyone in all parts of the globe , except in certain backward regions where industrial life is still primitive , is saying as much .

		But it is noteworthy that wherever this pious wish is expressed in the report there is the expectation that it will stand as a promissory note for the sometime enforcement and that reasonable time will of course be allowed for the fulfillment of these ideals .

		The ways of enforcement it is understood are fraught with technicalities which must perforce take prece - dence as they are concerned with the realities of routine rather than the abstractions of human rights .

		As a matter of fact , the
High Contracting Parties of the Labor Commission	ORGANIZATION	steep in mystery the ways and means of enforcing their own decrees as to labor rights and standards .

		There is a hint in their pro- posals that some dire fate will befall a nation which does not accept the precepts .

		But what that fate or penalty is they do not explain .

		However , there is a clear assumption that the highest of the
High Commissioners	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- which must mean
Great Britain	LOCATION	, the
United States	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and
Japan	LOCATION	-RRB- already ob - serve those ethical precepts .

		It appears that they are so taken to heart by the governments of these countries that these same governments are eager and ready at the sacrifice of the interests of their own business men to carry on trade wars against those nations which fail to observe ethical standards of industrial relationship .

		If indeed these High Com - missioners know better than the rest of us about what they are talking that is , if , the governments of their countries have actually taken this matter to heart the point for which the old-line trade unions have been fighting is cleared up and the al - liance between stand-pat unionism and stand-pat business is consummated .

		If this is the case the wage standards of the regular unions of the
United States	LOCATION	and
Great Britain	LOCATION	are to be protected as the prices of commodities are now protected by the
United States	ORGANIZATION	tariff , and special labor interests like special business interests will be cared for .

		Such a contemplated scheme , naively supported by reformers in a spirit of universal uplift , has as much relation to a progressive civilization as a tariff imposed for the support of infant industries , but no more .

		The declaration ` of the High Contracting Parties that the '' labor of human beings should not be treated as merchandise or articles of commerce is a restatement of Mr.
Gompers	PERSON	' familiar formula that labor is not a commodity .

		But as that is exactly what labor is in the wage system which Mr.
Gompers	PERSON	and the
High Commissioners	ORGANIZATION	support , this statement as it is uttered by men who represent labor is sheer cant .

		And they may clear the statement of cant only as they carry with it a proposition which will do away with a market where labor is bargained for collectively according to trade-union practice , or where individually sold and purchased .

		But such a proposal would reecho the outdoor movement of the workers of
Europe	LOCATION	, and that we know is not the purpose of the
Peace Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		IVlR .

		WlLSON EITHER MEANT HIS FOURTEEN points honestly or he did not .

		He put them forward either as a holy cause for which his countrymen were to die , or else as a political , or rather moral , offensive in the same spirit in which
Colonel Robins	ORGANIZATION	sent Bolshevik propaganda into
Germany	LOCATION	.

		In any case he owes an answer to the American people , who com - mitted life and honor into his hands the more that his answer is bound to be theirs .

		Either he acted as decoy or he fell among thieves .

		It is a hard choice for vanity to make ; and it is the vanity of the whole nation which must be denied when the truth is spoken .

		In the litany which should be sung for all of us are the lines : Earth bears no balsam for mistakes ; Men crown the knave and scourge the tool That did his will but , thou , O Lord , Be merciful to me , a fool .

		5 * 4 THE DIAL
May 17	DATE	Communications CONCERNING THE DEFENSE OF '' SOVIET GOVERNMENT '' SIR : In your issue of
January 25	DATE	appeared an article under the title A Voice Out of
Russia	LOCATION	in de - fense of the Soviet Government .

		In illuminating the present events in
Russia	LOCATION	Mr.
Lomonossoff	PERSON	tries to show by comparing the Amer - ican people with the Russians that the reason for the success of Socialism in
Russia	LOCATION	-LRB- understand
Bolshev	PERSON	- ism -RRB- is the fact that the Russian peasants are com - munists while the American farmers are individual - ists .

		Thus he states : During that thousand years they -LSB- the Russians -RSB- grew accustomed to cultivating the land by communistic methods ... But the American farmer is first of all an owner , whereas the Russian peasant is a communist and here lies the reason for the success of socialistic teaching in
Russia	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Lomonossoff	PERSON	knows or should know that the Russian peasant does not cultivate his land by com - munistic but by individualistic methods ; that the Russian peasant of the
Commune	ORGANIZATION	considers himself the owner of the land which has been allotted to him and to his family by the village Mir , and that he is in reality the sole owner of that land at least up to the next redivision , which may come in twenty-five years or may not come at all .

		Mr.
Lomonossoff	PERSON	knows that this very faith in the communistic and socialistic ideals of the Russian peasants was the reason for the great revolutionary movement of the Russian Intelligentsia `` On to the people '' in the seventies of
last century	DATE	.

		He must be aware that the Russian Intelligentsia was greatly disappointed in its expectation of infusing Socialism in
Russia	LOCATION	with preliminary education and active propaganda among the masses , and that its hopes in the Mir and Commune were not realized .

		He surely must also know that the communal land tenure is far from being general in
Russia	LOCATION	, that it is very little known in the
Ukraine	LOCATION	, and that there were no signs of protests from the peasants when
Stolipin	PERSON	had dealt the Commune its death blow .

		In explaining the rise of the Soviets Mr.
Lomonos	PERSON	- soff says : '' The composition of the First Pro- visional Government was not in accordance with the sentiment of the country .

		And as a result , side by side with this
Government	ORGANIZATION	, sprang up the Soviets backed by the great masses of the people . ''

		As one of the participants in the work of the
Provisional Government	ORGANIZATION	at
Kiev	LOCATION	after the
March Revolution	ORGANIZATION	, as one elected by the
Kiev	LOCATION	Soviet of Workmen and Soldiers ' Delegates to the office of Military Com - mander of the
Kiev	LOCATION	district , and as a delegate to the
Copenhagen Conference	ORGANIZATION	sent by the Central Execu - tive Committee of the Peasants ' Soviets , I feel com - petent to assert that the Soviets did not
spring	DATE	up because the Provisional Government was not in ac - cordance with the sentiment of country , but because the Soviets were necessary , and for the following reason : After the
March Revolution	ORGANIZATION	- and the downfall of the Czarist regime the local authorities lost their heads .

		As there were no other democratic institu - tions which were trusted by the masses , the necessity arose , therefore , to create temporary revolutionary organs on more democratic lines than the former municipal
Dumas	PERSON	and Zemstvo institutions , the mem - bers of which were elected on property qualifications .

		Thus , in order to cooperate with the Provisional Revolutionary Governments , were created the Soviets of Workmen and Soldiers ' Delegates , and also the Peasants ' Soviets .

		These were then neces - sary , life itself brought them to the fore .

		True , it might seem strange to see soldiers -LRB- soldiers and of - ficers , of course -RRB- in the local political and economic organizations , for politics is not the business of the army , but the war had taken in all the healthy young men of the population , and it was quite natural that they should wish to participate in the whirlpool of the revolution .

		The
Provisional Government	ORGANIZATION	in the course of its ` constructive work promulgated universal suffrage , and thus in
August	DATE	and
September of 1917	DATE	all the municipal
Dumas	PERSON	and Zemstvo institutions were elected under the system of universal , equal , and secret suffrage .

		From the moment these truly democratic institutions began to function , the role , of the temporary revolutionary organs the Soviets was over , and they should have naturally given up their power .

		But now however started the struggle for power , the Bolsheviki agitators doing their utmost with the slogan '' All power to the Soviets . ''

		And wherever , after the
November	DATE	counter-revolution , the
Bolshe	LOCATION	- viki seized the power , they dispersed the
Dumas	PERSON	and the Zemstvos , and replaced them by Bolshevist Soviets .

		In addition I must say that even if these Soviets had been elected without pressure on the part of the
Bolsheviki	LOCATION	, even then they could not be considered as democratic institutions to replace the
Dumas	PERSON	and the Zemstvos , for the representation of the Soviets was accidental and the regularity of the elections was not guaranteed .

		Thus the Soviet `` rule even in case the elections were conducted without pressure or special selection is far from being genuinely democratic .

		Moreover , as Mr.
Lomonossoff	PERSON	well knows , the
Bolsheviki	PERSON	have excluded '' for the purpose of still greater democrati - zation '' from the
Central Executive Committee	ORGANIZATION	of the Soviets all Socialist Revolutionists and Social Democrats -LRB- Mensheviki -RRB- .

		This exclusion of non - Bolshevik elements is carried out in other localities .

		The Soviet Government at present does not even represent the workmen nor the peasants , but only the Bolsheviki or those who feign Bolshevism , and therefore Mr.
Lomonossoff	PERSON	's assertion that '' the Soviets and the
Bolsheviki	PERSON	are not one and the same '' is entirely false .

		I shall not stop to argue with Mr.
Lomonossoff	PERSON	regarding his lengthy criticism of the Provisional
1919	DATE	THE DIAL Government , but one point I can not pass in silence .

		He reproaches the Provisional Government for not having concluded a separate peace with
Germany	LOCATION	.

		At that time , he says , '' we still had an army , and the Germans would have paid us highly for a sep - arate peace . ''

		I wish to thank Mr.
Lomonossoff	PERSON	for this reproach .

		He says the
Provisional Government	ORGANIZATION	has not sold the honor of
Russia	LOCATION	to the German mili - tarists for the high price they offered , but the
Bolshe	PERSON	- viki whom he so ardently defends have done so .

		In order to retain at any cost the power they usurped they sold the honor of
Russia	LOCATION	at Brest-Litovsk .

		No , they did not succeed in selling the honor of
Russia	LOCATION	, but only the honor of the adventurers who in the name of
Russia	LOCATION	signed such a peace , for
Russia	LOCATION	as such did not recognize this peace .

		These same revolutionary adventurers the Bol - sheviki have torn to pieces our fatherland , and de - livered it to hunger , suffering , and torture for a long time to come .

		And such results of the domina - tion of the Bolsheviki and their hirelings are quite comprehensible in the light of
Lenin	ORGANIZATION	's remarks at the
Third Congress	ORGANIZATION	of Soviets .

		In estimating his comrades the Bolsheviki he said : '' To every hundred
Bolsheviki	PERSON	there is one idealist , thirty-nine criminals and sixty fools . ''

		Sapienti sat .

		C. OBEROUTCHEFF .

		PROFESSOR LOMONOSSOFF REPLIES .

		In the domain of facts General Oberutcheff re - futes two of my statements : -LRB- i -RRB- That the reason of the success of socialistic teaching in
Russia	LOCATION	lies in the fact of the existence of the land communes and '' artiels '' for a thousand years ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- That the Soviets and the
Bolsheviki	PERSON	are not one and the same , and that the Soviets were created simultaneously with the first Provisional Government and as a coun - ter-balance to same .

		Besides General Oberutcheff tells 1 us a new fact that
Lenin	PERSON	supposedly said at the
Third Congress	ORGANIZATION	of Soviets : '' To every - hundred Bolsheviki there is one idealist , thirty-nine criminals , and sixty fools . ''

		These facts I want to discuss .

		We shall begin with the first .

		General
Oberutcheff	PERSON	says : `` In illuminating the present events in
Russia	LOCATION	Mr.
Lomonossoff	PERSON	tries to show by comparing the Amer - ican people with the Russians that the reason for the success of Socialism in
Russia	LOCATION	-LRB- understand Bolshevism -RRB- is the fact that the Russian peasants are communists while the American farmers are individ - ualists . ''

		If we are to exclude General
Oberu	PERSON	- tcheff 's own insertion '' understand Bolshevism , '' my idea is conveyed quite accurately .

		But the trouble is that this insertion distorts my idea and gives the General the opportunity to make a series of accusa - tions , which accusations would otherwise not be pos - sible , if he quoted what I actually said .

		My words : '' The success of socialistic teaching in
Russia	LOCATION	... '' should be understood as what they meant to convey .

		I am speaking about that particular propaganda of the socialist Intelligentsia while the
General	ORGANIZATION	accuses me of not mentioning it .

		Among the propagandists were
Bolsheviki	PERSON	,
Mensheviki	LOCATION	, and Social Revolu - tionists .

		In the villages , with the exception of
Ukrainia	LOCATION	, the latter were most successful .

		Why then did the socialist teaching in general have in
Russia	LOCATION	a land industrially backward such an enormous success ?

		Just for the reason that the darkest masses of the people were historically ripe to absorb the socialistic ideas .

		It is exceptionally hard for me to explain this to General
Oberutcheff	PERSON	, who is himself a member of the
Social Revolutionary Party	ORGANIZATION	, which always explained this as the basis of their ideology .

		Furthermore , the
General	ORGANIZATION	says that within the Commune the peasant always remained an individ - ualist and '' that there were no signs of protests from the peasants when
Stolipin	PERSON	had dealt the Commune its death blow . ''

		Those who are interested in the history of the Russian commune I would refer to the classic works on this question Professor
Ebers	PERSON	'
Das Alteste Recht	PERSON	der Russen ,
1826	DATE	; Professor
Beliaeff	PERSON	's The Peasants in
Russia	LOCATION	,
1891	DATE	; and Professor
Kauff	PERSON	- man 's The Origin of the Russian Commune
1908	DATE	.

		But in this brief article I shall endeavor to explain what was exactly the Russian land commune before the war , and what is an `` artiel . ''

		Until
1907	DATE	, with the exception of those parts of
Ukrainia	LOCATION	which preserved the standard of the Polish land right , all the Russian peasantry owned the land on communistic basis .

		The land did not belong to any individual but was embodied in a commune be - longing to a whole village .

		The members of the commune had only the right to utilize their partic - ular plot which was allotted to them by the commune or by the mir for a definite length of time .

		The re - divisions of these lands regularly took place in
Siberia	LOCATION	every fifteen years ; in Zabaikals every five years , and throughout
Great Russia	LOCATION	every year .

		Within the limits of these periods the peasants tilled the alloted plots individually , but the pastures , forests and fishing waters were used by the commune as a whole .

		By the ukase of
November	DATE	ist ,
1907	DATE	-LRB- Stoli - pin 's reform -RRB- the peasants were given the privilege on certain conditions to buy their own plots of land .

		General
Oberutcheff	PERSON	says that this ukase was a death-blow to the commune and that the peasants did not protest .

		The facts are , however , as follows : The Czar 's regime had allotted credits only to the peasants who were willing to take advantage of the ukase of
November	DATE	ist .

		Before the war out of 135 millions Russian peasants only 19 millions became private landowners , and only six millions expressed their desire to do so -LRB- From the Russian Year Book ,
1916	DATE	, pages 176-177 -RRB- .

		In other words , under the pressure of the monarchy only 1 8 per cent of the Russian peasantry forsook the old traditions of the land-tilling masses .

		Another , not less ancient establishment of the Russian life is the '' artiel . ''

		The `` artiel '' is a free union for cooperative work .

		In
Russia	LOCATION	there are widely spread artiels of woodcutters , carpenters , diggers , and so on .

		Their capital is composed of THE DIAL
May 17	DATE	contributions of the members .

		The implements , provisioning , and sometimes even the clothing are communal .

		The earnings are divided proportion - ately to the contributions .

		Of laTe , the Russian word '' artiel '' has begun to disappear and is being replaced by the foreign word '' cooperative . ''

		Some differentiate these two conceptions and say that an artiel is a productive union , while the cooperative is the consuming union .

		Both are nevertheless an at - tempt at communal economy .

		The establishment of the Russian land commune , in accordance with Article 113 of the Provision of
February 19 , 1861	DATE	, was also , in spite of the opinion of General
Ober	PERSON	- utcheff , such an attempt .

		Speaking about the Soviets , I insist that they existed from the first day of the Revolution and were not , as the
General	ORGANIZATION	says , local organs for coopera - tion with the
Provisional Government	ORGANIZATION	, but a real power which overthrew the first and the second Provisional Governments .

		I remember perfectly well the conditions under which the Soviets came into existence , but I am afraid that the
General	ORGANIZATION	will doubt my testimony .

		Therefore I will quote the testimony of one of the chief workers of the
March Revolution	ORGANIZATION	, a member of the Duma Mr.
Boublikoff	PERSON	especially because he is an ideologist of capitalism and a bitter opponent of the Soviet Government .

		In his book entitled The Russian Revolution , published in
New York	LOCATION	in
1918	DATE	in Russian , he says : And nevertheless the revolution came welcomed by nobody and organized by nobody -LSB- page 15 -RSB- ... Later it was often said that the
Duma	ORGANIZATION	refused to dissolve .

		This is incorrect .

		The
Duma	ORGANIZATION	was not in session .

		The members of the
Duma	ORGANIZATION	, after receiving the
Ukase	ORGANIZATION	, assembled for a private conference -LSB- page 17 -RSB- ... At last it was decided to organize a '' Temporary Com - mittee for the Maintenance of Order and for
Communi	ORGANIZATION	- cation with Organizations and Individuals , '' consisting of twelve members of the
Duma	ORGANIZATION	-LSB- page 18 -RSB- ... A mob entered the Palace -LSB- the quarters of the
Duma	ORGANIZATION	-RSB- ... Having seized the
Duma	ORGANIZATION	quarters , the remnants of the revolutionary parties of
1905	DATE	quickly formed the Soviet of Workers ' and Soldiers ' Deputies , and this Soviet raised its head and voice hourly and was growing more insist - ent -LSB- page 25 . -RSB-

		-LSB- At the same time -RSB- the Soviet of Workers ' and Soldiers ' Deputies ... consistently worked for the formation of its branches throughout the land .

		In other words , it was getting ready to seize the power in the future -LSB- pages 40-41 -RSB- ... The Provisional Government ... at once put itself in an inferior and dependent relation to the Soviets -LSB- page 41 -RSB- , .

		.

		Many of the ministries were always running to the telephone to inquire of the opinion and the sentiment of the Soviet of Workers ' and Soldiers ' Deputies -LSB- page 48 -RSB- ... The resistance of Kerensky in
July	DATE	and
October	DATE	was not much more rigid than that of the Czar in
February	DATE	-LRB-
March	DATE	-RRB- -LSB- page 76 -RSB- ... Undoubtedly , much of what has been done by the Bolsheviki , could and should have been done by the
Provisional Government	ORGANIZATION	-LSB- page 81 -RSB- .

		In spite of the opinion of General
Oberutcheff	PERSON	, the establishment of the
All-Class Zemstvo	PERSON	did not shake the strength and the position of the Soviets , while the adventure of General
Korniloff	PERSON	only strengthened them .

		In
September , 1917	DATE	, the Soviets called a democratic
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and at that time it was quite clear that the
Kerensky Government	ORGANIZATION	was doomed .

		I do not dispute that in
August , 1918	DATE	, not all , but many , of the Social Revolutionists and Menshe - viki were expelled from the Soviets for the participa - tion and communication with the elements that in - vited foreign forces into
Russia	LOCATION	, and for the attempt to overthrow the Soviet Government .

		But let me ask what would the
American Senate	ORGANIZATION	do if foreign forces should invade the
United States	LOCATION	, attempting we will say to put up a monarch at the head of the
Government	ORGANIZATION	and if some of the Senators should help in such an adventure ?

		And , finally , in regard to the phrase attributed to Lenin that '' To every hundred Bolsheviki there is one idealist , thirty-nine criminals , and sixty fools , '' let me humbly call attention to the fact that I have in my possession the stenographic report of the
Third Congress	ORGANIZATION	of Soviets and that this report contains no such phrase .

		Nothing of the sort was heard by the Americans present at the
Third Congress	ORGANIZATION	by Messrs.
A. R. Williams	PERSON	and
G. Yarros	PERSON	.

		I do not know the source where trie General borrowed this phrase -LRB- he does not state it -RRB- , but I presume that he was made a victim of a joker .

		It is hardly possible to believe that
Lenin	PERSON	should say any such thing about his party , and still more it is absolutely impossible to believe that after such a remark he should remain at the head of it .


Chicago	LOCATION	.

		G. LOMONOSSOFF .

		POINT OF VIEW There is in the
March 29	DATE	issue of the Scientific American an article headed The Humanity of Poison Gas .

		The quotations below are taken from that article : So greatly have the horrors of gas attack been miti - gated since its first introduction that in the opinion of Brigadier-General
Amos A. Fries	PERSON	, who was in command of the
Chemical Warfare Service	ORGANIZATION	of our army at the front , it is possible that gas warfare may come to be recognized as a lawful method of warfare , and that it will not be eliminated .

		The argument as presented by him is also endorsed by
Colonel Walker	PERSON	, who is in com - mand of the
Edgewood	LOCATION	plant for the manufacture of gas ... If these facts are well established ... it becomes a question whether prudence and farsightedness do not suggest the maintenance of our great gas factory at
Edgewood Arsenal	LOCATION	.

		Possibly the Colonel and the Brigadier General are prejudiced somewhat by self interest in recom - mending the continuance of poison gas in warfare , and , by implication , of warfare itself .

		Possibly they did not lie half-blinded and half-suffocated in trenches charged with the breath of death , nor toss in vain search for relief from the agony of livid flesh that had been caressed with humane mustard gas .

		Have we not had enough of such arguments as these two warriors advance ?

		1919 THE DIAL 5 * 7 Notes on New Books IOLANTHE 'S WEDDING .

		By
Hermann Suder	PERSON	- mann .

		159 pages .


Boni & Liveright	ORGANIZATION	.

		Sudermann is an expert in handling the massive and unruly phenomena of passion : nearly all of his various works testify to his absorption in the sinister rather than the rapturously sentimental phases of love .

		Nietzsche 's caustic words '' but even your best love is only an enraptured parable and a painful .

		heat '' give the measure of Sudermann 's curiously tender and relentless cynicism , which seems always earnestly seeking genuine beauty in sex relations , but is invariably conpelled to find more of purgatory than of paradise .

		lolanthe 's Wedding -LRB- which is but the longest of four stories in this little volume -RRB- is a very grace - fully told story of an elderly nobleman and a beauti - ful girl whose betrothal to him was the result of parental intrigue rather than love .

		The nobleman himself tells us the story , beginning with the death of his best friend , his meeting with the parents of lolanthe , the girl herself , and his growing love for her a love he consistently makes fun of , in a wistful way .

		But his dead friend has a son ,
Lothar	PERSON	, and it develops , immediately after his marriage to lolanthe , that she and
Lothar	PERSON	have long been des - perately in love with each other and are considering a double suicide as the only .

		way out of an intoler - able situation .

		The old nobleman hides his pro- found adoration of lolanthe and keeps them both alive by getting divorced from the girl .

		The story ends with the old gentleman climbing into his beloved army cot and putting himself to sleep with an account of certain campaigns of the
Franco	LOCATION	- Prussian War .

		Presumably lolanthe and
Lothar	PERSON	- are married , but Sudermann spares us the corrosive solvent of his irony : for once in a way he will per - mit us to imagine a happy ending .

		The Woman Who Was His Friend , the second story , is a fragment of concentrated bitter - ness , presented in the form of a letter .

		The theme is the eternal incompatibility between friendship and love ; despite a rather sentimental tone the episode is forcefully told .

		The remaining two tales , New Year 's Confession , and The Goose Herd are linked to the others in subject-matter and treat - ment .

		One can thank
Adele Seltzer	ORGANIZATION	for very sympathetic translation .

		A GRAY DREAM .

		By
Laura Wolcott	PERSON	.

		288 pages .


Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	; New Haven .

		The method and the mood of sketches cling to all the contents of this volume , though part of it aspires to consideration as stories .

		But where the aim has been fiction , the effect is scarcely less sketchy than in the pieces plainly of that genre .

		All the things are tinted in the same soft shades , and there is the flavor of
New England	LOCATION	from cover to cover .

		`` The book 's value is perhaps chiefly in the flavor rather than in the material , for most of the glimpses of life are not different from what has been en - countered before in some guise .

		We are given pen pictures of village characters , tiny flashes of person - ality set down with sober sympathy .

		We review the even succession of events which are the warp and woof of unhorizoned lives , with now and then a glow of vital tragedy , and now and then a touch of homely comedy .

		A Gray Dream is a looking backward , through the eyes of a woman , upon '' the lengthening record of delectable days . ''

		The style is unpretentious , and its not infrequent felicities seem to rise out x of the author 's quiet harmony with the period of which she writes rather than from conscious literary striving .

		Not a book for a wide public , but one which will be welcomed by those whose lives beat in tune with the
New England	LOCATION	memories which it evokes .

		RUSSIA FROM THE VARANGIANS TO THE BOLSHEVIKS .

		By
Raymond Beazley	PERSON	,
Nevill Forbes	PERSON	, and
G. A. Birkett	PERSON	.

		601 pages .

		Ox -
ford University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		The presumptuous subtitle is justifiable only in so much as the book presents a kaleidoscopic cat - alogue of the more important events that took place in
Russia	LOCATION	between the ninth century and the abdica - tion of the last
Romanov	LOCATION	.

		Beyond this qualification , the work of the British professors scarcely meets the obvious need for a comprehensive interpretative ac - count of the history of
Russia	LOCATION	.

		The meritorious impartiality of the authors is quite evident ; but this merit becomes dubious when one finds their lack of bias tantamount to lack of point of view .

		More - over the triunity of the authorship is responsible for a lack of unity and uniformity in the structure of the book and in the transliteration of Slavonic names .

		Mr.
Beazley	PERSON	's Hedwig is rightly trans - formed by Mr.
Forbes	PERSON	into
Jadwiga	PERSON	, to cite a typical instance .

		Neither do the authors possess an equal sense of proportion .

		There are pages and pages of entertaining narrative relative to the semi-legendary period of Russian history -LRB- Book I -RRB- , whereas less than a page is given to the Decembrist uprising -LRB- Book III -RRB- .

		Were Mr.
Birkett	PERSON	guilty of critical vision , or at least of a point of view , he would not dismiss this uprising as '' a parody of the court revo - lutions of the eighteenth century . ''

		The Decem - brists struck the keynote of the revolutionary move - ments in
Russia	LOCATION	which culminated in the two revo - lutions of
1917	DATE	.

		The platform of
Colonel Pestel	ORGANIZATION	, the soul of the Decembrist movement , was virtually Bolshevist , advocating as it did a Federative Repub - lic , the abolition of class privileges , the nationaliza - tion of the land , and even a temporary dictatorship !

		The failure of the Decembrists to overthrow the Czar does not justify the contemptuous treatment allotted them by Mr.
Birkett	PERSON	; One of those dream - ers ,
Kahovskoy	PERSON	, shouted from the scaffold to his executioner : '' You 've caught the pike , but his teeth are at large . ''

		In the words of
Alexander Herzen	ORGANIZATION	, 518 THE DIAL
May 17	DATE	`` the cannon , the
Senate Square	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
1825	DATE	-RSB- aroused a whole generation . ''

		Thus the book on nineteenth century
Russia	LOCATION	starts out by overlooking the import - ance of an event which laid its stamp on all the succeeding movements of the Russian revolutionary forces .

		On the whole the third book is much weaker and thinner than the first two .

		The more recent the events the more journalistic appears their treat - ment .

		Again one is struck with the authors ' peculiar sense of proportion , when after a parsimoniously condensed account ` of the important events in the last fifteen years one comes in the concluding pages upon a verbatim reproduction of the abdication manifestoes of
Nicolas II	PERSON	and of his brother ,
Michael	PERSON	.

		One is tempted to suggest a reason for the superiority of the first two portions of the book : Messrs.
Beazley	PERSON	and
Forbes	PERSON	have made con - scientious use of the work of the great Russian his - torian , Kluchevsky .

		But
Kluchevsky	PERSON	's history does not reach the nineteenth century , and Mr.
Birkett	PERSON	, with his faculty for `` overlooking , '' has failed to consult the work of
Kluchevsky	ORGANIZATION	's follower ,
Kornilov	PERSON	, the author of a standard book on nineteenth century
Russia	LOCATION	.

		SHOPS AND HOUSES .

		By
Frank Swinnerton	PERSON	.

		320 pages .

		Doran .

		There is an old fallacy in Mr.
Swinnerton	PERSON	's in - teresting new novel a study of social life in a small community .

		He presents the hypothesis that society in such a community excludes the individual , cruelly represses him and belittles him ; whereas the society of a large city , in contrast , receives this same individual sympathetically and democratically .

		Surely that is not the true state of affairs .

		Exactly the same kind of conflict that takes place in
Beck	PERSON	- with takes place in
London	LOCATION	or any other large city when people try to break into a set which is not their own .

		The butler is prejudiced against the new chauffeur , and the duchess is antagonistic to the parvenu wholesale grocer .

		Moving to
London	LOCATION	only dodges the subject ; it does not solve it .

		Social climbers are everywhere alike petty , comtumelious , cruel . ''

		Are n't people , ''
Dorothy	PERSON	says , '' every - where alike ? ''

		In the social world , assuredly , they are very much alike .

		What
London	LOCATION	really does offer is not an escape from the social conflict but an escape from social life itself .

		In a city the in - dividual can live as an individual , comparatively independent of social relationships , free to indulge his individualistic predilections .

		In the development of his story , Mr.
Swinnerton	PERSON	swerves curiously from a realism , vigorous and au - thentic , to a romanticism that permits the employ - ment of the deus ex machina a wrecked delivery wagon and other interpolated impedimenta .

		As a result , the issues are worked out through the agency of accidents , chance , disease , and the like .

		It is strange that Mr.
Swinnerton	PERSON	, the realist , writes a scene like that of
The Concert	ORGANIZATION	, which might easily be a chapter in a

		This is a work of the utmost value .

		The Indian customs are rapidly vanishing ; the Indians them - selves prefer not to talk ; the buffalo hunts are over ; the war ceremonies have gone .

		This author how - ever has collected , arranged , and analyzed their songs with enthusiasm and patience .

		The difficul - ties were immense : Indian scales are different ; their intervals are different ; their rhythms are un - familiar , and often curiously complex .

		The drum and the voice , for example , often seem entirely in - dependent of each other .

		But the author is not exclusively interested in music ; that in fact is only the focus of the book .

		There are elaborate and sympathetic accounts of ceremonies , legends , phil - osophy , medicine , symbolisms , societies , games , and dances , illustrated by photographs and colored re - productions of the Indians ' own paintings .

		The translations of Indian poetry alone would justify the book 's existence .

		Musicians however should be especially interested in the rhythms , the curious method of building a melody by rhythmic phrases , and the non-tonal tunes .

		THE ENGLISH VILLAGE : A Literary Study , 1750-1850 .

		By
Julia Patton	PERSON	.

		236 pages .


Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dr.
Patton	PERSON	discusses the literature of the English village as a '' chapter in the social history of Eng - land . ''

		No purely literary study having regard to origins , relations , developments , types would have been feasible , for the literature of the village does not constitute a distinct genre .

		It is without unity of conception or a common form , and it was written in response to the most diverse influences .

		In the history of the
Romantic Movement	ORGANIZATION	, the emergence during the eighteenth century of the village theme is a mark of the growing democratic spirit ; it is also the expression of a sweeping social change .

		As the old-time village , with its unenclosed common , its self-sufficient isolation , its communal spirit , its rich traditions of an immemorial past , was about to disappear , it established itself in literature .

		Only within the last decade have the
Hammonds	PERSON	and others told the full story of the destruction during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries of the old village society .

		Many readers victims of the usual method of teaching literature as if it flourished in a vacuum must have felt a thrill at

May 17	DATE	the proof that The Deserted Village was not a '' beautiful piece of irrelevant pathos , '' but a true picture of what the great Enclosure movement was bringing about in
England	LOCATION	.

		It was clearly the op - portunity of the literary student to reexamine the old familiar village literature in the light of this new body of social fact .

		This Dr.
Fatten	PERSON	has done , with fine literary appreciation and keen social sense .

		That the result is in one way a little disappointing is not the author 's fault .

		Disinherited peasants , victims of an agrarian revolution more obscure but no less sweeping than
the Industrial Revolution	ORGANIZATION	, exiled laborers , villages sinking into poverty and crime what did literature do with this tragedy ?

		Typically , it looked backward to the village of the past , to
Auburn	ORGANIZATION	in its happier days .

		Dr.
Patton	PERSON	brings out the full social significance of
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	's stern realism and of
Burns	PERSON	' sturdy assertion of peasant independence ; she stresses all the scattered references to enclosure , to the grim '' House , '' to the unjust game laws ; and she notes the groping after causes .

		Yet from her study emerges the fact that literature lagged behind life . ''

		England 's peasant slave , the trodden down , the parish paid , in soul and body bowed , '' was not wholly neglected in the literature of the village .

		But this literature does little to break the force of the statement made by the

		If
Harry Leon Wilson	PERSON	has a genius for any - thing and it is within the range of possibility that he has it is most evident in the touch of burlesque with which he gives point to personality .

		Tricks of manner , quaintnesses of speech , strange quirks and eccentricities all of them humanly significant he catches aptly and repeats .

		Like the calcium man with his spotlight , he picks out dim figures on the darkened stage and throws them into a picturesque reality more real than life .

		But this genuine knack of Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's is at once his opportunity and his limitation .

		The cowmen , old
Safety First Cum	ORGANIZATION	- mins , the little guest from '' Grenitch '' Village ap - pear engagingly before us in the grease paint and full costume of their several roles , and speak their lines with conviction ; but it requires a deal of in - genuity on Mr.

		He has been so busy with their make-up that he has n't had time to give them minds .

		They have no inwardness , no urge to move in any particular direction , or in fact to move at all , so that Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	must needs shove them .

		But
Ma Pettengill	PERSON	, the stalwart ranchwoman who emerged , an upstanding figure , from

		Though she is made to recite a dozen or so undeniably '' made '' tales , she recounts them in so shrewdly humorous a fashion as to make them entirely delightful .

		The Library of French Fiction , edited by
Barnet J. Beyer	PERSON	, proposes to follow in the wake of the war and to make known to a sympathetic but non - French-reading
United States	LOCATION	the `` distinctive insti - tution ^ '' and `` unique social and intellectual life '' of
France	LOCATION	by means of a series of translations from contemporary French novels .

		A sense for the pic - turesque in landscape and customs whose exploi - tation was one of the marks of nineteenth century romanticism reinforced by the intense French at - tachment to the national soil , has produced a line of novels whose care for local color makes them so intensively interpretative of provincial life that they seem designed for instruction of the foreigner .

		Novels , like individuals , are of mixed ancestry ; but whatever the crosses with naturalistic schools in both
France	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	, such novels as Jacquou the Rebel and Nono derive directly from the provincial novels of George Sand .

		There is so little the ring of invention , so little even the air of reshaping , in
Jacquou	LOCATION	the Rebel that one is inclined to accept
Jacquou	PERSON	as a genuine local character whose story has become a part of the tra - dition of the countryside .

		The grasp of the forces that formed the character of the peasant rebel that is the contribution of the novelist 's sophistica - tion , certainly .

		But the murder of the villainous steward , the assault and razing of the chateau the tale of these must still persist among the descendents of witnesses . ''

		It seems , '' one of
Eugene Le Roy	PERSON	's French critics has said , `` that the author is absent while the book goes on quite by itself , unrolls of its own momentum . ''

		Treated in any other than this matter-of-fact way , such a story of peasant oppres - sion and misery would out-Dickens
Dickens	PERSON	for pathos .

		The novel is told as the direct recital of the hero , and perhaps the only sign of strain is exactly the details of local superstition , habit , and history .

		Nono 's story is less outwardly striking and more complex .

		The reader gets at it by layers .

		There are first fragments of Nono 's tavern ac - counts baited by his fellow-habitues of the mar - riage of his youth ; gradually these fragments fall to - gether into a connected narrative , and finally we are at the heart of an idyl of the vineyards
Nono	PERSON	's love for the sweetheart of his childhood , a love that overlooks her violation by

Meriel Buchanan	PERSON	.

		242 pages .

		Scribner .

		Who is the author ?

		and what were his opportuni - ties for observing the Russian Revolution ?

		These are questions the wise '' reader asks concerning each new book on
Russia	LOCATION	.

		To ignore the political or class bias of the competent eye-witness is scarcely less foolish than to swallow every traveler 's tale .

		Both Mr.
Stebbing	PERSON	and
Miss Buchanan	PERSON	lived through the Kerensky regime in
Petrograd	LOCATION	;
Miss Buchanan	LOCATION	was also resident there during the last years of the Czar 's power .

		Both are of the British privileged class :
Miss Buchanan	PERSON	is the daughter of the British ambassador ; Mr.
Stebbing	PERSON	was for many years an official in the Anglo-Indian service .

		Their point of view is that of the privileged class .

		The - opinions they quote are largely those of members of the privileged class in
Russia	LOCATION	: bankers , generals , of - iicials , and diplomats of the old regime , industrial magnates , leaders of the more conservative political groups .

		To both observers the faces of the revolu - tionary soldiers and workmen are sullen , obstinate , dull , brazen , furtive , or evil-looking . ''

		Scalawags , '' '' ruffians , '' '' brutes '' are the favorite epithets .

		No conversations with these workmen , soldiers , and sail - ors are recorded .

		The tragedy of
Russia	LOCATION	reveals itself in the slouch of a sentry , the failure to salute an officer , the entry of privates into a first-class restaurant car .

		When the ' soldier in the hospital suffered with patient , uncomplaining , unquestioning resignation ; when the masses knelt , weeping , cheer - ing , and singing , as the Czar passed by on his way to the cathedral then Miss
Buchanan	PERSON	loved and pitied the simple-hearted Russian .

		Later , her pity is for the poor , bewildered , old-fashioned soldier who no longer has a Little Father to die for ; for the old white-bearded general in fur hat and scarlet-lined cloak , who is pitifully grateful for the unexpected salute of an English officer ; for the upper-class women whose relatives lost their lives and whose estates were plundered during the agrarian troubles .

		Her admiration is for the fierce , well-disciplined Cossacks who ride down the
Kronstadt	LOCATION	sailors , and for the faithful though cruel police who stuck to their posts to the end , firing with their machine guns upon the people .

		Mr.
Stebbing	PERSON	's hero is
Kornilov	LOCATION	, and his hope is for the appearance of the '' strong man . ''

		Both muse , in empty churches or in the halls of the
Winter Palace	ORGANIZATION	, upon the majesty of the old faith , or on the scenes of splendor when those halls were thronged with the noblest and love - liest and greatest of the Empire .

		Miss
Buchanan	PERSON	hears the savage laugh of a workman in the desolate city of
Peter the Great	PERSON	, once the scene of golden pomp and revelry and of Bloody
Sunday	DATE	mas - sacres .

		Mr.
Stebbing	PERSON	quotes with no mark of disap - proval the opinion of an old regime official that , until the new generation is educated , the only way to rule is with the whip .

		For , bad as the old regime was , it maintained order , protected property , and made the law respected .

		In short , it had '' dignity and distinction . ''

		Although the two writers record the same events , they emphasize different aspects .

		Mr.
Stebbing	PERSON	is most concerned with the military situation on the various Russian fronts , and with the political changes in the capital as they affect the army 's operations .

		His diary is full of political gossip , significant and trivial , of extracts from interminable speeches , and of reports from the army .

		Miss
Buchanan	PERSON	is an artist .

		She selects with a sure in - stinct the picturesque scenes , the dramatic incidents , of the court , the street , and the hospital .

		She has a rare feeling for the beauty of sunset , of shadows , of opal or copper tinted waters , of gilded domes and slender spires , golden bells , blue seas , snowy forests , and dusky churches ... It is a pity she saw no beauty in the crimson banners of the Revolution they were always '' grimy , '' or '' dusty , '' or '' limp '' and felt no thrill at the new light in the eyes of those whose unquestioning resignation had endured too long .

		Problems of Peace : From the
Holy Alliance	ORGANIZATION	to the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	, by
Guglielmo Ferrero	PERSON	-LRB- 281 pages ;
Putnam	LOCATION	-RRB- , is a summary and running comment on the history of
Europe	LOCATION	from
1815	DATE	.

		Mr.
Ferrero	PERSON	finds that the chief problem of peace during the nineteenth century was the opposition between divine right and popular sovereignty as principles of rule .

		The only problem of peace that he sees in the present is the complete satisfaction of the claims of
Italy	LOCATION	to compensate for her unparalleled chivalry in rush - ing to the aid of the Allies and her surpassing losses on their behalf .

		Mexico Under
Carranza	PERSON	, by
Thomas E. Gibbon	PERSON	-LRB- 270 pages ;
Doubleday	ORGANIZATION	, Page -RRB- , betrays its animus in its sub-title : '' A Lawyer 's Indictment ^ of the Crowning Infamy of Four Hundred Years of Misrule . ''

		It is a piece of special pleading leading to the familiar conclusion that intervention is the only solution .

		The
I. W. W.	PERSON	: A Study of
American Syndicalism	ORGANIZATION	, by
Paul Frederick Brissenden	PERSON	-LRB-
Columbia University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , wisely treats the
I. W. W.	PERSON	neither as a philosophy nor as a contribution to pure theory , but presents a comprehensive and impartial historical account of the organization as a militant tactic from its inception to date .

		The book contains excerpts from the
I. W. W.	PERSON	Song Book and a valuable bibli - ography .

		Old Saws and Modern Instances , by
W. L. Courtney	PERSON	-LRB- 269 pages ;
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , is a new collection of essays by the editor of The Fortnightly . ''

		An inquiry into the conditions and limitations of Dramatic Realism is perhaps the most substantive of my aims in this book , which also includes some purely historical es - says . ''

		The three essays on Dramatic Realism are accompanied by two on The Idea of Comedy , which supplement his admirable book The Idea of Tragedy -LRB-
1900	DATE	-RRB- , and by discussions of
Hardy	LOCATION	and
Aeschy	PERSON	- lus ;
Aristophanes	LOCATION	, the Pacifist ; Patriotism and Ora - tory -LRB- with reference to
Demosthenes	LOCATION	,
Lincoln	LOCATION	, and
Venizelos	PERSON	-RRB- ; Sappho and
Aspasia	LOCATION	;
Marcus Aurelius	PERSON	; Brieux as a Moralist ; the '' human '' '' Euripides ; and Sir
Herbert Tree	PERSON	and the English Stage .

		A book rich with the seasoned thought of a scholar who is equally at home in the ancient and the modern ; worlds .

		The Moon of the Caribbees , by
Eugene O'Neill	PERSON	-LRB- 2M pages ;
Boni & Liveright	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , includes Six Other Plays of the Sea : Bound East for
Cardiff	ORGANIZATION	, The Long Voyage Home , In the Zone , He , Where the Cross is Made , and The Rope .

		The atmosphere that on the stage saturates these brief dramatic studies persists in the printed plays and carries them successfully through not a little ' halting action and commonplace motiva - tion .

		Picture , dialect , and mood contribute more to this magic than do the characters , who are often sentimentalized , or the events , which may be quite melodramatic .

		Travelling Companions , by
Henry James ^	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- 309 pages ;
Boni & Liveright	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , contains seven stories , published between
1870	DATE	and
1874	DATE	, of the type made familiar by the collections in The Passionate Pilgrim and in A Bundle of Letters .

		The material of most of them Ts the rather thin cosmopolitanism of
James	PERSON	' early years .

		The pallid characters and self-conscious style are pleasantly reminiscent of the affectations of that in - teresting period .

		The Toys of Peace , by
H. H. Munro	PERSON	-LRB- illustrated ; 303 pages ; Lane -RRB- , is made up of some thirty very brief humorous sketches of pre-wartime
England	LOCATION	, done with such lightness of touch and complete spontaneity as to make their nonsense most infectious .

		1919 THE DIAL 525 a flaming romance of rebellion The
I. W. W.	PERSON	has been one of the flaming romances of our American life ; an uncon - querable rebellion ; a human frontier of petu - lant , primitive insurrection .

		One may hate the
I. W. W.	PERSON	one may fear its power .

		One must nevertheless admit that it is a dramatic , scarlet color , splashed over the canvas of our national life .

		Always heretofore it has been a mystery , uninterpreted and unexplained .

		All that one could read , if his curiosity were kindled , was the dry and wheezy economic pamphlets of propaganda .

		But at last the revolution has raised up a man who has put this story of passion into literature .

		The drama and the dreams the passions and the regenerations the triumphs and the tragedies all the whirling pageantry of labor 's rebellion find voice in
Harold Lord Varney	PERSON	's '' Revolt . ''

		This novel is a burst of breathless incidents , warmed with a rich tale of friendship , and an exotic , flaming climax of woman 's love .

		To
Varney	PERSON	the
I. W. W.	PERSON	is a veritable
Arden of Romance	ORGANIZATION	.

The City of Comrades	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- .

		And one divines that the author himself is speaking .

		Dis - honesty of workmanship is also the fault of Mr.
King	PERSON	's story .

		He does not face his problems squarely .

		When his hero , rescued from dipsomania by the efforts of the Down and
Out Club	ORGANIZATION	, is rebuffed by the heroine on account of his past misdeeds in other words when an apparent impasse has been reached the author discovers that the Archduke Ferdinand must have been murdered about this time , and ships
Frank Melbury	PERSON	off to the wars .

		When he returns , a Canadian major with a fash - ionable limp , affairs have of course altered .

		In due time the wars , by disposing of
Melbury 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		rival , save the heroine from her impasse as well .

		In Victorious -LRB- Bobbs-Merrill ;
Indianapolis	LOCATION	-RRB-
Reginald Wright Kauffman	PERSON	tries to invest the same national characteristic exemplified in this case by army contractors with an epic quality .

		He at - tempts much more than Mr.
King	PERSON	; he fails more signally and for similar reasons .

		On his canvas he includes the whole of
America	LOCATION	at war : the country towns in
1917	DATE	; the debarkation camps ;
Paris	LOCATION	; the American front .

		He knits the story together with recurrent references to munition frauds and bureau - cratic inefficiency .

		At times he rises to a noble anger , but he accomplishes little in the end , for he mingles the inevitability of tragedy with the shoddy of circumstance .

		Moreover the motto of the eternal journalist '' Cherchez la femme , '' or in plain American , '' Go heavy on the sex stuff '' interferes constantly with his larger purposes .

		It is a journalistic view of the war , again , that ruins The American -LRB- Century -RRB- .

		In this case the journalism is sentimental and reeks of the press office of the
Y. M. C. A. Mary Dillon	PERSON	's novel shows in addition the futility of the old situations the romantic triangle , for example against the background of a world in arms .

		When chance places the rival suitors of her novel in the same company , one is willing to give some credence to the story , for such things do happen , even if only once in ten thousand times .

		But when the heroine takes up nurs ` ing and happens to be assigned to their sector of the front , one begins to doubt .

		War , after all , is the great separator , not the great assembler , of friends .

		Confronted by the same situation as the others ,
J. C. Snaith	ORGANIZATION	acquits himself with more polish but with little more understanding .

		In The Undefeated -LRB-
Appleton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- he skimps on realities just as she does , and emphasizes the obvious .

		At the beginning of the book his characters are either weakly good or strong and wicked ; after a hundred pages , and the declaration of war , they become paragons of both strength and virtue .

		All of these books deal with the European strug - gle ; in all of them it is the pleasant , the heroic side of war that the authors choose to stress .

		Entirely absent from their picture is the uncompromising truthfulness of
Siegfried Sassoon	PERSON	and his indignation at the system that lets war come to pass : You smug-faced crowds with kindling eye Who cheer when soldier lads march by , Sneak home and pray you never know The hell where youth and laughter go .

		The crowd will never know if they depend on these authors .

		These will never draw aside the veiL Their account of the war is fuller , more studied , but no more true and no more vivid than that of the average newspaper .


John Finley	PERSON	's A Pilgrim in Palestine -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is the product of a conscientious effort to recount each step of the journey on foot through Palestine as the '' first American pilgrim '' after its recovery by
General Allenby	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Finley	PERSON	, a sincere and earnest pilgrim through holy places , is genuinely impressed , is awed into a delightfully solemn and reverent mood and rendered inarticulate .

		Now and again he turns for self-expression to mediocre verse and returns , frustrate .

		In less '' memora - ble '' matters in his chapter on the personal quali - ties of General

WILSON	PERSON	.

		JL \ , NATION that can not keep its promises is weak .

		A nation that will not keep its promises is faithless .

		Within the next few weeks the American people must choose either to admit their helplessness or sanction their betrayal .

		In entering the war we pledged ourselves to create a new international order .

		Our aim was nothing less than to make the world '' safe for democracy . ''

		Spurred by our magnanimous state - ment of purposes the peoples of
Europe	LOCATION	, weary of the riot and carnage and death , stiffened their backs to bear a little while longer the burden of the war .

		Nearly three hundred thousand American soldiers sealed the pledge of honor with their blood .

		Mil - lions more stood ready to make the sacrifice .

		The arrangements effected by the Peace Confer - ence are a mockery of our democratic faith and our idealistic promises .

		We are offered a '' peace '' which only further warfare can keep intact . '

		The
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	has become a bond exacted by usurers .

		Not for such a pact did the American people pledge their lives and their fortunes .

		We sought a '' league of honor . ''

		We can not satisfy ourselves with the sort of honor that is found among thieves .

		To accept the present treaty and covenant would betray the dead .

		It would sell the common people of the world into the slavery of perpetual militarism .

		It would smirch the honor and blacken the historical character of the Ameri - can people . ''

		The ultimate peace of the world and the libera - tion of its peoples '' still remain to be achieved .

		The Treaty and
Covenant	ORGANIZATION	block the path to a new order .

		Hence THE DIAL rejects the Treaty and demands an honest Covenant .

		Unless the
Ameri	LOCATION	- can people have the moral honesty and the political force to back up this demand , their promises are flouted , their hopes are betrayed , and their pledges annulled .

		Now is the time for a lineup .

		On one side submission , reaction , chaos , and warfare without end .

		On the other .

		resistance , progress , order , and the foundations of a genuine peace .

		THE DIAL has frankly indicated the ground upon which it stands .

		It believes that the American people must - '' hold their purpose and their honor steady to a common end , '' and that they can not boast them - selves a iree nation unless they are able to keep the faith they have plighted .

		Holding that democracy itself is at stake , THE DIAL appeals boldly for popular moral support .

		The daily press is , venal .

		The national legislature is subservient .

		The liberal journals must serve .

		Will you help us keep the faith ?

		The govern - ment has failed .

		The American people must finish the job .

		534 THE DIAL
May 31	DATE	The Real Sem Benelli IN
ITALY	LOCATION	DURING THE YEARS before the war one heard much of the rising fame of
Sem Benelli	LOCATION	.

		He was a Tuscan , born at
Prato	LOCATION	almost a Florentine .

		While yet in his twenties he was the author of a great theatrical success , La Cena delle Beffe , as well as of several plays upon which the popular verdict was more doubtful .

		He had found a new mode of Italian dramatic poetry , a dolce stil nuovo .

		In the general opinion
Italy	LOCATION	had given to this genera - tion a second romantic and poetic dramatist worthy to stand beside
D'Annunzio	PERSON	and
Rostand	PERSON	.

		But before the name and plays of
Sem Benelli	PERSON	reached our shores the war intervened ; and only now , ten years after its brilliant premiere at the Teatro dell ' -
Argentina	LOCATION	, comes La Cena in its American form of The Jest to Mr.
Hopkins	PERSON	' theater as a '' vehicle '' for the talents of the
Brothers Barrymore	ORGANIZATION	.

		It must be said at once that the play has suffered a sea-change .

		La Cena delle Beffe is in the origi - nal a historical play of character and atmosphere .

		D'Annunzio 's
Francesca da Rimini	LOCATION	is its rival a play which diffuses from the old story immortalized by Dante the very mood of the Middle Age , the spirit in which the Malatesti and Polentani played their desperate match in
Ravenna	LOCATION	and
Rimini	LOCATION	, as the
Baglioni	LOCATION	at
Perugia	LOCATION	or the
Estensi	LOCATION	at
Ferrara	PERSON	a mood of threatening gloom as of
winter	DATE	, a spirit of fierce concentration upon self-preservation and aggrandizement relieved at moments by the tender dawn of youth and
spring	DATE	, by a flash of matchless beauty , a song of infinite sweetness , which leads the lovers back again into the '' lightless night of night . ''

		La
Cena delle Beffe	ORGANIZATION	is of a period later by two centuries , the noon of high Renaissance , in the
Florence	LOCATION	of the magnificent
Lorenzo	PERSON	, the home of artists and of artists in life , of men who still played with the same counters of love and death , but in sport , seeking sources of new sensation in subtle compounds of pleasure and fear , finding expression for their artistic endeavor in giving to human ex - perience strange , grotesque , and yet symmetrically exact forms ; a period when they had learned to act more lightly , to dare more negligently , to bear themselves more gracefully , to pluck the exquisite moments of life more casually , to parody the great struggle for the survival of the fittest with a jest , a beffa , and to make the jest a work of subtly con - trived art .

		Much of this atmosphere is lost in the American adaptation .

		The Barrymores or their adapter have chosen to see in the play a melodrama , and they have naturally fallen into the great tradi - tion of English melodrama the late Elizabethan .

		The story might be one out of
Boccaccio	LOCATION	, and its treatment is reminiscent of the way in which the Elizabethans used that storehouse of dramatic ma - terial with this difference , that no decadent fol - lower of Shakespeare would have chosen this story at all .

		To the Italians of the Renaissance the practical joke was a test of human power and of that adroitness which they prized above strength , of that compound of human forces which they called virtu .

		To the English mind it is but a piece of ingenuity aided by circumstance , clever but hardly worth telling .

		Thus in the
Barry	LOCATION	- mores ' version we have the effect of an Elizabethan tragedy ,
Middleton	PERSON	's Changeling or
Ford	ORGANIZATION	's 'T is Pity She 's a Whore , but with the difference that whereas the English plays have a basis of genuine passion to sustain them , the Italian lacks that raison d'etre .

		Its suffering seems gratuitous , invented .

		In other words , it is melodramic .


Giannetto Malespini	PERSON	has suffered long humilia - tion at the hands of two brothers ,
Neri	PERSON	and Ga - briello Chiaramantesi , bullies from
Pisa	LOCATION	.

		Neri has stolen
Giannetto	PERSON	's lady-love Ginevra , and the two have beaten and nearly drowned him .

		Giannetto has engaged his friend Tornaquinci to give a supper to which he invites his enemies .

		Here at the out - set the adaptation goes wrong .

		There is no authorization , except
John Barrymore	PERSON	's prejudice , for making Giannetto but eighteen years old , and the story of persecution on his way to v school by the older boys , who compel him to eat twelve blue - bottle flies , however true to American life , does not belong to the play .

		Equally baseless is the ac - count of the grotesque terture inflicted on Gian - netto by the brothers , which is _ the immediate oc - casion of his revenge his trussing up on a barrel and the decoration of his hinder parts with pic - tures drawn in blood with a knife .

		The possible reason for this addition seems to be to strengthen the - motivation ; the adapter does not trust to the Renaissance concept of a jest and fears that his audience will find the play - top-heavy with its terrific structure of revenge built upon so slight a foundation .

		The same reason doubtless explains the metamorphosis of Ginevra from mistress to fiancee though her description as daughter of a fishmonger seems entirely gratuitous , perhaps a reminiscence of Hamlet .

		Giannetto begins his revenge by pitying Ga - briello for his hopeless love of Ginevra , and on
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 535 that suggestion the younger brother departs .

		He then challenges
Neri	PERSON	to go to the shop of Ceccherino in armor and bearing a sword .

		As
Neri	PERSON	departs he sends word to the bravi at the fencing-school that
Neri	PERSON	is mad and must be seized and to
Lorenzo	LOCATION	that the berfa has begun , and that it will be per - fidious and beautiful .

		In the next act Ginevra emerges from her cham - ber to hear from a messenger how
Neri	PERSON	has gone mad and is in bonds she is astonished , for is not
Neri	PERSON	within ?

		No , it is Giannetto who comes forth a thief of love trembling between desire and fear .

		Here again the American adaptation refines upon the original , for
Giannetto	ORGANIZATION	makes it clear that there has been nothing between them less innocent than sleep .

		Was not Ginevra his fiancee ?

		But this change makes his scene with
Neri	PERSON	-LRB- who appears but is again captured -RRB- one of pure boasting .

		Act III is in
Neri	LOCATION	's prison .

		He is tested by the appearance of those who hate him , women whom he has betrayed .

		One of them ,
Lisabetta	LOCATION	, really loves
Neri	PERSON	and tells a falsehood in order to be brought to ` him among the others .

		She counsels him to feign actual madness so that
Giannetto	PERSON	may free him , and then asks that he be given into her custody .

		Giannetto is terribly afraid , but he savors his fear like a rare fruit or wine and he is mad to play out his befra to the end .

		He sets Neri free : I shall be -LSB- he says -RSB- this evening at
Ginevra	ORGANIZATION	's house at the usual hour .

		If you come , you kill me .

		I shall be there !

		You know how danger is my bread and my wine .

		My legs tremble when I reflect , but I shall be there .

		If you are mad you will not come ; if you are not , I find my death .

		Act IV is brief as a spasm of passion or of death .

		It is again at the house of
Ginevra	LOCATION	.

		Neri forces her to receive
Giannetto	PERSON	, meaning to kill him in her arms .

		Trembling with horror she agrees .

		Into the night of fear comes a single star the song of a boy who loves
Ginevra	ORGANIZATION	and sings under her win - dow his song of
May	DATE	.

		A man enters wearing the mantle of flame color which Giannetto has worn in Act I .

		He goes in to
Ginevra	LOCATION	.

		Higher and higher rises the boy 's song of
May	DATE	into the sky black with murder .

		There is a double cry of man and woman .

		Neri emerges with his bloody dag - ger in his fist in the American version , a blood - stained white mantle to be confronted by the pallid face of
Giannetto	LOCATION	, trembling in the joy of his completed vengeance .

		It was Gabriello , whom love of
Ginevra	LOCATION	, planted by
Giannetto	ORGANIZATION	's hate , has lured to death and
Neri	ORGANIZATION	is indeed mad .

		In the acting , likewise , the Barrymores have fallen back on the Elizabethan tradition .


John Barry	PERSON	- more , who has somehow grasped the fact that his part is one of superheated intelligence , adopts the pose of Hamlet , though his appearance is rather that of Osric .

		Lionel Barrymore , as
Neri	ORGANIZATION	, carries off the first act with bluff bravado , a compound of Falstaff and the Ancient Pistol .

		In one moment indeed he raises the play from melodrama to pure tragedy , when in Act III Jie stands chained to his pillar , his head bowed , his face hidden , his body in - ert and broken .

		Even Miss
Maud Durand	PERSON	-LRB- who is excellent -RRB- as
Ginevra	ORGANIZATION	's servant has reminiscences of Juliet 's nurse .

		The real triumph of presenta - tion , as has been generally agreed , is that of the set - tings by Mr.
Robert Edmond Jones	PERSON	.

		They restore to the play in a measure that of which adaptation and interpretation have deprived it the atmosphere of its period .

		La
Cena delle Beffe	ORGANIZATION	is , in its true form , a great play because it is the perfect representation of char - acter in action although the action is but a jest .

		Benelli 's preoccupation with this chief of dramatic problems , the relation of action to character , can scarcely be understood without reference to his other plays , particularly the one which preceded La Cena and which might be called its antitype .

		In The Mask of Brutus -LRB- La Maschera di Bruto , first acted at the
Teatro Lirico	LOCATION	,
Milan	LOCATION	, in
May 1908	DATE	-RRB- he chose for his action not a jest , but one of the famous events of history , one of those deeds which like the exploit of
Judith	PERSON	or the death of
Samson	PERSON	or the temptation of Herod have fascinated the race by its drawing together of human forces into one moment of overwhelming action .


Benelli	PERSON	's action is that of Lorenzino dei Medici - -LRB- Lorenzaccio -RRB- , who murdered his bastard cousin
Alessandro	PERSON	, tyrant of
Florence	LOCATION	by grace of the Emperor
Charles V	PERSON	, and first holder of the hated title of
Grand Duke of Tuscany	LOCATION	.

		Lorenzino has always been a baffling figure , incarnating within himself the worst vices and weaknesses of rotting
Italy	LOCATION	, and yet strangely capable of a deed that reminded men of
Cesare Borgia	ORGANIZATION	, and made them wonder for a moment if that great active spirit had not returned to earth to bring back the glories of the days when the Renaissance was action , and human character was human force .

		This personality of
Loren	PERSON	- zino was
Benelli	PERSON	's chief attraction to the story .

		He loves his aunt Caterina with that mixture of feeling , filial , fraternal , passionate , which fasci - nated the Renaissance with its suggestion of being beyond human sin ; and twisted into this theme is his love of
Florence	LOCATION	.

		The Grand Duke also de - sires
Caterina	ORGANIZATION	and Lorenzino stabs him .

		Then fleeing he is hailed by the Florentine exiles as
Brutus	LOCATION	, and the mask once assumed he can never put it off .

		At the court of
Francis	PERSON	I of
France	LOCATION	, where he is an exile ,
Marguerite of Navarre	ORGANIZATION	, with the novelist 's instinct , pursues him .

		Is he really 53 6 THE DIAL
May 31	DATE	sincere ?

		`` As falsehood , '' cries
Lorenzino	PERSON	.

		At last at
Venice	LOCATION	, he confesses , and dies by the hands of
Cosimo	ORGANIZATION	's assassins .

		In
Lorenzino Benelli	PERSON	has presented a character in which the late Renaissance delighted , a man played upon by conflicting passions , love of country , love of woman , love of fame themselves capable of assuming strange perverse forms a personality with motives which bear no fruit in deeds , and deeds which have no honorable parentage .

		He has given us a drama about a bastard act , written with the eloquence of deceit .

		The truth of the play is its falsehood . ''

		My drama respects his mask , '' says
Benelli	PERSON	, '' that which is most significant and most beautiful in him ... Art is also a game . ''

		Of
Benelli	PERSON	's other plays The Love of the
Three Kings	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- L'Amore dei Tre Re -RRB- is known in Amer - ica as the libretto of Montemezzis ' opera .

		It takes us back into an earlier age , forty years after the con - quest of
Italy	LOCATION	by the
Lombards	LOCATION	, the twilight of the world the period of
D'Annunzio	PERSON	's
La Nave	ORGANIZATION	.

		The blind old Lombard king Archibaldo recalls the con - quest : This goddess , rising between two seas , seemed to us solitary , with none to defend her alone , unguarded , virgin , who to the panting desire of us barbarians in - clined her head , timid , shrouded in melancholy .

		But her members , hardly touched ' , awoke a morbid languor which diffuses itself through us all .

		And here with her we sit , and lie , and love , and never one of us will leave her , this new mistress , all fresh , green , golden and loving her we weep that she is our slave , not our mother , because if she were our mother she would teach us to conquer the world .

		The play is a swift tragedy .

		The son of
Archi	LOCATION	- baldo ,
Manfedo	LOCATION	, has married Fiora , of an ancient Italian family .

		Her former betrothed ,
Avito	LOCATION	, re - turns and she loves him .

		The old king 's blindness , which prevents him from seeing and avenging the dishonor of his house , is a touch of tragedy like the presence of the blind wife in
D'Annunzio	PERSON	's La Citta Morta .

		Fiora wavers between love of Avito and returning passion for Manfedo .

		She is strangled by the old king , and her lovers die of the poison with which he has anointed her lips .

		It is the allegory of
Italy	LOCATION	'' the woman country , woo'ed not wed , by earth 's male lands '' and her hesitating betrayal of her future with her past .

		In II Mantellaccio ,
1913	DATE	, to choose one more of
Benelli	PERSON	's plays , he comes again to the
Renais	PERSON	- sance to the seventeenth century , when the cul - ture of
Italy	LOCATION	had stiffened into pedantry and her poetic genius had become an affair of learned clubs and academies .

		The drama opens at the session of the
Accademia degli Intemerati	LOCATION	, that is the In - violate .

		The members are trying their verses on each other .

		Meanwhile outside the sacred portals the
Carnival	ORGANIZATION	is on .

		A group of ladies enter , masked as precious stones .

		They will assist at the session and reward with a suitable prize the poet who triumphs .

		But outside rises higher the song of the revellers : Enjoy with gladness For tomorrow comes sadness .

		Christ forsakes never Him who sins with ardor .

		He pardons ever Who repents with fervor .

		For clearly the heart Which forgiveness would win Must know well the wisdom : 'T is human to sin .

		There is tumult about the door and the revellers rush in .

		They are the company of the Man - tellaccio of the cloak a singing company , men of the people , poets as well , who have forced the doors of the Inviolate to let in a little fresh air .

		It is agreed that they shall be admitted to the con - test , and the leader of the masks , the Emerald , promises to show her face to the victor as prize .

		L'Ardente begins a canzone in the Petrarchan manner , but the lady is bored .

		Then the
Novice	ORGANIZATION	sings for the Mantellaccio , a song as different from L'Ardente 's as
Walther	PERSON	's from
Beckmesser 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
Novice	ORGANIZATION	has won .

		Later he visits the Emerald and tells her how his father was poet , a strolling singer ; how he grew up , a poet of nature ; how love of her makes him more than ever poet .

		He leaves her , followed by L'Ardente , who forces him to a duel and wounds him mortally , as the Emerald comes , bring - ing too late the love that would have saved him .

		The question which has been raised in regard to the verse of The Jest in English , calls attention to the new dramatic medium which
Sem Benelli	ORGANIZATION	has created .

		He has taken the Italian endecasyllabic line the established measure of the Italian poetic drama as the Alexandrine is of French and has used the permissible freedom of dividing it ac ; cording to the meaning of the speaker , and varying the value of syllables according to the natural rhythm of his speech , thus obtaining a freedom that is comparable to that achieved by Shakespeare in his later plays , and by the dramatists who followed him , making of the rigid blank verse a kind of colloquial poetry .

		In other words ,
Benelli	PERSON	has imposed upon the established line of the Italian blank verse the larger rhythms and countless contra - puntal effects of prose .

		Italian critics regard these innovations as re-creative .

		It is easy for even a foreign reader to feel how smooth , plastic , undulat - ing , and harmonious is
Benelli	PERSON	's verse ; how natur - ally it accommodates itself to the staccato effect of his comic speech and the sonorous majesty of his tragic utterance above all how the strain of fol - lowing the thoughts of men in a medium in which
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 537 they do not think is abolished .

		We can conceive of
Benelli	PERSON	's characters thinking in such verse as his .

		Another Elizabethan characteristic of
Benelli	PERSON	is his feeling for the word .

		We have come to rec - ognize the dramatic value of language itself the difference between a play written in the vital speech , even if it be slang , of actual life , and one written in poetic or literary diction .

		But words themselves live and move , have in themselves being , expres - sion , action .

		This is truer of Italian words than of those of any other modern speech .

		Benelli 's words have characters , movements , lineaments of their own .

		They are noble , generous , bold , false , cruel , hateful ; they bear themselves boldly , rear themselves proudly ; they fly , or they crawl , sneak , crouch , prowl ; they smile , frown , grin , weep ; they storm and roar ; they groan , mutter , hiss .

		We look on their faces as on living forms .

		All this gives an effect as of a kind of internal drama to his printed page .

		As Giannetto tells of his persecu - tion at the hands of the brutal Chiaramentesi and .

		takes revenge to be his mistress , we hear his suffer - ing in the great sobbing words , and read his fero - cious resolution in their bitter smiles and grinding teeth .

		And now for the final effect of his drama is it anything more than an assembly of scenes recalled from the past , a little local color , a few baffling fig - ures set in clear light , a new collection of human types , pathetic , aspiring , grotesque , a few new-old phases of the endless struggle of man with man and with himself for the meager gifts of the gods love and freedom and truth and unity ?

		One is tempted to answer , protestingly , yes but there are
Benelli	PERSON	's own words on the first page of La Cena delle Beffe : This poetic comedy is dedicated to
Giulio di Frenzi	ORGANIZATION	, .

		beloved brother , who upon the shifting sand of art knows well how to trace and mark with his painful and subtile pen the bounds of our evil eternal and uniform , infinite , monotonous .

		If this is all that
Benelli	PERSON	will claim for his friend it were impertinence to claim more for himself .

		This is his philosophy and reason of art to in - spire the eyes , to stir the senses , to quicken the pulses , to spur the lagging step , to purge the mind of illusion and the soul of fear , to give higher value to the moments as they pass the art of relief and escape truly romantic and fundamentally pessi - mistic , as is all romance . ''

		ROBERT
MORSS LOVETT	ORGANIZATION	.

		Americanization and Walt Whitman A .

		MERICANIZATION is a word now frequent in print and on our tongues .

		The past five years have waked us abruptly to the fact that our cherished melting pot has in many instances conspicuously failed to fuse , and with laudable energy but lamentable precipitancy we have rushed to find remedies .

		Suggestions for the speediest possible making of an alien into an American are .

		crowded upon legislators and educators .

		It is no lack of patriotism but quite the contrary that makes the more thoughtful pause for a moment of self-ques - tion , as to what are these American ideals which we are so eager to teach to our immigrants .

		The American spirit does not seem so easy to label when one tries to translate it into curricula or laws .

		Love of country is as sensitive an emotion to expose to methods of efficiency as love of God .

		Humbly one wonders how so beautiful a thing as the spirit of
America	LOCATION	, that spirit for which once our fathers and lately our sons have died , is to be transmitted to the ignorant and down-trodden who seek our shores of promise .

		It is the priceless gift we would bestow with adoption , but the actual details of how to give it make one look about help - lessly for a textbook , make one ponder how to equip teachers to impart so sacred a study .

		In a recent
Atlantic	LOCATION	appeared an article entitled What
America Means	ORGANIZATION	to an Englishwoman .

		One pregnant paragraph gives a reader pause : '' If you ask me what is essentially American and could not have been born anywhere else , I can only think of
The Education of Henry Adams	ORGANIZATION	, the Introduction to
Victor Chapman	PERSON	's Letters , and
Walt Whitman	PERSON	, the
Rodin	PERSON	of poetry . ''

		The juxtaposition of names is provocative , but there is no reader who would not agree that the last is preeminent in expressing what
America	LOCATION	means to an American .

		Poet and prophet and patriot ,
Whitman	PERSON	is still the supreme spokesman of American democracy .

		To many of us the poems of Whitman have taught more than we could ever otherwise have known of our own patriotism ; and because of their proved inspiration to Americans , they are perhaps best fitted to em - body for an alien the spirit of his new country .

		This is far from saying that
Whitman	PERSON	is not too strong a draught to be offered untransmuted to a foreigner , but that there is no book so well fitted to clarify and vivify for the teacher of Americaniza - tion his own ideals .

		The mere name
Walt Whitman	PERSON	brings an in - stant exhilaration like the sudden sight of the stars and stripes billowing on the breeze .

		Like the flag THE DIAL
May 31	DATE	his name connotes space , for his descriptions touch as vast and varied a territory as that over which the flag floats .

		Pride of place is a foundation element in patriotism , the one that constrains it to take certain individual forms of expression in na - tional character and action and literature .

		The Swiss is molded by his mountains , the
Hollander	PERSON	by his dykes , the Norwegian by his mysterious dark and daylight ; the American , if he is to be true inheritor of the land that has been given him , needs to tune his soul to wide spaces , unchained cataracts , limitless prairie , and to cities seething with incredible .

		energy .

		There is no poet but Whitman fitted to be the poet of all these
United States	LOCATION	.

		His song can not be chained to any one locality .

		His pictures flash on us reminiscence from the
Adirondacks	LOCATION	to
Florida	LOCATION	, from his busy Manhat - tan to
California	LOCATION	.

		We too need to be spacious people like Whitman if we are to be worthy heirs , so that we can say with him : I inhale great draughts of space ; The east and the west are mine , and the north and the south are mine .

		Genuine patriotism is always expressive of place in no vague , but in most specific correspondence of national character to national geography .

		Not only should vastness and variety somehow translate themselves into our national qualities , but we should reflect in our energy some of the limitless resources and fecundity of our land .

		No poet has celebrated this native energy with more inspira - tion for our efforts than Whitman .

		His farm scenes are always busy ; '' the song of the broad axe '' rings through his forests ; cities and factories teem with life .

		There is no remoteness of reverie about this poet of a pioneer people .

		He celebrates always a tireless activity .

		Yet American energy as Whit - man expresses it is never fevered but always pur - poseful .

		Voicing ideals for industry that we should like to cherish and , in spite of his sturdy realism , suppressing that sordidness of toil which we should like to annul , Whitman always paints work as joyous .

		For him the singing man had not vanished perhaps
Whitman	PERSON	's own singing , if only we listen , may some day bring him back , as
Whitman	PERSON	knew him : I hear
America	LOCATION	singing , the varied carols I hear ; ~ ~ Those of mechanics each singing his , as it should be , blithe and strong .

		Always Whitman viewed the vitality of Amer - ica as essentially a pjoneer vitality , the health and courage and force of men brave enough to build a new world .

		In Whitman 's lifetime he saw this pioneer activity chiefly applied to actual frontier conditions , but his vision reached into the future and imaged other frontiers for his nation to ad - venture .

		It is significant for us today that his clarion call to courage `` Pioneers !

		O Pioneers '' should be placed under the general heading of Marches Now the War is Over .

		Today when the world is again breathless and spent over this latest war for freedom , we need again Whitman 's ring - ing incentive : Have the elder races halted ?

		Do they droop and end their lesson , wearied over there , beyond the seas ?

		We take up the task eternal , and the burden , and the lesson , Pioneers !

		O pioneers !

		Above all other American ideals for which we may turn to Whitman to find expression and re - inforcement of our own conviction , a catholic breadth of hospitality is paramount .

		The
United States	LOCATION	is an entity fused from myriad nations to each of which each of us owes something .

		No land ever befriended the foreigner so generously as ours , and the grace of that sympathy is some - thing we must hold fast if we are to be worthy of the sacred trust of transmitting the soul of
America	LOCATION	to the soul of the stranger .

		Because with - in these last tragic years there has been sporadic abuse of our welcome , we must not forget that the loyal have outnumbered the traitorous a thousand to one .

		We need to turn to Whitman that we may more surely recall our clearer motives before the heat and hatred of a world war .

		Whit - man too was fresh from a conflict where cruelty and oppression had almost prevailed , but his sympathy was not abated .

		If some of the strangers within our gates have failed us , others by the thousands have braved death to vindicate the ideals of our
United States	LOCATION	and theirs .

		To these and to others of their kind we owe all that we long to bestow under the complex and subtle term Amer - icanization .

		There was no man of whatever race or color or country that Whitman 's sympathy could not have found a way to reach : This moment yearning and thoughtful , sitting alone , It seems to me there are other men in other lands , yearn - ing and thoughtful ; It seems to me I can look over and behold them , in
Germany	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Spain	LOCATION	or far , far away , in
China	LOCATION	, or in
Russia	LOCATION	or
India	LOCATION	talking other dialects ; And it seems to me if I could know those men , I should become attached to them , as I do to men in my own lands ; O , I know we should be brethren and lovers , I know I should be happy with them .

		Of all the pioneer adventure that Whitman coveted for his countrymen there was none dearer to him than the difficult and daring adventure of brotherhood : I will establish in the
Mannahatta	LOCATION	, and in every city of these States , inland and seaboard , And in the fields and woods , and above every keel , little or large , that dents the water ,
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 539 Without edifices , or rules , or trustees , or any argument , The institution of the dear love of comrades .

		Over and over again ,
Whitman	PERSON	's poems affirm the
New World	LOCATION	welcome to the Old World im - migrant : All you continentals of
Asia	LOCATION	,
Africa	LOCATION	,
Europe	LOCATION	,
Australia	LOCATION	, indifferent of place !

		All you on the numberless islands of the archipelagoes of the sea !

		And you of centuries hence , when you listen to me !

		And you , each and everywhere , whom I specify not , but include just the same !

		Health to you !

		Good will to you all from me and
America	LOCATION	sent .

		For the teacher humble enough to feel that he himself needs instruction before he shall presume to teach Americanization , there is no nobler text - book than the poems of Whitman .

		If only we can breathe his inspiration deeply enough we may safely leave all the details of its application to American efficiency .

		More simply stated , if we can succeed in being as good Americans as was
Walt Whitman	PERSON	, we shall know how to make good Americans of other people .

		WINIFRED
KIRKLAND	PERSON	.

		Americanizing the Immigrants J .

		HE TRUE PATRIOT , it is to be assumed , welcomes sincere criticism of his country and is a bit embar - rassed when her praises are sung ; if by foreigners , suspecting them of flattery ; if by the native-born , of emptiness or worse .

		Best praise and criticism of all is that of the naturalized American , caring enough for his new home to become a citizen , yet possessing standards of comparison , the inheritor of benefits from another land .

		Though one of the fam - ily , he is , like an - adopted son , a bit detached in spirit , one fitted to take notes .

		It is somewhat unjust to the Rev.
Enrico C. Sar	PERSON	- torio in quoting from his book , Social and Religious Life of Italians in
America	LOCATION	-LRB-
Christopher Publishing House	ORGANIZATION	;
Boston	LOCATION	-RRB- to emphasize his criticisms of the country of his adoption , for he is ardently patriotic and sanguine of the future .

		So too in citing from Mr.
Horace J. Bridges	PERSON	' essays , On Becoming an , American -LRB-
Marshall Jones	ORGANIZATION	;
Boston	LOCATION	-RRB- , for Mr. Bridges sees more clearly than nine out of ten of the native-born whatever is great and good in the American spirit and tradition .

		Yet in both it is from their strictures and their suggestions of amendment that we can derive most profit , particularly at this time when there is under way a widespread move - ment to Americanize the immigrant more efficiently than in the past .

		For in how few quarters is there any clear notion of what Americanization means .

		That there are more Italians in
New York City	LOCATION	than in
Rome	LOCATION	, in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	more than in Flor - ence , is perhaps no news to the socially informed ; but such comparisons are nevertheless always illu - minating , awakening us anew to our obligations to this race but one of many if it is to become an integral part of our national life .

		We know too that the Italians largely build our railroads and sup - ply much of the unskilled labor upon which the country has hitherto based its economic prosperity .


Steiner	PERSON	is quoted as estimating that ten thousand foreigners a year '' lay down their lives diggntg coal , making steel , blasting stones , and doing the number - less dangerous drudgeries of the industrial life of the country . ''

		In return the immigrant is exploited at every turn , receives little or no compensation for industrial accidents , and crowds the slums of our cit - ies , forming colonies where he may live among his countrymen and speak their language .

		He learns , consequently , little English , and is seldom natural - ized .

		Being often a tiller of the soil the South Italians mostly so he finds in city life little exercise for his knowledge , nor are his many excellent virtues such as suffice him , unaided , to endure for long the strain of new conditions .

		Says Mr.
Sartorio	PERSON	: '' In
Italy	LOCATION	we know the difference between a peasant who has lived there always , and one who has spent a few years in
America	LOCATION	and then goes back .

		The former is poorer , but the latter is quite often rotten . ''

		Despite the fine work done by
Hull House	ORGANIZATION	in Chi - cago , and similar agencies , we do not as a people make any effort to understand our immigrants or to aid them .

		To quote again from Mr.
Sartorio	PERSON	: Where does the fault lie ?

		In prejudice and indiffer - ence , and in the spirit of patronage .

		Americans who judge by appearances , who have not traveled in
Italy	LOCATION	or studied modern Italian life , scornfully turn away from the Italian immigrant because he is not clean-shaven or as well-kempt as the American w.orkingman .

		Other Americans do not concern themselves with foreigners .

		They have a vague knowledge that there is somewhere in some God-forsaken corner of the city , a foreign popu - lation , and that is all .

		The American point of view is compactly expressed in the remark cited from the report of a group of social workers : '' Not yet Americanized ; still eating Italian food . ''

		The
Bureau of Naturalization	ORGANIZATION	, presumably in - tended to be of constructive service in the process of Americanization , replies to the applicant for citizen - ship papers with a letter stating that `` It ... wants to help you to get a better position that pays 54-0 THE DIAL
May 31	DATE	you more money for your work , '' and adds that '' the superintendent of the public schools of your city has promised to teach you the things you should know to help you to get a better position . ''

		A let - ter not designed , surely , to awake in the new citi - zen the ideals either of
Garibaldi	PERSON	or Lincoln , but justifying him in his belief that Americans care only for money and worldly success .

		Of governmental bureaus one does not , of course , expect much spirit - ual vision .

		Yet the churches are no better .

		Mr.
Sartorio	PERSON	cites a conference of representatives of all the ' Evangelical churches to consider extensive re - ligious work among the foreigners of the community . ''

		Not a single representative of the different foreign colonies was invited ... The good repre - sentatives of that gathering felt no need of advice from the educated leaders of the different races which they desired to influence . ''

		Mr.
Sartorio	PERSON	's suggestion of one means whereby in the naturalizing process , which now affects al - most solely the second generation , much needless pain , - cultural loss , and even criminality may be obviated will doubtless fall coldly upon the ears of those patriotic Americans who feel that the best and quickest way to naturalize the foreigner is as soon as possible to make him forget his native speech , substituting therefor , in the public schools , commer - cial Spanish in view of the commercial possibilities -LRB- somewhat dubious -RRB- of
Latin America	LOCATION	: The children of foreign extraction learn English and , as very little is done in school to make them keep up the language of their parents , they soon forget it , with the result that their home life is destroyed ... It is sad to notice the patronizing attitude that the child assumes towards his father and mother after a few months in the public school ... When I discuss the matter with teachers in the public schools , I become aware that they possess a holy horror of teaching children the language and history of
Italy	LOCATION	.

		In my opinion the way to preserve the home life of the children of immigrants is to teach through the language and history of their fathers that in every country men and women have always been ready to sacrifice their personal interest for the sake of their country .

		By making these children realize that they are connected by blood with a race of glorious tradi - tions , and by adoption have come to belong to a country which has also a glorious past , the love for
America	LOCATION	will be kept in their hearts without their acquiring a feeling of contempt for their fathers ' country .

		Mr.
Bridges	PERSON	, English born and trained in the Eng - lish tradition , making his home in the
United States	LOCATION	only when he was mature , and after careful consid - eration , conceives it to be the '' business of
America	LOCATION	, to produce a new type of national character and civ - ilization by the cross-fertilization of the many cul - tural types which the Republic has absorbed and is absorbing . ''

		This thesis he develops at length , it being his conviction that hybrid civilizations have always , as history shows , been culturally the most rich .

		In the
United States	ORGANIZATION	we have now , undevel - oped and unappreciated , the materials for a new and richer civilization than the world has yet seen : It is an astonishment to me that so few Americans seem aware of the great educational opportunity which lies at their doors , through contact with their fellow-citizens of alien origin .

		One would have .

		expected a priori that familiarity with foreign languages would be more gen - eral among Americans than among any other people .

		Yet the fact , I fear , is precisely the opposite of this .

		My impression , tested on a fairly large scale , is that among native-born Americans there are comparatively few who are really at home in the language and literatures of continental
Europe	LOCATION	... We blame our foreigners for their clannishness .

		We resent the fact that they sequester themselves among people of their own race , and do not take the trouble to understand our language or our his - tory and institutions ; but we are guilty of an exactly analogous piece of provincialism when we betray our unwillingness to learn from them , while expecting them to learn from us .

		Mr. Bridges objects to our favorite figure of speech , '' the melting pot , '' as one utterly unsuited to define the Americanizing process . ''

		There is , '' he observes , '' no such thing as humanity-in-general , into which the definite , heterogeneous , living creat - ure can be melted down ... There is no hu - man mould in
America	LOCATION	to which the spiritual stuff of the immigrant is to be patterned .

		Not only is there as yet no fixed and final type , but there never can be . ''

		He adds that '' the very genius of democ - racy , moreover , must lead us to desire the widest possible range of variability , the greatest attain - able differentiation of individuality , among our pop - ulation ... The business of
America	LOCATION	is to get rid of mechanical uniformity , and , by encouraging the utmost possible differentiation through mental and psychic cross - fertilization , to attain to a higher level of humanity . ''

		Mr. Bridges would have the foreign-language press fostered rather than discouraged , not only to afford Americans an opportunity to learn of their neighbors , for he would have every American read at least one foreign language paper , but also as a means to genuine Americanization of the foreign - born and their acquaintance with the spirit and ideals of the Republic .

		Foreign societies are likewise one of the best means to Americanization and serve another purpose only less important : Let them keep alive Italian and German music and literature , Balkan handicrafts , and the folk-lore and folk dances of the Old World ; not for the sake of the Old World , but as elements contributory to American culture .

		Let them spend as much time in bringing the spirit and meaning of American institutions home to their members as in bringing home to Americans the spirit and meaning of their European traditions .

		As a specific means to '' cultural cross-fertiliza - tion '' Mr. Bridges suggests that every immigrant be a member not only of a society of his own national origin , but '' also a member of an international society composed of representatives of as many
1919	DATE	THE DIAL different peoples as possible . ''

		The native-born , like - wise , for the good of his soul and the eradication of his provincialism , should be a member of an inter - national society .

		Intermarriage between persons of different national descent , which is also advocated , can be safely left , one imagines , to take care of it - self .

		But the establishment of municipal theaters in which plays in all languages shall be presented , a useful and timely suggestion , will need to be pushed if it is to be realized .

		In the light of these suggestive books it is some - what depressing to turn to the state policy of Amer - icanization initiated by the
Delaware State Council of Defense	ORGANIZATION	.

		The motive is frankly commercial .

		Fearful that the end of the war is to see an exodus of workers from
Delaware	LOCATION	to other fields of indus - try or to their native lands , '' the most hard-headed men have come to see that the way to attract work - men is to attach them to the community . ''

		The pamphlet of the
League	ORGANIZATION	continues : Some of the employers take it out in throwing up their hands and cursing the scum of
Europe	LOCATION	... A few enlightened employers , however , see that they can control this situation just as they have controlled many other difficulties in business by an enlightened cooperative policy .

		Letting the situation alone means leaving it to the
I. W. W.	PERSON	and to other forces of disintegration .

		Radi - cal agents depend always upon the ignorance of the men as their chief asset for their purposes .

		As soon as the man understands English and has some glimmering of Ameri - can ideals and becomes attached to some given com - munity , he is a less hopeful prospect for the
I. W. W	ORGANIZATION	.

		The '' enlightened '' policy of the
Delaware State Council of Defense	ORGANIZATION	is obviously at best , but enlight - ened self-interest stimulated by fear .

		And yet it would be unjust wholly to dismiss their declaration on this ground .

		That industrial managers in Del - aware have anything to learn from the foreigners in their midst is a thought that has , indeed , ntver en - tered their innocent hard heads , or that the cultural richness of the state could be enhanced by grafting upon it the culture of
Poland	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	.

		Neverthe - less the night schools they have established to teach English and civil government will do something to make the immigrant a better prospective citizen , and a gleam of light is evident in the statement that '' Americanization is a two-fold matter , it carries a practical industrial advantage , and is also a means of producing better citizenship in the communities of this state . ''

		And , again : '' Americanization is above all else a cooperative activity ; impose it upon the foreigner , and he will repudiate it ; plan it with him , and he will carry his share of the load . ''

		Perhaps , with a better and more permanent citizenship of for - eign extraction , cultural benefits will in time ensue .

		More is involved in this problem of
Americaniza	LOCATION	- tion than the cultural enrichment of our national life and the conversion of our present provincial spirit .

		In the internationalism which is coming , peace among the nations and their cooperation to the larger ends of a world civilization are depend - ent upon the good will and reciprocal understand - ing among men of diverse stocks and cultures .

		If we are to work with Russian , Frenchman , Italian , and German to the attainment of our common welfare and security , ' the first step to that end is a greater sympathy with and appreciation of the foreigners now among us .

		If we truly absorb them , and are modified by contact with them as they by us , we shall be better prepared to assume our duties in the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Federal Suffrage Amendment U THE PRINCIPLE of women 's suffrage there can now be no further debate .

		Every device of unreason has been exhausted by its opponents , and their arguments have long since been relegated to the museums of political antiquities .

		The contest has now been shifted to a different field .

		Of federal suffrage by constitutional amendment we are now certain ; and the only point at issue is the actual date of its passage .

		That has raised an interesting question of political method .

		The most representa - tive of the suffrage societies , headed by Dr.
Shaw	PERSON	and Mrs.
Chapman Catt	PERSON	, proceed upon the ordinary assumptions of the classical theory of representative government .

		Men , so they urge , are the creatures of reason and the suffrage has an unanswerable case .

		They have only to put confidence in the resistless logic of the facts to secure their goal .

		Speeches , deputations , pamphlets , the record of women 's achievement and the results of the vote in suffrage states here is the material for a campaign of which the success is ultimately certain .

		Even Senator Lodge must one day feel his antiquarianism ; for right and truth are bound in the end to prevail .

		And it is upon a charming insistence upon the , in - tellectual case for the vote that they have laid all the emphasis of their effort .

		In a bopk that is already a decade old , Mr.
Graham Wallas	PERSON	laid down a thesis which suggested that human nature is in fact more complex than this easy Benthamism would seem to suggest .


John Stuart Mill	PERSON	wrote an unanswerable argument for women suffrage in the sixties ; arid if logic was the 542 THE DIAL
May 31	DATE	main element in politics suffrage for women would have found its place in the Reform Act of
1867	DATE	.

		In fact , the struggle took fifty years ; and to anyone who looks back over the
last ten years	DATE	of its history in
England	LOCATION	the psychology of the movement will be seen to have different foundations .

		We live in a big world and it is difficult for any government to find time to answer the calls upon its attention .

		What it does , perhaps also since politics is by its nature a philosophy of the second best what it is bound to do is to proceed upon the assumption that what is politically innocuous is , for practical purposes , non-existent .

		The rule is well enough known .

		So long as parties are not closely influenced by the matter in debate , it may well enough be left to take care of itself .

		There must be no glaring injustice , since that would give your opponents ground for criticism .

		But the public need be given nothing that it does not insistently demand .

		A powerful interest must always be conciliated at the expense of interests which fail to attract attention .

		Decisions must be evaded unless they insistently demand response .

		In the result , that unanswerable logic of the case on which Dr.
Shaw	PERSON	and Mrs.
Catt	PERSON	pin their faith is really unrelated to the realities of political life .

		The telephone operators of
Boston	LOCATION	would not have secured Mr.
Burleson	PERSON	's defeat by trusting to the unanswerable logic of their case and to that alone .

		The Railroad Brotherhoods in
1916	DATE	would never have brought Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	to urge the justice of the eight-hour day except by forcing - him to a point where the issue could no longer be evaded .

		Social improvement is always born of a refusal to depend any longer upon the relentless pressure of unending time .

		It is born of a determination to produce a set of circumstances where action is irresistibly necessary .

		Men are pricked into thought not by a passionate desire to set right the whole world but by being brought to see that in a given ` set of circumstances thought is cheaper than inertia .

		And thought must be driven by its continuity into action if the original inertia is not to be resumed .

		That , certainly , is the history of women suffrage in
England	LOCATION	.

		It came in
1918	DATE	simply because events in the eight years before the war had made it in - evitable .

		No English statesman would have lived over again the wholesale irritations of the militant movement .

		Members hated to have their con - stituents arrested .

		Ministers were irritated beyond endurance by the impossibility of burking the issue .

		They lied , they evaded , they shuffled , they showed , like Mr.
Asquith	PERSON	, a proud impermeability to the obvious facts .

		The war came and with it the wide extension of female labor .

		The government was glad to attribute to the service of war what in fact was due to the irritations of peace .

		But they in reality yielded to the effort of the militant move - ment which , between
1906	DATE	and
1914	DATE	, made suffrage for the first time a genuine issue .

		Suffrage would have been secured , war or no war ; but Mr.
Asquith	PERSON	was able to make a more congenial recantation , and Mr.
George	PERSON	to compensate for a typical piece of double-dealing , by an atmosphere in which the real causal sequence had been forgotten in a vaster drama .

		Something of the same situation has developed in
America	LOCATION	in the last few years .

		The
National Women 's Party	ORGANIZATION	represents the early stage of the English militant movement .

		It secures the typical abuse of those respectable people whose ' faith in the suffrage is so urgent that they will do anything on its behalf except the thing most likely to achieve it .

		They think it unladylike , abominable , con - temptible , to do things that increase the difficulties of the President ; as though anything can be got in
America	LOCATION	except by making it impossible for the President to refrain from doing it .

		They urge that militancy has put back their cause for years ; while in the same breath they acclaim its triumph in the next
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		They can not have it both ways .

		In
December , 1916	DATE	, the federal amendment wanted one hundred votes :
today	DATE	it is certain of passage .

		If militancy has done so much harm , it were de - voutly to be hoped that every good cause were so served by its mistaken adherents .

		The real truth , of course , is that the militant
National Woman	ORGANIZATION	's Party was the only suffrage society to see the inexorable logic of the situation .

		The President 's party was an incubus on his back , and their hostility to suffrage was a part of the cross he had to bear .

		Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	would smile benignly at deputations and make pleasing speeches to in - dividual callers .

		But he would not take his party seriously in hand for the sake of diminishing the number of deputations .

		And , in any case , the ordinary suffragist was so humbly grateful for the least crumb of comfort , that Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	must have felt , when he received them , that it was really unnecessary to go further lest the depth of their gratitude hinder the retention of their self-respect .

		The militants were better psychologists .

		They were dissatisfied with Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's hopes and speeches .

		His supporters made promises in the West in
1916	DATE	and their redemption was some re - marks to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	on Filipino self-government .

		Miss
Paul	PERSON	and her party interrupted his remarks and Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	had thereby made the suffrage an issue of the first importance .

		On
January 9 , 1917	DATE	, he told a deputation that a federal amendment was hopeless .

		The pickets were placed aoout the
White House	ORGANIZATION	.

		They were arrested and imprisoned ; on
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 543 their release they went to prison again .

		Mr.
Wil	PERSON	- son began to take notice .

		Congressmen began to hold communications , to offer terms , to watch with the troubled suspicion of men who know that elec - tion is only a year away .

		The President gave away pardons like theatre-tickets ; but the women wanted not pardons but the suffrage , and they went to prison again .

		Little by little the things that had been , as Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	said , in
1917	DATE	impossible be - came , as the year closed , within the range of action .

		In
January 1918	DATE	in a
House	ORGANIZATION	previously most hostile the amendment was accepted and Mr.
Wil	PERSON	- son ate his previous w r ords and hurried to its sup - port .

		Clearly , he was getting anxious , for the next Congressional elections began to draw near and it is not Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's habit to offer gifts -LRB- and votes -RRB- to the Republicans .

		From the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	the mili - tants turned to the states and began to oppose Democrats who were hostile to suffrage in the primaries .

		Little by little hostility in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	dwindled down to two ; and these Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	could have removed if he had treated Senator
Shields	PERSON	as he treated
Hardwick	PERSON	and
Vardaman	PERSON	.

		But instead he still refused to admit that he was so obviously the head of his party as to hold it in his hands .

		Senator Jones elaborately explained last
September	DATE	that the time-table of the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	left no room for the amendment .

		Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	told the peaceable societies , on
September 26 , 1918	DATE	, how much he hoped for and with them , and his anxiety that they should win -LRB- as he only could secure -RRB- the necessary votes in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	.

		Fair words to an ancient and beguiling tune and the militant suf - fragists burnt those words .

		It is coincidence , but significant coincidence , that on the next day Senator
Jones	PERSON	found a place for women suffrage in the time - table .

		It is coincidence , but still significant coinci - dence , that a week later Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	was urging the amendment to the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	in the most earnest effort he had ever made upon its behalf .

		It may , of course , be urged that association is not causation , and that this progress is in despite of , and not because of , militant activity .

		The whole of historic experience is against that contention . ''

		If the people of this country , '' said Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	in
1869	DATE	, `` had obeyed the precept to preserve order and eschew violence , the liberties of this country would never have been obtained . ''

		The reforms of
1832	DATE	and
1867	DATE	were not a peaceful surrender to logic ; they were an ungrateful yielding to militancy .

		The pickets , the burning of speeches , the interrup - tion of Congressional debate , brought suffrage down from the clouds of argument to the solid earth of action .

		Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	did not want suffragists im - prisoned for the backwardness of his supporters .

		He did not want the pickets round the
White House	ORGANIZATION	for Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	to see and smile at , as he remembered the pickets in Downing Street .

		He did not want Russians who had seen the women of
Russia	LOCATION	emancipated , to ask themselves if his fine phrases about democracy were in fact applicable to American conditions ; Russians were so terribly literal-minded and there were difficulties , like
Mooney	PERSON	and conscientious objectors , to trouble him in addition .

		He did not want his speeches burned , not merely because he did believe in their truth in those realms where the Democratic Party was in reality democratic , but because he saw that more and more the women in suffrage states would tend to regard his supporters as useless and swing their influence to the Republican side .

		That was why he became the urgent advocate of the amendment a little too late perhaps , but he woufd have been in time had it not been for the eager disciples of respectability who urged him to pay no heed to those women who were disgracing a movement they themselves would never in such fashion press as to inconvenience him .

		No external observer can doubt that it is the blindness of the peaceful suffragists to political reality which lost women the vote in the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	recently ended .

		In the special session presently to be summoned it does not seem that the issue is doubtful .

		The Republicans are , on this factor at least , alive to the new significance of the
West	LOCATION	.

		They do not want the experience of the Democratic party in the last three years .

		They remain untrammeled by doctrines of State-rights , by a high and chivalrous regard for the women of the Mid-Victorian age , and the half - dozen similar obfuscated arguments by which the
Southern Senators	ORGANIZATION	attempted to delay the inevitable .

		The only danger is lest the Democrats should seek to delay the measure to prevent the Republicans from securing the credit of its passage .

		But Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	is on record on this matter and he can not avoid the issue .

		Nor is it likely that Miss
Paul	PERSON	and her supporters will release him from , the need of ac - tivity .

		They have a sufficient hold of political reality to know , as
Huxley	LOCATION	said , that while right and truth will ultimately prevail , a gentle assistance to their progress will do them no harm .

		Doubtless they have shocked the old-fashioned who thought that by deputations and the reading of
John Stuart Mill	PERSON	even a Presidential heart would be won .

		But it is worth while even to shock the old-fashioned in order to win the vote .

		It is worth while to make the effort that has distinguished the
National Women 's Party	ORGANIZATION	if only to demonstrate their under - standing of the mechanisms of politics .

		Therein , indeed , they removed the last objection a critic could have made to the final attainment of their freedom .


HAROLD J. LASKI	PERSON	.

		544 THE DIAL
May 31	DATE	American Art ?

		V > JRITICS IN THIS COUNTRY often assail the lack of a distinctively American art and strive to labor for its arrival .

		They long to see the spirit and surface flavors of
America	LOCATION	molded into sturdily esthetic art forms that will grow in unison with the inner and outer life about them .

		But art is ever a concentrated infidelity toward the semblances and spiritual averages of actual ex - istence .

		A blind and instinctive lack of communion with the outer forms and details of his environ - ments causes the artist to rear his individual 's refuge , in which the mandates of reason and eye - sight are delicately or incisively ignored .

		Some - times his world is tinged with detached fantasy ; at other times it wrestles with the salient motives of daily life .

		But even when he touches ' the con - crete , reiterated forms about him , his emphasis is upon what he would like them to be ; he takes liber - ties with their essence and visual outlines .

		Ex - amine the work of a Bellows or a
Glackens	PERSON	.

		These men seize upon details of their fishermen , prize - fighters , shopgirls , plowmen , and nudes , arid exag - gerate them to a world of semi-masquerading reality .

		The longings of these painters distort but do not utterly violate the common forms of life .

		Artists can never accurately reflect the ensemble - spirit and average contours of the formative age in which they dwell ; artists live upon their own hori - zons and ever recede to the mass of people approach - ing them . ''

		The clamoring nationalist in art does not realize this , nor the fact that the essence of a complicated age hides beneath the turmoil of exist - ence and needs the mellow retrospect of succeeding centuries to bring it forth .

		He also ignores the fact that national characteristics are but the broad colorings of art and not part of its substance .

		French art can immediately be distinguished from Russian , though both hold the same fundamentals .

		When centuries have concentrated and softened a nation , a wide color spreads over its life and from thence to its art .

		But this color steals from the womb of a slow process and can not arbitrarily be evolved by individual artists .


America	LOCATION	, in its ensemble , is the eagerly childlike forum of different races speaking one ill-assimilated language and joined by common social and ma - terial aspirations instead of esthetic ties or emo - tional undercurrents .

		The descendants of some of these races have submerged their original traits in a brassy surface melee in which swagger and earnest materialism are dominant notes ; other mem - bers of these races have kept their national tints more intact , thanks to their more recent immigra - tion ; still others have completely preserved their national colors , revealing these colors during lulls in material activity .

		The descendants of original settlers in this country have not , as yet , been fused into one emotional unit ; their surfaces touch , but their inner lives do not spontaneously meet in ways deeper than the bright , seeming union of material building and social exuberance .

		The memory of their forefathers and the solemn moments of Amer - ican history give these offspring of American pioneers a deceptive cohesion unsupported by any permanent , inner response in the individual .

		The American business man recollects
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	at patriotic festivals but does not make him a walk - ing-companion .

		Agricultural and small-town dwellers are rela - tively more crystalized than those in the larger cities , but even there no wide emotional traits exist .

		There is a sameness in the types of Sherwood An - derson 's Winesburg stories , but it is a Similarity of surface mannerisms and customs , of mechanical so - cial observances ; no deeply rooted reactions toward gaiety , melancholy , or pagan serenity , no emotional undercurrents can be discerned .

		A French com - munity would offer an equal variety of types blend - ing into an infinitely more compact intangible whole .

		The American nationalist in art dreams of a trend that will be toward `` the spirit of the prairies '' and `` Mrs.
Giovanitti	PERSON	carrying her bundle of wood , in the morning , on
Peoria	LOCATION	street '' and `` the husky laborer smilingly hewing a new world . ''

		But these are myriads of struggling details in a blithe whirl - pool in which no one group of objects is entitled to a distinctive role , in which a feverish interplay of material currents forms a disorganizing force against any quiet , vital fusion of emotional or men - tal longings .

		This applies even to the voices of be - ginning bands of artists .

		American art will attain a national shading with the slow march odf centuries , and even then this shading will steal over the creations of artists who will not consciously evolve it , but will recognize it in their finished products as a natural function .

		MAXWELL BODENHEIM .

		1919 THE DIAL 545 An Attitude Toward Poetic Revolt j \ jL ANY SINCERE LOVERS of poetry bear malice toward the present insurgency ; but the banners their standard-bearers raise seem curiously frayed and old .

		Does not their attitude rise out of an entire misconception ?

		The revolt in essence is not against the strongholds of
Parnassus	LOCATION	, but against a force drawn up along its slopes the shades of that which once was great .

		Such a re - bellion cries out for a public which will not be partisan , but will discriminate , intellectually and emotionally .

		There is no call to praise a poem merely because it is not that against which it is in revolt ; but the fact that a rabble of extremists are carrying along with them not a small propor - tion of a public which is reading poetry as never before makes it of importance that the construc - tive aims of the new poetry be understood and that its sincere workers find a sympathetic audience .

		Probably the most significant necessity is that for understanding the part conventions and form play in the creation of beauty .

		If some of the new workers believe they have succeeded in being form - less , the more successful among them realize the hopelessness and madness of such a pursuit .

		It is form which coordinates the impressions they wish to convey .

		Without form all is confusion the futurist poetry of
Marinetti	PERSON	is very close to the formless and confusion is only experience unas - similated , unrelated .

		Beauty is created when , by imaginative selection , the essentials are brought to - gether in an ordered whole , more real than reality , even as the
City	LOCATION	which is built To music : therefore never built at all , And therefore built forever .

		The point is that the given form , the given conven - tion , shares the transiency of all things human , not the fortunate immortality of the
City	LOCATION	.

		Perhaps no book in English has presented , in a manner so full of life and feeling , the part which the acceptance of convention plays in the creation of beauty as
John Livingston Lowes	PERSON	' Convention and Revolt in Poetry -LRB-
Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		He lends perspective to the present insurgency by his illuminating views about the dependence of art on the acceptance of convention and about the man - ner in which these conventions stiffen into death and give rise to revolt .

		Viewed in the light of this volume , the present revolt ceases to be unique , spontaneous , without historic background .

		Pre - senting Professor
Lowes	PERSON	' attitude , I choose , when - ever I can , to quote his language , even at the sac - rifice of brevity , in order to convey some impres - sion of its vitality and aptness of allusion : 1 .

		One element in convention is acceptance . ''

		Horse '' has a certain meaning because I accept its use in that sense .

		Another element is the ac - ceptance of illusion .

		I accept as one thing some - thing which is another and different thing hence , the inevitability of imagery .

		In a word , it is be - cause poetry is what it is that its conventions are what they are .

		2 .

		Two weighty and paradoxical facts have in - fluenced the development of poetry : the plasticity of conventions , while the life still runs in their veins ; and their tendency to harden into empty shells , like abandoned chrysalids , when the informing life has flown .

		3 .

		Through these two opposing characteristics , it comes about that art moves from stage to stage by two divergent paths by molding the still ductile forms -LRB- the way of constructive acceptance -RRB- and by shattering the empty shells -LRB- the way of revolt -RRB- .

		The two frequently alternate during dif - ferent periods , but they must be viewed as complementary .

		4 .

		Thus the present revolt is an old familiar friend , revisiting , with punctual observance of , its period , the glimpses of the moon .

		5 .

		The function of the revolutionists in poetry -LRB- who are quite the mildest-mannered men that ever scuttled ship or cut a throat -RRB- is to reach out , for new substance for its alchemy , into the regions of the strange .

		6 .

		After the pioneers there follow ' others , when the strange has become no longer strange , who transmute what the adventurers have brought with - in the circle into something that is enduringly old and new in one .

		7 .

		For originality , rightly understood , seldom concerns itself with minting a new and particular medium of its own .

		Genius of the highest order is far more apt to disclose the unexpected resources of whatever vehicle of expression it fails heir , to .

		Originality is the fixing of the familiar in the re - current act of becoming new .

		8 .

		It is poetry which , through its energizing influence , gives to words poetic quality ; it is not poetic diction which makes poetry .

		Thus the re - volt , when best informed , is not against this or that type of words per se , but against the use of any 546 THE DIAL
May 31	DATE	word solely for its adventitious values .

		It aims to use -LRB- in the language of the Imagist Manifesto -RRB- '' the exact word , not the nearly-exact word , nor the merely decorative word . ''

		9 .

		Upon the length or the development of the larger infinitely varying rhythmic units of poetry , meter does not impose any limitations whatever .

		They are merely taken up and merged with an - other rhythmic movement .

		By substituting rhythm alone for the fusion of rhythm and meter in one , free verse has foregone the great harmonic , orchestral effects of the old verse .

		Disengaged from .

		their luminous background , these propositions , although sound doctrine , no doubt fail to do full justice to Mr.
Lowes	PERSON	' atti - tude , and their bearing on the present question would be more vital could I report the examples and transitions by which they are reinforced ; but they are at least suggestive .

		The necessity for the acceptance of convention is particularly apropos and must be regarded as being somewhere in mind during the whole of this discussion .

		In much of the art of Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	, to take a case in point , we are given a substance compact of convention , but the conventions are those of
Japan	LOCATION	and have not yet been accepted by the Western world .

		For instance , the hokku -LRB- three lines -RRB- was originally followed by the ageku -LRB- two lines -RRB- .

		It became the custom to have the ageku given by a second person .

		Under Basho the ageku was dropped , but there was an implied continuation .

		To the Western mind , which has not accepted this convention , a poem of
Basho	ORGANIZATION	's such as : An old pond And the sound of a frog leaping Into the water has little beauty .

		Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	has a task indeed if he would bring that convention within the fold of Western appreciation ; unless he succeeds , that part of his poetry which is based upon it will re - main the art of a select group of the initiated .

		Consider now a second recent publication A New Study of English Poetry , by Sir
Henry New	PERSON	- bolt -LRB- Button -RRB- .

		This volume , again , without deal - ing primarily with the present movement , holds out to it the same cordial welcome , tempered by the same doubts , although the personalities and basic esthetic attitudes of Messrs.
Lowes	PERSON	and Newbolt differ widely .

		Mr.
Newbolt	PERSON	is perfectly clear on the subject of the necessity for form in poetry . ''

		The evil with which we have to contend , '' he says , '' is that old belief that form in art is an adornment , an added beauty independent of the subject and less important . ''

		He points out that the efforts of the vers-librists are not to free them - selves from form , but from forms those of older writers .

		It is only in the camp-followers of the school that indolence has led almost to formlessness , and therefore to failure .

		Mr.
Newbolt	PERSON	points a good caution : `` We have ceased to love affectation , elaboration , imitation of models ; we must not go on to make the mistake of imagining that a meter once used is used up . ''

		Different personalities will employ the same medium and secure widely differ - ent results .

		May I add that they will even employ the same ideas , those which are enduringly old and new in one ?

		The fact that
Shelley	PERSON	had written Ozymandias does not preclude our appreciating the following from Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	: The wind shakes the mists Making them quiver With faint drum-tones of thunder .

		Out of the crane-haunted mists of autumn , Blue and brown Rolls the moon .

		There was a city living here long ago , Of all that city There is only one stone left half-buried in the marsh , With characters upon it which no one now can read .

		Mr.
Newbolt	PERSON	devotes a chapter to the question of personality in art .

		A poem is to be regarded not as a finished product , but as the expression of a personality .

		Most anthologies are therefore of doubtful value , because they emphasize the isolated poem .

		The point is - well taken and the same might perhaps be said of magazines devoted to poetry .

		What Mr.
Newbolt	PERSON	thinks would make it pos - sible for the individual to appreciate the good in the new movement is a clear esthetic principle , a criterion by `` which to test his first impressions .

		If he is pursuing a will-o ' - the-wisp in this matter , let us follow him so far as we can .

		Definitions of poetry we have always with us .

		To Mr.
Newbolt	PERSON	'' poetry is the act of expressing an intuition in words . ''

		I shy at the word '' intuition , '' and re - luctantly but necessarily am drawn into the meta - physical lists , which Mr.
Lowes	PERSON	has so discreetly eschewed .

		The case is put as follows : We are placed in a world where there exist two great antagonistic forces consciousness and matter .

		_ They are antagonistic in this , that matter is naturally the sphere of fatality or necessity , while consciousness is naturally the sphere of freedom .

		Their antagonism must be remedied by life , which is simply consciousness attempting to turn matter to its own uses , to the uses of freedom .

		A .

		.

		We are all vessels , channels , vehicles , of one and the same spirit .

		Such a speculation makes an interesting diversion this it has in common with most metaphysics but it seems to have little pragmatic value beyond
Hegel	PERSON	's '' the beautiful is the absolute ideal real - izing itself . ''

		As it chances , this metaphysical speculation is not a diversion with Mr.
Newbolt	PERSON	.

		1919 547 It leads him promptly to the esthetic principle which is to guide us : The spirit of man has two activities : the esthetic or intuitive activity by which he gains perceptions , and the intellectual pr scientific activity by which he makes con - cepts or judgments .

		Poetry is the expression in human language of our intuitions ; prose is the expression of our judgments ... Good poetry , poetry in the full sense of the word , is the masterly expression of rare , difficult , and complex states of consciousness , of intuitions in which the highest thought is fused with simple percep - tions , until both become a new emotion .

		And of all the possible emotions , the strongest and most binding is felt when the poet 's consciousness of this world is tinged with man 's universal longing for a world more perfect .

		Mr.
Newbolt	PERSON	goes on triumphantly to the conclu - sion that '' the real world , the world of reason , of common sense , of prose , has of its own nature , no passion , no humor , no true drama , '' and he is even led to the belief that '' the western side of the world has sacrificed instinct to intellect . ''

		What such obscurantism does not see is that the processes leading to an intuition correspond to the steps of reasoning .

		The one takes place below the threshold of consciousness , the other above it ; if one is supernatural , so is the other .

		Thus the way out of the metaphysical swamp is through the fields of psychology , poorly tilled though they be .

		One of the most insidious delusions which the philos - ophers have bequeathed to us is the sharply defined contrast between spirit and matter .

		Psychology is freeing itself rapidly from this unfortunate at - titude , since in its experimental work it finds the intellect nowhere working independently of neural activity .

		Whatever the ultimate truth as to this relationship , we can never judge a poem by means of the intellect alone or by means of the emotions alone .

		The two are interwoven inextricably , and there is bound up with them the memory , the senses , and other factors .

		Mr.
Newbolt	PERSON	has tried in vain to extricate them .

		Through intellectual activity , he states , man takes his intuitions and of them makes comparisons , classes , generalizations , and deductions ; the expression of these in words is essential prose that is , Science .

		But such is the way of art too , except that at the touch of imagina - tion a miracle , and in the place of comparisons and deductions we have a thing of beauty .

		Life however has a way of tripping us up at the very moment when our hypotheses would carry us farthest into the clouds .

		We feel the cool earth of reality and our speculations are dispersed .

		Thus Mr.
Newbolt	PERSON	, in spite of a philosophical twist that is as questionable as it is popular at the present moment , really sees eye to eye with Mr.
Lowes	PERSON	and a great line of critics and poets .

		He has written a book of singular interest , which takes up enter - tainingly a variety of questions that can not be touched on here .

		Professor
Neilson	PERSON	once devoted a book to the problem The Essentials of Poetry but it would appear that he stopped short at explaining varying taste .

		It is a justification that is needed .

		With Mr.
Neilson	PERSON	there are three primary elements in poetry : reason , sense of fact , imagination .

		When the first predominates , the period is classical ; when the second , realistic ; when the third , romantic .

		The greatest art has the three characteristics in approx - ^ imately equal proportion .

		That is a very illumina - ting view to take of literary history ; but it indicates that in his mind there lurks the feeling that there is a greatest , although no one age may be able to apprehend it as a whole .

		In spite of the wealth of keen understanding in The Essentials of Poetry , a book that would be of infinite value in determining an attitude toward insurgency , we must seek else - where for a solution of the problem of relative values .

		The acceptance of convention , which Mr.
Lowes	PERSON	shows to be the fundamental necessity of poetic ex ^ pression , carries with it a c / rollary that will fur - nish the clue .

		For it implies the acceptance of standards .

		If that gives us nothing absolute , neither does it give us chaos .

		Conventions , however rap - idly they change , are bound together by the asso - ciation of ideas in the mind ; they are no more chaotic than the instinctive actions of an insect .

		As an example of how this principle of the accept - ance of standards may be applied , it should be noted that we fail , for the most part , to be moved by Chinese music , not because it is incapable of mov - ing human beings , but because we are not in the tradition .

		Some day we may be .

		On the other hand , we are gradually drawing out of the charmed circle of many previous ages , with a corresponding decline in the keenness of our appreciation of their literature .

		In a degree we can place ourselves in the tradition .

		by education , and in that fact we see and this is one of the important points to be made why the establishing of a rough and chang - ing scale of values is justified .

		The broader our appreciation that is , the more completely we as - similate varying traditions the more deeply we shall live .

		And this is why we can feel from the depths of our beings that the person whose tradi - tions lead him only to understand rag-time and slang and magazine covers is on a lower plane , artistic - ally , than he who has back of him the traditions of the great art of the past .

		And this is why there are standards , ideals for which artists are making daily sacrifices , values which lend richness to our lives .

		But it must not be forgotten that our atti - tude toward such standards is ever undergoing meta - morphosis .

		It is not of much consequence to hold that the values themselves are unchanged , for it is THE DIAL
May 31	DATE	our attitude that determines their complexion .

		Exactly as in the case of conventions .

		And what - ever the books teach us and however our modern - ists assail us with theories of new beauty , we shall take the complex way of the intellect working in and through the emotions , the two indissoluble , their relations indeterminate .

		The mind will discern cer - tain general principles -LRB- those quoted above from Mr.
Lowes	PERSON	will answer for the moment -RRB- and will apply those in so far as the emotions , with their rich , and controlling traditions , permit ; but so long as personality remains as the distinction of our kind , the mind and emotions of one will never conform entirely to the mind and emotions of another .

		We shall muddle through .

		But I do not mean to disparage the part which keen criticism and honest intensity of feeling must play .

		The impression one receives from a vast amount of the new verse is that of an absence of mental training and mental discipline .

		The idea is poured out without the taking of pains to ex - press it in the best possible manner .

		For instance note the following from
Carl Sandburg	PERSON	: REPETITIONS They are crying salt tears Over the beautiful beloved body Of
Inez Milholland	PERSON	, Because they are glad she lived , Because she loved open-armed , Throwing love for a cheap thing Belonging to everybody Cheap as sunlight , And morning air .

		Among the lesser men of the movement , who cast aside even the cadences to be noted in poems like the above , writing-paper is the target of all their thoughts , however incomplete , and before the printers ' ink is dry these fragments and sketches are blown about the earth .

		Frequently the attitude seems to be : `` This has come into my mind in this form .

		I should have failed my calling unless I were to express it precisely as it came to me . ''

		But it is a rare soul to whom ideas do come already clothed in their final form .

		Mostly they are born naked .

		One thinks of the pages of unilluminated music of

		The intellect , as Mr.

		Were this the habit of more poets at the present time , magazine mails might be lighter , but there would be a wholesome check on the impulse to immortalize every precious thought of the poet , even if it is ultimately to be preserved only in the pages of a never opened volume .

		Were the intellect always working , it must be remembered , in and through the emotions called upon to play the part indicated , I believe there would be far less occasion to criticize the new verse for its frequent lack of good taste .

		The exact expression of an idea may be the occupation of a life-time at least the poet who tires himself with '' seeking an epithet for the cuckoo '' need not envy him who writes a handful of poems of a morning .

		To sum up , our attitude toward the present re - volt in poetry can not be a simple one of acceptance or rejection .

		Mr.

		For it is not alone in the creation of beauty that a man must be ever a fighter ; if he would secure from life , for the moment the privilege is his , all that it has to offer , he must approach the appreciation of art with all of the intelligence and energy and honest intensity of feeling of which he is capable .

		EDEN PHILLPOTTS .

		The Industrial System and the Captains of Industry I T HAS BEEN USUAL , and indeed it still is not unusual , to speak of three coordinate '' factors of production '' : land , labor , and capital .

		The reason for this threefold scheme of factors in production is that there have been three recognized classes of in - come : rent , wages , and profits ; and it has been assumed that whatever yields an income is a pro- ductive factor .

		This scheme has come down from the eighteenth century .

		It is presumed to have been true , in a general way , under the conditions which prevailed in the
eighteenth century	DATE	, and it has there - fore also been assumed that it should continue to be natural , or normal , true in some eminent sense , under any other conditions that have come on since that time .

		Seen in the light of later events this threefold plan of coordinate factors in production is notable for what it omits .

		It assigns no productive effect to the industrial arts , for example , for the > conclusive reason that the state of the industrial arts yields no stated or ratable income to any one class of persons ; it affords no legal claim to a share in the commu - nity 's yearly production of goods .

		The state of the industrial art is a joint stock of knowledge derived from past experience , and is held and passed on as an indivisible possession of the community at large .

		It is the indispensable foundation of all productive industry , of course , but except for certain minute fragments covered by patent rights or trade secrets , this joint stock is no man 's individual property .

		For this reason it has not been counted in as a factor in production .

		The unexampled advance of technology during the past one hundred and fifty years has now begun to call attention to its omis - sion from the threefold plan of productive factors handed down from that earlier time .

		Another omission from the scheme of factors , as it was originally drawn , was the business man .

		But in the course of the nineteenth century the business - man came more and more obtrusively to the front and came in for a more and more generous portion of the country 's yearly income which was taken to argue that he also contributed increasingly to the yearly production of goods .

		So a fourth factor of production has provisionally been added to the threefold scheme , in the person of the '' entrepre - neur , '' whose wages of management are considered to measure his creative share in the production of goods , although there still is some question as to the precise part of the entrepreneur in productive industry . ''

		Entrepreneur '' is a technical term to designate the man who takes care of the financial end of things .

		It covers the same fact as the more familiar '' business man , '' but with a vague suggestion of big business rather than small .

		The typical entrepreneur is the corporation financier .

		And since the corpora - tion financier has habitually come in for a very sub - stantial share of the community 's yearly income he has also been conceived to render a very substantial service to the community as a creative force in that productive industry out of which the yearly income arises .

		Indeed it is nearly true that in current usage '' producer '' has come to mean '' financial manager , '' both in the standard economic theory and in every - day speech .

		There need of course be no quarrel with all this .

		It is a matter of usage .

		During the era of the machine industry which is also the era of the com - mercial democracy business men have controlled production and have managed the industry of the commonwealth for their own ' ends , so that the material fortunes of all the civilized peoples have continued to turn on the financial management of their business men .

		And during the same period not only have the conditions of life among these civilized peoples continued to be fairly tolerable on the whole , but it is also true that the industrial
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 553 system which these business men have been manag - ing for their own private gain all this time has con - tinually been growing more efficient on the whole .

		Its productive capacity per unit of equipment and man power has continually grown larger .

		For this very creditable outcome due credit should be , as indeed it has been , given to the business community which has had the oversight of things .

		The efficient enlargement of industrial capacity has , of course , been due to a continued advance in technology , to a continued increase of the available natural resources , and to a continued increase of population .

		But the business community have also had a part in bringing all this to pass ; they have always been in a position to hinder this growth , and it is only by their consent and advice that things have been enabled to go forward so far as they have gone .

		This sustained advance in productive capacity , due to the continued advance in technology and in popu - lation , has also had another notable consequence .

		According to the Liberal principles of the eighteenth century any legally defensible receipt of income is a sure sign of productive work done .

		Seen in the light of this assumption , the visibly increasing pro- ductive capacity of the industrial system has enabled all men of a liberal and commercial mind not only to credit the businesslike captains of industry with having created this productive capacity , but also to overlook all that the same captains of industry have been doing in the ordinary course of business to hold productive industry in check .

		And it happens that all this time things have been moving in such a direc - tion and have now gone so far that it is today quite an open question whether the businesslike manage - ment of the captains is not more occupied with check - ing industry than with increasing its productive capacity .

		This captain of industry , typified by the corpora - tion financier , and latterly by the investment banker , is one of the institutions that go to make up the new order of things , which has been coming on among all the civilized peoples ever since the Indus - trial Revolution set in .

		As such , as an institutional growth , his life history hitherto should be worth looking into for anyone who proposes to understand the recent growth and present drift of this new economic order .

		The beginnings of the captain of industry are to be seen at their best among those enterprising Englishmen who made it their work to carry the industrial promise of the - Revolution out into tangible performance , during the closing decades of the eighteenth and the early decades of the nine - teenth century .

		These captains of the early time are likely to be rated as inventors , at least in a loose sense of the word .

		But it is more to the point that they were designers and builders of factory , mill , and mine equipment , of engines , processes , machines , and .

		machine tools , as well as shop managers , at the same time that they took care , more or less effectually , of the financial end .

		Nowhere do these beginnings of the captain of industry stand out so convincingly as among the English tool-builders of that early time , who designed , tried out , built , and marketed that series of indispensable machine tools that has made the practical foundation of '' the me - chanical industry .

		Something to much the same effect is due to be said for the pioneering work of the Americans along the same general lines of mechanical design and performance at a slightly later period .

		To men of this class the new industrial order owes much of its early success as well as of its later growth .

		These men were captains of industry , entrepre - neurs , in some such simple and comprehensive sense of the word as that which the economists appear to have had in mind for a hundred years after , when they have spoken of the wages of management that are due the entrepreneur for productive work done .

		They were a cross between a business man and an industrial expert , and the industrial expert appears to have been the more valuable half in their composi - tion .

		But factory , mine , and ship owners , as well as merchants and bankers , also made up a vital part of that business community out of whose later growth and specialization the corporation financier of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries has arisen .

		His origins are both technological and commercial , and in that early phase of his life history which has been taken over into the traditions of economic theory and of common sense he carried on both of these lines of interest and of work in combination .

		That was before the large scale , the wide sweep , and the profound specialization of the advanced mechan - ical industry had gathered headway .

		But progres - sively the cares of business management grew larger and more exacting , as the scale of things in business grew larger , and so the directive head of any such business concern came progressively to give his atten - tion more and more exclusively to the '' financial end . ''

		At the same time and driven by the same con - siderations the businesslike management of industry has progressively been shifting to the footing of cor - poration finance .

		This has brought on a further division , dividing the ownership of the industrial equipment and resources from their management .

		But also at the same time the industrial system , on its technological side , has been progressively growing 554 THE DIAL
May 31	DATE	greater and going - farther in scope , diversity , special - ization , and complexity , as well as in productive capacity per unit of equipment and man power .

		The last named item of change , the progressive increase of productive capacity , is peculiarly signif - icant in this connection .

		Through the earlier and pioneering decades of the machine era it appears to have been passably true that the ordinary routine of management in industrial business was taken up with reaching out for new ways and means and speeding up production to maximum capacity .

		That was before standardization of processes and of unit products , and fabrication of parts had been carried far , and therefore before quantity production had taken on anything like its later range and reach .

		And , partly because of that fact because quantity production was then still a slight matter and greatly circumscribed , as contrasted with its later growth the ordinary volume of output in the mechanical industries was still relatively slight and manageable .

		Therefore those concerns that were engaged in these industries still had a fairly open market for what - ever they might turn out , a market capable of taking up any reasonable increase of output .

		Exceptions to this general rule occurred ; as , for example , in textiles .

		But the general rule stands out obtrusively through the
early decades of the nineteenth century	DATE	so far as regards English industry , and even more obviously in the case of
America	LOCATION	.

		Such an open market meant a fair chance for competitive produc - tion , without too much risk of overstocking .

		And running to the same effect , there was the continued increase of population and the continually increasing reach and volume of the means of transport , serving to maintain a free market for any prospective in - crease of output , at prices which offered a fair prospect of continued profit .

		In the degree in which this condition of things prevailed a reasonably - free competitive production would be practicable .

		The industrial situation so outlined began visibly to give way toward the middle of the nineteenth century in
England	LOCATION	, and at a correspondingly later period in
America	LOCATION	.

		The productive capacity of the mechanical industry was visibly overtaking the capacity of the market , so that free competition with - _ out afterthought was no longer a sound footing on which to manage production .

		Loosely , this critical or transitional period falls in and about the
second quarter of the nineteenth century	DATE	in
England	LOCATION	; else - where at a correspondingly later date .

		Of course the critical point , when business exigencies began to dictate a policy of combination and restriction , did not come at the same date in all or in most of i the mechanical industries ; but it seems possible to say that , by and large , the period of transition to a general rule of restriction in industry comes on at the time and for the reason so indicated .

		There were also other factors engaged in that industrial situation , besides those spoken of above , less notable and less sharply defined , but enforcing limitations of the same character .

		Such were , for example , a rapidly gaining obsolescence of industrial plant , due to improvements and extensions , as also the partial exhaustion of the labor supply by persistent over - work , under-feeding , and unsanitary conditions but this applies to the English case rather than elsewhere .

		In point of time this critical period in the affairs of industrial business coincides roughly with the coming in of corporation finance as the ordinary and typical method of controlling the industrial output .

		Of course the corporation , or company , has other uses besides the restrictive control of the output with a view to a profitable market , but it should be suffi - ciently obvious that the combination of ownership and centralization of control which the corporation brings about is also exceedingly convenient for that purpose .

		And when it appears that the general resort to corporate organization of the larger sort sets in about the time when business exigencies begin to dictate an imperative restriction of ouput , it is not easy to avoid the conclusion that this was one of the ends to be served by this reorganization of business enterprise .

		Business enterprise may fairly be said to have shifted from the footing of free-swung com - petitive production to that of a conscientious with - holding of efficiency , so soon and so far as corpora - tion finance on a sufficiently large scale had come to be the controlling factor in industry .

		At the same time and in the same degree the discretionary con - trol of industry , and of other business enterprise in great part , has passed into the hands of the corpora - tion financier .

		Corporate organization has continually gone for - ward to a larger scale and a more comprehensive coalition of forces , and at the same time , and more and more visibly , it has become the ordinary duty of the corporate management to adjust production to the requirements of the market by restricting the output to what the traffic will bear , that is to say , what will yield the largest net earnings .

		Under corporate management it rarely happens that produc - tion is pushed to the limit of capacity .

		It happens , and can happen , only rarely and intermittently .

		This has been true , increasingly , ever since the ordi - nary productive capacity of the mechanical industries seriously began to overtake and promised to exceed what the market would carry off at a reasonably
1919	DATE	555 profitable price .

		And ever since that critical turn in the affairs of industrial business somewhere in the
middle half of the nineteenth century	DATE	it has become increasingly imperative to use a wise mod - eration and stop down the output to such a rate and volume as the traffic will bear .

		The cares of busi - ness have required an increasingly undivided atten - tion on the part of the business men , and in an ever increasing measure their day 's work has come to center about a running adjustment of sabotage on production .

		And for this purpose , evidently , the corporate organization of this business , on an increas - ingly large scale , is very serviceable , since the requi - site sabotage on productive industry can be effec - tually administered only on a large plan and with a firm hand . ''

		The leaders in business are men who have studied and thought all their lives .

		They have thus learned to decide big problems at once , basing their decisions upon their knowledge of fundamental principles . ''


Jeremiah W. Jenks	PERSON	.

		That is to say , the surveillance of this financial end of industrial business , and the control of the requisite running balance of sabotage , have been reduced to a routine governed by settled principles of procedure and ad - ministered by suitably trained experts in corporation finance .

		But under the limitations to which all hurrian capacity is subject it follows from this in - creasingly exacting discipline of business administra - tion that the business men are increasingly out of touch with that manner of thinking and those ele - ments of knowledge that go to make up the logic and the relevant facts of the mechanical technology .

		Addiction to a strict and unremitting valuation of all things in terms of price and profit leaves them , by settled habit , unfit to appreciate those technologi - cal facts and values that can be formulated only in terms of tangible mechanical performance ; increas - ingly so with every further move into a stricter addiction to businesslike management and with every further advance of the industrial system into a still wider scope and a still more diversified and more delicately balanced give and take among its inter - locking members .

		They are experts in prices and profits and finan - cial maneuvers , and yet the final discretion in all questions of industrial policy continues to rest in their hands .

		They are by training and interest cap - tains of finance , and yet , with no competent grasp of the industrial arts , they continue to exercise a plenary discretion as captains of industry .

		They are unremittingly engaged in a routine of acquisition , in which they habitually reach their ends by a shrewd restriction of output , and yet they continue to be entrusted with the community 's industrial wel - fare , which calls for maximum production .

		Such has been the situation in all the civilized countries since corporation finance has ruled indus - try , and until a recent date .

		Quite recently this settled scheme of business management has shown signs of giving way , and a new move in the organi - zation of business enterprise has come in sight , whereby the discretionary control of industrial pro- duction is shifting still farther over to the side of finance and still farther out of touch with the re - quirements of maximum production .

		The new move is of a twofold character : -LRB- a -RRB- the financial captains of industry have been proving their indus - trial incompetence in a progressively convincing fashion , and -LRB- b -RRB- their own proper work of financial management has progressively taken on a character of standardized routine such as no longer calls for or admits any large measure of discretion or initiative .

		They have been losing touch with the management of industrial processes , at the same time that the management of corporate business has , in effect , been shifting into the hands of a bureaucratic clerical staff .

		The corporation financier of popular tradition is taking on the character of a chief of bureau .

		The changes which have brought the corporation financier to this somewhat inglorious position of a routine administrator set in along with the early growth of corporation finance , somewhere around the middle of the nineteenth century , and they have come to a head somewhere about the passage to the
twentieth century	DATE	, although it is only since the latter date that the outcome is becoming at all clearly defined .

		When corporate organization and the consequent control of output came into bearing there were two lines of policy open to the management : -LRB- a * -RRB- to maintain profitable prices by limiting the output , and -LRB- b -RRB- to maintain profits by lowering the production cost of an increased output .

		To some extent both of these lines were followed , but on the whole the former proved the more attractive ; it involved less risk , and it required less acquaint - ance with the working processes of industry .

		At least it appears that in effect the preference was increasingly given to the former method during this half-century of financial management .

		For this 1 there were good reasons .

		The processes of production were continually growing more extensive , diversified , complicaced , and more difficult for any layman in technology to comprehend and the corporation financier was such a layman , necessarily and increas - ingly so , for reasons indicated above .

		At the same time , owing to a continued increase of population 556 THE DIAL
May 31	DATE	and a continued extension of the industrial system , the net product of industry and its net earnings con - tinued to increase independently of any creative effort on the part of the financial management .

		So the corporation financier , as a class , came in for an '' unearned increment '' of income on the simple plan of '' sitting tight . ''

		That plan is intelligible to any layman .

		All industrial innovation and all aggressive economy in the conduct of industry not only presumes an insight into the ' technological details of the industrial process , but to any other than the technological experts , who know the facts intimately , any move of that kind will appear haz - ardous .

		So the business men who have controlled industry , being laymen in all that concerns its man - agement , have increasingly been content to let well enough alone and to get along with an ever increas - ing overhead charge of inefficiency , so long as they have lost nothing by it .

		The result has been an ever increasing volume of waste and misdirection in the use of equipment , resources , and man power throughout the industrial system .

		In time , that is to say within the last few years , the resulting lag , leak , and friction in the ordinary working of this mechanical industry under business management have reached such proportions that no ordinarily intelligent outsider can help seeing them wherever he may look into the facts of the case .

		But it is the industrial experts , not the business men , who have finally begun to criticize this busi - nesslike mismanagement and neglect of the ways and means of industry .

		And hitherto their efforts and advice have met with no cordial response from the business men in charge , who have , on the whole , continued to let well enough alone that is to say , what is well enough for a short-sighted business policy looking to private gain , however poorly it may serve the material needs of the community .

		But in the meantime two things have been happening which have deranged the regime of the corporation financier : industrial experts , engineers , chemists , minerologists , technicians of all kinds have been drifting into more responsible positions in the indus - trial system and have been growing up and multiply - ing within the system , because the system will no longer work at all without them ; and on the other hand , the large financial interests on whose support the corporation financiers have been leaning have gradually come to realize that corporation finance can best be managed as a comprehensive bureucratic routine , and that the two pillars of the house of corporate business enterprise of the larger sort are the industrial experts and the large financial con - cerns that control the necessary funds ; whereas the corporation financier is little more than a dubious intermediate term between these two .

		One of the greater personages in American busi - ness finance took note of this situation in the late nineties and set about turning it to account for the benefit of himself and his business associates , and from that period dates a new era in American cor - poration finance .

		It was for a time spoken of loosely as the Era of Trust-Making , but that phrase does not describe it at all adequately .

		It should rather be called the Era of the
Investment Banker	ORGANIZATION	, and it has come to its present stage of maturity and stability only in the course of the past quarter-century .

		The characteristic features and the guiding pur - pose of this improved method in corporation finance are best shown by a showing of the methods and achievements of that great pioneer by whom it was inaugurated .

		As an illustrative case , then , the American steel business in the nineties was suffering from the continued use of out-of-date processes , equipment , and locations , from wasteful manage - ment under the control of stubbornly ignorant cor - poration officials , and particularly from intermittent haphazard competition and mutual sabotage between the numerous concerns which were then doing busi - ness in steel .

		It appears to have been the last-named difficulty that particularly claimed the attention and supplied the opportunity of the great pioneer .

		He can by no stretch of charity be assumed to have had even a slight acquaintance with the technological needs and shortcomings of the steel industry .

		But to a man of commercial vision and financial sobriety it was plain that a more comprehensive , and there - fore more authoritative , organization and control of the steel business would readily obviate much of the competition which was deranging prices .

		The ap - parent purpose and the evident effect of the new and larger coalition of business interests in steel was to maintain profitable prices by a reasonable curtail - ment of production .

		A secondary and less evident effect was a more economical management of the industry , which involved some displacement of quon - dam corporation financiers and some introduction of industrial experts .

		A further , but unavowed , end to be served by the same move in each of the many enterprises in coalition undertaken by the great pioneer and by his competitors was a bonus that came to these enterprising men in the shape of an increased capitalization of the business .

		But the notable feature of it all as seen from the point of view of the public at large was always the stabiliza - tion of prices at a reasonably high level , such as would always assure reasonably large earnings on the increased capitalization .

		1919 THE DIAL 557 Since then this manner of corporation finance has been further perfected and standardized , until it will now hold true that no large move in the field of corporation finance can be made without the advice and consent of those large funded interests that are in a position to act as investment bankers ; nor does any large enterprise in corporation business ever escape from the continued control of the investment bankers in any of its larger transactions ; nor can any corporate enterprise of the larger sort now continue to do business except on terms which will yield something appreciable in the way of income to the investment bankers , whose continued supp & t is nec - essary to its success .

		The financial interest here spoken of as the investment banker is commonly something in the way of a more or less articulate syndicate of financial houses , and it is to be added that the same financial concerns are also commonly , if not invariably , engaged or interested in commer - cial banking of the usual kind .

		So that the same well-established , half-syndicated ramification of banking houses that have been taking care of the country 's commercial banking , with its center of credit and of control at the country 's financial metropolis , is ready from beforehand to take over and administer the country 's corporation finance on a unified plan and with a view to an equitable dis - tribution of the country 's net earnings among them - selves and their clients .

		The more inclusive this financial organization is , of course , the more able it will be to manage the country 's industrial system as an inclusive whole and prevent any hazardous inno - vation or experiment , as well as to limit production of the necessaries to such a volume of output as will yield the largest net return to itself and its clients .

		Evidently the improved plan which has thrown the discretion and responsibility into the `` hands of the investment banker should make for a safe and sound conduct of business , such as will avoid fluctuations of price , and more particularly avoid any unprofit - able speeding-up of productive industry .

		Evidently , too , the initiative has hereby passed out of the hands of the corporation financier , who has fallen into the position of a financial middleman or agent , with limited discretion and with a precariously doubtful future .

		But all human institutions are susceptible of improvement , and the course of improvement may now and again , as in his case , result in supersession and displacement .

		And doubtless it is all for the best , that is to say , for the good of business , more particularly for the profit of big business .

		But now as always corporation finance is a traffic in credit ; indeed , now more than ever before .

		Therefore to stabilize corporate business sufficientlv in the hands of this inclusive quasi-syndicate of banking interests ` it is necessary that the credit sys - tem of the country should as a whole be adminis - tered on a unified plan and inclusively .

		All of which is taken care of by the same conjunction of circumstances ; the same quasi-syndicate of banking interests that makes use of the country 's credit in the way of corporation finance is also the guardian of the country 's credit .

		From which it results that , as regards those large-scale credit extensions which are of substantial consequence , the credits and debits are , in effect , pooled within the syndicate , so that no substantial derangement of the credit situation can take effect except by the free choice of this quasi - syndicate of investment banking houses ; that is to say , not except they see an advantage to themselves in allowing the credit situation to be deranged , and not beyond the point which will best serve their collective purpose as against the rest of the com - munity .

		With such a closed system no extension of credit obligations or multiplication of corporate securities , with the resulting inflation of values , need bring any risk of a liquidaton , since credits and debits are in effect pooled within the system .

		By way of parenthesis it may also be remarked that under these circumstances '' credit '' has no par - ticular meaning except as a method of account 1 ing .

		Credit is also one of the timeworn insti - tutions that are due to suffer obsolescence 5y improvement .

		This process of pooling and syndication that is remaking the world of credit and corporation finance has been greatly helped on in
America	LOCATION	by the estab - lishment of the
Federal Reserve	ORGANIZATION	system , while some - `` what similar results have been achieved elsewhere by somewhat similar devices .

		That system has greatly helped to extend , facilitate , simplify , and consolidate the unified control of the country 's credit arrangements , and it has very conveniently left the substantial control in the hands of those larger finan - cial interests into whose hands the lines of control in credit and industrial business were already being gathered by force of circumstances and by sagacious management of the interested parties .

		By this means the substantial core of the country 's credit system is gathered into a self-balanced whole , closed and un - breakable , self-insured against all risk and derange - ment .

		All of which converges to the definitive sta - bilization of the country 's business ; but since it reduces financial traffic to a riskless routine it also converges to the conceivable obsolescence of corpora - tion finance and eventually , perhaps , of the invest - ment banker .

		558 THE DIAL
May 31	DATE
Conrad Aiken Metaphysical	ORGANIZATION	Poet HE WORLD is seriously in need of a new classifica - tion of poets .

		Hitherto we have been largely con - tent with the old labels of romantic and realist .

		But these old labels can no longer satisfy , for the boundaries of poetry have been enlarged since the
early nineteenth century	DATE	to embrace the whole field of scientific speculation which is our legacy from the evolutionists , the anthropologists , the psychol - ogists , the sociologists , and the men of science gen - erally .

		As we are today , it is evident that there may be quite as much romantic magic in a poet writ - ing from a mind stocked with purely scientific theory , as there is in
Shelley	LOCATION	; and as much realism in the narrower sense , in a poet of pure romantic tendency , as there is , say , in
Masefield	LOCATION	.

		We must seek finer distinctions .

		What is needed is not a new definition of the incomprehensible mystery called '' poetry , '' but a new classification of the poets themselves .

		When we come to examine English poetry , we can , if we observe closely , easily distinguish two main streams of inspiration fn it now parting , now fusing , sometimes clouded , and again distinct .

		There have been the poets who wrote largely of the aspects of things outside themselves ; and the poets who , turning within themselves , wrote of the world as mirrored in the human brain .

		We may call the first objective , and the second subjective ; or we may adopt a more recent nomenclature and label the first imagistic and the second symbolistic .

		But if the spirit of inquiry is strong within us neither of these labels can completely satisfy our intelligence .

		They do not completely cover the ground .

		We are per - haps safer if we say that the first group of poets are externalistic , and the second metaphysical , in tendency .

		There have been far more poets of the externalist type in English than of the metaphysical .

		And these poets have been more widely read and appreciated by their contemporaries indeed , by posterity than their neglected antitypes .

		This is partly due to the mental inertia of most of us an inertia that seeks to be soothed with pretty , easily explainable pictures and familiar tunes partly also to the extreme difficulty of writing good meta - physical verse .

		The good metaphysical poet must be always turning the world inside out , so to speak .

		And since the faculty of verse-writing is based pri - marily on an immediate emotional response to sensu - ous impression , it is apparent that the good meta - physical poet must be always battling against his own immediate apprehensions .

		This will explain the rarity of great metaphysical poets .

		In
England	LOCATION	there have been , so far as I remember ,
Donne	PERSON	facile princeps in this field also
Vaughan	PERSON	, and possi - bly
Marvell	PERSON	.

		Shakespeare in
Hamlet	LOCATION	and lago ,
Webster	PERSON	in
Bosola	LOCATION	and Ferdinand , gave us complete figures illuminated by the same searching metaphys - ic .

		Shelley , had he developed in the direction of The
Cenci	PERSON	and of
The Triumph of Time	ORGANIZATION	, might have become one of the great metaphysical poets .

		To turn from these figures to a writer of the present day and generation may seem to some an impertinence .

		But we are not able to estimate the weight and significance of a writer such as
Conrad Aiken	PERSON	, either as poet or as critic of poetry , except by making some such transition .

		On the jacket of Mr.
Aiken	PERSON	's latest book , his fifth -LRB- The Charnel Rose ; Four Seas Co. ;
Boston	LOCATION	-RRB- , I find the following : '' There is a strangeness about the art of
Conrad Aiken	PERSON	that makes it unique .

		No one is writing just like him in
America	LOCATION	today . ''

		This remark is not only true , it is probably the one - true thing that has ever been said about
Aiken	PERSON	.

		And because of this strangeness , which I think springs from the fact that both in his poetry and in his prose criticism
Aiken	PERSON	is a metaphysician , he has been more variously esti - mated by writers and critics on both sides of the At - lantic than any man I know .

		He is profoundly dis - liked by many , mistrusted by some , and admired , if at all , by a few .

		I turn to page thirty-one of the poem he calls Senlin : A Biography -LRB- really I like to think that the subject of this poem is
Aiken	LOCATION	himself -RRB- and cull the following stanzas : It is morning ,
Senlin	PERSON	says , and in the
morning	TIME	When the light drips through the shutters like the dew , I arise , I face the sunrise , And do the things my fathers learned to do .

		Stars in the purple dusk above the roof-tops Pale in a saffron mist and seem to die , And I myself on a swiftly tilting planet Stand before a glass and tie my tie .

		I stand before a mirror and comb my hair ; How small and white my face !

		The green earth tilts through a sea of air , And bathes in a flame of space .

		It is morning ,
Senlin	PERSON	says , and in the morning Should I not pause in the light to remember God ?

		Upright and firm I stand on a star unstable , He is immense and lonely as a cloud .

		I will dedicate this moment before my mirror To Him alone , for Him I will comb my hair .

		Accept these humble offerings , cloud of silence !

		I will think of you as I descend the stair .

		Here we have a kind of poetry profoundly un - settling of our cherished conventions and prejudices .

		1919 THE DIAL 559 Either we are by nature timid anthropomorphists in matters of religion -LRB- despite all the evidence that can be urged to the contrary -RRB- or we are simply indiffer - ent .

		But
Aiken	PERSON	is neither .

		He `` looks beneath the surface of age-old compromises and sees the body of Everyman poised on an unstable helpless planet , carefully arranging his tie , while his soul , darkened and without knowledge , humbly seeks to penetrate to the cause of all things .

		The cruel clarity of such perception as this startles and horrifies .

		But none , the less it is both beautiful and true .

		In this mind we find all our minds mirrored .

		Poetry can not do more .

		Even more profoundly disturbing , more intoxicat - ingly daemonic , is the insight displayed in the poem which gives this volume its title The Charnel Rose .

		The subject of this poem is sexual desire ; and out of desire , the '' desire of the moth for the star , '' the desire that has tormented every great mind from
Saint Augustine	LOCATION	to
Nietzsche	LOCATION	,
Aiken	PERSON	has woven a vast symphony .

		Quotation here is useless .

		We are simply upborne in these mad , delirious waves of drunken music that flow in and out endlessly .

		We are hurried from one chaos into another , so that we should be in danger of losing our bearings utterly were not the mind and voice directing this orchestra that of a poet . ''

		To shape this world of leaderless ghostly passions , or else be mobbed by it , that is the question '' : in these lines is summed up the whole purpose of the poem .


Conrad Aiken	PERSON	has shaped this world for us , has striven to make tangible to us the intangible substance of our lives , and we can not withhold from him a meed of praise as great as that of any poet living and writing in
America	LOCATION	today .

GOULD FLETCHER	ORGANIZATION	.


Rainer Maria Rilke	PERSON	V-tHiEF AMONG THE LYRICAL gem makers of Ger - many at present is
Rainer Maria Rilke	PERSON	.

		He makes little perfect things after the patterns of old great things .

		Taking an intimate , poignant , but minute impress of a ` great emotion or intimation , he gives out an attenuated copy of it wrought in exquisite miniature workmanship .

		His talent burns with an intense but thin flame , a flame assuming a semblance of many colors from the many objects over which it plays , but having little color of its own .

		The paucity of inner warmth and substance is covered by much outward sense imagery wrapped in a symbolistic haze of unutterable mean - ings .

		The attitude of the Annunciation becomes a habit .

		The vatic gesture serves as a vehicle of any communication no matter how casual , trivial , or merely pretty .

		A breathless anticipation of eternal beauty and heavenly preciousness exhales a strained atmosphere of a sublimity both exclusive and pre - carious .

		Sense intoxication , immensely skilful and self-conscious , counterfeits vision .

		Though he developed separately , he is in a sense the extreme efflorescense of the movement which took definite form and set forth a precise program under the leadership of
Stephan George	PERSON	in Die
Blatter	PERSON	fiir die Kunst , during the nineties .

		That magazine was for a time the organ of an esoteric poetical brother - hood of excruciating sensitiveness and finesse .

		The brotherhood has passed , but the spirit has remained .

		Its devotees repudiate whatever is readily perceptible to the common .

		The impact of reality upon the mind is by them removed to the extreme limits of the aura of crepuscular intimations fringing the sphere of normal perception .

		Their consciousness spurns the ministrations of the naked sense .

		Emo - tion and sense-life are sustained by a high-power microscope .

		The German movement is not an isolated sport in the poetry and art of nineteenth century
Europe	LOCATION	.

		It took a decided form first in the Romantic Move - ment in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		It rose again in the French Symbolists and in some of the Neo-Celts , and is now seeking rebirth in the Imagists .

		It is closely asso - ciated with the musical and pictorial arts , especially the latter , from which it borrows much of its tech - nique of the reproduction of the world of the eye .

		It seeks to mirror nature in a consciousness one - sidedly visual , and , to a lesser degree , auditory .

		Its chief shortcoming lies in the poverty of its in - ner life .

		Its emotionality is subtle sense excitement .

		Its spirituality is an exquisite mask of the utmost re - finements of a rarified animalism .

		Its ethos is a sensuality from which has been refined away its proper relevance , its matter-of-fact gravity and downright honest desire for material fruitfulness .

		What remains is an intense but impoverished gesture of creativeness .

		The attitude of the recording self in this poetry is that of a spellbound inactivity , of a breathless , pass - ively intense waiting for the spontaneous arrival of t ^ he unutterable , which , like the king in
Maeter	LOCATION	- linck 's Seven Princesses , never comes .

		It lacks the nai 've identification of the conscious self with the impulses , motions , and activities swaying it , which is the essence of the mood of true lyricism .

		Its in - ward quality is largely that of prose which is meas - 560 THE DIAL
May 31	DATE	ured by the degree to which the recording conscious - ness keeps clear of the sway of the activities , emo - tions , and ideas transmitted through it .

		Its emo - tional participation in its subjects is that peculiar introspective mood in which self-conscious gesture takes the place of nai 've utterance . ''

		I will pour forth my soul with hands stretched out '' is the con - cluding and culminating line of The Bride .

		True lyricism is not introspective .

		The irrelevance of mere visual finesse intruding on the essential mood is shown in the characteristic last stanza of the poem Memories from Childhood .

		The poet remembers the sweetness of his boyhood , glorified as it was by the companionship of a gifted and sympathetic mother , who used to play and sing to him .

		The picture concludes : His large eyes fastened with a quiet glow Upon the hand which by her ring seemed bent , And slowly wandering o'er the white keys went Moving as though against a drift of snow .

		Such self-mirroring as in the first line , and the eyes ' search for unusual and strained refinements of ex - ternal analogy in the remaining lines , destroy sin - cerijy of emotion and freeze lyrical warmth .

		.

		However , with all its shortcomings of externalism and inner sterility , this poetry has a claim on our attention as an expression of a type of individuality developed by modern civilization and as a conspicu - ous feature of the literary life of a century .

		And
Rilke	PERSON	, as one of the most distinguished representa - tives of this type , both in substance and workman - ship , will repay careful reading with many subtle thrills , many suggestions , and many admissions to modern emotional sophistication .

		These remarks on Rilke have been called forth by translations of a selection from his many books of poems by
Jessie Lemont	PERSON	-LRB-
Tobias A. Wright	PERSON	;
New York	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		In view of the immense difficulties of her task , she has acquitted herself with remarkable fidelity and a considerable degree of success .

		Aside from the common difficulties of metrical translitera - tion from German into English difficulties inher - ent in the far greater number of unstressed final syllables and the greater rhythmical weight of un - stressed syllables generally she had to contend with the obstacles , often insuperable , raised by the author 's exquisite verbal skill and by his preciosity .

		Fre - quently , with the illusive veil of the latter torn by the exigencies of English , there appears the naked prose of the matter , as in lines like : '' He will awake , will read , will letters write , '' in which the inversion crudely emphasizes the uninspired con - tent .

		Harshness of sound and rhythm , inadequate renderings of subtleties of matter and diction are unavoidable .

		Yet , to those to whom
Rilke	PERSON	in the original is inaccessible and to those sympathetically interested in the suggestions gained from comparison of metrical translations with their originals , the book will prove valuable .

		The translations are prefaced by an illuminating though somewhat panegyrical appreciation of Rilke , by `` H. T. ''
MARTIN SCHUTZE	PERSON	.

		B The Romance of the Realists ' E HE NEVER so STERN a realist , the poet must yet obey his romantic spirit .

		For poetry is distin - guished from prose by a desire that broods upon its own activity , returning upon itself as a lapsed wave is caught up and carried forward by the sea .

		It is this that renders the subject-matter of poetry indif - ferent .

		Any subject is '' poetic '' which the artist can invest with his personal ardor .

		It is '' prosaic '' to the degree that he intellectualizes , that he resists its immediate claim upon him for the sake of imposing a more considered accent .

		That toward which the artist 's instinct drives him is '' poetic '' ; that which he accepts , as an object for the exercise of his technic or the play of his intelligence , is to this extent the subject matter of prose .

		Primitive poetic impulse seems to be toward a perception of the external world .

		The mind of the poet , playing in the vague childhood of the race , dis - covers earth and air , the seas and the planets , with wonder and delight .

		It is only later that he discov - ers his own personality , and , as he progresses , the in - volution of that personality with a complex and in - apprehensible world .

		Much of the poetry at the close of the last century was the poetry of men defeated by the coils in which they found them - selves , fooling with surface fripperies and fra - grances .

		What marks contemporary English poetry is its preoccupation with the personal , a preoccupa - tion stimulated and directed by the increased com - plexity of our life .

		It is not so much that the splen - dor of a sunlit wind-ridden earth or the terror of space and thunder have lessened , as that the prob - lems we have more frequently to face are those of one personality impinging on others ; and moreover that we have new knowledge about personal rela - tions no less revolutionary than the new knowledge about impersonal ones which shook the mid-nine - teenth century .

		Inasmuch as the majority of her poems deal with this novel world ,
Jean Starr Untermeyer	PERSON	is a mod - ern person .

		All art is to a degree pathological .

		It is a means of throwing off waste emotion .

		It is
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 561 medicine for the sick soul .

		So she makes her frank declaration : Not for Art 's sake , But to rid me of an ancient sorrow .

		And since to the sensitive mind the knowledge of its own loneliness is always intensely present , it is here her emphasis lies .

		If she dwells upon the soul 's essential solitude , however , it is without sentimental - ity and often with a stringent challenge .

		The authenticity of Growing Pains -LRB-
Huebsch	PERSON	-RRB- lies in the poet 's surrender to her mood .

		A surrender which is yet not an abandonment , which is con - trolled by the cleverness of the technician as well as by the author 's realistic bias .

		Here are '' no songs for an idle lute . ''

		If this seems a bold statement , an examination of the poems gives it validity .

		Not all have the same highly-wrought quality , but all seem to have been evoked by the pressure of life itself , by the demands of body and brain .

		The power of investing vulgar experience with beauty is patent in the color and odorous pungency of
Autumn	LOCATION	; in the mellow gravity of A Man ; in On the
Beach	LOCATION	, with its sure resurgent cadences , the infibulation of human passions with the vast heave and murmur of the sea ; in
Spring	DATE	, perhaps the most sustained poem in the book , certainly one of the most penetrat - ing .

		There is little verbal music in these poems , despite the author 's fine rhythmic sense .

		She cares rather for a word 's adequacy than for its resonance .

		But her work has the virtues of that defect .

		For the sheer power of its imagery , no less than for its characteristic ironic vigor , High-Tide is fairly typical : I edged back against the
night	TIME	.

		The sea growled assault on the wave-bitten shore .

		And the breakers , Like young and impatient hounds , Sprang , with rough joy on the shrinking sand .

		Sprang but were drawn back slowly , With a long , relentless pull ,
Whimpering	LOCATION	, into the dark .

		Then I saw who held them captive ; And I saw how they were bound With a broad and quivering leash of light , Held by the moon , As , calm and unsmiling , She walked the deep fields of the sky .

		In contrasting this with another first book , that of Alter
Brody	PERSON	A Family Album -LRB- Heubsch -RRB- one comes to a sharper realization of those quali - ties which make a poet out of a realist .

		For while he has a kinship with the maturer artist , the lack of her restraint and sophistication sometimes twists his sincerest efforts into a blurred and pensive sen - timentality .

		His book is a confusion of power and weakness : the power of a harsh veracity and irony , the weakness of youth brooding over love and death .

		For Mrs.
Untermeyer	PERSON	's acute self-analysis Mr.
Brody	PERSON	substitutes a more objective if less keen appre - hension of his environment .

		He is more nation - ally minded than the other poet , he is at once more self-conscious and less concentrated .

		He lingers on his racial affiliations ; dwelling on the Russian village with its '' sweet-sounding , time-scented name '' where he was born , and upon the
New York Ghetto	LOCATION	to which he came , with the same fond accent , the same receptive lucidity .

		In the Ghetto twilight he regards the old tenements , Watching the tired faces coming home from work , Like dry-breasted hags - Welcoming their children to their withered arms .

		And he asks : Is that ugly ?

		That dreamy-eyed little ragamuffin urinating so contem - platively on the pavement , Patterning that square patch of sunlight into circles and ellipses With such intense absorption Fearlessly , They thrust their dry branches against the sky ; Long since the wind rifled their blossoms And scattered their foliage on the ground Now they stand sternly erect , Naked and strong , Having nothing to lose .

		Mr.
Brody	PERSON	simply asserts himself to be a realist .

		Understanding the demands such a philosophy of art puts upon the poet , he strives unremittingly to fulfill them .

		There are many lapses and immaturities ; he is often verbose ; and sometimes his verse moves in the alert progressive rhythms of prose rather than the strophic curves of his chosen art .

		But there is the note of a significant voice here .

		Without any expressed theory , Mrs.
Untermeyer	PERSON	achieves what Mr.
Brody	PERSON	seeks .

		In spite of a more limited and delayed output , perhaps because of it , she comes more nearly to the core of poetic realism .

		Both poets deal with familiar things , finding their themes in the homely street , the common face , the eventualities of the day .

		Both prefer the use of un - rhymed free verse , probably for its greater strict - ness and terseness .

		Of the two , Mr.
Brody	PERSON	is more apt to bejewel his verse with lovely phrases than to startle with ^ the unequivocal adjective .

		The fact that Mrs.
Untermeyer	PERSON	succeeds more frequently seems to be due rather to strenuous self-criticism than to any fundamental difference in attack .

		Ca - pacity to see the beauty in things common and grotesque , the grasp upon and plumbing of experi - ence with the courage of the intellect , these are the hallmarks of their method , as well as the gifts of their art '
BABETTE DEUTSCH	PERSON	.

		562 THE DIAL
May 31	DATE	The Cult of Brutality 1 T is A COMMON PLATITUDE that every extreme , from politics to literature breeds its own violent antithesis .

		Yet , familiar though the axiom may be and numerous though its examples are , it is always a fresh fascination to watch its workings in a new movement in art , a new ethnic cause , a renewed dispute in literary esthetics .

		Literature partic - ularly records these swings of the pendulum with an almost mathematical regularity .

		From the rude vigor of the Elizabethans to the polished artifice of Pope , from the pietistic elegance of
Vaughan	PERSON	and
Herbert	PERSON	to the straightforward simplicity of the Lake poets , one can trace the reactions not only of poetry , but of the age that produced it .

		In our own time we see the preponderant swing toward a free but earth-planted naturalism .

		The revulsion from a purely decorative literature , from mere verbal color and esthetic adroitness , has brought about work of the most opposite sort ; the return -LRB- foretold by
Synge	PERSON	-RRB- to brutality as a fresh starting-point is one of its outstanding results .

		We witness it in Eng - land in the narratives of
Masefield	ORGANIZATION	, in the miniature dramas of
W. W. Gibson	PERSON	, in certain phases of the poetry of
Rupert Brooke	ORGANIZATION	,
Siegfried Sassoon	PERSON	, and other young Georgians .

		In
America	LOCATION	, thanks possibly to the still predominating Puritan tradition , the re - action has been slower and less pervasive .

		But it already has its protagonists .

		We see its manifesta - tions in the work of
Carl Sandburg	PERSON	; in certain of the ruder passages of
Edgar Lee Masters	ORGANIZATION	,
Arturp Giovannitti	PERSON	,
Wallace Gould	PERSON	; in some of the street pictures of
Roy Helton	PERSON	.

		And now , with a brutal intensity of his own , comes
John Crowe Ransom	PERSON	with his first volume innocently entitled Poems About God -LRB- Holt -RRB- .

		The title itself is misleading .

		Even the author 's prefatory advertisement conceals the book 's harsh anger , its fierce humor .

		In his prologue , written in
France	LOCATION	, Mr.
Ransom	PERSON	says : The first three or four poems that I ever wrote -LRB- that was two years ago -RRB- were done in three or four different moods and with no systematic design .

		I was therefore duly surprised to notice that each of them made con - siderable use of the term God .

		I studied the matter a little , and came to the conclusion that this was the most poetic of all terms possible ; was a term always being called into requisition during the great moments of the soul , now in tones of love , and now indignantly ; and was the very last word that a man might say when standing in the presence of that ultimate mystery to which all our great experiences reduce .

		Wishing to make my poems as poetic as possible , I simply likened myself to a diligent apprentice and went to work to treat rather systematically a number of the occasions on which this term was in use with common American men .

		And since these occasions fairlv crowded into mind even at the most casual inventory , I also likened myself to a sovereign and a chooser ; and I very quickly ruled that I should consider only those situations as suitable in which I could imagine myself pronouncing the name God sincerely and spontaneously , never by that way of routine which is death to the esthetic and religious emotions .

		What is misleading about these ingratiating sen - tences is the emphasis that is put on a subject which is dropped time and again -LRB- usually to the volume 's advantage -RRB- , an emphasis which is likely to lead to a false appraisal .

		For Mr.
Ransom	PERSON	is less concerned with the whims , turns , and injustices of an anthro - pomorphic deity than he is in the use of God as good material .

		In spite of his honest protestation , Mr.
Ransom	PERSON	delights in employing his Creator -LRB- or rather , his creation -RRB- for artistic effects ; he uses him to tighten up a phrase , to round a rhyme , to raise a dull narrative to a higher or more dramatic pitch .

		When he forgets his program altogether , he succeed , s with far greater ease .

		Thus the poem , One Who Rejected Christ , drags in a sacred allusion by the very hair of its head .

		Its actual impulse is far from a spiritual one .

		Instead of religious indignation or ministerial unction there is a hard , bucolic satire that ends : I 'm not like other farmers , I make my farming pay ; I never go in for sentiment , And seeing that roses yield no rent I cut the stuff away .

		A very good thing for farmers If they would learn my way ; For crops are all that a good field grows , And nothing is worse than a sniff of rose In the good strong smell of hay .

		The whole volume bristles with this acerbity , a pungence often carried to an unusually bitter climax .

		Mr.
Ransom	PERSON	pursues , with remorseless vigor , a stark honesty , a bitter truth ; he cares little whether his frank expressiveness startles the unprepared or disgusts the squeamish .

		Examine Grace , with its brusque blend of beauty and ugliness .

		Here he has dramatically evoked the partners plowing , the hired hand who prayed '' to live in the sunshine of His face '' and -LRB- through `` an overdose of grace '' -RRB- col - lapsed underneath the broiling sun , the contrast of the man dying in the midst of his vomit and the calm setting with its half-ironic loveliness .

		Dumb - Bells is scarcely less effective , with its blunt cartoon of thirty fat men `` reducing '' : Dripping sweat and pumping blood They try to make themselves like God .

		In A
Christmas Colloquy	ORGANIZATION	there is less roughness ; a quieter if somewhat too extended irony points the

		And in poems like Wrestling -LRB- as by a coarser
Robert Frost	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Prayer , Noonday ,
Grace	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- with its gustatory catalogue -RRB- , and Geometry the original candor mounts with a stronger individuality .

		A fragment from the last-named may illustrate : My window looks upon a wood That stands as tangled as it stood When God was centuries too young To care how right he worked , or wrong , His patterns in obedient trees ; Unprofited by the centuries He still plants on as crazily As in his drivelling infancy .

		Small though the range may be , Mr.
Ransom	PERSON	's manner is varied enough .

		^ The lines run from the surprisingly powerful to the incredibly banal , from epithets that are forceful to phrases that are both flatulent and flat .

		Nor are the crudities confined to his treatment ; they often bury his racy lines in a flood of cheap philosophizing couched in a wearying meter .

		Mr.
Ransom	PERSON	is fond , for instance , of ring - ing many changes -LRB- not too skilfully -RRB- on a single over-stressed rhyme and , betrayed by a rather in - sensitive ear , he commits still further musical atrocities .

		This tone-deafness allows him to perpe - trate rhymes as false as those employed by the School of Popular Songs for One-Fingered Pianists `` rhymes '' as vaudevillian as `` girl world , '' `` down ground , '' `` way parley . ''

		His hext book will doubtless eliminate such gaucheries .

		It is to be hoped that the growing sophistication hinted at in the first paragraph of his introduction will not over - refine a gift that has , for all its rawness , individual - ity , strength , and the promise of stronger things .


Louis UNTERMEYER	PERSON	.


London	LOCATION	,
May 10	DATE	I AM NOT SURE whether a change in the editor - ship of the
Times	ORGANIZATION	is a matter which directly con - cerns literature .

		Perhaps it does , and in any case it is always interesting .

		In this particular case it is even more interesting than usual .

		The retiring editor , Mr.
Geoffrey Dawson	PERSON	-LRB- ne
Robinson	PERSON	-RRB- , has allowed it to be known that he has resigned because he feels that Lord Northcliffe is dissatisfied with him .

		And Lord Northcliffe is dissatisfied , he imagines , because of the divergence between the policy pursued by the Times and that pursued by the other journals under his lordship 's control .

		This divergence may have been for years a source of irri - tation to Lord Northcliffe and of pride , mixed perhaps with apprehension , to Mr.
Dawson	PERSON	; but the knowledge that it existed will probably ` come , as a surprise to the general public .

		Mr.
Winston Churchill	PERSON	years ago , when he was a member of a Liberal cabinet , remarked in the
House	ORGANIZATION	of Com - mons that he was not moved by what appeared in the
Daily Mail	ORGANIZATION	, whether in its halfpenny or its threepenny edition ; and it has always been supposed that the difference of general purpose between the Times and
the Daily Mail	ORGANIZATION	was much what might be supposed to exist between a fifteen-inch howitzer and a field-gun .

		Both took their part in the artil - lery preparation of any position which Lord North - cliffe desired to storm .

		But this being so , the difference which
Lord Northcliffe	ORGANIZATION	's control has made to the Times has been in one direction surprisingly small .

		In the di - rection of successful management it has of course been great ; but even those persons who prophesied the collapse of its prestige under the new regime are still obliged to admit , whether they will or not , that it is our first paper .

		I have heard many surprising results ascribed to the change in its ownership .

		I have heard it said that the whole course of our war administration would have been changed ; that the
Asquith Government	ORGANIZATION	would not have fallen ; that Mr.
Lloyd George	PERSON	would not have become Prime Minister ; and that , according to the views , of the speaker the war would either have been won earlier or not at all if Lord Northcliffe had not secured effective control before the war began .

		On these points I offer no opinion .

		But I am certainly of the opinion that , whatever may be the use to which the prestige of the paper is put , its prestige remains very much the same .

		The persons who describe the Daily Mail as the worst influence in our public life and who .

		believe that the
Times	ORGANIZATION	is merely the in - strument of the creator of the Daily Mail , continue to rely on the Times as the ultimate court of appeal so far as news is concerned .

		Perhaps the subtle divergence of policy , percepti - ble only to Lord Northcliffe and to Mr.
Dawson	PERSON	, has done this without our being aware of how it is done ; and the appointment of Mr. H !


Wickham Steed	PERSON	as editor may be the beginning of the end .

		In five years perhaps , by one of those Napoleonic changes to which Lord Northcliffe is addicted , it may suddenly appear as the first morning paper entirely devoted to colored pictures ; and a link with the past will be gone .

		But somehow I do not really anticipate that .

		I give Lord Northcliffe credit for being the greatest journalistic genius this country has ever produced ; and I imagine hjs genius is capable of understanding the mechanics of the Times as well as those of 5 6 4 THE DIAL
May 31	DATE	Answers or Comic Cuts .

		Mr.
Steed	PERSON	, besides , is a highly respectable journalist , who is believed to understand the Jugo-Slav question .

		I am sure he will not be a party to anything vulgar or rash .

		Meanwhile what we are all anxious about is the fate of the
Times Literary Supplement	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is a quite separate paper , not given away with the Times , but it is under the same management and equally subject to the nod of our journalistic
Jupiter	ORGANIZATION	.

		It has nevertheless pursued a policy distinctly diver - gent from that of its owner 's other papers ; and it has been acclaimed as the most telling opponent of Northcliffism extant .

		It is not perhaps guite that , because it preaches for the most part to the con - verted ; but it is a very distinguished upholder of liberty and the humanities , including among its con - tributors that almost excessively idealistic writer , Mr.
A. Glutton Brock	PERSON	.

		One has wondered for a long time why his lordship stood it ; and indeed one might imagine that he would be anxious to suppress it on other grounds than those of policy .

		It has long dull articles about ideals , and for the rest is made up of correspondence on the text of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and the principles of English prosody and of pages on pages of reviews of books , most of which probably seem to Lord Northcliffe as unreadable as the books themselves would be .

		It is generally supposed that only the amazing , inexplicable fact of its continued success , witnessed by unimpeachable circulation figures , has hitherto held his hand ; but no one knows how long this will continue .

		Therefore when any change overtakes the Times , we all feel a little nervous about the
Times Literary Supplement	ORGANIZATION	.

		I came across this question of circulation enter - tainingly the other day in another circle of ideas .

		Mr.
Monro	PERSON	, the founder and proprietor of the Poetry Bookshop , is in a semi-demobilized condition and is applying himself to the resumption of affairs .

		As a result he discovered , I understand , that Mr. De la Mare now leads the field and that Mr. -LRB- whose name I wo n't mention , because I think it not so creditable to us -RRB- is an honorable second .

		Poetry hath her best-sellers no less than fiction and , I suppose , always had , even when
Swinburne	PERSON	limped first past the post with an edition of 600 copies , 400 for sale in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		But if it is now a more sub - stantial thing than it was to be a best-seller among the poets , some of the credit for that happy fact must go to Mr.
Monro	PERSON	.

		He founded the Poetry Bookshop in
1912	DATE	an important year , the year after the publication of
Rupert Brooke	ORGANIZATION	's first volume .

		He founded it to meet the very real difficulty caused by the fact that a person who wanted in those days to buy a book of verse often failed unless he had great persistence and a profound expert knowledge of J : he publishing trade .

		The ordinary bookseller met all inquiries with a perfect ignorance and a sullen determination not to help .

		If you supplied him with the fullest details of publisher and price , he would still meditate for months on the desirability of allowing such dangerous stuff to pass through his shop .

		Of course he never in any circumstances stocked it .

		All this was changed by the Poetry Bookshop , where -LRB- broadly speaking -RRB- they stocked nothing else ; and I think that the future historian of English literature will mark
1912	DATE	as a turning-point .

		I do not mean that Mr.
Monro	PERSON	provoked a Renaissance by opening a shop , but I am of opinion that his enterprising -LRB- and as it has turned out , entirely successful -RRB- action was one of the most important of a number of symp - toms \ vhich began to be obvious at about the same time .

		In or about that year a new public interest in verse arose and , I think , the demand gave a cer - tain healthiness to the supply .

		It induces a more normal and more human state of mind to \ vrite what has a chance of pleasing than to produce in the void ; and poets who never thought of abandon - ing verse because it was unpopular really did begin to write a little better when they seemed to have a greater chance of a hearing .

		Someone said wistfully to me the other day -LRB- a poet of course -RRB- that he wished he could see a history of English literature written some hundred years hence .

		By Jove !

		So do I. I am convinced , and have always maintained , that we are indubitably at the beginning of what can only be called , in an un - comfortable term , a movement ; but I am certain that as yet we know very little of its eventual extent and character .

		Our view of it has changed a good deal in the six years that have passed since the ap - pearance of
Rupert Brooke	ORGANIZATION	and the first volume of Georgian Poetry and the foundation of the Poetry Bookshop .

		Reputations have risen and declined .

		New promise has appeared .

		The works of Mr. De la Mare sell briskly .

		It is a curious and entertain - ing world ; and I do wish that I could live for - ever .

ROBERT MORSS LOVETT	PERSON	, Editor
CLARENCE BRITTEN	PERSON	In Charge of the Reconstruction Program :
JOHN DEWEY THORSTEIN VEBLEN HELEN MAROT	PERSON	TH .

		HE TREATY WITH
GERMANY	LOCATION	SHOULD BE summarily rejected by the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is contrary to the view of world peace laid down by President
Wilson	PERSON	both before and after the
United States	LOCATION	entered the war .

		It is in specific violation of the fourteen points and hence of the terms of the Armis - tice .

		It is opposed to the theory of the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	and commits such a league to the defense and administration of territorial and economic ar - rangements which are wrong in principle and im - possible in practice .

		The treaty should be rejected as a matter of national honor , of national safety , and of national service to the world .

		Such rejec - tion will undoubtedly give opportunity for a better peace a peace of honor , generosity , and mutual ad - vantage between
Germany	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	.

		It may have the same effect on the peace between
Germany	LOCATION	and her other enemies .

		Far from hav - ing a modifying influence on the exactions of the Allies , the presence of the
United States	LOCATION	in their ranks has apparently given them confidence to de - mand terms which but for our guarantee would be obviously impossible .

		Our withdrawal from the Conference at this time is likely therefore to con - tribute to an earlier stabilization of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		And in any event the freedom of the
United States	LOCATION	from responsibility for the present Treaty is a necessary condition of its support and participation in a genuine international organization of the world , the necessity for which will be greater than ever .

		15 Y AND LARGE THE TERMS OF THE GREAT PEACE were drawn to secure two objects ; one offensive the destruction of
Germany	LOCATION	; one defensive the pre - servation of the present economic and political sys - tem .

		Obviously it was impossible to destroy all of
Germany	LOCATION	.

		It is less obvious , but equally true , that in the process of destroying a part of
Germany	LOCATION	the Allies have breached the defenses of the old order .

		In the long run , it makes little difference whether the German government signs the Treaty or not .

		If the Treaty is rejected , the Allies will enforce its terms without the aid of German official machinery .

		If the government accepts the Treaty , the Allies will for the time being have the aid of a German executive organism obedient to their wishes .

		In the first case the Entente governments will very shortly find themselves dealing directly and at once with the '' kept classes '' of
Germany	LOCATION	, , who will collect the required tribute from the masses of the population .

		In the second case , the officials will form an additional class of intermediaries between the Germans who produce and the Allies who claim the product .

		But the governing and owning classes of
Germany	LOCATION	already rock in the storms of revolution .

		To insure the final and complete overthrow of both , it only remained for the Allies to make the position of official or capitalist not worth fighting for .

		And in this the statesmen have succeeded admirably .

		The terms are indeed '' ruinous '' they will ruin the two intermediary classes in
Germany	LOCATION	and iron the population out into decentralized socialism .

		When this has been accomplished , the burdens laid upon
Germany	LOCATION	will rest , not -LRB- as is usual -RRB- upon tax - collecting classes that profit in spite of burdens , but directly upon the flat masses of the German people .

		Whether the capitalist system caused the war is a somewhat academic question .

		Certainly it made the peace a peace with terms so heavy that Ger - man capitalism will be crushed out of existence , and the subject classes of
Germany	LOCATION	will be united in a hatred born of nationalistic rebellion and the class war .

		This animosity will have for its object the foreign '' kept classes '' whose only capitalistic func - tion , as far as
Germany	LOCATION	is concerned , is the absorp - tion of profits .

		Here , then , for the first time the class that owns and the class that works appear in the undecorated roles of the taxer and the taxed .

		Whether or not this reductio ad absurdum of the old order will have an appreciable effect upon the taxed classes in the allied countries remains to be seen .

		Already it seems safe to predict that allied and German labor will find friendship in adversity .

		All this escapes those critics who seize upon the easiest interpretation of the Treaty and , find the Allies in danger of killing the German goose that is expected to lay the golden eggs of indemnity .

		The figure does not go far enough .

		The real goose is an international bird ; as long as labor and brain power in
Germany	LOCATION	and elsewhere are organized foi production incident to the preservation of life , the goose lives .

		It is the system for collecting the eggs that is everywhere in danger .

		5 66 THE DIAL 1 HE CHIEF USE OF A LEAGUE OF NATIONS FOR the great silent majority of the earth should be as a form of liquidation for empires in esse and in posse , to release the millions of
India	LOCATION	,
Egypt	LOCATION	, and
Ireland	LOCATION	from British and the millions of
Korea	LOCATION	from
Japan	LOCATION	- ese dominion to save the millions of
China	LOCATION	, Rus - sia , and
Africa	LOCATION	from threatening imperialistic am - bitions .

		The great danger of the Covenant , as was promptly seen by its advocates , was in Article X which seemed in effect to validate existing empires .

		The final arrangements preliminary to the Treaty , and the Treaty itself , give no comfort to those who hoped for the first and feared the second .

		The case of
Ireland	LOCATION	is the most advanced of those of nations seeking self-government .

		Sir
Edward Carson	PERSON	has forbidden
Lloyd George	PERSON	to receive the
American Commission	ORGANIZATION	sent to raise the Irish question at the
Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	.

		The English occupation of
Egypt	LOCATION	is the most outstanding case of international treach - ery on the part of a European nation .

		At the bid - ding of the Egyptian bondholders , English guns were turned on
Alexandria	LOCATION	in
1882	DATE	and the prom - ising nationalistic movement under
Arabi Pasha	PERSON	was crushed .

		The English government promised solemnly in the sight of all
Europe	LOCATION	to withdraw from
Egypt	LOCATION	.

		After continuing its occupation for thirty - two years , it declared a protectorate over
Egypt	LOCATION	in
1914	DATE	.

		For nearly five years the
United States	LOCATION	re - fused formal recognition of this act .

		Only a few days ago President
Wilson	PERSON	's complacency triumphed over his conscience ; he accepted the protectorate , adding a little pious piffle to the Egyptians about the folly of their attempts at self-determination .

		The whole of
India	LOCATION	is a burning , seething sore .

		Literally , millions are engaged in a demonstration against the economic exploitation of the country under British authority and particularly against the withdrawal of all civil rights from Hindus by the Rowlatt Acts .

		The voices of
Robert Williams	PERSON	,
Robert Smillie	PERSON	, and
George Lansbury	PERSON	are raised in their behalf in a call to their countrymen '' to join us in our protest against the bombing and shooting of unarmed men and women , and in our demand for a public in - quiry into these outrages . ''

		In this connection it is interesting to remember that
England	LOCATION	has always professed to hold
India	LOCATION	as trustee for the Indian people on the same principle as that implicit in the system of mandatories under the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is with little confidence in the light of the news from
Egypt	LOCATION	and
India	LOCATION	that we contemplate the pros - pect of handing the rest of
Africa	LOCATION	over to
England	LOCATION	as mandatory .

		The Japanese atrocities in
Korea	LOCATION	are likely to be duplicated in Shantung underwritten by President
Wilson	PERSON	, the
United States	LOCATION	, and the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	.

		The connection of this state of affairs throughout the world controlled by the Executive powers of the League with the future of
Germany	LOCATION	under the
Treaty	ORGANIZATION	is obvious .


Germany	LOCATION	is to take her place as the chief of the martyr nations - ^ the exponent of their wrongs , the leader in their plea for justice and in their movement for freedom .

		It would be another ironical turn of history that should make
Germany	LOCATION	the hope of freedom in the world , and enroll the nations that fought for liberty and self-determination , in a
League of Free Nations	ORGANIZATION	as misnamed as the
Holy Alliance	ORGANIZATION	.

		AODAY WALT WHITMAN IS ONE HUNDRED YEARS old .

		During the century since his birth his States have evolved a scene very different from that crude and spacious panorama , extending westward from a narrow selvage of provincial elegance to a fabulous frontier , which seems to us the congruous back - ground for his rugged figure .

		Yet we feel those of us who attend him at all that he was spiritually more nearly our contemporary than were any of the other men of letters whose centenaries we have lately celebrated or are soon to celebrate .

		Many of them represented , more easily and intimately per - haps than Whitman the poet ever represented any - thing , the textures of the particular segments of life that enclosed them ; but in a large loose way Whit - man the man increasingly typifies for us the general canvas of that life .

		At the same time , and even while the scene which he proclaimed as American recedes into a conveniently remote golden age in our nation - al consciousness , Whitman the prophet advances upon us as spokesman for what we like to think are our enduring ideals .

		No doubt this is the normal career for the prophet : his time melts into history as a single luminous page ; he himself is purged and canonized as its surviving hero .

		Now if there is any social validity in this prophet-making process , it is perhaps less futile than many think it to be to cull from the master 's works passages of plausible contemporary pertinence '' prophecies . ''

		Not that the prophet will actually have anticipated the con - ditions or events to which his words are thus ap - plied , but that he will enrich his readers ' desires and thoughts with something of the combined dig - nity and familiar warmth , of the clearer and closer community of purpose , that accrues from a continu - ing tradition and that no age can achieve for itself in isolation .

		Therefore it is not necessary to believe that when
Whitman	PERSON	wrote Years of the Modern he was predicting the kind of European war we have just passed through , or the sort of peace we are de - bating , or the Russian Revolution , or any fortunate sequels to any of these events , in order to warm our newer faith in freedom at the fire of his lines : What historic denouements are those we so rapidly approach ?

		I see men marching and countermarching by swift millions , I see the frontiers and boundaries of the old autocracies broken , I see the landmarks of European Kings removed , I see this day the people beginning their landmarks -LRB- all others give way -RRB- .

		What whispers are these , O lands , running ahead of you , passing under the seas !

		Are all nations communing ?

		...
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 567 w HY SHOULD NEARLY EVERYBODY INDULGE A conviction that he can write poetry ?

		Relatively few unequipped amateurs think themselves painters or sculptors or composers .

		Are the other arts pro- .

		tected from tyro invasion by the obvious recalci - trance of their media , while poetry , whose stuff is after all only the words that Everyman uses to transact his daily affairs , looks to be an easier busi - ness ?

		Whoever has to read manuscripts for a pub - lication which prints verse will be suspicious of that solution , for he will long since have become con - vinced that more unskilled pens attempt poetry than attempt fiction , drama , or criticism whose stuff is equally words and whose patterns look even easier to the unpracticed .

		Is it because rhythm is more funda - mental in us than the plastic impulse , and earlier de - mands its satisfaction ?

		The popularity of dancing , from the elaboration of new steps to the vogue for unskilled '' interpretive '' license , lends plausibility to that hypothesis .

		Yet music is also a rhythmic art , and drumming is easier to acquire than scan - sion why then are we not deafened by amateur drummers ?

		Finally , there is the notion that com - posing poetry is somehow a necessity to adolescence , like first love , which it almost universally accom - panies .

		If the will to unskilled versifying were only confined to the adolescent !

		Nevertheless one guesses that this notion looks in the right direction .

		For poetry , as
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	or somebody else has said , is essentially autobiographical ; and if the urge to talk about ourselves is acutest in adolescence , the itch lingers long in most of us .

		Poetry is intimate gossip sublimated , raised at its best to the rath power of intensity , and yet protected from a too raw curios - ity and the risk of indiscretion by the fact that it is poured into molds accepted by convention .

		All men want to talk about themselves as fully as they can with social safety ; therefore all men hanker to write poetry .

		Some are content to believe that rhyme is poetry , and produce the pallid invertebrate verse that is perhaps rifest in
New England	LOCATION	; others are persuaded that sentiment is also requisite , and flood the Southern newspapers with flowery wed - ding and funeral pieces ; the half-literate discover poetic diction , and drive magazine editors to drink ` early on
Monday	DATE
morning	TIME	; undergraduates make the acquaintance of sonnets , ballades , villanelles , and rondeaux , and polish off tracings that resemble poems much as tissue patterns resemble dresses .

		Ob - serving all of which , iconoclasts conclude that rhyme , meter , sentiment , poetic diction , and metrical pat - terns only hobble
Pegasus	ORGANIZATION	, and mount him bareback for free-versatile flights .

		Schools arise and stiffen '' lazy verse '' with new gear in place of the discarded harness .

		And shortly there is a '' poetic renaissance . ''

		HE MEN OF THE RED SPECIAL WHO WERE SAVED from deportation by the generous efforts of
Charles Recht	PERSON	and
Caroline A. Lowe	PERSON	, are now being re - leased from
Ellis Island	LOCATION	, penniless , three thousand miles from home .

		The government , under whose authority they were arrested , imprisoned , and brought to this city refused to accept any respon - sibility for returning them to their homes .

		If they had been convicted of crime and served sentence they would be entitled to transportation , but being innocent under the law they have no such claim .

		This monstrous injustice of the government must be made good by private charity .

		THE DIAL will receive contributions and see that they are used to enable the men to reach home .

		/ \ LETTER IN ANOTHER COLUMN GIVES A SPECIFIC instance of the atrocities committed by soldiers against their fellow citizens .

		We have repeatedly called attention to the refusal of the War Depart - ment to take any cognizance of such outrages , except where negro soldiers were involved , and to the offi - cial approval extended by the Adjutant General to persons inciting them .

		As the attack on The Call was alleged to be in support of the Victory Loan , protest was made to Secretary Glass .

		His reply is that of a true Southern gentleman .

		He deprecates lynching but refuses to hold the lynchers responsible .

		It is the '' incendiary '' nature of articles in The Call which is at fault , just as it might be the hideous na - ture of the crime of rape .

		He has no word of con - demnation for the men who acted as judge , jury , and executioner upon the offending newspaper no apology for his loan workers who egged them on .

		In this he merely repeats the attitude of his chief .

		Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	calls inciters to mob violence un-Amer - ican , but nevertheless continues to honor and trust them , as he will doubtless continue to honor and trust Mr. Glass .

		JVlANY READERS OF THE DlAL HAVE NOTED the omission of the price in connection with the titles of books reviewed .

		This is made necessary by a ruling of the
Third Assistant Postmaster General	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the mind ` of this functionary all reviews are in the nature of advertisements ; the only motive he can conceive for the mention of such a commodity as a book is to sell it ; and accordingly in his view the pages of this magazine devoted to reviews of books should be charged postage at the rate for advertising material and trade journals .

		He is willing to suspend this ruling , provided the price of the book is not mentioned .

		It is superfluous to point out that this interference with long-estab - lished custom is in line with the attitude of repres - sion for which the
Post Office Department	ORGANIZATION	has become noted .

		The only remedy we can suggest is that librarians and other readers who are inter - ested in price as well as the size of books send their protests directly to the Third Assistant Post - master General , or to their representatives at Wash - ington .

		5 68 THE DIAL
May 31	DATE	Communications ONE FUTURE FOR AMERICAN POETRY SIR : It would be difficult to ascertain whether the discussion of an art is usually a sign of its birth or of its dissolution .

		A corpse is most convenient for dissection .

		But in the case of American poetry it is almost unnecessary to remark that there has been as yet no body of verse worthy the name ; and since the awakening interest in such things , vouched for by their publication , can not indicate post - mortem curiosity , we can afford to assume that there is an immediate flowering in preparation for the submerged art in this country .

		Meanwhile , come what will , the discussions are stimulating and ex - hilarating , and especially so the clear-headed critical estimates of Mr.
Conrad Aiken	PERSON	, who , though a member of the craft , retains a delightfully un - ' partisan attitude toward the members of every school , group , and chorus .

		Yet it is impossible to please anybody all the time , and Mr.
Aiken	PERSON	's classi - fication of American poetry leaves me convinced and unsatisfied .

		Convinced as to the state of our poetical product , unsatisfied with the remedy offered .

		To Mr.
Aiken	PERSON	there seems a middle dish between vulgar sentimental sugar-candy and recondite pea - cock 's tongues ; the ham and eggs may I say of verse , appetizing , nourishing , and generally avail - able .

		He laments its absence from the American menu .

		In
Browning	PERSON	's words , `` the poets pour us wine , '' some so sweet that it sickens us , others of so condensed , complex , and occult a flavor that we take it puzzled , in tentative sips .

		The plea is for a medium grade , palatable but with body .

		One classification suggests another ; and when I came in the same hour upon Landor 's tribute to
Browning	PERSON	it occurred to me that in this poem lay the basis of another and truer division , applicable in almost every instance , and pointing to a possible poetical future in a country whose artists have shown a tendency toward clarity , conciseness , cleverness , and away from sentimentality :
Browning	PERSON	!

		Since Chaucer was alive and hale No man hath walked along our roads with step So active , so inquiring eye , or tongue So varied in discourse .

		The linking of these two names is impressive in itself .

		These are men outside the great tradition of English poetry , who strive , not after sensuous imagery , the purple patch , incense-breathing melody , but for intellectually stimulating analysis and glee - ful , ironical portraiture .

		English poetry has been dominated , from Spenser down , by all that is sweet and lovely in music , picture , and sentiment .

		Shake - speare , able to do as he pleased , finally threw his great weight into the scale on Spenser 's side , donned for his tragedies gorgeous trailing robes , and spoke in elegiac music .

		Milton is a high priest of har - mony ;
Wordsworth	PERSON	-LRB- at his best -RRB- ,
Blake	PERSON	,
Coleridge	PERSON	,
Keats	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	,
Tennyson	LOCATION	,
Swinburne	LOCATION	,
Rossetti	PERSON	utter the emotional and lyrical cry .

		But the appeal of Chaucer and
Browning	PERSON	, together with that of
Byron and Burns	PERSON	, at their highest , is based upon detached and philosophic observation of the human comedy .

		The characteristic works of these four men such as the Prologue , Fra
Lippo Lippi	PERSON	,
Don Juan	PERSON	, Tarn o ' Shanter indicate their attitude immediately .

		Keen , critical , humorous observers of human nature are they all , ` attempting other man - ners only at the risk of becoming rhetorical as witness Burns in his love songs .

		The grand divi - sion is in attitude .

		Spenser leads a group of poets who were in the main seekers after the beautiful , preeminently receptive and emotional .

		And Chau - cer , no less English , heads a smaller list of those who loved truth and its ironies , and an active intel - lect , more than the singing robes .

		Many of us are sick of that ubiquitous insipid sweetness which results from a too absolute sur - render to that main tradition of '' the light that never was on sea or land . ''

		The past glories of English poetry are largely due to the creation and re-creation of that light ; but the age and the land in which we live are too clear-eyed to appreciate the beautiful illusion .

		Many of us also have a prefer - ence for
Keats	PERSON	, but his purple is foreign to our garish day ; and an attempt to imitate him now is as futile and shallow as the piano reveries of ten years ago .

		Perhaps the future lies with those who are able to look at modern things in modern daylight , and who are willing to report them without throw - ing about them any glamour of age , distance , or exotic custom .

		In this realistic age all the old para - phernalia of romance , once so natural , spontaneous , and true , seems trashy and affected .

		The tinsel is frayed ; the tricks are stale .

New York City	LOCATION	.

		THE PATH ON THE RAINBOW SIR : I am asking for a little space in which to protest Mr.
Louis Untermeyer	PERSON	's review of the an - thology of American Indian verse in your issue of
March 8	DATE	.

		Or perhaps it amounts to a protest against giving a book of such national , one might say international interest to be reviewed by one whose mind has so evidently never visited west of Broadway .

		Mr.
Untermeyer	PERSON	describes himself as a '' mere man of letters , '' a more limiting title than I should have chosen for him , but it begins to be a question in
America	LOCATION	whether a man is entitled to describe himself as a man of letters at all who so compla - cently confesses his ignorance of and inability to enter into the vast body of aboriginal literature of his country , literature that rises to the saga form easily comparable to the great works on which
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean literature is built , and to epics that for sonority and richness of figure approach and at times equal the epics of Homer .

		That these treasures of native literature are not yet available in that easy edition de luxe which Mr.
Untermeyer	PERSON	appears to desire , is very largely due to the large number of persons who , like Mr.
Untermeyer	PERSON	, apparently can not get at literature in any other form .

		The movement , however , to aid the average American to under - stand what his own land has to say through the medium of a homogeneous race , will not be helped by making such reviews a mere statement of limita - tion .

		I agree with Mr.
Untermeyer	PERSON	that The Path on the Rainbow might have been acconjpanied by ex - planatory notes to the advantage of most readers .

		I may say here that the only thing that has pre - vented me from publishing such an edition of American verse , is the difficulty of finding a pub - lisher for anything that smacks of scholarship in that direction .

		But I feel that the failure to get anything out of the edition as it stands is wholly Mr.
Untermeyer	PERSON	's .

		It would be a great deal , for instance , to have fully established , as this volume does , that vers libre and Imagism are in truth primitive forms , and both of them generically Amer - ican forms , forms instinctively selected by people living in
America	LOCATION	and freed from outside influence .

		I feel quite sure that I said enough in the intro - duction to enable the thoughtful reader to discover that Imagism is an incomplete form , as recognized by the Indian , requiring melody and the beat of drum or pounding feet to fulfill itself .

		It should have been fruitful to the thoughtful poet to consider just how far the Indian could carry this form , as instanced in the
Marriage Song of Tiakens	ORGANIZATION	, which I am sure I could have passed off as Greek by the simple change of name .

		Even more interesting it is to note how stanza structure is built up out of the unrhymed , un - measured lyric , as is shown in the collection of songs from the
Southwest	LOCATION	.

		.

		And what a lot of discussion might be saved us if Mr.
Untermeyer	PERSON	could have made the observation which this volume suggests , and further inquiry could but confirm , about several things that Imagism is not .

		It is not , with the aboriginal , merely descriptive , and never merely decorative .

		The incident which the reviewer recounts as re - lated to him by Mr.
Robert Frost	PERSON	is ` true enough ; it may be found by the curious in
Burton	LOCATION	's Ojibway Songs , and since Mr.
Burton	PERSON	so frankly admits his error , he would not object to my saying that it is not the only mistaken translation he made .

		When one considers how many readings of Sappho and even of Shakespeare are in doubt , it is not surpris - ing that Indian verse should occasionally suffer at the hands of the translator .

		It is also true and ought not to seem surprising , as Mr.
Untermeyer	PERSON	suspects , that Indian poets are like other poets , occasionally banal and commonplace , but it is again pertinent to suggest that something more than a '' mere man of letters '' is required for the appreciation of literature which is different from one 's ow T n , or the fashion of the hour .

		It is not necessary to read banality into the par - ticular examples given by Mr.
Untermeyer	PERSON	, any morfe than one reads triviality into an army singing
John Brown	PERSON	's Body because the words are trivial .

		I did not translate the particular verse instanced by Mr.
Untermeyer	PERSON	, but what must always be taken into consideration behind Indian songs is democracy of thinking and feeling .

		The communal life of the Indian leads to a community of thinking which made many words unnecessary , made the words a
spring	DATE	for the release of emotion which might be anything but banal .

		Ten thousand American boys in a foreign land singing Home Sweet Home is a very moving thing , and twice ten Indians at the ragged
end of winter	DATE	, when the food goes stale and their very garments smell of wood smoke , singing the maple sugar song might sing a great deal of poetry into it , poetry of rising sap , clean snow water , call - ing partridge , and the friendly click of bass bowls and birch bark sap buckets .

		If Mr.
Untermeyer	PERSON	could get his mind off the Indian Anthology as a thing of type and paper ^ he might have got some - thing more out of it .

		He might even have launched into a dissertation on the horrible banality of poetry under complete democracy , and have further sup - ported it by turning over a few pages to songs of the
Southwest	ORGANIZATION	where everybody knows the abori - ginals live in terraced houses , and the stanza form advanced with the increase of privacy and individu - ality of living .

		No one who reads the Hako cere - mony of the Pawnees , realizing that the Pawnee country is open , rolling prairie , lifting toward long level mesas , can fail to be struck with the way in 57 THE DIAL
May 31	DATE	which the shape of the lines is influenced by the contours of the country .

		It was in order to show just such local influences that the poems in the An - thology were grouped sectionally rather than tribally .

		That all these things seem to have been missed by the reviewer raises again the question as to whether we can ever have anything which is American litera - ture , sui generis , until literary judgment begins to be American and leaves off being thoroughly

		THE SCHOOL PROBLEM IN
RUSSIA	LOCATION	SIR : In your issue of
April 19	DATE	under the title The Soviets and the Schools , Mr.
Lomonossoff	PERSON	gives a brief survey of recent educational reforms in
Russia	LOCATION	and concludes his article in the following words : '' But it is an enigma to me why both Provisional Governments overlooked the school problem . ''

		This conveys a false idea and leads the reader to believe that all the reforms mentioned in his article are to be attributed to the Bolshevik leaders .

		These are un - doubtedly also Mr.
Lomonossoff	PERSON	's views .

		The following facts will prove , however , that some of his assertions need revision .

		In the first place Mr.
Lomonossoff	PERSON	tries to im - press the reader with the fact that the secularization of schools is entirely the work of the Bolshevik school authorities .

		This is not the case .

		In the
Vyestnik Vremennavo Pravitelstva	PERSON	-LRB- the organ of the
Provisional Government	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- for
1917	DATE	, no. 89 , we read : For an actual and uniform realization of general in - struction all the elementary schools included in the school system , or all those which receive state grant for their upkeep or for the salaries of the personnel , among others , the church schools under the control of the
Greek Ortho	ORGANIZATION	- dox Church , as well as the Church Seminaries and two - class schools , are herewith transferred to the
Department of Public Instruction	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Lomonossoff	PERSON	further states that '' the main reform of the Russian schools consists of the crea - tion of a continuous school system which was in the process of creation already in
November	DATE	. ''

		In this Mr.
Lomonosan	PERSON	?

		contradicts himself .

		The
Bolshe	PERSON	- viki , as is wofl known , came to power only in No - vember .

		How , then , could a continuous school sys - tem have been in creation at so early a date , if it had not been worked out by some other than the Bolshevik authorities ?

		As a matter of fact , the re - organization of the entire school system was the product of the
Provisional Government	ORGANIZATION	and was de - creed as early as
June , 1917	DATE	-LRB- Vyestnik Vremennavo Pravitelstva
1917	DATE	, no. 85 -RRB- .

		The third and last point to which I would like to call Mr.
Lomonos	PERSON	- soff 's attention relates to his statement with regard to the Soviet orders which '' abolished directors and inspectors of public schools those Czarist agents of public ' unenlightenment ' who have through some misunderstanding survived the Provisional Govern - ment . ''

		I wish to remind the writer that a decree abolishing the Curator 's
Council	ORGANIZATION	, and with it its autocratic machinery , the directorates and inspecto - rates of school , was issued by the Provisional Gov - ernment on
September 26 , 1917	DATE	.

		-LRB-
Vyestnik Vre	ORGANIZATION	- mennavo Pravitelstva ,
1917	DATE	, no. 178 -RRB- .

		That the decree was not actually carried out is not the fault of the Provisional authorities .

		The
November	DATE	coup d'etat which brought about the Lenin-Trotzky regime simply precluded any further action and left to the succeeding authorities to carry out all or parts of the school program outlined by the various Minis - ters of the
Provisional Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		BRUTES IN UNIFORM SIR : A patient came into my office
this morning	TIME	whom I expected a week ago .

		When I asked him why he did n't come at the appointed time he said he could n't , he could n't show himself in the street .

		When I asked him why ^ * he said his face was all swollen .

		And when I asked him the cause of the swelling , he stated rather reluctantly , as if the sub - ject was too painful to dwell upon , that he had been beaten up , beaten up on

New York Call	LOCATION	.

		His wife , who was pregnatr , was also struck , and whether it was the blow or ; he shock of the whole horrible proceeding , she sour , had a hemorrhage and a miscarriage .

		It is false and hypocritical .

		For such lawless , u ; provoked brutality never could have taken place in
Prussia	LOCATION	or anywhere else in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		There was only one country where such unprovoked attacks on innocent and peaceful men , women , and children did take place ; that was
Russia	LOCATION	under the regime of the Czar .

		But even there the moujiks and the black hundreds had to be made drunk be - fore they would commit murderous excesses and brutalities .

		And some people who happened to be victims/of the Russian pogroms claim that our uni - formea rowdies excelled in cruelty and brutality even the Russian pogrom makers .

WM. J. ROBINSON	PERSON	,
M.D.	LOCATION	57 1 Notes on New Books THE YEARS BETWEEN .

		By
Rudyard Kipling	ORGANIZATION	.

		153 pages .

		Doubleday , Page . ''

		The remarkable Tightness of Rudyard Kipling , '' exclaims the jacket on this new volume of his verse .

		But in a score of these poems any unpre - judiced reader will be struck by his remarkable wrongness .

		He is unhesitatingly and consistently wrong about
Ireland	LOCATION	-LRB- in Ulster -RRB- , about revolution -LRB- in `` The City of Brass '' -RRB- , about the peace -LRB- in
Justice	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and even about Shakespeare -LRB- in The Craftsman -RRB- .

		Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	has learned nothing , nor has he changed anything ; his morality still rests on the Calvinistic dogma that '' he who lies will steal , who steals will slay , '' the medieval notion that the sword is a cleansing implement , and the Hebraic identification of justice and punishment .

		No doubt this simplicity in wrong-headedness , this predictabil - ity in error , on the part of reaction 's most vehement spokesman holds a certain encouragement for lib - erals : a mind so obviously wrong about women -LRB- The Female of the Species -RRB- will probably be dis - trusted when it considers labor -LRB- The Sons of
Martha	LOCATION	-RRB- ; and when it patently misinterprets the American spirit -LRB- The Choice -RRB- , it is likely to be held suspect about
Russia	LOCATION	-LRB-
Russia	LOCATION	to the Pacifists -RRB- .

		But what does it offer lovers of poetry , of whom no inconsiderable number have in the past been moved and refreshed by Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's muse ?

		Unhappily , very little .

		His mental rigidity now has its analogue in a poetical arteriosclerosis : the fixation of idea is gloved by a manner stereotyped even to its period - ical slovenliness .

		There was a time when a new Kipling volume was the earnest of another remark - able 1 ` envoi .

		Well , this book has had two titles -LRB- for it ` was to have been called GethseiHane -RRB- and thus contains two title pieces ; but what there is to choose between the
Uofgerel	PERSON	ballad Gejhsemane of which the last lines might be a grisly parody of
Edward Lear	PERSON	and the cryptic near-prose of the new piece , To the Seven Watchmen , is a metaphysi - cal question one is glad to leave to the publisher .

		Nothing else in the book is so incredibly bad as these , and the general monotony is broken by echoes of the old Kipling .

		Sometimes there is the mount - ing cadence , as in The Sons of Martha : It is their care in all the ages to take the buffet and cushion the shock .

		It is their care that the gear engages ; it is their care that the switches lock .

		It is their care that the wheels run truly , it is their care to embark and entrain , Tally , transport , ^ and deliver duly the
Sons of Mary	ORGANIZATION	by land and main .

		Oftener there is the lightning epithet :
France	LOCATION	`` furious in luxury , merciless in toil '' ; or '' brittle intellectuals who crack beneath a strain '' ; or '' He - learned to deal the far-off stone and poke the long , safe spear . ''

		But such echoes recur only about as often as one forgets that one is reading Kipling .

		Of his old breathless joy in the world the mul - tiple personality of the sea , the spell of the Orient , the harvest mood , the silence and sun of the downs , the fragrance of wood smoke at twilight there is here not a note .

		War 's the thing here , and war caught in conventional generalizations and abstrac - tions .

		Magic has given place to eloquence an elo - quence conventional and thin , or forced and shrill .

		Monosyllabic diction and a neat balance in phras - ing sometimes contrive to simulate stark vigor , but any favorite stanza from the early poems will be - tray the simulation as a verbal pose .

		There is econ - omy of utterance in The Years Between ; there is also a lamentable economy of emotion .

		Was Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	doing nothing but economize during the great war ?

		LANTERNS IN
GETHSEMANE	LOCATION	.

		By
Willard Wattles	PERSON	.

		152 pages .

		Button .

		If there is any fine secret in mysticism , it is hardly to be looked for in evangelical prefaces .


Willard Wattles	PERSON	' volume of mystical verse would gain immensely if he let it speak simply and suffi - ciently for itself .

		Not that it would speak with un - failing clarity and charm , but that it would to a - degree lose the Moody-and-Sankeyism of the prose that precedes it .

		The book is very uneven .

		It opens with a poem reminiscent , in its liquid syllables and erotic symbolism , of
Symons	PERSON	' translation of
St. John of the Cross	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is followed by one whose open - ing stanza promises rich entertainment : The little lonely souls go by Seeking their God who lives on high With conscious step and hat and all As if on Him they meant to call In some sad ceremonial .

		But the commonplace conclusion of this poem intimates the disappointments that are to follow .

		The sincerest convictions , even if they are touched with the romance that is never absent from religion , ^ do not of themselves make good poetry .

		Mr.
Wat	PERSON	- tles seems to be always sincere .

		His sense of the poetic is not so sure .

		Where he is simple and con - crete he gets an effect that is original and convinc - ing .

		But he is uncritical of his own work to such an extent that one could wish he had not gathered these poems into a volume until the mystic veil dropped at least from his critical faculty .

		A STUDY OF ENGLISH METRICS .

		By Ade -
la ^ de Crapsey	ORGANIZATION	.

		80 pages .

		Knopf .


Adelaide Crapsey	PERSON	, in her brief , intense , and so reserved life , in her tragic death at
Saranac Lake	ORGANIZATION	in
1914	DATE	, and in her singularly original and haunting verse , published posthumously , is one of those per - sonalities that are destined never to be very widely known , but who by a faithful few will always be admired reverenced even as one of the most authentic and appealing voices in modern poetry .

		57 THE DIAL
May 31	DATE	But this thought would never occur to those who made their first acquaintance with her through the present slim gray volume .

		A Study , of English Metrics further work on which was interrupted by the author 's death can only by the most vivid imagination be conceived as the work of a woman who possessed in herself a creative gift of a very high order .

		In purpose , in scope , and in treatment
Miss Crapsey	LOCATION	's book - which we have only as one completed fragment is most distinctly analytic , sci - entific I had almost said pedantic .

		Her material is , in Shakespearean phrase , '' words , words , words . ''

		The relationship of poetry and metrics , not to scansion or rhythm proper but to '' phonetic word - structure '' this is her thesis and she develops it here with a patience and thoroughness that must seem to many appalling .

		The fundamental question is that of poetic vocabularies : Miss Crapsey selects certain poets
Milton	LOCATION	,
Pope	LOCATION	,
Tennyson	LOCATION	, Swin - burne ,
Francis Thompson	PERSON	, and
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	for special study .

		She dissects numerous poems by these men , dwells on the various peculiarities of phonetic usage and syllabification and by means of elaborate tables arranges the work of each man as analyzed by herself in a series of columns which show the percentages of words of different phonetic value .

		Nevertheless , through all these abstruse pages one perceives the operation of a sound instinct , an instinct which , like that of
Edgar Poe	PERSON	or Ste - phane Mallarme , realizes the close connection there is and always must be between the utterances of genuine poetry and the technical machinery of words , syllables , feet , meter , and rhythm .

		One would have liked to see Miss Crapsey laboring on the phonetics of men like
John Gould Fletcher	PERSON	,
Carl Sandburg	PERSON	,
Conrad Aiken	PERSON	,
Robert Frost	PERSON	,
Max	PERSON	- well Bodenheim ; but in defense of our author one should remember that the poets she selected offered the best opportunities for constructing a solid foundation for a theory which , had it been com - pleted , would probably have been more than equal to the task of analyzing modern poetic tendencies .

		And in any case , no one who believes poetry to be a serious and important part of the individual life can question the very real value of the motives that prompted Miss Crapsey to make these studies , so unfortunately interrupted .

		And those who persist in regarding the author as a pedant or a mere thesis - maker will find in her own verse particularly in the exquisite Cinquain the one quality that forgives even the dryest discourse , and justifies it genius .

		POEMS .

		By
Gerard Manley Hopkins	PERSON	.

		Edited with notes by
Robert Bridges	ORGANIZATION	.

		124 pages .


Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		The chief interest in these posthumous poems lies in their metrical eccentricities .

		The author 's preface has much to say concerning various types of rhythm '' running , '' '' sprung , '' '' logaoedic , '' of counterpoint , of '' hangers on , '' of '' outrides , '' of lines '' rove over , '' and so forth .

		He utilizes in much of his verse the sprung rhythm , which was em - ployed in Greek and Latin lyric poetry , and in Piers Ploughman , but which he says has not been used in English since Elizabethan times ,
Green	ORGANIZATION	being the last to recognize it .

		The subject matter of Father
Hopkins	PERSON	' poetry is too prevailingly theological to gain a wide reading .

		On becoming a Jesuit , he burnt his early verse as unsuited to priestly ideals , but later he began writing again .

		His style possesses a teasing quaintness , an antique tone oddly incongruous with the time of publication .

		The poems frequently are cbscure , ex - cessively so , as if the writer deliberately strove to mystify his readers .

		The lack of intelligibility usually results from unwise condensation , or from the omission of relative pronouns , as in the line : Squander the hell-rook ranks sally to molest him .

		These poems , seen in manuscript by only two or three persons during the author 's lifetime , and pub - lished thirty years after his death , show a kinship with the roughness and obscurity , as well as with the force , of
Browning	PERSON	and
Meredith	PERSON	.

		They ex - press a strange talent , but will claim few readers .

		POEMS .

		By
Geoffrey Dearmer	PERSON	.

		McBride .

		pages .

		A perusal of this small volume will probably in - cline the reader to the opinion that
Geoffrey Dearmer	PERSON	is somewhat over recognized .

		One finds him personable and graceful , but rather the journey - man and junior in craft and habit .

		And although he exhibits considerable easiness in the ceremonial of poetry , he is a little infrequent in his command of its rare and precise magic .

		Such lines as : Now at setting day Moored water-lilies , pale as argent sky , Cling to the twilight , fading silently .

		are of promise ; the promise however is nearly for - gotten when we read '' Hate is strong but love is stronger . ''

		Moreover , though such clear-struck images are not exactly few in these poems , never - theless with
Geoffrey Dearmer	PERSON	poetry seems to be a matter of parts .

		There is hardly a poem here which possesses central conformity , or the totality and interior fusion which are a part of the chief requisites to poetic importance .

		Keats * Before Ac - tion has many lines of distinction , but it struggles with a feeble end ; The French Mother to
Her Unborn Child	ORGANIZATION	has a finished dignity , yet is not quite final ; The Strolling Singer is furnished with a certain graceful currency : A little sylvan man with beckoning eyes And limbs of lithe expression .

		It appears to be currency however , not coinage ; and as such it can be said to do not very much more .

		1919 THE DIAL 573 than keep solvency and peace with the reader .

		The Poems show , rather fitfully , a sensitive though not very energetic perception , a sense of scene and , a very considerable feeling for appearances and as - pects .

		But the author 's imaginative intercourse with the world is neither particularly rich nor particu - larly various .

		His scope of sensibility so far seems not very extensive , and his penetration not intense .

		His distinguished parts are lines rather than poems , and are relatively few to carry a good deal that is unmemorable .

		He should probably be regarded rather conservatively until he has pros - ecuted some poetic journey home .

		POEMS .

Michael Strange	PERSON	.

		172 pages .

		Brentano .

		Unlike many who attempt vers libre
Michael Strange	ORGANIZATION	has command of rhythm and skill at design .

		These desirable prerequisites are not sustained how - ever by a real creative power .

		Instead we get dec - orative effects , thin tapestries of emotions not over - strong , a sense of straining for depth , echoes from an incongruous mixture of Whitman , French decadents , and English esthetes of the nineties .

		Still the decoration , although tending to the rococo and the impossibly bizarre , is suggestive at least of beauty ; and a few poems , notably in the section called Moods , deserve preservation as worthy ex - pressions of the reactions of a sensitive aloof youth to an especially excited world .

		THE DRUMS IN OUR STREET .

		By
Mary Carolyn Davies	PERSON	.

		131 pages .


Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	.

		.

		Mary
Carolyn Davies	PERSON	seemed , a few years ago , a name to conjure with .

		She was doing many slight poignant poems that promised even more than they gave .

		Nearly all showed a sense of that dark un - conscious out of which life springs like a roused tiger .

		Nearly all were marked by a strong nervous pulse , by a vivid metaphor , an evocative adjective .

		Whether the popularity these gifts rightly brought her itself led the way to their easy destruction is not sure .

		Possibly she has a volume of unpublished poems which belie the things she sees fit to print .

		At all events The Drums in Our Street are cal - culated to rouse the emotions of the naive sentiment - alist , to thrill the blood of the populace , and to chill the hopes of the critic .

		The very traces of Miss
Davies	PERSON	' early skill waken a graver disappointment .

		She never seemed like a drummer before , and this book makes her look too much like the merchant 's conception of one .

		The theme that seems most to engage her in these poems is the way in which war threw men and women suddenly into that intense relation which peace takes longer to mature .

		The boy and girl who become engaged before he goes off , the man and woman who marry in tragic romantic haste , before the love life is permanently stopped , these small innumerable dramas intrigue her beyond all others .

		War has distorted and dis - rupted the sexual life as profoundly as it has af - fected any other , and it may well be that after the war the whole edifice of our morality -LRB- in its etymo - logical sense -RRB- will be reconstructed .

		Miss
Davies	PERSON	however is content to continue romanticizing , as careless here as elsewhere of the deeper issues in - volved .

		That these can be adequately treated in poetry , witness among the greater poets ,
Robinson	PERSON	, among the younger men ,
T. S. Eliot	PERSON	.

		Withal , there are moments when the author catches her old singing voice .

		Smith , of the
Third Oregon	ORGANIZATION	, Dies is typical at once of her most flagrant faults and her familiar sensitiveness . ''

		Autumn in
Oregon	LOCATION	... and pheasants flying Gold , green and red , Great , narrow , lovely things , As -LRB- if an orchid had snatched wings .

		But such passages are few and far between .

		And the approach to prose that her simple diction always made is hastened by a facile sentimentalism .

		JOYCE KILMER : POEMS , - ESSAYS , AND LET - TERS .

		Edited with a memoir by
Robert Cortes Holliday	PERSON	.

		2 vols .

		; 559 pages .

		Doran .

		In this memorial edition the best of
Joyce Kilmer	PERSON	's writing in both prose and verse has been brought together within four covers .

		All his best-known later poems are here , including five which he sent from
France	LOCATION	; and there is , besides , an ample selec - tion from his first book of verse , A
Summer	DATE	of Love , which has long been out of print .

		Two or three essays , a story , and a playlet , all abounding in
Kilmer	PERSON	's joyous humor , are given in the prose volume .

		The most interesting and valuable of the prose however is in the numerous letters , for in them the personal charm of the young poet-journalist is more intimately revealed than in his studied writ - ings .

		They help those who did not know him to un - derstand how he won the admiration and affection of the hundreds who did .

		Kilmer 's work as a re - viewer , which must have been voluminous and was certainly interesting , is not represented in these volumes .

		With this possible exception , there is prob - ably everything here that he would have wished to preserve , and probably there is little here that he would have wished away .

		The memoir by
Kilmer	PERSON	's friend and literary executor is written with the verve and enthusiasm of
Kilmer	PERSON	's own best manner .

		Nowhere do these sparkling pages betray any disposition to senti - mentalize their hero or to represent him as anything but what he actually was a large-bfained , large - hearted American , gloriously young and strong and energetic , with an extraordinary talent for the written and spoken word and a positive genius for making people love him .

		Page by page the portrait grows until , at the end , one feels that he has known this man .

		If Mr.
Holliday	PERSON	's estimates seem at times a bit too admiring , it is to be remembered that they are usually concerned not with
Kilmer	PERSON	the writer , 574 THE DIAL
May 31	DATE	about whose merits anyone may judge , but with
Kilmer	PERSON	the man , who , by abundant testimony , captured the imaginations of all who knew him .

		If the riant and virile spirit of
Joyce Kilmer	PERSON	were not so antagonistic to all pathos , there would be in this definitive edition of his writing a certain pathetic interest .

		For this is all we shall ever have from the man who was killed in action on
July 30 , 1918	DATE	, being then in his thirty - third year .

		But , as it is , one feels that his death , like his life and all his work , must have been jubilant .

		He was a happy warrior , both at home and at the front , and he would have made as excellent a poet laureate to the
American Army	ORGANIZATION	as
Theodore Botrel	PERSON	has been to the French .

		His life was an incessant boyhood , although he packed into the
last decade	DATE	of it a full lifetime 's activity and accomplishment .

		Life was still opening before him and was never more dear to him than when he cheerfully laid it down .

		And so one may say that , although it was tragic , his death was not sad .

		Mrs.
Kilmer	PERSON	need fear no comparison with her husband .

		Using the simplest ways of expression , she yet avoids the commonplace by her grace , her whimsicality , her quiet sincerity , her sensitiveness to beauty .

		Small ,
Maynard	ORGANIZATION	;
Boston	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	's Anthology has become so in - stitutional , in a sense , as hardly to call for review .

		One knows now , in advance , what to expect of it .

		It is always copious and over-inclusive , contains always a great deal of mediocre but creditable verse and here and there a poem which it might be pleasant to be able to reread ten years from now .

		One suspects that the motive of the venture is as much commercial as literary .

		Otherwise one finds it hard to explain the presence here of , say at least one half of the material .

		Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	's list of books published during the year is useful .

		His list of critical articles would be better if it were more complete : it has a little the appearance of favoritizing the editor .

		The critical summaries of the year 's '' best books of verse '' are what one ex - pects from Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	fulsome , uncritical , and guided , in several instances , one is sure , by motives more personal than esthetic .

		How other - wise is one to explain the eulogy of The Lover 's Rosary , by
Brookes	PERSON	More ?

		One regrets that Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	is not a little more conscientious .

		How TO READ POETRY .

		By
Ethel M. Colson	PERSON	.

		179 pages .

		McClurg ;
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		Since the laws that Pope laid down in his Essay on Criticism were definitely and successfully broken by the Romanticists , the science of poetry has .

		been hazy and fragmentary .

		Most people , in fact , have refused even to think of it as a science , and have viewed poets with much the same awe that they would show whales , and have considered them as fortuitous as ambergris .

		Lately however , a more exact curiosity has grown up .

		Mr.
Patterson	PERSON	and
Miss Lowell	LOCATION	with their phonographic experiments , and a certain
M. Verrier	PERSON	with a metronome , have been doing im - portant foundation work in what is perhaps the oldest of the arts .

		In The Writing and
Reading of Verse Lieutenant Andrews	ORGANIZATION	tries always to keep these researches in view .

		One notes with interest that this somewhat elementary essay into poetical exactitudes tends rather to break up the old , fast theories than to confirm them .

		Especially is this fact apparent in the chapter on free verse , and in the stimulating treatment of the meters -LRB- one may safely use the word in the plural -RRB- of blank verse .

		Yet as a work of science the volume is not an entire suc - cess .

		It is confused in its attitudes , propounds vague theories , and lays much more stress on the a prior - isms of Lanier than on the sound thinking of
Tro	ORGANIZATION	- fessor
Gummere	PERSON	.

		Only when considered as a com - pendium of hitherto uncompiled facts , as a textbook in a course on writing poetry that still remains to be given , does the book gain undisputed value .

		Lieu - tenant
Andrews	PERSON	has furnished that much-needed article , a new saddle for
Pegasus	ORGANIZATION	.

		Miss
Colson	PERSON	's book is of a quite different category .

		An indiscriminate enthusiast , she belpngs , no doubt , to
Hermione 's Little Group of Serious Thinkers	ORGANIZATION	.

		Her motive in writing is to convert the quarter - educated into the half-educated indeed a praise - worthy aim .

		As for her conclusions , she gives them best in her own words : Everybody should read poetry .

		Why ?

		Because everybody loves it .

		-LRB- For particulars see Chapter I -RRB- Again why ?

		Because everybody loves , needs , desires , seeks enjoy - ment , and the reading of poetry , properly performed and pursued , makes for universal enjoyment of a high , rich , rare , inexpensive , highly diversified , never-ending and ever-vernal order .

		-LRB- For further particulars see Chapter II -RRB- How then to extract this enjoyment from poetry , to cause poetry to yield its rare treasure in plain and pain - less manner , in a word , `` How to Read Poetry ? ''

		Why , good sir or madam , perfectly simple and easy .

		Read poetry just as you would bathe or dress or write a letter or eat your dinner or play golf or take a car down town .

		576 THE DIAL
May 31	DATE	Books of the Fortnight War and Love , by
Richard Aldington	PERSON	-LRB- 94 pages ;
Four Seas Co.	ORGANIZATION	;
Boston	LOCATION	-RRB- , succeeds the author 's Images Old and New , and contains poems written between
1915	DATE	and
1918	DATE	.

		In a foreword to
F. S. Flint	ORGANIZATION	Mr.
Alding	PERSON	- ton says : `` Here I have written less for myself and you and others who are interested in subtleties and more for the kind of men I lived with in camp and in the line ... Perhaps I have lost some - thing by this . ''

		... Whatever he has lost of the cold fire and chiseled form of the Images is richly returned in a warmer passion , a new humanity .

		Al - ways the honest artist , he is now the honest reporter of war and of love in wartime , though it drives him to meter and rhyme and an intensification of sex that recalls
Donne	PERSON	.

		There is ecstasy and exquisite suffering in these poems , but not sentimentality .

		The war has produced no more genuine poetry .

		The Beloved Stranger : Two Books of Song and a Diver - tisement for the Unknown Lover , by
Witter Bynner	PERSON	-LRB- 100 pages ; Knopf -RRB- , is probably as
William Marion Reedy	PERSON	maintains in his preface a collabora - tion between
Witter Bynner	PERSON	and ''
Emanuel Morgan	PERSON	, '' his alias in the notorious Spectrist hoax -LRB- see THE DIAL of
April 25 , 1918	DATE	, page 410 -RRB- .

		One wonders whether even Mr.
Bynner	PERSON	can draw an exact line between what is his and what is his alter ego 's in these brittle , economical , often merely clever , some - times very moving poems .

		Bynner must be allowed their Oriental flavor the Chinese simplicity and the Japanese suspense their neat -LRB- occasionally too neat -RRB- balance in phrasing , and their passion when they have passion , which such pieces as Lightning and
Laurel	ORGANIZATION	have richly .

		Are the others those that are bizarre instead of exotic , clever instead of intense really
Morgan	ORGANIZATION	's ?

		Having put forth Bynner as Mor - gan in Spectra : New Poems -LRB- Kennerley -RRB- , is the team now attempting to put forth
Morgan	PERSON	as Bynner that is , inverting the hoax to catch us on the re - bound ?

		The Passing God , by
Harry Kemp	PERSON	-LRB- 156 pages ;
Bren	PERSON	- tano -RRB- , has by way of sub-title Songs for Lovers .

		And some of them as , for instance , Hermitage do sing .

		Others , like Resurrection , have fetching conceits .

		Most of them , however , are magazine verse of about the right blend of sentimentality and cynicism , and deal pretty conventionally with familiar passions , hopes , fears and inconstancies .

		Many , indeed , are devoted to ladies of the olden time , among which one is a long but seldom distinguished narrative poem about Cresseid , '' inspired by the medieval Scotch of
Robert Henryson	PERSON	'' and , rather wanly , by
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volume cdntains A Commendatory Ad - dress to the Gentle Reader by
Richard LeGallienne	PERSON	.

		The Pursuit of Happiness , and Other Poems , by
Benja	LOCATION	- min R. C. Low -LRB- 136 pages ; Lane -RRB- , is the fourth vol - ume of verse by the author of The Sailor Who Has Sailed .

		The title poem is a sequence of fifty-five sonnets .

		Mr.
Low	PERSON	's muse ts rather short of breath and is too much given to abstractions , to literary diction and to combinations of monosyllables and pauses that are more rough than vigorous .

		The reader is rewarded , however , by a dashing vigor of epithet and verb , a not infrequent originality , and an occasional lyric flight .


Browning	PERSON	has influenced this poet both for good and ill .

Arthur Waley	PERSON	-LRB- 243 pages ; Knopf -RRB- , convey in unpre - tentious , artless free verse the simplicity and direct - ness that make the substance of Chinese poetry charm - ing .

		The manner of their translation scarcely sug - gests the studied literary artifice that governs its form .

		A valuable expository essay and a critical bibliography precede the poems .

		Baudelaire 's Poems and Prose Poems , translated by
F. P. Sturm	PERSON	-LRB- 192 pages ; Brentano -RRB- , devotes more than fifty pages to a characteristic gossip by
James Hune	PERSON	- ker on the life , labors , and legend of the '' extraor - dinary poet with a bad conscience ... Exist - ence for such natures is a sort of muffled delirium . ''

		Mr.

Dicenta	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The translation is obviously conscientious but rather stiff and uncolloquial .

		The introduction serves to place the dramas in their frame of contemporary Spanish literature , and the volume is a valuable comment on the present-day life of
Spain	LOCATION	.

		Everybody 's Husband , by
Gilbert Cannan	PERSON	-LRB- 36 pages ;
Huebsch	PERSON	-RRB- , is a short one - act fantasy in which a young bride discourses with her maternal ancestors about the problem of the eternal masculine .

		It is no mark of literary strength that it recalls
Maeterlinck	PERSON	's The Betrothal badly diluted .

		The Undying Fire : A Contemporary Novel , by
H. G. Wells	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- 229 pages ;
Macmillan	PERSON	-RRB- , is less a novel than an eloquent conversation which becomes a sermon and gets interrupted by an operation .

		It combines Mr.

		Our
House	ORGANIZATION	, by
Henry Seidel Canby	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- 308 pages ;
Macmil	ORGANIZATION	- lan -RRB- , is just the sort of novel a groping college pro- fessor would write .

		It is not only that his heroines remind him of the ladies that
Botticelli	PERSON	and
Leonardo	PERSON	used to paint , or that
Walter Pater	PERSON	is a conversational stalking-horse .

		The problem before die young hero is conceived from the academic point of view , and the material in which he works out its solution -LRB- especially
Bohemia	LOCATION	-RRB- is the product of an academic imagination .

		The author - enters a technical defense of his tepid story by dating it from the Spanish War .

		Aristokia , by

		The proletariat suffer the nonsense of moneyed and titled aristocracy to come to full flower in a small hothouse territory called Aristokia .

		If the execution of the story is not as successful as the conception is promising , it is because the author takes too lightly the obligation to answer the questions the situation raises , and too seriously the obligation to be always humorous .

		Claire , by
Leslie Burton Blades	PERSON	-LRB- 269 pages ;
Doran	PERSON	-RRB- , has unique interest for a story of adventure , since the conflict about which the story centers is that between divergent philosophies of life .

		The characters are a blind artist , a woman of fashion , and a Spanish recluse .

		This first novel promises a writer of intel - lectual distinction .

		The Clintons and Others , by

Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , compacts in two volumes the epic story of that coun - try - 's suffering during four and a half years of mal - treatment and misrule .

		It is a fitting monument to mark the buried past .

		Fighting the Flying Circus , by Captain
Edward V. Rick	PERSON	- enbacher -LRB- 371 pages ;
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , chronicles the deeds done with the fine courage that youth puts at the service of any cause .

		If there is no more of the war in this story than there is of the world in a college freshman 's letters home , no fault is to be found with the author on this account .

		Perhaps it is too much to ask one man to fight a war and understand it too .

Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , recalls the days when the

		Sixteen chapters on preparations in
America	LOCATION	and abroad are inadequately illuminated by one chapter on performance at the front .

		Mr.

Dut	PERSON	- ton -RRB- , is a study in conflicting nationalities , now ap - pearing in a seventh and revised edition .

		The author treats specifically the problem of the French in Can - ada , but his fair and candid analysis is not without its applications to
Ireland	LOCATION	, to
Poland	LOCATION	, and even to the
United States	LOCATION	.

		His stand for recognizing large na - tional groups rather than attempting to assimilate them might well be pondered by the '' treat - 'em - rough '' school of Americanizers .

		If the belligerent

Dodd	PERSON	,

Boni	PERSON	and
Liveright	PERSON	-RRB- , gives in detail the attitude of various British labor groups toward the problems raised by the war and recon - struction .

		It is a guidebook to the new social order .

		Over 100 pages of appendices make the volume in - valuable for documentary reference .

		The Six Hour Day , by Lord Leverhulme -LRB- 344 pages ;
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- , advocates a drastic reduction in hours on the ground that a 72 hour week arranged in two shifts of 36 hours each would effect a great economy in production .

		In other essays and addresses included in the book the founder of Port Sunlight discusses the industrial questions of the day .

		Management and Men , by
Meyer Bloomfield	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- 591 pages ; Century -RRB- , is mainly a compendium of the changes in the organization of industry as developed in the

		The Shop System as it has developed in this country is a scheme for keep - ing the peace and handling labor disputes before they become widespread or complex .

		Crime and Criminals , by
Charles Mercier	PERSON	-LRB- 290 pages ;
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- , discusses the jurisprudence of crime from the medical , biological , and psychological points of view .

		The author is in reaction against those who attribute crime to the sole influence of either environment or heredity , and he seeks to give due weight to impov - erished surroundings , defective physical equipment , and malicious adventure .

		His position is usually sound , but his treatment , in spite of his wide official practice , does not trust sufficiently in the authority of case and example .

Hough	PERSON	- ton
Mifflin	LOCATION	;
Boston	LOCATION	-RRB- , is an attempt to provide the social worker with a technique for medical diagnosis and social treatment .

		5 82 THE DIAL
May 31	DATE	Current News Those who sit by their cozy firesides assembling out-of-door anthologies are sometimes as amusing as the sad , watery-eyed gentlemen that the swinging doors disclose , glass in hand , indulging in the indoor sport of '' watching the ball game '' on the news - ticker .

		And yet to the producing of anthologies there seems to be no limit short of the range of subjects in which anthologists can interest themselves .


Robert Frothingham	PERSON	admits in his introduction to his Songs of Men -LRB-
Hough	PERSON	ton Mifflin -RRB- that `` with such an idea as the title indicates , it was inevitable that the old favorites be overlooked and that ' many a gem of purest ray serene ' should be rescued from obscurity . ''

		But a careful perusal of this collection warns one anew that inevitability is rarer than accident .

		This personal scrap-book will make more appeal to indoor people whose imaginations revel in a fighting outdoor life than to lovers of poetry .

		Seek the quieter atmosphere of
Maude Cuney Hare	PERSON	's Message of the Trees -LRB-
Corrihill	ORGANIZATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		This volume is made up chiefly of poetry with an occasional passage in prose and dates from
Deuter	LOCATION	- onomy and the old Chinese to our younger group of poets .

		The lover of poetry or of nature can stroll through Mrs.
Hare	PERSON	's park of some two hun - dred trees , assured either of the message or of poetry pefhaps of both .


Williams Haynes	PERSON	and
Joseph LeRoy Harrison	PERSON	advertise that in Fisherman 's Verse -LRB-
Duffield	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- they have brought up such a catch as ''
Izaak Walton	PERSON	,
James Whitcomb Riley	PERSON	,
Andrew Lang	PERSON	, and
Robert Bridges	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Looking closer one finds the catch in - cluding no more unimportant specimens than Vaniere ,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	,
Scott	PERSON	,
Pope	LOCATION	,
Dobson	PERSON	,
Donne	PERSON	, and
Wordsworth	PERSON	, although in a mood better adapted to fishing than to poetry .

		Turning now to the open sea , we find many of these familiar figures better represented .

		A Book of the Sea -LRB-
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- contains representative sea poems from the
Bible	LOCATION	, from the Greek ,
Latin	LOCATION	, Italian and French languages , and even , with an unobtrusive generosity , six from
America	LOCATION	, four of which are
Whitman 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		This pro- vokes a question as to why the States , which with their sea and coastal beauty have produced a large number of marine canvasses , have at the same time produced so few good sea poems .

		Where is our tradition of the sea ?

		This book indicates that it is still in
England	LOCATION	.

		In Victory !

		Celebrated by Thirty-Eight Amer - ican Poets , brought together by
William Stanley Braithwaite	PERSON	-LRB- Small
Maynard	PERSON	-RRB- , we are permitted a glimpse of the esoteric celebration in which thirty - eight poets indulged , presumably during the time that many of their less expressive countrymen thronged the streets .

		Is it perhaps because we wit - ness this celebration after the fact , that we imagine we found more spontaneity and genuine emotion in the streets on
November 6	DATE	last than we find in most of these poems ?

		Or are we once more victimized by Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	's capricious judgment ?

		The Poetry of Peace , selected by
Irene Leonard	PERSON	-LRB-
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is a collection of poems in which many of the authors indicate that the lenses of their vision are bifocal , for they give us meditative poems of war and peace in their various relations .

		There is genuine poetry here , written with rare exceptions by well-known English and American poets .

		There is no reference to the war just ended , and no poets of the younger school are included , although a few of those represented are still living .

		This collection leaves one the per - , suasion that the best war poetry is produced after and not during war .

		A belief that is not disturbed by
Verse for Patriots	ORGANIZATION	, edited by
Jean Broadhurst	PERSON	and
Clara L. Rhodes	PERSON	-LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , a selection of war songs and poems produced during the last five years .

		Corn from Olde Fieldes , edited by
Eleanor M. Brougham	PERSON	-LRB- Lane -RRB- , purports to be `` an anthology of English poems of lesser known writers of the earlier periods . ''

		While the reader will feel at home among these poets , and will recognize a large part of the later poems , many of the selections are little known and some of the anonymous pieces will be discoveries .

		It is to be hoped that , at its popular price , this book will justify its existence by bring - ing the rich beauty of the earliest English poetry to a wider public .

		Fifty thousand American men are buried 1 on the battlefields of
France	LOCATION	where they fell in fulfillment of the pledge given by the American peo - ple that a war against German autocracy should end .

		in a democratic peace .

		THE DIAL remembers the high resolve with which those men went forth .

		Will
America	LOCATION	forget ?

		The fight is won .

		Shall victory mock - the dead ?

		The peace terms written by the Allied governments are not the terms for which
America	LOCATION	entered the war .

		They are terms inspired by the mili - tary imperialism against which we fought .

		They are an affront and a betrayal .

		What is
America	LOCATION	going to do about it ?

		Forget and grow fat with impe - rialistic prosperity ?

		Or keep the faith ?

		THE DIAL will not be an accomplice in this chicanery .

		M ^ ^ J'iiiNlt , ^ ^ THE DIAL A FORTNIGHTLY Back to Principles AHE OFFICIAL COMMENTARY on the Covenant says that '' if the Nations of the future are in the main selfish , grasping , and bellicose , no instrument or machinery will restrain them . ''

		Exactly the same thing might have been said and no doubt was said by our remote forefathers about individuals .

		Yet we have succeeded in restraining I do not say eradicating the selfishness , the cupidity , and the bellicosity of individuals by preventing them from .

		being a law unto themselves .

		There is nothing intrinsically impossible in restraining nations by the same means ; the difficulty is that too many of those that profess to will the end do not will the means .

		It is assumed that a nation must always be a law unto itself , just as no doubt it was once assumed that the individual must be .

		The obstacle to any genuine international organization is the conception of the sovereign independent state and , if we really wish to try to get rid of war , we must first of all abolish the sovereign independent state .

		Some means must te devised for depriving the state of authority out - side its own borders while leaving it autonomy with - in them .

		The present Covenant makes no attempt to do that ; the whole structure of the
League	ORGANIZATION	is built up on the good faith of governments an insecure foundation .

		The measure of the disappointment which the Constitution of the
League	ORGANIZATION	has caused among those that were the first to welcome President
Wilson	PERSON	's idea may be gaged by the declaration on the sub - ject of the
French Socialist Party	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the manifesto adopted at the
National Congress of the Party	ORGANIZATION
last week	DATE	the opinion was expressed that the new organ - ization will be nothing but '' a league of Capitalists having at their service an international
White Army	ORGANIZATION	for the purpose of fighting the social revolution everywhere . ''

		The manifesto in which this passage occurs was adopted without a vote being given against it except by the extreme left of the
Party	ORGANIZATION	, which proposed an alternative text even less com - plimentary to the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	; the former '' Majoritaires '' abstained from voting , but on the ground that the manifesto condemned the policy followed by the party during the war .

		The decla - ration about the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	therefore prob - ably expressed the unanimous opinion of French Socialists and I should say the nearly unanimous opinion of the Socialists of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		How can it be otherwise when they see the five great powers which will dominate the League backing all the enemies of the Russian Revolution and inciting Roumania to overthrow the revolution in
Hungary	LOCATION	?

		Bitter indeed has been the disappointment of the Social - ists and Labor parties of
Europe	LOCATION	at Mr.
Wil	PERSON	- son 's acquiescence in such proceedings as these .

		The Roumanian attack on
Hungary	LOCATION	, incited or rather ordered by the Allies , is not only an unwarrantable interference in the internal affairs of another coun - try but also a breach of the
Armistice	ORGANIZATION	.

		What con - fidence can be placed in a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	inaugurated by such measures as these ?

		Moreover , a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	on whose council five powers have five representatives and all the others only four has an unpleasant resemblance to a
Holy Alliance	ORGANIZATION	.

		Another cause of profound disappointment is the utter inadequacy of the provisions in the Covenant relating to disarmament .

		The peoples of
Europe	LOCATION	have been told that this was '' a war to end war '' ; their great hope was that it would at least end compulsory military service and huge conscriptronist armies ; they now see that there is not the remotest probability of its doing anything of the sort .

		Perhaps their feelings on the subject are fairly well repre - sented by the following passage in the manifesto of the French Socialist Party already mentioned : The party denounces the hypocrisy of the French rulers who , after having exploited the ignorance and credulity of the masses of the people by making them believe that the war was merely one for national defence , for the free self-determination of peoples , for the destruction of militarism and the suppression of armaments , are now devoting themselves to giving this war a purely imperial - ist and capitalist solution whence will inevitably issue fresh conflicts unless the international proletariat soon becomes master of its destinies .

		Since nothing is to be gained by blinking the truth , I am obliged to say that it is not only the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	that has caused disappointment .

		When Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	first came over to
Europe	LOCATION	, he was enthusiastically welcomed by all the liberal elements and by the masses of the people in every country .

		On him were fixed the eyes of all that 5 88 THE DIAL
June 14	DATE	sincerely desired to remove the causes of war and establish international comity .

		I should be depart - ing from the truth if I said that Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's position was still the same .

		He has not placated his enemies they have never been so violent and he has not retained the confidence of his friends .

		When I last wrote it was believed that Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	would leave the
Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	rather than yield to the demands of the
French Government	ORGANIZATION	in regard to the
Saar Valley	LOCATION	and the
Left Bank of the Rhine	ORGANIZATION	.

		He has agreed to a compromise in regard to the
Saar Valley	ORGANIZATION	which must inevitably make it a cause of new dissensions .

		The annexation of the territory by
France	LOCATION	would be at once more honest and less dangerous to the peace of
Europe	LOCATION	than this hybrid solution .

		And how can Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	reconcile with democratic principles the handing over of the inhab - itants of the
Saar Valley	ORGANIZATION	to the control of a direct - orate of five persons , of whom only one will be chosen by the inhabitants themselves ?

		A few days ago I should have been obliged to say that no man in history had had a greater opportunity than that which Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	had lost .

		He has indeed made a stand in regard to the Italian claims , but are the Italian claims in fact any worse or any less consist - ent with the
Fourteen Points	ORGANIZATION	than the claims of other Allies , of
France	LOCATION	or
Japan	LOCATION	, for instance ?

		Great
Britain	LOCATION	is no more blameless than the others .

		It is British ambitions in
Egypt	LOCATION	and
Mesopotamia	LOCATION	and
Persia	LOCATION	that have weakened Mr.
Lloyd George	PERSON	's hands in the conflict with French and Italian im - perialism .

		We have imposed our rule on
Egypt	LOCATION	in defiance of the wishes of the inhabitants and , when they rose against us in defense of their liberties , we suppressed the rising with a severity which , if the accounts be true , should make us hold our tongues in future about German atrocities .

		I do not know how far the accounts are true , for the
Government	ORGANIZATION	as usual has deprived us of any but the most meager information .

		L'Humanite published on
April 26	DATE	a pathetic and very moderate account by
Zagloul Pasha	PERSON	of the wrongs of his country ;
M. Francois Crucy	PERSON	, who interviewed the
Pasha	PERSON	on behalf of the paper , said that
England	LOCATION	was dishonored by what had happened .

		I agree with him .

		And I fully understand the feeling of Frenchmen and Italians that , so long as our government acts in this way , it is not in a position to oppose the imperialism of their governments .

		It was perhaps because Mr.
Lloyd George	PERSON	felt that too that .

		he deserted Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	in the matter of the
Saar Valley	ORGANIZATION	and supported the French demands which he had hitherto opposed .

		That able American supporter of European im - perialism , Mr.
Frank H. Simonds	PERSON	, has said that Mr.
George	PERSON	bowed '' to the will of British Parlia - ment and British public opinion . ''

		Mr.
Simonds	PERSON	is mistaken about British public opinion .

		The British Parliament , although it is only four months old , no longer represents public opinion .

		The by-elec - tion at
Central Hull	ORGANIZATION	has shown that the ministerial coalition can not even hold a seat which it won in
December	DATE	by a majority of 10,000 .

		The issues be - fore the electors of Central Hull were conscription and the imperialist ambitions of the Allies ; they realized , as the public in general now realizes , that the former is the logical result of the latter .

		Central Aberdeen has now given the same verdict .

		That Mr.
Lloyd George	PERSON	was subjected to pressure in this coun - try is true ; perhaps the bitterness of his attack on Lord Northcliffe in the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	the other day wtis an indication of annoyance at having yielded to that pressure .

		Everything that Mr.
Lloyd George	PERSON	said about Lord Northcliffe was true , but it was just as true when Lord Northcliffe put Mr.
Lloyd George	PERSON	into power and the latter is rather late in finding it out .

		Moreover the attack would have carried more weight if Mr.
George	PERSON	had not once more followed
Lord Northcliffe	ORGANIZATION	's policy .

		Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's compromise in regard to the
Saar Valley	LOCATION	has also weakened his protest against the Italian claims .


Italy	LOCATION	has in fact a much better claim to
Fiume	ORGANIZATION	than has
France	LOCATION	to the
Saar Valley	LOCATION	, for there is a large Italian population in Fiume Italians claim that it is even the majority whereas there is no French population in the
Saar Valley	LOCATION	.

		In protesting against the Dalmatian annexations guar - anteed to ,
Italy	LOCATION	by the iniquitous treaty made when she entered the war Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	is on stronger ground .

		But how much stronger would have been his position if he had taken a firm stand long ago against all such claims from whatever quarter they came !

		It was in his power to make conditions when
America	LOCATION	came into the war and he has had many opportunities of making them since .

		The facts that he never signed the Pact of
London	LOCATION	and that
Europe	LOCATION	is to so great an extent dependent on
America	LOCATION	economically and financially give him an unique position at the
Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	.

		The opponents of imperialism in
France	LOCATION	itself regret that Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	should have waited until now to make his stand .

		M.
Marcel Sembat	PERSON	, who was a member of the
Viviani	PERSON	and
Briand Ministries	ORGANIZATION	during the war , wrote in L'Humanite on
April 25	DATE	: President
Wilson	PERSON	, why have we waited so long ?

		Despair follows , as you well know , on hope deferred .

		We are tired of listening in vain .

		Have you not had occasion to intervene in the Fiume question ?

		Can you not see the great standing armies rising again in spite of your promises ?

		Was not the ferocious appetite of conquest roused and threartening ?

		Why did you not sooner appeal to the conscience of the
Nations	ORGANIZATION	, in which was your strength ?

		Why did you so long endure that we should
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 589 be thrown back under the rule of the old Diplomacy ?

		Have you not read that interview given by the Gen - eralissimo of the Allied armies ?

		The French paper that reproduced it was seized , but surely you have read it and have thought upon it and understood its full mean - ing ?

		Is it not more intolerable in your sight that in the name of
France	LOCATION	the
Rhine Frontier	ORGANIZATION	should be demanded in perpetuity than that
Italy	LOCATION	should demand an Italian town ?

		Now , since you have at last spoken , since you have gone straight to the peoples over the heads of their Governments , since you have broken that oppressive silence , will you not complete your task ?

		Speak once more ; tell us all your anxieties , your struggles , your aspirations and do not let us fall back once more into the silence of death .

		As
the Daily Herald	ORGANIZATION	said a few days ago , there is only one remedy for the tangle into which the
Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	has got itself to return to prin - ciples .

		It is because principles have been abandoned and appetities let loose that the tangle has come about .

		Only
America	LOCATION	can force the Conference to return to principles and a distracted
Europe	LOCATION	looks to you and to Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	to do it .

		Every coun - try in
Europe	LOCATION	is seething with discontent and un - rest .

		In
Belgium	LOCATION	there is bitter resentment against the Allies , especially
France	LOCATION	, on account of the neglect with which Belgian requirements are being treated .


Belgium	LOCATION	has been sacrificed to the cause ` of the Allies , she has been occupied by the enemy for nearly five years , her industry is ruined , she is bankrupt , and the majority of the population are out of work .

		Now that the victory is won , she is treated as a negligible quantity and put on a level with
Haiti	LOCATION	and
Uruguay	LOCATION	, although before the war she was economically a more important country than
Italy	LOCATION	.

		A detestably selfish policy has been followed toward her at the
Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	by certain Al - lied Governments , and the Belgians allege that the French Government is intriguing against them in
Luxembourg	LOCATION	.

		If the Allied Governments wished to see Bolshevism triumphant all over
Europe	LOCATION	, they would not have acted otherwise than they have .

		There is a general strike in a great French pro- vincial town , which neither the French nor
English Press	ORGANIZATION	has been allowed to mention .

		The
French Socialist Party	ORGANIZATION	has become once more definitely rev - olutionary ;
M. Albert Thomas	PERSON	and
M. Renaudel	PERSON	have signed an electoral program which declares that a revolution is necessary and that it will prob - ably begin with a temporary dictatorship of the proletariat .

		This program was accepted last week by the whole of the
National Congress	ORGANIZATION	except the extreme left , which did not consider it suf - ficiently advanced .

		The Party decided to affiliate itself only temporarily to what is called the
Second International	ORGANIZATION	, which recently met at
Berne	LOCATION	, on con - dition that it purge itself of
M. Vandervelde	PERSON	,
M. Branting	PERSON	, and other Socialists that are compromising with bourgeois governments , that it return to the class war and irreconcilable opposition to bourgeois parties and governments , and that it follow the example of
Russia	LOCATION	,
Hungary	LOCATION	, and
Germany	LOCATION	by im - mediately orientating the International towards the social revolution .

		If these conditions are not com - plied with it is probable that the
French Socialist Party	ORGANIZATION	will adhere to the
Third International	ORGANIZATION	founded by the Russian Bolsheviks , to which the Italian and
Swiss Socialist Party	ORGANIZATION	are already affiliated .

		In its manifesto which has already been mentioned the French Socialist Party denounces the conditions of Peace imposed on
Germany	LOCATION	as being '' calculated to reduce the German people to slavery , '' expresses its sympathy with the
Russian Revolution	ORGANIZATION	, condemns the policy of the Allies in regard to
Russia	LOCATION	, and instructs the Socialist deputies to vote against the budget and all military and civil credits on pain of exclusion from the party .

		I have already quoted the declaration of the party about the war , which it attributes to the '' imperialism and nationalism of all the European States small and great . ''

		Such are some of the events that are happening in
Europe	LOCATION	while our statesmen and our diplomatists squabble over frontiers and scraps of territory .

		The gods , one would imagine , must have marked them for destruction : unfortunately they may also involve others than themselves in their ruin .

		59 THE DIAL
June 14 Finland	DATE	A Bulwark Against Bolshevism .

		HE war which was to make the world safe for democracy has come to a fitting close .

		The de facto government of
Finland	LOCATION	has been recognized in almost the same breath that acclaimed the monarchist elements in
Western Siberia	LOCATION	.

		Scarcely was the announcement made when the ambassador of the present Finnish government disembarked on the shores of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The regime he represents has on its own confession thrown Finnish citizens into jail by the thousands , and has denied the ordinary rights of participation in politics to thousands more .

		It is altogether fitting and proper that the elder statesmen of the Quai d'Orsay should recognize
Finland	LOCATION	for what it is worth .

		The basis of the recognition is what makes the act interesting .

		From the beginning of the great war
Finland	LOCATION	has been a disaffected country .

		National struggles and class struggles have been perplexingly inter - mingled , for the reason that
Finland	LOCATION	is a zone of contact where the Slavic and Teutonic civilizations , one moving eastward and one westward , meet ; and in general the common people of
Finland	LOCATION	seem to have been the victims of two contentious foreign ruling classes , who have now compromised their differences for the laudable purpose of keeping the mass of Finlanders in subjection .

		General Man - nerheim himself sums up in his personal inheritance the main characteristics of the present ruling classes .

		Born in
Finland	LOCATION	, of Teutonic Junker stock , and trained in
Russia	LOCATION	under the Czarist regime , he brings to the government of his native land an enviable equipment in cruelty , arrogance , rapacity , and chicane .

		To the degree that he fails to repre - sent the Finnish people he represents the more adequately ` the present government .

		At the beginning of the wat the ruling classes turned with a single mind to
Germany	LOCATION	for aid in throwing off the incubus of Russian bureaucracy .

		Volunteers were enlisted for training under German military discipline , and preparations were made to attach the conduits of power to a switch manipu - lated in
Berlin	LOCATION	.

		The Finnish ruling classes realized that without the intervention of an alien military government they were impotent .

		For ever since the revolution of
1905	DATE	the common people of Fin - land had drifted toward Socialism , and but for the timely intervention of the Czar , popular govern - ment , through a coalition of peasants and workers , would have swept the tax-collecting classes into limbo .

		Hence the dual character of Finnish nation - alism .

		To the worker it meant freedom to par - ticipate in the international class struggle ; to the moneyed classes it meant the guarantee of their personal ascendancy within the national domain .

		How specious was the ruling classes ' fear of Russification became apparent as soon as the
Keren	PERSON	- sky regime was established in
Russia	LOCATION	.

		The Finnish Socialists were then in the majority , as against all the conservative parties in combination , and in
July 1917	DATE	they promptly seized the opportunity to de - clare
Finland	LOCATION	's political separation from
Russia	LOCATION	.


Germany	LOCATION	was not yet in a position to play its ap - pointed role in the domination of the Finnish prole - tariat , and the Allies were still -LRB- nominally -RRB- op - posed to Prussian methods of rule .

		Accordingly the conservative parties joined issue with the Socialists on the question of independence , and were able to stall the works successfully by procuring a dissolution of the Diet .

		Then four months of political frustration followed .

		Just as the new parliament was about to meet in
November	DATE	the overthrow of the first Russian republic took place , and the reins of government fell into the hands of unmistakably proletarian groups , functioning through the Soviets .

		Instantly the Finnish home rule problem was turned upside down .

		The Socialist party now declared its adherence to
Soviet Russia	LOCATION	, and the conservatives resuscitated their project for national independence .

		Up to this time the Finnish Socialist party had limited its activities to the established parliamentary fields .

		It had worked cautiously , and with that rigorous internal discipline so characteristic of continental Socialism .

		Protection to labor and the eight-hour day and equal suffrage for municipalities were the measures it demanded the sort of thing even a
Republican Congress	ORGANIZATION	might pass under the whip of a Democratic president .

		The small conr servative majority in the
November	DATE	Diet refused to consider these apparently innocent demands , and in consequence of their refusal the
Socialist Party	ORGANIZATION	, operating with the federation of labor unions , de - clared a general strike
November 15 , 1917	DATE	.

		The result was civil war , accompanied by the usual manifestation of violence , bloodshed , and disorder .

		During this period the Red Guard had the upper hand , and acts were committed by isolated groups of the baser sort , breaking loose from restraint , which the Finnish Socialist party does not attempt to palliate .

		The number of people killed has been variously estimated .

		In the book compiled from official documents by Dr.
Henning Soderhjelm	PERSON	the actual tally is 624 , and the most biased estimates do not mount much above a thousand .

		It is well
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 59 1 to remember these figures for the purpose of com - parison , and to bear in mind that they were not executions by a government but the work of mobs which had defied their government .

		The immediate outcome of this general strike was a success .

		The
Agrarian Party	ORGANIZATION	swung over to the Socialists , and the bills which the Socialists had presented were enacted .

		But the Socialist measures were passed only to be delayed , and they were de - layed only to cause another general strike .

		As a. result , civil strife broke out again in
January 1918	DATE	, with a Red government establishing itself in the towns of the south , and the White Guard organiz - ing itself under General
Mannerheim	PERSON	in the im - pregnable morasses of the north .

		Left to themselves , the Whites were defeated .

		From this time on the fate of popular govern - ment in
Finland	LOCATION	was bound up with the general situation in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		First came the '' peace '' treaty of Brest-Litovsk .

		There the representatives of the White elements appeared in order to give their sanction to the dismemberment and prostration of
Soviet Russia	LOCATION	, and to extend an invitation to the German imperialists to combat the '' menace of Bolshevism '' by invading
Finland	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- This White government was incidentally recognized by
France	LOCATION	at the same time a significant preface to present day politics . -RRB-

		Now ,
Finland	LOCATION	contains scarcely more than 3,200,000 inhabitants , and only a relatively small military force , well munitioned and victualed , was needed to destroy the ill-organized Red Guards .

		In ` the
spring Mannerheim	DATE	's troops pressed down from the north , and von der
Goltz	PERSON	's army estab - lished its base and moved upward , and between them the people 's government of
Finland	LOCATION	was macerated out of existence .

		The pre-revolutionary voting strength of the Finnish Socialist Party was above 370,000 .

		This body was the backbone < of the revolution , and consequently the mainstay of the people 's govern - ment .

		An autocrat , under no matter what czar he had perfected his education , could not rule a coun - try while such a large body of people were robust in health , sound in mentality , disciplined in leader - ship , and undiminished in numerical strength .

		Nevertheless
Mannerheim	PERSON	intended to rule , and the kept classes were unanimous in seconding his inten - tion .

		To achieve military power was one thing : to suppress all political rivalry was another .

		Thanks to
Mannerheim	PERSON	's sound training under the ancient regime , he was able to combat that infirmity in dealing with the masses which is so constant a source of instability in a capitalist government tainted by the most ordinary standards of human decency .

		The details of
Mannerheim	PERSON	's methods have no place outside the police court records of sanguinary crime , or the psychoanalyst 's monograph on the phenomenon of sadism .

		Wholesale imprisonment and widespread summary execution represent but the superficial aspects of his attempt to suppress popular -LRB- social-democratic -RRB- government .

		According to a report of representatives of all the Scandinavian Socialist parties , conditions in the camps for the detention of Red prisoners have been indescribably horrible .

		Starvation and filth have accomplished in slow inexorable fashion what lead and steel do hap - pily in a shorter period .

		This report is corroborated by the independent testimony of a correspondent of the New Statesman -LRB-
London	LOCATION	-RRB- , in a communication dated
February 1919	DATE	.

		He adds the systematic em - ployment , of torture for the purpose of obtaining evidence to the list of the present government 's crimes .

		These statements are now confirmed by an indisputably respectable authority .

		On the admis - sion of the official head of the
Finnish Economic Mission	ORGANIZATION	, published in the
New York	LOCATION	Times for
May 24	DATE	, '' the White Guards ` took 70,000 prisoners and promptly put them on trial , '' condemned a '' few '' to death , and gave more than 8,000 sentences of more than eight years in prison .

		1 Hence the estimates of the representative of the
People 's Government	ORGANIZATION	in
America	LOCATION	do not require any stretch of the imagination to become credible .

		Given in round numbers , they err on the side of conservatism .

		Executed : 10,000 .

		Died in prison : 10,000 .

		Exiled : 50,000 .

		The New Statesman correspondent is probably nearer the correct figure when he asserts that be - tween 15,000 and 20,000 were shot out of hand without any form of trial , and that not less than 13,000 and not more than 18,000 met death in the notorious prison camps between
June	DATE	and
October 1918	DATE	through lack of food and water .

		In all about 100,000 Socialists out of a total electorate of 900,000 have been either killed or disfranchised .

		Naturally those who were promptly executed were the leaders in the Finnish Socialist movement , educated for their positions by more than a decade of slow - parliamentary experiment .

		Hence when the chief of the
Finnish Economic Mission	ORGANIZATION	informs us that the erstwhile rank and file Socialists are '' bitter against the leaders who deserted them , '' it is plain that he uses the word '' desert '' in a pecu - liarly Pickwickian , or diplomatic sense .

		With thousands of their fellows killed , their leaders executed or exiled , their funds gone , their most active members imprisoned , their journals sup - pressed , their political activity curtailed , one would 59 2 THE DIAL
June 14	DATE	suppose that the Finnish Socialists might well weaken in enthusiasm for their creed .

		For theirs was a martyrdom without the consolations of eternal beatitude .

		The statistics of the latest elec - tion prove otherwise .

		The new Socialist repre - sentatives number 80 out of a total of 200 , and when due allowance is made for the starved , the executed , the exiled , and the jailed it appears that the Party has positively gained in strength under persecution .

		Notwithstanding their position , the Socialists are not represented in the present govern - ment , and as long as the dictatorship of Manner - helm continues with the connivance and subsidy of the Big Four practically one-half of the popu - lation of
Finland	LOCATION	will be living under an alien and autocratic rule .

		We have now reached a point where it is pos - sible to estimate what recognition of
Finland	LOCATION	by the Allies implies .

		Primarily it carries on an im - portant governmental tradition continuity of policy .

		The Allies have stepped into the place `` vacated by the defeated autocracy of
Germany	LOCATION	, and .

		- are supporting the methods so ably developed by the Mannerheim-Vbn der
Goltz	PERSON	regime .

		This sup - port has been of threefold nature : financial , muni - tionary , and moral .

		As for the first , it is pretty well authenticated that a shipment of gold , intended to stiffen the Kerensky regime before the American government realized that the first republic was on its last legs , was halted before it reached
Russia	LOCATION	, and that it has since been diverted into the channels of such law and order as White Terror stands for .

		Since the debacle of
Germany	LOCATION	the munitions have naturally been supplied from Allied sources , includ - ing
America	LOCATION	, and the British fleet has gone so far as to contribute naval support to military operations around the Baltic .

		This has strengthened the in - ternal control of the counter-revolutionists , and has made possible an interventionist campaign in
Russia	LOCATION	.

		Finally , the Allies have backed these material con - tributions with a '' moral '' offensive .

		They have taken the opportunity through the daily press to whitewash the sanguinary exploits of the
White Guard	ORGANIZATION	, and to reinforce this expression of approval by diplomatic recognition of the government which this guard keeps in power .

		Thus the perpetrators of a wholesale reign of terror were received openly into the ranks of the defenders of
Belgium	LOCATION	against the iron rule of
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Doubtless they will prove to be valuable adjuncts to the present
League of Governments	ORGANIZATION	.

		The story of the White Terror discloses the manifest unfitness of the
Mannerheim	PERSON	government to rule
Finland	LOCATION	.

		Was it in spite of this unfitness or because of it that the Allies have bolstered it up ?

		The question becomes pertinent when one inquires unfitness for what ?

		Unfitness obviously for asso - ciation with free peoples , with governments that exist by the consent of the governed , with those that deny that there is any necessary nexus between might and right .

		But the covert clique of govern - ments that has taken unto itself the task of con - trolling the world is not concerned with these old - fashioned liberal shibboleths .

		It exists to keep the economic status quo intact , and it is willing to utilize any more or less powerful group which has the same end in view .

		All the better if in the
Baltic	LOCATION	region the Allied governments can supply munitions , money , and moral authority , and allow the hired forces of the Junker-capitalist groups to do the dirty work .

		There is an obvious fitness in the
Mannerheim	PERSON	government for the commission of the sanguinary task of extirpation imposed upon it by the logic of the situation in
Russia	LOCATION	.


Finland	LOCATION	is a bulwark against Bolshevism : the stronger the present gov - ernment becomes , the stronger grows this bulwark .

		With plenty of material equipment , such for ex - ample as the famous Lewisite exterminator now in the hands of the
United States Government	ORGANIZATION	, there is no reason to suppose that a White Guard in - vading
Russia	LOCATION	should not be able to live up to its past performances , and possibly -LRB- for Lewisite seems to make it possible -RRB- to go beyond its best achieve - ments in the way of butchery and torture .

		Three million Soviet adherents in slavery , and three hun - dred thousand ready for execution , would represent the scale of extermination and suppression conform - able to the requirements of the Russian situation .

		Doubtless the Soviet system could be swiftly prostrated by such an application of Finnish law and order , and a gentlemen 's government , consist - ing of the remaining population -LRB- if any -RRB- could be erected , in accordance with the principles of self - determination , nationality , and democracy .

		Apparently the Prussic spirit is unconquerable .

		It has left the corpse of
Germany	LOCATION	only to enter the governments of the Allies .

		In
Germany	LOCATION	however it had the decency to expose the nakedness of its brutality , whilst with the Allies it is petticoated in President 's English .

		The situation about the Baltic throws a white light upon that struggle of nations which is also a struggle of classes .

		By means of its illumination we can penetrate the '' hypocrisies and patent cheats and masks of brute force '' and realize how far the economically autocratic democracies , led by
America	LOCATION	, have fallen from their grand and utterly unfulfilled aim of setting the world free .

		LEWIS
MUMFORD	ORGANIZATION	.

		1919 THE DIAL 593 Turmoil in
Spain	LOCATION	O PAIN is IN UPHEAVAL today through the con - temporaneous maturing of two great movements , each aiming at a transformation of the political and social order of the nation .

		The `` one is called in
Spain	LOCATION	the '' regionalist '' movement ; the other , the Spanish manifestation of the same social unrest which is sweeping the world , is industrial in char - acter and aims at nothing less than the social revolu - tion .

		The repressive measures now being taken in
Barcelona	LOCATION	against the syndicalistic and revolutionary socialist agitators , coming as they do on the heels of the spectacular political events of
December	DATE	and
January	DATE	, make confusion between the two move - ments very easy when they are viewed from abroad ; all the more since the regionalist movement is itself a very complex one , taking on different aspects in different places and provoking in each case different reactions on the part of the various political parties in
Spain	LOCATION	.

		The '' regionalist '' movement , as a whole , is a concerted attack on the Spanish bureaucratic gov - ernment centralized in
Madrid	LOCATION	.

		It is , in other words , a political movement , aiming at a decentral - ization of governmental control by a recognition of the great historic '' regions '' of
Spain	LOCATION	, to be erected into autonomous , or even into independent states , with the national unity entrusted to a system of federalization of some form or other .

		In two regions , particularly , this agitation for regional autonomy is intensified by a local nationalistic propaganda of more or less ancient origin .

		The Basques and the Catalonians , by virtue of their non-Spanish language , literature , and race , are appealing to the principle of self-determination for '' oppressed '' nationalities .

		The enthusiasm thus imparted to the movement in these regions has made it powerful enough to become an issue throughout the whole peninsula , where the problem of bureaucratic maladministration is just as serious as in the Basque provinces or in
Catalunya	LOCATION	.

		The '' Spanish , '' as opposed to the Basque and Cat - alonian , autonomist program is , in fact , only a device of the Spanish constitutional parties to find a form - ula whereby the dissatisfaction with the present monarchy general throughout the country may be removed , while at the same time making all possible concessions to
Basque	LOCATION	and Catalonian nationalism .

		The '' Spanish '' movement , lacking the separatist patriotic animus , aims simply at a political reorgan - ization of the nation , as the basis of a moral and social renovation of government in
Spain	LOCATION	.

		The proposed reorganization is however radical enough to arouse determined opposition in bureaucratic circles , and in all those social groups , the aristocracy , the clergy , the army , which most directly profit by the present system of centralization .

		The Spanish monarchy is of the approved constitutional type .

		The King governs in name only , while the real '' government '' rests in a cabinet , responsible to the Cortes , which is in turn elected by a universal and obligatory suffrage for men over twenty-five .

		While the age limit for voting might seem rather high , a very considerable case can be made out for the democratic character of the Spanish constitution .

		In actual operation the constitution does not show all the virtues it seems to promise on paper .

		The cabinet has control of the entire administration of the country through its power of appointment to the executive offices of the state , the political provinces , and the larger municipalities .

		This power it is able to exercise in controlling , not only the vote of the deputies to the Cortes , but also the local election machinery .

		Hence political '' bossism '' on the one hand ; and on the other a spoils system which makes politics a matter of group warfare and compromise , rather than a conflict of ideas .

		A defect of theory also develops in this mechanism as it radiates over the
Peninsula	LOCATION	and encounters the thirteen ancient geographical , economic , and social regions , differing in habits , interests , traditions , and even in language , out of which the modern Spanish state has been con - structed and of which only the two Castilles and
Andalucia	LOCATION	may properly be called
Spain	LOCATION	.

		For the centralized government operates through gen - eral laws and regulations applicable to the nation as a whole .

		In order thus to satisfy its specific indi - vidual needs , a given locality or region must appeal to the central government , where it meets not only bureaucratic inefficiency or rapacity , but also the con - flicting interests of other regions , each competing for special favors and each jealous of regional discrimin - ations .

		The Spanish regionalists contend that these evils can be corrected by reconstituting the government from the bottom up .

		They would , first of all , abolish the present forty-nine political and adminis - trative provinces , which date from
1833	DATE	.

		Then they would establish complete municipal autonomy , build up from representatives of the municipalities a par - liament to govern each of the thirteen ancient '' re - gions , '' and finally reach the state government , whose functions would be strictly limited to inter - regional , as we would say , interstate , affairs .

		Ex - treme regionalists would make participation in this central government on the part of the regions op - 594 THE DIAL
June 14	DATE	tional , and at all times free .

		Others would give greatest strength to the national unity .

		In the one case , we should get a state as loosely centralized as the British Empire ; in the other a union as compact as that of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		This program finds its major support in the so - called parties of the left , the Reformists , the Re - publicans and Radicals , the Socialists .

		Since
1898	DATE	, moreover , the government parties , Liberal and Con - servative , have been progressively inclined to con - cessions in the direction of these proposed reforms .

		They have never gone much farther , however , than a proposal of municipal autonomy coupled with gen - eral changes in systems of appointment and election , judicial procedure , and methods of taxation .

		While doubtless the bureaucracy could thus com - promise at almost any time with the '' Spanish '' re - gionalist movement , it has never been able to pacify the nationalists of Catalunya with such superficial changes .

		All the forces of discontent which operate in
Spain	LOCATION	generally rage with particular violence in the region of
Barcelona	LOCATION	,
Gerona	LOCATION	,
Tarragona	LOCATION	, and
Lerida	LOCATION	.

		These districts , owing to their wealth in water power , have a monopoly of the cotton-textile industries in
Spain	LOCATION	.

		With one-tenth of the total population of the nation ,
Catalunya	ORGANIZATION	pays one-fifth of the taxes , buys one-half of the imports , and sells one - third of the exports of the whole nation .

		No amount of special legislation on the part of
Madrid	LOCATION	has ever reconciled the Catalonians to the control by the central government of these great and separate in - terests .

		This stubbornness is the product of an idealistic middle class movement , now nearly a century old .

		We do not make it older than that for several reasons : first of all ,
Catalunya	PERSON	has been , since the twelfth century , identified with the destinies of the rest of
Spain	LOCATION	.

		Furthermore , the autonomy she now demands is not the autonomy she lost in
1715	DATE	.

		But more important still , the present fervor of national - ism among the
Catalans	ORGANIZATION	is of nineteenth century manufacture and has gone through the same pro- cess of development , which , since the French Revo - lution , has characterized all nationalisms .

		In the
first half of the past century	DATE	, Catalonian national - ism was a matter of philological and anthropological research .

		Philologists discovered the distinctness of the Catalan dialect , its affiliations with
Southern France	LOCATION	, the Provencal type of its literature .

		From the pedants the patriotic torch - passed , after the `` Floral Games '' of
1858	DATE	, into the hands of the poets .

		Between
1860	DATE	and
1880	DATE	we have to seek in Catalan literature the nearer origins of a def - initely anti-Spanish spirit .

		The years between
1880	DATE	and
1898	DATE	we may distinguish as the political era of Catalan nationalism .

		Then political societies began to flourish , with declarations of independence and programs for regional autonomy .

		Not less than ten predecessors to the recent petition of
November 25	DATE	are to be counted in these years , the most important being that signed at
Manresa	ORGANIZATION	in
1892	DATE	.

		After the crisis in Catalonian industry , resulting from the Cuban and Spanish-American war , the nationalistic movement assumed its present industrial character , industrial , that is , in the Spanish sense of the term .

		For since that time , the nationalistic sentiment has been identified with the cause of prosperity , protec - tion , and the full dinner-pail .

		It has won to its side the important industrial capitalists and large ele - ments among the business and working classes .

		At no time however has it interested those proletarian energies which are now concentrated in the agita - tions of the
Syndicalist Union	ORGANIZATION	or the revolutionary
General Federation of Labor	ORGANIZATION	.

		The present
Catalan League	ORGANIZATION	represents the fusion of Conservatives , Lib - erals , Reformists , Radicals , Republicans , and Social - ists .

		To the left of this it does not go .

		As compared with the Catalonian movemen.t , the Basque agitation for regionalism presents only the distinctive trait that in the Basque Provinces power - ful Carlist elements , of clerical and definitely reac - tionary tendencies , seem to have taken control of the movement in some localities .

		The impulse here is the same that translates itself in
France	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	into the demand for proportional representation .

		Various local majorities expect , through regional autonomy , to make good a power they can never hope to realize as a weak national minority .

		Both the Basque and the Catalonian demands would be satisfied with the extreme program of the Spanish regionalists .

		Neither movement , that is , is strictly separatist in character .

		In fact , the petition of
last November	DATE	is , in this respect , less radical than the constitution of
1892	DATE	.

		The same reservation applies to the question of the monarchy .

		Since
1898	DATE	, the Catalan movement has known moments when the republicans were in a majority .

		As a whole , the Catalanists could not regard the monarchy as incom - patible with any form of autonomy which would def - initely rid them of bureaucratic control from Mad - rid .

		The Basque movement meanwhile has power - ful enemies of the present dynasty , who prefer however something still more reactionary and absolutistic .

		The regionalist movement , in its three aspects , bears thus only a tactical relation to the revolution - ary labor movement , which is as hostile to the re - gionalist programs of political reform as it is to the centralized government .

		The subversive
General Federation of Labor	ORGANIZATION	usually finds , that is , in the con - ditions of passive regional resistance to the govern - ment , a favorable opportunity for revolutionary
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 595 agitation and for a general strike .

		On the other hand the regionalists utilize the threat of such in - dustrial troubles to coerce the government , which just as stolidly is inclined to retort by masking gen - eral repression of regionalist propaganda behind its assault on '' anarchy . ''


Francisco Ferrer	PERSON	is only the most celebrated victim of such tactics .

		The best disciplined groups of industrial revolu - tionists are in
Catalunya	LOCATION	and
Andalucia	LOCATION	.


Barcelona	LOCATION	contributes about 65,000 members to the revolution - ary
Federation	ORGANIZATION	, while about three thousand more come from
Lerida	LOCATION	,
Gerona	LOCATION	,
Tarragona	LOCATION	, and the agri - cultural regions .

		Not over forty thousand paid up members report to the Federation centers in An - dalucia , with the strongest groups in
Seville	LOCATION	,
Cordoba	LOCATION	,
Cadiz	LOCATION	, and
Malaga	LOCATION	.

		These figures , the latest issued by the
Federation	ORGANIZATION	, are based on reports of
1911	DATE	.

		Since
1915	DATE	, new sections have been formed in
La Corunya	LOCATION	,
Sarragossa	LOCATION	,
Valencia	LOCATION	,
Gijon	LOCATION	, and La Felguera .

		The Woodworkers and
Builders of Bilbao	ORGANIZATION	and the Glass Workers of
Madrid	LOCATION	are sep - arately organized but are affiliated with the
Fed	ORGANIZATION	- eration .

		Solidariedad Obrera , the organ of the
Fed	ORGANIZATION	- eration , claims at present a total of 107,000 ad - herents for the whole group .

		But its action is not by any means so limited as these figures , or its open organization , would imply .

		In the
last four months	DATE	there have been general strikes in
Lugo	LOCATION	,
Burgos	PERSON	,
Badajoz	LOCATION	, and Valladolid of '' bolshevik '' character , though these localities are not claimed by the revo - lutionary organization .

		These figures suggest , not so much weakness , as lack of discipline on the part of labor forces in
Spain	LOCATION	.

		We are doubtless witnessing only the begin - ning of a period of turmoil , which will be of prop - agandist , rather than reconstructive character , and tend to a compacter organization of the revolution - ary elements of the country .

		Of this trend the Gov - ernment has been perfectly aware .

		While it was meeting the regionalist agitation with a revised ver - sion of the
Maura	PERSON	proposal for local autonomy made in
1907	DATE	Maura was again chairman of the Extra -
Parliamentary Commission	ORGANIZATION	it was , under Roman - ces , meeting the revolutionary threat with the meas - ures of social reform well known to English and American liberalism .

		Along with lavish concessions in wages , working hours , and protection for working men , it was organizing labor in its own public utili - ties , and stimulating cooperative management be - tween owners and workers in private industries .

		In both of these tactics it could rely on a definite pre - ponderance of governmental forces .

		Meanwhile , however , the military clique accomplished during
April	DATE	what amounted to a seizure of the govern - ment , creating circumstances which compelled the resignation of Romanoes , and left labor face to face with military reaction in a situation which prom - ises still to seek something else than a political solution .

		Doubtless the present elections , the re - turns from which are just coming in , will show lib - eral forces strong enough to restrain the military and to conciliate the workers .

		The bureaucracy will find itself , when the present crisis passes , still in con - trol ; and the Spanish public will find itself in
Spain	LOCATION	in the presence of organized labor working in rela - tive harmony with organized capital .

		ARTHUR
LIVINGSTON	PERSON	.


India	LOCATION	's Revolution I N THE LIGHT of the evolutionary growth of revo - lutions and their constant approach to more ideal goals , it is of extreme interest to estimate the sig - nificance of the present revolution in
India	LOCATION	.

		This revolution has come out of desperation , and to the goal of absolute freedom it must go .

		Whether it succeeds now or not , it has already contributed a new and radical idea to the progress of humanity , which will be a permanent gift to international thought .

		This contribution comes , perhaps , nearer the goal of idealism than that of any other revolu - tion , because the contribution is that highly ideal - istic and inspiring one of passive resistance .

		In its inception , the Indian revolution was passive in character .

		Though in the latter stages it lost its original character and switched towards active resistance , yet it never lost sight of the spirit of passivism .

		Even the recourse to violence , forced upon the people by the British government , was more a protest against brutalities and barbarities committed on the unarmed and unfed masses by the alien autocrats .

		It was adopted only when they were not allowed to voice their silent protest against the alien laws that legalize and perpetuate the en - slavement of themselves one-fifth of humanity .

		The desire for freedom has been growing stronger and stronger day by day .

		In
1917	DATE	the British authorities recognized the revolutionary tendencies by the appointment of the
Rowlatt Commission	ORGANIZATION	to investigate revolutionary conspiracies in
India	LOCATION	.

		By this act alone they acknowledged the invalidity of their title to rule
India	LOCATION	against the will of her 315 millions of people .

		In
1919	DATE	, driven to desperation by the continued growth of the revolutionary move - ment , the
Government	ORGANIZATION	introduced the infamous Rowlatt Bills and had them passed against the 59 6 THE DIAL
June 14	DATE	unanimous voice of the Indian members of the Legis - lature Council who are , of course , in the minority .

		These Rowlatt Acts revived the Spanish Inquisition and the Star Chamber of the
Tudor	PERSON	and
Stuart	PERSON	period , in their worst forms .

		According to their provisions : 1 .

		Any Indian is subject to arrest without trial , upon suspicion , and detention without trial for an unlimited duration of time .

		2 .

		The burden of proof rests upon the accused .

		3 .

		The accused is kept ignorant of the names of his accusers and of witnesses against him .

		The accused is not confronted with his accusers or with witnesses against him , and is entitled only to a written account of the offenses attributed to him .

		4 .

		The accused is deprived of the help of a lawyer , and no witnesses are allowed in his defense .

		5 .

		The accused is given a secret trial , before a Com - mission of thr ^ ee High Court Judges , who may sit at any place they deem fit in a cellar if they choose .

		The method of their procedure or their findings may not be made public .

		6 .

		Trial by jury i & denied .

		The right of appeal is denied . ''

		No order under this Act shall be called into question in any court , and no suit or prosecution or other legal proceeding shall be made against any person for anything which is in good faith done or intended to be done under this Act . ''

		7 .

		The accused may be convicted of an offense with which he is not charged .

		8 .

		The prosecution '' shall not be bound to observe the rules of the law of evidence . ''

		Prosecution may accept evidence of absent witnesses .

		The witnesses may be dead , or may never have existed .

		9 .

		The authorities are given power to use '' any and every means '' in carrying out the law and in obtaining confessions .

		In other words , torture .

		10 .

		Any person possessing '' seditious '' documents , pic - tures or words , intending that the same shall be pub - lished or circulated , is liable to arrest and imprisonment .

		According to the definition of '' sedition , '' absence of affection for the British ` Government would be legally held to mean disaffection against it .

		11 .

		Men who have served prison terms for political offenses may be restricted to certain specific areas , must report regularly to the police , can not change address with - out notification of authorities , and must give securities for good behavior .

		They can never thereafter write on or discuss or attend meetings on any subject of public im - portance including even social , religious , and educational .

		12 .

		Any person -LRB- even the family -RRB- voluntarily associat - ing with an ex-political prisoner may be arrested and imprisoned .

		13 .

		Search without warrant of any suspected place or home is provided for .

		The people of
India	LOCATION	, led by that great passive resistance advocate , Mr.
M. K. Gandhi	PERSON	, and that spirited soul , Mrs.
Sarojini Naidu	PERSON	, raised their voice of protest by observing the
6th of April	DATE	as a national Day of Humiliation and Prayer .

		All over
India	LOCATION	shops were shut and general mourning was observed as a silent protest against the passage of the Rowlatt Bills .

		But undue interference of the authorities prevented them from even making a passive demon - stration of protest .

		Shops were opened at the point O ' f bayonets , passive resistance leaders were kid - napped and transferred to unknown destinations , and , according to the
London	LOCATION
Herald	ORGANIZATION	, twelve per - sons in one city were flogged for destroying govern - ment notices .

		For a number of days following the Day of Humiliation and Prayer , th ' e country was quiet .

		But suddenly , on
April	DATE	n , the whole of
India	LOCATION	, from
Bombay	LOCATION	to
Calcutta	LOCATION	and from
Kashmir	LOCATION	to
Madras	LOCATION	, went on a general strike .

		That day wit - nessed the greatest display of passivism the world has ever seen .

		People threw themselves in front of tram cars and moving trains , and succeeded in their attempts to induce their fellow-workers to stop work .

		They refrained from picketing and all other direct action .

		This extreme passive renunciation , the like of which is not to be found in the history of any country , brought in that extraordinary unanimity among all classes and all creeds .

		High and low , rich and poor ,
Hindu	PERSON	and Parsee ,
Mohammedan	PERSON	and Brahmin , were solidly united against the foreign rulers , for the emancipation of their
Motherland	LOCATION	.

		Hindus went to Moslem mosques and prayed along with their
Mohammedan	DATE	comrades in the orthodox
Mohammedan	DATE	style ; and the
Mohammedans	PERSON	went to the Hindu temples and prayed in the orthodox Hindu style , clasping the hands of their Hindu brothers as they knelt , praying for the same great ideal the freedom of
India	LOCATION	.

		Such a thing as this is unique ; it is possible only in
India	LOCATION	where freedom of toleration for differences of opinion exists in practice , and is not a dead letter .

		This fraterniza - tion of two widely different religious sects is a contribution to the real civilization which is to come , and
India	LOCATION	is well proud of it .

		Though the revolution may be suppressed by sheer brute force , still this contribution will live through all time .

		Even with this fraternization the British officials interfered .

		Mosques and Temples were ordered closed and surrounded by police and military guards .

		The people were forced to disperse by fire from machine guns and bombs from aeroplanes the '' civilized '' weapons of Christian nations .

		Naturally , as might have been expected in any other country , passive protest of the masses was ineffective , and the people , losing patience , resorted to active methods .

		They began destroying banks
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 597 and postoffices , demolishing government buildings , destroying bridges and means of communication , blowing up railway trains carrying troops to kill them , and attacking Englishmen .

		All this was by way of open challenge to the right of alien domina - tion and economic exploitation .

		It was at this juncture that Mr.
M. K. Gandhi	PERSON	called upon the people participating in the passive resistance movement to refrain from all further acts of violence , declaring that attacks upon Englishmen and other lawless acts constituted a blot on the movement for which the people should atone .

		He then fixed three days for fasting in atonement for acts of violence .

		And , according to the
London	LOCATION	Times for
April 25	DATE	, his followers did three days fasting as '' penance . ''

		But the situation was out of control .

		It became so serious that the Governor General , on the I4th of
April	DATE	, announced in unmistakable terms , that he was '' satisfied that a state of open rebellion '' existed in
India	LOCATION	.

		Thereafter , Mr.
Gandhi	PERSON	retired from the field , and the moderate elements the
Home Rulers	ORGANIZATION	rallied to the side of the
Government	ORGANIZATION	and denounced the movement , thus repeating the history of the Russian Revolution of
1905	DATE	.


New India	LOCATION	, however , had tasted of the cup of freedom and went on its march toward emancipa - tion .

		By the
2Oth of the month nearly half	DATE	of the entire country was placed under martial law .

		The following day the Governor General issued an ordi - nance ordering deportation to the
Andaman Islands	LOCATION	for life , or the extreme form of punishment , for political suspects tried under martial law .

		He for - bade the publication of all newspapers except those first passed upon and censored by government agents .

		Following the martial law order , all news from
India	LOCATION	, meager as it had always been , ceased .

		It was not until the Afghans on the northwestern frontier invaded
India	LOCATION	on the 9th of
May	DATE	that any news was permitted to reach
America	LOCATION	.

		The news stated that the Afghans were guarding the Khyber and
Bolan	PERSON	passes , the only two passes connecting
India	LOCATION	with
Afghanistan	LOCATION	, and through
Afghanistan	LOCATION	with
Russia	LOCATION	.

		The Afghans further sent a mission to
Moscow	LOCATION	, thereby violating the treaty of
1880	DATE	, by which the British had forced them to relinquish their right to treat independently with other nations .

		These facts are especially significant when we consider that the Afghans were supplied with ma - chine guns , apparently from some European source , and that Hindu revolutionists have been stationed in
Moscow	LOCATION	working with the
Russian Socialist Government	ORGANIZATION	since
November , 1917	DATE	.

		Furthermore , an article published in the
Bombay	LOCATION	Times of
April 1	DATE	5th stated that the
Bolsheviki	PERSON	had forwarded 25,000 sterling to
Bombay	LOCATION	.

		The same paper quoted a telegram from Helsingfors , in
March	DATE	, predicting the outbreak .

		News coming from
India	LOCATION	at the present time is very meager .

		But this is certain : the revolution is on , as also are the massacres perpetrated by the British on the masses atrocities compared with which German barbarities in
Belgium	LOCATION	sink to nothingness .

		These atrocities are carried on by the very power which ` has been given the '' mandatory '' of practically half the habitable world by the con - ference of old diplomats sitting at
Versailles	LOCATION	.

		This much is also certain :
Britain	LOCATION	will sacrifice much of that habitable area before she will give up
India	LOCATION	.

		She will give
China	LOCATION	to
Japan	LOCATION	, she will give up many of her other possessions , but desperate and bleeding
India	LOCATION	, and the route leading to
India	LOCATION	, she will hold by every means from diplomacy to liquid fire and poison gas .

		Whatever the outcome of the present revolution ,
India	LOCATION	has shown that it is not lagging behind any other nation in idealism and radicalism .

		The Hindus and Mohammedans have been cemented by the closest ties .

		Younger
India	LOCATION	has shown to the world what it desires and what it must have for self-existence .


India	LOCATION	has determined What it needs and it is also determined to get it .

		The people will not adopt violent means simply for the sake of violence .

		By birth and by heritage they abhor it , in practice as well as in theory .

		But if their passive efforts are met by active and brutal opposi - tion , they will not hesitate to adopt those measures for the time being , to smash to pieces all civilized Christian methods of subjection , and to smash them once for all .

		In idealism and radicalism
India	LOCATION	is not inferior to the inspired idealists of other countries .

		In some parts of the country the people are attempting to adopt communal ownership of land and property , and to revive their indigenous democratic village community system .

		They have succeeded in a few sections , such as in the
Punjab	LOCATION	, where the revolution has gained a strong foothold .

		The official press states that the '' fanatical '' Hindus are demanding expropriation of landlords , and communal owner - ship and control of the earth !

		It is true that these '' illogical '' and simple Hindus have always held that the land belongs to the people , and now they are determined to see that this becomes a reality .

		The social and economic ideals of the people to the north of the Himalayas are not new to the Hindus .

June 14	DATE	Propaganda in Schools A u - / -
AMERICA	LOCATION	s PART in the great war was just and needed no specious apology .

		Nevertheless the
Department of Education	ORGANIZATION	in
New York City	LOCATION	issued such an apology for use in the schools in the form of A Syllabus of the World War , with instructions to principals of high schools to present the docu - ment to all their pupils '' in the most efficient and inspiring manner '' to use the language of Mr. Et - tinger .

		All additional material , runs the notice to principals , must be `` approved by the principal be - , fore it is used in the class room . ''

		Apparently the purpose of this publication was to make clear to high-school students the nature of the German system against which we waged war and to ex - pound the reasons which induced our government to take up arms .

		In large part the pamphlet is confined to state - ments of fact which the most exacting historian will not question .

		Facts , however , do not always tell the whole truth .

		For example .

		This sylla - bus states : `` Great
Britain	LOCATION	responded -LSB- to
Belgium	LOCATION	's appeal in support of her integrity '' !

		with a note to
Germany	LOCATION	warning her to respect
Belgium	LOCATION	's neutral - ity , and when
Germany	LOCATION	, disregarding the warning , invaded
Belgium	LOCATION	, E `` ngland declared war ,
August	DATE	'' 4 . ''

		This is a truth , but not the whole truth .

		It implies that the invasion of
Belgium	LOCATION	was the cause of
Britain	LOCATION	's entrance an interpretation contrary to the plain record of the British WTiite Book .

		On
July 29	DATE	Sir
Edward Grey	PERSON	warned the Ger - man Ambassador in
London	LOCATION	not to be misled into assuming that
Great Britain	LOCATION	would stand aside in case
Germany	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	were involved in war ; on
July 30	DATE	he wrote to Sir
E. Goschen	PERSON	that Great '
Britain	LOCATION	would not bargain in the matter of Belgian neutrality ; on
July 31	DATE	he stated that the '' German government do not expect our neutrality '' ; on the same day he declared '' the preservation of the neu - trality of
Belgium	LOCATION	might be , I would not say a de - cisive , but an important factor in determining our attitude '' ; on
August 2	DATE	-LRB- before
Belgium	LOCATION	was in - vaded -RRB- he assured
M. Cambon	PERSON	that '' if the Ger - man fleet comes into the Channel or through the
North Sea	LOCATION	to undertake hostile operations against French coasts or shipping , the British fleet will give all protection in its power . ''

		Is it too much to say , therefore , that on this vital point the syllabus mis - leads teacher and student ?

		The account -LRB- page 42 -RRB- of the Russian Revolution is , to put it mildly , not warranted by any authentic records that have come through to us .

		To as - cribe Kerensky 's failure to '' the opposition of the extremists ,
Lenin	PERSON	and Trotzky , '' is too simple a solution for a highly complicated historical problem .

		Lenin and Trotzky are then accused of `` betraying ''
Russia	LOCATION	into the hands of the Germans .

		If this means anything , it means that
Lenin	PERSON	and Trotzky con - sciously and wilfully delivered
Russia	LOCATION	into the `` hands of the
Kaiser	PERSON	and his war lords .

		Even the strongest opponent of the
Lenin	PERSON	regime must admit : that this is at best merely an allegation .

		To raise it to the level of an established fact to be used in the school room is to fly in the face of all canons of historical evidence .

		The Brest-Litovsk treaty is represented as the wilful deed of these two leaders apparently conditions in
Russia	LOCATION	and the refusal of the Allies to render aid having nothing to do with it .

		Finally , by what warrant does the
Department of Education	ORGANIZATION	carry on a campaign among the school children of
New York	LOCATION	in support of universal mili - tary service as a permanent public policy -LRB- pages 67-71 -RRB- ?

		Surely it is a historical fact that general conscription stands upon the books as a temporary measure to meet a great emergency .

		The advocacy of universal service as a settled national policy is therefore nothing but propaganda wise , honorable , correct , let us admit for the sake of argument but nevertheless propaganda .

		Our schools , it would ap - pear , are not the places where conflicting views of future policy are to be fairly considered , but insti - tutions for propaganda .

		To sum up , this pamphlet , considered as a his - torial document , is no credit to the
Department of Education	ORGANIZATION	, and as a piece of patriotic argument will defeat its own purposes .

		America 's cause was just its defense needs no misuse of facts .

		What of the children whose minds are to be fashioned under this syllabus ?

		They can not be cut off from the public libraries where they may learn of things not included in the whole book of complete orthodoxy .

		This being so with boys and girls reading far and wide in many books and magazines , listening to many voices in the outside world will not the teacher who recites without comment this syllabus come to judgment and be confused and confounded in the presence of open - eyed and wondering youth ?

		Has the
Board of Education	ORGANIZATION	considered the moral effect of such a pre - dicament upon its teachers ?

		And where do the trained teachers of history stand ?

		Why was the preparation of this pamphlet taken from their hands and nothing but the igig THE DIAL 599 '' assistance '' of a few of them invited ?

		Are they to be mere phonographs reciting by rote lessons pre - pared and approved by superintendents and principals ?

		If so , of what use is their long special preparation their habits of research and truth-testing their knowledge of the use of documentary evidence ?

		Have we not the right to ask that history in the schools be entrusted to the collective body of trained his - torical teachers ?

		If this syllabus is what we are to expect from the public schools in the coming age , then we must look elsewhere for education .

		CHARLES A. BEARD .

		I
The Captains of Finance	ORGANIZATION	and the Engineers N MORE THAN ONE RESPECT the industrial system of today is notably different from anything that has gone before .

		It is eminently a system , self-balanced and comprehensive ; and it is a system of interlock - ing mechanical processes , rather than of skilful manipulation .

		It is mechanical rather than manual .

		It is an organization of mechanical powers and ma - terial resources , rather than of skilled craftsmen and tools ; although the skilled workmen and tools are also an indispensable part of its comprehensive mechanism .

		It is of an impersonal nature , after the fashion of the material sciences , on which it con - stantly draws .

		It runs to '' quantity production '' of specialized and standardized goods and services .

		For all these reasons it lends itself to systematic con - trol under the direction of industrial experts , skilled technologists , who may be called '' production engi - neers , '' for want of a better term .

		This industrial system runs on as an inclusive organization of many and diverse interlocking me - chanical processes , interdependent and balanced among themselves in such a way that the due work - ing of any part of it is conditioned on the due work - ing of all the rest .

		Therefore it will work at its best only on condition that these industrial experts , production engineers , will work together on a com - mon understanding ; and more particularly on con - dition that they must not work at cross purposes .

		These technological specialists whose constant super - vision is indispensable to the due working of the industrial system constitute the general staff of in - dustry , whose work it is to control the strategy of production at large and to keep an oversight of the tactics of production in detail .

		Such is the nature of this industrial system on whose due working depends the material welfare of all the civilized peoples .

		It is an inclusive system drawn on a plan of strict and comprehensive inter - dependence , such that , in point of material welfare , no nation and no community has anything to gain at the cost of any other nation or community .

		In point of material welfare , all the civilized peoples have been drawn together by the state of the in - dustrial arts into a single going concern .

		And for the due working of this inclusive going concern it is essential that that corps of technological specialists who by training , insight , and interest make up the general staff of industry must have a free hand in the disposal of its available resources , in materials , equipment , and man power , regardless of any na - tional pretensions or any vested interests .

		Any de - gree of obstruction , diversion , or withholding of any of the available industrial forces , with a view to the special gain of any nation or any investor , unavoid - ably brings on a dislocation of the system ; which involves a disproportionate lowering of its working efficiency and therefore a disproportionate loss to the whole , and therefore a net loss to all its parts .

		And all the while the statesmen are at work to divert and obstruct the working forces of this in - dustrial system , here and there , for the special ad - vantage of one nation and another at the cost of the rest ; and the captains of finance are working , at cross purposes and in collusion , to divert whatever they can to the special gain of one vested interest and another , at any cost to the rest .

		So it happens that the industrial system is deliberately handicapped with dissension , misdirection , and unemployment of material resources , equipment , and man power , at every turn where the statesmen or the captains of finance can touch its mechanism ; and all the civi - lized peoples are suffering privation together because their general staff of industrial experts are in this way required to take orders and submit to sabotage at the hands of the statesmen and the vested in - terests .

		Politics and investment are still allowed to decide matters of industrial policy which should plainly be left to the discretion of the general staff of production engineers driven by no commercial bias .

		No doubt this characterization of the industrial system and its besetting tribulations will seem over - drawn .

		However , it is not intended to apply to any date earlier than the twentieth century , or to any backward community that still lies outside the sweep of the mechanical industry .

		.

		Only gradually during the past century , while the mechanical in - 6oo THE DIAL
June 14	DATE	dustiy has progressively been taking over the pro- duction of goods and services , and going over to quantity production , has the industrial system taken on this character of an inclusive organization of interlocking processes and interchange of materials ; and it is only in the twentieth century that this cumulative progression has come to a head with such effect that this characterization is now , visibly becoming true .

		And even now it will hold true , visibly and securely , only as applies to the leading mechanical industries , those main lines of industry that shape the main conditions of life , and in which quantity production has become the common and indispensable rule .

		Such are , for examples : trans - port and communication , the production and indus - trial use of coal , oil , electricity and water power , the production of steel and other metals ; of wood pulp , lumber and other building materials ; of tex - tiles and rubber , as also grain-milling and much of the grain-growing , together with meat-packing and a good share of the stock-raising industry .

		There is , of course , a large volume of industry in many lines which has not , or only in part and doubtfully , been drawn into this network of mechanical processes and quantity production , in any direct and conclusive fashion .

		But these other lines of industry that still stand over on another and older plan of operation are , after all , outliers and subsidiaries of the mechanically organized in - dustrial system , dependent on or subservient to those greater underlying industries which make up the working body of the system , and which therefore set the pace for the rest .

		And in the main , there - fore , and as regards these greater mechanical in - dustries on whose due working the material welfare of the community depends from day to day , this characterization will apply without material abate - ment .

		But it should be added that even as regards these greater , primary and underlying , lines of production the system has not yet reached a fatal degree of close-knit interdependence , balance , and complica - tion ; it will still run along at a very tolerable effi - ciency in the face of a very appreciable amount of persistent derangement .

		That is to say , die in - dustrial system at large has not yet become so deli - cately balanced a mechanical structure and process that the ordinary amount of derangement and sabot - age necessary to the ordinary control of production by business methods will paralyze the whole out - right .

		The industrial system is not yet sufficiently close-knit for that .

		And yet , that extent and degree of paralysis from which the civilized world 's in - dustry is suffering just now , due to legitimate busi - nesslike sabotage , goes to argue that the date may not be far distant when the interlocking processes of the industrial system shall have become so closely interdependent and so delicately balanced that even the ordinary modicum of sabotage involved in the conduct of business as usual will bring the whole to a fatal collapse .

		The derangement and privation brought on by any well organized strike of the larger sort argues to the same effect .

		In effect , the progressive advance of this industrial system towards an all-inclusive mechanical balance of interlocking processes appears to be approaching a critical pass , beyond which it will no longer be practicable to leave its control in the hands of busi - ness men working at cross purposes for private gain , or to entrust its continued administration to others than suitably trained technological experts , pro- duction engineers without a commercial interest .

		What these men may then do with it all is not so plain ; the best they can do may not be good enough ; but the negative proposition is becoming sufficiently plain , that this mechanical state of the industrial arts will not long tolerate the continued control of production by the vested interests under the current businesslike rule of incapacity by advisement .

		In the beginning , that is to say during the early growth of the machine industry , and particularly in that new growth of mechanical industries which arose directly out of the Industrial Revolution , there was no marked division between the industrial experts and the business managers .

		That was be - fore the new industrial system had gone far on the road of progressive specialization and complexity , and before business had reached an exactingly large scale ; so that even the business men of that time , who were without special training in technological matters , would still be able to exercise something of an intelligent oversight of the whole , and to under - stand something of what was required in the mechanical conduct of the work which they financed and from which they drew their income .

		Not un - usually the designers of industrial processes and equipment would then still take care of the financial end , at the same time that they managed the shop .

		But from an early point in the development there set in a progressive differentiation , such as to divide those who designed and administered the industrial processes from those others who designed and man - aged the commercial transactions and took care of the financial end .

		So there also set in a correspond - ing division of powers between the business man - agement and the technological experts .

		It became the work of the technologist to determine , on technologi - cal grounds , what could be done in the way of pro-
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 601 ductive industry , and to contrive ways and means of doing it ; but the business management always continued to decide , on commercial grounds , how much work should be done and what kind and ^ quality of goods and services should be produced ; and the decision of the business management has always continued to be final , and has always set the limit beyond which production must not go .

		With the continued growth of specialization the experts have necessarily had more and more to say in the affairs of industry , but always their findings as to what work is to be done and what ways and means are to be employed in production have had to wait on the findings of the business managers as to what will be expedient for the purpose of com - mercial gain .

		This division between business management and industrial management has con - tinued to go forward , at a continually accelerated rate , because the special training and experience re - quired for any passably efficient organization and direction of these industrial processes has continu - ally grown more exacting , calling for special knowl - edge and abilities on the part of those who have this work to do and requiring their undivided in - terest and their undivided attention to the work in hand .

		But these specialists in technological knowledge , abilities , interest , and experience , who have increasingly come into the case in this way inventors , designers , chemists , mineralogists , soil ex - perts , crop specialists , production managers and engineers of many kinds and denominations have continued to be employees of the captains of in - dustry , that is to say , of the captains of finance , whose work it has been to commercialize the knowl - edge and abilities of the industrial experts and turn them to account for their own gain .

		It is perhaps unnecessary to add the axiomatic corollary that the captains have always turned the technologists and their knowledge to account in this way only so far as would serve their own com - mercial profit , not to the extent of their ability or to the limit set by the material circumstances or by the needs of the community .

		The result has been , uniformly and as a matter of course , that the production of goods and services has ad - visedly been stopped short of productive capacity , by curtailment of output and by derangement of the productive system .

		There are two main reasons for this , and both have operated together through - out the machine era to stop industrial production increasingly short of productive capacity , -LRB- a -RRB- ' The commercial need of maintaining a profitable price has led to an increasingly imperative curtailment of the output , as fast as the advance of the in - dustrial arts has enhanced the productive capacity .

		And -LRB- b -RRB- the continued advance of the mechanical technology has called for an ever-increasing volume and diversity of special knowledge , and so has left the businesslike captains of finance continually farther in arrears , so that they have been less and less capable of comprehending what is required in the ordinary way of industrial equipment and per - sonnel .

		They have therefore , in effect , maintained prices at a profitable level by curtailment of output rather than by lowering production-cost per unit of output , because they have not had such a work - ing acquaintance with the technological facts in the case as would enable them to form a passably sound judgment of suitable ways and means for lowering production-cost ; and at the same time , being shrewd business men , they have been unable to rely on the hired-man 's - loyalty of technologists whom they do not understand .

		The result has been a somewhat distrustful blindfold choice of processes and per - sonnel and a consequent enforced incompetence in the management of industry , a curtailment of output below the needs of the community , below the pror ductive capacity of the industrial system , and below what an intelligent control of production would have made commercially profitable .

		Through the earlier decades of the machine era these limitations imposed on the work of the ex - perts by the demands of profitable business and by .

		the technical ignorance of the business men , appears not to have been a heavy handicap , whether as a hindrance to the continued development of techno - logical knowledge or as an obstacle to its ordinary use in industry .

		That was before the mechanical industry had gone far in scope , complexity , and specialization ; and it was also before the continued ' work of the technologists had pushed the industrial system to so high a productive capacity that it is - forever in danger of turning out a larger product than is required for a profitable business .

		But gradually , with the passage of time and the ad - vance of the industrial arts to a wider scope and % larger scale , and to an increasing specialization and !

		standardization of processes , the technological know - ledge that makes up the state of the industrial arts has called for a higher degree of that training that makes industrial specialists ; and at the same time any passably efficient management of industry has of necessity drawn on them and their special abili - ties to an ever-increasing extent .

		At the same time and by the same shift of circumstances , the captains of finance , driven by an increasingly close applica - tion to the affairs of business , have been going farther out of touch with the ordinary realities of productive industry ; and , it is to be admitted , they have also continued increasingly to distrust the 602
June 14	DATE	technological specialists , whom they do not under - stand , but whom they can also not get along with - out .

		The captains have per force continued to em - ploy the technologists , to make money for them , but they have done so only reluctantly , tardily , sparingly , and with a shrewd circumspection ; only because and so far as they have been persuaded that the use of these technologists was indispensable to the mak - ing of money .

		One outcome of this persistent and pervasive tardiness and circumspection on the part of the captains has been an incredibly and increasingly uneconomical use of material resources , and an in - credibly wastful organization of ; equipment and man power in those great industries where the technological advance has been most marked .

		In good part it was this discreditable pass , to which the leading industries had been brought by these one-eyed captains of industry , that brought the regime of the captains to an inglorious close , by shifting the initiative and discretion in this domain out of their hands into those of the investment bankers .

		By custom the investment bankers had oc - cupied a position between or overlapping the duties of a broker in corporate securities and those of an underwriter of corporate flotations such a position , in effect , as is still assigned them in the standard writings on corporation finance .

		The increasingly large scale of corporate enterprise , as well as the growth of a mutual understanding among these business concerns , also had its share in this new move .

		But about this time , too , the '' consulting engineers '' were coming notably into evidence in many of those lines of industry in which corpora - tion finance has habitually been concerned .

		So far as concerns the present argument the or - dinary duties of these consulting engineers have been to advise the investment bankers as to the industrial and commercial soundness , past and pros - pective , of any enterprise that is to be underwritten .

		These duties have comprised a painstaking and im - partial examination of the physical properties in - volved in any given case , as well as an equally im - partial auditing of the accounts and appraisal of the commercial promise of such enterprises , for the guidance of the bankers or syndicate of bankers in - terested in the case as underwriters .

		On this ground working arrangements and a mutual understanding presently arose between the consulting engineers and those banking houses that habitually were con - cerned in the underwriting of corporate enterprises .

		The effect of this move has been two-fold : ex - perience has brought out the fact that corporation finance , at its best and soundest , has now become a matter of comprehensive and standardized bureau - cratic routine , necessarily comprising the mutual relations between various corporate concerns , and best to be taken care of by a clerical staff of trained accountants ; and the same experience has put the financial ` houses in direct touch with the technolo - gical general staff of the industrial system , whose surveillance has become increasingly imperative to the conduct of any profitable enterprise in industry .

		But also , by the same token , it has appeared that the corporation financier of nineteenth-century tradi - tion is no longer of the essence of the case in cor - poration finance of the larger and more responsible sort .

		He has , in effect , come to be no better than an idle wheel in the economic mechanism , serving only to take up some of the lubricant .

		Since and so far as this shift out of the nine - teenth century into the twentieth has been com - pleted , the corporation financier has ceased to be a captain of industry and has become a lieutenant of finance ; the captaincy having been taken over by the syndicated investment bankers and administered as a standardized routine of accountancy , having to do with the flotation of corporation securities and with their fluctuating values , and having also some - thing to do with regulating the rate and volume of output in those industrial enterprises which so have passed under the hand of the investment bankers .

		By and large , such is the situation of the in - dustrial system today , and of that financial business that controls the industrial system .

		But this state of things is not so much an accomplished fact handed on out of the recent past ; it is only that such is the culmination in which it all heads up in the im - mediate present , and that such is the visible drift of things into the calculable future .

		Only during the last few years has the state of affairs in industry been obviously falling into the shape so outlined , and it is even yet only in those larger and pace-making lines of industry which are altogether of the new technological order that the state of things has reached this finished shape .

		But in these larger and underlying divisions of the industrial system the present posture and drift of things is unmis - takable .

		Meantime very much still stands over out of that regime of rule-of-thumb , competitive sabot - age , and commercial log-rolling , in which the busi - nesslike captains of the old order are so altogether well at home , and which has been the best that the captains have known how to contrive for the man - agement of that industrial system whose captains they have been .

		So that wherever the production experts are now taking over the management , out of the dead hand of the self-made captains , and
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 603 wherever they have occasion to inquire into the established conditions of production , they find the ground cumbered with all sorts of incredible make - shifts of waste and inefficiency such makeshifts as would perhaps pass muster with any moderately stupid elderly layman , but which look like blind - fold guesswork to these men who know something of the advanced technology and its working-out .

		Hitherto , then , the growth and conduct of this industrial system presents this singular outcome .

		The technology the state of the industrial arts which takes effect in this mechanical industry is in an eminent sense a joint stock of knowledge and experience held in common by the civilized peoples .

		It requires the use of trained and instructed work - men born , bred , trained , and instructed at the cost of the people at large .

		So also it requires , with a continually more exacting insistence , a corps of highly trained and specially gifted experts , of divers and various kinds .

		These , too , are born , bred , and trained at the cost of the community at large , and they draw their requisite special knowledge from the community 's joint stock of accumulated ex - perience .

		These expert men , technologists , engineers , or whatever name may best suit them , make up the indispensable General Staff of the in - dustrial system ; and without their immediate and unremitting guidance and correction the industrial system will not work .

		It is a mechanically organized structure of technical processes designed , installed , and conducted by these production engineers .

		Without them and their constant at - tention the industrial equipment , the mechanical ap - pliances of industry , will foot up to just so much junk .

		The material welfare of the community is unreservedly bound up with the due working of this industrial system , and therefore with its un - reserved control by the engineers , who alone are competent to manage it .

		To do their work as it should be done these men of the industrial general staff must have a free hand , unhampered by com - mercial considerations and reservations ; for the pro- duction of the goods and services needed by the com - munity they neither need nor are they in a/iy de - gree benefited by any supervision or interference from the side of the owners .

		Yet the owners , now represented , in effect , by the syndicated investment bankers , continue to control the industrial experts and limit their discretion arbitrarily , for their own commercial gain , regardless of the needs of the com - munity .

		Hitherto these men who so make up the general staff of the industrial system have not drawn to - gether into anything like a self-directing working force ; nor have they been vested with anything more than an occasional , haphazard , and tentative con - trol of some disjointed sector of the industrial equip - ment , with no direct or decisive relation to that per - sonnel of productive industry that may be called the officers of the line and the rank and file .

		It is still the unbroken privilege of the financial management and its financial agents to '' hire and fire . ''

		The final disposition of all the industrial forces still remains in the hands of the business men , who still continue to dispose of these forces for other than industrial ends .

		And all the while it is an open secret that with a reasonably free hand the produc - tion experts would today readily increase the ordinary output of industry by several fold , variously estimated at some
300 per cent	MONEY	to
1200 per cent	MONEY	of the current output .

		And what stands in the way of so increasing the ordinary output of goods and services is business as usual .

		Right lately these technologists have begun to become uneasily '' class-conscious '' and to reflect that they together constitute the indispensable General Staff of the industrial system .

		Their class consciousness has taken the immediate form of a growing sense of waste and confusion in the manage - ment of industry by the financial agents .

		They are beginning to take stock of that all-pervading mis - management of industry that is inseparable from its control for commercial ends .

		All of which brings home a realization of their own shame and of damage to the common good .

		So the engineers are beginning to draw together and ask themselves , `` What about it ? ''

		This uneasy movement among the technologists set in , in an undefined and fortuitous way , in the closing years of the nineteenth cenutry ; when the consulting engineers , and then presently the '' effi - ciency engineers , '' began to make scattered correc - tions in detail , which showed up the industrial in - competence of those elderly laymen who were do - ing a conservative business at the cost of industry .

		The consulting engineers of the standard type , both then and since then , are commercialized tech - nologists , whose work it is to appraise the in - dustrial value of any given enterprise with a view to its commercial exploitation .

		They are a cross between a technological specialist and a commercial agent , beset with the limitations of both and com - monly not fully competent in either line .

		Their normal position is that of an employee of the in - vestment bankers , on a stipend or a retainer , and it has ordinarily been their fortune to shift over in time from a technological footing to a frankly commercial one .

		The case of the efficiency en - gineers , or scientific-management experts , is some - 604 THE DIAL
June 14	DATE	what similar .

		They too have set out to appraise , exhibit , and correct the commercial shortcomings of the ordinary management of those industrial es - tablishments which they investigate , to persuade the business men in charge how they may reason - ably come in for larger net earnings by a more closely shorn exploitation of the industrial forces at their disposal .

		During the opening years of the new century a lively interest centered on the views and expositions of these two groups of industrial ex - perts ; and not least was the interest aroused by their exhibits of current facts indicating an all-pervading lag , leak , and friction in the industrial system , due to its disjointed and one-eyed management by com - mercial adventurers bent on private gain .

		During these few years of the opening century the members of this informal guild of engineers at large have been taking an interest in this question of habitual mismanagement by ignorance and com - mercial sabotage , even apart from the commercial imbecility of it all .

		But it is the young rather than the old among them who see industry in any other light than its commercial value .

		Circumstances have decided that the older generation of the craft have become pretty well commercialized .

		Their habitual outlook has been shaped by a long and un - broken apprenticeship to the corporation financiers and the investment bankers ; so that they still habitu - ally see the industrial system as a contrivance for the round-about process of making money .

		Ac - cordingly , the established official
Associations and Institutes of Engineers	ORGANIZATION	, which are officered and engineered by the elder engineers , old and young , also continue to show the commercial bias of their creators , in what they criticize and in what they propose .

		But the new generation which has been coming on during the present century are not simi - larly true to that tradition of commercial engineer - ing that makes the technological man an awestruck lieutenant of the captain of finance .

		By training , and perhaps also by native bent , the technologists find it easy and convincing to size up men and things in terms of tangible performance , without commercial afterthought , except so far as their apprenticeship to the captains of finance may have made commercial afterthought a second nature to them .

		Many of the younger generation are be - ginning to understand that engineering begins and ends in the domain of tangible performance , and that commercial expediency is another matter .

		In - deed , they are beginning to understand that com - mercial expediency has nothing better to contribute to the engineer 's work than so much lag , leak , and friction .

		The four years ' experience of the war has also been highly instructive on that head .

		So they are beginning to draw together on a common ground of understanding , as men who are concerned with the ways and means of tangible performance in the way of productive industry , according to the state of the industrial arts as they know them at their best ; and there is a growing conviction among them that they together constitute the sufficient and indispensable general staff of the mechanical in - dustries , on whose unhindered team-work depends the due working of the industrial system and there - fore also the material welfare of the civilized peo - ples .

		So also , to these men who are trained in the stubborn logic of technology nothing is quite real that can not be stated in terms of tangible per - formance ; and they are accordingly coming to un - derstand that the whole fabric of credit and corpora - tion finance is a tissue of make-believe .

		Credit obligations and financial transactions rest on certain principles of legal formality which have been handed down from the
eighteenth century	DATE	, and which therefore antedate the mechanical in - dustry and carry no secure conviction to men trained in the logic of that industry .

		Within this technological system of tangible performance cor - poration finance and all its works and gestures are completely idle ; it all comes into the working scheme of the engineers only as a gratuitous intrusion which could be barred out without deranging the work at any point , provided only that men made up their mind to that effect that is to say , provided the make-believe of absentee ownership were discon - tinued .

		Its only obvious effect on the work which the engineers have to take care of is waste of materials and retardation of the work .

		So the next question which the engineers are due to ask regard - ing this timeworn fabric of ownership , finance , sabotage , credit , and unearned income is likely to be : Why cumbers it the ground ?

		And they are likely to find the scriptural answer ready to their hand .

		It would be hazardous to surmise how , how soon , on what provocation , and with what effect the guild of engineers are due to realize that they constitute a guild , and that the material fortunes of the civilized peoples * already lie loose in their hands .

		But it is already sufficiently plain that the industrial con - ditions and the drift of conviction among the en - gineers are drawing together to some such end .

		Hitherto it has been usual to count on the in - terested negotiations continually carried on and never concluded between capital and labor , between the agents of the investors and the body of workmen , to bring about whatever readjustments are to be looked for in the control of productive industry and in the distribution and use of its product .

		These
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 605 negotiations have necessarily been , and continue to be , in the nature of business transactions , bargain - ing for a price , since both parties to the negotiation continue to stand on the consecrated ground of ownership , free bargain , and self-help ; such as the commercial wisdom of the eighteenth century saw , approved and certified it all , in the time before the coming of this perplexing industrial system .

		In the course of these endless negotiations between the owners and their workmen there has been some loose and provisional syndication of claims and forces on both sides ; so that each of these two recognized parties to the industrial controversy has come to make up a loose-knit vested interest , and each speaks for its own special claims as a party in interest .

		Each is contending for some special gain for itself and trying to drive a profitable bargain for itself , and hitherto no disinterested spokesman for the community at large or for the industrial system as a going concern has cut into this controversy be - tween these contending vested interests .

		The out - come has been businesslike concession and com - promise , in the nature of bargain and sale .

		It is true , during the war , and for the conduct of the war , there were some half-concerted measures taken by the
Administration	ORGANIZATION	in the interest of the nation at large , as a belligerent ; but it has always been tacitly agreed that these were extraordinary war measures , not to be countenanced in time of peace .

		In time of peace the accepted rule is still business as usual ; that is to say , investors and workmen wran - gling together on a footing of business as usual .

		These negotiations have necessarily been inconclu - sive .

		So long as ownership of resources and in - dustrial plant is allowed , or so long as it is al - lowed any degree of control or consideration in the conduct of industry , nothing more substantial can come of any readjustment than a concessive mitiga - tion of the owners ' interference with production .

		There is accordingly nothing subversive in these bouts of bargaining between the federated workmen and the syndicated owners .

		It is a game of chance and skill played between two contending vested in - terests for private gain , in which the industrial sys - tem as a going concern enters only as a victim of in - terested interference .

		Yet the material welfare of - the community , and not least of the workmen , turns on the due ; working of this industrial system , with - out interference .

		Concessive mitigation of the right to interfere with production , on the part of either one of these vested interests , can evidently come to nothing more substantial than a concessive miti - gation .

		But owing to the peculiar technological character of this industrial system , with its specialized , standardized , mechanical , and highly technical inter - locking processes of production , there has gradually come into being this corps of technological produc - tion specialists , into whose keeping the due function - ing of the industrial system has now drifted by force of circumstance .

		They are , by force of circum - stance , the keepers of the community 's material wel - fare ; although they have hitherto been acting , in effect , as keepers and providers of free income for the kept classes .

		They are thrown into the position of responsible directors of the industrial system , and by the same move they are in a position to be - come arbiters of the community 's material welfare .

		They are becoming class-conscious , and they are no longer driven by a commercial interest , in any such degree as will make them a vested interest in that commercial sense in which the syndicated owners and the federated workmen are vested interests .

		They are , at the same time , numerically and by habitual outlook , no such heterogeneous and un - wieldy body as the federated workmen , whose num - bers and scattering interest has left all their en - deavors substantially nugatory .

		In short , the en - gineers are in a position to make the next move .

		By comparison with the population at large , in - cluding the financial powers and the kept classes , the technological specialists which come in question here are a very inconsiderable rfumber ; yet this small number is indispensable to the continued work - ing of the productive industries .

		So slight are their numbers , and so sharply defined and homogeneous is their class , that a sufficiently compact and in - clusive organization of their forces should arrange itself almost as a matter of course , so soon as any appreciable proportion of them shall be moved by any common purpose .

		And the common purpose is not far to seek , in the all-pervading industrial confusion , obstruction , waste , and retardation which business as usual continually throws in their face .

		At the same time they are the leaders of the industrial personnel , the workmen , the officers of the line and the rank and file ; and these are coming into a frame of mind to follow their leaders in any adventure that holds a promise of advancing the common good .

		To those men , soberly trained in a spirit of tang - ible performance and endowed with something more than an even share of the sense of workmanship , and ` endowed also with the common heritage of partiality for the rule of Live and Let Live , the disallowance of an outworn and obstructive right of absentee ownership is not likely to seem a shocking infraction of the sacred realities .

		That customary right of ownership by virtue of which the vested interests continue to control the industrial system 6o6 THE DIAL
June 14	DATE	for the benefit of the kept classes , belongs to an older order of things than the mechanical industry .

		It has come out of a past that was made up of small things and traditional make-believe .

		For all the purposes of that scheme of tangible performance that goes to make up the technologist 's world , it is without form and void .

		So that , given time for due irritation , it should by no means come as a sur - prise if the guild of engineers are provoked to put their heads together and , quite out of hand , dis - allow that large ownership that goes to make the vested interests and unmake the industrial system .

		And there stand behind them the massed and rough - hanrded legions of the industrial rank and file , ill at ease and looking for new things .

		The older com - mercialized generation among them would , of course , ask themselves : Why should we worry ?

		What do we stand to gain ?

		But the younger gen - eration , not so hard-bitten by commercial experience , will be quite as likely to ask themselves : What do we stand to lose ?

		And there is the patent fact that such a thing as a general strike of the techno - logical specialists in industry need involve no more than a minute fraction of one per cent of the popu - lation ; yet it would swiftly bring a collapse of the old order and sweep the timeworn fabric of finance and sabotage into the discard for good and all .

		Such a catastrophe would doubtless be deplorable .

		It would look something like the end pf the world to all those persons who take their stand with the kept classes , but it may come to seem no more than an incident of the day 's work to the engineers and to the rough-handed legions of the rank and file .

		It is a situation which may well be deplored .

		But there is no gain in losing patience with a conjunction of circumstances .

		And it can do no harm to take stock of the situation and recognize that , by force of circumstance , it is now open to the
Council of Technological Workers	ORGANIZATION	' and Soldiers ' Deputies to make the next move , in their own way and in their own good time .

		When and what this move will be , if any , or even what it will be like , is not some - thing on which a layman can hold a confident opinion .

		But so much seems clear , that the in - dustrial dictatorship of the captain of finance is now held on sufferance of the engineers and is liable at any time to be discontinued at their discretion as a matter of convenience .

		THE DIAL
ROBERT MORSS LOVETT	PERSON	, Editor In Charge of the Reconstruction Program :
JOHN DEWEY THORSTEIN VEBLEN CLARENCE BRITTEN HELEN MAROT	PERSON	THE TREATY WITH
AUSTRIA	LOCATION	IN INCOMPLETE form is now before the American people .

		So far as may be judged it approaches more nearly the
Brest	LOCATION	- Litovsk model than the Treaty with
Germany	LOCATION	.

		The duty of liberals in the Allied countries toward it is therefore even clearer than toward the German Treaty .

		It is the duty which rested upon every German and Austrian liberal in regard to the peace of Brest-Litovsk , and which some of them fulfilled .

		It is to repudiate both compacts utterly , and allow them to be ratified , if it must be , only under pro- test .

		No other course of action has any moral sanc - tion .

		As to its practical value , it is to be noted that already , under vigorous and forthright criticism of liberal journals , the Allied nations are disposed to make the German reply a basis for modification of terms in other words to substitute a negotiated for a dictated peace .

		THE TREATIES WITH
GERMANY	LOCATION	AND
AUSTRIA	LOCATION	are a clear proof that , however much the Allies may want a
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	, they want other things more .

		Indeed ,
France	LOCATION	,
Japan	LOCATION	, and
Italy	LOCATION	, the three predatory members of the
Alliance	ORGANIZATION	, from the first regarded the League as a menace to their aggressive policies and made their acquiescence a matter of pur - chase at a ruinous price .

		England wishes a League only as a validation of her empire , is unwilling to sacrifice any of her possessive rights , and is under suspicion of seeking to use the mandatory system for imperialistic ends .

		The
United States	LOCATION	wants the League , but is unwilling to sacrifice to it her posi - tion in the
Western Hemisphere	LOCATION	.

		Even with these reservations it might still be possible to launch the League by virtue of the measure of hope and good will that remains in the neutral and defeated na - tions , including
China	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	, but by the Treaties this last hope is frustrated .

		The victors will not yield any of the attributes of a '' strong peace '' to secure the League .

		On the part of the first four partners this attitude is so bound up with territorial and financial claims as to be readily un - derstood , but on the part of the
United States	LOCATION	it is explicable only in terms of national hypocrisy and stupidity .

		No one believes that Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	would have sacrificed the essential features of his new world order to the humiliation and spoliation of
Germany	LOCATION	if he had not realized that the country behind him demanded such humiliation and spoliation .

		And to what end ?

		Certain interests in this country may profit by the ruin of German in - dustry , but the business of the
United States	LOCATION	as a whole can only suffer .

		We have no legitimate re - venge to seek from
Germany	LOCATION	, no great injury , mate - rial or moral , to make even .

		We have inflicted vastly more harm on
Germany	LOCATION	than we have re - ceived .

		Our attitude is to be explained solely by a survival of war psychology .

		We are still stupid and blind from hate , and unfortunately that hate has extended itself to
Russia	LOCATION	.

		The Armistice balked us of what we regarded as legitimate prey the destruction of German cities and the massacre of Germans on German soil and in these circum - stances we have found an outlet for our feeling in our former ally .

		Thus we have made it impossible to use the forces that are sincerely interested in a new international order , and we are compelled to resort to the doubtful process of wishing such an order on our suspicious and half-unwilling asso - ciates .

		In other words the
United States	LOCATION	is de - termined to sacrifice the one tangible object for which it fought , not to material advantage or to calculated revenge , but to a state of mind .

		And for that state of mind , which blocks his own en - deavors , Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	is largely responsible .

		He is reaping the fruit of his panic-stricken war policy .

		When he suspended free speech and trampled upon opinion , when he gave the country over to the mob law of security leagues and defense societies , when he sold his bonds on atrocity stories and set up a department of public falsehood by way of prop - aganda , he was preparing exactly such a situation as he will confront on his return a country which will not renounce any of the fruits of victory which others are gathering , which will not make place for
Germany	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	in the new order of the world , because it is still '' in no condition to do business . ''

		PRESIDENT
WILSON	PERSON	'S RECENT SPEECHES IN
PARIS	LOCATION	will do little for his own credit , the service of his country , or the honor of her dead .

		On
May 10	DATE	he delivered an address before the
French Academy of Moral and Political Sciences	ORGANIZATION	in which he delivered himself of his usual well-laundered sentiments : My view of the
State	ORGANIZATION	is that it must stop and listen to 6o8 THE DIAL
June 14	DATE	what I have to saj no matter how humble I am .

		... I have always been among those who believe that the great - est freedom or speech was the greatest safety .

		... In this free air of free speech men get into that sort of com - munication with another which constitutes the basis of all common achievement .

		One pauses aghast at this oily hypocrisy .

		Mr.
Wil	PERSON	- son knows that there are hundreds of his fellow - citizens in prison for speaking their minds , not to the
State	ORGANIZATION	but to spies set by
the State	ORGANIZATION	to trap them .

		He knows it because he has just commuted the sen - tence of .

		such a fellow-citizen
William Powell	PERSON	, of
Lansing	LOCATION	,
Michigan	LOCATION	from twenty years to one as punishment for saying in private that the stories of German atrocities were propaganda , that he could not believe in President
Wilson	PERSON	, that the war was a rich man 's war .

		One year of confinement in
Leavenworth	LOCATION	, which , with the unearned increment of tuberculosis , means death , and
$ 5,000	MONEY	fine which has already reduced this man 's family to beggary !

		This is President
Wilson	PERSON	's conception of free speech .

		We submit that he has made the French Academy of Political and Moral Sciences the victim of a hoax which would be silly if it were not tragic .

		Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's
Memorial Day Address	ORGANIZATION	is likewise notable for establishing a complete antithesis be - tween words and deeds .

		It has the same fulsome quality as the address to the Academy , the same hollow rhetoric but here tragically misplaced . ''

		It is delightful ... It is more delightful . ''

		The world cares little for the stages of Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's hedonism .

		It cares even less for the tawdry second-hand verbal ornament of one who cherishes the platitude as a figure of speech .

		But when he makes the death of his soldiers an argu - ment for the cause which he has betrayed , the mind of the reader is divided between amazement at the effrontery and horror at the sacrilege . ''

		Shall 1 ever speak a word of counsel which is inconsistent with the assurances I gave ` them when they came over ? ''

		This is quoted from his address at
New York	LOCATION	before his second departure for
France	LOCATION	.

		Then it was a promise ; now it is a broken promise . ''

		Here I stand consecrated in the spirit of the men who were once my comrades and who are now gone and who left me under eternal bonds of fidel - ity . ''

		One is forced to ask : Where does Mr.
Wil	PERSON	- son stand ?

		Perhaps at
Fiume	ORGANIZATION	.

		What are those eternal bonds ?

		The recognition of the British pro- tectorate in
Egypt	LOCATION	, the cession of the
Saar Valley	ORGANIZATION	to
France	LOCATION	, of
South Tyrol	LOCATION	to
Italy	LOCATION	, of Shantung to
Japan	LOCATION	, the starvation of
Russia	LOCATION	, the economic war after the war against
Germany	LOCATION	.

		It is too much to expect that he should characterize these achieve - ments in truthful language .

		He has properly left that to Mr.
Debs	PERSON	.

		It is perhaps too much to ex - pect that he should refrain from exalting himself in the light of what he would like to have done in place of these things .

		But that he should accept them in the name of the ' men who at his bidding died for a better world is blasphemy .

		I HE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR , IN CON - vention at
Atlantic City	LOCATION	, is pondering no less a problem than the future of the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		Is indus - trial democracy , so warmly and vaguely recom - mended by President
Wilson	PERSON	, to come as the gift of a government of politically federated geographic areas , controlled by a labor vote , or will this democ - racy be first arrived at within self-controlled pro- duction units , destined finally themselves to achieve federation and to replace the whole geographic-rep - resentative system ?

		If Federated labor and alt labor is to make an intelligent choice between eco - nomic and political means , such a selection must be conditioned by a choice between a future built from the bottom , and one that hangs from the top .

		With all due deference to the
A. F. L.	PERSON	's deliberations as to the advisability of its participation in a Labor party , it may be said that labor has already made its choice of means and ends .

		It is not necessary to call on
Russia	LOCATION	for proof .

		Great
Britain	LOCATION	will serve ; the
December	DATE	elections found British labor not im - potent but politically indifferent ; by the extension of the shop-steward movement , and by the initiation of strikes in sharp succession , British labor has work a near-dictatorship and has even succeeded in sweep - ing into its control a group hitherto subservient to - reactionary control the police .

		In
Spain	LOCATION	the Con - federacion
General del Trabajo	ORGANIZATION	devotes itself not to the manipulation of political machinery but to the sabotage of government .

		Canadian authorities find themselves practically powerless before a laboi movement which embraces not only the employees of .

		private industry but an army of the servants of thu
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		And the
United States	LOCATION	itself offers shan .

		enough contrasts between indifferent and ineffective : voting and earnest and powerful direct action .

		The - War was not the sole author of today 's distrust of , the political State ; perhaps the Peace has done even more to alienate the people from the political or - ganisms which are supposed to represent them .

		If the War brought the breakdown of bureaucracy , the Peace has done as great a disservice to the re - ligion of nationalism .

		The
State	ORGANIZATION	has been proved both impotent and morally irresponsible .

		The ten - dency of the time is toward decentralization and a. .

		new beginning .

		Neither
State Socialism nor State Capitalism	ORGANIZATION	, with their common dependence on geographic-political machinery , can be accommodated to a new era that promises , not to bring men to - gether in horizontal layers that cut straight across every economic relationship , but to unite them in vertical self-governing units as their work unites , them in the factory in the day time , rather than in the club or on the street corner at night .

		Direct action is a tremendous protest against the existence of a system of artificial relationships and political indirection , and a demand for the recognition of production groups economic successors to the family as the natural elements of a so - ciety devoted to the achievement of industrial democracy .

		THE DIAL 609 - LANEM ET CIRCENSES WAS THE FORMULA FOR THE politicians of
Imperial Rome	ORGANIZATION	, on which they relied to keep the underlying population from imagining vain remedies for their own hard case .

		Mutatis mutandis , in the vernacular of the twentieth cen - tury , this would be as much as to say , '' The Bread Line and the Movies . ''

		This is not a literal transla - tion of the Latin motto .

		It amounts to an equivalence of practice rather than an equivalence of words panis , of course , is Latin for '' bread '' rather than '' the bread line '' ; and the nearest mod - ern equivalent for circenses would perhaps be '' the ballfield '' rather than '' the movies . ''

		But then , as the Romans would say , tempora mutantur .

		Panis , of course signifies '' bread '' a product of the baker 's art , rather than the breadline , which is a product of the associated charities .

		But in effect , as it comes into this Imperial Roman motto , panem signified that certain salutary minimum of bread without which the underlying population could not be counted on to tolerate the continued rule of the Imperial politicians and of those vested interests that were entrusted to the care of the politicians .

		So it appears that the politicians of Imperial
Rome	LOCATION	allowed the underlying population a ration of act - ual bread , at some cost to the vested interests .

		It appears that the astute politicians of Imperial
Rome	LOCATION	dared go no nearer to the modern democratic in - stitution of the bread line .

		To those democratic statesmen who now bear up the banners of the vested interests also called the standards of Law and Order this prodigal conduct of the Roman politicians will perhaps seem weak and little-minded .

		But something is to be allowed in extenuation of their pusillanimity .

		The politicians of Imperial
Rome	LOCATION	had not the use of liberty loans and machine guns ; and then the underlying population of that cruder age was perhaps less patient and reasonable , less given to promises and procrastination .

		Tem - pora mutantur .

		The democratic statesmen of the twentieth century are more fortunate in both re - spects .

		More particularly , the mechanical ap - pliances for preserving law and order have been greatly perfected ; and by suitable fiscal methods the underlying population which is to be '' kept in hand '' can be induced to pay for these mechanical appliances by which they are to be kept in hand .

		So the statesmen of the twentieth century are en - abled to let the bread line serve in place of the bread , and thereby to save the net output of the Republic 's industry more nearly intact for the use of the kept classes .

		But in the matter of circenses , too , there has been change and improvement during these inter - vening centuries since the Glory that was
Rome	LOCATION	.

		Political practice runs on a more economical plan in this businesslike age .

		The Roman circenses ap - pear to have cut somewhat wastefully into the ordi - nary '' earnings '' of those vested interests for whose benefit the Roman Imperium was administered ; whereas the movies of the twentieth century are a business proposition in their own right , a source of '' earnings '' and a vested interest .

		And in ordi - nary times of peace or war the movies supply what appears to be required in the way of politically salutary dissipation .

		Yet in time of stress , as is now evident , something more enticing may be required to distract popular attention securely and keep the underlying population from taking stock of the statemen 's promises and performance .

		At a critical juncture , when large chances of profit and loss for the vested interests are in the balance , it may be well to take thought and add something to the workday routine of the movies , even at some ex - pense .

		In case of urgent need , to stabilise a doubt - fully manageable popular sentiment , the rant and swagger of many subsidised heroes and the pomp and circumstance and moving show incident to a victory loan should have a salutary use of the same kind ; expensive , no doubt , but then the cost need not be borne by those vested interests that are to be safeguarded from the corrosive afterthought of the underlying population .

		And then there are avail - able such heroic spectacles as a '' victory fleet , '' to - gether with parades , arches , and banners , miles of banners and square miles of heroic printed matter ; costly , no doubt , but also doubtless salutary .

		So also , in - case of need there is something to be made of such a thing as an overseas flight ; particularly if it be abundantly staged and somewhat more than abundantly advertised .

		It is a potent resource , capable of lifting the common man 's afterthought in - to the upper air , instead of letting it run along the ground of material fact , where it might do mischief ; costly , no doubt , but then the cost need not be counted so closely , since it is the common man who pays the cost , the same common man who is forever in danger of getting into mischief by reflecting unduly on what the statesmen have been using him for .

		And , of course , since it is the com - mon man who is to be relieved of afterthought , it is only reasonable that the common man should pay the cost .

WALTER C. HUNTER	PERSON	.

		II SIR : A good many of us Americans have supposed that the operation of the Draft and Espionage Acts insofar as they imprisoned men and women for hold - ing or expressing views contrary to those of the gov - ernment must be repulsive to President
Wilson	PERSON	's sense of fair play and common decency .

		We felt that although he championed the Draft Act , and sanc - tioned the Espionage Act , he did so only from the conviction of war necessity ; and we expected him to come out of the war preserving at least - the modicum of democratic feeling which would lead him at once to redress , insofar as lay in his power , the wrongs committed under the operation of these measures .

		The Armistice came , and we watched and waited .

		We have ' been watching and waiting for very nearly seven months , and not a single decent word or act has come from the
Administration	ORGANIZATION	in regard to the fifteen hundred men and women who have been cast into prison for holding independent opinions in a country which our newspapers and our school-books tell us is a democracy .

		Instead of an immediate and general amnesty which would have in a degree cleaned the soiled skirts of the government we have witnessed a fraudulent play in which batches of fifty political prisoners have from time to time been released or had their sentences reduced in varying measure .

		Behold our generous government in the role of merciful dispenser of pardons !

		This is no amnesty ; it is the veriest pretense .

		Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	has been more interested in telling
Europe	LOCATION	why he is a democrat and why the rest of the world should imitate the sterling example he sets , than he has been in bringing about a little house-cleaning in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Is it any wonder that the Entente diplomats did not take his fourteen points seriously when they saw how little his professions squared with his practice ?

		Of course , Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	may not have wanted them to take his points seriously but that is a different matter .

		We have in the continued holding of almost all of the political prisoners a liv - ing proof of Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's innate casuistry and ca - pacity for insincere and hypocritical action .

		The President 's conception of democracy is at best flimsy and shallow , for it takes no account of the economic reorganization which must come before any real de - mocracy can exist , but even the idea of democracy which he vaunts and claims himself the spokesman of is being fundamentally violated .

		So long as he holds these men and women in prison , so long must we consider him actively insincere .

P. COFFMAN	PERSON	.

		Ill SIR : The writer , like thousands of others , tries to have respect for the press of the country .

		He feels that the editor is , at least in a way , a representative of public opinion and principles .

		Yet , if you will just fairly and impartially think it over , you will bear me out when I state that just as independent men in religion are leaving churches , so are people in a political sense losing respect for newspapers and politicians .

		The writer has twice volunteered in defense of his country , and this last time he deemed it his duty to do his part , small though it was , to end the military jag of the now William the Con - quered .

		Much is written in our reactionary press about spies and alien enemies being responsible for the discontent .

		This is only partly true .

		Thousands of patriotic people , including soldiers and sailors , are registering kicks .

		And another thing : who is to blame for these spies being here ?

		I an - swer advisedly ; I was connected with the '' Aid for Information , ''
Navy Department	ORGANIZATION	, which , strip - ped of all language , simply means a detective , and was stationed at
New Orleans	LOCATION	.

		Six of us were thus detailed .

		We were informed that we were to act as detectives to detect enemies and draft evaders .

		Very little time was devoted to this ; in - stead , we were used to coddle and hound soldiers and sailors , to watch their every move .

		A few of us could not stand these contemptible proceedings and asked to be sent back to the
Naval Station	ORGANIZATION	, but this So-called
American Protective League	ORGANIZATION	, better known among us as the
American Pimp League	ORGANIZATION	, continued these childish tactics until the writer , violating military ethics , at the request of comrades and their sisters and wives who had been insulted , forwarded a sixteen-page memorial to the President of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		This never came out in the
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 611 press .

		People who have the proper conception of freedom of speech also desire to see that blessed privilege restored .

		F.
WALLACE	PERSON	.

		ROADS TO FREEDOM SIR : There is much in Mr.
Durant	PERSON	's critique of Mr.
Bertrand Russell	PERSON	's '' Roads to Freedom '' with which I should like to take issue .

		His view is so hasty that it fails to grasp the meaning of some of Mr.
Russell	PERSON	's most careful arguments .

		Take this passage , for instance : He approaches the social question always from the point of view of the artist , and tests each plan by asking `` What will it do to art ? ''

		... there will be a minimum wage for all , even for those who will not work ; the creative impulse , the constructive disposition , may be trusted to keep all but a few men busy ... But Mr.
Bertrand Russel	PERSON	approaches no question from the point of view of the artist ; his point of view is that of a philosopher , ' and it is so broad that it would be futile to try to isolate it as a personal or even typical stand .

		As a philosopher he is , to , be sure , Concerned with the significance of the creative in human experience , which he admits is given to but a few .

		His argument is that a minimum wage , sufficient to meet the bare necessities of life , should be given to all , regardless of whether or not they work .

		But what man among us is satisfied with the bare necessities of life ?

		Only the elite , those who do not live by bread alone , will not be only too willing to work for their share of the luxuries .

		In this little book no differentiation is made ` be - tween the necessities and the luxuries ; but it is not the function of a philosopher to draw the line ex - ceedingly nice between values that would vary in every locality .

		Contrary to Mr.
Durant	PERSON	's asser - tion , '' the powerful competitive impulses of men , '' as well as the evil tendencies in human nature gener - ally , are carefully presented and examined in this work in such measure as they influence the prob - lems considered .

		Indeed , says Mr.
Durant	PERSON	, if one may add a word of criticism , the impression left by the book is one of over - simplicity and unreality ; it has about it an air of jejune and ideologic youth .

		It has all of
Kropotkin	PERSON	's gentleness and many of his delusions ; but it has little of
Kropotkin	PERSON	's patient grappling with difficult details .

		It has beauty , such as one has come to expect from
Bertrand Russell	PERSON	; but it is a fragile beauty ; a sentence or two from
Nietzsche	LOCATION	, one fears , would smash it into sweet regrets .

		There is nothing of the fragile in Mr.
Bertrand Russell	PERSON	; his work will weather the Nietzschean bombast , as his spirit and truth will weather per - secution .

		Perhaps that is why
England	LOCATION	fears him , as
Germany	LOCATION	never feared
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	.

		He is as dangerous as Jesus in the temple , as
Socrates	LOCATION	in the market place .

		In a world and a civilization that pursue facts to the exclusion of truth and idea , Roads to Freedom will doubtless seem to many unreal and simple .

		Our German philological methods have reached a stage where a man who sets out to organize facts and ideas instead of merely compiling them is regarded with suspicion .

		His efforts are called youthful by incompetent critics who are in the habit of applying that adjective to what they do not begin to understand .

		The same may be said of the charge of simplicity .

		If '' oversimplicity '' means anything , it means pseudo-simplicity , the characteristic of the monistic mind briefly the habit of judging every problem , in all its aspects , in terms of one substance , one principle , or one categorical imperative .

		To accuse Mr.
Russell	PERSON	of this is to fail to grasp the meaning and application of neo-realism .

		It has none of
Kropotkin	PERSON	's '' grappling with difficult details , '' because it has , in fact , nothing to do with details .

		It deals , on the contrary , with ideas , theories , attitudes of mind .

		It rests upon the mature wisdom of a profound and difficult meta - physic , the result of a life-long study , a philosophy which has not as yet been successfully refuted .

		The attitudes of mind with which it deals are the real roads to freedom , and they are not '' goals '' as Mr.
Durant	PERSON	supposes , as well as the American publisher who gives it the misnomer , `` Proposed Roads to Freedom . ''

		For the nature of freedom is such that those who seek it can not race toward it and seize it ; the concept , in this case , must precede its realization .

		INTER ARMA SILET LABOR SIR : In his recent communication
John J. McSwain	PERSON	, Captain of Infantry , proposes an advisory commission to study and advise

		I am not questioning the advisability of military training or otherwise but I wish to point out that among all the professions and occupations he suggests for per - sonnel there is not the slightest suggestion that labor might desire to be represented on such a commis - sion .

June 14	DATE	Notes on New Books WAR AND REVOLUTION IN
RUSSIA	LOCATION	,
1914	DATE	-
1917	DATE	.

		By
General Basil Gourkb	ORGANIZATION	.

		420 pages .


Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	.

		The author of this latest book about
Russia	LOCATION	possesses all the distinction that adheres to obsolete titles .

		He was chief of the Russian Imperial Gen - eral Staff from
November , 1916	DATE	to
March , 1917	DATE	, and he was commander-in-chief of the western armies from
March to June	DATE	of the latter year , un - til he was relieved of his post by the Kerensky gov - ernment .

		That he is alive today and able to write his memoirs at
Paris	LOCATION	is due to the happy animosity of the first revolutionary government , which did him the favor of sending him into exile .

		He writes an account of
Russia	LOCATION	's participation in the war , from the stages of mobilization onward , with the author - ity of one who was at all times among the high command ; and if one may judge by his openly avowed attitude toward the first revolution , he writes with a singular freedom from the desire to please .

		No mere courtier would ever at this late stage of the world 's progress admit that he advised the provisional government that the revolution should be stalled for the duration of the war , and that he urged them naively '' not to forget that the man who can not satisfy his elementary material necessities does not require liberty . ''

		In deciding between the continuance of the war and the welfare of
Russia Gourko	LOCATION	was at one with the politicians of the western democracies in urging that the benefits of internal reorganization be sacrificed .

		But he was honest enough to see that there was a clear-cut alter - native .

		If this had been perceived by the western democracies , the road to the present chaos would not have been paved with so many futile gestures of benevolence .

		BOLSHEVISM .

		By
John Spargo	PERSON	.

		389 pages .


Harper	PERSON	.

		The latest dissertation of
John Spargo	PERSON	has a pair of antipodal appeals .

		For the unsuspecting popular reader it presents a simple undramatic and substantiated history of the Socialist movement in
Russia	LOCATION	, from the underground agitation of
Herzen	ORGANIZATION	and his disciples to the debacle before the hosts of Bolshevism .

		On the other hand , it is excellent propaganda for the Russian Social-Revolutionary party , which is , it can be guessed , the legitimatized Socialist faction , being closely affiliated with the In - ternational
Bureau	ORGANIZATION	.

		Naturally , it has
Spargo	PERSON	's sup - port ; to it is consecrated , he believes , the eventual democratization of
Russia	LOCATION	.

		Although now being Bolsheviciously persecuted , it was the group behind the
Constituent Assembly	ORGANIZATION	, and in that body is
Russia	LOCATION	's hope of recovery from chaos .

		Spargo an - nounces that he takes no stock in any of the material presented by anti-Bolshevist campaigning , neither journalistic horror headlines nor the
Sisson	PERSON	docu - ments ; nevertheless his book is a passionate effort to destroy faith in every phase of Communist thought or activity .

		Surely the Communist pro- gramme , though dangerous and doomed sooner or still sooner for the political ash-heap , can not , judg - ing from its rapid spread , be utterly rotten and destructive .


Spargo	PERSON	does not think so : '' The Bol - shevist , wherever he may present himself , is the foe of progress and the ally of reaction . ''

		And so his case , since the evidence is preponderantly from Rus - sian Socialist -LRB- not Bolshevist -RRB- sources , obviously seems biassed in favor of such more sober democrats as the Social-Revolutionists .

		With the radicals publishing propaganda for Bolshevism , and the So - cialists clamoring for justice to the International programme , only a few voices raised in defense of the bourgeoisie are lacking to complete the Russian babel .

		Although Mr.
Spargo	PERSON	's book is a valuable aid to an understanding of the politico-economic struggle in
Russia	LOCATION	and the dangers of Bolshevism , it would be more trustworthy if it were less right - eously Socialistic .

		600 pages ; 2 vols .

		Lane .

		This collection of
Swinburne	ORGANIZATION	's letters , wrongly described in the introduction as the first , is dis - appointing to those who will turn to it for a revela - tion of his personality .

		It is a comment on Swin - burne 's interests rather than on himself .

		It ap - pears that Messrs.
Gosse	PERSON	and Wise have had access only to the poet 's correspondence with friends who like themselves were of the stiff , academic sort be - fore whom he felt bound to conduct himself with elegance and discretion , to whom he was bound by common interests in scholarship and esthetics .

		These interests , it should be added , counted for more with
Swinburne	PERSON	than with any poet of equal fame .

		In none does personal experience furnish so little inspiration and material for poetry ; in none does literature and the history of literature give so much .

		Greek tragedy , the Latin decadence , Medi - eval romance and lyric , Renaissance and especially Elizabethan drama , French Romanticism he satu - rated himself in all periods and practiced a multi - tude of forms .

		His heroes were literary heroes
Marlowe	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	,
Landor	ORGANIZATION	,
Victor Hugo	PERSON	,
Mall	PERSON	- arme ,
Baudelaire	LOCATION	.

		Of these literary interests and idolatries the present volumes are a record .

		One pursuit in which
Swinburne	PERSON	succeeded the romantic critics of the preceding generation was the recovery and attribution of Elizabethan poems and plays , and with this subject more than half his letters are concerned .

		The letters which come closest to hav - ing personal value are those which bear evidence of the gusto with which he wrote , and read , and re - called poetry . ''

		^ THE CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTOR .

		By
Major Walter Guest Kellogg	ORGANIZATION	.

		141 pages .


Boni	PERSON	and
Liveright	PERSON	.

		Major Kellogg represented the army on the com - mission of which Judge
Mack	PERSON	and Dean Stone were members .

		He has a military mind ; the confusion , repetition , and mistaken emphasis of his book show that .

		He is haunted by what he can not under - stand and he returns to it again and again .

		One of these things is conscience .

		The cases of men like Mennonites and Molokans , who are constrained by the external law of a sect to avoid bearing arms or wearing buttons , he can understand or at least classify .

		The absolutist and the political objector are beyond him .

		As for emphasis ,
Major Kellogg	ORGANIZATION	is much impressed by his own wisdom and good will in permitting objectors to appear before his court without standing at attention and saluting .

		He has great sympathy with officers assigned to the charge of conscientious objectors and thus deprived of the opportunity for active service in
France	LOCATION	: '' It is not surprising that in a certain few cases the patience of the officer was so exhausted by the maliciously annoying attitude of various objectors in his charge that he lost his temper and maltreated them . ''

		He adds that '' the Secretary of War , in one or two instances , ordered investigations and took disciplinary action against those responsible . ''

		He does not say that the disciplinary action resulted in the honorable dismissal of the officers .

		Major Kellogg never visited a disciplinary barracks , but is under the impression from hearsay that the ob - jectors were fairly treated .

		He must have known of the way in which the
Hofer	PERSON	brothers were tortured to death in the
Federal Disciplinary Barracks	ORGANIZATION	at
Alcatraz Island	LOCATION	, but he does not men - tion it .

		On the whole , if we needed evidence of the ineptitude of the War Department in dealing with conscientious objectors , and of its ostrich-like belief in the virtue of concealment , we should find it in Major Kellogg 's uncomprehending observations , and in Secretary
Baker	PERSON	's perfunctory introduction .

South of France	LOCATION	, cresting a great rock half circled by the

		To this Palace of
Avignon	LOCATION	the French kings brought the Popes of
Rome	LOCATION	for the period of their
Babylonish Captivity	ORGANIZATION	.

		To the out - side world the Palace presented huge defenses com - parable in strength to the cliff itself , while the deep walls of the courtyard were pierced with Gothic windows giving upon chapels with high groined ceilings , and great rooms rich with the colors of Renaissance art ... The Popes passed , and finally the kings .

		Enemies of the new Republic crowded the frontiers ;
France	LOCATION	became for a quarter of a century an armed camp , and to the Palace of the Popes came '' military servitude and grandeur . ''

		Gothic windows were bricked up ; beams to support new barracks floors were driven into chapel walls , one tier above another ; pictured saints were alto - gether blotted out beneath alternate layers of smoke and whitewash .


France	LOCATION	had found a new religion .

		To '' the wholly active life of the soldier '' of that day Alfred de Vigny brought '' an entirely con - templative nature . ''

		As a child he '' saw in the Nobility one great family of hereditary soldiers '' and '' thought only of growing to a soldier 's size . ''

		Through his father he knew intimately
Louis	PERSON	XIV and Frederic the Great .

		Toward the end of the Empire he was '' a heedless school boy ... ceaselessly dizzied by the guns and the bells of the Te Deum . '' ''

		Then more than ever , '' he says , '' a truly ungovernable love for the glory of arms took hold of me ; a passion all the more unfortunate be - cause it was the exact time when ...
France	LOCATION	began to be cured of it . ''

		Each year of the Restora - tion opened with the hope of a new war and closed in peace , leaving De Vigny long inactive '' between the echoes and the dreams of battles , '' learning from the dead routine of garrison life and the stories of old soldiers '' what there is that endears in the savage life of arms . ''

		... Looking from nearby at the life of ... armed troops , it will be truly seen that the soldier 's existence is the saddest relic of barbarism subsisting among mankind .

		I have said so and I believe it is , next to capital punishment !

		But it will be seen also that nothing is more worthy of the interest and the love of

		284 pages .

		The color-note of Fields of the Fatherless is a lifeless gray .

		Accompanied by a monotony of short sentences and insignificant details , the author tells of her dreary existence as an illegitimate child , bar - maid , factory hand , and domestic servant in Scot - land the tragedy of the soul yearning for wider horizons than those that imprison it .

		The book is not , however , exciting enough to interest , passionate enough to move , or introspective enough to .

		Tumblefold , sketches of boy life in English slums , also falls short .

		As it is , he achieves several excellent stories for juvenile consumption and one , The Woman Who Lagged Behind , of genuine merit for adults .

		The strange thing about both books is the complete absence of revolutionary protest in them .

		Their authors apparently console themselves with thoughts of a beneficent God and the scanty joys of the poor ; they seem to have abso - lutely no touch with present-day social movements .

		AN INTRODUCTION TO THE GOVERNMENT OF MODERN STATES .

		By
W. F. Willoughby	PERSON	.

		455 pages .

		Century .

		Many students of political science have been turned from a thorough inquiry into this important department of education by the intricacies of sup - posedly elementary textbooks .

		To meet the lack of adequate yet simple introductory books , Professor
W. F. Willoughby	PERSON	has written a clear exposition of the government of modern states .

		In method , the author has departed from the usual custom of weav - ing a description of political principles with pages of explanatory matter , citations of cases , and other details which the student of '' Gov. i , '' looks upon with awe and resignation .

		He has limited himself to a study of principles , and has pointed out with admirable clarity the many nice distinctions in gov - ernment political organization which account .

		for the many differences in procedure obtaining in vari - ous states .

		Besides elucidating principles by show - ing their applications to typical states , he has em - phasized the fitness of particular political organiza - tions to the temper and the development of differ - ent peoples .

		The shortcomings of our own political organiza - tion enforce recognition when we are brought face to face with the administrative and legislative dif - ficulties which confront us in any attempt to accede to a demand for more democratic control of govern - ment .

		The inflexibility of the Constitution , the possibility of an amendment 's being passed which may not reflect the wishes of the electorate , the over - lapping of the administrative functioning organs of government , the duplication of organization because of our multiple system , and our unscientific method of budget-making are but a few of the questions which Professor
Willoughby	PERSON	presents .

		In addition , an excellent index refers to every detail of political organization discussed in the text .

		In short , The Government of Modern States is both an enticing introduction to the study of political science , and a quick reference work for those whose understand - ing of political principles has become a little hazy .

		THE PRESENT CONFLICT OF IDEALS .

Green	ORGANIZATION	.

		Aviation is the image which Professor
Perry	PERSON	's swift-winged survey of the world of modern thought naturally suggests .

		He moves with insouciant ease through the pure ethers of reflection and charts the orbis terrarum animae with the nice precision of a metaphysical expert .

		The result is well , a some - what impressionistic photography .

		The latitudes of competing philosophies and the longitudes of con - tending national ideals are all duly observed and noted , but in the final representation laboriously hewn .

		paths are apt to appear as erratic streaks : storied edifices sit squat upon the ground , while the serrated fortifications blur and lose their teeth .

		But for all this , the chart is a good guide , and a timely .

		We have come to an hour of appraisal in things of the mind no less than in affairs of the forum and the mart and it is good to have before us a book which can give a broad report of the mind 's labors in the decades which have so lately been sealed into the dead past .

		To be sure , in this hour , a man is like to have the feeling that he is walking in a land of ghosts ghosts that ought to be decently laid by now when he finds himself once more quarreling with Absolutist quiddities or gasping amid Realistic rarefactions : but , in fair - ness to
Perry	LOCATION	, he has given as little of this as need be , and has centered his effort upon the humaner and more living elements in the philosophies of the generation .

		6i8 THE DIAL
June 14	DATE	but the map of the human mind will be changed ; and it is a wholly sensible effort at construction to prepare for this certain change into the new by a square and comprehensive regard of the old .

		For making this possible in a readable , suggestive , and quite manfully up-to-date volume , Professor
Perry	PERSON	deserves all good will , and his book bon voyage .

		But one really must say a word more .

		Professor
Perry	PERSON	takes us up into a high place and shows us all the philosophical dominions spread out below including his own .

		That is the odd thing about it : he has apparently learned to fly , but has not suc - ceeded in detaching himself ; and when we examine our vehicle a little closer we discover that we are borne aloft , not in an aeroplane , but in a kite se - curely tethered to the New Realism .

		What this may mean , in full effect , must be left to the read - er 's discovery .

		It is not merely that there is , on the author 's part , a bias in favor of his own convictions : that surely is a virtue , if convictions mean anything .

		But it is the nature of these convictions that some - how forbids genuine flight .

		Neo-Realism calls it - self rationalism , intellectualism , and prides itself upon being passionless and devoid of intuition .

		By that very count it is void of the power to move men , void of life , empty of help .

		Perry skims the surface of modern thought ; his own school is but an eddy in the moil ; there is no depth , no current , no drive .

		Doubtless , philosophy is so accepted and so intended by the New Realists ; but the result is that this display of the varieties of thought leads but to a general impression of the footlessness and haplessness of all intellectual labor , to a kind of suicide of the Realistic premise .

		And it gives , too , to the expositor , not even the power which should be legitimately his , as guide and prophet .

		He moves familiarly and discursively through the field of con - temporary thought , but for all his cultivation he makes no plant grow therein ; indeed one might add that he is singularly adept in destroying the dynamogeny of the authors he treats whose philo - sophical convictions are rather more living than those of the Realists .

		Self-conscious intellectualism , dissected out of organic life , always has been -LRB- and how can it ever be anything else ? -RRB-

		a condition of moral paralysis .

		It is no fault of Professor
Perry	PERSON	's agreeable exposition that his book leaves the reader unperturbed , uninspired ; rather it is the miasma of his philosophy , which , like a dead thing , draws him back into the company of the ghosts .

		CHIMNEY-POT PAPERS .

		By
Charles S. Brooks	PERSON	.

		184 pages .


Yale Univ.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Press .

		New Haven .

		Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	dons his carpet slippers with an un - disguised relish that is disarming , and carries the reader over discoursive pages with such a fund of good humor that the first impulse , which is to brdnd him old-fashioned , yields place to the enjoyment which comes with recognition of the companion - able quality in his essays .

		Chimney-Pot Papers might be termed essays in relaxation , written quietly and gracefully .

		The very titles give a cue to the mood , for Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	can wax pleasantly digres - sive over such topics as On Going Afoot , On Turn - ing into Forty , and On Going to a Party .

		The author splinters no lance in defense of these familiar excursions , nor does he apologize for his obvious likfng for those things which the majority have over - looked in their mad haste to be modern .

		After all , no one is so modern that he will not someday '' turn into forty '' unless the violence of his haste shat - ters his span so why not write about it , especially if it can be done with grace and good humor ?

		But when it comes to discoursing upon the difference between wit and humor , as Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	has the temerity to do , it is to be feared that the essayist has pilfered his point of view from a forgotten freshman theme .

		IN THE ALASKAN WILDERNESS .

		By
George Byron Gordon	PERSON	.

		247 pages .

		Winston ;
Phila	LOCATION	- delphia .

		Narrative charm in a book of exploration is a quality which appeals to the average reader when geographical exactitude and recondite scientific de - ductions are lost on him .

		This book has much of the former to commend it , though the author 's observations indicate that he is capable of profundity .

		Dr.
Gordon	PERSON	and his brother crossed nearly the entire width of
Alaska	LOCATION	in a canoe .

		Their craft was launched at Fairbanks on the
Tanana River	LOCATION	, a point which they evidently reached by steamers from
White Horse	ORGANIZATION	by way of the Yukon and the
Tanana	LOCATION	.

		They floated down this stream a distance of some two hundred miles to where it is joined by the Kan - tishna River , and thence poled against the current another hundred miles or more to
Lake Minchu	LOCATION	- mina , in which the
Kantishna	LOCATION	has its beginning .

		A ten-mile portage brought them to the
Kuskokwim	LOCATION	, and it was on this river that they traveled to the sea .

		So far as geographical information is concerned , , the book gains little importance from the fact that no white men had ever followed this route before ^ it gains much , however , from the author 's unortho - dox point of view .

		His sense of humor is unfailing .

		He looks upon adventure as mainly a spiritual matter , and what is to the orthodox explorer merely a means to an end becomes to him a noteworthy incident .

		The book is interesting for its minutiae quite as much as for its travel data .

		Thus a hungry lost dog that , failing to hear the call of the wild , joined their party , is the basis of several good pages .

		Further parentheses are reasons for retaining the Indian name '' Denali '' for what is called Mount McKmley on the maps , and some excellent re - marks concerning the inaptitude of missionaries in discouraging tribal ceremonies and dances among the Kuskwogamiut Indians .

		An anthro - pologist of some note , Dr.
Gordon	PERSON	's chief concern on this .

		trip was the study of the Indians , and he gives some enlightening views of their arts , cus - toms , and languages .

June 14	DATE	Books of the Fortnight Democratic Ideals and Reality , by
H. J. Mackinder	PERSON	-LRB- 266 pages ;
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- , throws the problems of international re - construction against their ultimate geographic back - ground .

		The author dogmatizes too confidently about the political elements considered , and the book is stronger in its perception of realities than in its ap - praisal of ideals .

		But Mr.
Mackinder	PERSON	is a vivid ex - ponent of the new regional geography and his con - ception of the
World Island	LOCATION	, the
Heartland	ORGANIZATION	, and the role of seamen , horsemen , and plowmen in the devel - opment of civilization amply makes up for his defects in political comprehension .

		International War , by
Oscar T. Crosby	PERSON	-LRB- 378 pages ; Mac - millan -RRB- , discusses the causes of war and the means for curing them .

		Written before the entrance of the
United States	LOCATION	, it was withheld from publication until the principles advocated had crept even into the coun - cils of statesmen .

		Towards New Horizons , by
M. P. Willcocks	PERSON	-LRB- 213 pages ; Lane -RRB- , is an English woman 's attempt to evaluate the contributions of the war to a new order in reli - gion , science , literature , labor , and politics a plea for a fresh beginning , with an entirely different objective .

		Reconstruction and
National Life	ORGANIZATION	, by
Cecil Fairfield La	ORGANIZATION	- veil -LRB- 193 pages ;
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , purposes to suggest an historical approach to the problem of reconstruction in
Europe	LOCATION	, viewed as a matter of national adjustment .

		As an interpretation it is superficial ; as a history , in - complete .

		American Business in World Markets , by
James T. M. Moore	PERSON	-LRB- 320 pages ;
Doran	PERSON	-RRB- , exploits the plausible commercial possibilities of what the author believes is going to be a Business Man 's Era .

		There is nothing in his postulates to show that he has been alive during the last generation .

		Efficient Railway Operation , by
Henry S. Haines	PERSON	-LRB- 709 pages ;
Macmillan	PERSON	-RRB- , is a technical treatise covering a field familiar to the author as administrator , opera - tive head , and ^ engineer .

		There is a short introduc - tion on the evolution of the railway .

		Punishment and Reformation , by
Frederick Howard Wines	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- 481 pages ;
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , appears now in a third edition , with additions and revisions by
Winthrop D. Lane	PERSON	, of the Survey staff .

		By incorporating the latest contributions to criminal anthropology , to the study of the individual delinquent , and to the rehabilita - tion of the criminal through occupational and politi - cal therapy , Mr.
Lane	PERSON	has given the freshness of youth to a classic that was far from senility .

		Punish - ment and
Reformation	ORGANIZATION	is a book for the citizen , as well as for the social worker and the official , and to the extent that it succeeds in tempering the judgment of the whole community it is above all things a book for the criminal .

		A New Municipal Program , edited by

Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , brings together com - pactly the experience gained in municipal administra - tion since the organization of the

Cannan	PERSON	has already made as bright as day .

		Bureau of
American Ethnology	ORGANIZATION	, Annual Report , 1910-11 -LRB- 819 pages ;
Government Printing Office	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is dated
1918	DATE	.

		It is a rich storehouse of Seneca fiction , legends , and myths .

		The chief fault of this wide margined , bulky volume is that of so many other government publications it was never meant to be read .

		The Last Million , by `` Ian Hay '' -LRB- Major Ian Hay Beith ; 203 pages ;
Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	-RRB- , is no
King Canute	ORGANIZATION	's chronicle , attempting to sweep back the tide .

		Major Beith takes the war for granted and writes of accom - modation rather than of rebellion ; he sits down inside a finished universe to chat familiarly of what hap - pens when the object of construction is destruction and death is the day 's business .

		The new volume no more lives up to The
First Hundred Thousand	ORGANIZATION	than the peace has lived up to the war .

		The War Romance of the
Salvation Army	ORGANIZATION	, by
Evange	ORGANIZATION	- line Booth and
Grace Livingston Hill	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- 356 pages ;
Lippincott	LOCATION	;
Philadelphia	LOCATION	-RRB- , shows alarming symptoms of that attudinizing from which the war activities of the
Salvation Army	ORGANIZATION	were notably free .

		The sequence of prosperity and decay is familiar in the history of earlier mendicant orders ; does it threaten to repeat itself ?

		Anatole
France	LOCATION	, by
Lewis Piaget Shanks	PERSON	-LRB- 241 pages ; Open Court ;
Chicago	LOCATION	-RRB- , is a biographical record of its subject with some critical comment .

		It is a question whether an Anglo-Saxon can penetrate the secret of
Anatole France	LOCATION	, but Professor
Shanks	PERSON	has illuminated his subject conscientiously .

		Reading the
Bible	LOCATION	, by
William Lyon Phelps	PERSON	-LRB- 131 pages ;
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , exhibits the author in the act of carrying a very light burden of coals to
Newcastle	LOCATION	.

		If the theological students who first heard these collected lec - tures were not already convinced that the
Bible	LOCATION	is good reading , there was little here to win them to new tastes .


Luna Benamor	PERSON	, by
Blasco Ibanez	PERSON	, translated by
Isaac Goldberg	PERSON	-LRB- 209 pages ;
Luce	PERSON	;
Boston	LOCATION	-RRB- , is a collection of short stories of which the most pretentious gives title to the volume .

		This is a Jewish-Spanish love story , heavy with local color .

		The short tales which complete the volume are in the staccato manner of
Maupassant	LOCATION	, mere local situations without the sugges - tion of wider application that makes Maupassant a fabulist .

		The Home and the World , by Sir
Rabindranath Tagore	PERSON	, translated by
Surendranath Tagore	PERSON	-LRB- 298 pages ; Mac - millan -RRB- , is the first novel by the distinguished poet of modern
India	LOCATION	.

		It is a story of Hindu family life affected by the storm of revolution in the world out - side .

		The narrative consists of successive confessions by the three characters : Nikhil , the moderate husband ;
Bimala	LOCATION	, the ^ enthusiastic wife ; and
Sandip	PERSON	, the inter - loper , who introduces into the home the mingled ele - ments of patriotism and passion .

		The unpretending realism of the book and its philosophy are of the
East	LOCATION	and true ; the weakly managed complication and imported conclusion are of the West , and imitated .

		The Valley of the Squinting Windows , by
Brinsley Mac	ORGANIZATION	-
Namara	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- 296 pages ; Brentano -RRB- , is an epic of mean - ness .

		The author attempts to do for the Irish novel what
Synge	PERSON	did for the Irish drama , and the result is an interesting piece of pessimistic realism , some - what Hardyesque in effect The malignant spirit of the valley , nurturing carefully the memory of the heroine 's early sin , wreaks destruction of soul upon all those involved , and finally blots out her hard - bought dream of proud atonement .

		In fact , were it not for the disclosure on the wrapper , one would become securely enmeshed in the plot before discovering that there is so much as a secret agent on the premises .

		With a crisp , vivid style , perhaps too obviously imitative of
Wells	LOCATION	, she has posed for a section of
London	LOCATION	stay-at-home society the holo - caust of youth in

		As a student of char - acter however she is unsatisfactory .

		Labels may do well enough for subsidiary persons , but we demand more than strangely assorted posters when we meet
Dominic Roydon	PERSON	, the magnetic clergyman , and
Sylvia Tracy	PERSON	, the heroine .

		Mrs.
Rickard	PERSON	gives us little aid in our search for hidden mechanisms and motives that is , for the storm caves of character .

		War memoirs and letters and that sort of thing are quite generally losing their edge ; perhaps be - cajise fighting experiences , though varied , tend finally to fall into classifications , and are capable of rising into life again only at the touch of genius .

THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	,
May 22	DATE	, in honor of Pro- fessor
George V. Lomonossoff	PERSON	and Mr.
L. A. Martens	PERSON	, at which five hundred guests were present , a resolution was passed '' re - affirming our faith in the Russian people , our sympathy with their effort to establish democratic institutions of their own choosing , and our protest against all forms of military intervention and eco - nomic blockade designed to modify such institutions and exploit the country in the interest of foreign powers '' ; also pledging `` our best efforts to persuade our government to recognize the govern - ment of the Russian Soviet Republic . ''

		In order to give the American people an opportunity to de - mand repudiation of the policy which the executive has applied toward
Russia	LOCATION	, the following protest has been drawn up .

		A Plea for a Just
American Policy Towards Russia We	ORGANIZATION	, as citizens of the
United States	LOCATION	, call upon the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of the
United States	LOCATION	to bring about the abolition of the blockade against the Russian Soviet Republic .

		Without declaring war upon
Russia	LOCATION	we have permitted the blockade to bring death to hundreds of thousands every month , by starvation .

		We urge the immediate recall of all American troops in Rus - sia , and the abandonment of attempts to secure special troops for service there .

		That is no service for the soldiers of a democracy .

		We earnestly protest against our government 's conniving or collaborating with any counter-revolutionary groups , such as those of Kolchak or
Denikin	PERSON	, servers of a discredited monarchical regime .

		We hold that the American government must do nothing that will hinder the Russian people from determining their form of gov - ernment , in accordance with their own economic and political ideals .

		In sum , we demand that
Congress	ORGANIZATION	exercise its constitutional functions for the purpose of creating a genuinely democratic foreign policy , consistent with the traditions of a nation which cherishes honorable memories of the revolution by which it was founded , and the civil war by which it was perpetuated .

		-LRB- Signed -RRB- Affix your name to this plea and send it immediately to your representatives and senators , with as many additional signatures as you can get .

		THE DIAL A
FORTNIGHTLY TH Economic Unity and Political Division	ORGANIZATION	.

		HE POLITICAL UNITY of the world , which is the avowed aim of the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	, may or may not be achieved in the next few years ; indeed , any but a very bold optimist must incline to the view that it will not .

		But the economic unity of the world has been furthered by the war to a very sur - prising extent .

		Conditions are , of course , still ab - normal , but we may expect much of what has resulted in the way of international economic gov - ernment to remain for a long time to come .

		Certain Powers , notably the
United States	LOCATION	and the British Empire , control the supplies of food and raw mate - rial sufficiently to be able to decide , throughout the greater part of the civilized world , who shall starve and who shall have enough to eat , who shall be allowed to develop industries and who shall be compelled to import manufactured goods .

		This power is the result partly of geographical advan - tages , partly of armed force , especially at sea .

		Financial strength also plays its part , but is a result of geographical and military superiority rather than an independent cause of dominion .

		If
Germany	LOCATION	had won the war , it may be assumed that indemnities would have fundamentally altered the balance of financial strength .

		The necessity of rationing supplies has created , unavoidably , an international way of dealing with problems of distribution .

		Those who control inter - national distribution have a degree of power ex - ceeding anything previously known in the history of the world .

		The growth of industrialism in the century before the war led most nations to become dependent upon foreign countries for supplies indis - pensable to life or at least to prosperity .

		Cessation of foreign supplies would mean inability to support the actual population in health , as it has meant in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Consequently it is impossible for any European nation to return to economic independence except through a period of intolerable hardship , in - volving death or emigration on a large scale .

		Only extreme heroism prolonged through many years would enable a continental country to free itself from the economic dominion which has resulted from the war .

		This economic dominion has given to the world , as regards material things , a new unity and a new central authority .

		But while material unity has been more or less accidentally achieved , unity in any higher sense has not been even approached .

		The
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	, so far from being world-wide , is in effect an alliance of
America	LOCATION	,
Britain	LOCATION	, and
France	LOCATION	, with
Italy	LOCATION	as a somewhat doubtful hanger-on .


Japan	LOCATION	, which is nominally a member of the League , is mainly en - gaged in the attempt to absorb
China	LOCATION	an enter - prise by no means calculated to win the affection of
America	LOCATION	.

		From the Pacific to the
Rhine	LOCATION	, the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	appears as an enemy or a master , not as a free union of equal democracies .

		The world is thus divided into three groups : the Western nations , the outcasts
Germany	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	, and the Yellow Races , among whom the Japanese are masters and the Chinese unwilling servants .

		It is in such a world that the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	is to make its debut .

		The distinction of capitalist and proletarian has been made familiar by the writings of the Socialists .

		But this distinction has now taken a new form : there are capitalist and proletarian nations .


Russia	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	are proletarian nations , the former still on strike , the latter probably about to make a sullen submission .

		By the economic provisions of the
Peace Treaty	ORGANIZATION	, it is _ secured -LRB- as far as such things carr be -RRB- that Germans shall , for an indefinite time to come , be very much poorer than inhabitants of the Western democracies .

		They are to do speci - fied work for the capitalist nations , obtaining pre - sumably wages , but not profits .

		They are to be deprived of an enormous proportion of their ships , coal , and iron , .

		and in every way prevented from competing with our trade .

		If they nevertheless do find ways of making money , they are to be deprived of what they make in order to provide reparation for the war .

		Their national situation , in short , is to be as similar as possible to the individual situation of a wage-earner in a capitalist community .

		Their reward for accepting our terms is to be that they are to have enough to eat to support life ; their punishment for rejecting them , that their numbers are to be reduced by starvation until they submit .

		-LRB- This is a slight exaggeration of our generosity .

		At a moment when large numbers of German in - fants are dying for lack of milk , the Peace Treaty 630 THE DIAL
June 28	DATE	demands the surrender by
Germany	LOCATION	of a hundred and forty thousands of milch-cows . -RRB-

		In industrial disputes , we are accustomed to subjugation of strikers by these means .

		But it marks the growth of economic ways of thought that the methods of labor disputes should be applied in dealing with a vanquished nation .

		As to
Russia	LOCATION	, it is as yet impossible to know what will happen .

		It is conceivable that , by sufficient determination ,
Russia	LOCATION	may succeed in becoming economically self-sufficient .

		If so , war-weariness may compel the Allies to abandon the policy of intervention .

		But if
Russia	LOCATION	is not willing to face the hardships involved in an economic boycott , or if the Allies can raise sufficient armies to occupy the centres of Bolshevik power , it will become necessary for the Russians , as for the Germans , to submit to our terms and accept whatever form of government we may think good for them .

		The Germans were informed that we should be more lenient if they expelled the
Kaiser	LOCATION	; probably the Russians will soon be informed that we shall be more lenient if they restore the Tsardom .

		In that case , no doubt , they , like the Germans , may be granted a peace of justice and mercy , not of revenge .

		-LRB- The peace terms seem to me to combine justice with mercy .

		The Bishop of
London	LOCATION	. -RRB-

		But if they persist in Bolshevism , we may discover what it is that the Germans have been spared as a consequence of their adoption of democracy .

		We see , in the two cases of
Germany	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	, the two purposes for which the power of the sword is being used , namely -LRB- a -RRB- to extort economic ad - vantages ; -LRB- b -RRB- to impose a form of government other than that desired by those upon whom it is imposed .

		I do not wish to blame in any way the individuals who are carrying out these two purposes .

		I believe that many of them are completely blind to what is really happening : they feel that
Germany	LOCATION	, as the disturber of the peace , must be rendered harmless , and that
Russia	LOCATION	, as the perpetrator of endless atrocities against the well-to-do , must be forced to adopt again the '' civilized '' government which it enjoyed before the Revolution , whose much greater atrocities they forget because the capitalist press did not exploit them .

		Others , though they may see and regret the evil that is being done , accept it as inevit - able in order to inaugurate the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	; and in the disarmament of
Germany	LOCATION	they see the first step towards universal disarmament .

		Many others , again , sincerely believe that it is the business of a statesman to think only of the interests of his ow.n country : they feel themselves in the position of trustees , and regard '' sacred egoism '' as their duty .

		For all these reasons , it would be foolish to attach moral blame to those who direct the power of the Allies .

		Like everybody else , they are products of circumstances and systems .

		We have to understand their action , and to form an opinion as to whether it is for the good of the world ; but if our opinion is adverse , we must go behind the men to the system which has produced them , and ask ourselves whether , under that system , anything better could be expected .

		The capitalist system of industry , whatever its merits , has not been found conducive to perfect harmony between capital and labor .

		It is hardly to be expected that its extension to international rela - tions will produce harmony between States , or that
Germany	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	will be filled with ardent love for the Western nations during the next few years .

		They may be powerless in a military sense , just as labor organizations are ; but , like labor organiza - tions , they may find other ways than war by which their grievances can be forced upon the attention of their masters .

		I do not wish to be misunderstood when I speak of '' grievances '' : what I am saying is wholly independent of the question whether they are justified in feeling grievances .

		I say only that they will feel them , and that in fact their economic position will be less fortunate than ours , as a result of their defeat in the war .

		And this situation is not one likely to inaugurate a period of international amity , or to realize the dreams of those who died in
France	LOCATION	believing that our aim was to destroy mili - tarism and establish universal freedom .

		It is economic considerations mainly that have caused the severity of the peace terms and the im - placable hostility to the Bolsheviks .

		-LRB- Those who think the hostility to the Bolsheviks is due to their atrocities are putting the cart before the horse , and are failing to realize how their own horror of these atrocities has been stimulated .

		The Tsar 's govern - ment was guilty of many more and much worse atrocities , but it was not to the interest of the capitalist press to make our blood boil about them . -RRB-

		Economic considerations of this sort are inseparable from the capitalist system .

		Probably every allied nation , as a whole , will be worse off economically if
Germany	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	are ruined than if they are prosperous , but many individual capitalists will profit by the removal of competitors , and these individuals , through the press , have power to mold public opinion .

		Moreover , under the existing economic system , competition is the very air we breathe , and men come to feel more pleasure in outstripping a competitor than in the absolute level of their prosperity .

		If , by slightly impoverishing ourselves , we can very greatly impoverish the Ger - mans , we feel that we have achieved a valuable result .

		This state of mind is so bound up with capitalism that we can not hope to see it effectively removed while capitalism persists .

		1919 THE DIAL 631 I do not despair of the world ; I do not think it impossible that the idealistic aims which inspired many of those who fought in the war may in time be achieved .

		But I think a lesson is to be learned from President
Wilson	PERSON	's failure , and the lesson is this : The removal of international rivalry , and the growth of real co-operation among all civilized nations , is not to be attained while competition , exploitation , and the ruthless use of economic power govern the whole machinery of production and dis - tribution .

		It is scarcely to be expected that the relations between States will be immeasurably more humane than the relations between individuals within a
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		So long as the whole organized machinery of the
State	ORGANIZATION	is used to defend men who live in idle luxury on the labor of others , and to obstruct those others in attempts to secure a more just system , the natural assumptions of men who possess authority can scarcely be such as to restrain them from a ruthless use of force in their dealings with hostile countries .

		International justice and lasting peace are not to be secured while capitalism persists .

		It is especially in
America	LOCATION	that belief in funda - mental economic reconstruction is needed .

		America has always stood for the ideas which are now known as '' Liberal . ''

		In
1776	DATE	, these ideas , as embodied in the Declaration of Independence , represented the Extreme Left , just as much as Bolshevism does now .

		But even the most advanced ideas can not be allowed to stand still for a century and a half without rind - ing themselves outstripped by later comers .

		Liberal ideas are admirable in circumstances which allow a prosperous career to any tolerably vigorous person .

		Americans , with an immensely rich and fertile con - tinent waiting for their advent , required energy and enterprise and initiative , but little else .

		They pos - sessed these qualities in a supreme degree ; they developed their continent with almost incredible rapidity and skill .

		In the course of their progress , almost against their will , they have been driven into the position of arbiters of the world 's destiny .

		They may hesitate for a time , they may be reluctant to undertake the responsibilities of the
League of Nations	ORGANIZATION	, but the power is unavoidably theirs .

		With the power comes responsibility , however they may hesitate to assume it ; and from sense of responsi - bility to love of dominion is unfortunately a fatally easy step .

		The
United States	LOCATION	, having the oppor - tunity of ruling the world , is almost certain , before long , to acquire a taste for doing so .

		The sources of American power , so far as can be seen , are not merely momentary .

		It is true that , at the end of the war ,
America	LOCATION	has certain special advantages : unimpaired wealth , few casualties in spite of large numbers of trained soldiers , a newly - acquired fleet of merchant ships , and an opportunity of securing naval supremacy .

		But apart from tem - porary advantages , there are_pthers of a more per - manent sort , which seem likely to increase rather than diminish : an invulnerable territory , the possi - bility of complete economic self-sufficiency , with a rapidly increasing white population , already larger than the white population of any other single
State	ORGANIZATION	, and full of all the qualities that promote national strength .

		No other
State	ORGANIZATION	can compete against this combination of felicitous circumstances .

		Whatever
America	LOCATION	may vigorously desire , the world will have to accept .

		So long as
America	LOCATION	is content to believe in the Liberal ideas of
1776	DATE	, so long not only Bolsheviks or Spartacists , but even conventional Socialists , can not hope to maintain themselves for more than a moment in any important country : their existence will be inconvenient to American capital , and therefore , through the usual channels for edu - cating public opinion , odious to the American nation .

		We in the older countries , where oppor - tunities are fewer , and '' la carriere ouverte aux talents '' is a less all-sufficient gospel , are turning more and more towards co-operation as against com - petition , Socialism as against plutocracy .

		A
Labor Government	ORGANIZATION	is likely in this country at no distant date ;
France	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	may well follow suit .

		But nothing that we can do will be secure or stable while
America	LOCATION	remains faithful to the creed of ruthless individual competition .

		We are thus brought back to the point from which we started : the economic unity of the world .

		The Labor Movement must be international or doomed to perpetual failure ; it must conquer Amer - ica or forego success in
Europe	LOCATION	until some very distant future .

		Which of these will happen , I do not profess to know .

		But I do know that a great responsibility rests upon those who mold progressive thought in
America	LOCATION	: the responsibility of realizing the new international importance of
America	LOCATION	, and of understanding why the shibboleths of traditional Liberalism no longer satisfy European lovers of justice .

		The only right use of power is to promote freedom .

		The nominal freedom of the wage-slave is a sham and a delusion , as great a sham as the nominal freedom which the
Peace Treaty	ORGANIZATION	leaves to the Germans .

		Will
America	LOCATION	, in her ` future career of power , content herself with the illusory freedom that exists under capitalist domination ?

		Or will her missionary spirit once more , as in the days of
Jefferson	LOCATION	, urge men on along the way to the most complete freedom that is possible in the cir - cumstances of the time ?

		It is a momentous ques - tion ; upon the answer depends the whole future of the human race .

		BERTRAND RUSSELL .

		632 THE DIAL
June 28	DATE	The Ruin of
Bourgeois France	LOCATION	V_yNE OF THE SHREWDEST and best-informed ob - servers of international politics that I know said in a letter which I received from him a few days ago : `` The economic danger of
France	LOCATION	is the key to the whole future of
Europe	LOCATION	. ''

		I am convinced that he is right .

		The critical economic and financial situa - tion in which the war has placed
France	LOCATION	is also the key to the impossible conditions imposed on
Germany	LOCATION	by the Allies .

		The French bourgeoisie sees ruin staring it in the face and its only hope of escape is to enslave
Germany	LOCATION	and force her to support
France	LOCATION	.

		Nothing else can prevent the inevitable col - lapse or avert national bankruptcy and that means the end of the bourgeoisie and of the capitalist sys - tem .

		The peace treaty is a desperate attempt to make
Germany	LOCATION	support
France	LOCATION	.

		It can not succeed .

		For
Germany	LOCATION	is not in a condition to give the support required and , even if she signs the treaty , she will not be able to fulfil its conditions .

		The French bourgeoisie has committed suicide as surely as did the French noblesse of the i8th cen - tury .

		For more than a century It has been the rul - ing class , but the days of its ascendency are num - bered .

		M.
Charles Maurras	PERSON	recently expressed in the Royalist paper ,
L ` Action Franchise	ORGANIZATION	, the opinion that revolution is imminent ; he believes that it will come when the public in general realizes that it was deceived when it was told that
Germany	LOCATION	would pay for the war and realizes also the consequences of
Germany	LOCATION	's inability to pay .

		tie is almost certainly right .

		The realization may be a matter of weeks or months it may take longer but sooner or later it is inevitable and its consequences are no less inevitable .

		The revolution may be preceded by a `` White Terror '' or a coup d'etat but it will come .

		There has been since the Armistice a formidable increase in the cost of living in
France	LOCATION	, which was already much higher than in
England	LOCATION	, and it con - tinues to increase .

		The GEuvre said on
May 22	DATE	that prices in
Paris	LOCATION	had risen about twenty per cent during the last three months , that is to say , since the institution of the
Government	ORGANIZATION	booths which , according to the optimistic prophecy of their au - thor ,
M. Vilgrain	PERSON	, were to reduce the cost of living forty per cent , in a fortnight .

		Sugar is unobtain - able , butter adulterated with margarine is
$ 1.50	MONEY	a pound ; potatoes cost
five cents	MONEY	each , French beans ,
fifty cents	MONEY	a pound , and the prices of meat are fan - tastic ranging from about
sixty cents	MONEY	to
$ 1.50	MONEY	a pound .

		Clothes and other necessaries are propor - tionately dear and the landlords are raising the rents about fifty per cent .

		In these circumstances it is difficult for the poor to live at all , especially as wages in
France	LOCATION	have not risen during the war to the same extent as in
England	LOCATION	and their increase is much smaller in proportion than the increase in the cost of living .

		Before the war , wages were con - siderably lower in
France	LOCATION	than in
England	LOCATION	and the cost of living was about forty per cent higher .

		The present high prices are to a great extent the result of the policy of
M. Loucheur	PERSON	, whom
M. Clemenceau	PERSON	has placed at the
Ministry of Recon	ORGANIZATION	- struction .

		M. Loucheur is interested in a large number of industrial concerns , he has made a huge fortune out of the war , and his notion of recon - struction is to promote the interests of himself and his fellow-profiteers at the expense of the consumer .

		An illuminating article on
M. Loucheur	ORGANIZATION	's policy by
M. Francis Delaisi	PERSON	, than whom there could be no more competent authority on the subject , was pub - lished in the
Manchester Guardian	ORGANIZATION	on
May 15	DATE	.

		That policy chiefly consists in closing the French market to all English and American manufactured goods , although they are urgently needed in
France	LOCATION	and have been offered at low prices ; only raw ma - terials in the strictest sense of the term '' matieres '' brutes '' as distinguished from '' matieres premieres '' in general may be imported without permission .


M. Delaisi	PERSON	says that American machines actually bought by the
Roubaix	LOCATION	spinners have been counter - manded by order of the
Government	ORGANIZATION	and that
Ford	ORGANIZATION	motorcars , bought and paid for by the
State	ORGANIZATION	, are rusting in the port of
Bordeaux	LOCATION	.

		I may add that M. Loucheur recently fixed by decree prices of paper considerably in excess of the market value , because the French paper trust happens to have large stocks in hand and prices were beginning to fall in spite of the restriction of imports .

		The high prices and the consequent misery are , therefore , partly the consequences of the deliberate policy of the
Government	ORGANIZATION	, that is , of the bourgeoisie .

		Unrestricted importation ,
M. Delaisi	PERSON	says , would enable the reconstruction of the invaded depart - ments to be rapidly completed .

		But that would not suit the profiteers , so
M. Loucheur	PERSON	has announced in the Chamber of Deputies that reconstruction will not begin seriously for two years and
M. Delaisi	PERSON	says that it will take at least two years more to re - establish the steel works , five or six years to set cer - tain mines going and sixteen years , according to an official report , to rebuild all the houses .

		The de - vastated regions , says this eminent French econo - mist , ' `` will have to wait till the factories behind them are readv to work for them . ''

		1919 THE DIAL 6 33 One of the excuses given for this policy is the necessity of keeping up the rate of exchange and that excuse has until now kept public opinion more or less quiet .

		But it will do so no longer , for the rate of exchange is rapidly falling against
France	LOCATION	in spite of the prohibition of imports and at the time of writing is about frs .3 O. 5O to the pound sterling and frs .6.5 O to the dollar .

		It is likely to go on falling unless American and British financiers con - sent to bolster it up as they did during the war .

		But such expedients can not be permanent .

		Many financial experts consider that the real value of the franc in
England	LOCATION	is now not more than about six - pence and sooner or later it will find its true level .

		The depreciation of the French currency is the natural result of the reckless issue of paper money .

		The total value of the French banknotes in circu - lation at the end of
1911	DATE	was
$ 1,360,000,000	MONEY	; in
August 1917	DATE	, it was
$ 2,400,000,000	MONEY	; it is now
$ 8	MONEY	, - 000,000,000 .

		Against this huge issue of forced paper currency the
Bank of France	ORGANIZATION	has a gold and silver reserve of only 1,170,000,000 .

		Of the total value of banknotes in circulation the sum of
$ 5	MONEY	, - 400,000,000 is a loan from the
Bank of France	ORGANIZATION	to the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		For the
French Government	ORGANIZATION	has now resorted to the expedient of meeting the national expenditure by the issue of paper money .

		A further issue of
$ 800,000,000	MONEY	has just been authorized it is included in the total quoted of which
$ 600,000	MONEY	, - ooo represent a loan from the
Bank of France	ORGANIZATION	to the
State	ORGANIZATION	to meet the deficit on the budget for the next three months .

		But that deficit will be much larger unless the holders of War Bonds -LRB- `` Bons de la De - fense Nationale '' -RRB- now falling due consent to re - new them , for the receipts from taxes for the three months are estimated at only
$ 560,000,000	MONEY	, whereas the estimated expenditure is
$ 2	MONEY	, 600,000,000 .

		The `` Bons de la
Defense Nationale	ORGANIZATION	'' are repayable three , six or twelve months after issue and the amount issued and unredeemed up to
January	DATE	was
$ 4,600	MONEY	, - 000,000 .

		The receipts from taxes thus meet little more than one-fifth of the current expenditure and the balance has to be found by the issue of paper money and by borrowing at short term .

		The finances of
France	LOCATION	are being conducted on the prin - ciples of a spendthrift `` fils de famille . ''

		The Na - tional Debt , which at the outbreak of the war was
$ 6,400,000,000	MONEY	was
$ 33,600,000,000	MONEY	three months ago and is still increasing .

		For this state of affairs the bourgeoisie has a heavy responsibility by its obstinate refusal to make any contribution worth mentioning to the cost of the war .

		The Income Tax , adopted by the Chamber in
1909	DATE	and hung up for years by the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, was at last applied in an emasculated form during the war in spite of the violent protests of the bour - geoisie and its organs in the press , but even now its highest rate is only twenty per cent on the largest incomes and that rate is not payable on the whole of the income .

		Moreover the whole agricultural population about half the population of
France	LOCATION	is entirely exempted from it and there is reason to believe that the rich make very imperfect - returns , of their incomes , which are accepted without any serious investigation .

		In any case the income tax has produced much less than it should have pro- duced even at its present rate and its collection is considerably in arrear .

		While the bourgeoisie refused to pay for the war , it is the class chiefly responsible for its prolongation .

		Almost at any time after the middle of
1915	DATE	, plebis - cite would have resulted in a large majority for peace by negotiation , and at least three times dur - ing the war the feeling of the country was so strong that
France	LOCATION	was within an ace of a successful move - ment to stop the war .

		Had not the
United States	LOCATION	came in when they did ,
France	LOCATION	would have gone out of the war in the
Spring of 1917	DATE	and in
May 1918	DATE	the internal situation was again critical .

		But the Parisian bourgeoisie , as has so often happened during the last hundred years , succeeded in keeping its grip on the country by means of the centralized
Administration	ORGANIZATION	and persisted in continuing the war to the bitter end to the `` Pyrrhic victory '' which , according to
M. Clemenceau	PERSON	,
France	LOCATION	has at last won .

		It did so chiefly because it believed that
Germany	LOCATION	would pay .

		Whenever one urged that the cost should be counted , whenever one tried to point out the inevitable ruin to which
France	LOCATION	was being con - ducted , that was the invariable reply : `` Les Alle - mands paieront . ''

		Many people were even deluded enough to believe that
France	LOCATION	would make a profit out of the war .

		The indemnity : that was the aim for which the French bourgeoisie continued the war , more than for any Imperialist designs , even more than for
Alsace-Lorraine	LOCATION	.

		The general pub - lic shared the delusion to a great extent and the belief that
Germany	LOCATION	would pay alone induced the French people to go on .

		Now the bourgeoisie recognizes that
Germany	LOCATION	can not pay and it is aghast at the ruin that con - fronts it .

		And the public that has been deceived is beginning to realize that fact .

		The
Government	ORGANIZATION	resorts to the desperate expedients that have been described in order , if possible , to postpone the day of reckoning .

		On the one hand it tries by the peace treaty to make
Germany	LOCATION	support
France	LOCATION	; on the other hand it hopes that by means of paper money and war bonds it may succeed in evading the solu - 634 THE DIAL
June 28	DATE	tion of the financial problems at least until after the general election and in bequeathing it as a legacy to its successors .

		Poor
M. Klotz	PERSON	can not even sug - gest a possible solution of that problem ; indeed there is none .

		It is a vicious circle : if the rate of ex - change falls , French importers pay more for every - thing that they buy , but it can be kept up only by restricting imports ; if imports are restricted , prices will go on - rising in
France	LOCATION	and the invaded regions will wait for their reconstruction ; if fresh issues of paper money continue , the currency must be de - preciated and the exchange will fall in spite of the restriction of imports , but without fresh issues of paper money it will be impossible to make both ends meet .

		Current expenditures can be met in no other way without an income tax averaging something like sixty per cent all round , which is impossible , for it would mean either starvation for people with small incomes or a tax of 100 per cent on large incomes ; and even such a tax would not cover all the liabilities of the next two years .

		In fact
France	LOCATION	is insolvent and the only possible way out is bankruptcy the repudiation of the Na - tional Debt .

		When the pressure becomes intoler - able , that will be demanded by the mass of the people .

		During the last three months Socialism has made immense strides .

		The circulation of L'Humanite which was only 55,000 in
October	DATE	, has risen to more than 200,000 .

		The peasants , dis - gusted with the economic and financial conse - quences of the war , for which they were never en - thusiastic , are turning towards the Socialist party .

		The salaried proletariat , if one may so call it , is uniting with the proletariat paid by wages .

		Actors and scene-shifters combine in the same
Trade Union	ORGANIZATION	, which is affiliated to the
General Confederation of Labor	ORGANIZATION	, and 25,000 bank clerks on strike have marched down the
Grand Boulevards	LOCATION	of
Paris	LOCATION	.

		This union between the headworkers and the hand - workers is one of the most striking signs of change .

		The bourgeoisie might perhaps save itself at the eleventh hour by accepting a large levy on capital , but it is probably too late even for that to save it and in any case the bourgeoisie will never consent to any pecuniary sacrifice .

		`` These people are quite ready to give their sons to be killed , '' said an em - inent Frenchman some three years ago of the French bourgeoisie , `` but you must n't ask them for five francs . ''

		The downfall of the French bourgeoisie will be the penalty of a selfishness and an avarice unsur - passed by any class in any country or any age .

		For nearly five years it has gambled with the lives of men for the stake of a crushing indemnity ; and it has lost .

		What we must hope for is that the So - cialist and
Trade Union	ORGANIZATION	leaders will be strong enough and will have behind them a sufficiently strong organization to prevent violence and blood - shed , for the wrath of a deceived and ruined people will be terrible .

		And there is not too much time to prepare for the consequences that the coming ca - tastrophe in
France	LOCATION	will have for the rest of
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- rope and of the world .

		One explanation that has been given of Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's concessions to French , British , and Italian Imperialism and of his lamentable compromises on his principles is that he feared to precipitate a revo - lution in
France	LOCATION	if he retired from the peace con - ference .

		It is possible that the explanation has some foundation and , if Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	had such a fear , there was some justification for it .

		But it is not a sufficient reason for his capitulation , for , if the fear be justified , the French Government at any rate would have yielded rather than allow Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	to withdraw .

		And Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's capitu - lation has only made the revolution more certain .

		Had he stood firm and secured a peace in accord - ance with the principles which he laid down and which the Allies and
Germany	LOCATION	accepted , he might have saved bourgeois society at least for a time .

		His failure is regarded as the final failure of the bourgeoisie and has convinced the mass of the peo - ple whose hopes in him have been so bitterly disappointed , that there is nothing to hope from a capitalist society and that only a radical change can make possible the ideals which Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	aimed at and has failed to attain .

		Perhaps the future will show that Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	, by his weakness , drove the last nail into the coffin of European capitalism .

ELIZABETH J. COATSWORTH	PERSON	.

		1919 THE DIAL 6 35 A Word About Realism ` SCAR WILDE defined art as the telling of beauti - ful lies .

		His own work is the best example of his theory .

		The working out of such a doctrine is , at its highest , De Profundis , which , written in the in - sight and the inspiration of forced asceticism in prison , becomes a travesty in the light of later events .

		Even Reading Gaol falls short of perfection by just those conscious repetitions and sounding phrases which indicate that the poet 's eye was fixed not on truth but on the attempt to make beauty serve a lie .

		Wilde 's case is the case for all anti-realists , whether their banner be marked Classic or Romantic .

		Such labels are themselves subject to gradual revision in so far as they indicate living tendencies .

		It is one whom the professors of literature dub a romanticist who enunciated the eternal motto of realism , threw down the gage of defiance to the whole theory of art as decorative or formal or symbolic or vague or creative of a super-real : Beauty is truth , truth beauty ; that is all We know on earth and all we need to know .

		The realist is the indomitable searcher after that truth .

		He is the writer humble enough to conceive that truth as the world gives it to him is of more worth than a universe created out of his own omnip - otence .

		He maintains that the man to whom truth as he sees it is not more beautiful than any lie can no more create a work of art than he can live an effective life .

		After all , since we are not God we must remain subjects , not makers , of the uni - verse .

		Many of us have no personal memory of the nineteenth century storm against Zola ; we were not N even intrigued into an interest in Russian novels by the necessity of reading them in the attic or the woodshed .

		But we still catch echoes of a concep - tion of realism which shows the inconvenience of static terms to express growing processes .

		Some aroma of distaste still clings to the word ; for when a friend remarked in literary company that realistic writing is the only kind worth doing , the remark was not ignored as a platitude , but was combatted with some heat as either a wilful paradox or a woefully erroneous doctrine .

		When this odor of unsanctity is analyzed , three distinct connotations of the term realism may be detected .

		The first is the view that realism is non-selective , photographic , a `` cross-section of life '' ; the second is the notion that realism consists of the outpourings of minds morbidly attentive to sewer - age , like the dirt eaters noted in books on abnormal psychology ; the third , brought upon us by the ad - vent of free verse and the return of the three volume novel , accuses realism of indifference to or opposi - tion to all `` form . ''

		The modern development of realism has certain definite and easily discernible characteristics , but they are not these .

		I do not know whether any writer has tried to give a photographic presentation of a single .

		hour in a single life if he seriously tried it , he either gave it up or landed in an asylum for the insane .

		Selection is not a desideratum of art : it is unavoidable .

		Not even the three volume novel would suffice for a complete account of that one hour .

		A `` cross-section of life '' may be had only by living through it , with the use of every sense .

		In his crabbed fashion ,
Hegel	PERSON	, who said many true things which few people have the patience to read , wrote that `` the real has an infinite number of marks . ''

		It can never be fully described .

		This residue of distinguishing marks is what differentiates it from any image we may form , however elaborate .

		The realist , then , like everyone else , must select .

		And , like everyone else , he must admit that his rank as an artist depends on what things he omits .

		When he tries faithfully to `` hold the mirror up to nature , '' he must acknowledge that even when we look at a landscape we do not see it all the vision is modified by selective attention .

		What will be seen depends on the observer .

		Thus , when op - ponents of the realists accuse them of wasting four hundred pages on the unimportant , when the pop - ular magazines praise their own `` red blooded fiction , packed with action , '' the difference of opinion hinges on what things are important , what constitutes action .

		Combing one 's hair is of course as genuinely action as is committing a murder .

		The sign of the realist is that he refuses to admit that murder is intrinsically more important than hair-combing .

		His attention is focused on action , not for its own sake , but for its significance in illumining humanity , in aiding our visual faculty to picture either outward appearance or inner mood .

		Indeed it is only in outward semblance that thoughts or emotions are ever revealed .

		Because he takes seriously this commonplace , the realist cares in - tensely how things look , and to him all details are important which help us to see .

		Action and thought or emotion are as body and mind .

		Mere adventure without meaning is as dull as noise without rhythm or tune .

		It does not so much matter what happens as how and why it happens .

		Irrelevant action in a story is annoying as a fire bell rung for a joke is annoying .

		We demand meaning behind events ; 6 3 6 THE DIAL
June 28	DATE	and meaning is in terms of the human mind .

		On the other hand , ideas or emotions in abstraction , with no body by which we can see them , are as futile as ghosts .

		But meaning is not always in - carnated in the most exciting events .

		When the realistic writer , therefore , descends to the appar - ently trivial , beware !

		For in literature , as in life , the trivial is most often the way of revelation .

		When the realist is accused of preoccupation with the gutter , he may well retort that such preoccupa - tion is on the contrary romantic .

		Reaction against the assertion that tragedy belongs only to crowned heads and that only a very limited range of experi - ence is appropriate to treatment in art , naturally led to a kicking of blithe heels in hitherto forbidden pastures , to a seeking for beauty in the `` totally un - inhabited interior , '' and to impatience with the long-trodden ways .

		But to glory in the sordid as such , to exalt the romance of ugliness , is foreign to the whole purpose of realistic fiction .

		It is sub - ordinating interest in humanity to interest in a dogma ; and this can never be realism .

		It lies deep in human nature to revel in doing what we have been taught is naughty ; the force of the reaction is one of the effects of a too close restriction .

		But the `` conspiracy of silence '' has been so long broken that the novelty of revolt is wearing off .

		Our serious novelists are tiring of an exclusive devotion to the analysis of sexual aberra - tions .

		They can no longer shock anybody , so what is the use ?

		They are regaining their sense of pro- portion , which means neither suppression nor over - emphasis .


Compton Mackenzie	PERSON	and
J. D. Beres	PERSON	- ford , for example , treat of sex with entire candor in its relation to life .

		But their books deal with the religious and economic adventures of their heroes , no less fully than with their sexual experiences .

		Will - iam McFee shows the same fine sense of the com - plexity of human experience .

		The realists are strong in the faith that where truth is , there beauty will be also .

		By `` unpleasant topics , '' the detractors of real - ism usually have reference to this question of sex .

		As a matter of fact , they do not object to the topic , but only to the topic when it is not treated romantically .

		So long as we have `` five reelers '' like The Gangster 's Girl , and plays like
Camille	PERSON	, and hundreds of best sellers whose one concern is the pursuit of a woman by a man , with the implica - tion that wedding bells ring down the curtain on interest in life , we can not hang as a millstone round the neck of the realist , preoccupation with sex and the sordid underworld .

		There is an old saw to the effect that ortho - doxy is my doxy and heterodoxy your doxy . ''

		` Form ' is my form ; your form is no form at all , '' says the metrist to the vers librist , the novel of `` construction '' to the novel like Sinister Street , which closes in the hero 's twenty-fourth year only because , the author assures us , it would take too long to continue it until he is seventy .

		But there is no disorder , says
Bergson	PERSON	; there are only , different kinds of order .

		So long as words are written in succession and books have somewhere an ending , there can be no absence of form .

		The crea - tion of new forms is by no means a new process .

		The molds into which an age pours its self-expres - sion have always been remodelled according to the needs and impulses of the time .

		No one nowadays writes blank verse epics or uses for his social satire the rhymed couplets of Pope .

		The innovation of blank verse in Elizabethan plays raised a commo - tion fully as violent as that directed against the Spoon River Anthology which itself , by the way , far from adopting a new form , harks back to the .

		Greek Anthology .

		Form is nothing but the chosen method of expression ; and so long as expression is sought at all , just so long must some method be chosen from among a multitude of possible methods , some form adopted or created .

		Already there are expounders of the formalistic elements in free verse .

		Already there is some recognition that the psycholog - ical , biographical novel is not wanting in construc - tion , though its construction may differ from tha.t of the novel wherein the hero and heroine , each un - mistakably labeled , meet in the first chapter and are married in the last .

		Our new wine must have new bottles .

		The only question to be asked con - cerning form is whether it is an appropriate vehicle for the substance which it embodies .

		In its war against romanticism as a literary method , realism by no means disdains genuine ro - mance .

		It is concerned only to draw the line very sharply between romance and sentimentality .

		Ro - mance may represent a great truth .

		Certainly ro - mantic elements in life and feeling are facts to be recognized like all other facts , and as such are to be reckoned with , not denied , in any veritable pre - sentment of life .

		It is only when romance is set up as somehow above reality instead of a part of it , that it becomes dangerous .

		Sentimentality , the imitation of an emotion for the sake of following convention or of pointing a moral , is a foe to all originality and sincerity in art .

		The trouble with the romantic method is , that it has set up a hieroglyphic system of `` proper '' feelings and situations which have no relation to life and are useless as interpretation , guide , inspiration , or description .

		The new realism , then , is opposed to falsification of the outward or inner semblance of things , for the THE DIAL 637 sake of symbolism or beauty or morality or for any purpose whatsoever .

		Reality never looks the same to two different people .

		It is incumbent on the artist only to present the truth as it presents itself to him .

		The new realism is also opposed to the sub - ordination of presentation to propaganda .

		Truth for truth 's sake , might be its slogan .

		Life is its own exceeding justification .

		To reveal humanity to it - self is the function of the artist .


Shaw	ORGANIZATION	, who hates romanticism as stanchly as any man now living , falls short of being a realist because he never im - merses himself in his characters , is never interested in them for their own sakes , never forgets that he is a preacher .

		There is a high place for preachers ; only it should be remembered that it is never the same place as that occupied by the artists .

		The preacher always wants to do something to reality ; he cares less about understanding it than about push - ing it along in the direction he wants it to pursue .

		It is the mission of the realist to comprehend , not to judge .

		Finally , the new realism is a foe to vagueness .

		There is no such thing as seeing too clearly , it holds .

		Vagueness in expression is only a cloak for vagueness of conception ; and vagueness of concep - tion is only a cloak for laziness .

		The reader or the writer who maintains that clarity dissipates his enjoyment is either too cowardly or too indolent to face the difficulties of precision .

		The whole mission of art is to transcribe impres - sions sensuous , mental , or emotional .

		In this sense accuracy is the final test of style ; if a style is such that it can recapture a fleeting mood , the whisking tail of a scampering feeling , the aspiration which is by common mortals indefinable , it is after all simply an accurate style .

		If it transcribes beauty so that we see and feel beauty as the writer saw and felt it , glorying in all the most glowing colors of diction for the purpose , the highest which it can attain is an accurate presentment of that beauty .

		If this seem like dragging the miracle of art into the light of common day why , common day , though greatly maligned , remains the best light for seeing things .

		The attainment of realism may be expressed in
Carlyle	LOCATION	's fine phrase : `` Finding the ideal in the actual . ''

		Do we thus steal the thunder - of the pro- fessed idealists ?

		But the idealists , the mystics , and the symbolists insist that the actual is the one place where their ideal can not possibly find abiding place .

		It can be found , say they , only in Maeterlinckian grottos or Dunsany temples never in the
Bronx	LOCATION	nor along the Main Street of
Keokuk	LOCATION	,
Iowa	LOCATION	.

		The early `` laboratory '' realists may indeed have denied the ideal elements of life , fleeing like hermits from the sins of the sentiment-ridden world .

		But their modern descendants , so far from reducing life to its physical elements , write whole plays about justice , whole trilogies about the struggle of a man and a woman to wrest the divine , romantic meaning out of the dusty business of printshop and boarding house and matrimony .

		So far from being pessi - mistic , such work gives us the only hope that glory may shine over life as we have to live it , that we , in the integrity of our personalities , are , if
Bennett	PERSON	or
Galsworthy	PERSON	or

HELEN HOYT	PERSON	.

		6 3 8 THE DIAL
June 28	DATE	The Voyages of Conrad IN
1873	DATE	, A POLISH LAD of fifteen , walking in the Alps with his tutor , dismayed that gentleman by a declaration of independence .

		He proposed to give up his country and career , in order to take his chances on the sea .

		A few years later he was sail - ing on the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	, that '' nursery of the craft . ''

		Then he realized his dream by becoming associated with the English flag incidentally learn - ing the English language .

		He went on far voyages , seeing little of
Europe	LOCATION	for a quarter of a century .

		Finally , he accomplished his second transformation : the Polish lad became a great writer of English .

		The boy was named
Jozef Korzeniowski	PERSON	the writer is known to fame as
Joseph Conrad	PERSON	.

		The adventurous spirit thus manifest is charac - teristic of
Conrad	ORGANIZATION	's mind and work .

		Romance is his great word , genuinely romantic are his favorite heroes .

		He arrays them against the manifold visage and challenge of the seven seas .

		He is primarily the psychologist of mariners , he is
Henry James	PERSON	on a
South Sea Island	LOCATION	.

		Let us follow some of his rovings .

		The real voy - ages of
Jozef Korzeniowski	PERSON	concern us only as a basis for the fictional adventures that his double ,
Conrad	PERSON	, has narrated .

		We know that a dozen ac - tual ships and scenes served as a springboard for his imagination .

		The publishers of his tales have recently charted for us the voyages undertaken by his dream-ships in seas that often Conrad alone has adequately celebrated .

		We will cruise with these ships , not in chronological order , but widening out from the author 's favorite center .

		Usually his ports of call are found in Malaysian waters and his ordin - ary beat is that of his hero , Heyst '' a circle with a radius of eight hundred miles drawn round a point in
North Borneo	LOCATION	. ''

		This point is approxi - mately the scene of
Almayer 's Folly	ORGANIZATION	, with which book we begin to cruise .

		The original of Alrnayer , inadequate and shift - less dreamer , had been studied along the muddy banks of the
Pantai	LOCATION	, where the story unrolls .

		The breath of this poisonous backwater eats into the characters and the sunset gold of the Pantai sym - bolizes the vain greed of Almayer .

		Swathed in mist , the river hides a pair of lovers and their canoe ; it is a sleeping world , wherein all the ardent life of the tropics is transferred to the beating hearts of
Dain	ORGANIZATION	and
Nina	PERSON	.

		Finally and this is the actual voyage
Almayer	PERSON	watches his daughter and her lover depart in a violent brazen light ; he watches the vanishing canoe that holds their embracing figures , and he dies in his curses , unforgiving and abandoned .

		The ardor and chivalry of the Malays , their pas - sionate pride , again fascinates
Conrad	ORGANIZATION	in
Karain	LOCATION	.

		Our circle now widens out to include the
Archi	LOCATION	- pelago around
Borneo	LOCATION	.

		Karairt 's mad avenging journey , as he tells it , proceeds from the monster - shaped Celebes , past '' a great mountain burning in the midst of water , '' past myriad islands that are scattered like shards from the gun of a demiurge , to
Java	LOCATION	, with its stone campongs and its slavish population .

		Then on to unhealthy
Delli	LOCATION	, where a blossoming thicket hid
Karain	LOCATION	and his brother-in - arms , the two avengers ; and there the deluded Malay kills his friend instead of the too ravishing woman who should have been the victim .

		This is an intensely tragic voyage .

		The more epic and comic Typhoon is a tale of endurance and conquest .

		Reaching beyond
the Philippines	LOCATION	, its scene is laid near the northernmost point of the Malaysian circle .

		In the narrow dangerous
China	LOCATION	seas , near
Formosa	ORGANIZATION	, the Nan-Shan encountered one of the worst storms ever recorded .

		She was saved by the dullness and obstinacy of her
Captain Mac	ORGANIZATION	- Whirr , a man ; witness his name of no imagina - tion .

		Just as his stupid dutiful letters home are barely read by a yawning family , so does his imper - viousness disgust
Jukes	PERSON	, the livelier chief mate .

		_
MacWhirr	ORGANIZATION	has never yet been in a great storm , but you feel that , as a crustacean , he is prepared for one .

		He greets the danger-signals with the obvious re - mark that there must be '' some dirty weather knock - ing about . ''

		It becomes a Typhoon and knocks everybody about : the officers scurrying on their du - ties from pillar to post ; the cargo , namely two hun - dred coolies , who presently begin sliding to and fro in a mass of boxes , pigtails , and dollars .

		They are roped in like an unruly herd .

		Jukes plunges down to the engine-room and from that gleaming Inferno the boat seems submerged by the greatest blow yet ; tons of water descend , sufficient to wipe out everything ; those in the engine-room stare at one another aghast ; and through the speaking-tube the captain 's voice goes on unperturbed , attending strictly to business .

		When the Nan-Shan was virtually a wreck and the wind fell , they were caught in the circular whirl of the hurricane ; but the captain and the boat kept their heads up and came to anchorage , to the aston - ishment of
Jukes	PERSON	, the reader , and all the seamen in the harbor .

		Mrs.
MacWhirr	PERSON	, in a far-off , forty -
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 639 pound house , stifled a yawn at the captain 's dull account of his voyage .

		On the other side of the
Archipelago	LOCATION	are the peregrinations told of in The End of the Tether .

		The blind Captain
Whalley	PERSON	touches bottom as mate of the coasting craft
Sofala	LOCATION	, which Jbeats up and down its sixteen-hundred-mile circular route through the
Malacca	LOCATION	Straits .

		Needing the money for his daughter , Captain
Whalley	PERSON	has descended to this from much greater voyages .

		To hold his posi - tion , he has concealed his oncoming blindness , de - pending on the eyes of his faithful Malay serang .

		But he is suspected by his worthless officers , one of whom , near
Pangu Bay	LOCATION	, piles the steamer up on the reef and the captain will not survive his charge .

		Such is the third journey in
Conrad	LOCATION	's chief volume of nouvelles .

		The others of the trilogy are
Youth and Heart of Darkness	ORGANIZATION	, both of which are reminis - cences .

		Who has not read Youth , that record of gallantry , endurance , romance , and humor ?

		It tells of
Marlow	ORGANIZATION	's very first voyage , beginning far out of our circle , but aiming for the '' white '' of it , for that
Bangkok	LOCATION	which is the scene of
Falk	PERSON	and from which
Conrad	ORGANIZATION	's own first command set sail .

		Mar - low 's boat was the
Judea	LOCATION	'' all rust , dust , grime soot aloft , dirt on deck . ''

		But on her stern she bore the imperative and romantic motto '' Do or Die . ''

		And
Bangkok	LOCATION	for
Marlow	PERSON	promised all the thrill and wonder of the unknown East .

		Bound first for an English port to load on with coal , the
Judea	LOCATION	spent a week in getting to the Yar - mouth Roads .

		There was a gale ; she shifted bal - last ; the crew were set to the `` grave-diggers ' work '' of righting her .

		After long delay in loading , she had a collision with a steamer , and waited three weeks more .

		Another gale , 300 miles W. of the Lizards , tore up the old ship and the crew turned to endless pumping .

		But still the battered craft threw out '' like an appeal , like a defiance , like a cry to the clouds without mercy , the words written on her stern : '
Judea	LOCATION	,
London	LOCATION	.

		Do or Die . ' ''

		And for
Marlow	ORGANIZATION	, aetat .

		20 , the faith , the endeavor , the imagination of Youth were in that cry .

		Their deck-house was blown away and they put back to
Falmouth	LOCATION	.

		Three times they put back to
Falmouth	LOCATION	.

		The crew refused , and no wonder , to trust that leaky and bewitched hooker , now six months on the road to
Bangkok	LOCATION	and not yet clear of
England	LOCATION	.

		You ask if they ever reached Bang - kok ?

		Almost .

		They finally got to the Indian Ocean , they neared
Java	LOCATION	Head when the coal caught fire .

		Still sailing for
Bangkok	LOCATION	, '' Do or Die , '' they fought that fire for days and just as they seemed to conquer it , the cargo blew up .

		The ship herself blew up , after a steamer had taken the wreck in tow .

		But the crew had saved all they could , and
Marlow	PERSON	, in charge of his own boat , presently sighted
Java	LOCATION	his first vision of the East , '' the East of the ancient narrators , mysterious , re - splendent , and somber . ''

		The
Judea	LOCATION	did and died ; her second mate had begun to live .

		From the year of grace
1900	DATE	dates the personal history of Lord
Jim	PERSON	and the record of the pilgrim - ship , the
Patna	LOCATION	.

		She was a rusty lean cosmopolite , who at some
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	port took on her cargo of eight hundred faithful ignorant cattle-like pilgrims .

		Her officers , barring the untried
Jim	PERSON	, were all scamps and bullies .

		Unlike the men of the
Judea	LOCATION	and the Nan-Shan , these fellows are not true seamen ; and that , with
Conrad	PERSON	, always spells disaster .

		His picture of .

		the early part of the voyage is one oL his greatest pieces of descriptive writing .

		After clearing the
Strait	LOCATION	, the
Patna	LOCATION	headed through the '' one-degree '' passage for the Red Sea , borne down by an oppressive sun , sailing on a stagnant ocean .

		Under a slender shaving of a moon , not far from where the Arabian Sea joins the Red , something happened . '

		A collision with a derelict shook the ship and the souls upon her .

		The scared officers , believing her about to sink , took to the boats , aban - doned the
Patna	LOCATION	and her pil-grims .

		In the record , shifted and twisted from a dozen angles , we feel all of human dread and cowardice , all of human pity for the doomed eight hundred , who yet were not doomed but successfully towed by a French gunboat into
Aden	LOCATION	.

		The
Patna	LOCATION	was saved .

		Only her officers were damned .

		The rest of the story , dealing with the '' case '' of
Jim	PERSON	; his wanderings like those of the accursed Jew , his atone - ment in savage Patusan , will concern us later .

		In a previous voyage , described in The Nigger of the Narcissus we meet with foul weather off the
Cape	LOCATION	and with that admirable cook , who at the height of the storm accomplishes the miracle of making coffee .

		His declaration '' as long as she swims I will cook '' becomes the motto of the desper - ate and dauntless boat .

		For here we are in the presence of `` the dumb courage of men obscure , for - getful , and enduring . ''

		Throughout the windings of their limited and superstitious souls there has passed the taut shiver x > f responsibility , of '' Do or Die . ''

		The Narcissus is no
Patna	LOCATION	.

		It is with ad - miration and fellowship that Conrad bids these sea - men farewell .

		It has been said that this story best '' conjures up the actual spirit of a voyage , '' the smell of the ocean , the ship moving through the tropical heat .

		.

		We have already twice swung around the
Cape	LOCATION	in
Conrad	LOCATION	's wake ; his farther reaches take us into the penetralia of the
West African Coast	LOCATION	.

		As a 640 THE DIAL
June 28	DATE	boy he had dreamed of the dark and dreadful
Congo	LOCATION	.

		In the incomparable
Heart of Darkness	ORGANIZATION	, under the witching spell of the narrator
Marlow	PERSON	, we are taken far up this river , which , resembling an '' immense snake uncoiled , '' buries its tail in the tenebrous wilderness .


Kurtz	PERSON	, that leader of men , has lost both his moral sense and his life .

		An expedition has been sent to pluck him out .

		The steamboat crawled along the gloomy silent
Congo	LOCATION	; it was `` like trav - eling back to the earliest beginnings of the world , when the big trees were kings . ''

		An uncertain channel , a sluggish atmosphere , wonderfully con -- veyed in the telling , saurians on sandbanks , and especially the `` stillness of an implacable force , venge - fully watching . ''

		It had watched poor
Kurtz	PERSON	to some purpose , for when , after experiences with cannibals , ivory , attacks from the jungle when you , I , and
Marlow	PERSON	reach the heart of darkness , we find that its powers have driven
Kurtz	PERSON	to head - hunting , megalomania , and the point of death .

		Far-flung tangents from the circle are traced by other voyages which may be briefly summarized .

		There is the transatlantic venture by which the hero of Romance comes to peril and thirst and the most adorable of stately senoritas on the Spanish Main .

		There is the savage brute of a boat -LRB-
Sydney	LOCATION	to
London	LOCATION	-RRB- which slays a passenger every trip and whose cruel anchor catches up and crushes the mate 's sweatheart before his eyes .

		There is the
Ferndale	LOCATION	-LRB-
London	LOCATION	to
Port Elizabeth	LOCATION	-RRB- , on which occurs the singular incident narrated in that ob - scure book , Chance .

		If Victory has most of
Stev	PERSON	- enson in its scheme , Chance has most of
Henry James	ORGANIZATION	in its method .

		Gradually Conrad has be - come more interested in souls than in ships ; also he stays longer and more persuasively in the society of women .

		That brings us to his inland voyages , which are of two kinds , geographical and psychological .

		As regards the first kind , for over twenty years Conrad scarcely saw the continent of
Europe	LOCATION	, and the jour - neyings which traverse that continent such tales as Under Western Eyes are to my thinking almost negligible .

		But the voyages of discovery into the varieties of human hearts and situations demand fuller treatment .

		They demand first of all some reckoning with the author 's philosophy .

		Traveling always from one place to another , shifting imaginatively from standpoint to stand - point ,
Conrad	PERSON	has naturally come to view life as a great panorama , and art as an adventurous cruise .

		Life is a succession of scenes and the '' master of the show '' is the goddess
Maia	PERSON	.

		Illusion is the word most frequently on
Conrad	ORGANIZATION	's lips illusions of youth , of hope , in fact the '' darkness of a world of illusions '' in which his best-beloved romantic characters appear as beautiful vanishing figure - heads .

		Sombre and splendid , they come , they flash , they go . ''

		Ports are no good , ships rot , men go to the devil . ''

		Conrad 's pessimism becomes more sar - donic and matter-of-fact in his later books .

		But throughout he is saved by his absolute love of the sea and seamen , and by his belief in a certain steadiness and sturdiness which is essentially nauti - cal .

		We have seen how he displays courage and character in his best sailors .

		Again , the artistic compass by which he steers swings resolutely to the pole of Truth .

		Sincerity and ~ a kind of austere control guide this romantic realist who can on the one hand define literary criticism as a high adven - ture of personality exactly like
Anatole France	LOCATION	and on the other achieve restraint in the deepest emotion of Lord
Jim	PERSON	or
Lena	PERSON	.

		Conrad is professedly not '' literary '' in the spe - cial sense .

		He lived only for the sea and did not write a line until his thirty-sixth year .

		It is nat - ural then that the sea 's rhythm should be found in his sentences , something of her swift fickleness in his restless eye .

		He has often compared artistic creation to voyaging .

		Each effort is like the '' everlasting somber stress of the winter passage around
Cape Horn	LOCATION	. ''

		Each story gets under way as leisurely as the
Judea	LOCATION	.

		There are voyages into the consciousness of a hundred heroes , into the thwarted spirit of
Kurtz	PERSON	, into the self-deception of the Nigger , a voyage of discovery to learn simply that Captain
Whalley	PERSON	is blind , another outward tragedy that ends in inner Victory .

		From this mental and moral Odyssey I will detail only a few episodes , which will likewise serve as specimens of
Conrad	ORGANIZATION	's constructive technique .

		There are two main sorts : the voyage that flits from one interest , group , or situation to another , using each cursorily as a port of call ; the voyage which proceeds from one psychological standpoint to another , plumbing the depths of each soul , through its own narrative and confession .

		Of the first kind , the epic story of Nostromo regarded by some as
Conrad	ORGANIZATION	's greatest is typical .

		We know the immense labor that went into this presentation -LRB- based on almost no experience -RRB- of a South American republic .

		The result , I believe , is a tangle , a too intricate web .

		The adventurous interest is to find the pattern , which is not zero as in musical comedy , but nearer infinity , as in
Balzac	LOCATION	.

		In fact ,
Balzac	ORGANIZATION	's method rules .

		From an initial situation , in medias res , we travel back to one set of people and then to another , with fresh digres - sions and dossiers , eddies and whirlpools .

		We sink into the maelstrom of an individual experience
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 641 to emerge into the muddy froth of revolutionary parties .

		We are led astray by an undated log-book , which produces much confusion of time and place .

		We are frustrated by unclear sequences and con - trary winds and we chart our course in a dozen directions .

		To this excessive ramble one is justified in pre - ferring the stiller depths of Lord
Jim	PERSON	.

		Here Con - rad nearly attains his desired unity of effect , the atmospheric steeping which is the essence of his romanticism .

		Here , at least , there is a single sub - ject , a mountain of a subject , which we cruise around and see through the eyes of several ob - servers .

		The author uses his pet device of first - person narration .

		The reminiscent and gloomy
Marlow	PERSON	first appears here and tells us , too length - ily , nearly the whole story of
Jim	PERSON	's failure and re - habilitation .

		But that is only one point of view .

		There is also the inner circle of
Jim	PERSON	's own con - sciousness , gradually becoming distinct .

		There are the successive sidelights thrown episodically by the self-sufficient
Brierly	PERSON	, by the French captain , with his touchstone of honor , by the merchant who re - trieves and establishes Jim in
Patusan	LOCATION	.

		There are the crowning lights thrown by
Jim	PERSON	's dusky sweet - heart and his chivalrous brother-in-arms spot - lights for the catastrophe .

		Here again space and time are introverted or confused , but the main end is gained and we have a progressively ascending study of one temperament mirrored through several others ... In Chance , these others are quite evidently of the sort usually chosen by
Henry James	PERSON	: the first-person narrator , curious but limited in knowledge , the dull conven - tional couple who guard the unfortunate heroine , the viewpoint of the romantic captain who weds and saves her .

		But it is in Victory that we find the happiest amalgamation of the true Conrad with his cosmo - politan masters for certainly his technique is much more exotic than English .

		With Victory we are in the heart of
Malaysia	LOCATION	again and we are furthermore in the hearts of the various actors in this passionate drama .

		The magnanimous self-tormented Heyst is set off against the cupidity and villainies of old
Schomberg	PERSON	,
Ricardo	PERSON	, and '' plain Mr.
Jones	PERSON	. ''

		With most of these we stay for several chapters , while each expounds his attitude and outlook .

		They are loosely enclosed within two outer rings of observa - tion , that of the semi-detached narrator and of the peripatetic Captain
Davidson	PERSON	, who brings news of Heyst and the girl on the island .

		The triumph of the .

		book is the girl herself , her gradual rise from a dull sulkiness Conrad is strangely fond of sulky women to participation in
Heyst	LOCATION	's scheme for her rescue , and finally to an overwhelming gratitude reaching the point of self-immolation .

		Her growth in consciousness and effectiveness is a marvel of psychological portrayal , set amid stirring deeds .

		The Spanish heroine of the Arrow of Gold -LRB- Double - day , Page ;
1919	DATE	-RRB- is , on the other hand , already fully grown ; almost as grown as her creator , in her strange mingling of deep romance and disillusionment .

		e Mr.
Richard Curie	PERSON	,
Conrad	ORGANIZATION	's biographer and critic , has found over ninety strongly realized char - acters in his work .

		What a power of vision is needed to conceive sharply all these diverse types !

		The creative mind has roamed from the duellist
Feraud	ORGANIZATION	, of
Napoleon	PERSON	's time , to the chivalrous dark - skinned Dain , from caged and restless English girls -LRB-
Bessie Carvil	PERSON	,
Flora de Barral	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- to the romantic Ninas and Seraphinas of exotic strain .

		Literally from
China	LOCATION	to
Peru Conrad	LOCATION	has voyaged and ob - served .

		He has depicted vast rivers and '' those seas of God '' in all their myriad changes sunny smiles hurrying into darkness , sluggish peace alter - nating with riot and cruelty .

		Much has he trav - eled in the realms of gold so much that the de - ferent reviewer can see only two more major ad - ventures for him to undertake .

		The first would be to visit this country , as he once proposed to do .

		May he long delay the great Departure , the uncertain landfall of the second voyage !

		E.
PRESTON DARGAN	PERSON	.

		A Parasite Novel T J-H .

		HE REALTY OF CHARACTERS in fiction depends on a multitude of adventitious circumstances .

		We believe in a man because he lives in a known town , on a particular street , at a special number ; because he belongs to a certain religious sect or political party ; because he dresses in conventional black or in sport tweeds ; because he has a squint , a wen , a stam - mer , or smells of garlic .

		One of the methods of the realist is the identification of characters by families ; and since family is so important ' an in - stitution to the English , we should expect to find that method greatly in vogue in the English novel .

		Thackeray as an English gentleman recognizes his characters by their family connections , and one of the ways in which he makes his whole social fabric convincing is by carrying his families on from novel THE DIAL
June 28	DATE	to novel .

		A modern edition of
Thackeray	PERSON	's novels should be furnished with a series of genealogical trees , as
Hardy	LOCATION	's with a map of
Wessex	ORGANIZATION	.

		In The Gay-Dombeys -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Sir
Harry Johnston	PERSON	has reared a family structure of his own on a foundation established for him by a famous predecessor .

		Dombey and Son was the novel in which
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	dealt most specifically with the theme of family and the curse of family pride , so properly punished in the misfortune of the senior Dombey the flight of his wife , the death of his son , the down -
fall	DATE	of his house .

		Now comes Sir
Harry Johnston	PERSON	to show us the family revived through the marriage of
Florence Dombey	LOCATION	to
Walter Gay	PERSON	, whose name yields through hyphenization to hers , so that the son and heir of the house is
Paul Dombey III	PERSON	.

		And accompanying the Dombeys into the second and third generations there is a similar projection of their com - patriots in the world of
Dickens	LOCATION	.

		Suzanne , daughter of Sir
Walter Gay-Dombey	PERSON	and
Florence	LOCATION	, is married to a Lord Feenix .


Harriet Carker	PERSON	's son ,
Eustace Morven	PERSON	, a faithful retainer of the house of
Dombey	LOCATION	, is the hero of the book .

		His inspiration comes to him from Professor Lacrevy , F.R.S. , whose sister ,
Adele	LOCATION	, is his first love .

		The Toodles stock has borne a railway promoter ; Sir
James Tudell	PERSON	, a popular actress ,
Bella Delorme	PERSON	, and a blackleg journalist ,
Baxendale Strangeways	LOCATION	.

		There is also a Sir Mul - berry Hawk , a Barnet Skettles , and a Lord
Algernon Verisopht	PERSON	.

		These people start thus with a certain inherited reality which is increased by a resemblance in character or position to personalities of the day .

		That of
Josiah Choselwhit	PERSON	to
Joseph Chamberlain	PERSON	, and of
Lord Wiltshire	LOCATION	to
Lord Salisbury	LOCATION	, are most noteworthy .

		For the rest Sir
Harry	PERSON	creates his human background from the world which he has known , the late Victorian .

		At Sir
Walter	PERSON	's party , with which the tale opens in
1887	DATE	, the characters above noted are set off by a background consisting of the Bancrofts ,
Henry Irving	PERSON	,
John Hare	PERSON	,
George Grossmith	PERSON	,
Eric Lewis	PERSON	- ,
Beerbohm Tree	ORGANIZATION	,
Ellen Terry	PERSON	,
Arthur Pinero	PERSON	, several Rothschilds and Ox - ford Dons ,
Arthur Balfour	PERSON	-LRB- who talked theology with Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	-RRB- ,
W. S. Gilbert	PERSON	,
Arthur Sullivan	PERSON	-LRB- who played the accompaniment for An - toinette Stirling to sing The Lost Chord , DuMau - rier ,
Margot Tennant	PERSON	-LRB- Dodo -RRB- ,
Corney Grain	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- who delighted everyone with his parodies -RRB- , and
Oscar Wilde	PERSON	-LRB- who shocked them with his epigrams -RRB- .

		Al - together an easy way to get the human stuff for a novel .

		Why is it not done oftener ?

		The method of the story is equally nonchalant .

		It follows for a main thread the biography of
Sir Eustace Morven	ORGANIZATION	explorer , consul , commissioner with governing power in tropical
Africa	LOCATION	.

		The im - plication that the book is based on the documents of Sir
Eustace	PERSON	gives plausibility to the African ma - terial , for which Sir
Harry Johnston	PERSON	's own career is ample authority .

		The second episode of the book in interest , and the first in dramatic handling , is the love affair of
Paul Dombey	PERSON	II L And for back - ground there are English politics and administration represented by the Feenixes ,
Skettles	PERSON	, and
Mulberry Hawks	ORGANIZATION	, the imperial inefficiency against which Sir
Eustace	PERSON	breaks his life ; there is English society at Sir
Walter Gay-Dombey	PERSON	's house in
Onslow Square	LOCATION	or at
Lord Wiltshire	LOCATION	's or Lord Feenix 's country houses , with its imperial cynicism ; there is English religion represented by the orthodoxy of solemn
Canon S. Edward Dombey	ORGANIZATION	, and the superstition of the
Second Advent	ORGANIZATION	held strongly by
Eustace	ORGANIZATION	's mother ; the English stage represented by Belle De - lorme ; English journalism by
Baxendale Strange	ORGANIZATION	- ways ; and English art by the estheticism of-Percival and
Lucretia Dombey	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is all the substance of ex - perience and observation , a journalistic record of certain aspects and episodes in imperial
England	LOCATION	put forward casually and unpremeditatedly , much of it in letters , the rest in dialogues , conversations , and author 's narrative , and properly introduced by the foremost practitioner of the English journalistic novel , - Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	.

		Perhaps the chief challenge of the title is to our recognition of the changes which have passed over English life as recorded in fiction in the half-century interval between Dombey and Son and The Gay - Dombeys .

		One difference has already been noted , the greater emphasis on the background , and its con - nection with greater issues , political and social .

		A second difference is the greater uniformity of charac - ter , the absence of startling eccentricity in life and grotesque exaggeration in the drawing of it .

		But the chief difference is undoubtedly in the moral cli - mate of the two books .

		Both contain the element of illicit love ; but while
Edith Dombey	PERSON	's flight is heav - ily weighted with moral significance , the escapade of
Paul Dombey III	PERSON	and
Lucilla Smith	PERSON	is totally with - out moral implication , the whole question being one of beating the social game .

		The Victorians used passion as an opportunity for renunciation , and that Mr.
Dombey	PERSON	is excluded from the benefit of this unearned moral increment shows the depth of his reprobation .

		The post - Victorians -LRB- vide Wells ,
Beresford	LOCATION	,
George	PERSON	-RRB- , like the comedians of the Restoration , use it as a test point in the contest be - tween man and his environment .

		Their theme is not the spiritual reward of sacrifice but the social difficulty of '' getting away with it . ''

		Sir
Harry Johnston	PERSON	is of their school of thought .

		ROBERT
MORSS LOVETT	ORGANIZATION	.

		1919 THE DIAL 643 Feodar Sologub I CAN NOT give you my autobiography , ''
Sologub	PERSON	wrote the editor of a literary almanac , `` as I do not think that my personality can be of sufficient interest to anyone . ''

		And so we know nothing of the man
Feodar Teternikov	PERSON	beyond the fact of his birth in
1864	DATE	, his education in
Petrograd	LOCATION	, and his early vocation as a schoolmaster .

		But of the writer
Feodar Sologub	PERSON	, the egohood of Teternikov , we have the testimony of more than twenty volumes .

		Of this work he himself states : '' I simply and calmly reveal my soul ... in the hope that the intimate part of me shall become the universal . ''

		Which irrelevantly suggests a very placid child seated on the nursery floor and solemnly exhibiting his glow - ing , variegated , shifting kaleidoscope .

		Unfortunately only four books from this extensive self-revelation are available for English readers : The Little Demon -LRB- translated by
John Cournos	PERSON	and
Richard Aldington	PERSON	; Knopf ,
1916	DATE	-RRB- and The Created Legend -LRB- translated by
John Cournos	PERSON	;
Stokes , Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
1916	DATE	-RRB- , which have been termed the In - ferno and Paradise of Russian literature , The Sweet Scented Name -LRB- edited by
Stephen Graham	PERSON	; Putnam ,
1916	DATE	-RRB- , and The Old House -LRB- translated by
John Cournos	PERSON	;
Knopf	ORGANIZATION	,
1916	DATE	-RRB- .

		Of these two are novels , two are collections of short stories , all are philosophic in tone and symbolic in method .

		The Little Demon is the depiction of an idea , built up incident by incident like the values of a painting gray values transepted by a single streak of carmen , the adolescent love of Liudmilla and the student
Sasha	PERSON	.

		It is an idea of evil , resulting from the distortion of life by the light of a corrupt imag - ination .

		Peredonov , a schoolmaster , lives with his cousin
Varvara Dmitrievna	PERSON	in the little town of Skorodozh .

		His mistress has promised that if he will marry her , she will use her influence with the princess for whom she formerly worked to have ` him made an inspector .

		On this slight peg of the coveted inspectorship hangs all the drab , noisome fabric of the tale .

		His passion to attain it makes Peredonov suspicious .

		He is suspicious of
Varvara	PERSON	till he smells his coffee to make sure she has not poisoned it ; of his friends till he protests his inno - cence to leading townsmen to circumvent imagined slander ; of the princess , whom he insanely suspects of wishing to seduce him , till the thought of `` the al - most cold little old woman smelling slightly of a corpse '' makes him faint with savage voluptuousness and drives him to sending her an obscene note that thwarts all his hopes of promotion ; of the cat , which looks at him wildly and snarls till he tries , by shear - ing her , to rid himself of the menace in the elec - tricity of her fur ; of the playing cards , which seem to whisper and leer at him till he pokes out their eyes ; and finally , above all , he is suspicious of the ramlike
Volodin	PERSON	, an old friend whom he holds senselessly as an enemy and whom in a frenzy of insanity and drunkenness he eventually kills .

		From the first adagio , where he .

		smells his coffee , andante through his mistaking the pond for a dirty mirror , or setting fire to the dining room because of a gray imp running up the curtains , to the fanfare of the murder , the incidents blend in a crescendo of mad - ness , the madness resulting from an inherently warped , malevolent point of view .

		It is the man 's own nature which haunts him in the form of the little demon '' a small , gray and nimble nedoti - komka '' that nods and trembles and circles around him and , when he stretches out his hand to catch it , glides swiftly out of sight , only to reappear a moment later trembling and mocking again .

		Vindictive , carnal , insane , '' colgssal in his petti - ness , '' Peredonov is nevertheless a tragic figure .

		Because he is acute enough to realize evil in him - self and others , he throws his whole life on the fires of his bitterness ; then dances like a maniac by the light of the holocaust .

		Within and without the stuff of ; his world is hate , and there he stands alone , with only the consciousness of his corruption .

		In the midst of the depression of these streets and houses under estranged skies , upon the unclean and im - potent earth , walked Peredonov tormented by confused fears .

		There was no comfort for him in the heights and no consolation upon the earth , because now , as before , he looked upon the world with dead eyes like some demon who , in his dismal loneliness , despaired with fear and with yearning ... All that reached his consciousness became transformed into abomination and filth .

		All ob - jects revealed their imperfections to him and their imper - fections gave him pleasure .

		When he walked past an erect clean column , he had a desire to make it crooked and to bespatter it with filth ... There were neither beloved objects for him nor beloved people and this made it possible for nature to act upon his feelings only one - sidedly , as an irritant .

		Yet amid the phantoms illumined by his own infernal imagination , his perishing soul can still murmur wistfully : '' Surely everything does n't merely seem to me .

		There must be also truth upon the earth . ''

		The keynote of The Little Demon is individual - ism , that of an extreme egotist cut off from his kind .

		The Created Legend , on the contrary , is essen - tially social . ''

		I love the people , I love freedom , '' cries the heroine Elisaveta .

		`` My love is revolt . ''

		644 THE DIAL
June 28	DATE	In the latter work we see distinctly the advan - tages and disadvantages of the author 's stated formula : '' I take a piece of life coarse and poor and make of it a delightful legend . ''

		The piece of life here is the story of the poet and chemist
Trirodov	PERSON	, who establishes an out-of-door school for children beyond the confines of
Skorodozh	LOCATION	, in which , as we may remember , dwells also Peredonov .

		But where we formerly looked at the village through the black glasses of egotism , we now see it through the rose of altruism .

		Barefooted children and in - structresses lightly clad in gay colors , romp through the glades of
Trirodov	ORGANIZATION	's property , where by chance comes
Elisaveta	PERSON	, daughter of a nearby landowner , who loves the poet for his revolutionary and humanitarian views and eventually marries him .

		The legend , in the meantime , makes Elisaveta the reincarnation of the lost queen
Ortruda	PERSON	from beautiful isles in the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	and symbolic also of the
1905	DATE	revolution .

		It peoples the master 's house with white , silent , spiritual children in an - tithesis to the pink , rollicking , fleshly boys and girls of his gardens .

		Throughout its paragraphs magic is rampant : Trirodov changes the former wicked owner into a prism which he keeps on his desk as a paperweight ; strange melodies are heard from far away corridors ; while on St.
John	PERSON	's Eve , putrid ghosts representing the dead institutions of old
Russia	LOCATION	pace the Navii footpath .

		These symbols , according to the author , should be treated like music , which is interpreted differently by each individual : It does not matter that one person understands a story one way and one another ... Do not think that I refrain from explaining ray work because I do not wish to .

		Perhaps I simply can not .

		I was in such a mood and such a poem was the result .

		It may be due , psychologically , to this verbal projection of a mood that the union of fantasy and realism sometimes becomes actually grotesque in
Sologub	LOCATION	's longer works .

		A mood is difficult to sustain in an extensive piece of writing and when it lapses , its expression , is forced or thin .

		A tired mood in an author follows the path of least resist - ance and embodies itself in a trite or inept symbol .

		Moreover , it is too weak to stimulate a like emotion in the reader , and so his attention is left free to notice the mere technique of the uncertain parallel - ism .

		For instance , at the beginning of The Created Legend , in the account of the sisters ' bathing ,
Sologub	PERSON	's mood is one of joy and youth .

		Intense at first , it expresses itself in words whose ease , rhythm , and relevance arouse the same feeling in the reader : It was a bright hot midday in
summer	DATE	and the heavy glances of the flaming
Dragon	ORGANIZATION	fell on the river Skorodyn .

		The water , the light , and the
summer	DATE	beamed and were glad ; they beamed because of the sunlight that filled the immense space , they were glad because of the wind that blew from some far land , because of the many birds , because of the two nude maidens .

		But further , toward the end of the episode , the rnood wanes and the same figure of the sun , because of its forced and discordant quality , becomes ridiculous : They made their way silently together out of the pleasant , cool , deep water toward the dry ground , heaven 's terrestrial footstool , and out into the air , where they met the hot kisses of the slowly , cumberously rising Dragon .

		They stood awhile on the bank yielding them - selves to the
Dragon	ORGANIZATION	's kisses , then entered the protected bath house where they had left their clothes .

		This same involuntary grotesqueness , rather than a perverted mind , is , I believe , the basis of accusa - tions against
Sologub	PERSON	of pornography .

		For instance , descriptions of passion or beauty are frequently marred by suggestions of the most modern or prac - tical things .

		Now just why a heroine of serious verse may ride a horse even astride but never a bicycle , or why combing her hair is a poetic act on the part of the
Loreli	LOCATION	, while brushing her teeth is not , are facts for future doctors ' theses to analyze , yet their status is undisputed .

		Similarly , it is unfortunate when Liudmilla in The Little Demon shows
Sasha	PERSON	the label of
Guerlain	ORGANIZATION	,
Paris	LOCATION	, on a bottle of perfume before scenting him with it ; or when
Trirodov	PERSON	hastens for ` his kodak to photograph the body of his mistress , or presents
Elisaveta	ORGANIZATION	, on their bethothal , with a snapshot of his nude former wife .

		This last may be Slavic , and it may even be symbolic , but at least for any Anglo-Saxon sense of the ridiculous , it is beyond th ^ pale .

		Inconsistency , too , adds to our impression that
Sologub	PERSON	sometimes describes passion for his own sake rather than for the sake of his characters .

		After saying through one of the latter that a free feeling is always innocent , and reiterating that the love of Liudmilla and
Sasha	PERSON	is pure , he nevertheless subjects her to forty or fifty pages of agonized restraint until , with Freudian inevitability , she dreams that she is embraced by a swan .

		This occasional awkwardness of style is entirely lacking in his short stories .

		The
Old House	ORGANIZATION	, for instance , which is the account of a day in the lives of three women the grandmother , mother , and sister of Boris , who has been hung for anarchy , is like a long , prose song .

		It is a song of grief , with the cadence of very simple words , the unity of dawn to dark , and the slow rhythm of the sun 's arc across the sky : When the midday sun rested overhead , when the sad moon beckoned , when the rosy dawn blew its cool breezes , when the evening sun blazed its red laughter these were the four points between which their spirits fluctuated from evening joy to high midday sorrow .

		Swayed involun - tarily , all three of them felt the sympathy and antipathy of the hours , each mood in turn .

		1919 THE DIAL 645 The description of this family grief , which is the motive of the story , shows
Sologub	PERSON	's agreement with the revolution more fervently than do any of his other works , although even these are never free from suggestions of political unrest and intrigue .

		For him , the matter resolves itself into a revolt of youth against the established order of tyranny and op - pression .

		Adult radicalism is generally shown as something ugly , because it has in it the alloy of self-interest and scheming .

		But the rebellion of youth is beautiful because it is magnanimous , im - petuous , and exultantly fearless .

		Not even the waters of all the cold oceans can quench the fire of daring love , and all the cunning poisons of the earth can not poison it .

		`` I love all bigness , all im - moderation in everything !

		In everything ! ''

		Boris cries , and
Natasha	PERSON	answers : '' Yes , big things , things beyond the powers of man .

		To make life lavish .

		Only no stinginess , no trembling for one 's skin .

		Far better to die to gather all life into one little knot and to throw it away ! ''

		The brother 's opportunity comes , and true to faith , he stoutly gathers his young , good life into a single terrible second and flings it to destruction .

		Boris the beloved boy with his fine , honest eyes is hung in the prison courtyard , and thereafter from dawn to dark and from dark to dawn , the tightening of that childish neck and the blackening of that sun - burnt face haunt the impotent minds of those who loved him .

		The other translations are less emotionally partisan , and so , as
Sologub	PERSON	is intellectually too cynical to be a consistent propagandist , they are only indirectly revolutionary .

		The ominous cloud of of - ficial and Cossack tyranny hovers always in the back - ground and even the prophecy and tenets of Bolshe - vism are mentioned .

		Elisaveta dreams of hiding books , ponderous condemned books that are brought to her by students , workmen , young women , school boys , and military men , all of whom whisper per - sistently , `` Hide them , hide them ! ''

		till finally there is no hiding place left and still the books are brought .

		A dull provincial supper party at the Svetilovitches is raided and the hostess and guests unjustly searched .

		Peredonov visits fellow towns - men to protest his loyalty .

		And Cossacks ride abruptly through the park on a
summer	DATE	evening flashing their knouts promiscuously across the shoul - ders of strollers , for no reason except that their leader is drunk .

		In The Created Legend ,
Piotr	PERSON	, looking far ahead with unsuspected clarity , exclaims : There will be a reign of terror and a shaking up such as
Russia	LOCATION	has not yet experienced .

		The point at issue is not that there is talking or doing here or there by certain gentry who imagine that they are making history .

		The real issue is in the clash of two classes , two interests , two cultures , two conceptions of the world , two moral systems .

		Who is it that wishes to seize the crown of lordship ?

		It is the kham -LSB- serf -RSB- .

		It is he who threatens to devour our culture .

		And
Elisaveta	PERSON	responds : I know that we human beings will always be frail , poor , lonely , but a time will surely come when we shall pass through the purifying flame of a great conflagration ; then a new earth and a new heaven shall open up to us ; through union we shall attain our final freedom .

		Brute force is the origin of all ownership , so that the proletariat is justified in reverting to it to turn the tables on the capitalist .

		As in Bolshevism , the immediate aim of the radicals in The Created Legend is public ownership of the machinery of production , including land , which is to be divided into ten or a hundred acre lots for all who wish to farm it .

		Constitutional Democrats merely desire to construct a pyramid out of people ; Social Demo - crats would scatter this pyramid in an even stratum over the earth . ''

		But what of our culture ? ''

		cries
Piotr	PERSON	, and Trirodov answers bitterly : `` The value of human life is greater than the value of these monuments ! ''

		If
Sologub	PERSON	is not a propagandist , neither is he , like
H. G. Wells	PERSON	for instance , a dialectician .

		He is an artist .

		His emotions and the beauty of his ex - pression are more important than his ideas .

		The
Old House	ORGANIZATION	, with the remaining stories of the same volume , and the fairy tales or fables of The Sweet Scented Name prove that at best he can verbally paint a mood more exquisitely than any living Russian .

		His style is simple and very facile , yet his originality always saves it from the triteness of sentimentality .

		Life for him is intense and he de - picts it clearly , with haunting nuances of childish minds , of early
spring	DATE	, of human wistfulness , of vague , disquieting Weltschmerz .

		He has been compared occasionally with other Russian authors who like himself use the form of the short story more frequently and more successfully than another .

		But it is this indefinable longing in
Sologub	LOCATION	and this Slavic consciousness of all humanity which to me relates him most closely with
Dostoevsky	ORGANIZATION	.

		As in all comparisons of writers , there are some super - ficial differences of method between them , and there is likewise a fundamental difference in breadth and intensity of character Dostoevsky being distinctly the bigger man but there is nevertheless and < above all an essential similarity in attitude toward their material life .

		To begin with , both , either through author 's com - ment or in the speeches of principal characters , re - pudiate this same life .

		To
Sologub	PERSON	, reality is tragic and man 's only liberation from it .

		is through his imagination .

		But even this is uncertain , for life 6 4 6 THE DIAL
June 28	DATE	with her pitiless irony destroys all illusions .

		In The Kiss of the Unborn the mother who has killed her baby by abortion is forgiven and blessed in a vision of the child for sparing it the sordid agony of living .

		The white children of
Trirodov	ORGANIZATION	's house represent the fantasies of tiny sufferers escaping the squalor of existence by dreams and make-believes
Dosto	PERSON	- evsky , in the creed of
Ivan Karamazov	PERSON	, rejects hu - man existence even more definitely and emphatically .

		The latter says to Alyosha : I accept God and am glad to , and what 's more I accept His wisdom , His purpose which are utterly be - yond our ken ; I believe in the underlying order and meaning of life ; I believe in the eternal harmony in which they s ~ ay we shall one day be blended ... Yet , would you believe it , in the final result I do n't accept this world of God 's , and , although I know it exists , I do n't accept it at all .

		It 's not that I do not accept God , you must understand , it 's the world created by him I do n't and can not accept .

		Morally too ,
Sologub	PERSON	and Dostoevsky respond un - conditionally and almost in unison to the old ques - tion : Am I my brother 's keeper ?

		The former says : '' The conscience ripened to universal full - ness says that every fault is my fault . ''

		And thus echoes the terrible cry of his predecessor , '' I am responsible to everyone for everything ! ''

		Toward children both authors feel an admiration and love amounting to reverence .

		Sologub holds that only children really live , for children alone are innocent .

		One critic has said that when he loves or pities an older person , he endows him with child - like attributes .

		Many of his children die young to spare them from becoming unlovable .

		Mitya , re - calling his little playmate
Rayechka	PERSON	, observes : `` Had Rayechka lived to grow up , she might have become a housemaid like
Darya	PERSON	, pomaded her hair and squinted her cunning eyes . ''

		In The
Brothers Karamazov	ORGANIZATION	,
Ivan	PERSON	's entire de - nial of life is due to adult cruelty toward children .

		What have these to do with the suffering which shall pay for eternal harmony ?

		Here there can be no solidarity of retribution , because children are blameless of sin .

		Through all eternity , their tears will be unatoned : Imagine that you are creating a fabric of human destiny with the object of making men happy in the end , giving them peace and rest at last , but that it was essen - tial and inevitable to torture to death only one tiny creature ... and to found an edifice on its un - avenged tears , would you consent to be the architect on those conditions ?

		.

		.

		And can you admit the idea that men for whom you are building it would agree to accept their happiness on the foundation of the unexpiated blood of a little victim ?

		And accepting it , would remain happy forever ?

		Then answering his own question ,
Ivan	PERSON	concludes : Why , the whole world of knowledge is not worth the prayer of one child to dear , kind God ... While there is still time , I hasten to protect myself , and so I re - nounce the higher harmony altogether ... I would rather remain with my unavenged suffering and unsatis - fied indignation , even if I were ` wrong . ''

		Both in
Sologub 's Created Legend	ORGANIZATION	and in
Dostoevsky	LOCATION	's Idiot ,
Christ	LOCATION	is represented as a modern character .

		In the first , he is Prince
Davidov	PERSON	, a celebrated author and preacher with a '' tranquil , too tranquil voice '' ; in the second he is Prince
Myshkin	PERSON	, the epileptic hero .

		And strangely enough , although each writer admits the tremendous magnetism and power of Jesus , both agree in ex - cluding him absolutely from truth .

		But here their resemblance ceases , for
Sologub	PERSON	sides with truth ,
Dostoevsky	ORGANIZATION	with Christ .

		Trirodov ,
Solgub	ORGANIZATION	's ideal character , with proud , Satanic irony , we are told , refuses ever to stand with
Davidov	PERSON	.

		He will not accept his comforting theories or listen to his false eloquence which seeks to entice the weak .

		There is no miracle or resurrection , nor has a single will ever established itself over the inert , amorphous world . ''

		I know the true path my path ! ''

		He cries bitterly , `` Leave me alone ! ''

		Dostoevsky , on the contrary , writing his brother , exclaims : `` If anyone can prove to me that
Christ	ORGANIZATION	is outside of truth , and if the truth really does exclude Christ , I should prefer to stay with
Chirst	PERSON	and not with the truth . ''

		And in the passion of these very words he confesses that for him , truth does exclude Christ .

		But truth is merely the laws of nature , while Christ is the great priceless Being , worth the whole earth which nature has aimlessly clutched , crushed , and swallowed up .

		Truth is the created world which
Ivan Karamazov	PERSON	acknowledges but will not accept .

		The man ,
Jesus	LOCATION	, represents all suffering , deluded humanity .

		Finally , categorically both authors are symbolists , but here too , there is an essential difference .

		Sologub 's symbols are numerous hieroglyphs of mood , subject according to himself to the general pictorial interpretation of each reader , while
Dostoevsky	ORGANIZATION	's are rare keys to unlock the very structure itself .

		For instance in The Possessed , un - less we realize from the first that Stavrogin personi - fies will , the book , instead of being a literary master - piece , appears like the irresponsible ravings of a lunatic .

		Then too , as we have seen before ,
Sologub	PERSON	is fundamentally an artist , whereas
Dostoevsky	ORGANIZATION	is a philosopher .

		To the latter , material is paramount ; to the former , emphasis falls on presentation .

		Con - sequently one has vital significance , the other has ethereal charm .

		For the art of
Dostoevsky	ORGANIZATION	is as loose , spacious , and massive as life ; that of
Sologub	PERSON	as vivid , intimate , and frail as a dream .

		KATHERINE
KEITH	PERSON	.

		1919 THE DIAL 647 The Trial of Political Criminals Here and Abroad XOLITICAL CRIME in the
United States	LOCATION	, has been , up till very recently , a rare thing .

		In
Europe	LOCATION	it has been for a long time a well recognized part of life .

		With the European it is almost as familiar as other crime .

		With us it is just beginning to be recognized as a form of crime punished by the statutes .

		Just sb long as thieves , robbers , burglars , and murder - ers were the objects of arrest and trial , the princi - ples of court procedure and the lot of these men in prison were matters which a Howard might in - vestigate , but which appealed little to the ordinary man .

		Now that some of the finer spirits in this country are facing trial and imprisonment in our dungeons , now that the man in the street is begin - ning to be directly affected by the procedure in court and the treatment of the prisoner in prison there is certain to be a creation of interest in both courts and prisons .

		This article will deal only with court procedure , and will use some recent trials , especially in the City of
New York	LOCATION	, to illustrate the principles of present day procedure and to point the moral of a transformed procedure which will more nearly do justice to the individual and to the state .

		Everywhere on the continent of
Europe	LOCATION	the pro- cedure in criminal trials is practically the same .

		In countries where the Anglo-American system prevails we have a striking contrast to the
Continental Eu	ORGANIZATION	- ropean system .

		In
Continental Europe	ORGANIZATION	the jury is judge of the facts and of the law .

		In the
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	- American system the jury is judge of the facts , and the judge , of the law .

		In the first system the jury is tolerant ; in ours intolerant .

		In the
Continental	ORGANIZATION	system the jury is independent and , in some cases , an - tagonistic to the wishes of the judge .

		In ours the jury is submissive and pliant to the judge .

		In the foreign system the defendant is given the last word .

		In ours the prosecution has the last say .

		In the first system the jury gets a complete case gets all the evidence the prosecution and the defense desire '' '' to present .

		In our system the two parties are lim - ited in the presentation of evidence by rules of proof .

		In the foreign system , because of the lack of tech - nical rules , there is little waste of time over quirks and quibbles .

		In our system an infinite amount of time is thrown away by long , tedious , useless dis - cussions of points of law relating to the admission and the exclusion of testimony , or evidence of other sort .

		By means of this system of rules we keep out a great deal of matter the
Continental European	ORGANIZATION	believes essential to the liberty of the citizen .

		A cardinal doctrine there is that the defense is free a formula which is consecrated by centuries of strug - gle by the people against arbitrary power .

		This freedom implies freedom not only for the defendant himself to give evidence as he wishes and in the quantity he desires , but also for the witnesses he may bring forward to prove his case .

		These wit - nesses are free , too .

		They too must be allowed to testify untrammeled by anyone .

		This series of contrasts is long and striking .

		Is justice come to more easily and surely by the Con - tinental European `` than by the Anglo-American method ?

		Centuries of oppression , a contest long drawn out between the rulers and the subjects , have brought the
Continental	ORGANIZATION	Europeans to the sys - tem which in criminal law makes the jury the judge of both the facts and the law .

		Rivers of blood ran before the people conquered the right to be tried by a body of their peers , and not by governmental authorities .

		Even now most judges are not directly elected by the people , but are appointed either by governmental authority which is hereditary or which has been elected by the people .

		The situation is in this last case like that of our Federal judges who are appointed by the President who has been elected by the people .

		Even in the case of the judges ap - pointed by an elected governmental authority the
Continental European	ORGANIZATION	is wary .

		Not that the jury is infallible , or that it is always on the side of the defendant , and particularly in political cases , on the side of the prisoner .

		But the probabilities are that the jury , rather than the judge who is the direct representative of the governing power that brings the prosecution will give the defendant a fairer trial .

		Because of the reasons that have brought to birth the jury of law and of fact the
Continental Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean jury is also tolerant , and independent of the judge and sometimes antagonistic to him .

		A hostile attitude of the judge to the defendant will almost certainly in a political case espe - cially cause a revulsion on the part of the jury an3 result in an acquittal as a demonstra - tion of power .

		In Anglo-American countries , on the other hand , the jury is meek and dependent upon the judge .

		Our system of evidence conduces to that result , and history reinforces the teachings snd the requirements of law .

		Wide differences of opinion have produced a tolerance in
Europe	LOCATION	of which we are not yet the possessors .

		This tolerance finds a prominent place in the jury box across the water , whereas it is almost unknown in this coun - try , except in rare cases and in * the largest cities .

		Minorities are not yet respected here .

		They had a vigorous handling during the Revolution , and a worse handling during the late war .

		648 THE DIAL
June 28	DATE	Attorneys present a spectacle less admirable even than jurors .

		Up to this war no one had dreamed , even in this country , which had had continuously a fairly placid internal history , that lawyers per - sons who had defended criminals of the common crime sort and had even defended murderers of presidents , and had been praised for their action would run away from the defense of political pris - oners .

		But to that we have come .

		Any lawyer who dares to defend such persons is cut and con - demned by members of his profession .

		A great conspiracy of inaction seems to have been entered into , and the distinguished members of that learned profession decline to stir on behalf of a political prisoner , no matter how flimsy the evidence to sup - port the charge .

		In
Europe	LOCATION	the tolerance of the profession and of the people at large gives wide scope to the activities of a lawyer .

		It is considered most honorable to defend a political prisoner , just as it is even still considered in this country in theory at least , for distinguished counsel are no longer to be seen in criminal courts honorable to the law and to the
State	ORGANIZATION	to defend a man who has violated any other part of the Criminal Code .

		On the Continent the defendant 's lawyer has the last word .

		This is another important , indeed in - dispensable right the prisoner has conquered through ages of struggle .

		The theory , of course , is , in our system , that he who opens must close .

		But this is a case where the practical instinct of the
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	- American has left him and the logical instinct has gripped him with hooks of steel .

		We are inclined to laugh at the French , for instance , who are ana - lytic and logical and build up systems a priori , and we a `` re loud in praise of our own instincts which are practical : we do not build up our systems of thought and action by a priori methods but by trial and error , by additions and modifications to the al - ready existing structure .

		How does it happen , then , that we have been led astray by symmetry -LRB- above all things symmetry -RRB- and the French have departed from their architec - tonic propensities and built practically ?

		But if we wish to retain a fetish , if we wish the prosecution to close , why not give the prosecution first say on summing up ; then give the defense a chance to com - bat the arguments advanced , and then allow the prosecution ' the last word and an opportunity to combat the defendant 's arguments ?

		But Con - tinental Europeans have gone farther , and laid down the fundamental proposition that the prisoner must have the last word .

		There the prosecution opens the summinjg up , the defense answers ; and then , if the prosecution desires to rejoin , it may .

		But if it does , the defense has the last word .

		This is practical and logical .

		Now we come to a most significant element in the trial of a case : the rules that govern the admission of matter to be presented to the jury .

		In our system we have an elaborate , intricate body of rules by which evidence is admitted or excluded .

		In
Continental Europe	ORGANIZATION	they have no such system of exclusionary rules .

		Everything goes in .

		The wit - nesses are produced , and they give their testimony , uncontrolled and unshackled .

		The witness comes to the bar and relates his story in the form of an uninterrupted narration .

		When he has finished questions may be asked of him , but during his original narration he is free as the air and can keep the floor for almost as long as he wishes .

		In the Bolo trial , for instance ,
Caillaux	PERSON	came forward and made his speech .

		This is a typical example of the method and its implications .

		Under our system hours and hours and hours would have been con - sumed in drawing out the testimony by question and answer .

		In the actual case only about an hour and a half were spent .

		And the facts that came out were much more numerous than by the other method .

		In the second Masses trial ,
John Reed	PERSON	was called to the stand and was anxious to give a detailed account of the origin and development of his hatred of war .

		There was some argument as to whether any of this was admissible , as being '' too remote '' from the issue , therefore irrelevant and wasteful of the
Court	ORGANIZATION	's time .

		All the while the
Court	ORGANIZATION	's time was being wasted by the argument - as to whether th < > irest ` mony was relevant or not .

		When some of the matter was finally admitted and the witness had begun to narrate his experiences there was objection by the District Attorney , and objection again by the Judge himself .

		A great deal of the evidence the witness wished to give , and which would have been not only relevant but powerful in the determination of the conviction or acquittal , was excluded , and the rest of the testi - mony the defendant gave created little effect because he was interrupted often and the atmosphere created by the impatience of the judge was detrimental to the legitimate effect of the story upon the jury .

		Under the European systems this could not be .

		The judge has no right to stop the mouth of a man who comes to the witness stand , be he defendant or other witness .

		Again , in the Nearing trial , al - though the judge was exceedingly liberal under the rules , although he gave the defendant great latitude upon direct examination and greater latitude , as was natural , upon cross-examination , the impression upon the jury , due to the method of question and answer in which the information comes piecemeal , disconnectedly , and in uninteresting fashion to the jury , was not what it would have been if the de - fendant could have given his testimony in narrative
1919	DATE	THE DIAL = 649 form and untrammeled by rules of evidence .

		The contrast between the effect upon the jury of .

		Mr.
Nearing	PERSON	's examination on the stand and his direct narration to the jury on summing up is instructive to men desirous of changing our system for the better .

		But the point is this : parties to an action , and political prisoners particularly , ought not to be subject to the whims , fancies , or mistakes of a judge in the admission or exclusion of evidence .

		The stakes are too great .

		It is better to get in too much than too little .

		And our system lets into a trial too little and that little undramatically , unimpressively , and ineffectively .

		Political prisoners lose by the exclusion of evidence . ''

		Remote '' or '' proximate , '' the evidence ought to be admitted .

		Who can tell what is proximate and what remote ?

		The judges differ .

		One judge is more liberal and allows an exposition of theory ; another is strict and permits no discussion of the economic or political or social theory of the defendant but limits him closely to the technical issues of law and of fact in the case .

		For instance ,
Nearing	ORGANIZATION	, under the
Continental Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean system , would have been allowed to .

		give a connected , elaborate explanation of the origin and development of his beliefs .

		He began to detail his experiences in the
Child Labor Committee	ORGANIZATION	, and the objection came with the ruling that that was too remote .

		I do not wish to criticize this ruling of the judge 's it seems ungracious to do so when Judge
Mayer	PERSON	was almost as liberal as a judge could be under a hampering system .

		Other matter was admitted : the platform of the
Socialist Party	ORGANIZATION	, the War Proclamation , and numerous other things be - lieved to reveal the intent of the author in writing the worlc .

		Did he intend to cause insubordination , disloyalty or refusal of duty ?

		Did he intend to ob - struct the recruiting and enlisting service ?

		All facts whether seemingly relevant or , irrelevant , remote or proximate , ought to be allowed .

		Who can tell after the trial whether a thing is remote or proximate ?

		And all the more , who can tell before the end ?

		The remedy is to allow a free hand , to permit a complete exposition .

		This , as I have found by practical experience in European Courts , actually saves time , and presents a more comprehensive and vivid view of the case to the jury .

		The acquittal of Mr.
Nearing	PERSON	and the conviction of the American Socialist Society the corporation which had been indicted with him for the publica - tion of the pamphlet ,
The Great Madness	ORGANIZATION	, seems to point to a compromise verdict .

		The evidence against the Society was much weaker than that against the individual , yet the first was convicted and the second freed .

		Nothing can be more shocking to the average lawyer , brought up on the pabulum of the schools , than the suggestion that anything is wrong with the law or legal procedure .

		To such blind followers of tradition I recommend a reading of
Bentham	PERSON	's
Rationale of Judicial Evidence	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here are some of his choice phrases , sober , steady and excessively temperate and devoid of agitatory features : Evidence is the basis of justice ; to exclude evidence is to exclude justice .

		By example , by reward , by compulsion , by every means possible or imaginable , we shall see -LRB- every man does see it who does not shut his eyes against it -RRB- this most mischievous of all vices propagated under the shelter of the technical system , propagated by the professed and offi - cial guardians of the public morals ; and among the in - struments of this disastrous husbandry are to be found some of the most efficient of the evidence-excluding rules .

		From the above description of the nature of the mis - chief may be deduced the description of the persons in - terested in the pushing it up to the highest possible pitch ; mala fide suitors on both sides , including malefactors of all sorts , their accomplices and well wishers ; men of law , as being the natural allies of malefactors and other mala fide suitors ; under the technical system judges and other officials as well as professional lawyers '' ; professional lawyers under any system .

		Exclusion -LRB- as will be seen -RRB- is the grand engine by the help of which corruption has been enabled to gain its ends ; and by which arbitrary power with the jus nocendi it enforces , has been acquired ; that faculty the acquisition of which is so delightful to the human heart whether on the particular occasion in question there be or be not a disposition to employ it .

		.

		These are hard words .


Bentham	PERSON	did not mince matters .

		No espionage act prevented robust speech .

		We today need not go so far as to say that rules of evidence breed corruption or that the partnership of Judge and
Co.	ORGANIZATION	, as he terms the combination of judges and lawyers , '' is interested in depraving the moral and intellectual faculties of the people '' ; or that just as '' alchemy -LSB- is -RSB- the art of cheating men on pretense of making gold , astrology , the - art of cheating men on pretense of foretelling future events -LSB- so -RSB- judicature under technical rules -LSB- is -RSB- the art of cheating men on pretense of admin - istering justice '' ; or that law is a '' fortuitous con - cord of technical atoms '' ; or that it employs '' devices for promoting the ends of established pro- cedure at the expense of the ends of justice '' ; or that the habit is pernicious '' of eulogizing juris - prudential -LSB- that is , judge made -RSB- law at the expense of statutory , sham law at the expense of real law '' ; or that '' the technical system of rules of evidence is the mechanical system '' ; or that
England	LOCATION	is today the slough it was in
Bentham	LOCATION	's day , for
England	LOCATION	in her procedure is far more advanced than we in this country are .

		But we can follow the great legal surgeon when he says , seeing that the exclusionary system still flourishes in all its luxuriant rankness on this side of the water , that '' jails have had their Howard ; jurisprudence waits for one . ''

		The French read it whilst the Dreyfus Affair was excit - ing every kind of prejudice .

		A minority of in - tellectuals , and all the young men of ideals just coming to knowledge of the actual world , were struggling against strong patriotic generalities and comfortable absolutisms .

		It would be an outrage to the
Army	ORGANIZATION	to doubt the legality of a judgment rendered by the
Council of War !	ORGANIZATION

		Seven officers together could not be wrong !

		The
Army	ORGANIZATION	was exalted by the Royalists , who were rallying to the Republic only because of the danger to the
Army	ORGANIZATION	's prestige , and by the masses , eagerly anti-Semite .

		The state was seemingly facile and corrupt .

		Even
M. Bergeret	PERSON	in
Paris	LOCATION	, the last in the series , was published before the end , while
Anatole France	LOCATION	was still skeptical of the triumph of justice .

		He might well wish to encourage toughmindedness about the human species under a republic .

		He was not concerned to sow seeds of that faith in the com - mon man which is now being called on to move mountains .

		He could appeal to the love of the Few for clarity and all the relativeness of life .

		Aroused , the Few might be strong enough to enforce the criticism of self , and the revision of the
Dreyfus	ORGANIZATION	condemnation .

		He struck at hypocrisy on every side .

		His attack is energetic and beguilingly skilful , and his enjoyment of it is pervasive and con - tagious .

		Indeed , in the world he creates , the only probable pleasure he recognizes is the free and witty use of the critical intelligence .


M. Bergeret	PERSON	, lec - turer in classics on a provincial faculty , is made thoroughly to enjoy the ruthless activity of his own mind .

		His pleasure is really the only pleasure in the book .

		The rest of the world is almost joyless , except when now and then someone has a brief sense of power or success .

		Madame Worms -
Clavelin	PERSON	had been a
Paris	LOCATION	street arab , and now ` she lived in good society , belonged to the ruling classes , and in all her intrigues had really had to do only with men of the world .

		So she can now sometimes feel mystical , and grateful to the Virgin , in a way she never - could when still a Jewess .

		Young Bon - mont has moments of agreeable confidence in the power of his money .

		But most of the time he pro- tects himself from other men by an air of being tranquilly and steadily disagreeable .

		His senti - mental mother indulges herself with every possible romance , but is never able to love her lovers trust - fully and peacefully , according to her nature .

		The Abbe
Guitrel	PERSON	wins the bishopric , but his opportunist way with life is not made out pleasurable to him .


M. Bergeret	PERSON	's constant satisfaction in his own un - fettered intelligence is all that is joyful .

		How he delights in humanizing his learning !

		His speculations about the nature of Hercules make the legendary strongman an enigmatical present fact , affecting our everyday consciousness .

		Anatole
France	LOCATION	has always found it particular fun to fill the world with such realized figures from the past that they lose their historic distance and have some imme - diate significance that is disquieting .

		And this absorbing activity of
M. Bergeret	PERSON	's mind allows him to keep the good temper of an Olympian .

		He never too vividly realizes little annoyances .

		He never gets acrimonious .

		He is generous to all the smaller satisfactions .

		He can be really conscious that arranging his library , and driving nails into the walls , is a sensuous enjoyment , a way to feel like a voluptuary .

		It is delightful to him to make a close relation between his philosophy and his devoted little dog , Riquet .

		He can discuss amiably immortality , or the weakness of truth .

		The Dreyfus Affair even can not involve
M. Bergeret	PERSON	in the general ill-temper .

		He had come out against the condemnation , and had been hooted in the streets .

		He had attacked the secrecy of the trial , maintaining that
France	LOCATION	could not plead reasons of state .

		She had administrations , but no such entity as the state .

		The
Army	ORGANIZATION	was as much an administration as the departments of agriculture and finance .

		Military justice was as gothic and barbarous as had been the justice of the feudal lords .

		And liberty of thought had never any more sup - porters than a minority of the intellectuals .

		Popular enthusiasm could never be counted on .

		The Dreyfus Affair had called for a hard kind of reason - ing that only thinkers in good practice would be capable of .


M. Bergeret	PERSON	is skeptical , but not ill - tempered and he risks his livelihood by being openly a revisionist .

		While the other administrations in
France	LOCATION	may well have seemed fallible to
M. Bergeret	PERSON	, that could not have been his judgment of
the Ministry of Education	ORGANIZATION	, which first promotes him on his pro- vincial faculty , and then makes him professor at the
Sorbonne	LOCATION	.

		It must have been consistently loyal to the claims of the mind .

		And
M. Bergeret	PERSON	, not unaware of being philosophically subjective , changes his opinion that life is nothing but a mold , consum - ing our decaying planet alone , into a belief that all the planets may provide light and heat for life and

M. Berger	PERSON	- et 's irony and good humor are immensely helped by being subsidized .

		The question , after all , however , remains : how far is
M. Bergeret	PERSON	's pleasure '' put over '' in this translation ?

		What will be the American reader 's chief memory of the book , now that the world feels congested ?

		Whilst the French read it , they were constantly excited by its manner , amused and quick - ened by every turn of phrase .

Separation of Goods	ORGANIZATION	.

		Once appointed , he declares himself in opposition , and quotes the same pastoral letter of Pope

		His rival for the bishopric has been an honest intransigent , en - thusiastic for the ancient faith , who has not been able to play the Minister , and the Nuncio , and the Jews .

		He has jerked on the bare hook of truth .

		In their dreary grey , too , the Breces make one lenient to radicalisms that would be abhorrent to
Anatole France	LOCATION	.

		They are full of ritualisms and superstitions and passionately anti-Semite .

		Yet gifts to the Church buy for the Bonmonts , Jews whose name was

		The Breces are dangerously stupid and helpless .

		Where can the general reader find faith in the ruling classes ?

		Or is it true that he still likes to be hardheaded ?

		EDITH
BORIE	PERSON	.

		The Ways of Genius IT is COMMON among amiable critics of the incon - clusive to say with a flourish that So-and-so '' lived '' his book , or his opera , or what not .

		As if there were any distinction in that !

		Some nine hundred ninety-nine of every thousand human beings do that .

		The thousandth , the genius or near-genius , tor - mented by a malady he comes slowly if ever to understand , must write or compose or paint his life ; and we , recognizing his distinction , say lamely that he has '' talent , '' or '' temperament , '' or '' genius . ''

		Whereas it has been held , and not without evidence , that what he really has is a disease certainly a plague .

		It is his lot to be challenged , perplexed , de - feated by life until he can turn it into something -LRB- as the philosophers say -RRB- not-life , but often so like life , and yet so curiously more than life , that we gape over his shoulder , marveling that in a brief while , with ' only a pen or some pigments , he should thus easily win through to what we have struggled toward in long sweat and blood .

		Probably mankind has always recognized and ac - corded distinction to this creative faculty .

		But has it ever been understood ?

		Like madness , to which it is perhaps akin , it has been regarded as a badge of the favor of the gods , a vessel for divine revelation , or a private factory of truth .

		Then , in more sophisti - cated times , it has been treated as a social accom - plishment , a supererogatory elegance : certain men , having taken life like the rest of us , afterward see fit to gossip about it in whatever art comes handiest to them .

		But that neither the inspirational nor the representative theory is adequate to explain genius may be inferred from the persistent curiosity with which the ordinary man regards the artist .

		The farmer who halts plowing to quiz the painter in his field is the symbol for us all .

		We have never , to borrow Clerk
Maxwell	PERSON	's idiom , got the '' particu - lar go '' of the artistic temperament .

		To be sure , we have had plenty of books which studied the periphery of the artist 's interests ; but have we had any that succeeded in plucking out the heart of his mystery ?

Martin Schiiler	PERSON	-LRB- Holt -RRB- , which the publishers advertise , with an un - wonted restraint that compels quotation , as '' one of those successful novels about genius that comes very close to being itself a work of genius . ''

		It is un - necessary to decide whether the book is the latter in order to recognize that it is much more than the former ; that it is , indeed , pretty much the first suc - cessful novel about genius as a creative force .


Martin Schiiler	PERSON	is a composer whose own notions about his processes are never clear .

		He begins life with ambitious plans for a grand opera based on a fairy tale about beautiful maidens spellbound as pea - hens , but wins his earliest successes with sentimental songs and waltzes .

		From
Heidelberg	LOCATION	, where he has produced a promising operetta , he is carried off to Leipsic by an extraordinary young patron ,
Stein	PERSON	- bach , to whom he cries : '' Oh , my mind , my mind !

		It bursts sometimes for the experience it has not got . ''

		Already he has begun the acquisition of experi - ence , which at first he seeks with calculating direct - ness .

		He has seduced and deserted a young girl .

		He has studied in
Paris	LOCATION	, and wooed inspiration with love , alcohol , opium .

		From beneath the corpse of his friend
Werner	PERSON	-LRB- in whom the author has sympa - thetically portrayed frustrate genius -RRB- he has stolen the libretto for The Peahens , but is so wrung with superstitious terror that he has hidden the manu - script away .

		As for the musical materials for The Peahens , the beyond , the heavens , the desert were in his mind .

		He was not yet able to see them ; but every mouth , every emotion , every piece of knowledge , every attempt , he came nearer to them .

		Some day he would be able to visualize them , some day to realize them .

		Realization for him meant to be able to turn into sound .

		No experience is real to him until it has become music , echoing in his memory .

		Of the raw materials for such experience loves , quarrels , exaltations , and despairs ; all the meanness , cruelty , and ecstasy of which undisciplined genius is capable from now on he has enough .

		He steals
Steinbach	PERSON	's fiancee ,
Hella	PERSON	, and then wants to kill
Steinbach	PERSON	.

		With
Hella	PERSON	he runs away to the Alps for an idyllic interlude of love , thinking he has done with music , both the high art of his dreams and the lower thing of his practice , though he has no idea what else he will do beyond marrying
Hella	PERSON	.

		Steinbach concocts a musical comedy from sketches
Martin	PERSON	has abandoned , and
Martin	PERSON	precipitately drags
Hella	PERSON	back to Leipsic to produce it .

		His next piece is a great success in Ber - lin , where shortly he becomes very much the man of fashion and -LRB-
Hella	ORGANIZATION	dismissed unmarried -RRB- the lover of the most beautiful matron in the capital .

		Then , at the apex of his vogue as a light composer ,
Martin	PERSON	hears his too popular song of the moment ground out by a hurdy-gurdy , on the instant ex - plosively sickens of his long treason to his vocation ^ makes a murderous attack on his secretary as the embodiment of everything that has debauched his musical integrity , and goes to his villa in the Schwarzwald to escape his intolerable defeat .

		This is the mere outline of the emotional material that be - came , as fast as he could hear it inside him ,
Martin Schiiler	PERSON	the composer .

		Now in the
Schwarzwald	LOCATION	, he sat and looked across his large writing-table out of the window in a dream .

		It was the first time he had ever experienced a clear vision of the past , or had sought to remember anything out of it .

		Up to now the present and future had been sufficient for him .

		He had never yet drawn upon his resources : he had taken everything out of the air , out of his friends , out of the incidents of his life as they occurred .

		In a short time he began to - read the manuscript of The Peahens .

		There , and afterwards in
Munich	LOCATION	when , ironic - ally , he has received a Nobel prize for his former , , too popular music , '' because the world thought his day was over , '' and the
Kaiser	PERSON	has made him a count he works on nothing but The Peahens : He wrote entirely from the memory of his dreams , and from the copy of those visionless thoughts that in past years had with pain and labor expressed themselves under his hand .

		On the
night	TIME	The Peahens is triumphantly produced at the
Berlin Opera House	ORGANIZATION	, he dies in his box .

		That is perhaps an unnecessary conclusion .

		But it does emphasize the fact that the real life of this genius was his music , and was complete when his music was completed .

		Nothing that happened to him in the crowded years of maturing emotion be - came life till he had got it into sound , and as sound it was remembered . ''

		I can never recall to you , '' he says to
Hella	PERSON	, '' except in music , the charm of those past days . ''

		In the beginning The Peahens was a vague dream which he could not put into words ; and that , if you like , was '' inspiration . ''

		Gradually , by subjecting himself to everything which could make him feel and by learning to '' hear '' his feel - ings , he acquired the power to put that dream into music ; and this , if you care to call it so , was '' rep - resentation . ''

		But he was never vehicle to an ex - ternal '' message , '' never the ordinary man living richly and '' translating '' his life into an art .

		His masterpiece was a fabric of his emotions '' recol - lected in tranquility '' ; but his recollected emotions were sounds , as those of the true painter are lines and colors , and those of the true writer are speak - ing phrases .

		By the perception of this fact
Miss Wilson	PERSON	has distinguished her fine novel among fictional discus - sions of genius .

		No longer do writers form a caste apart , an institution devoted to competition in the production of masterpieces , seeking like
Milton	PERSON	`` to leave something so written to aftertimes as they should not willingly let it die . ''

		On the contrary in these days of popular education everyone writes , or threatens to do so , and measures his success not in length of time but in extent of space not by fit audience though few extending in a thin line down the centuries , but by the unfit and vast assembly of readers scattered over the whole world , who for a month or a year may be held by the potent charm of a best-seller .

		Everyone reads , and supplying read - ing matter to an immense and voracious public has become a business like supplying it with clothes and food .

		This public is uneducated in the art of ex - pression .

		It is primarily interested in subject mat - ter .

		And writers , subdued to public taste , are no longer devoted to form , seeking subjects that will serve as material for epic , tragedy , or sonnet se - quence .

		On the contrary they spend their gifts on finding what material will take the public , and adopt - ing a form which will serve most directly and pow - erfully to convey this material to its destination .

		Now , the chief uses which a democracy has for lit - erature are two education and entertainment .

		In both respects , it must be admitted , the demands of the public are in an elementary stage .

		What is wanted in education is a rough general knowledge of the world in which we live and some data to direct our course efficiently in it .

		For entertainment the mass of men are dependent on appeals to the senses , but there is one form of intellectual enjoy - ment which is wide-spread , the satisfaction of curi - osity , the emotion which is stirred by novelty .

		The questions which the multitude of readers ask in re - gard to any writing are : Is it true ?

		Is it impor - tant ?

		Is it interesting ?

		Our demands for truth to life and for guidance in the efficient conduct of it find satisfaction in that mass of material drawn from the lives of human beings which we call real - ism ; and our demand for interest is best served by that touch of novelty and timeliness which is of ` the nature of journalism .

		A term , then , which covers a large part of present-day writing is journalistic realism .

		The extent to which this term has become appli - cable in those departments of literature of which formal technique has been most characteristic is ob - vious in modern drama and poetry .

		The so-called renaissance of the drama is due to the discovery by
Ibsen	PERSON	and his successors that the stage is not lim - ited by technique to a certain prescribed subject - matter , but may deal effectively with the immediate realities of modern existence .

		The renaissance of poetry is due to the same discovery .

		But it is in the novel that the triumph of journalistic realism over technical considerations is most pronounced .

		The novel form , owing to its hybrid origin and bour - geois history , has never suffered from the obsession of sacrOsanctity .

		.

		Fortunately , perhaps , no one has ever known exactly what a novel is .

		Certain tech - nical principles of plot , character drawing , and back - ground development have been held to constitute a technique of the novel , to which the characteristic modern altitude is that of Mr.
Wells	PERSON	, proclaiming
Laurence Stern	PERSON	the greatest of English novelists be - cause he is farthest ' removed from such technique .

		Even before the war such books as Number 5
John Street	PERSON	, Children of the Dead End , and Ragged Trousered Philanthropists were recognized as among the most powerful examples of prose narrative , be - cause by their disregard of novelistic conventions they approach infinitely closer to life and lay empha - sis with infinitely more exactness upon its overwhelm - ing and tragic facts .

		The war has given great im - petus to such writing , to such journalistic novels as Mr.
Britling	PERSON	Sees It Through and
Blind Alley	ORGANIZATION	, which have merely a thin convention of fiction .

		And the actual experience of war has given birth to narratives of a reality so stark and terrible that the reenforcement of fiction would be an impertinence .

		The extension of such experience among men , in - stead of its limitation to a professional soldiery , finds evidence in the difference between Le Feu and La Debacle .

		To the universalizing of such experi - ence the democratic art of journalistic realism is a witness .

		We are reminded once more that literature is a fine art , and that as in all education , < so in the artistic , as in all entertainment , so in the esthetic , is literature best fitted to serve modern men .

		Only the artistic can no longer render this service by devo - tion to an aristocratic formula of his ancestors , of his social equals , or of his own .

		Indeed , it may be questioned whether the ^ greatest literature was not always the unsought result of an unfathomable com - bination of the Maker 's soul with that of his fellow - 654 THE DIAL
June 28	DATE	men only whereas in the past it was only the souls of the few who counted , today it is the soul of democ - racy .

		At least this is certain : the true esthetic can - not be imposed from without by individual genius or eccentricity , nor can it be recovered from the past by study .

		It is more than ever before the im - mediate result of human need , human aspiration , hu - man agony .

		It can not be complete unless it take account of the experience of the entire race , in which for the first time in the world 's story the soul of man is tragically one .

		IF ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE BE NEEDED TO CON - vince the peoples of the world of the vicious con - stitution of the Great Powers at
Versailles	LOCATION	the latest reports on the Russian situation serve that purpose admirably .

		On
May 26	DATE	the Big Four made overtures to
Kolchak	LOCATION	, the terrorist dictator of
Siberia	LOCATION	.

		They laid down certain conditions upon which they would accord his government recognition .

		On
June II Kolchak	DATE	's answer was cabled from
Paris	LOCATION	.

		It was a refusal , according to the
New York	LOCATION	Sun , of practically all the conditions established by the peace conference .

		Did that demolish the plan of reactionary intervention ?

		By no means .

		The Allied and
Associated Powers	ORGANIZATION	knew better than Kolchak what they , meant by their conditions for recognition .

		They gracefully sent a reply welcom - ing his '' substantial agreement '' and '' satisfactory assurances '' and renewing their promise of support as set forth in their original letter .

		In other words , to quote the original letter , '' they are disposed to assist the government of Admiral
Kolchak	PERSON	and his associates with munitions , supplies , and food to establish themselves as the government of All
Russia	LOCATION	. ''

		This offer is based upon '' a cardinal axiom of the Allied and
Associated Powers	ORGANIZATION	to avoid interference in the internal affairs of
Russia	LOCATION	. ''

		Through this clotted mass of contradictory state - ment the purposes of the Big Four seem nevertheless evident .

		They intend to disregard the weakness of Kolchak 's army , as indicated in the current reports in the daily press .

		They purpose to overlook the direct testimony of the
New York Globe	ORGANIZATION	and the
Chicago Daily News	ORGANIZATION	, published on the authority of their
Moscow	LOCATION	correspondent , as to the soundness of law and order in
Soviet Russia	LOCATION	, the willingness of the Soviet government to make peace , and the steady increase of the
Russian Republic	ORGANIZATION	's strength as a result * of the Allies ' obdurate refusal to enter into friendly negotiations .

		The Powers appear likewise willing to treat as negligible the reactionary monarchist character of the Kolchak group , as established again and again by neutral observers , and described as recently as
June 15	DATE	in the conservative and circum - spect
New York	LOCATION	Times !

		In the interest of vested privilege the
Big Four	ORGANIZATION	will set out to overthrow the now soundly established
Soviet Republic	LOCATION	, and will stake their integrity on a government feeble in mili - tary forces , destitute of moral authority , and com - pletely lacking in the elements of a democratic political state .

		If the Big Four are indeed ready to put this Prussic policy into effect they will have drawn a clean line of demarkation between the peoples of the world and their governments .

		In , the face of such a coalition of reactionary powers there can be no paltering : the recognition of Kolchak is a direct and final challenge to all liberal-minded men .

		The liberals of all nations must either unite to take up the challenge or condemn themselves to impotent disintegration .

		On the decision of liberalism in this crisis the very existence of free institutions rests .

		If it can not fight its enemies it will never have the privilege of living with them .

		The tolerance of liberalism can be secured only by establishing its strength .

		1 HE THIRTY-NINTH ANNUAL CONVENTION OF the
American Federation	ORGANIZATION	lived its short life beneath a cloud of officialism shot through with gleams of rough reality .

		From a fighting past the
Federation	ORGANIZATION	has inherited a military organization that falls nat - urally into line and staff .

		And like the staff of an army at peace ,
A. F. L.	ORGANIZATION	officialdom polishes its but - tons , perfects its salutes , and trots the household troops out occasionally for a sham battle leads a convention off to
Washington	LOCATION	to fight for beer , the impending loss of which beverage causes President
Gompers	PERSON	to fear for the first time for the future of the country .

		Mr.
Gompers	PERSON	has somehow succeeded in classifying prohibition as
Bolshevistic	LOCATION	, and in the higher circles of the
A. F. L.	PERSON	, as in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, that word sends rattling down to death whatever thing it touches .

		Nevertheless there are memories of the pre-respectable period of the
A. F. L.	PERSON	that will not down memories of open warfare once and again in
Colorado	LOCATION	; memories of a day when the Washing - ton headquarters of the
Federation	ORGANIZATION	could say , re - ferring not unsympathetically to the
McNamara	PERSON	case : `` It is an awful commentary upon existing conditions when one man , among all the millions * of workers , can bring himself to the frame of mind that the only means to secure justice for labor is vio - lence , outrage and murder . ''

		Even today come ru - mors that the official recognition which has proved so soothing to labor 's representatives at
Washington	LOCATION	and
Paris	LOCATION	has not yet been granted everywhere ; in
McKeesport	LOCATION	and Homestead and other towns of
Western Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, A. F. L organizers must hold their meetings out of doors or not at all they are
Bolsheviki	LOCATION	; in
Columbus	LOCATION	,
Georgia	LOCATION	,
A. F. L.	PERSON	strikers are shot down they are
Bolsheviki	ORGANIZATION	.

		In `` the line of the army '' the
A. F. L.	PERSON	still has its fighters who see the cause of the oppressed as one cause and do not meet rebellion with the ready damnation of a word .

		Just as long as these fighters drag the old staff with them , the
A. F. L.	PERSON	will , like any other army , go forward backward .

		IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE ANTI-RADICAL BILL INTRO - duced by Senator King plays directly into the hands of the reactionary kind of revolutionist .

		This mea -
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 655 sure is a forceful example of the sort of government the nation may expect when the
National Security League	ORGANIZATION	consolidates with the
American Protective League	ORGANIZATION	and establishes -LRB- under a wooden Kolchak -RRB- a dictatorship of the propertariat .

		But as a poten - tial law for a constitutional republic the King bill is baldly ridiculous .

		In the very first section of this '' act to protect the government of the
United States	LOCATION	'' it writes a conspiracy clause for the first time into Federal law , annuls the first amendment of the constitution , proclaims the perfection of the form of government it aims to destroy , and estab - lishes the crime of lese majeste on a basis broad enough to hedge the entire executive establishment , from Burlesbn upwards , with that immunity from assault and criticism which becomes a sovereign by divine right .

		The height of stultification , however , is attained in the fourth section .

		It reads :
Sec	ORGANIZATION	.

		4 .

		Any person , firm , or corporation who shall wil - fully make or convey false reports or false statements or shall say or do anything except by way of bona fide advice to an investor or investors , with intent to obstruct the sale by the
United States	LOCATION	of bonds or other securities of the
United States	LOCATION	, or the making of loans to or by the
United States	LOCATION	... shall be punished by a fine of not more than
$ 5,000	MONEY	and imprisonment not to exceed three years ... '' This is the work of either a satirist or a born fool .

		It would be difficult to believe that it could be anything but a deliberate attempt to prove the propertariat bias of the bill , were it not for the fact that an official of the
National City Bank	ORGANIZATION	could have been sentenced to prison under its provisions the other day for saying in public not merely to bona fide investors that further loans to foreign governments were unjustifiably risky .

		These objec - tions are but pinpricks in a document that gapes with constitutional holes .

		.

		From first to last the King bill lives up to its name : for all the recognition it accords the Constitution it might have been drafted by
Lord North	ORGANIZATION	on behalf of King
George III	PERSON	for the express purpose of frustrating the Amer - ican revolution .

		Its whole intention and method run contrary to the
Bill of Rights	ORGANIZATION	.

		To this ex - tent the measure carries with it an antidote for its own poisons .

		Should popular opinion be supine enough to permit enactment , it is obvious that the first criminals to be arrested under the act -LRB- sen - atorial immunity aside -RRB- would be the very persons who sponsored and promulgated it .

		Did Senator King see how wilfully his law had '' defied and disregarded '' the Constitution when he so rigor - ously provided for his own punishment ?

		Were the law honestly carried out Senator King would be taught how dangerous it is to protect an institution by the subversive experiment of doing away with it .

		But if the Constitution is still a serviceable in - strument , that sacred document will at all events protect Senator
King	PERSON	from the results of his own follies .

		Let us trust that the measure will not progress so far .

		If the American people are fully alive to the dangers of counter revolutionary hys - teria , fomented by private security leagues and es - pionage organizations , they will drive the bill out of the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	before it has a chance to be laughed out of court .

		It needs only a concerted protest to re - mind
Congress	ORGANIZATION	that the American state is still enough of a republic to be opposed fiercely to the protection of the
United States Government	ORGANIZATION	through the instrumentality of a King .

		ARE SELECTION OF CURRENT FICTION WHICH THE DIAL proffers on page 670 of this issue has value in that it is a composite photograph of the opinions of a considerable number of habitually crit - ical readers , a rough index to the verdicts of many scattered and diversified reviewers .

		As such , it shows the lay of the field .

		And the query raised by the present list is a familiar one : Why does
America	LOCATION	produce so little serious fiction of good quality ?

		On this list the English titles outnumber the American nearly three to one , although the English are all imported .

		Moreover , the American books are , with only an exception or two , devoted to adventure , mystery , or humor ; so that , in this season at least , we have one established name that of Mr.
Hergesheimer	PERSON	to oppose to the roll of Conrad ,
Wells	ORGANIZATION	,
Bennett	PERSON	,
Galsworthy	PERSON	,
Swinnerton	LOCATION	,
Delafield	ORGANIZATION	,
Walpole	LOCATION	,
Beresford	PERSON	,
George	PERSON	, and
McKenna	PERSON	.

		Last season 's shorter list showed about the same ratio , and had only Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	to add .

		The Christmas list was more evenly divided , but since some of the American publications were posthumous , offered no more than Mr.
Cable	PERSON	, Miss Gather , and Mr.
Web	PERSON	- ster .

		The very sharp contrast in the current list ought doubtless to be corrected by certain qualifica - tions : English novelists appear to publish more fre - quently than do serious American novelists ; lately there has been a marked increase in the importation of English novels -LRB- which of itself connotes a short - age in the domestic supply -RRB- ; probably more Ameri - can than English novelists have been temporarily deflected into journalism by the war ; and so on .

		Such considerations soften the picture a little : they scarcely alter the fact .

		In the production of best - selling romances , of magazine stories , and of moving - picture scenaries we have no real competition ; but in the production of narrative that represents life as it is lived we fall shockingly behind the English , both as regards quality and as regards quantity .

		That it is the fault of our scene or the fault of our public are familiar explanations , probably true enough in their degree .

		But the scene grows stead - ily richer and the public 's demand for good , fiction constantly increases , as witness the number of im - portations and translations in this season 's list and yet the production shows little promise of catching up .

		It is hard to avoid the conclusion that the sup - ply of good American fiction lingers behind the de - mand for it chiefly because the pens that ought to be engaged in its production are too well paid for maintaining our supremacy in the best-seller , the story , and the movie .

		6
5 6 June 28	DATE	Communications THE QUESTION OF NATIONALISM .

		SIR : I have before me a pamphlet dealing with the first
Canadian Jewish Congress	ORGANIZATION	, recently held in
Montreal	LOCATION	, written by a well-known Zionist , himself a delegate to the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and an active member of its various committees .

		It is supposed to be an '' analytic review '' of the aims and objects of Can - adian Jewry , as crystallized at the
Montreal Con	ORGANIZATION	- gress .

		In the flood of articles dealing with the sub - ject , full of eulogies and unwarranted praise , this particular pamphlet has drawn my especial attention , because it makes at least an attempt to deal honestly and critically with the problem .

		The question of nationalization involved in a discussion of this nature will , to my mind , prove of interest to the readers of your magazine .

		Now , then , the author of the Review admits from the outset that the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	has failed in its attempts to form '' a general Jewish assembly , where all the different factions , classes , and interests of Canadian Jewry shall concentrate and unite into one solid front to stand for and protect their common inter - ests . ''

		He does not , however , see the causes which are responsible for the failure .

		He fails to under - stand that the '' solidarity and unity '' of a nation , under the present system of society , is rather a myth .

		He also fails to know that the so-called democratic parliaments -LRB- even in
England	LOCATION	, the cradle of modern parliamentarism -RRB- do not truthfully and honestly represent the interests of the nation as a whole , simply because under capitalistic conditions there is no such thing as a '' nation as a whole . ''

		The epi - demic of revolutionary strikes in
Great Britain	LOCATION	fol - lowing upon the heels of the last general election proves conclusively two things : First , the total bank - ruptcy of modern parliamentarism and , second , the big chasm in the one and the same nation the an - tagonistic class interests within the same nation pre - dominating over the artificial national interests .

		This naturally leads us to another question which has escaped the attention of this '' critical reviewer '' namely , the question of the necessity or even the desirability of preserving these elements which , to be sure , have played a certain role in the past , but which have long lost their usefulness , nay , which have be - come detrimental to human progress .

		The old fundamentals of social life , which are largely responsible for social injustice and inequality ; which have brought about the antagonism between man and man ; which provoked and finally produced the world war , the greatest catastrophe in human history those fundamentals , those forces are , hap - pily , on the decline .

		New forces are looming up on the horizon , forces more of a social than of a national character .

		But among those forces which are doomed to disappear in the New Society , Nationalism , espe - cially religious Nationalism as is the case among the Jews is the most reactionary and most detri - mental to progress .

		People usually distinguish between
Nationalism	ORGANIZATION	and Chauvinism .

		It is claimed that
Nationalism	ORGANIZATION	is an element of defense , while Chauvinism is aggres - sive .

		This is quite an erroneous conception .

		The difference between the former and the latter is only a matter of degree .

		Nationalism arriving at a cer - tain stage of its development must necessarily be transformed into Chauvinism .

		Nationalism is con - sequently '' the origin of Chauvinism .

		Nationalism principally aims to attach itself to the past , the past with all its dead weight , which only hinders the forward march .

		But to return to our '' Reviewer , '' who , notwith - standing his critical analysis , has great faith in the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and its ability to solve the Jewish problem .

		I marvel at his optimism and , if you wish , self-deceit .

		It has been said that '' life is but a succession of un - successful attempts . ''

		That is particularly true with regard to Jewish life .

		Our reviewer is not discour - aged .

		If the first attempt fail , then he will try again .

		He does not understand that the causes which contributed to the failure of the first
Congress	ORGANIZATION	are inherent in the Jewish character and Jewish life .

		He is proud of the old orthodox Jew , '' who stood at the height of his mission and instinctively pre - served the principles and interests of Judaism . ''

		Quite so !

		But the old orthodox Jew is rather a poor foundation upon which to construct a modern state built upon socialistic principles , as many so-called national-socialists dream of in their ignorance .

		1919 THE DIAL 657 Casual Comment The light fiction which serves as traditional pabulum for
summer	DATE	America has already been pub - lished , and once more the question arises as to just why people read it .

		Take for example six of the more ` recent novels .

		All of them will be mod - erately successful ; the worst will sell its two or three thousand copies , and the most successful of them will probably pass the fifty thousand mark .

		About them , all together , there is not enough de - lineation of character , not enough revelation of eternal truths , not enough form in the stricter sense to supply the matter for a good short story .

		The fact remains however that they are read , and that , on a hot afternoon , even the hyper-educated find them more interesting than
Dostoevski	PERSON	.

		Such being the case '' , it is perhaps more reasonable to search for the secret of their popularity than to berate them for lacking of qualities to which they do not aspire .

		It is in
Mary Roberts Rinehart	PERSON	's latest volume -LRB- Love Stories ; 352 pages ;
Doran	PERSON	-RRB- that this secret appears .

		Of the seven tales in the book , six are occupied with the business of getting young people mated ; the seventh is the happy aftermath of a properly pathetic love affair .

		There is nothing new in the matter of any of them , unless it is the cir - cumstance that five are laid in hospitals ; Mrs.
Rine	PERSON	- hart 's method of handling plots is sanctioned by the usuage of generations .

		Yet we eat the stories up ; we are interested in the very primitive business of marrying
Joseph	PERSON	to
Josephine	PERSON	and
Joan	PERSON	to
John	PERSON	.

		Mrs.
Rinehart	PERSON	writes with immense cleverness but without gusto .

		She impresses one as being able , if she wished , to produce literature of permanent value , but she is tired ; she patronizes her public just a little and her characters bore her .

		A master of light fiction , she probably realizes the shortcomings of her medium as much as do any of her readers .

		For the romance with which Mrs.
Rinehart	PERSON	in - vests the modern hospital a romance gained by making ward nurses tender and young , and by metamorphosing internes to spectacled cupids
H. C. Bailey	PERSON	must turn to the
eighteenth century	DATE	, and sanctify professional gamblers .

		In The Game - sters -LRB- 332 pages ; Button -RRB- he is concerned with wonderful twins , Eve and
Adam de Res	PERSON	, who can impersonate each other at will , and who wander all over
Germany	LOCATION	outwitting Frederic the Great .

		Mr.
Bailey	PERSON	goes at breakneck speed , piling incident on incident , but he writes without color and asks miracles of his hero and heroine .

		Another book of the same sort is A Gallant Lady -LRB- 442 pages ;
Duffield	PERSON	-RRB- .

		During the age when no novel was a success unless it purported to be the memoirs of the
Vicomte du Pont	ORGANIZATION	, sometime Master of Horse to His Majesty King Felipe XVIII of
Styria	LOCATION	,
Percy James Brebner	PERSON	could always be re - lied on to crowd more highwaymen , ladies in dis - tress , and disguised heirs-apparent into eighty thousand words than could any of his contem - poraries .

		The styles have changed , and in these days the denouement is more likely to come as the result of an enemy machine gun than after pis - tols and coffee for two .

		Mr.
Brebner	PERSON	however re - mains constant to his former ideals .

		When
Richmond Haigh	PERSON	, in An Ethiopian Saga -LRB- 207 pages ;
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- , turned to African folklore for his material , one hoped for something new .

		But in the breasts of Kundu and
Koloani	PERSON	, his rival Zulu chieftains , and under the black skins of Jamba the young warrior and the maiden Mamelubi beat the same hearts that fired the veins of Mrs.
Rinehart	PERSON	's nurses and animated the dukes and adventurers of Mr.
Brebner	PERSON	.

		The chief difference is one of style ; Mr.
Haigh	PERSON	has adopted a pseudo-Biblical diction and heads every paragraph with a proverb trans - lated from the original Kaffir or Swahiali .

		It remained for
Albert Payson Terhune	PERSON	to take the last step and transfer the romantic emotions of modern society to canine breasts .

		In Lad : A Dog -LRB- 349 pages ;
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- his heroine is proud , self - willed , capricious , his hero faithful and steady .

		Their reactions are those of the human being rather than of the animal .

		However , Mr.
Terhune	PERSON	as - sures us in a postcript that Lad was a real dog , and that most of the incidents actually happened .

		Romance has been called the sugar coating of sex .

		If one makes this coating saccharine instead of sugar , it can be much thinner and still leave the same taste in the mouth .

		Such at least is the theory on which
Elinor Glyn	PERSON	seems to write .

		For her latest novel -LRB- Family ; ' 3 15 pages ;
Appleton	PERSON	-RRB- she has chosen a pot reminiscent of Boccaccio , but she is quite humorless and more than a little nasty .

		With art as the term is commonly understood , these novels have little connection .

		There is no life in them ; they do not aim to portray life .

		Their end is simply to appeal to the romantic side of us ; to make their marionette lovers dance for our amuse - ment .

		And who will say that they do not achieve their purpose ... Two books of melancholy interest are
The Whole Truth About Alcohol	ORGANIZATION	, by
George Elliott Flint	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and Beverages and Their Adultera - tion , by
Harvey W. Wiley	PERSON	-LRB-
Blakiston	LOCATION	;
Philadelphia	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		The former , though opposing prohibition , lacks the complete bartender 's guide which the temperate Mr.
Wiley	PERSON	eruditely incorporates into his book ; but it does stimulate the sad hope that there remain a few ancient spirits not outraged by the attitude of Horatius Flaccus : '' Nulla placere diu neo vivere carmina possunt quae scribuntur aquae potoribus . ''

		From
Philadelphia	LOCATION	comes the announcement that
George J. C. Grasberger	PERSON	is about to publish
Gabriel Sarrazin	PERSON	's essay on
Walt Whitman	PERSON	, as trans - lated by
Harrison S. Morris	PERSON	.

		The manuscript has been stored away somewhere ever since Whitman penned his own notes on the margins of the original sheets .

		Only one hundred copies of the new volume will be printed very attractively printed , if the preliminary broadside sets the standard and the proceeds of the enterprise will be used to purchase as a memorial the Whitman house in
Camden	LOCATION	.

June 28	DATE	Notes on New Books THE SECRET CITY .

		386 pages .

		Doran .

		By
Hugh Walpole	PERSON	. ''

		There is a secret city in every man 's heart , '' and it is the secret cities in the hearts of several Russians and Englishmen , living out their private tragedy in revolutionary
Petrograd	LOCATION	, that Mr.
Wal	PERSON	- pole explores .

		Durward , the Englishman who in - terpreted the drama staged in the '' dark forest '' at the Front , where
Semyonov	PERSON	and
Trenchard	PERSON	fought for the love of
Maria Ivanovna	PERSON	, is , in this sequel , the absorbed spectator of another drama .

		The dominating figure is still
Semyonov	PERSON	, the coldly diabolical sensualist and cynic , who strangely grows to resemble the Heathcliff of
Wuthering Heights	LOCATION	, in love with a ghost , passionately yearning to burst the barriers of the flesh and be united with the spirit of the dead woman .

		Unwilling to adopt the simple method of suicide which Russian fiction has made almost pleasantly familiar
Semyonov	PERSON	aims to ac - complish his liberation from the flesh by an elaborate plot involving the ingenious torture of poor Mark - ovich and the wrecked happiness of Vera and her lover
Lawrence	PERSON	, an English Sir
Galahad	PERSON	all to the end of forcing the tortured man to murder his tor - mentor .

		After several Dostoevsky-like scenes of hair - raising suspense , the murder is rather tamely accomplished .

		But it is really the secret '' city of the Russian soul that Mr.
Walpole	PERSON	seems most eager to explore , even though at times he turns around on himself and scoffs at his own discoveries .

		This task of in - terpretation was a little easier when the Russians were fighting for the Allies , and their mystic soul was supposed to be yearning towards the sacred city of Constantine .

		When it begins to yearn towards Bolshevism , it gives Mr.
Walpole	PERSON	-LRB- or Dur - ward -RRB- many a nightmare . ''

		The Russian lives in a world of loneliness peopled only by ideas ... accustomed from babyhood to bathe in an atmos - phere that deals only with ideas ...
Russia	LOCATION	moves always according to the Idea that governs her .

		.

		.

		The same face , the face of a baby , of a child , of a credulous , cynical dreamer , a face the kindest , the naivest , the cruellest , the most friendly , the most human , the most savage , the most
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	and the most Western in the world . ''

		Well !

		This business of seeing Russian psychology through Eng - lish eyes has no excuse , says
Durward	PERSON	, except that it is English .

		And the effort seems disastrous for Englishmen ; Durward and even young
Bohun	PERSON	arc subject to hallucinations , weird seizures , and visions .

		If this is the way Englishmen are upset by
Russia	LOCATION	, is that not another cogent reason for hoping they will withdraw ?

		One might criticize Mr.
Walpole	PERSON	for a frankly irrelevant eulogy of Sir
George Buchanan	PERSON	, did one not sympathize with his relief at rinding something he was sure of the perfection of the Ambassador .

		CESAR
NAPOLEON GAILLARD	PERSON	.

		By
Jean Farmer	PERSON	.

		392 pages .

		Payot et Cie. ;
Paris	LOCATION	.

		If the recent American interest in
France	LOCATION	has been productive of many volumes of compendious misinformation , an equal French interest in things American has been of even greater profit to the pub - lishing world .

		The latest Franco-American book is a picturesque novel ,
Cesar Napoleon Gaillard	PERSON	a la Conquete d'Amerique .

		The hero of the story is son of a staid functionary of
Montelimar	LOCATION	, city of Nougat .

		Rebel against the conservatism of
Gail	PERSON	- lard pere and of the Lyonnais manufacturers for whom he slaved , he emigrates to
New York	LOCATION	.

		There he is successively dishwasher , strikebreaker , and waiter ; piano player in a bagnio , circus rider , silk salesman , and finally confidential agent for
Upland & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, a prosperous firm of liquor dealers which M. Farmer evidently intends to be typical of all Ameri - can corporations .

		As is quite natural , the author
1919	DATE	THE DIAL 659 stresses throughout the story the differences between the two countries rather than their similarities .

		To believe him , all American hotels have
2000	DATE	rooms and
2000	DATE	baths while all French hostelries are tiny .

		He presents American business as gigantic , efficient and dishonest ; the typical American is a dashing , adventurous fellow who takes for motto '' Partout ou j' accroche mon chapeau , la est ma maison , mon foyer , mon doux foyer '' a not too exact
Gallici	PERSON	- zation of '' Any old place I hang my hat is home sweet home to me . ''

		On the other hand his typical Frenchman is fifty years behind the times and quite content to remain there .

		One gets no echo of the French talent for revolutionizing the world every once in a while , or of the fact that the
United States	LOCATION	is lagging politically behind most of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		This omission however does not interfere with one 's ap - preciation of M. Farmer 's otherwise keen observa - tion of American life , nor with one 's enjoyment of an adventure story extremely jolly , even if highly improbable .

		JIM , THE STORY OF A BACKWOODS POLICE DOG .

		By
Charles G. D. Roberts	PERSON	.

		216 pages .


Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	.

		Someone has offered this objection to animal stories , that the cleverest beast he ever read about was not quite so intelligent as the most stupid man .

		The indictment hardly holds true of
Jim	PERSON	, the hero of the first story in this collection , for his canine astuteness puts most of the human beings that surround him to shame , and is equaled only by that of the omniscient Tug
Blackstock	PERSON	, his master .

		Together they stalk evildoers , and loom up as figures of almost - legendary heroism against the familiar background of the
Canada	LOCATION	woods .

		In the remaining tales we encounter a more recent setting for animal stories , that of the trenches .

		One of the tales is concerned with the adventures of a shell-shocked mule ; another follows the flight of an eagle , released from his cage by an exploding 75 , who flies at a great height along the lines and receives a veritable bird 's - eye view of the war .

		These animals of which we read , despite epigrams to the contrary , are really much more interesting than human beings , and Major
Roberts	PERSON	rather spoils the impression by im - posing on them the purely human institution of a plot .

		This he omits to do in the last story .

		Stripes , the skunk who is its unconcerned hero , goes calmly about his business of catching field mice and sucking eggs , quite indifferent to the great beasts which sur - round him .

		Finally he is attacked by a very fool - ish bear cub , deluges it with slime , and falls a victim finally to its revengeful mother , who after slaying him with one blow of her paw , goes on about her business .

		It is all casual and cruel and very real ; it reminds one not so much of another animal story as of one of
Tchekhov	ORGANIZATION	's sketches or of an etching by
George Bellows	PERSON	.

		THE ROLL-CALL .

		By
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	.

		417 pages .

		Doran .

		In the Roll-Call Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	returns to his Five Towns material , projected into
London	LOCATION	in the person of
George Cannon	PERSON	, the son of
Hilda Less	PERSON	- ways .

		He returns also to the method of his Five Towns novels , departing from his swift impres - sionistic treatment of
London	LOCATION	in The Pretty Lady , in favor of a treatment at times so replete that it suggests the uninterrupted flow of uncritized con - sciousness .

		The book recounts the career of
George Cannon	ORGANIZATION	, articled pupil in the offices of a firm of successful
London	LOCATION	architects .

		He is , at the start , capable of being impressed because Mr.
Haim	PERSON	, the factotum of the firm , owns a house in
Chelsea	LOCATION	and will furnish him a lodging ; capable , too , of falling in love with Mr.
Haim	PERSON	's daughter , gentle unam - bitious
Margaret	PERSON	.

		He means , even then , to become a great architect .

		He attains that ambition with amazing velocity , through winning a competion for a town hall in the north of
England	LOCATION	, a competition he enters individually upon impulse furnished by
Lois Ingraham	PERSON	.

		Then as an architectural prodigy he marries the pleasure-ravenous
Lois	PERSON	, and spends ten years cashing in his fame while the town hall comes into physical existence .

		By that time the war is on .


George Cannon	PERSON	, still dissatisfied with his achievement , suddenly aware that there exist not only degrees of success but all kinds of success , lands two large architectural schemes : one a barracks in
India	LOCATION	; the other , munition factories in
England	LOCATION	.

		His assurance that he can best serve his country as an architect is shaken by the appearance of
Lucas	PERSON	, his brother-in-law , resplendent in an officer 's uni - form .

		After an uncomfortable dream in which a voice calls the roll and no one answers to the name of
George Edwin Cannon	PERSON	, he applies for a commis - sion .

		Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	leaves him , after a slight mili - tary experience at
Epson Downs	ORGANIZATION	, lying in a small tent , his feet in the rain , reflecting that there is something in this
Army	ORGANIZATION	business !

		The temper of Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	seems to be con - sistently sardonic until he reaches the final episode , in which his hero , lifted out of responsibility , is happy .


George Cannon	ORGANIZATION	moves through a kaleide - scopic multiplicity of scenes , from
Sunday	DATE	excursions and studio parties , through music halls , elaborate dinners , to the opening of his town hall , and even a military ^ shopping tour .

		Always Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	's treatment of this social background is deft and finished .

		At the Orgreave luncheon , '' Nothing in - teresting had been said , and little that was sincere .

		But everybody had behaved very well , and had demonstrated that he or she was familiar with the usages of society and with aspects of existence with which it was proper to be familiar . ''

		The dinner in the overwhelmingly splendid flat of
Irene Wheeler	PERSON	illustrates '' the great principle of con - spicuous ritualistic waste in a manner to satisfy the most exacting . ''

		The chromatic toilettes at the 66o THE DIAL
June 28 Longchamps Sunday	DATE	races have , in a stroke , '' malo - dorous workrooms , and the fatigue of pale , indus - trious creatures '' as their soil .

		The musical comedy in
London	LOCATION	to which Lois drags
George	PERSON	has its '' jocularity pivoted unendingly on the same twin centers of alcohol and concupiscence . ''

		All of Lon - don display , of
London	LOCATION	amusement , of
London	LOCATION	success has this treatment , clever , sharp , provocative .

		There are , on the other hand , scenes of definite , clear reality :
Margaret	PERSON	, designing book covers , Mrs.
Haim	PERSON	serving tea , scenes in which reality is evoked by the words .

		But for the most part the book is strident , highly seasoned .

		Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	insists upon the superlative qualities of objects and experiences to such an extent that he quickly fails to stimulate a jaded palate .

		He gives you , not the emotions of his hero , but a list of adjectives , miraculous , won - drous , supreme , sublime , ineffable , applied alike to motor bicycles , complexions , sex sensations , and cathedrals .

		The result is a sort of scenic brilliancy , a constant illumination as of too many electric signs , with almost never the remarkable daylight of The Old Wives ' Tale or Clayhanger .

		The
Roll-Call	ORGANIZATION	leaves the impression that Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	wrote so furiously that pages fluttered to the floor without intermission and that he had his tongue in his cheek as he heaped high-sounding adjectives above his adolescent hero .

		THE SONG OF THE SIRENS .

		By
Edward Lucas White	ORGANIZATION	.

		348 pages .

		Button .

		It would seem that the Freudian wish was father to the thought in a number of these tales .

		In a prefatory admission , the author chooses to step aside from the post of creative responsibility to a certain extent , and trace his plot-sources in dreams . ''

		Often , '' he says , '' I wake with the sensation of having just finished reading a book or story . ''

		And in the case of one of the tales included in this volume , he returned to consciousness '' with the last three sentences of it , word for word as they stand , '' branded on his sight .

		This is an interesting con - fession , and since there is no ethical point involved in frank plagiary from the v subconscious , we do not quarrel with the writer for making it .

		As a matter of fact the material filched from the unreal has as a rule been welded into far more skilful fiction than the tales which attempt to mirror ancient life by a parallel modern mood .

		The dream stories are authentic in a certain haunting terror , and in a baffling verisimilitude .

		They are not particularly pleasant tales , and there is at times a somewhat too bloody vigor in the transcription , but they achieve a definite effect .

		On the other hand , the stories which deal with ancient
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	are less dramatic , because they depend upon tedious stretches of '' small talk '' to supply the needed period-atmos - phere .

		Two Roman gentlemen discussing innova - tions in underwear hamper the early pages of The Skewbald Panther , and Caesar slinging cheap epithets does even greater damage in The Fasces .

		-LRB- Among
Caeser	PERSON	's choice mouthfuls , hurled at Crassus and Clodius , are : `` you yoke of asses , '' '' you bat-blind idiots , '' '' you nasty little tadpole , '' and '' you great scurfy toad . '' -RRB-

		* Despite academic definition the shortstory is al - ways spilling over its boundaries and invading the shadowy domains that separate it from the novel on one hand and the Elian essay on the other .

		All the professional disquisitors are agreed that this modern literary form must embody a plot and achieve in exposition the coherence of brevity ; but not until the shortstory is as dead as the sophistic oration may one reasonably expect it to follow the orthodox pre - scriptions .

		Mrs.
Galsworthy	PERSON	's translation of certain Maupassant stories , a work done well enough to appear now in a fourth edition , shows plainly that at the very sources of its inspiration the shortstory was a thing of uneven mood and measure .

		Yvette is almost big enough to occupy comfortably the broad-acred pages of the
Saturday	DATE	Evening Post ; A Duel is small enough to run as a one-column filler in a newspaper .

		In one story you have a complete plot woven in varicolored threads of place and cir - cumstance ; in the other , a small sample of uniform color and texture , snipped out of the plaid fabric of life .

		Since the shortstory does not conform to a single pattern in the hands of a Frenchman and a master , it is futile to look for any closer approximation to the academic ideal even in well-schooled
America	LOCATION	.

		If
Newton Fuessle	ORGANIZATION	's collection gives one no other assurance , it at least gives one this , for with respect to form he ranges from the synoptic narrative of the Million Heir to the fleeting , sidewalk impression of Ten Minutes After Six .

		About the style and con - tents of Mr.
Fuessle	PERSON	's tales there is little to be said that was not applicable also to his recent novel .

		The world of flesh he describes with a photographic accuracy which is occasionally blurred by a desperate endeavor , untinged by inspiration , to escape the hackneyed in metaphor ; but the world of the spirit seems rather beyond his comprehension , and the touch of phantasy one finds in the title does not enliven the tales themselves .

		As far as our formal thesis is concerned the trans - lation of
Pinski	PERSON	's stories of temptation brings only further proof. , But the stories themselves tempt one to forget the thesis : they have the same sharp , national savor that salted the plays and stories of

Kate Jordan	PERSON	.

		348 pages .

		Little ,
Brown	PERSON	;
Boston	LOCATION	.

		They are no light fiction for light readers , these two books ; no hammock novels , no anodynes .

		Their authors have each chosen for chief character a young person struggling against the world with uncertain success :
Kate Jordan	PERSON	takes a
Georgia	LOCATION	Cracker girl ;
Ted Robbins	PERSON	a fisherman 's son from a
Long Island	LOCATION	village .

		Both authors are evidently and sincerely trying to write a very good novel ; if they have not succeeded , that fact is not to be held too strongly against them .

		In the case of Mr.
Robbins	PERSON	, the failure is hardly due to his theme .

		His idea of frustrated genius , of a poet defeated by the very circumstances that have produced him , is worthy of a much better book than he has written .

		One decides in the end that Red of Surley fails because its hero , as a man of talent , is unconvincing ; only as the skipper of a fishing schooner does he seem real .

		In explanation one can only say that it takes genius to portray genius .

		If Red
Hurley	PERSON	did not reach his goal , it was for a lack of that special ` sort of education required by the literary man , and of this his creator himself has none too much .

		Miss
Jordan	PERSON	has not attempted so much and has accomplished more .

		What the heroine of Against the Winds asks of life is not fame ; she requires only a decent living and her share of happiness .

		To at - tain these she marries , but a drunken husband fails to supply them .

		Nature abhors a vacuum ; the lover steps in ; and since
Miss Jordan	PERSON	is quite moral , cancer and the war are the means to a happy existence promised faintly in the last chapter .

		The author 's philosophy of life compounded of elementary so - ciology , Presbyterianism , and a reading of
William J. Locke	PERSON	does not make for great or lasting work .

		But her skill in the business of writing , like Mr.
Robbins	PERSON	' determination not to compromise with reality , promises something better in the future .

		MIDAS AND SON .

		By
Stephen McKenna	PERSON	.

		Do ran .

		Sir
Aylmer Lancing	PERSON	is One of Our Conquerors .

		America has given him his opportunity and he rides on the floodtide of fortune to fabulous riches ; but at the crest of endeavor Lancing falls a victim to the law of compensation , and he returns to his native land a physical wreck , with nothing to absorb his intelligence but the disposition of his riches and the career of his only son ,
Deryk	PERSON	.

		The stubborn will and unceasing nervous activity of Sir
Aylmer	PERSON	are reproduced in his offspring .

		And the tragedy of Midas and Son is not , as the publishers inform one , the tragedy of wealth , but the tragedy of similar temperaments , whose very power to mold others only intensifies their mutual incompatibility .

		Sir
Aylmer	PERSON	very much like his Victorian predecessor , Sir
Austin Feverel	PERSON	maintains an inscrutable watchful - ness over his son 's goings and comings , and he is enough of an invalid to let this solicitude break forth into open control .


Idina	PERSON	is the Lucy of this modern tragedy , and it is over the fond , clinging form of
Idina	PERSON	that both
Midas	LOCATION	and Son finally stumble to grief .

		Sir
Midas	PERSON	dies , for all his riches , estranged from his son ; and
Midas Junior	ORGANIZATION	inflicts death on himself , for all his erstwhile love , estranged from the world .

		The
England	LOCATION	one samples in
Midas	LOCATION	and Son is but the thin upper crust of leisured and titled folk , the very icing of society .

		It is the same
England	LOCATION	, if one neglects the slight advance toward Elizabethan candor , that
Meredith	PERSON	depicted a generation ago , and
Miss Austen	PERSON	a whole century ago .

		In Sonia Mr.
McKenna	PERSON	described this par - ticular stratum of English society buckling and twisting under the pressure of war .

		If the conflict had effected any - fundamental changes in the social scene , it is obvious that the author would not have been able to write another book without changing either his location , his interests , or his characters .

		In the very breath that the Webbs and Wellses are proclaiming that
Midas	LOCATION	and Son are dead , and that the new social order has arrived , it is hardly reassur - ing to see Mr.
McKenna	PERSON	throw his hat in the air and shout '' Long Live Midas and Son . ''

		Really , the war should have changed all that , unless
Midas	LOCATION	and Son is a fictional contribution to ancient history .

June 28	DATE	it acquires more critical point when taken in con - nection with another caustic reflection from the same pen , easily applicable to this author , `` What ?

		A great man ?

		I always see merely the play-actor of his own ideal . ''

		In the present volume an ob - servant and healthy cynical reader will discover rather a superfluity of grimacing and play-acting , however well and fluently done .

		This is not to say that The Flame of Life is an inexcusably mediocre thing , or that its fault lies in offending the moral sensibilities of Anglo-Saxons .

		Indeed this latter is rather a salutary a criticism of the Anglo-Saxon 's im - penetrable puritanism , which recoils in fatuous alarm from every over-bold hint that life is con - ditioned by the senses .

		The Flame of Life merely insists on this ageless commonplace , and if the result is frequently puerile and wearisome to those who are no longer mentally adolescent , it is also accompanied by an indisputable fervor , subtlety , and an occasional flash of profound insight worthy of a more sub - stantial setting .

		It is especially to be noted that
D'Annunzio	PERSON	is a thorough expert in what might be called borderline states of consciousness : he is eternally on the watch for those inconceivably deli - cate waves of impressions transmitted to the mind by all forms , animate and inanimate , whose absorp - tion and accurate re-embodiment in words consti - tutes one of the gravest responsibilities of the artist , in whatever medium ' he works .

		In the present volume there is just a trifle too much of '' the lust of the eye , '' and many readers will question whether
D'Annunzio	PERSON	has really proved to them to use his own words '' how , in order to obtain victory over man and circumstance , there is no other way but that of constantly feeding one 's own exaltation and magnifying one 's own dream of beauty or of power . ''

		By the use solely of interweav - ing letters and two explanatory diary extracts , he has caused no less than sixteen interesting person - ages to play an international comedy which realizes several highly amusing situations .

		Unfortunately this plot is coated with a charm , a sentiment , a
Kentucky	LOCATION	whimsicality which cloys a little .

		Mr.
Allen	PERSON	, after all , is not a true romancer any more than certain benign and agreeable elderly clergy - men are .

		Like them , instead of creating a new and wonderful world , he merely paints a thin gloss over the actual trusting all the time to certain market-tested colors .

		This clerical similarity extends , perhaps it may be added , to the causing of a slight monotony to the reader .

		WHY JOAN ?

		By
Eleanor Marcein Kelly	PERSON	.

		407 pages .

		Century .

		Novelists attempting character studies should make sure first that they have climbed somewhat above the level of the people in the story and then that they manipulate a powerful enough searchlight to throw illuminating flashes on the helpless figures below .

		As a searchlight operator Mrs.
Kelly	PERSON	does not inspire .

		She shows us environments handily enough , but never does she focus clearly on the central figure ,
Joan	PERSON	.

		In the uncertain light
Joan	PERSON	is an expectant mediocrity drifting through various stages husband hunting ,
Louisville	LOCATION	society , domes - ticity , suffrage work , war nursing until finally she becomes an author -LRB- the reader somehow would not care to read her writings -RRB- .

		Yet there is evidence that
Joan	PERSON	was intended to be an altogether different girl to attain at last through love and suffering to real self-expression .

		Likewise there is reason for a hope that Mrs - .

		Kelly may do better next time .

Lee	PERSON	and
Shepard	PERSON	;
Boston	LOCATION	.

		Time was when the good and the pleasant were two separate categories in the literature of youth .

		Boys with appetites for adventure were dieted on specially prepared stuff that offered little prigs and pious precepts in place of strong men and the urge of human desires .

		The importation of
Diamond Dick	ORGANIZATION	into the garret was a protest against the regime of Percy in the parlor .

		Mr.
Mathiews	PERSON	' collection of stories is a protest too , prepared in the full knowledge that every great motive that moves men to action will likewise stir the ambition of a boy .

		It is precisely because these stories were written for a human audience rather than for a child audience that their authors -LRB- Mark Twain ,
O. Henry	PERSON	, Nor - man
Duncan	PERSON	, and the rest -RRB- escape that air of con - descension which still lingers in the brief introduc - tion .

		If youth looks forward toward rough realities , childhood is busy with fancies born of the mysterious past .

		Because of the inherent validity of the com - mon distinction between child psychology and the adult habit of mind ,
Miss Smith	PERSON	is not called upon to make excursions beyond the field of juvenile literature in her search for Good Old Stories for Boys and Girls stories by such authors as Ingelow ,
Ruskin	PERSON	,
Bjornson	PERSON	, and
Browning	PERSON	.

		Her volume gathers conveniently between two covers not a few of the classics which live on to rebuke the shallow smartness and insolent patronage of contemporary writing for children .

		The wise parent will appre - ciate this service .

		Further introductions are promised from
Arthur Pinero	PERSON	,
G. K. Chesterton	PERSON	,
Granville Barker	PERSON	,

		The edition , limited to 1500 sets , is beautifully printed and bound .

		These novels were reviewed in
Ruth Mclntire	PERSON	's essay , An Imperturable Artist , in THE DIAL for
June 6 , 1918	DATE	.

		The Little Daughter of
Jerusalem	LOCATION	, by
Myriam Harry	PERSON	-LRB- 289 pages ; Button -RRB- , casts the author 's own girl - hood into the molds of fiction , and vividly depicts the kaleidoscopic contrasts of life in the
Holy City	LOCATION	.

		The narrative is marked by impressionability and keen observation , and renders something of the inner development of a highly imaginative child , be - wildered amid the incongruities of many religions and diverse races .

		The Born Fool , by
John Walter Byrd	PERSON	-LRB- 448 pages ; Boran -RRB- , is a detailed story of character development , written with poetic appreciation .

		One of those leisurely , well-knit English novels which delight the imaginative reader , but irritate those who regard speed and action as the cardinal principles of the art of fiction .

		Our Wonderful Selves , a novel by Roll and
Pertwee	PERSON	-LRB- 349 pages ; Knopf -RRB- , is the biography of an individualist .

		Here evidently is an attempt to get at those qualities of mind which differentiate the independent spirit from the conformer .

		But Mr.
Pertwee	PERSON	's study is superficial ; it has scope for little beyond the stig - mata of genius , and his zest for outwardness as opposed to inwardness of action has tripped him into writing a story which , if very readable , is by no means significant .

		The Convictions of
Christopher Sterling	PERSON	, by
Harold Beg	PERSON	- bie -LRB- 267 pages ;
McBride	PERSON	-RRB- , attempts impartially '' to set forth the antithetical ideals of nationalism and religion '' in war time .

		The climax of the story is the mistreatment of religious conscientious objectors in the English prisons .

		As fiction it is awkwardly written , but as a social document it is not without interest .

		The Two Crossings of
Madge Swalue	PERSON	, by
Henri Bavig	PERSON	- non -LRB- 330 pages ; Lane -RRB- , commends itself above the general run of war fiction by a welcome restraint and a freedom from hysteria .

		The narrative is French in its lean crispness ; and the translation , made by
Tita Brand Cammaerts	ORGANIZATION	, has lost none of its strength through attempts at fine writing .

		The Yellow Lord , by `` Will Levington Comfort -LRB- 311 pages ; Boran -RRB- , a romance of adventure and love in the Orient , borrows the Conrard manner and achieves something like a Conrad atmosphere .

		But the action outruns character and it remains a yarn , if a very readable one .

		All the
Brothers Were Valiant	ORGANIZATION	, by
Ben Ames Williams	PERSON	-LRB- 204 pages ;
Macmillan	PERSON	-RRB- , is a tale of a whaler , written much as
Morgan Robertson	PERSON	might have writ - ten it that is , for
summer	DATE	consumption .

		In Secret , by
Robert W. Chambers	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- 322 pages ; Boran -RRB- , is arn easy-running narrative in the best quantitative style .

		The heroine proves herself a worthy Cham - bers creation when she disrobes to swim a stream and carry cartridges to her embattled lover .

		The war perhaps accounts for the omission of the cus - tomary illustrations ; but the introduction of German intrigue produces little dilution in the rich essence of the author 's customary theme .

		Red
Friday	DATE	, by
George Kibbe Turner	PERSON	-LRB- 253 pages ; Little ,
Brown	PERSON	-RRB- , is not a novel to temper the cheerless moods of Blue
Monday	DATE	.

		It purports to forecast graphically what might happen in the
United States	LOCATION	should Bolshevist conspirators gain the upper hand , and it therefore deserves to be bound with those fairy stories for the feebleminded which described what took place when a million Huns invaded
New York	LOCATION	.

		Anymoon , by
Horace Bleackley	PERSON	-LRB- 327 pages ; Lane -RRB- , is an unbeliever 's attempt to picture the world under So - cialism , but it will give the internationalists no sleep - less nights .

		Instead of shattering Socialist fundamen - tals , it merely ' succeeds in shattering art fundamentals in the writing of fiction .

		Wolves , by
Alden W. Welch	PERSON	-LRB- 236 pages ; Knopf -RRB- , a first novel , written about engineers by an engineer , is unsentimental ; but it is so far short of distinction that the reader will wish the author knew less about en - gineeering and more about fiction .

		The Mystery Keepers , by
Marion Fox	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- 315 pages ; Lane -RRB- , represents a somewhat involved handling of what proves in the last chapter to be '' hereditary hys - ' teria . ''

		It depends solely upon mystery to retain at - tention and sometimes fails to sustain even this ele - ment .

		The Great Modern English Stories , compiled and edited with an introduction by
Edward J. O'Brien	PERSON	-LRB- 366 pages ;
Boni & Liveriglit	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is the second in a series of short-story anthologies of which
Willard Hunting	ORGANIZATION	-
don Wright	PERSON	's Great Modern French Stories was the first .

		Few of these tales are unfamiliar or inacessible , and not all of them are `` great '' ; but the volume , which concludes with biographies and bibliographies , will be found more convenient than most collections of the kind by those who have use for the kind .

		Winesburg ,
Ohio	LOCATION	: Tales of
Ohio Small Town Life	ORGANIZATION	, by
Sherwood Anderson	PERSON	-LRB- 303 pages ;
Huebsch	PERSON	-RRB- , is a prose Spoon River Anthology .

		Acridly written , these in - terrelated studies of half-articulate people who do not know what they want deal more often than not with the pathological , but they deal understandingly and honestly .

		The book introduces to us a new
Theodore Roosevelt	PERSON	, totally unsuspected by the majority of his admirers .

		It is a fascinating attempt to apply the science of psycho-analysis to a great contemporary .

		In a striking introduction , entitled '' Apologia Pro
Vita Sua	PERSON	, '' Mr.
Viereck	PERSON	portrays with biting sarcasm and withering scorn , his persecution during the period of the war .

		His brilliant portrait of
America	LOCATION	in war time is one of the documents that will furnish food for thought to the historian of the future .

		BENEDICT ARNOLD THE FIRST BRITISH PROPAGANDIST In spite of its name , Mr.
Viereck	PERSON	's preface is not an apology , but an indictment .

		The
New Book of Martyrs	ORGANIZATION	, by
Georges Duhamel	PERSON	-LRB- 221 pages ;
Doran	PERSON	-RRB- , comprises a series of hospital sketches , reflecting the bravery of nameless heroes of the French front .

		It seeks to probe below the surface of mere stoic suffering and appraise spiritual values , but Dr.
Duhamel	PERSON	has come near to defeating his pur - pose by adhering too closely to surgical detail .

		The pages exhale iodoform .

		The Fledgling , by
Charles Bernard Nordhoff	PERSON	-LRB- 201 pages ; Houghton-Mifflin -RRB- , will perhaps be accepted by men who fly as the truest thing yet written about flying .

		Others should be warned that the author 's classicism is of the neo-pseudo-bluestocking variety , that his spirit is that of the smuggest puritanism -LRB- his favorite word is `` decorum '' -RRB- , and that his scholarship is the one-sided erudition of doctrinaire propaganda .
