		BRIEFER MENTION 20 NOTES 21 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 21 THE JAUNDICED EYE .

		It has long been the fashion for writers of our English race , from the vantage-ground of a conservatism assumed -LRB- without very close in - quiry -RRB- as our peculiar birthright , to speak in slighting or scornful terms of the fickleness of the multitude as exemplified in the history of other peoples .

		Ancient Athenians and modern Frenchmen have served alike to point the moral , and the study of their history gives repeated warning of the dangers that flow from instability of purpose .

		It is only the firmly-anchored char - acter that may withstand the tempests of passion .

		and hold to its moorings despite the angry onset of winds and waves .

		There is much , indeed , in the recorded experience of both
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	to warrant our complacency in this respect , and we have achieved many victories of civilization in peaceful ways when a more tur - bident stock would have thought bloodshed the necessary accompaniment and consecration .

		But a nation , no less than an individual , has a character that is subject to modifications , and these modifications , insensible in their daily or yearly effect , may in time come to acquire a cumulative impetus that will prove formidable , and will threaten what have hitherto been thought to be the very bulwarks of the nation 's life .

		Principles and ideals that have stood in seeming integrity for generations may succumb to corrosive influences that have been working upon them in silence and concealment until the column has become a shell and the corner-stone a honeycomb .

		We had some startling revela - tions in this sense a few years ago , when we discovered that the Declaration of Independence was to be held as naught in the presence of the opportunity to subjugate a foreign people , and that the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	had suffered a sea - change , being transformed from a statement of mutual international obligations into an arrogant pronouncement of national selfishness .

		With these and other developments of recent years in mind , we may hardly lay to our soids the flat - tering unction that we are immune to the temptations that lead other nations into the paths of vainglorious folly .

		Colonel
Higginson	PERSON	once informed us that the possession of an added drop of nervous fluid marked our national differentiation from the parent stock , and made us a superior people .

		We may admit the added element without being altogether sure that its physiological action is for good .

		There are some indications , in fact , that it makes for instability and bad temper and irrational conduct .

		If we are lacking in the power to see life steadily and see it whole , to that extent we become prone to prejudice and deaf to the counsels of sobriety .

		And grave problems are pressing upon us , quite as grave as any we have faced in the past , which demand for their solution the unprejudiced outlook and the sober judgment .

		We are called upon to 6 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, grapple with corruption in business and politics , with social injustice , and with the ethical an - archy that attends the breaking up of outworn religious systems .

		To work regeneration in these departments of activity is our twentieth - century task , and it is as big a task as we have ever been called upon to undertake .

		Our chief danger will be found in the spirit of recklessness , for the eagerness of unbalanced reformers for immediate residts is likely to destroy the good with the bad , and to set back our civilization in the very name of progress .

		A foreigner who should judge us by our news - papers , and especially by such of our newspapers as have the largest circidation , would be bound to set us down as one of the most emotional of peoples in our dealings with the graver issues of life .

		The success of those journals is so clearly due to their sensational appeal , their cheap sentimentalism , and their flattery of the mob , that it becomes pertinent to ask if they have not gauged their public with a fair degree of discernment .

		This impression finds further emphasis in the very marked recent tendency of our weekly and monthly periodicals to aban - don their old-time traditional dignity and copy the sensation-mongering methods of the daily press .

		And when we find the novelists marking out their course upon the same lines , we may feel pretty sure that a new social force is at work , likely in the long run to have very con - siderable consequences .

		It is of the novelists that we wish particularly to speak , for so many of them have turned tractarian of late that the most fetching title is nowadays more likely than not to label some social nostrum or other , or to return an indict - ment of some phase of our national life , or to preach , with hardly an effort to disguise it , some new doctrinaire gospel .

		An excellent example is Mr.
Herbert Quick	PERSON	's '' The Broken Lance , '' which keeps within the lines of legitimate fiction until the reader is fairly committed , and then becomes an exhibition of the peculiar form of monomania known to readers of single-tax liter - ature .

		The adoption of a new form of taxation is to prove the panacea for all the ills of society ; and those ills , of course , are skilf idly aggravated to make the application of the remedy seem the more urgent .

		Another illustration is found in '' The Convert , '' by Miss
Elizabeth Robins	PERSON	, who finds the primal source of all wrong -LRB- as far as women is concerned -RRB- in the fact that the strong and selfish sex insists upon keeping political rights within its own control .

		The exploitation of dishonesty in business and financial affairs -LRB- with the strong implication that nothing but dishonesty is to be found in those quarters -RRB- has now for several years been a favorite theme of the novelists , who explain the inner workings of bank and railway and insurance corporations , of market manipulators , and of industrial establishments , with a thorough - ness that quite convinces the average reader that the real thing is under his observation .

		It is particularly noble of these novelists thus to waste themselves upon precept when they might be enjoyed in practice , for even the profits accruing from a '' best seller '' are trifling in comparison with the profits of the enterprises under their con - sideration , and it is quite evident that commercial success would be in their grasp if only they cared to reach for it .

		No one so familiar with the ways of thievery could fail to hold his own in the game of wits which these writers assume all business to be .

		Political corruption is another hard-worked theme of these reformers by example .

		Their method , with slight variations , is to show us the successful politician surrounded by his hench - men , and , by means of intimidation or bribery , holding the public in the hollow of his hand .

		When this picture is drawn in detail , the modern
David	PERSON	appears upon the scene , and the pebble from his sling does the rest .

		Goliath is laid low , and the situation receives peculiar piquancy if he has a daughter whom
David	PERSON	loves .

		The federal judge -LRB- who is in reality the most inde - pendent official in our entire system -RRB- is a favor - ite victim of the sort of novel now in question , and the villainy which his mask of dignity con - ceals is relentlessly exposed .

		All this muck-raking has two unfortunate consequences .

		It presents as a whole a picture of our national life that is absolutely untypical , however exactly an occasional instance may exemplify it .

		The foreign observer , reading of this welter of corruption and crime in which our novelists so delightedly plimge us , get an impression as false as that which we , for exam - ple , get of French life from the study of modem French fiction .

		Taking a more practical view of this consequence , it may be remarked that the foreigner , reading a lurid account of our meat-packing industry , renounces our steaks and sausages ; reading of our insurance `` graft - ers , '' he cancels his policies in American com - panies ; and reading of our piratical railway fmanciers , he dumps his stocks on the market .

		The other consequence , and the more serious of the two , is that the novelists who thus lend themselves to sensationalism are deliberately
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL putting themselves into alliance with the yellow journalism which is our chief national disgrace , and are fomenting the evil passions of greed and envy which already show ominous signs of breaking bounds and sweeping away the old landmarks of law and justice .

		If we can not exhibit more restraint , even in our popular literature , than we have shown of late , we may as well give up our pretension of superior national poise and sobriety .

		Impulse and recklessness could not much further go than we have already allowed them to go in the late onslaught upon our social system .

		Under the specious plea of attacking privilege , funda - mental right is being assailed on every hand , to say nothing of the many special assaults upon individualism .

		The tyranny of the majority , of which
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	made such dire prophecies , gets worse and worse , and every ex - tension of this despotism is made in the name of philanthropy .

		But , as
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	said , and
Emerson	PERSON	long before him , all these things * aimed at by half-educated reformers are the merest externals , and could accomplish , even were they turned in the right direction , no real regeneration . ''

		I do not wish to remove from my present prison to a prison a little larger , '' said
Emerson	PERSON	, '' I wish to break all prisons . ''

		There is nothing that we more need as a nation than a stout reaffirmation of the first principles of individualism , a substitution of clear vision for the present jaundiced gaze of too many among us , and a new realization of the fact that reforms made by precipitation or violence are apt to cost more than they are worth .

		THE T WO W ORLDS .

		Has anyone ever made a census of the beings born of words -- counted the population of that kingdom of the imagination which hovers above our heads in air , or invisibly occupies the spaces of the earth ?

		A '' Who 's Who '' of the gods and godesses , heroes and heroines , villains and merrymen of literatme , would be a huge affair .

		All the Mythological Dictionaries , all the lists of folk-lore creations , would have to be emptied into it .

		All the inhab - itants of
Playland	LOCATION	and
Poemland	LOCATION	and
Novelland	ORGANIZATION	would have to be mustered and marshalled in its pages .

		To the ordinary well-read man , the world of fiction is like the sky on a clear night .

		A few thousand bright stars are visible , while countless others are unseen or show only in the congregated gleam of the Milky Way .

		One curious result of such an enumeration would be to reveal that in some directions the people of fancy overcount reality .

		It is safe to say that there are two thousand novels published and plays brought out in
England	LOCATION	every year .

		It is also reasonable to estimate that each one of these productions con - tains , on an average , two members of the nobility among its characters .

		This would be more than ten times the membership of the
House of Lords	ORGANIZATION	.

		And as the Active creation of titles has been going on for generations , the actual holders of hereditary honors in
England	LOCATION	must have been overwritten many hundred times deep .

		England would have to be enlarged to the size of
Africa	LOCATION	, to hold all the estates the wizards of the pen have crowded into it .

		And the great poets , artists , soldiers , statesmen , and financiers who have been projected by the literary imagination would make a population for a consider - able city .

		The shining ones of life are the favorites of fiction , and every real personage of this kind must go attended by a crowd of airy phantoms of himself , whereas the average or less than average citizen has not one chance in ten thousand of being confronted by his ghost-like similar .

		It is impossible really to separate the creations of the Historical Muse from those of her more imagina - tive sisters .

		Clio wears the same clothes and uses the same instrument of expression as
Melpomene	ORGANIZATION	or Erato .

		They all depend on words to convince or inspire mankind .

		We say , indeed , that history is true and literature is fiction ; but in the first place this is a large and unestablished claim ; and in the second place , literature , being as a rule wrought by the g ^ `` eater hands , makes a deeper and more lasting impression on us .

		Achilles is more dazzlingly splen - did than
Alexander	PERSON	; Trimalchio is more real than
Tiberius	PERSON	.

		But the two forms of human record are everlastingly confused .

		Fiction deals largely with the personages and facts of history , and history borrows the interpretive and dramatic devices of lit - erature .

		Historic evidence , indeed , is hardly more than a jest .

		That certain incidents occurred and certain people lived in the past is sure ; but the causes and details of those incidents and the motives and personalities of those actors are wrapped in obscurity and open to the interpretation of every new historian .

		Literature is defined as an imitation of life , and its world is usually conceived as a sort of a mirage of reality .

		In recent times , the nearer it can get to the prose and placidness of ordinary life , the better it is thought to succeed .

		But even in the hands of the most accomplished apostle of ennui , literature , by reason of its necessary concentration and selectiveness , is different from life .

		It is life reflected in the medium of a single artist 's brain -- colored by his moods , changed by his passions and prejudices , charged with the impressions of all he has learned of the past , imitative of the work of preceding artists .

		Books beget books , and char - acters create characters .

		The Poor
Parson	ORGANIZATION	in
Chaucer	LOCATION	, Fielding 's
Parson Adams	PERSON	, the Vicar of
Wakefield	LOCATION	, My
Uncle Toby	ORGANIZATION	,
Dominie Sampson	PERSON	, and Mr.
Pickwick	PERSON	are in lineal descent .

		No two writers give us the report of the same life in the same way .

		8 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, French life as depicted by Hugo and
Dumas	PERSON	is a contradiction , a destroying contrast .

		The
New England	LOCATION	scenes of
Hawthorne	LOCATION	and of Mrs.
Freeman	PERSON	are equally things apart .

		Literature surely depends more upon the author 's gift of vision , his inner per - sonality , and his skill in language , than it does upon the raw materials of nature and humanity upon which he works .

		Real life , indeed , is hardly more than the peg upon which he hangs the draperies of his thought .

		It follows that the laws of real life are inappli - cable to literature .

		I do not mean by * ' laws '' the actual possibilities and certain consequences of human action , -- though literature can transgress those also , -- but the rules and conventions of good behavior .

		Spenser passes for a moral poet , but he draws the picture of a sensual paradise which if it could be realized in our midst would be shut up by the police .

		Sophocles is the most noble-minded of the Greeks , but in his -LRB- Edipus he tells a story so shocking that it could hardly be whispered about in ordinary con - versation .

		The peculiar sphere of literature , indeed , is the outrS , the violent , the exceptional , the unre - strained .

		It deals by preference with passions , vices , crimes , which we try to restrain in real life .

		And it pictures these in the most vivid way , isolating and toning up to them ; whereas in life they are so largely diluted with commonplace as to be hardly noticed .

		Of course , literature also deals with the noble and the virtuous side of life , and perhaps this side is the corrective of the other .

		But if it obeyed the laws we draw up to guide life , it would deal with good alone .

		Yet in the larger view I do not believe its exploitation of evil does any harm .

		An imaginative boy will go through a course of reading in English literature , -- will follow the fortunes of the rakes and roues of Elizabethan and Restoration comedy , will take purses with
Claude Duval	PERSON	and gallop the roads with
Dick Turpin	PERSON	, -- and come through the ordeal more pure and honest than an unlettered youth who has only known the expe - riences of practical life .

		The imaginative boy has common-sense .

		He does not take the apparitions of fancy for the solid appearances of the world .

		We all need stimulus and intoxication , and when we can get these things from literature we can largely dis - pense with them in life .

		The whole domain of fairy-tale , folk-lore , mythological legend , and outrS invention , is a play or game of mankind by which it tries to divert its mind from its cares and dul - nesses .

		It is a make-believe by which it seeks to impose on its own credulity an impossible ideal of its own power and achievements .

		Yet the action and reaction of life and literature are as sure as the tides .

		Sometimes life , by means of dsemonically gifted personages or overwhelmmg successions or combinations of events , draws litera - ture after it , -- makes poets its slavish and usually insignificant copyists .

		Sometimes great figures , tre - mendous actions , are projected , `` all made out of the
Carver	PERSON	's brain , '' and influence men at once or perennially .

		Men like Pericles , or
Augustus	LOCATION	, or
Louis XIV	ORGANIZATION	.

		impose themselves on literature , dictate the tastes and forms which the artists must follow .

		Women like Cleopatra , or
Mary Queen	PERSON	of Scots , carry after them a still longer train of poet-worship - pers .

		Great events like the Persian War , the con - quests of
Caesar	LOCATION	, or the Crucifixion , employ the pens of multitudes .

		On the other hand , great embodi - ments of humanity risen from some unknown depth of dreaming thought -- Job , Prometheus ,
Don Quixote	PERSON	,
Hamlet	LOCATION	, to name no others , -- create action in their turn , become bone of the bone , flesh of the flesh of the world .

		Werther , a projection of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's per - sonality , swept half
Germany	LOCATION	off its feet by its revolt and sentimentality .

		And it is impossible to say how much the spirit of
Napoleon	LOCATION	, and hence the fates of nations , was influenced by
Macpherson	ORGANIZATION	's Ossian .

		Of course , if we accept the dictum , which is at the root of modern science and philosophy , that `` there is nothing in the mind but what the senses put there , '' we must refer the creations of the mind back to experience , and so make literature and life one .

		But the dictum is not true .

		The eternal laws of thought are in the mind , and the germs of origination and difference .

		If this were not so , all minds would be pretty much alike ; for they all go through pretty much the same experience .

		Is literature , then , a creation ?


M. Rodin	PERSON	, the great French sculptor -- I do not say realistic sculptor , for he is too universal for such a label -- brushes the idea aside with the remark that '' none but fools imagine we create . ''

		Is that so ?

		There is
M. Rodin	PERSON	's
Balzac	LOCATION	.

		Without denying its power , all opinion asserts that the statue is not like
Balzac	LOCATION	, or anybody else .

		For any resemblance to reality ,
M. Rodin	PERSON	might just as well have carved a chimera or a snark .

		If , then , a man produces something which was never in the world before , and which but for him would never have existed , is it not very near to our idea of creation ?

		Art springs from the marriage of experience and revery .

		It is true that if a man goes on copying and reproducing the work of past artists , his efforts will lack that freshness and newness which are the signs of creative work .

		But he will also lose this freshness and newness if he copies , without inspiration , the frail , dull figures of humanity .

		To my mind ,
M. Rodin	PERSON	's statues are the most ideal of modern times -- - the ones most informed with thought , inspired beyond the semblance of life .

		I am disposed to think that the highest kind of creative intellect does not allow itself to be much dis - turbed by reality .

		The man himself may be pitch - forked into all kinds of action , but he does not take experience greedily or readily .

		A few forms or movements of life he seizes upon , and with these he retires into his cave , and , brooding over them -- aerating them with his own imaginations , twisting and twining them into a thousand shapes -- he finally produces the new thing which we recognize as the work of genius .

		Solitude is the prerequisite for all great work .

		It is only the warrior who sulks in his tent who can turn the tide of battle with a single shout .

		THE DIAL CASUAL COMMENT .

		An
English Hall of Fame	ORGANIZATION	now threatens to cause as much discussion and fault-finding as has the similar temple to renown in this comitry .

		The dome of the re-decorated and recently re-opened British Museum reading-room is divided into twenty spaces , of which a clock occupies one , while to the nineteen others are assigned nineteen names -- '' the greatest and most representative in English literature '' -- chosen by the Museum trustees .

		The names raised to lasting honor in that stately dome are -- Chaucer ,
Caxton	ORGANIZATION	,
Tindale	PERSON	,
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Bacon	LOCATION	,
Milton	LOCATION	,
Locke	PERSON	,
Addison	PERSON	, Swift ,
Pope	LOCATION	,
Gibbon	PERSON	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Scott	PERSON	,
Byron	PERSON	,
Carlyle	LOCATION	,
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	,
Tennyson	LOCATION	, and
Browning	PERSON	.

		Glaring omissions will at once be noted by everyone , but no two amended lists will exactly agree .

		In general , the exclusion of novelists will excite comment and criticism .

		Scott , to be sure , is snatched from oblivion ; but only because he wrote some excellent poetry before he produced still better prose .

		The trustees regard fiction as '' less import - ant than anj - ^ other branch of literary art . ''

		Exemplary Britons !

		Tindale and
Locke	PERSON	and
Addison	PERSON	are duly grate - ful : before a bench of judges more appreciative of the flower of imaginative literature their claims might have suffered .

		But even counting out Fielding ,
Dickens	PERSON	, and
Thackeray	PERSON	, we note with some surprise and regret the absence of
Goldsmith	LOCATION	,
Johnson	PERSON	,
Burns	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	, and
Keats	PERSON	, not to speak of
Dryden	ORGANIZATION	,
Bunyan	PERSON	,
Burke	PERSON	, and
Ruskin	PERSON	.

		Still , we are thankful , on the whole , that the responsibility of selecting the nineteen greatest names in English literature was not placed upon our shoulders .

		• • •
Whittier	LOCATION	relics at
Haverhill	LOCATION	were on exhibition in abimdance at the celebration there of his hundredth birthday ; but the most interesting display of
Whittierana	LOCATION	was at the public library , in the building that the poet himself helped to dedicate thirty-two years ago when he wrote for the occasion his now famihar poem , '' The Library , '' which was set to music by
B. J. Lang	PERSON	and sung at the dedicatory exercises .

		Except one private collec - tion , the
Haverhill	LOCATION	accumulation of
Whittier	LOCATION	books and manuscripts and other matter is probably the largest in existence .

		It contains more than three hundred items , including of course most of the editions of the poet 's writings and -LRB- most valuable of all -RRB- a file of the ''
Haver	PERSON	- hill Gazette , '' to which
Whittier	LOCATION	contributed the greater number of his early poems , often under anassumed name .

		How many of his obscurely published poems have never been collected or even identified , no one can tell ; but their number must be large .

		The entire collection at the
Haverhill	LOCATION	library , with its suggestion of much still imcoUected matter , impresses the observer with the modest
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	poet 's great and ready productivity .

		Verse must have been , indeed , from his very youth , the most natural medium of expression to this American poet .

		... Genius in distress is always a moving spectacle -- except , perhaps , when the sufferer comes knocking at our own door with a petition for relief .

		A story now current concerning the unfortunate poet
Francis Thompson	PERSON	, whose death was recently reported from
London	LOCATION	, has elements of pathos and also a touch of the marvellous , the supernatural , and the ghostly .

		Prob - ably the tale has lost nothing in the telling , but it is said that poor
Thompson	PERSON	, whose fortunes once reached so low an ebb that he even resorted to match-selling and to cab-calling at theatre doors to keep body and soul together , at last became so discouraged that he decided to end his wretched existence .

		Saving up his pitiful little earnings until he had enough money to buy a dose of laudanum , he retired with his precious pur - chase to his chosen hamit in C event Garden Market and proceeded to drink the poison ; but he had taken only half when , according to his own account , his hand was arrested , and lo !

		Chatterton stood by his side dissuad - ing him from the rash deed .

		The would-be suicide gave heed , recalling how barely the other had missed the aid and comfort that were on their way to him even as he was drinking that fatal dose of arsenic and water in the attic chamber of No. 39 Brooke Street .

		And so , in
Thompson	PERSON	's case , it proved that an editor who had published some of the poet 's verses and wished to pay him , liad that very day succeeded in tracing him to the chemist 's shop where the laudanum had been bought .

		The story , whether fact or fiction , makes one regret that its hero did not live to enjoy an honored old age , and also illustrates anew the old adage that it is always darkest just before dawn .

		... The perennial book-pilferer , a hardy perennial if there ever was one , continues to vex the authorities of open-shelf libraries .

		Our largest public library , that of
Boston	LOCATION	, loses somewhat over a thousand volumes yearly through theft -- all the branch libraries being included in making up this total .

		But since some hundreds are annually returned as surreptitiously as they were bor - rowed , the final showing is less disheartening than are the figures published at the end of each year .

		Thus , of books reported missing at the central library , 240 were unostentatiously replaced on the shelves in
1902	DATE	, 389 in
1903	DATE	, 336 in
1904	DATE	, 304 in
1905	DATE	, and 251 in
1906	DATE	.

		Moreover , there is some comfort in the official assurance `` that the books taken are principally of the cheaper sort , that many of them are books taken by children , and that in numerous instances they are taken not primarily by theft , but through informal or irregular borrowing , in disregard of the proper rules relating to charging upon a library card .

		It is also clear , from our experience , that many books taken from the open shelves , no doubt with the intention of returning them , never are returned ; probably being thrown aside or forgotten by the irresponsible persons who took them . ''

		The irregular borrowing of a book for purposes of reading or study is a venial offence compared with the taking of a rare edition to fill a gap in one 's private collection , or with appropriating an expensive volume in order to raise money by its sale .

		... The popular patronage of public libraries appears to be fully twice as great in this country as in
Great Britain	LOCATION	-- a gratifying testimonial to the practical efficiency of our highly-developed system of library management .

		Mr.
J. Duff Brown	PERSON	has made a digest of the reports of three hundred public libraries in the
United Kingdom	LOCATION	; and from this digest we learn that t -RRB- f the population supplied with free libraries only about six per cent have registered as borrowers , only two and one-half per cent visit the reading rooms , and the average number of books drawn annually by each borrower -RCB- is three .

		While no corresponding statistics of our own libraries are available , yet the figures published by several of them separately make a comparatively cred - itable showing .

		Thus , according to late reports , the number of registered borrowers in
Boston	LOCATION	is about thir - teen per cent , in
Brooklyn	LOCATION	about seventeen , in
Queens	LOCATION	- 10 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, borough and in
Louisville	LOCATION	the same , in Grand Rapids sixteen , in
Bridgeport	LOCATION	ten , while in some of the smaller commiuiities the percentage rises to forty and fifty .

		Even the lowest of these figures is far above the British average ; but after all it is to be regretted , and also to be wondered at , that it is not higher .

		If all who refused to avail themselves of their publie-hbrary privileges were to miite and to vote a suspension of the public appro - priation for library support , what a cloud of intellectual darkness would overspread the land !

		An octogenarian
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	scholar whom many will delight to honor with at least a silent tribute of admiration and good will as he enters on his ninth decade of useful years , is Dr.
William J. Rolfe	PERSON	, of
Cambridge	LOCATION	-- our
Cambridge	LOCATION	, the public library of which has just issued a forty-page bibliography of
Rolfiana	LOCATION	, if we may coin the word .

		In a chronological arrange - ment are given the books and other published writings of Dr.
Rolfe	PERSON	, the articles written about him , and addi - tional miscellaneous matters .

		It is interesting to learn that this veteran of the pen began to write at fourteen , his first pieces being short reports for
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	news - papers .

		From
1850	DATE	to
1868	DATE	be devoted the best of his energies to teaching .

		Cambridge has been his home since
1862	DATE	, and for the last foi ` ty years he has been mainly engaged in editorial and other hterary work , and in lecturing , holding for the last four years the presidency of the
Emerson College of Oratory	ORGANIZATION	, in
Boston	LOCATION	.

		Best known to the general public as the editor of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays in most handy and serviceable form , he enjoys among the learned the reputation of a leading Shakespeare scholar . ''

		We camiot hold mor - tality 's strong hand , '' but we can hope its touch may not for many a year be laid on that busy pen .

		• • • Mr.
James	PERSON	's revision of his early novels is awaited with curiosity .

		The announcement that he was to re-write them so far as it should be found necessary in order to bring them into harmony with his later man - ner , w ^ as a rather extraordinary bit of literary news .

		The desirability of a uniform edition of his motley-clad works , with a preface from his own hand to each vol - ume , is felt by librarians and booksellers as well as by would-be private possessors of his complete writings ; but not a few readers , recalling the simple charm of ''
Daisy Miller	PERSON	'' and ''
Roderick Hudson	PERSON	, '' will cherish a hope that these and other early romances of his may not be retold in the maimer of '' The Ambassadors '' or `` The Golden Bowl . '' ''

		Who am I tliat I should tam - per with a classic ? ''

		asked a young author when requested to revise a bit of his own work .

		There are those who would resent the re-clothing of ''
Daisy Miller	PERSON	'' in more studied and elaborate dress very much as the yomig folk of all
Christendom	LOCATION	would cry out against any recasting of the tale of '' Little Red Riding Hood . ''

		Let Mr.
James	PERSON	respect the classics , even those from his own pen .

		... Volunteer work in library inspection is pro- ducing good results in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, that one State in the
Union	LOCATION	whose every town enjoys free-library privi - leges .

		The idea was conceived by Mr.
Tillinghast	PERSON	, chairman of the public library commission , that a corps of volunteer , unpaid inspectors , men and women disin - terestedly desirous of improving the free libraries in their neighborhood , and possessed of the requisite qualifications for the work , would effect more for the cause than the same number of paid employees , and at the same time would save to the public a considerable sum that could better be spent in carrying mto effect such plans of enlargement and improvement as they might find reason to recommend .

		This work of inspec - tion , which is said to cost the
State of Wisconsin	LOCATION	about
$ 15,000	MONEY	a year , is now engaged in by fifteen or twenty efficient volunteers in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, all bending their efforts to the same end and following the same general rules , with gratifying results already manifest .

		In further support of the new plan , it is said that visits of hired officials are not so cordially received by librarians as those of persons giving their time and thought solely for the good of the libraries .

		... A FAVORITE New England story-writer who , with Miss
Sarah Orne Jewett	PERSON	and Mrs.
Mary E. Wilkins Freeman	PERSON	, has the happy knack of presenting Yankee character and Yankee eccentricity in most lifelike guise , has recently passed one of the more important milestones set up along the road to remmd us of our mortality .

		Miss
Alice Brown	PERSON	has no silly sensitiveness on the score of her age -- there is convincing evidence to prove this -- but let it here suffice that she has lived an aliquot part of a century , and we hope she may live the remaining part or parts , to continue to delight the world with the products of her fertile pen .

		In this hope the readers of ''
Rose MacLeod	PERSON	, '' her serial story now appearing in '' The
Atlantic	LOCATION	, '' are surely with us .

		... Competition in book circulation among libraries is not always a laudable rivalry .

		It might , conceivably , lead very easily to the fostering of a sort of sham circu - lation ; that is , attaches and friends of the library would find no difficulty in swelling the circulation statistics of an ambitious librarian by drawing books oftener and in greater numbers than their actual needs required .

		The
Examining Committee of the Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	reports that competition in this matter among the branch libraries is too keen , and recommends that only the total circulation of all the branches be published .

		Emphasis ought really to be placed on the quality rather than the quantity of the reading .

		Portable reading-rooms are among the innovations recommended in the
Boston	LOCATION	Public Library 's interesting '' Fifty-fourth Annual Report . ''

		The city already has portable school-houses , and '' travelling libraries '' were long ago sent abroad on their beneficent journeys through the land ; and now it is believed that portable reading-rooms '' would prove serviceable in outlying and in tenement districts . ''

		This plan , the reverse of lead - ing the horse to the watering-trough , has much to com - mend it .

		The proposed structures , besides tending to counteract the allurements of drinking-saloons and other low resorts , would presumably serve as distributing stations of books for home use .

		• • .

		New editions of `` Alice in
Wonderland	LOCATION	'' are falling thick and fast from the press .

		From
London	LOCATION	alone word comes of five such issues -- all due to the recent expiration of the 42-years copyright which the book has enjoyed under the law .

		Whether any healthy , normal child under the age of fifteen can see aught but foolishness in this delicious masterpiece , will never be positively determmed ; but certain it is that fun-loving adults will always keep a warm place ui their hearts for
Alice	ORGANIZATION	.

		She ought now to make hosts of new friends among the purchasers of inexpensive uncopyrighted books .

		THE DIAL 11 t Hito lS00ks .

		The IjEtters of a
Witty Parsox	ORGANIZATION	.

		* In an early unpublished letter ,
Lowell	PERSON	de - clared that nature had originally intended him for the church , but that in mixing the ingre - dients she had added a little too much humor and so spoiled him for pulpit purposes .

		Dean Hole , of pleasant memory , famous in both his spoken and his written word for the merry humor that enlivened his utterances , appears to have let no consciousness of his own drollery deter him for one moment from donning the clerical robe .

		In him , however , it is rather the keenly-flashing wit than the subtly indescribable but never unrecognizable touch of humor that provokes one 's mirth ; but , for that matter , per - haps the same could be said of
Lowell	LOCATION	.

		Be that as it may , the selection from the Dean 's letters that Mr.
Dewar	PERSON	has edited , with a brief memoir , contains some very enjoyable specimens of the writer 's playful fancy , and gives us a charming sketch of him in undress to place beside the more formally finished portrait of the '' Memories '' and the '' Little Tour in
America	LOCATION	'' -- though the likeness there shown conveys no suggestion of stiilness or ceremony .

		The friendship between the Dean and his present editor appears to have grown out of a common love of nature and an interest in flori - culture ; this is to be inferred from three letters addressed to Mr.
Dewar	PERSON	and included in the volume .

		The prefatory memoir is so good that one wishes it were longer .

		Making no attempt to give a biography of the man , it touches lightly and gracefully , with illustrative anecdotes , on the more prominent traits of the Dean 's char - axjter .

		His unfailing quickness of wit is seen in the following incident : '' Once he called on Mr.
George Allen	PERSON	at
Sunnyside	LOCATION	,
Orpington	LOCATION	, with some inquiry about
Ruskin	PERSON	's work , * The Seven Lamps of Architecture , ' which had lately been republished .

		As he left the hall , he struck smartly with his head a hanging lamp .

		The last thing that , as a rule , comes off a man 's tongue in a case like this is a witty remark ; but Hole instantly remarked with good humour , ' If I am not careful , there will only be Six Lamps left ! ' ''

		In choosing the letters for publication , the editor has shown wisdom in picking with a spar - ing hand and also in not including letters merely because they were written to persons of distinc - tion .

		Hole was on the friendliest terms with all sorts and conditions of men , and his informal • The Letters of

Rochester	LOCATION	.

New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		letters to old-time country cronies are more characteristic and entertaining than his decanal epistles to '' My dear Lord Bishop '' or other dignitary of church or state .

		The letters have little value as `` side-lights '' to history , and seldom refer to any absorbing social or political question of the hour ; they touch not on any controversies between the various sections of the church , high and low , broad and narrow ; they are not tinged with the slightest shade of odium theologicum , though their writer was well known to have the courage of his convictions ; and they do not afford the briefest peep behind the scenes in church politics or polemics .

		All this is plainly stated at the outset , and if the editor may occasionally be charged with going to the other extreme in serving up matter that savors of the tasteless and trivial , he at least gives us a good picture of his author 's unfailing lightness of heart and frolicsomeness of mood up to the very year , if not day and hour , of his death , -- a cheer - ing example of '' an old age serene and bright '' that never outgrew the appeal of things inno - cently amusing .

		Something of the perennial boyishness of genius was his . ''

		Quick , impid - sive , ready to kindle up , and as ready to forgive , with an imboimded relish for life and for its humours and sympathy with its light and shade -- that was the boyishness of him , and it wielded its instrument in the quick-flashing wit which sometimes took form in anecdote , and sometimes flitted by in the turn of a phrase , or a lialf - noticed word . ''

		Thus was he described by a friend who knew him well .

		A letter to
John Leech	PERSON	, written in
1859	DATE	, soon after the appearance of '' A Little Tour in
Ireland	LOCATION	, '' which Hole wrote and Leech illus - trated , is among those in lighter vein .

		The two men were affectionate friends , and upon
Leech	ORGANIZATION	's early death the other wrote a memoir of the lamented artist .

		The letter begins : '' I have received a cheque from
Bradbury & Evans	ORGANIZATION	for # 105 , with an allusion to future favors .

		I have thanked them sincerely , but my chief thanks and theirs -LRB- as I told them -RRB- are due , of course , to you .

		For they know , and I know , and you know , and all the world knows , that ' A Little Tour in
Ireland	LOCATION	' would in all probability have made a Little Ditto to the
Trtmk	PERSON	- makers , had it not been illustrated by
John Leech	PERSON	--
Grod	PERSON	bless him .

		.

		, .

		And so , my friend , with the de - lightful document on '
Smith	PERSON	,
Payne , & Smith	ORGANIZATION	' before me , I see thro ' the signature of '
Bradbury & Evans	ORGANIZATION	' the name of
John Leech	PERSON	, and to him I tender my most genuine gratitude . ''

		Hole 's '' Book about Roses , '' which was pub - lished in
1869	DATE	, must be familiar to rose-lovers .

		In the following extract from a letter to the Rev.
C. C. Ellison	PERSON	-- whom his correspondent 12 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, salutes variously as '' Dear Elli '' and '' My dear Charlie '' and '' Dear Old Charlie '' -- the '' rosarian '' speaks : '' 1 am much pleased to hear of yom * good conduct , as one of my pupils , and of your obtaining a prize .

		Continue m the paths of virtue and industry , wheeling ft upon them large quantities of farm-yard manure to your rose-trees , and you must ultimately win the highest and most honourable of titles , the title of a good Rosarian .

		May the aphis of difficulty and the mildew of disap - pointment always disappear before the syringe of your assiduity and the sulphur of your perseverance . ''

		A story told by Dean Hole in
Chicago	LOCATION	, in the course of his American tour of a dozen years ago , will be recalled by the letter next quoted .

		Its subject is a dog with a taste for religious literature .

		The animal had invaded a young curate 's study and devoured half his sermon , so that when the curate came to deliver it he found himself brought to a premature close , which he afterward apologized for to one of the churchwardens , whereupon the warden said : '' I should be much obliged if you could get our Rector one of the breed . ''

		To a brother clergyman asking what happened to the dog after his strange meal , the Dean , a great dog - lover , replies : '' You will be pleased to hear that when the dog had inwardly digested the sermon which he had torn , he turned over a new leaf .

		He had been sullen and morose , he became < a very jolly dog . '

		He had been selfish and exclusive in his manger , he generously gave it up to an aged poodle .

		He had been noisy and vulgar , he became a quiet , gentlemanly dog , he never growled again ; and when he was bitten he always requested the cur who had torn his flesh to be so good , as a particular favour , to bite him again .

		He has established a Re - formatory in the Isle of Dogs , for perverse puppies , and an infirmary for
Mangy Mastiffs	ORGANIZATION	in
Houndsditch	LOCATION	.

		He has won 26 medals from the Humane Society for res - cuing children who have fallen into the canal .

		He spends six days of the week in conducting his brothers and sisters , who have lost their ways , to the Dogs ' Home , and it is a most touching sight to see him leading the blind to church from morning to night on Smidays . ''

		To his son
Hugh	PERSON	, a young giant of six feet and five inches , who distinguished himself in various capacities during the recent war in
South Africa	LOCATION	, the clerical father writes in a tone of delightful comradeship .

		Here , for instance , is the opening of a letter of
Oct. 6 , 1897	DATE	, which the editor leaves to explain itself : '' I am delighted , my dear Son , with your very inter - esting letter , and I congratulate you heartily on your magnificent right and left in the pursuit of friendships ,
Nansen	PERSON	and
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, two of the most famous men of their day .

		All must admire
Nansen	ORGANIZATION	's heroism , and
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's intellectual power ; and it does one good to be with such men , though m some points , in which they are not experts or students , we may have no sympathies .

		I anticipate a great enjoyment in hearing , viva voce , more details of yonr singular and exciting intercourse .

		We shall be ' Arcades ambo , et cantam -LSB- misprint for cantare -RSB- et respondere parati , ' when we meet , seeing that we have been in half-a-score houses within the last 3 months , and with all sorts and conditions of men . ''

		As a specimen of the Dean 's more serious style -- for he could be deeply serious and pro- foundly impressive when occasion demanded -- let us quote a sentence from a letter wi-itten to the Bishop of
Rochester	LOCATION	three months before the writer 's death . ''

		As the Sun and the Showers have clothed our Kent Orchards with garments of praise , and made the buds of our garments to grow , so your words of warm and refreshing sympathy , from the comfort wherewith you are comforted of God , make my faith glad with the blossoms of hope , and quicken my prayers for those fruits of the Spirit , and those flowers of
Eden	ORGANIZATION	, which will be restored in the new heaven and the new earth , where dwelleth Righteousness . ''

		A friend , quoted in the '' Memoir , '' says of Dean Hole : '' It is difficult to convey just that impression of ' distinction ' or nobleness which was exactly what no one could help receiving from his presence .

		But it would have been difficidt -- and disagreeable -- to bring any - thing mean , or unchivalrous , or unworthy , into his presence . ''

		These words may be fitly sup - plemented by Hole 's definition of a gentleman ; it gives at least a glimpse of the ideal after which he had modelled his own character . ''

		There is no such thing as a gentleman by birth .

		No public schools , no universities , no study of elegant literature , no intellectual attainments , no accomplish - ments , no titled playmates can confer the gift .

		The real elements , the truthfulness which can not he , the uprightness which will not stoop , the courtesy which considers all , the honour which can not be bribed , the command of the passions , the .

		mastery of the tem - per -- these can only be learned from God . ''

		Some good pictures accompany the reading matter ; also an occasional pen-and-ink sketch by the Dean 's own hand -- so variously accom - plished was he .

		The frontispiece portrait of him and the view of the rosary at
Caunton	LOCATION	, with the vicar-gardener standing in its midst , are espe - cially pleasing .

		The only thing calling for a word of adverse criticism in the volume is the ungenial stiffness of its binding , which will far sooner break than bend its obstinate ba `` k.

		Mention was made in that volume of '' A Review of Hamlet '' by the same author -- a contribution to Shakespearian criticism that attracted much attention at the time when it was written , and that had a marked influence upon
Edwin Booth	PERSON	in his interpretation of the Dane .

		The essay is now republished by
Messrs. Longmans	PERSON	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and proves to be a subtle and keenly intelligent analysis of the great tragedy .

		THE DIAL 13
The Heart of Hamlet	ORGANIZATION	's Mystery .

		* Mr.
Churton Collins	PERSON	has remarked that most attempts to pluck out the heart of Hamlet 's mystery have thrown more light upon the char - acter of the interpreter than upon the subject .

		This no doubt explains the tendency of modem criticism to emphasize the subjective difficulties in the way of Hamlet 's accomplishment of his task .

		We like to think of ourselves as dark - ened by a fine melancholy , or paralyzed by an austere intellectuality , or perplexed by a too exacting conscience .

		Like
Coleridge	PERSON	, we are oppressed by the sense of our own impotence , and our criticism becomes an elegy of our thwarted purposes .

		Like Mr.
Collins	PERSON	, we per - ceive in many of the finest types of modem civilization the taint of an immoral aestheticism , and our criticism becomes a warning against the immoderate worship of beauty .

		To this school of critics , the theory of Werder seems a paradox .

		The most psychological play of Shakespeare he interprets as a tragedy of circumstance .

		The most vacillating of heroes he declares to be the incarnation of steady purpose .

		The all but utter failure of Ham - let 's mission he regards as a triumph of foresight .

		In the hero 's tragic death he sees , not the result of thinking too precisely on the event , but the penalty of instinctive and ill-considered action .

		His theory was first expounded in a course of lectures at
Berlin	LOCATION	in 1859-60 .

		Though it was conceived independently , it had been anticipated by
J. L. Klein	PERSON	in
1846	DATE	and by
George Fletcher	PERSON	in
1845	DATE	.

		Dr.
Fumess	PERSON	refers to it with approval in the
Variorum Hamlet	LOCATION	, and it has been accepted by
Hudson	LOCATION	and
Rolfe	PERSON	.

		It is briefly this : Hamlet 's problem is to avenge his father 's murder , but so to avenge it as to make the justice of his act evident to all .

		The confession of
Claudius	PERSON	, therefore , not his death , is the first necessity .

		To kill the
King	ORGANIZATION	would be to kill the only proof of his crime .

		From this point of view the play becomes a struggle between
Hamlet	ORGANIZATION	's instinctive and almost overmastering impulse to slay , and his deliberate conscientious self-restraint until he shall have forced the criminal to convict him - self .

		In the murder of Polonius , instinct tri - umphs over reason and conscience ; and hence arise all the evils of the latter part of the play -- the madness of
Ophelia	LOCATION	, the death of the Queen , and the death of Hamlet himself .

Horatio	PERSON	lives to tell his story and to heal his wounded name .

		It is this struggle that gives significance to
Hamlet	LOCATION	's self-reproaches .

		After the interview with the players , he is thinking of the contrast , not between the actor 's passion and his own inertness , but between his thirst for revenge and the necessity of inaction .

		In the most famous of the soliloquies , the point of his reflection is that conscience , which in his bitterness he calls cowardice , keeps him from suicide as from vengeance .

		And in the com - ment on Fortinbras ' venture , he is thinking of the prince 's freedom to act and his own enforced delay .

		It is all plausible enough ; but then , so mani - fold is the suggestiveness of the play that almost any theory can be made plausible .

		For the same reason , there is no theory against which strong objections can not be urged .

		Our wisest course is to adopt the theory that on the whole best represents our own experience with Hamlet , without too close attention to the objections that can be produced against it .

		Against Professor
Werder	PERSON	's theory , as a whole , we have nothing to say , except that it does not represent our experience with Hamlet .

		Against details of it , there are some objections that are perhaps not idle .

		Like most students of the play , he makes far too little of its history , of the traditional material that is imbedded in it ; far too little , also , of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's care - less acceptance of such material , with little or no effort to motivate it .

		Reflections of this sort should temper our deliverances upon the assumed madness , and our efforts to acquit Hamlet of blame for the death of his two school - fellows .

		Marvellous as the motivation of this play is , a motivation that we can see in process of development , there is a limit to it fixed by the dramatist 's fatigue or lack of time .

		Hence , in part , the mystery of the play .

		As usual , the commentator seems to us to have forced his own interpretation upon certain passages in defiance of the plain sense .

		Hardly anything in the earlier scenes is more striking than Hamlet 's physical revulsion from his mother 's marriage , which , to an audience with centuries of Catholicism in their blood , would have seemed very like incest .

		Yet Professor Werder never refers to this , and explains the horror of the first soliloquy as due to a pre - sentiment of the murder .

		It is not true that '' Hamlet breathes no word of complaint of hav - 14 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, ing suffered '' from
Claudius	PERSON	' usurpation .

		No other interpretation is possible of '' A cutpurse of the empire and the rule , That from a shelf the precious diadem stole , And put it in his pocket '' -LRB- 3.4.99-101 -RRB- ; and ''
Popp	PERSON	'd in between the election and my hopes '' -LRB- 5.2.65 . -RRB-

		The Ghost , says Professor Werder , '' does not blame Hamlet for his delay , as the critics have done '' ; and he quotes , in confirmation of his statement , -- '' Do not forg ` et .

		This visitation Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose '' -LRB- 3.4.110 , 111 . -RRB-

		The series of questions on page 69 is typical of the attitude of many students toward Shake - speare 's `` feigned histories . ''

		Why , Professor Werder asks , was the time out of joint ?

		Why were there no wise counsellors , no noble war - riors , at the court of Claudius ?

		Did the elder Hamlet outlive all the better element of his court ?

		and is this the reason why Claudius re - mained in undisputed possession of the throne ?

		Such questions are a tribute to the poet 's power of creating an illusion , but they do not indicate a fruitful critical method .

		An interpretation of this kind , however plausible , seems to us to pluck out the heart of Hamlet 's mystery indetid , to rob it of much of its stimulating and moving quality .

		If it is cor - rect , the play is less profound , less poignant , less modem than we have thought , and we have shed our tears in vain over the wreck of precious and splendid things that were not fitted to survive .

		Control , .

		* The third volume of Professor
Osgood	PERSON	's notable work , ''
The American Colonies	ORGANIZATION	in the
Seventeenth Century	LOCATION	, '' rounds out , after an interval of three years , that part of the classi - fication of the Colonies which the writer omitted from consideration in his first instalment of two volumes .

		A word is needed , perhaps , to remind one of this classification , in order that the purpose of the work may be fully understood .

		Instead of treating the Colonies from a purely chronological standpoint , or , on the other hand , taking up successively each
Colony	ORGANIZATION	or group of Colonies in geographical order ,
ProiEessor Osgood	ORGANIZATION	has developed in earlier monographs and now in this extensive treatise the idea that the true * The American Colonies in the
Seventeenth Century	ORGANIZATION	.

System of Royal Provinces	ORGANIZATION	.


New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		method of approach is to classify the Colonies according to their internal governmental struc - ture , and then to trace the development of each of the groups thus set apart .

		Following out this plan , Professor
Osgood	PERSON	substitutes for the old simple division into Royal , Charter , and Pro- prietary Colonies , a more complex analysis into Corporate Colonies and Provinces , then divid - ing the latter class into
Royal	ORGANIZATION	and Proprietary Provinces .

		In his earlier papers he showed the sharp distinction that must be observed between the structure of the
Corporate Colony	ORGANIZATION	-- exem - plified in
Connecticut	LOCATION	,
Rhode Island	LOCATION	, and Mas - sachusetts before
1684	DATE	-- and the Provinces ; and he furthermore maintained the essential oneness in principle of the Proprietary Province -- whether the proprietor were an individual , a group of individuals , or a company -- and the
Royal Province	ORGANIZATION	.

		But parallel with the classification into Corporations and Provinces is another , which divides the Colonies into those which enjoyed the advantages of charters and those which did not : for Corporations and Proprietary Pro- vinces alike had charters , while Royal Provinces , except
Massachusetts	LOCATION	after
1691	DATE	, had none .

		These two canons of division influence one another ; and in the two volumes first issued it was the Chartered Colonies , Corporations , and Proprietary Provinces that were compared .

		The field left to this third volume is consequently the Royal Province ; and thus
Virginia	LOCATION	after
1624	DATE	, the dissolution of the
Massachusetts Bay Company	LOCATION	, the beginnings of royal government in
New Hampshire	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	, the admin - istration of Governor Andros in the
Eastern Provinces	ORGANIZATION	, together with the revolutionary move - ments which in
1689	DATE	appeared in
New York	LOCATION	, in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, and in
Maryland	LOCATION	, -- these parts of Colonial history are developed with the same clearness and wealth of details that char - acterized the earlier portion of the work .

		The institutional life of the
Royal Province	ORGANIZATION	is not treated under such separate heads as the Land System , the Official System , the
Financial System	ORGANIZATION	,
Ecclesiastical Relations	ORGANIZATION	, etc. , as were used in the preceding volumes , but is developed along with the narrative .

		This is due , in aU probability , to the fact that only a small part of the life of the Royal Provinces other than
Virginia	LOCATION	lies within the limits of the period chosen by Professor
Osgood	PERSON	, the seventeenth century .

		The gTcatest value of the present volume lies in its discussion of the imperial control of
Ensland	LOCATION	.

		The author begins with the thesis
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 16 that the central fact in this connection is the process of transformation out of Chartered Colonies into Royal Provinces .

		He recalls that the problem of British administration was not one of race but merely of distance .

		Attempts to enlist the interest of Parliament were sum - marily checked , and control of the Colonies , so far as it was exercised at all , remained a func - tion of the executive government of
England	LOCATION	, assisted by the various councils and boards and minor agencies , of which Professor
Osgood	PERSON	gives a most helpful account .

		The seventeenth cen - tury was the day of the
Chartered Colony	ORGANIZATION	, feudal in its aspect , remote from the mother - country .

		It was the Restoration , with the consequent commercial legislation , that made apparent the need and stimulated the desire for control ; and this found its ' completest expres - sion in the tendency to substitute for the
Chartered Colony	ORGANIZATION	the Royal Province -- a ten - dency that reached high-tide under King
James II.	PERSON	, and was checked by the Revolution of
1688	DATE	and the reflections of that event on this side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	among the colonists them - selves .

		The
Stuart	PERSON	plan had involved the destruction of Colonial legislatures and the union of the Colonies into governor-generalships .

		The result of the Revolutionary period was the con - tinuance of the tendency to establish Royal Provinces , but with the concession , through a compromise with local spirit , of provincial assemblies .

		This , in a few words , is the scope of the volume .

		Included , of course , is an account of
Cromwell	ORGANIZATION	's colonial policy ; of the group of statesmen about the court of
Charles II.	PERSON	, who took an active part in the revival of interest in colonization , of the legislation regarding com - merce that centred in the acts of
1660	DATE	,
1663	DATE	, and
1673	DATE	, of the machinery that was developed for the enforcement of these acts , and of such special commissions for the settlement of American affairs as those sent in
1664	DATE	to
New England	LOCATION	and in
1677	DATE	to
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		It is the impression of unity derived from the reading of this part of the work that gives support to the author 's somewhat positive statement that in this volume '' the attempt has for the first time been made to trace the history of this control as a distinct and separate feature of colonization . ''

		Yet , as Professor
Osgood	PERSON	himself states , this is '' something less than a history of British Colonial administration in
America	LOCATION	, '' because '' the island Colonies , with
Newfoundland	LOCATION	, are for the most part left out of account . ''

		It is true , says the author in explanation of this omission , that
Great Britain	LOCATION	considered these more important than the continental Colonies , and thus laid part of the ground of the
Revolu	PERSON	- tion ; yet the experience of the latter '' amply illustrates all the phases of the British system of control . ''

		Whether this resolution to exclude the island Colonies is wisely taken is a matter of doubt .

		In the beginning of the volume the author dismisses with something like a non possumus the whole question of the extension to the Colonies of English law .

		One wishes , in view of the completeness of Professor
Osgood	PERSON	's discussion of other phases of the subject , that he had devoted his own hand to this , at least to the extent of informing the reader that the English courts did consider the matter , and , in a series of cases from
Calvin	PERSON	's case to
Campbell vs. Hall	ORGANIZATION	, did formulate a doctrine ; and that in this series of cases one of special importance , that of
Blankard vs. Galdy	ORGANIZATION	, was concerned with the extension of English statutes to the island of
Jamaica	LOCATION	, which had been added to the Empire by conquest from the Spanish in the time of
Cromwell	LOCATION	, ajid in which the matter of the ex - tension of the laws of
England	LOCATION	had been the groiuid of a long political controversy .

		How - ever , although one may find that Professor
Osgood	PERSON	has not included all the English Colonies in
America	LOCATION	, and has not treated ex - haustively all phases of imperial control , one leaves the work with a feeling which constitutes a very real testimony to its value -- the hope that before many years the author will continue it into the no less important epoch of the eighteenth century .

		16 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, story of his life and of the service that he per - formed .

		The work worthily fills a gap in the financial history of the
United States	LOCATION	; and not only the financial history , -- but , as armies crawl on their bellies , and without vast sums of money the best-laid plans of statesmen and commanders can not be carried out , the man who raised the money and maintained the credit of the country through all the confusion and stress is entitled to a secure if comparatively humble place on the roll of the benefactors of the na - tion .

		It may seem to the reader , in these days of exalted finance , that two volumes containing more than twelve hundred large pages are rather too much to ask him to read about a well-nigh forgotten financier ; but we can assure him that he will not waste the time that he shall devote to this book .

		Mr.
Cooke	PERSON	left an enormous amount of material for this biography , includ - ing letters from many of the foremost public men of his time , with whom he was on terms of intimacy ; through these we get many glimpses into the inside workings of the government .

		He also left chests full of memoranda and remi - niscences .

		This material Dr.
Oberholtzer	PERSON	has carefully worked over , supplementing it from the newspapers of the day ; the residt is a work that is not only an interesting biography of a man of unique power and personality , but also one that throws light on the public life , business methods , and moral standards of the decade from
1861	DATE	to
1873	DATE	.

		Many portraits and fac - similes add to the value of the book .

		The father of
Jay Cooke	PERSON	was a pioneer set - tler in northern
Ohio	LOCATION	, a man prominent in law and business ; he was elected to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	in
1830	DATE	, and took a leading part in the develop - ment of the region .

		His brothers were sent to school ; but the future financier would not go , and at fourteen he went into a store .

		He dis - played great business ability wherever he was employed ; at nineteen he had a prominent posi - tion in a large
Philadelphia	LOCATION	banking house , and at twenty-one he had earned a partnership in the concern .

		In
1861	DATE	the house of
Jay Cooke & Co.	ORGANIZATION	was launched , and it at once took a lead - ing position on account of the great reputation of its head as banker and successful promoter .

		The house lived only twelve years ; but they were notable years .

		One large enterprise after another was carried to a success that seemed impossible at the outset , and men became ac - customed to coupling the name of
Jay Cooke	PERSON	with successful enterprises .

		More than five hundred pages of this work are given to Mr.
Cooke	PERSON	's efforts to sell the different series of bonds issued by Secretary Chase , and the whole story , as told here in full for the first time , is one of absorbing interest and permanent historical value .

		It may be that the biographer exalts his hero 's wisdom and foresight unduly at the expense of Secretary Chase ; yet it seems to be true that when Mr.
Cooke	PERSON	's methods were adopted and his plans were followed bonds were sold with startling - rapidity , money was forthcoming tQ meet the drain on the national treasury , and the credit of the nation was maintained , and when Chase and his successors attempted to get on with - out him sales lagged and the money did not come in .

		His success was due to his belief in himself and in the people , and to the great organization that he built up for carrying the matter directly to them , appealing to their patriotism and their thrift at the same time .

		He could make plain men believe that the country was sound and would win in the strug - gle , and would keep its faith with those who should trust it with their savings .

		And so the money poured in , in a flood that astonished even the man of faith who had organized the movement .

		Some of the scenes described in this book are thrilling in their interest .

		The letters and newspaper extracts included give vividness to the narrative , though some of the judgments and opinions they contain are the product of the enthusiasm of the time .

		The author is wholesomely frank in giving Mr.
Cooke	PERSON	's methods of dealing with public men and newspaper writers , some of which amount to bribery .

		But standards were different forty years ago , and no one can accuse Mr.
Cooke	PERSON	of bribing men to serve his own interest ; it was the success of the cause that he had at heart that seemed to him to justify the sometimes questionable means employed .

		An interesting chapter is that on the estab - lishment of our system of
National Banks	ORGANIZATION	, to which Mr.
Cooke	PERSON	devoted the same energy , and in which the same astonishing success followed his efforts .

		Through his nation-wide organiza - tion , he created a public demand that made a hostile
Congress	ORGANIZATION	take notice , and then hasten to pass the bUl creating the system .

		He under - took a campaign to bring the reluctant state banks into the plan , using to the full the prestige of his past successes and the persuasion of his powerful personality .

		Though the biographer may here also exaggerate somewhat his part , yet he presents documents that prove the value of Mr.
Cooke	PERSON	's service in this vitally important development of our financial system .

		THE DIAL 17 A large part of the second volume is given to Mr.
Cooke	PERSON	's efforts to promote , build , and finance the
Northern Pacific Railroad	ORGANIZATION	.

		This was a tremendous undertaking , such as he de - lighted in .

		It was a private enterprise with enormous profits awaiting its success ; but the opening of a vast new region to settlement kindled his imagination , and the patriotic motive seems to have been even more powerful than the financial one .

		The full story of the negotiations at home and abroad for the hundred
millions of dollars	MONEY	needed for the work is most interesting .

		Here again we see methods that we now call questionable ; instead of the success that at one time seemed near , through foreign political com - plications and the reckless fixing of capital in improfitable undertakings at home a crash came that ruined Mr.
Cooke	PERSON	and was the immediate cause of the disastrous panic of
1873	DATE	.

		In telling this story Dr.
Oberholtzer	PERSON	gives all sides , but his admiration of his hero is so great that he can - not refrain from bitter criticism of those men of cooler blood who held back , criticized , and in some cases blocked Mr.
Cooke	PERSON	's plans .

Canada	LOCATION	From A French View-Point .

		* It was a happy thought of Dr.
Siegfried	PERSON	's to bring his intimate study of racial and religious problems in
Canada	LOCATION	within reach of the large number of readers who could not read the book in the original .

		The French edition had already attracted a great deal of attention among French-Canadians , although , discussing the relations of
Church and State	ORGANIZATION	with perfect frankness as Dr.
Siegfried	PERSON	does , his book has inevitably not been popular with the ecclesiasti - cal authorities of French-speaking
Canada	LOCATION	.

		The translation , under the title '' The Race Question in
Canada	LOCATION	, '' maybe commended to anyone , inside or outside of
Canada	LOCATION	, who is interested in the political and social development of the lusty young
Dominion	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dr.
Siegfried	PERSON	's opening paragraph admirably summarizes the scope of his essay . ''

		Canadian politics , '' he says , '' are a tilting-ground for impassioned rivalries .

		An immemorial struggle persists between French and English , Catholics and Protestants , while an influence is gathering strength close by them which some day may become predominant -- that of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		ground in an introductory chapter .

		Dr.
Siegfried	PERSON	proceeds to analyze very thoroughly and effec - tively this complex problem with which , in his view , Canadians are faced .

		Opening with the
Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	, he discusses with great clear - ness its administrative methods , its fear of English Protestant influence and its even greater fear of the spirit of
Modern France	LOCATION	, its extra - ordinary influence over the French Canadian people , and its intervention in politics .

		A chapter follows on Protestantism in
Canada	LOCATION	; and here the author is equally outspoken in his criticism of the Protestant point of view .

		An interesting point which he brings out , incident - ally , is the practical impossibility under existing circumstances of Protestantism making headway among the French population of
Quebec	LOCATION	.

		If a French-Protestant marries a French-Catholic , he must agree to the children being brought up as Catholics ; if , on the other hand , he marries an English-Protestant , his children become , sooner or later , English-Protestants .

		In either case the French - Protestant strain dies out .

		Dr.
Siegfried	PERSON	's treatment of the complicated educational problem in
Canada	LOCATION	, the very differ - ent points of view of the English and French elements in the country , the active interference of the
Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	and the less obvious but real influence of the Protestant Churches , the conflicting elements of provincial and federal authority , is admirable ; as is also his discussion of the attitude of French-Canadians and English - Canadians respectively toward
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, the
United States	LOCATION	, and each other ; of Canadian politics , including the national constitution , political parties , elections , the tone of parlia - mentary life ; of French-Canadian ambitions ; the spread of American influence in the
Dominion	LOCATION	; the movement toward
Imperial Federation	ORGANIZATION	, which Dr.
Siegfried	PERSON	believes to have already passed its flood and to be now well on the ebb tide ; and many other live Canadian ques - tions .

		He may be , perhaps , a little too inclined to accept the views of that brilliant but erratic young French-Canadian ,
M. Henri Bourassa	PERSON	, grandson of
Papineau	PERSON	the leader of the Rebellion of
1837	DATE	, as representing public opinion in the province of
Quebec	LOCATION	; and he is certainly far astray in supposing that Dr.
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	's well-known opinions as to the ultimate destiny of
Canada	LOCATION	are shared by any appreciable num - ber of Canadians .

		But taking his book as a whole , it is unquestionably one of the most interesting and reaUy valuable studies of Canadian problems that has yet been written , and compares more than favorably with the 18 THE DIAL -LSB-

		Briefs on New Books .

		A beautiful new tree-book .

		In his handbook of the trees of the
Northern United States	LOCATION	and
Canada	LOCATION	east of the
Rocky Mountains	LOCATION	, Mr.
R. B. Hough	PERSON	has done all tree-lovers and his country at large a real and important service .

		Here we have presented by accurate scientific description , and exact half-tone plates , more than two hundred species of American forest trees .

		Two opposing pages are given to each species .

		On the one hand we have illustrated the leaves , flowers , twigs , and fruits , nearly every character needed for identification , photographed to scale , so that the reader may know the actual size of these structures ; on the opposite page we have , with the descriptive matter , a photo - graphic representation of the trunk of the tree , show - ing the details of bark and habit , and again referring to a definite scale ; so that , all apart from letter-press , the illustrations in the book should make a competent forester of every man who can use his eyes .

		The scale applied to the tree-trunk to show its size is more often a two-foot rule ; but not always , as wit - ness page 325 .

		It would seem ungracious to note errors in a work like this , published by the author himself -LRB- LowvUle , N. Y. -RRB- ; but since in his preface he invites criticism for the benefit of a future edition , it may be said that errors , whether in typo - graphy or in the illustrations , are by no means few .

		A small map accompanies each species ' description , intended to show the distribution of the tree in question .

		These maps are often inaccurate , some - times by as much as the width of a whole state .

		For instance , the witch-hazel is shown by the map as common to all
Iowa	LOCATION	; the species reaches the
Mississippi River	LOCATION	from the east , but it is doubtful if it occurs within the limits of
Iowa	LOCATION	at all except rarely in one or two counties in the extreme north - eastern corner .

		On the other hand , the smooth sumac , which covers the country , is omitted entirely from this list of familiar trees and shrubs .

		Similar criticism may be made with respect to many other species cited .

		The distribution for the west side of the
Mississippi River	LOCATION	, as shown upon the map , is very often incorrect .

		The proof-reader also has done his work rather carelessly .

		Scientific names are not only wrongly spelled , but are differently spelled on different pages .

		A glossary accompanies the work , and this also contains many inaccuracies of definition and statement .

		Nevertheless , the book Mr.
Hough	PERSON	has given us is unique and beautiful as well as extremely useful , and deserves a place in the library of every tree-lover in the world .

		Positivism as the Having in a previous volume , `` The philosophy of Creed of a Layman , '' set forth the common-sense .

		grounds on which he had found peace in a religion of common sense , Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	now endeavors , in a second volume entitled '' The Philosophy of Common Sense '' -LRB- MacmUlan -RRB- , to show the intellectual basis on which such a faith is grounded .

		The book brings together papers read before the
Metaphysical Society	ORGANIZATION	in the seventies , and essays published in English periodicals in the seventies and eighties , with little introduction of new matter ; but the collected issue of these various utterances in defense of positivism as the one and only common-sense philosophy forms a valuable and highly readable sequel to the preceding number of the series .

		Having found all other schemes of syn - thetic philosophy one-sided and incomplete , because they lean too far either toward theology on the one hand or toward science on the other , Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	has , after twenty-five years ' study of
Comte	ORGANIZATION	's phil - osophy , convinced himself that it offers the one satisfying synthesis or harmony of the three great concerns of human life -- religion , science , and con - duct .

		It alone is '' adequate to weld into one common life our intellectual , our affective , and our active propensities . ''

		Abandoning the pursuit of absolute truth , and resisting the fascination of metaphysical puzzles , positivism contents itself with relative truth , truth as it affects human beings in a demonstrable and practical way .

		While bearing some resemblance to pragmatism , it nevertheless classes the latter with numerous other '' more or less abortive attempts to solve insoluble problems . ''

		That the author has chosen a question-begging title for his volume is almost too obvious to call for com - ment .

		Positivism is the philosophy of his common - sense , just as materialism , or idealism , or Sufism , or Manicheism may be the most common-sense phil - osophy to another man .

		The philosophy of one who thinks for himself is a part of his very temperament , and no man can cordially accept another 's philosophy in all its details -- any more than Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	can subscribe to every single article in

Stephen Higginson	PERSON	-LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		But the book is more than this .

		As the author says in his Apologia : `` To have been one of the first American shipmasters called on to testify before Parliament as to American colonial matters ; to have been a member of the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	in its closing days ; to have been second in command during the first effective resistance to
Shay	PERSON	's Rebellion ; the first to argue from that peril the need of a stronger government ; the first to suggest that the voices of nine out of the thirteen States could make the Confederacy into a Nation ; the first to organize and equip the
American Navy	ORGANIZATION	under
Jefferson	PERSON	's administration ; -- these afford sufficient ground to justify the writing of any man 's memoir . ''

Boston	LOCATION	merchant and one of the leaders among the Bostonians of his day .

		Like his contemporaries of the
New England Federalists	ORGANIZATION	, he was very grave , very dignified , with the manner of one who felt that he carried on his shoulders the unstable burden of the welfare of '' the masses . ''

		Probably no men ever took themselves more seriously , since the senators of the
Early Roman Republic	ORGANIZATION	, than did these
New England	LOCATION	worthies .

		They felt , as clearly as did James the First , a divine commission to manage the affairs of their less fortunate fellow - men .


Stephen Higginson	PERSON	was undoubtedly a man of sense and insight , but there is hardly ground for the implied conclusion that he shaped and directed national affairs through
Washington	LOCATION	and
Knox	PERSON	.

		He was very influential in
Boston	LOCATION	affairs during many years , and the book contains valuable side-lights on life and social conditions of the time , and on the controversies and political bitternesses of the days when Federal power had been broken in the country at large and was waning in
New England	LOCATION	.

		His direct share in national affairs , beyond a few months of service in the dying
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, in
1783	DATE	, was his service as
Naval Agent	ORGANIZATION	at
Boston	LOCATION	, in which posi - tion he did effective work in equipping a part of the little navy which the Federalists created during their last administration .

Frederick Trevor Hill	PERSON	has put S ^ S : .

Harper	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The author writes with acute legal knowledge and abundant information derived from painstaking research ; and to these he adds a gift for pictorial narrative which suggests a first-rate reporter present at the events he describes .

		The eight legal contests selected for study are regarded as '' decisive '' because they affect in greater or less degree the history of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		They range from '' The

		Of these epoch - making crises in the nation 's progress , Mr.
Hill	PERSON	writes with general candor , with strong convictions , but with no unhistoric bitterness .

		He sympathizes with
Andrew Johnson	PERSON	as the victim of a political persecution which deservedly failed ; he draws from the inglorious partisan conclusion of the
Electoral Commission	ORGANIZATION	the comforting thought that it helped to abolish carpet-bag government in the South ; he recognizes Governor
Altgeld	LOCATION	's pardon of the im - prisoned anarchists as a '' legitimate exercise of executive discretion '' ; and he strips from the
Dred Scott	ORGANIZATION	case much of its romantic aspect as the heroic struggle of an abused slave against a cruel master , pointing out that '' though half a century has elapsed , the question as to how the case started , who the plaintiff and defendant really were , what forces were behind them , and what their motives were , have remained uninvestigated , and the complete story of this famous lawsuit , largely based upon documentary evidence , is here for the first time recorded . ''

		These few hints give but a faint idea of the contents of an unusually interesting book .

		The relations ^ ^ ^ o * ' I ^ ^ ^ ^ g
Fisher	PERSON	's work On `` The of bookkeeping Nature of Capital and Income '' ami economics .

		-LRB- MacmiUan -RRB- is a serious attempt to find a philosophical basis for accounting , and thus to supply the missing link between practical business usages and economic theories .

		The work ought to be of interest both to economists and to accountants , but some readers may be discouraged at the outset by finding familiar terms used with unfamiliar mean - ings .

		The author takes care to define his terms , however , and provides a summary of these defini - tions in the form of a glossaiy ; and since he has taken the pains to compile elaborate collections of definitions -LRB- at least of such important terms as income and capital -RRB- from dictionaries and economic writings , one hesitates to take exception to his decisions as to the meaning which ought to be at - tached to economic terms .

		Professor
Fisher	PERSON	makes use of the mathematical method of demonstration in his appendices , but leaves the body of the book intelligible to almost any careful reader ; and on the whole it will conduce to clearer thinking on economic subjects .

		Ethical and public questions have little place in this volume ; but there is a sentence about stock-watering which is well worth quoting , namely , that to say that stock-watering is not wrong as long as all the terms and conditions are known '' is much like saying that lying is not wrong provided every - body knows that it is lying ; for a false balance-sheet is only one form of a false statement , and , ordinarily , a false statement is made with intent to deceive . ''

		The book is provided with an unusual multiplicity of tables of contents : a '' first summary , '' or list of parts , a '' second summary , '' or list of chapters , and an '' analytical table of contents , '' or list of sections ; while at the beginning of each part the list of chap - ters in that part is conveniently repeated .

		Conversation as an educator Much pleasant and profitable reading is to be found in Mr.
Robert Waters	PERSON	's '' Culture by Conversation '' -LRB-
Dodd	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Its twenty chapters , with supplemental `` table-talk notes '' and other miscellanies , give the subject a thorough treatment , both theory and practice -LRB- rules and illustrations -RRB- having generous space accorded them .

		The author is evidently in love with his subject , and his enthusiasm is contagious .

		One can even forgive an occasional affront offered to books , and such extreme statements as that '' the study of books for a specific purpose never yet formed the mind of any man , '' so pleasantly and convincingly 20 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, does Mr.
Waters	PERSON	present the inestimable advantages of cultured conversation .

		Yet , true though it is that conference maketh a ready man , it surely is to be remembered that reading maketh a full man ; and no better proof of this last could be desii'ed than the book now before us .

		Let not its accom - plished author kick down the ladder , or this one of the ladders , by which he has climbed to the refresh - ing uplands of inspiring and well informed dis - course .

		The trend of some of his remarks reminds one of Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	's humorous regret that his own education had been interrupted by a few years of schooling .

		A few details might call for criticism if space permitted .

		The inclusion of
Brookfield	LOCATION	among the '' Cambridge Apostles '' is probably erroneous :
Brookfield	LOCATION	consorted with them , but there were twelve without him , as Mr.
Waters	PERSON	' s own list shows .

		The apt quotation from
Langhorne	PERSON	's '' Life of Plutarch '' contains a few inaccuracies , according to our edition of the work .

		But these are trifling blemishes on a good and useful and enter - taining book .

		Actuated by a wish to provide a L ^ ZZlfopi practical handbook dealing with the construction , theory , and use of the microscope .

		Dr.
Spitta	PERSON	, President of the ancient and honorable
Queckiett Microscopical Club	ORGANIZATION	of
London	LOCATION	, has written a work entitled '' Microscopy '' -LRB- Button -RRB- .

		It is , however , more than a mere handbook , for its nearly five hundred pages and fifteen plates make up a bulky and somewhat expensive volume .

		WhUe its pages are professedly not technical , they contain a very clear and scientific account of the optical parts of the instrument and of the scientific principles involved in bringing about its present marvellous perfection .

		Modern types of instruments are figured and discussed very fully , barring one -- the product of a firm in this country whose unsurpassed objec - tives are distinctively an American achievement .

		It is hardly possible that a work dealing with the per - fection of microscope objective could be written in
America	LOCATION	and no mention made of the discoveries in this field of practical optics made by the
Ameri	PERSON	- cans
Spencer	PERSON	and ToUes .

		The author has written his book throughout from the standpoint of the user of the microscope .

		It is rich in practical hints which will enable the amateur to secm * e the maximum effi - ciency in his use of the instrument , and at the same time offers a lucid explanation , couched in as simple terms as this highly scientific and technical subject will permit , of the principles involved in the con - struction and use of the microscope .

		Short studies ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ® * sketches and essays , all but in life and one of them reprints , make up Mr. literature .


Charles Sears Baldwin	PERSON	's '' Essays out of Hours '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- .

		Five of these '' pleasant papers appeared originally in `` The Contributors ' Club '' of `` The
Atlantic	LOCATION	, '' and , with one that was first published in `` Putnam 's , '' are the best things in the book , or at least the most entertaining .

		Clothed in crisp , choice , sententious language , they are real gems in their way .

		The essay on travel , and that entitled '' Not as One that Beateth the Air , '' yield genuine delight to the reader .

		Almost equally good is a short piece in praise of '' Master Vergil . ''

		But who , alas , now reads the '' ^ neid , '' after having once laboriously done it to death in the schoolroom ?

		More pretentious chapters of Mr.
Baldwin	PERSON	's book treat of
Sterne	PERSON	's influence on French literature , of
John Bunyan	PERSON	, and of the genesis of the short story -- aU scholarly and good .

		But one is a little surprised to find the writer 's scholarship permitting such blemishes as '' unique '' in the superlative degree of comparison , and '' ruck '' for the now more polite '' majority '' or '' multitude . ''

		Of course '' ruck '' has a venerable antiquity behind it , and perhaps we ought to overcome our squeamishness and applaud rather than condemn an author 's heroic attempt to reinstate the word in good usage .

		That voluminous editor and com - of ^ lmlTarTiifl . '

		^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ * * ^ ® middle nineteenth century , the Rev.
Robert Aris Will	PERSON	- mott , is now best remembered , if remembered at all , for his `` Pleasures , Objects , and Advantages of Literature , '' which was published in
1851	DATE	, went into a fifth edition in
1860	DATE	, and had already two years before enjoyed the distinction of a fifth German edition .

		Under the abbreviated title , '' Pleasures of Literature , '' it is now republished by the Putnams , with a short biographical and critical introduction from the pen of Mr.
Cranstoun Metcalfe	PERSON	.


Willmott	PERSON	's style suggests that of the best seventeenth-century prose-wi ` iters .

		It is ornate , and at the same time sententious , learned , and occasionally over-weighted with scholarly allusion and quotation , but always fluent , vivid , gracefully fashioned .

		To
Jeremy Taylor	PERSON	, whom he faithfully studied and whose biog - raphy he wrote , he appears to owe as much as to any one author , though many sentences savor unmis - takably of Sir
Thomas Browne	PERSON	.

		Wilmott is strong in the classics of
Greece	LOCATION	,
Rome	LOCATION	, and his own country , and is a writer good for us all to read in this day and generation , -- a task which is made easy and pleasant by this republication of his little master - piece .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		The '' Essays Speculative and Suggestive '' of
John Addington Symonds	PERSON	is one of the weightiest of that author 's many books .

		It was first published in
1890	DATE	, and reissued , with revisions , in
1893	DATE	, the year of the author 's death .

		Both editions have long been out of print , and we are glad to note the appearance of a third , under the supervision of Mr.
Horatio F. Brown	PERSON	.

		The Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	are the American pubUshers .

		Among the more recent works dealing with the career and character of
Mary Queen	PERSON	of Scots , few have deserved a better reception than the study by
Miss Florence Maccmm	ORGANIZATION	.

		As her work is of the popnlar type , the author makes no attempt at discussmg i '' detail all the various problems that rise about the remarkable personality of the Scotch queen ; her aun is to give a
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 21 picture of the queen and the woman -- vivid , sympa - thetic , but truthful .

		The book first appeared two years ago , but has recently been issued in a `` second and cheaper edition '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , which is , however , very satisfactory both as to presswork and illustrations .

		A new shilling monthly , '' The International , '' edited by Mr.
Rodolphe Broda	PERSON	, has been started by Mr.
T. Fisher Unwin	PERSON	.

		It seems to be a successor , vnth a more popular appeal , to the defunct '' Independent Review . ''

		The editor contributes a sociological i-eview of develop - ments all over the world , and his work is supplemented by brief contributions from a large number of local cor - respondents , and by a group of longer articles written by specialists .

		The publication as a whole stands strongly for the interests of social reform , and advo - cates numerous practical causes , such as woman suffrage and state interference with the conditions of labor , without much regard to their relation to fundamental principles .

		iNOTES .

		A text-book of '' Spanish Correspondence , '' by Mr.
E. S. HaiTison	PERSON	, is included among the recent educational publications of
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Romeo and Juliet '' is now added by the Messrs.
Crowell	PERSON	to their '' First Folio ''
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, as edited by the Misses
Charlotte Porter	PERSON	and
Helen A. Clarke	PERSON	.

		Robert IngersoU 's tribute to
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	, an interesting bit of shrewd and pathetic characterization , is now published in the form of a pretty booklet by the
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Messrs.
Charles H. Kerr & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish the second volume of
Karl Marx	PERSON	's `` Capital , '' as edited by Mr.
Frederick Engel	PERSON	and translated by Mr.

Walter T. Dunmore	PERSON	, is published by
Messrs. Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	as one of the ''
Hart	PERSON	,
Schaffner	PERSON	, and
Marx Prize Economic Essays	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Two new volumes in the '' Pocket Library '' of Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	give us , respectively , Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	's '' Ballads and Lyrics of Old
France	LOCATION	, '' and '' The Life and Death of
Jason	PERSON	, '' by
William Morris	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Alfred Bartlett	PERSON	publishes
Thoreau	ORGANIZATION	's essay on `` Friendship , '' extracted from the `` Week on the
Concord	LOCATION	and
Merrimack Rivers	PERSON	, '' in the form of a neat booklet , nicely fitted for use as a token of the quality whereof it discourses .

		A third edition of Mr.
Thomas Kirkup	PERSON	's '' An Inquiry into Socialism , '' first pubUshed in
1890	DATE	, is sent us by Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a small book , but more nearly adequate than many a larger one in presenting the essentials of its subject .

		That extremely valuable contribution to
Shakespear	PERSON	- ian scholarship , Dr.
D. H. Madden	PERSON	's `` The Diary of JVIaster
William Silence	PERSON	, '' has been reissued in a new edition , with an extensive new preface by the author .

		Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers .

		A set of five small volumes appears in the '' Handy Information Series '' of the Messrs.
Crowell	PERSON	.

		The titles are `` How to Play Golf '' ; a `` Handy Book of Synonyms '' ; `` How to Play Chess , '' by
Miss Charlotte Boardman Rogers	PERSON	; `` How to Keep Well , '' by Dr.

A. T. Lincoln	PERSON	and
J. H. Walton	PERSON	, Jr. , and an '' Introduction to Higher Algebra , '' by Professors
Maxime Bocher	PERSON	and
E. P. R. Duval	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Richard Bagot	PERSON	has written a charming little book on '' The Lakes of
Northern Italy	LOCATION	, '' which is now pub - lished by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It has many illustrations , and is something much better than a mere guide-book -- although it may serve as such -- being the work of an accomplished man of letters .

		A second series of Professor
Francis G. Peabody	PERSON	's '' Mornings in the
College Chapel	ORGANIZATION	'' is now published by
Messrs. Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		These short talks upon personal religion are admirable examples of brief and effective moralizing , and are well deserving of preserva - tion in their present printed form .

		The second volume -LRB- 1822-25 -RRB- of the Memoirs of
Alexandre Dumas	PERSON	, in Mr.
E. M. Waller	PERSON	's translation , is now published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The publishers also send forth in similar style two other
Dumas	PERSON	vol - umes -- '' The Crimes of
Urbaiu Grandier	PERSON	and Others '' and '' The Crimes of the Borgias and others '' -- a grew - some pair of holiday books .

		A volume of '' Specimens of Modern English Literary Criticism , '' edited by Professor
William T. Brewster	PERSON	, is published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The essays chosen are fifteen in number ,
Dryden	PERSON	and
Johnson	PERSON	being the only representatives of an earlier century than the nine - teenth .

		Poe 's '' The Philosophy of Composition '' is the only American example offered .

		NOTES 49 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 50 GOETHE -- THE OLD VIEW AND T HE NE
W. Lewes	PERSON	's life of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	is a landmark of our youth .

		It stands in memory like a mountain peak tinted from base to summit by the rays of the sinking sun , with crowns of colored clouds floating above it .

		It is the history of a con - queror , the epic of a god .

		Usually , literary biography , though fascinating , is sad , -- as mel - ancholy reading ,
Carlyle	PERSON	said , as the
Newgate Calendar	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is almost always the story of a great soul in paltry surroundings -- a record of struggles , aspirations , failures , partial successes , pitfaUs , a night landscape only relieved by flashes of lightning or the remote glory of the stars .

		But in
Lewes	LOCATION	everything is rose-color .

		Here is a Prince Fortunatus to whose cradle all the good fairies thronged .

		His life is a royal progress ; triumphal arches are erected every - where for him .

		The divinity is visible in him , and everyone recognizes it .

		Men give him their good offices and women their hearts .

		It is all too good to be true ; but it is eminently satis - fying , like a novel where everything happens just as we wish it should .

		The one feature of
Lewes	LOCATION	's book which per - haps gave it its vogue , and stiU thrills and inspires , is this : it is , apparently , the life of a free man .

		The most of us are boimd , are tied hand and foot by poverty , by duties , by custom ,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, according to
Lewes	LOCATION	, did just about as he pleased .

		We look up from our drudgery and slavery at this resplendent apparition , flawless in all its phases of dawn , or meridian power , or serene sunset glory ; and the spectacle does us good .

		That
Goethe	PERSON	used his liberty nobly , that he moved mainly in goodness , is only what we should expect , -- what we believe would happen to us were we relieved from the chains that hold us down .

		And there can be no question that
Lewes	LOCATION	hit upon the secret of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's life -- that
Goethe	PERSON	's main effort was to develop himself as a free agent , to rid himself of the bonds of custom , the tyranny of outside interference with His SeK .

		After
Lewes	LOCATION	, there came a long line of German biographers --
Grimm	PERSON	,
Diintzer	PERSON	, and the rest , for the most part painstaking , labori - ous , dull .

		To the true German , truth lies in a well , and for fear of missing the right fountain 30 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, they dig holes all over the country .

		These historians and commentators rescued many minor facts and truths about Goethe 's life ; but no one of their books gives any new or special inter - pretation of that life , or can pretend to rank as literature with
Lewes	LOCATION	s splendid and daring work .

		Now there comes a new biography , which has a definite intent , a novel interpretation , and one which , like
Lewes	LOCATION	's , is wrought to a single tone .

		The two are absolutely opposed .

		If Goethe in
Lewes	LOCATION	resembles
Guido	LOCATION	's picture of Dawn -- Apollo preceded by the fluttering Hours -- in Bielschowsky he is more like the drooping figure of the crucified Christ , lacerated and crowned with thorns .

		In
Lewes	LOCATION	, he is never sick or sorry or at fault .

		Bielschowsky shows him prostrated by grief and suffering , thwarted in his ambitions , flying from society in deep misanthropy , mis - understood by his friends , ignored by the public .

		He shows the man who claimed that in his whole life he had never had one week of happiness .

		He shows him like a Christian flagellant baring his back to the scourge because of his relations to women , revenging his lost loves by painting his own character in the darkest hues in the heroes of many of his plays and novels -- the weak
Weislingen	PERSON	, the cowardly
Clavigo	PERSON	, the unstable Egmont .

		Lewes is always up before the day to help Hyperion to his horse , but Bielschowsky dismounts his hero from his high steed and makes him walk the earth like the rest of us .

		It is the treatment of Euripides after that of ^ schylus .

		Instead of Orestes in his tragic mask and the Furies with their snaky hair , we get domestic scenes and
Electra	ORGANIZATION	at the wash-tub .

		Unquestionably ,
Bielschowsky	ORGANIZATION	's method of dealing with his subject is more human and more humane than that of
Lewes	LOCATION	.

		But is not his method a product of our present and possibly passing mode of thought ?

		Our age is anti- patrician -- it is resolute to do justice to woman , to the poor , to the lower animals .

		It finds a higher pathos , a greater grandeur in
Millet	LOCATION	's Potato-diggers than in
Marius	PERSON	brooding over the ruins of
Carthage	LOCATION	.

		It is doubtful whether such beliefs will hold .

		Greatness must regain its place in human imaginations .

		Take
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's entanglement with women , about which
Biel	PERSON	- schowsky does not spare him , and for which he represents Goethe as unsparing in self-condem - nation .

		Would any one of the girls or women whom
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	loved hftve chosen to have lost the Goethe episode out of her life ?

		His love was their crown of honor ; it brought them regard and consideration and immortality .

		One and all , they would have rejected with disdain the thought of parting with the memory of it .

		There is a legend in the
Ramayana	ORGANIZATION	so pat to this point that it is worth repeating .

		The Brides of
Indra	ORGANIZATION	, the god of the sky , grew weary of his love , -- alter - nating , as the sky does , with extremes of heat and cold , light and darkness , tempest and calm .

		So they ran away from him , and , descending to the earth , wandered long , until they came to the country of the Uttarakurus .

		Here they found a monotony of pleasing life .

		The climate was equable , so that they needed hardly any shelter , the trees yielded fruits at all seasons , the people were pleasant and unperturbed .

		They resigned themselves to the luxurious comfort of the place , and the days glided on , one like another .

		But presently the memory awoke in them of that old home , of the burning joy of
Indra	ORGANIZATION	's embraces , of the splendors , the tempests , the exultations and the agonies they had known .

		Their calm security and comfort became intolerable to them ; but , alas !

		they had exiled themselves from that loftier life .

		It is curious that while
Lewes	LOCATION	aggrandises and Bielschowsky minimizes the personality of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, the exact reverse is the case with their judgment on his literary work .

		Lewes 's criti - cism is cool , sane , temperate .

		He hardly admits any part of Goethe 's production , save the first haK of
Faust	LOCATION	and the lyrics , to be of supreme importance .

		Of Goethe as a dramatist , he says that with a large infusion of
Schiller	PERSON	's blood he might have been a Shakespeare .

		Bielschowsky writes with indiscriminate eulogy of everything that came from
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's hand .

		He is utterly without comparative criticism .

		Each piece is described , analyzed , judged as if it stood by itself in the world -- was the only specimen of its kind in existence .

		It seems to me that all opinion outside of
Germany	LOCATION	practically echoes the judgments of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's first biographer .

		Is it true , for instance , as Bielschowsky seems to urge , that '' Werther '' is a classic of high rank ?

		Historically , it is most important .

		It was the first prodigy of the storm and stress in
Germany	LOCATION	, and the parent of a vast brood of portentous monsters throughout
Europe	LOCATION	.

		But reading it to-day as a mere piece of liter - ature , it seems slight and trivial -- not to be compared with many preceeding or contemporan - eous English or French novels .

		Similarly , ''
Gotz von Berlichingen	PERSON	'' is a pioneer production in historical study , but it is certainly not equal in art and interest to much that has been done since ; `` Egmont , '' `` Tasso , '' '' Iphigenia , '' are admir - able dramatic studies , but they are not dramas .

		Bielschowsky analyses `` Hermann und
Dorothea	PERSON	' '
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAI .

		31 as if it were a new `` Iliad '' or `` Paradise Lost '' ; but charming as the poem is in its rich realism , it can claim only a place with the best modern idylls .

		Wordsworth surpasses it in profundity and
Tennyson	LOCATION	in beauty ; and ''
Paul	PERSON	and Vir - ginia , '' though in prose , has had a far wider success .

		The second part of '' Faust '' is good exercise for the wits of those people who take their poetry hard , but it is formless , amorphous , unfused .

		Probably Goethe 's greatest books , after '' Faust '' and the lyrics , are ''
Wilhelm Meister	PERSON	, '' `` Dichtung und Wahrheit , '' and the Conversations with
Eckermann	PERSON	.

		The creative power in the first two of these ranks Goethe with the greatest novelists -- hardly with the greatest poets .

		The criticism in
Eckermann	LOCATION	, and indeed throughout the multitude of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's papers and letters , makes him the first of the discursive type of critics .

		He had not the central ideas or the gift of sequence of Aristotle or
Lessing	PERSON	.

		And he had to the full the German power of platitude , the gift of discovering mare 's nests .

		There is a discussion of one of his own Marchen , in
Eckermann	LOCATION	, which is almost sublime in its solemn inanity .

		Goethe 's usual attitude toward his own work was one of unaffected modesty .

		He said of Mo - liere , `` It is well for little men like us to recur often to the works of the masters . ''

		And when his enemies tried to place
Tieck	PERSON	on a pedestal equal to his own , he said that the effort was as foolish as it would be for him to claim equality with
Shakespeare	PERSON	, who was an incomparably greater power than himseK .

		Yet there was a time when
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	exhibited a pomp and prodigality of creative force , an enthusiasm and fire , which bade fair to place him beside the greatest of all poets .

		In the
Frankfort	LOCATION	period , when the lyrics fell from his lips like the diamonds and pearls from the mouth of the maiden in the fairy tale , when '' Faust '' took form like autumn clouds collect - ing from the mist at the bidding of the wind ; when the fragments of '' Prometheus , '' '' Mahomet , '' '' The Wandering Jew , '' were whirled off like rings from a swiftly condensing nebula , -- then he was a great poet ; then he was all poet .

		Had he chosen to have kept on with this kind of pro- duction , had he dedicated his life to the
Muse	PERSON	, it is impossible to say to what heights he might have risen .

		But he took another path -- a path that led to decorations and power , and of course to temporary usefvdness and worldly duty well done .

		He became the Courtier , the Minister , and for many years poetry was little more than a pas - time for him .

		The Muse will stand anything -- except to be patronized .

		She wiU make up to a peasant like
Burns	PERSON	, or a thief like
Villon	PERSON	.

		You may beat her and starve her and quarrel with her , and she will be faithful .

		But treat her de haut en has and she flies your house .

		Goethe became the great man of affairs , and then the cool rationalizing student and critic of men and art ; but the inexplicable gleam of imagination , the inevitable speech of inspiration , left him , -- not all at once , but slowly and surely .

		He grew less and less a poet , as
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	grew more and more one .

		It is with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, of course , that he must be measured .

		He outranks all other modems , if only by reason of the wonderful dream reality of
Faust	LOCATION	.

		As compared with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, he utterly fails in the creation of men -- leaving out Mephistopheles , who is an improvement on lago .

		Shakespeare 's gallery of male portraits is unequalled in literature .

		From the highest to the lowest , from
King Lear	ORGANIZATION	and Hamlet to Falstaff and
Justice Shal	ORGANIZATION	- low , the whole range of human intellect , the whole exhibition of human character in action , are there .

		How can the weak and shambling fig - ures of Goethe -- Weislingen ,
Clavigo	LOCATION	,
Egmont	LOCATION	,
Wilhelm	PERSON	, Faust himself -- come into competi - tion with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's vital and virile types ?

		It is with his female creations that
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	runs Shakespeare hardest , -- and no one else in modern literature is in the race with them .

		He pierces perhaps as deep into the woman mystery as his predecessor , but he lacks his variety and splendor .

		Philina is as true a study of the baggage of easy virtue as Cressida or Cleopatra ; but how she pales ' beside them !

		Marguerite and ClJirchen are as impassioned and devoted as Juliet or
Imogen	PERSON	, but they are not as full and rich .

		And the type of womanhood which we associate most with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	-- the young girl , pure as crystal , but gay , daring , witty -- this is entirely out of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's list .

		In the gift of design -- the faculty that looks before and after , that fuses a work of art into one flaming whole , that tones it to one tune -- here -LRB- always omitting '' Faust '' -RRB-
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	is sadly to seek .

		Nearly all his works depend for their effect on single scenes or passages or characters half detached from the canvas .

		Nature worked more powerfully in Goethe than art .

		As he rejected the beliefs in design and special crea - tion in the world -- as he was an Evolutionist in science , a Neptunist rather than a Plutonist in geology -- so in literature he preferred to let his creations arise spontaneously from his mind , rather than consciously to mould and arrange 32 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, them for a predetermined effect .

		And in speech he preferred the ordinary sentences of human conversation to the buskined phrases of the trage - dians or the weighted and involved words of the epic poets .

		In all this he was the precursor of the modern school , and
Count Tolstoi	ORGANIZATION	and Mr.
Howells	PERSON	should rise up and call him blessed .

		But if we look back on literature we shall find that the things that have lasted best are those that have been best put together , that art and style are not negligible quantities .

		Goethe , indeed , strove after art and style with all his heart and soul , but he had not the instinct for them .

		The friends of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	will perhaps put most stress on his position as a teacher of mankind .

		And there is a vast amount of wisdom in his works -- wisdom of the sagacious , prudent , low - flying quality which we find in the essays of
Lord Bacon	PERSON	or the proverbs of Franklin . ''

		Here or nowhere is
America	LOCATION	'' is a remarkable say - ing -- but it would kill off the Columbuses . ''

		Let every man sweep the street before his own door '' is good sense -- but it is also narrow selfishness .

		On the other hand , there is through - out
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's works a high spirit , a noble - ness , a generosity and largeness of soul , both in the gnomic utterances and in the pictures of life , for which we look in vain in the literature of his more sober and prosaic rival .

		This pomp and prodigality of heaven must for all time appeal to the young , the ardent , the high - minded , while
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's sagacity will make him the favorite of those who do not expect too much of man or life .


Charles Leonard Moore	PERSON	.

		AN
UNPUBLISH ED L ETTER OF POE	ORGANIZATION	.

		An unpublished letter of
Edgar Allan Poe	PERSON	has come into the possession of
The Dial	ORGANIZATION	, which now gives it for the first time in print .

		The original letter is the property of Mrs.
A. H. Heulings	PERSON	, daughter of the late Rev.
Hastings Weld	PERSON	, long time the Rector at
Moorestown	LOCATION	,
New Jersey	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Weld	PERSON	in early life was a well-known poet , story-writer , and essay - ist .

		He was one of the band of bright men who made things lively and interesting in the journals and periodicals of the forties .

		His '' Corrected Proofs , '' a volume of light sketches and poems , has much the same quality as the work of
N. P. Willis	PERSON	.

		Later in life he edited a collection of religious poems , which was popular .

		He was co-editor with
Willis	PERSON	of '' Brother
Jonathan	PERSON	. ''

		One incident of his career is illustrative of the literary amenities of that day .

		In an article of his he had quoted a single stanza from a poem of
N. P. Willis	PERSON	.

		The latter sued him for fifty dollars !

		The
Poe	PERSON	letter is written on a single sheet of letter-paper in the poet 's clear and regular hand - writing .

		It is characteristically Poesque in its elab - orate courtesy and in the touch of temper at the end .

		Presumably Mr.
Weld	PERSON	had been attacking
Poe	PERSON	for some of his critical articles .

		The letter is as follows :
Philadelphia	LOCATION	,
August 14 , 1841	DATE	.


Hastings Weld	PERSON	,
Esqr.	LOCATION	, Dear Sir : -- The proprietor of a weekly paper in this city is about publishing an article -LRB- to be written partly by myself -RRB- on the subject of
American Autography	ORGANIZATION	.

		The design is three-fold : first , to give the Autograph signature -- that is , a fac-simile in woodcut -- of each of our most distinguished literati ; second , to maintain that the character is , to a certain extent , indicated by the chirography ; and thirdly , to embody , under each Auto - graph , some literary gossip about the individual , with a brief critical comment on his writings .

		My object in addressing you now is to request that you would favor me with your own Autograph , in a reply to this letter .

		I would be greatly obliged to you , also , could you make it convenient to give me a brief summary of yoiu '' literary career .

		We are still in want of the Autographs of
Sprague	LOCATION	,
Hoffman	PERSON	,
Dawes	PERSON	,
Bancroft	LOCATION	,
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Whittier	LOCATION	,
R. A. Locke	PERSON	, and
Stephens	PERSON	, the traveller .

		If among your papers you have the Autographs of either of these gentlemen -LRB- the signature will suffice -RRB- , and wiU permit me to have an engraving taken from it , I will endeavor to reciprocate the obligation in any manner which you may suggest .

		Should you grow weary , at any tune , of abusing me in the '' Jonathan '' for speaking what no man knows to be truth better than yourself , it would give me sincere pleasure to cultivate the friendship of the author of '' Corrected Proofs . ''

		In the meantime , I am Very respy .

		Yours ,
Edgar A. Poe	PERSON	.

		The signature of Mr.
Weld	PERSON	, and all but two of the others asked for in the article , -- whether fur - nished by Mr.
Weld	PERSON	or not , it is now impossible to say , -- duly appeared in the promised article .

		It was entitled '' A Chapter on Autography , '' was originally printed in three parts , and may be ex - amined in the standard edition of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's collected works .

		It reproduces in facsimile the autographs of a hundred literary celebrities of the day -- and in many cases of that day only .

		These signatures serve
Poe	PERSON	as tags on which to hang an equal num - ber of those snap-shot cock-sure literary judgments which it was always his delight to evolve .

		Indeed , so anxious is he to play the critic that the proof of his pet theory that the handwriting shows the man speedily becomes a minor matter ; and once at least -- in the case of Mr.
Rufus Dawes	PERSON	-- in his desire to characterize the author 's longer poems as '' pom - pous nonsense '' he ignores the question of chiro - graphy altogether .

		Most of the literati whose signatures appear in
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's article must have read it with considerable annoyance , unless they were blest with a sense of
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 33 humor strong enough to enjoy the extravagancies and contradictions of their critic 's temperament .

		Of
Washington	LOCATION	Irving he coolly says : `` Mr.
Irving	PERSON	has travelled much , has seen many vicissi - tudes , and has been so thoroughly satiated with fame as to grow slovenly in the performance of his literary tasks .

		This slovenliness has affected his handwriting .

		But even from his earlier manuscripts there is little to be gleaned , except the ideas of simplicity and precision . ''

		The manuscript of
W. C. Bryant	PERSON	, he admits with rather unusual candor , '' Puts us entirely at fault .

		It is one of the most common - place clerk 's hands which we ever encountered , and has no character about it beyond that of the day-book and the ledger ... The picturesque , to be sure , is equally deficient in his chirography and in his poetical productions . ''

		But it is when
Poe	PERSON	comes to
Emerson	LOCATION	, whose autograph he relegates to the very end of his article , that he is most diverting .

		Thus he flouts our
New England	LOCATION	Jove : '' His -LSB-
Emerson	PERSON	's -RSB- present role seems to be out-Carlyling Carlyle ... The best answer to his twaddle is cui bono ?

		... Several of his effusions appeared in the ' Western Messenger ' -- more in the ' Dial ' of which he is the soul -- or the sun -- or the shadow ... His manuscript is bad , sprawling , illeg - ible , and irregular -- although suflBciently bold .

		This latter trait may be , and no doubt is , only a portion of his general affectation . ''

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, in his book recounting his early experiences in
Boston	LOCATION	, records that on his first visit to
Emerson	LOCATION	he happened to mention
Poe	PERSON	, whereupon the philosopher , after a moment 's pause as though he were trying to recall the name , said , '' Oh , you mean the jingle man ? ''

		In this exchange of amen - ities ,
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's characterization certainly had the advantage of brevity ; but which was widest of the mark , it would be hard to say .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		Some fresh reminiscences of
Thackeray	PERSON	have been making their appearance in print of late .

		Mr.
Whitelaw Reid	PERSON	, though he never met the great novelist , was for years a sympathetic listener to stories about him .

		From the Old Centurions of
New York	LOCATION	, whose testimony was unanimous , he learned that
Thackeray	PERSON	was '' big , hearty , and very human . '' ''

		They did n't find him playing the lion the least little bit , '' adds Mr.
Reid	PERSON	, `` and we may hope he did n't find us playing the spread eagle too much .

		They pointed out the corner in the
Century Club	ORGANIZATION	where he used to sit exchanging literary chat , or , in Yankee parlance , ' swapping stories , ' with a group of clubmen about him .

		They could tell you years afterwards what had been
Thackeray	PERSON	's favorite chair , and some had even been so observant of the least trifles about the great man as to know what particular concoction in a club tumbler had been his favorite ' night-cap . ' ''

		The late Professor
Masson	PERSON	left some reminiscences , recorded by his daughter , which are now appearing in an English magazine .

		Of his early acquaintance with
Thackeray	PERSON	he speaks at some length , and incidentally tells a story touchingly illustrative of his kindness of heart .

		An Irish friend , an improvident fellow to whom he had lent money more often and more generously than he could well afford , at last begged his help in getting an article accepted by ''
Eraser	PERSON	's Mag - azine , '' to which
Thackeray	PERSON	regularly contributed .

		At considerable inconvenience , and only by withholding his own monthly contribution , the good-natured Englishman succeeded in gratifying the unthrifty Irishman .

		Soon after the article had been published , a correspondent ex - posed it as a gross piece of plagiarism , much to
Eraser	ORGANIZATION	's annoyance , and even more to
Thackeray	PERSON	's .

		But the light-hearted Celt , confronted with the proof of his literary rascality , only laughed heartily at it all as a good joke .

		And the man he had injured and deceived could not find it in his heart to give over loving him as a most delightful and typical specimen of the Hibernian .

		Things of this sort , added to what
EitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	has said of his old friend in his letters , make it impossible for us to doubt that there really once lived such a man as
William Makepeace Thackeray	PERSON	.

		• • • An English opinion of `` The American Lan - guage '' is entertainingly given in the current '' Book - man '' -LRB-
New York	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		Mr.
Charles Whibley	PERSON	, who has for about a year been making merry over the many strange things he saw and heard in this country , now delivers a criticism of our spoken idiom , which he finds curiously like , and at the same time curiously unlike , the lan - guage of his own land .

		Most surprising to us hurried and incoherent abusers of oral speech must be the Englishman 's discovery that ''
America	LOCATION	, with the true instinct of democracy , is determined to give all parts of speech an equal chance ... And so it is that the native American hangs upon the small words ; he does not clip and sheer the imimportant vocables , and what his tongue loses in colotu * it gains in distinctness . ''

		Yet , times without number , we have been told that we clip and sliu - , elide and suppress , maimijig and mangling our words beyond recognition ; and that we can not pronounce even the name of our country ,
America	LOCATION	, in all its four syllables .

		Mr.
Whibley	PERSON	, furthermore , denies that we speak through the nose : '' it is rather a drawl , '' he says , '' that afflicts the ear , than a nasal twang . ''

		Our slang and our love of hyperbole he dislikes , very natur - ally , and also our fondness for `` long , flat , cumulous collections of syllables , as ` locate , ' ` operate , ' ` antagonise , ' ' transportation , ' ' commutation , ' and ' proposition . ' ''

		Of these `` base coins of language , '' the last on the list he calls ''
America	LOCATION	's maid of all work , '' and adds that '' it means everythmg or nothing .

		It may be masculine , feminine , or neuter -- he , she , it .

		It is tough or firm , cold or warm , according to circumstances .

		But it has no more sense than an expletive , and its popularity is a clear proof of a starved imagination . ''

		Our picturesque '' fall '' -LRB- the season -RRB- he likes , but he shows himself a somewhat inacciuate observer in saying that '' autumn '' is unknown with us .

		Among reading Americans it is about as common as the shorter word .

		Our homely eighteenth-century manners are pleasantly pictm-ed in a rather remarkable diary of travel written -LRB- not for publication -RRB- by a certain
Alexander Hamilton	PERSON	,
M.D.	LOCATION	, and now printed in a limited edition for private circulation by Mr.
William K. Bixby	PERSON	, the
St. Louis	LOCATION	bibliophile , to whom a small circle of book-lovers are already indebted for various other literary , ijuriosities .

		Of Dr.
Hamilton	PERSON	little is known .

		Born in
Scotland	LOCATION	, and coming to this coimtry at some time after he had '' learnt pharmacy '' of an
Edinburgh	LOCATION	siu-geon , he settled at
Anna	LOCATION	- polis , where he practised his profession , but was forced by illness in
1744	DATE	to travel in search of health .

		Leaving home on the 30th of
May	DATE	he journeyed northeastward 34 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, in a leisurely and zigzag course as far as
Portsmouth	LOCATION	and New Castle , arriving home again on the
27th of September	DATE	, after covering a total distance of 1624 miles . ''

		Among the numerous joiu-nals and narratives of travel during the Colonial period , '' says Professor
Albert Bush	PERSON	-
nell Hart	PERSON	in a preface to the book , '' few are so lively and so full of good-humored comment on people and customs as the Itmerarium of Dr.
Hamilton	PERSON	. ''

		This is well ; for of unamiable pictures of early American civil - ization there is a sufficiency .

		Yet even our pleasant doctor was at times not exactly gallant toward the fair sex , though we need not judge of his conduct from the language of his diary .

		At
Albany	LOCATION	, he tells us , a friend '' introduced me into about twenty or thirty houses , where I went thro ' the farce of kissing most of the women , a manner of salutation which is expected from strangers coming there .

		This might almost pass for a penance , for the generality of women here , both old and young , are remarkably ugly . ''

		In
Philadelphia	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	he shows hmiself somewhat critical of the ladies ; but in
Boston	LOCATION	he deigned to be pleased with the daughters of a Mrs.
Blackater	PERSON	-- who was from
Scotland	LOCATION	, howeyer , wliich , perhaps , made all the difference .

		He finds fault , not unnaturally , with the night-cap as an article of daily wear .

		Worsted night-caps were common , and linen night-caps were '' much worn in all the • churches and meetings of
America	LOCATION	that I have been in , unless it be those of
Boston	LOCATION	, where they are more decent and polite in their dress . ''

		The visitor was amused at the embar - rassment of two Philadelphians who appeared at a
Boston	LOCATION	dinner in linen night-caps .

		These evidences of superior refinement and culture in the
Boston	LOCATION	of a hun - dred and sixty years ago are interesting .

		Whatever the rest of the country might have been ,
Boston	LOCATION	was no white-cotton-night-cap country .

		• • • The moving of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's boxes -LRB- despite the epitaphic curse pronounced upon the hardy digger of the poet 's dust -RRB- and the re-interment of those bones in
Westminster Abbey	LOCATION	is periodically agitated ; and this appears to be one of the periodical years .

		Not untimely in this connection are
Washington Irving	LOCATION	's words of nearly a century ago , to be foimd in his '' Sketch-Book . ''

		He says , toward the end of his essay on Stratford-on - Avon : '' As I crossed the bridge over the
Avon	LOCATION	on my return , I paused to contemplate the distant church in which the poet lies buried , and could not but exult in the malediction which has kept his ashes undisturbed in its quiet and hallowed vaults .

		What honour could his name have derived from being mmgled in dusty com - panionship with the epitaphs and escutcheons and venal eulogiums of a titled multitude ?

		What would a crowded corner in
Westminster Abbey	ORGANIZATION	have been , compared with this reverend pile , which seems to stand in beautiful loneliness as his sole mausoleum ! ''

		Even more perti - nent is an earlier passage in the same essay : it seems to prove the proposed scheme impossible , in addition to its undesirabUity . ''

		A few years ago , '' writes Irving , '' as some labourers were digging to make an adjoining vault , the earth caved in , so as to leave a vacant space almost like an arch , through which one might have reached into his grave .

		No one , however , presumed to meddle with the remains so awfully guarded by a male - diction , and lest any of the idle or the curious , or any collector of relics , should be tempted to commit depre - dations , the old sexton kept watch over the place for two days , vmtil the vault was finished and the aperture closed again .

		He told me that he had made bold to look in at the hole , but could see neither coffin nor bones ; nothing but dust . ''

		What visible and tangible '' remains , '' then , will there be to move , if the moving is ever at - tempted ?

		The difficulties of exhumation and identifi - cation recently encountered ui the
Druce Case	ORGANIZATION	are as nothing compared with such an attempt to dis-inter and re-bury , with due ceremony of solemn pomp , what is probably nothing now but a mouldy void , a mildewed emptiness .

		... Literature and journalism are neither mutually inclusive nor mutually exclusive ; but they are strangely jumbled and as strangely contrasted in a recent address by Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	before the
Institute of Journalists	ORGANIZATION	, in
London	LOCATION	.

		AU good literature he declares to be a form of journalism , made for the hour and destined , according to the laws of life and literature , to disappear with the hour .

		He also pronounces literature to be doomed and journalism destined to take its place , at the same time lamenting his fate in not being a journalist .

		Does he , by this lamentation , mean that his own books differ from '' all good literature '' in not being '' a form of journal - ism , destined to disappear with the hour '' ?

		Does he deplore such elements of permanent worth as may be contained in '' The
Time Machine	ORGANIZATION	, '' '' The War of the Worlds , '' and other ingenious romances of his ?

		This fabricator of more than up-to-date fiction protests against the blind worship of a dead past , calling it a '' cant of the day '' to depreciate the present in comparison with antiquity .

		The only difference he can see between liter - ature and journalism is that `` journalism does not pre - tend to immortality , and literature does '' ; and , further , he says that `` literature or classics are things of the past .

		We no longer produce them .

		The industry has died out '' -- and he is glad it has , apparently .

		For he asks , '' What is the typist , the city clerk , or the self - educated working-man to make of
Ben Jonson	PERSON	or ' The Faerie Queene ' ? ''

		Nothing , probably , if he is content to remain a mere typist or clerk or working-man .

		In one of his lectures ,
Thomas Davidson	PERSON	used to speak with hearty contempt of '' the self-satisfied smile of Philistine superiority '' with which many persons proclaim their indifference to the permanent things of the mind , their meaning simply being , '' We are stupid , low , grovelling fools , and we are proud of it . ''

		It is almost such a smile that we see on the lips of this praiser of things that '' disappear with the hour . ''

		The myth-making propensity of children is never more strongly appealed to than at the holiday season , in connection with the Santa-Claus fiction ; and annually there recurs the never-ending discussion , among well-meaning but unimaginative adults , whether the good saint ought to be allowed a longer lease of hfe .

		But a character so celebrated in song and story , and with so firm a hold on youthful fancy , may laugh defi - ance at these yearly threats to forbid his approach to the Christmas-eve stocking .

		The editor of a certain religious journal , far from joining in the outcry against
Santa Claus	LOCATION	as a promoter of pernicious make-believe and imtruth-telling , has a sensible word to say in his defense . ''

		There need be no difficulty in dealing with
Santa Claus	LOCATION	and the children , '' he declares , `` if one remembers that the children are natural poets and myth-makers ... We know a family in which for many years the plain truth about
Santa Claus	LOCATION	and Saint
Nicholas	PERSON	has been told , and yet the children have got all the pleasure that those mythical characters could give .

		In the presence of the children the father of the
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 35 family arrayed himself in fitting disguise as a venerable old man , and then , as he added the last touch , the chil - dren 's imagination did the rest , and he was , as by a miracle , changed before their eyes from the familiar person they knew into the Saint
Nicholas	PERSON	of tradition and story .

		The plan had several advantages : the truth was told , the children were delighted with their share in the transformation , and there was no after - thought of doubt and disappointment .

		Children are adepts in the art of make-believe , and resent it when their elders do not let them share the secrets of the process . ''

		It is a truism that the child dislikes to have his make-believe rendered too easy for him .

		He knows , or more often she knows , that the rag baby is put together out of calico and sawdust ; but it gives more genuine and lasting satisfaction than the finest wax doll from the toy-shop .

		The prosaic truth is all well enough in its own time and season ; but it does n't count in the land of make-believe .

		• • • A TWENTIETH-CENTURY DiCKENS is recognized by a noted French critic in the author of ''
Joseph Vance	PERSON	'' and '' Alice-for-Short . ''


M. T. de Wyzewa	PERSON	, writing in the Revue des Deux Mondes on '' The English Novel in
1907	DATE	, '' chooses one newer and several older novelists for comment and criticism .

		The newer one is Mr.
William De Morgan	PERSON	.

		Readers of Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's book on
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	will remember that he predicted the sur - vival of
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	's name and fame to the overshadowing of all other nineteenth-century English authors .

		The French critic inclines to agree with his English con - temporary in expecting
Dickens	PERSON	to have an increasmg vogue , and he hails with satisfaction a possible , or he would seem to say a probable , successor to his kingdom .

		The preeminently Dickensian quality of Mr.
De Morgan	PERSON	's two published works is , the Frenchman thinks , warmth .

		This fervor contrasts strongly with the more or less studied coldness of other current English novels .

		The author has his heart and head on fire while he creates , and the reader receives an indefinable sensation of heat .

		The characters and events are believed in by their creator , and readers are forced to believe in them too .

		M. de Wyzewa admits faults of style and execution , lack of originality in the adventures related , an absence of moral and psychological qualities of value in the books , -- in short , the stories have no precisely definable merits of any sort ; and yet he defies anyone to read them without an impression of tendre douceur of grace vivante , and of jeune gaite .

		This coronation of a suc - cessor to
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	is a little early -- more than a little early , in fact ; but perhaps the Frenchman 's removal in space from Anglo-Saxon soil may be accounted equivalent to a considerable remove in time from the present in which we ourselves judge of Mr.
De Morgan	PERSON	.

		A NEW TITLE TO INTELLECTUAL LEADERSHIP has been acquired by
Boston	LOCATION	in Senator
Tillman	PERSON	's assertion that it is `` the head-centre of all devilment . ''

		This '' golden opinion '' will do to go with the oft-repeated charge from less '' advanced '' districts that the home of Channing and
Parker	PERSON	and
Phillips Brooks	PERSON	is a running sore of skepticism in religion , a hotbed of heresy in the things of the faith .

		Over against this adverse criticism , however , as a
Boston	LOCATION	writer has recently pointed out , is to be set Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's well-considered opinion that '' most of our right-thinking , our high-thinking , still begins there -LSB- in
Boston	LOCATION	-RSB- and qualifies the thinking of the country at large .

		The good causes , the generous causes , are first befriended there . ''

		One likes to see that Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, though he long ago left
Boston	LOCATION	to try '' a hazard of new fortunes '' in
New York	LOCATION	, is still true to his early love , the city that greeted and smiled upon the young Western poet and romancer when he entered its gates m quest of fame and fortune .

		Nor must we forget that earlier devout tribute of
Emerson	LOCATION	's , con - tained -LRB- we believe -RRB- in a letter to
Whittier	LOCATION	, wherein he declared that when he opened his eyes in the morning and thanked God that he was alive , he also thanked him especially '' that I live so near
Boston	LOCATION	. ''

		* • • An English censorship of the press is suggested , curiously enough , just at the time when
England	LOCATION	is mak - ing a strenuous effort to disembarrass herself of her absurd and discredited censorship of the stage .

		And this proposed return to medifeval methods was the suggestion of no fanatical pulpit-pounder or religious enthusiast , but of an English author , and one too whose familiarity with stage folk and stage history must have inapressed him with the foolishness of dramatic censor - ship as now conducted in his own comitry .

		It was at an
Authors ' Club	ORGANIZATION	dinner in
London	LOCATION	that Mr.
Br	PERSON	am
Stoker	PERSON	put forward this plan of his , saying , in anticipation of objections , that it is always the thieves and Hooligans who cry '' Down with the police ! ''

		and it is the immoral writers who object to a censor .

		Not so altogether ; an innocent man does not enjoy being searched for stolen goods , and an inoffensive traveller is not made happy by having his trunk turned topsy-turvy in quest of dutiable articles which he has already declared it does not contain .

		Men can not be legislated into morality , nor will govern - mental paternalism hasten the coming of the millennium .

		• • • A famous and successful bookseller , whose namp is a household word to book-lovers , and whose rise from apprenticeship to mastership in his trade is as interesting as a romance , is made the subject , or a part of the sub - ject , of a current magazine article entitled ''
Bernard Quaritch	PERSON	and Others . ''

		Mr.
Quaritch	PERSON	, German by birth , came to
England	LOCATION	and served his apprenticeship under
Bohn	PERSON	-LRB- of blessed memory to unwilling delvers in classic lore -RRB- .

		When he decided to open a bookshop of his own , his master exclaimed with a snort : '' I like your impu - dence !

		I 'd have you know 1 'm the first bookseller in
England	LOCATION	. '' ''

		Yes , '' returned the unabashed junior , '' but I 'm going to be the first bookseller in
Europe	LOCATION	. ''

		And he was true to his word .

		Starting with next to no cap - ital , he soon became '' the boldest wolf in the pack . ''

		He let nothing escape him that he wanted .

		Money seemed to be no consideration with him when he was after a rare first edition or a precious manuscript .

		One of his
Mazarine Bibles	PERSON	he valued at eleven thousand pounds .

		• • • The retirement of a veteran French editor ,
M. Hienri Rochefort	PERSON	of
Ulntransigeant	LOCATION	, is announced .

		Tlie name of the paper , the very sound of it as heard in the newsboy 's shrill call , well denotes the character of its editor and his editorials .

		Aggressive and uncom - promising , he appeared to be never so much in his element as when vigorously assailing men in high places .

		It is not strange that he became familiar with prison life from the inside of stone walls and iron bars , that he passed some years in exile , and that he was challenged to many a passage at arms on the field of honor .

		Being now seventy-six years old , he may well feel entitled to a rest from his strenuous labors ; but lovers of a journal - istic style at once vigorous and picturesque will regret his relinquishment of the editorial pen .

Frederic Mistral	PERSON	's `` Mireio '' in
1859	DATE	,
Lamartine	PERSON	hailed its author , then only twenty-eight years old , as the Homer of his native land , and
Adolphe Dumas	PERSON	styled him the Virgil of
Provence	LOCATION	.

		Honors and titles have ever since been offered him -- some ac - cepted , but perhaps more refused -- and it was not long before his great epic enjoyed the distinction of translation into other and more widely known tongues .

		Miss
Harriet Waters Preston	PERSON	's English version , published in
Boston	LOCATION	in
1872	DATE	, has long been familiar to American and British readers .

		Of the poet himself , his fair land of
Provence	LOCATION	, its folk-lore and its dialect , much has been written , in periodicals and in books , by Miss Preston herself as weU as by Mr.
Janvier	PERSON	, Mr.
Arthur Symons	PERSON	, the PenneUs -LRB- collaborating with pen and pencil -RRB- , Mr.
C. T. Brooks	PERSON	,
Alphonse Daudet	PERSON	, and others .

		Of the movement known as Felihricje ^ started by
Joseph Roiunanille	PERSON	, but more properly and more closely associated with the name of
Mistral	LOCATION	, it may be well to give here a little account before taking up the early life of him who has made the word Felihre familiar to the reading world .

		In the '' Memoirs of Mistral , '' as translated by Miss Maud from the poet 's ''
Mes Origines	PERSON	, '' it is told how seven poets of
Provence	LOCATION	had assembled on the
21st of May , 1854	DATE	, in the full tide of
spring	DATE	and youth , at the chateau of Font-Segugne , when it was proposed , in view of the failure thus far of the young school of
Avignon	LOCATION	patriots to rehabilitate the Provencal tongue , that these seven should '' band together and take the enterprise in hand . '' '' '

		And now , ' said
Glaup	PERSON	, ' as we are forming a new body we must have a new name .

		The old one of ' min - strel ' will not do , as every rhymer , even he who has nothing to rhyme about , adopts it .

		That of troubadour is no better , for , appropriated to designate the poets of a certain period , it has been tarnished by abuse .

		We must find something new . ' ''

		Then I took up the speech . '

		My friends , ' said I , ' in an old country legend I believe we shall find the predestined name . '

		And I proceeded : ' His Reverence Saint-Anselme , reading and writing one day from the Holy Scriptures , was lifted up into the highest heaven .

		Seated near the Infant Christ he beheld the
Holy Virgin	LOCATION	.

		Having saluted the aged saint , the Blessed Virgin continued her discourse to her Infant Son , relat - * Memoirs of Mistral .

		ing how she came to suffer for His sake seven bitter wounds . '

		Here I omitted the recital of the wounds until I came to the following passage : ' The fourth wound that I suffered for Thee , O my precious Son , it was when I lost Thee , and seeking three days and three nights foimd Thee not imtil I entered the
Temple	ORGANIZATION	, where Thou wast disputing with the scribes of the Law , with the seven '' F ^ libres '' of the Law . ' ''

		At this phrase , '' the seven '
Felibres	PERSON	' of the Law , '' the seven young men cried out in chorus : '' Felibre is the name ! '

		Then followed , from one after another , the suggestion of various derivative terms , as '' felibrerie , '' to denote a branch of Felibres numbering not fewer than seven members ; '' felibriser , '' meaning to meet together as the seven at Font-Segugne were then doing ; '' felibree , '' a festival of Provencal poets ; '' felibreen , '' an adjective descriptive of the new association and its aims , and so on .

		The con - jectural derivation of Felihre ^ ivom faire and livre ^ may be referred to in passing .

		The task of compiling a dictionary of the Lancjue d ' Oc was assumed by Mistral himself , and completed after twenty years of devoted labor .

		Of this '' Treasury of the Felibres '' it has been said , by a competent judge : '' The history of a people is contained in this book .

		No one can ever know what devotion , knowledge , discrim - ination and intuition such a work represents , undertaken and concluded as it was during the twenty best years of a poet 's life .

		All the words of the Oc language in its seven different dialects , each one compared with its equivalent in the Latin tongue , all the proverbs and idioms of the South , together with every chai-acteristic expression either in use or long since out of vogue , make up this incomparable Thesaurus of a tenacious language , which is no more dead to-day than it was three hundred years ago , and which is now reconquering the hearts of all the faithful . ''

		But it is not for the completing of his dic - tionary that the world has of late had occasion to admire and applaud this poet-lexicographer ; but for his quiet refusal of a seat among the Immortals of the French Academy , when , con - trary to all precedent , the vacant chair was pressed upon him without previous solicitation on his part .

		Last year , too , he received the Nobel prize for patriotic literature -- a prize that has been devoted by him to the cause dearest to his heart as a citizen of
Provence	LOCATION	.

		The gift from
Sweden	LOCATION	has gone toward the pur - chase of an ancient palace in

Felibrean Museum	ORGANIZATION	, and to take the place of the small and inadequate building now occupied by the collection of Provencal antiquities and curiosities .

Master Francois Mistral	ORGANIZATION	stood in the midst of his cornfields watching the harvesters as they mowed down the crop with their sickles .

		A troop of women followed the labourers , gleaning the ears of corn which escaped the rake .

		Among them my father noticed one , a handsome girl , who lingered shyly behind as though afraid to glean like the rest .

		Going up to her he inquired : ' Who are you , pretty one ?

		What is your name ? ' '' '

		I am the daughter of
Etienne Poulinet	PERSON	, ' the young girl replied , ' the Mayor of Maillane .

		My name is Delaide . ' '' '

		Does the daughter of Master Poulinet , Mayor of Maillane , come , then , to glean ?

		` asked my father in surprise . ''

		` Sir , we are a large family , ' she answered , ` six daughters and two sons ; and our father , though he is fairly well off , when we ask him for pocket-money to buy pretty clothes , tells us we must go and earn it .

		That is why I have come here to glean . ' ''

		Six months after this meeting , which recalls the old bibhcal scene between
Ruth and Boaz	PERSON	, the brave yeoman asked the Mayor of Maillane for his daughter 's hand in marriage ; and I was born of their union . ''

		The scenes of country life and domestic happi - ness depicted in the Memoirs have all the fresh beauty and simplicity that might have been expected from the pen that drew them .

		The lack of any word for '' home '' in the French language , and the common but hasty inference that home-life also , at its best , is unknown to the people of
France	LOCATION	, seem strange enough to one reading again and again in French memoirs the homely and touching accounts of family life and family joys and sorrows .

		Taine 's early years at
Vouziers	ORGANIZATION	and the tender relations exist - ing between him and his mother have recently been described ; and now we have a still more charming picture of happy and affectionate domestic life in a Provencal farming com - munity .

		Equally effective is the writer 's pre - sentation of the primitive agricultural methods of those unsophisticated peasant farmers of a day that is fled .

		Before introducing the scene of peace and innocence that he associates with his boyhood , he refers with sorrow to the invasion of American methods and American machinery . ''

		Now at harvest time the plains are covered with a kind of monster spider and gigantic crab , which scratch up the ground with their claws , and cut down the grain with cutlasses , and bind the sheaves with wire ; then follow other monsters snorting steam , a sort of Tarascon dragon who seizes on the fallen wheat , cuts the straw , sifts the gram , and shakes out the ears of corn .

		All this is done in latest American style , a dull matter of business , with never a song to make toil a gladness , amid a whirl of noise , dust , and hideous smoke , and the constant dread , if you are not constantly on the watch , that the monster will snap off one of your limbs .

		This is Progress , the fatal Reaper , against whom it is useless to contend , bitter result of science , that tree of knowl - edge whose fruit is both good and evil .

		Contrast with this the simple ways of those earlier tillers of the soil of whom the poet 's father was one .

		The word `` corn `` is of course to be taken in the generic , not the specific or American , sense . ''

		As in the days of Cincinnatus ,
Cato	ORGANIZATION	, and
Virgil	PERSON	, we reaped with the sickle , the fingers of the right hand protected by a shield of twisted reeds or rushes ... Every day at dawn the reapers ranged themselves in line , and so soon as the chief had opened out a pathway through the cornfield all glistening with morning dew , they swungtheir blades , andas they slowly advanced down fell the golden com .

		The sheaf-binders , most of whom were young girls in the freshness of their youthfxil bloom , followed after , bending low over the fallen grain , laugh - ing and jesting with a gaiety it rejoiced one 's heart to see .

		Then as the sun appeared bathing the sky all rosy red and sending forth a glory of golden rays , the chief , raising high in the air his scythe , would cry , ' Hail to the new day , ' and all the scythes would follow suit .

		Having thus saluted the newly risen sun , again they fell to work , the cornfield bowing down as they advanced with rhythmic harmonious movement of their bare arms .

		... It was in this company , the grand sun of
Provence	LOCATION	streaming down on me as I lay full length beneath a willow-tree , that I learnt to pipe such songs as ' Les
Moissons	PERSON	' and others in ' Les lies d' Or . ' ''

		.

		Although the son of Master
Francois Mistral	PERSON	was sent away to learn his Latin and afterward to study law , he seems never for a moment to have proposed for himseK the practice of the profession for which he had made these prelim - inary studies .

		But rather , when he reached the age of one-and-twenty , it was his resolve '' first , to raise and revivify in
Provence	LOCATION	the sentiment of race that I saw being annihilated by the false and unnatural education of all the schools ^ secondly , to promote that resurrection by the restoration of the native and historic language of the country , against which the schools waged war to the death ; and lastly , to make that language popular by illuminating it with the divine flame of poetry . ''

		And on a later page he says : '' So it came to pass that I abandoned , once and for all , inflammatory politics , even as one casts off a burden on the road in order to walk more lightly , and from henceforth I gave myself up entirely to my country and my art -- 38 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, my
Provence	LOCATION	, from whom I had never received aught but pure joy . ''

		A high resolve , and nobly fulfiUed .

		The book has -LRB- to give it the highest of all praise -RRB- charm : it captivates the reader and holds his attention to the end .

		Miss
Maud	PERSON	's translation is smooth , but -- horresco ref evens -- not always grammatical . ''

		Mrs.
Harrison	PERSON	's interspersed and appended lyrics from the Provencal are skilfully executed .

		The portraits and other illustrations are many and good .


Percy F. Bicknell	PERSON	.

		Venice in the Golden Age .

		* We usually think of the so-called Renaissance as an age of creative intellect , an age that renewed the European world .

		The correctness of this view is beyond dispute ; still , all the achievements of the period were not construc - tive .

		We often forget that this same intellec - tual upheaval threw much of the old world into ruins .

		The passing of feudalism , with all that the term implies , the historian can contemplate without regret .

		That the characteristic ideals of the Middle Ages shoidd perish , is not strange and hardly to be deplored ; their day of useful - ness was over .

		But along with these much was destroyed that the world could ill afford to lose .

		Says Professor
Molmenti	PERSON	, in speaking of the Italian Renaissance : '' The excessive and exclusive passion for the redis - covered culture of
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	destroyed all religious sentiment , and converted the people of
Italy	LOCATION	into the most skeptical of European races .

		The exag - gerated devotion to the antique which animated courts , palaces , and streets , weakened the spirit of patriotism .

		The new learning ... distracted men 's minds from the active life of the nation ; and so , on the ruins of communal life , arose the despots . ''

		But to aU this ,
Venice	LOCATION	seems to be an exception .

		Venice had her share in the Renaissance : she had her
Aldus Manutius	ORGANIZATION	, her Titian , her Cabots , and hosts of others of lesser fame ; she had schools and libraries , poets and painters , build - ers and navigators .

		But the new movement did not overwhelm
Venice	LOCATION	; the city continued her independent cai'eer along the old lines , under the old constitution , busied more than ever with com - merce and conquest ; her golden age had begun .

		It is this age that Professor Molmenti dis - •
Venice	LOCATION	.

		Its Individual Growth from the Earliest Begin - nings to the Fall of the Eepublic .

		By
Pompeo Molmenti	PERSON	.

		Translated by
Horatio F. Brown	PERSON	.

		Part II. , The Golden Age .

		In two volumes .


Chicago	LOCATION	:
A. C. McClurg & Ck	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		cusses in the second section of his work on Venetian private life .

		In these volumes the plan is the same as in the earlier ones : a series of essays , each dealing with some phase of Venetian life and activity .

		As the period covered in this section is scarcely more than a century -LRB- roughly speaking , from 1450 to 1550 -RRB- , this plan can be carried out with greater success than in the work on the
Middle Ages	LOCATION	.

		Of par - ticidar interest are the chapters on municipal activities , such as measures affecting the public health -LRB- surely a problem in a city like
Venice	LOCATION	-RRB- and the embellishment of the city ; Venetian art and the private life of the artists ; the new move - ments in science and literature , including such subjects as schools , libraries , and the press ; the type of beauty in men and women , and family life in the upper and lower classes .

		In a large measure , therefore , the work desals with the forms in which the Renaissance expressed itself in
Venice	LOCATION	.

		It is further provided with a great number of excellent illustrations -- photographs showing the triumphs of the period in the indus - trial arts and architecture , and beautiful repro - ductions of the works of such masters in painting as
Titian	ORGANIZATION	,
Tintoretto	ORGANIZATION	, and
Paris Bordon	LOCATION	.

		We have said that
Venice	LOCATION	alone of the Italian cities seems to have survived the Renaissance ; but the survival is more apparent than real .

		Venetian grandeur in the fifteenth century was the culmination of centuries of effort , but it also marked the beginning of municipal and imperial decline .

		In the words of our historian , -- '' Beneath this dazzling exterior , even in
Venice	LOCATION	, the most powerful and flourishing state in the peninsula , the germs of corruption gradually made themselves mani - fest .

		Trade and industry came to be despised by the patricians and were left to the people , morals degen - erated , and the population which in
the first twenty years of the fifteenth century	DATE	numbered 190,000 souls steadily declined . ''

		Of special interest is the closing chapter of the work , '' The Corruption of Manners , '' in which the author gives us a detailed picture of moral depravity that is almost past belief .

		But the wealth , the power , the glory that had reacted so viciously on Venetian character was soon to pass : with the opening of the sixteenth century commercial decline becomes evident .

		For this , three reasons may be assigned : the newer ambitions for possessions on the mainland of
Italy	LOCATION	, in the pursuit of which the resources of the city were dissipated ; the discovery of the new route to
Asia	LOCATION	which established com - petition all along the western coast of
Europe	LOCATION	and condemned the
Adriatic	LOCATION	trade to a slow but sure death ; and , lastly , the losses to the Turks in

		THE DIAL .

		39 the
Archipelago	LOCATION	and along the Dalmatian coast which shattered the prestige of the
Venetian navy	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is interesting to note that in
1502	DATE	the Venetian government , realizing the new state of affairs , proposed to the Soldan of
Egypt	LOCATION	that a canal be cut through the Isthmus of
Suez	ORGANIZATION	.

		The historical writer who delights in the picturesque can hardly find a more congenial subject than
Venice	LOCATION	at the opening of the mod - ern age ; it is a theme that ought to call out his best energies .

		But when we come to consider how the author and the translator in the present case have done their work , we confess to a feeling of disappointment .

		As in the earlier volumes the defect that strikes one first is the inadequate translation .

		The author quotes quite freely from his sources , and all such extracts the translator has left in the original .

		Frequently the reader strikes an entire page where English is almost wanting ; consequently , to the student who knows no Italian the work is of doubtful value .

		At times the reader is left with the feeling that the author has not wholly mastered his materials , that the quality of discrimination is wanting .

		In his effort to mention all who have achieved prominence in any given field , the author often fails to give us anything but a mere list of names .

		In one case , nearly fifty artists are named on a single page -LRB- I. , 101 -RRB- ; many such pages make didl reading .

		Still , on the whole the work is neither dull nor dry ; on the contrary , the style is often so florid and exuberant as to provoke amusement .

		In many respects these volumes are an improvement on the earlier ones ; but in the study of a single century so rich in sources as that which fol - lowed the invention of printing , we should expect a more positive expression of historical virtues than in a work covering nearly a thou - sand years and based on the sometimes dreary and often fragmentary annals of the Middle Ages .

		Socialism condemned .

		* As Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	explains in a prefatory note to his '' Critical Examination of Socialism , '' he was invited in the
autumn of 1906	DATE	to deliver a series of addresses on the subject of Socialism , in
America	LOCATION	.

		Most of us have already heard or read a good deal about the things Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	said and did in this country ; and no doubt enough interest has been aroused to ensure his book a large circtdation .

		It may also be anti- cipated that of those who take up the volume most will read it through ; for the author , what - ever else may be said of him , is not dull .

		The main argument , so far as it may be con - densed into a few words , is as follows : Manual labor is not the source of all wealth ; in parti - cular , its effects are increased many fold by directive ability , including in this term invention as well as the immediate application of directive intelligence to industrial operations .

		It is evi - dent from the work of craftsmen in ancient times , that manual skill has not sensibly in - creased for many centuries , and hence the great additions to wealth now realized by human effort must be due to directive ability .

		It follows that inasmuch as this ability is exercised by the few , and yet is responsible for more than half the output , ordinary labor is not only not deprived of any of its just share , but actually receives much more than it would be entitled to on prin - ciples of abstract justice .

		It also follows that if directive ability were not exercised , and if there were not means to compel the mass of workers to submit to it , the product of labor would rapidly fall , and the whole country would be impoverished .

		Those who are conscious of special ability will not as a rule exercise it unless given sufficient inducements to do so .

		The pos - sibility of acquiring wealth and power affords such an inducement in the modem world , and attracts to the management of industry such abilities as would in earlier times have been given to aggressive war and other non-productive enterprises .

		At the same time , those who engage in production are compelled to be serviceable to mankind at large , for if their product is unsatis - factory , actually or relatively , the public will not pay for it , and the business fails .

		To dimin - ish seriously the rewards of directive ability would be disastrous , as it might cause much of this ability to be withdrawn from industrial enterprises .

		To free the workers from obliga - tion to obey the commands of those over them * A Critical Examination of Socialism .


New York	LOCATION	:
Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	.

		ByW.H.MaUock .

		40 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, would be equally disastrous , as it is only by submitting to such commands that production can be kept up to the present level or increased .

		Hence some form of '' wage slavery , '' so-caUed , is inevitable , and the so-called '' unearned incre - ment '' is not taken from those who had any - thing to do with its production .

		The manage - ment of industry by the
State	ORGANIZATION	would necessarily amount to this , that in place of various separate corporations there would be substituted one great one , against the operations of which there woidd be no appeal , and the success of which would not be checked in every detail by com - parison with other like enterprises .

		Some indication is given throughout the vol - ume of the criticisms made by Socialists at the time the addresses were delivered .

		The matter is complicated by the fact that there is great diversity among the Socialists themselves con - cerning their doctrines ; no doubt even more diversity than there is among non-Socialists about practical politics , inasmuch as ideals are not kept within the narrow bounds prescribed by actual conditions .

		It is unfortunate , though no doubt inseparable from the authorship , that the criticisms of other writers , great and small , are given in the most arrogant and unsympa - thetic spirit , and hence tend to provoke oppo - sition rather than an effort to come to some reasonable imderstanding .

		One does not need to be a Socialist to feel continually that argu - ments are overstrained and facts ignored .

		All must agree with the proposition that modem human society needs all the ability , manual or otherwise , which it can command for the pur - poses of useful production .

		It is equally evi - dent that this ability will not be forthcoming without suitable stimuli , and no one doubts that it is one of the principal cares of organized man - kind to provide such stimuli in proper amount and kind .

		The practical question is , granting organized industry , how shaU individuals be so stimulated that their reactions will result in the greatest good to themselves and their fellows ?

		In the case of any other species but
Homo sapiens	PERSON	, the answer is relatively simple , because the stimuli and reactions are normally very con - stant , and practically the same for all .

		The choice of good and evil , given to man .

		is indeed a dangerous weapon , as well as a means of incalcu - lable advantage .

		Judges we are , however , and we find ourselves in the position of having to de - cide what lines of conduct are to be encouraged , what repressed .

		The rough and ready methods of modern capitalism do indeed have their influence upon conduct , and in many respects this influence is unquestionably beneficial .

		It is nevertheless a most hopeful sign that men are coming more and more to see that a far greater measure of justice and economy , and ultimately of happiness , is attainable ; and having come to this conclusion , are determined to further its attainment .

		The most obvious objection to Mr.
MaUock	PERSON	's position , and the most fundamental , concerns his assumption that to-day superior ability is suitably rewarded , having regard to its services .

		If any - one will consider for a moment the history and present status of , let us say , the industries con - nected with electricity , it wiU be apparent that the relation between service and reward is of the loosest possible kind .

		Mr.
MaUock	PERSON	freely recog - nizes invention as part of '' directive ability , '' whether the ideas formulated are carried out at the time , or long after ; and it is well known that the various applications of electricity , like practically all applications of scientific discovery , rest upon the work of generations of men , many of whom never lived to know the economic value of their work , or receive the commensurate rewards .

		To argue that those who finally bring this work to the point of productivity are to be regarded for practical purposes as the producers of the new wealth , is to take an absurdly narrow view .

		Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	reasons that if we choose we may remove the '' cause '' of anjiihing indefi - nitely , and that for practical ends we treat the proximate causes as real ones ; and in particu - lar , must so treat those over which we have any control .

		This is somid enough , but it requires little imagination to see that of all the controlla - ble causes contributing to the advancement of production , the researches of science , prior to any possibility of commercial profit , are of the most fundamental importance .

		Passing over this phase of the matter , however , we find ourselves asking whether as a matter of fact the most useful mem - bers of society , having regard to the immediate residts of their labors , are the most encouraged , and particularly whether pernicious activities of various kinds are adequately checked .

		It hardly seems possible to me that any thoughtful person , socialist or otherwise , can be satisfied with Mr.
MaUock	PERSON	's treatment of these questions .

		An ideal human society , so far as I am able to imagine it , would be one in which all the individuals were usefully and happily occupied , each one in the manner most profitable , having regard both to his nature and the needs of his fellows .

		That all woidd have the means neces - sary for life and work needs scarcely to be postulated , as without it the first condition could not obtain .

		In such a society the rich man
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 41 would be the one capable of using more than most of his fellows , whether of materials or of service , or both .

		Organization would be carried to a high pitch , no doubt ; but constant effort would be made to avoid sacrificing the man for the sake of increased production , as is habitually done to-day .

		It would remain , as it is to-day , a constant problem to secure a rational equilib - rium between the tendency to uniformity pro- moted by the majority , and the nonconformist activities of individuals and groups .

		This antag - onism is woven into the very fabric of our existence , and without it life would sink below the level of rational consciousness .

		Similarly , as the bud waits for the stimulus of the sun 's rays , so every individual would depend for proper development upon awakening forces , some provided by nature , others furnished , con - sciously or otherwise , by his fellows .

		That the man-made inducements to the exercise of '' direc - tive ability '' need be of the gross and often demoralizing character that they are in present - day industrial life is as absurd a proposition as one which might have been put forward in less civilized times , that no healthy man could be happy without adequate opportunities for com - mitting murder .

		It is not contended that the question of stimuli is a simple one ; on the con - trary , it is one of the most difficult , involving , with the responses , the whole matter of the interrelations of human beings and the conse - quent interest of human life .

		The truth is , that Socialism does not imply a state of society wholly different from the present ; nor is it a means of escaping the basic problems and difficulties which vex us to-day .

		Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	himself says that '' Socialism , no matter how false as a theory of society , and , no matter how impracticable as a social programme , will have called attention to evils which might otherwise have escaped attention , or been rele - gated to the class of evils for which no allevi - ation is possible . ''

		If Socialists are themselves of diverse opinions , if they remain vague as to details of their programme , these things need not be regretted , for there is thereby assured a plasticity which will permit adaptations to the various conditions arising in the course of social evolution .

		In attacking the theories advanced , Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	has done a good service .

		On the purely intellectual side , his criticisms , valid or otherwise , will arouse fruitful thought and dis - cussion ; but though we must admit that he justly accuses many socialists of improperly prejudicing the subject , we can not acquit him of this same fault .

		Ax ENGI.ISH IjIFE of TASSO .

		* In attempting a new biography of
Torquato Tasso	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
William Boulting	PERSON	had a golden opportunity .

		Off the Continent , the field was free and virtually untrodden .

		The most recent life in English , an essay by
Mary C. PhUlimore	PERSON	, appeared over twenty years ago .

		The better - known work of
Milman	PERSON	-LRB- 1850 -RRB- and the life by
Henry Wilde	PERSON	-LRB- 1848 -RRB- have long been hope - lessly antiquated .

		Meanwhile the unwearied researches of the Italians , above all
Mazzoni	PERSON	and
Solerti	PERSON	, not to speak of subtle interpretations by such men as
Carducci	PERSON	and Nencione , or to mention an array of monographs in
France	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	, have given substance and pre - cision to the meagre outline , inaccurate and misleading , that used to pass for a biography of Tasso , and have gone far toward putting him and his poetry into something like true relations with the age that begot them .

		To present the results merely of Italian scholarship and criticism , to give us in succinct and readable English an accoimt of the author of '' Jerusalem Delivered '' as he is now known in his own country , and to do this in such fashion that we might be sure the picture was true both in the single details and in the sum of them , was , for a literary man , the chance of a lifetime .

		This was Mr.
Boulting	PERSON	's chance .

		How has he accepted it ?

		So far as we can judge , he has proceeded as follows : he has read his authorities with atten - tion though not with a high degree of scholarly acumen , has gathered excerpts and quotations liberally , though in the main without anxiety to recall the particular sources from which they were copied , and then , with a certain impetus and abandon , -- cutting his bridges , so to speak , behind him , -- he has marched rapidly through the enemy 's domain .

		The enemy means the devotee of minute scholarship -- the dunderheads whose love for Tasso has been so thorough that they have spent decades in quest of the slightest shreds of truth about him , when any one of them might have written a popular life of him in a tenth of the time .

		Their stores Mr.
Boulting	PERSON	has not been loth to ransack , while treating the owners with apparent disdain .

		Of the four foot-notes throughout his 307 pages of text , only one refers to any author who has written on Tasso , and that one to
Milman	PERSON	.

		We should have been better satisfied if Mr.
Boulting	PERSON	had every - where specifically indicated his indebtedness to * Tasso and his Times .

		42 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, the fifty-three works cited in his Bibliography -LRB- pp. 309 , 310 -RRB- ; for however the absence of such indication may appeal to the author , it strikes the conscientious reader as a serious and baffling omission .

		In consequence of the omission , one is priv - ileged to estimate the volume in part by its attitude toward scholarship and life in general . ''

		Most scholars , '' we learn on page 53 , '' are men of narrow if not mediocre intelligence , '' locking themselves up '' in pedantry , '' and en - deavoring '' to impose their own fetters on men of real life and spirit . ''

		This , though said -LRB- or rather because it is said -RRB- incidentally , is signi - ficant enough , and needs no comment .

		Again , here is an edifying view of life , in the portrayal of a Venetian marriage -LRB- p. 46 -RRB- : `` Two young people are made one : probably they will learn to love one another -LSB- each other ? -RSB-

		as indif - ferently well or hate one another with much the same fervor as other married folk ; at present they are almost strangers . ''

		What , one would like to know , has that sort of twaddle to do with Tasso ?

		Wherever it is found , in
Lord Chesterfield	LOCATION	's Letters or out of them , one is bound to stamp it as untrue to life , and vulgar .

		The habit of judging by vul - gar averages leads on to a form of cynicism , which is ordinarily condoned , in the considera - tion of the highest intepreters of life , the philo - sophers and poets -LRB- pp. 186 , 194 -RRB- .

		Philosophers , we are told , '' have rarely been noted for practical wisdom . ' '

		Neither has the midtitude in any other walk .

		But how about
Plato	ORGANIZATION	,
Aristotle	LOCATION	,
Bacon	LOCATION	,
Leibnitz	PERSON	?

		As for the poets , -- the pale dubious presence of an unnamable renaissance vice '' is reflected in the sonnets of what is , perhaps , the healthiest mind of all time . ''

		Fortunately , not the average , but the best expositor of Shake - peare 's Sonnets ,
Canon Beeching	ORGANIZATION	, finds reflected in them the lovely sentiment of a
David	PERSON	for a Jonathan , something , humanly speaking , like the friendship disclosed in the twenty-first chapter of the
Fourth Gospel	ORGANIZATION	.

		These bits of worldly wisdom on scholars , married life , philosophers , and the like , are , of course , obiter dicta , bearing but a fractional proportion to the whole work ; yet it would be too much to expect that their animus does not impair the tone of an otherwise welcome narra - tive .

		Judged by an average standard , Mr.
Boulting	PERSON	's '' Tasso and His Times '' is a read - able book , full of interesting history and bio - graphical information with which few will be likely to quarrel .

		The author seems to know his
Italy	LOCATION	well at first hand , and there is no question of his ability to imagine himself in the historical backgi'ound that he describes , or of his sympathy for his central figure ,
Tasso	ORGANIZATION	.

		His book is wi'itten in what is often a vivacious style , suffering , it is true , from frequent overloading of detail in an effort to heap up incidents that are picturesque , and marred now and then by the pathetic fallacy -LRB- as on page 1 -RRB- in descriptions of external nature ; yet bound to be considered the foremost work on the subject in English -- until someone with a better understanding for scholarship and its relation to all forms of lit - erature , including poetry and popular biography , shall appear in
America	LOCATION	or
Great Britain	LOCATION	, to unite his own researches , painful and circum - spect , with the labors of
Continental	ORGANIZATION	authorities on Tasso , and to illumine the whole with that optimistic and humanizing spirit which is the true effulgence of scholarship , philosophy , and poetry .

		Something remains to be said about the externals of the volume .

		The printing is gen - erally so accurate that a slip on the title-page -LRB- Simondi for Sismondi -RRB- is almost as annoying as the misquotation from
Wordsworth	PERSON	at the bottom of page 137 .

		The twenty-four illus - trations , beginning with the Uffizi portrait of Tasso and ending with ''
Tasso	PERSON	's Oak '' on page 302 , are nothing less than admirable .

		The book is well worth having if only for the pictures .

		Allowance made for the sort of faults which I have tried to suggest , it is well worth having in any case .

		Its merits are more obvious , and do not seem to demand an extended rehearsal .

		It is unquestionably opportune .

		Readers who delight in curious and out-of-the-way knowledge will enjoy the two volumes of the

		They are small books , well made and illustrated .

Hudson	LOCATION	, begiiming with a sketch of
Robert Fulton	PERSON	and his invention of the steamboat , his monopoly and its downfall through the famous decision of
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	in the case of
Gibbons vs. Ogden	ORGANIZATION	.

		The author traces the improvement of the boats , with their names and those of their captains , up to the great passenger steamers of the present day .

		The many pictures of these boats are perhaps the most interesting feature of the book .

		Mr.
Todd	PERSON	's volume consists of a collection of sketches and articles , most of them written many years ago .

		THE DIAL 43 Rkcext FlC ^ TIOIf .

		* Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	is nothing if not versatile , and it should be no surprise to his readers to discover that his new novel is an English tale of the Regency period , and that it reproduces the life of
England	LOCATION	a hundred years ago with extraordinary vividness and verisimilitude .

		`` The Stooping Lady '' is its title , and the heroine thus described is a truly adorable creature .

		She stoops indeed , but only to conquer , and the mesalliance to which she condescends se - cures her in the affections of every reader of generous impulses , although it horrifies her own aristocratic circle .

		For Ladj ^
Hermia	LOCATION	, brought from a girlhood spent in Irish wilds to shine in
London	LOCATION	society , and eventually to make a match suitable to her station and lineage , looks coldly upon all the noble gentle - men who sue for her hand , and bestows her favor upon a young man good to look at , but a butcher by trade and a radical by political bent .

		This marvel results from his good luck in becoming the victim of gross injustice at the hands of her family , and thereby attracting the attention and winning the commiseration of the heroine .

		From the sympathy thus stirred to the love later awakened is but a step , and her capitulation is the consequence of a siege carried on by absurdly simple means .

		For some months the hero keeps entirely out of her sight , but all the more in her mind because of the bunch of white violets he sends her daily , no matter where she may be .

		The cumulative effect proves irresist - ible ; and when she makes surrender , it is complete .

		Then tragedy intervenes , and a chance pistol shot puts an end to the man 's life and the woman 's hap - piness .

		We are unprepared for this consummation , and it seems rather wanton ; probably the author believed it necessary to give artistic completeness to Lady
Hermia	LOCATION	's experience and to his delineation of her character .

		We need hardly add that this story has a distinction that sets it far apart from fiction in the ordinary sense , and insures for it something like permanence in our literature .

		the same place among our novelists as was occupied a few years ago by
Heniy Seton Merriman	ORGANIZATION	.

		He has much the same neatness of technique , the same versatility , and the same constructive ability .

		One may take up almost any of his later books with the assurance that it will offer agreeable entertainment by means of a logically coherent narrative , and will be found almost wholly free from surplusage .

		His latest novel , '' The Broken Road , '' has for its scene one of the smaller protected States of
India	LOCATION	, and for its main subject a native uprising which seems to threaten , on a small scale , a repetition of the horrors of the Mutiny .

		The hereditary prince of this
State	ORGANIZATION	is a young man who has been sent to
England	LOCATION	as a child , and educated at
Eton	ORGANIZATION	and
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		He has acquired the veneer of European culture , and tries to think of himself as an Englishman .

		But when he returns to
India	LOCATION	, he learns , with much bittterness of soul , the lesson of his racial inferiority .

		Having fallen in love with an Englishwoman -LRB- who has rather encouraged his advances -RRB- , he discovers that his aspirations make him an object of derision , -- that a '' nigger , '' though he be a prince , must know his place .

		Thereupon he becomes once more an Oriental , and enlists as the leader of the fanatical agitators who are fomenting rebellion against English rule .

		The plan fails , and he is driven into exile ; but it provides us with some exciting moments .

		Mr.
Mason	PERSON	's work is fairly comparable with that of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	and Mrs. Steel in the same field , and has the same essential message -- the teaching that the Asiatic can no more change his nature than the leopard his spots , and that the European can never understand his actions because he can never appre - ciate the motives from which they
spring	DATE	.

		The eccentric-pathetic type of character , projected into modern literature by
Cervantes	PERSON	, has been illus - trated for us more than once by the inventions of Mr.
Quiller-Couch	PERSON	.

		We may again find it exempli - fied , in a very humble way , in the titular character of his '' Major Vigoureux , '' This faithful old soldier , after the wars are over , is placed in charge of a military post on one of the
Channel Islands	ORGANIZATION	.

		For years all goes well , and then he is dealt a blow in the shape of an official order withdrawing the gar - rison and dismantling the battery .

		He himself is not included in the order , and so he remains at his post and upon the pay-roll of the War Office , but the glory has departed from his life , and he is all the time haunted by a miserable suspicion that his retention in the service is only an oversight , and that he may be turned adrift at any moment .

		This is a suggestion of his character , and this is the situation which we find at the beginning of his story as Mr.
Quiller-Couch	PERSON	has related it for us .

		Many things happen as the story goes on , and they prove well worth the chronicling , but we will not attempt to set them forth .

		The author 's capricious fancy and rich humor are familiar to all his readers , whom we are content to notify that '' Major Vigoureux '' is fully as entertaining and human a book as any of the long series of its predecessors .

		44 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, We had occasion to bestow cordial praise , some months ago , upon a novel of Southern life entitled `` The Invisible Bond . ''

		It now appears that the author , Miss
Eleanor Talbot Kinkead	PERSON	, planned the book as the first section of a trilogy having for its purpose the presentation of '' the three great funda - mental relations of life . ''

		The relation of man toward woman was its theme , and the action revolved about a case of divorce .

		The relation of man toward humanity and the relation of the individual toward the divine were the two themes left to be portrayed by concrete examples in the remaining sections of the trilogy .

		The first of these two is now dealt with in `` The Courage of
Blackburn Blair	PERSON	, '' a modern instance of moral heroism brought into close relations with the
Goebel	PERSON	campaign that convulsed
Kentucky	LOCATION	a few years ago .

		The hero is a young lawyer and politician who realizes how false is that conception of personal honor which in
Kentucky	LOCATION	, and in the South generally , requires a man who is insulted to commit a murder for the vindication of his character .

		Early in the narrative he voices his protest against the iniquity of this unwritten social law , and says that the man who should dare to brave it '' would be a saviour to his people . ''

		The words are of prophetic import , for
Blackburn Blair	ORGANIZATION	is himself destined to be put to the test , and when it comes , his conscience triumphs over the exactions of the code and he bears patiently the resulting imputation of cowardice .

		It is hard to endure the political disfavor and the social ostracism that are his immediate reward ; it is harder still to discover that his restraint causes the girl he loves to shrink from him .

		But in the end he gives convincing proof that he is no coward , and some dim notion of the splendid moral heroism he has shown throughout becomes perceptible even to the minds of his enemies .

		The fine idealism of this book , to say nothing of its many other admirable qualities , gives it a high place among the novels of the year .

		`` The Jessop Bequest , '' by Miss
Anna Robeson Burr	PERSON	, offers a case of conscience .

		The case is a perfectly clear one , for it is nothing less than the retention by the heroine of a fortune that really belongs to a philanthropic society .

		It all hangs upon the date upon which the heroine 's mother died .

		By means of trickery and false affidavits the date is set a few days ahead , and the fortune diverted to the daughter .

		We should say at once that the heroine knows nothing of this , and that the fraud is charge - able to the leading politician of the town -LRB- who wishes to marry the girl -RRB- with the connivance of her grand - father , an amiable clergyman of weak character and wobbly morals .

		When the heroine learns the facts , she at once renounces the personal benefits of her fortune , and insists that her grandfather shall make restitution .

		Since he has already squandered a con - siderable part of the property , he can not meet her demand at once , and pleads for time .

		This device permits the story to run on long enough for the heroine to win fame as an artist , and long enough also for the development of the somewhat anaemic love interest .

		It is a well-written story in point of style , but exhibits a low degree of vitality , and is burdened with much inconsequential detail .

		Miss
Elizabeth Robins	PERSON	-LRB- Mrs.
Parkes	PERSON	-RRB- is an accom - plished novelist whose work we have often praised ; but we can not congratulate her upon '' The Convert , '' which is not a novel in any real sense , but a hyster - ical tract in advocacy of woman 's suffrage .

		We do not object to a certain amount of veiled didacticism in a work of fiction , but in this case zeal gets the better of discretion , and the book is as much an offence against literai * y good manners as are the actions of the '' suffragettes '' which it defends an offence against every sane ideal of social seemliness .

		The mark of the fanatic is upon every page , and nothing that might be called '' sweet reasonableness '' is anywhere apparent .

		The cause that needs to be espoused in such fashion as this in order to attract attention is in a bad way indeed .

		A struggle for the control of a railway company , the abduction of a magnate who is held untU he comes to terms , the kidnapping of a boy , a train robbery , and a mysterious Chinese episode , are a few of the matters which engage our attention in '' The Lion 's Share , '' Miss Alice French 's new novel .

		To these , the
San Francisco	LOCATION	earthquake is added as an effective climax .

		We do not pretend to understand what the story is all about , or just how its episodes and characters are related , but we can testify to its possession of an interest which is continuous if not coherent .

		The author , who can be a real novelist when she tries , would be the last person in the world to expect us to take this preposterous invention seri - ously .

		Its purpose is entertainment of the lightest sort , and this it gives us in full measure .

		We have previously had occasion to speak in terms of praise concerning Mr.
Harold Bindloss	PERSON	, both for his skill in combining romantic sentiment with a rather grim sort of , actuality , and for the freshness of interest imparted to his novels by the unworked field to which they take us -- the
Canadian Northwest	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The Mistress of Bonaventure '' is the latest of these novels to come to our attention , although it would seem to be a reprint of an earlier work .

		Again we have pictured the hard life of the English settler in his struggle with cold winters and hot summers and crop failures and prairie fires and relentless usurers .

		In the present instance , the usurer is the chief source of the woes that come upon the hero , who is both stripped of his possessions and falsely accused of crime by his implacable enemy .

		The heroine is the daughter of a capitalist who owns the neighboring Bonaventure ranch , and , although reared in luxury , is the sort of young woman who can recognize genuine manhood beneath the roughest of exteriors .

		These being the conditions , the logi - cal outcome is evident enough .

		Disaster does not daunt our hei'o - farmer , and in the end his enemy makes a hasty escape over the border , while the coming of the railway brings assured prosperity to the man who had been so nearly down and out .

		It is a stirring story of real men and women , full of
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 45 incident , and fairly well written , although the style is now and then disfigured by a slovenly touch .

		A second exploiter of this same field is Mr.
Herman Whitaker	PERSON	, whose story of `` The Settler '' again tells the struggle of man with nature in a western Canadian province .

		The hero in this case is a very rough diamond indeed , and a variation of the usual framework of these stories is offered by the fact that he wins the heroine early in the narra - tive instead of at the close .

		Presently she becomes discontented with the hard conditions of her life , and a separation follows , which keeps the two apart for a long time .

		Meanwhile , the husband has a hard time of it , but stakes everything upon the construc - tion of a branch railway , which he finally succeeds in building despite the desperate opposition of the
Canadian Pacific	ORGANIZATION	.

		Then his own stubbornness and his wife 's pride relax sufiiciently to bring about a reunion .

		As compared with Mr.
Bindloss	PERSON	, the pres - ent novelist has a more animated manner and a greater flexibility of style , besides having a keener eye for dramatic effect .

		The heroine of `` The Crucible , '' by Mr.
Mark Lee Luther	PERSON	, is a child who in a fit of passion attacks her sister with the first convenient weapon , inflicting a slight wound .

		For this outburst of temper , her unnatural mother has the child taken to court and sentenced to a three years ' terra in the
State Refor	LOCATION	- matory .

		There we find her when the story opens , suUen and resentful , condemned to menial tasks , long - ing for the open fields from which the gray walls keep her .

		Yet the discipline imposed upon her is what she most needs , and the institution is the cruci - ble for the refining of her character .

		When freed , she becomes a shop-girl in
New York	LOCATION	, but her past comes up against her , and she is brought to desperate straits .

		Finally , the fairy prince appears , a young artist who had befriended her in her reformatory days , and whose memory she has ever since cher - ished .

		They are married , but she fails to tell him of a certain episode in her shop-girl days -- an inno - cent affair , but one that might seem suspicious -- and when that comes out , their happiness nearly suffers shipwreck .

		The story offers little more than a variation of a few well-worn themes , but the action moves rapidly from point to point , and the dramatic effects are skilfully contrived .

		The religious and aesthetic charlatan is pictured for us in '' Comrade
John	PERSON	, '' the latest joint effort of Messrs.
Merwin	PERSON	and
Webster	PERSON	.

		His name is
Herman Stein	PERSON	, and he derives , in about equal parts , from
Zion	ORGANIZATION	and East Am-ora .

		His colony has a home somewhere in the hUl country of
New York	LOCATION	, and its imposing array of staff and stucco architecture is enhanced by the natural beauty of lakes and cas - cades and mountains .

		All this is the work of Comrade
John	PERSON	, a creative genius who has hitherto been employed in the designing of amusement parks , and who is engaged by
Stein	PERSON	for the construction of
Beechcroft	LOCATION	, one of the conditions being that the designer shall pose as a disciple and conform to the customs of the colony .

		The acceptance of this con - dition makes Comrade
John	PERSON	out of the man who under his true name has a national reputation .

		Like most prophets of his stripe .


Stein	PERSON	has '' an eye for womankind , and he contrives to get a beautiful and credulous girl into his toils .

		She is to be a sort of high priestess of the new religion , and incidentally , when
Stein	PERSON	shall have divorced his present wife , she is to marry him .

		The story is mainly concerned with the rescue of this girl by the architect , who falls in love with her , opens her eyes to the whole miserable imposture , and exposes the prophet to his deluded followers .

		The story ends with a series of hurried escapes , the lovers fleeing in one direction , and the charlatan in another .

		It is a highly amus - ing tale , told with much spirit , and with a delectable fertility of humorous invention .

		Mr.
Harben	PERSON	's homely tales of life in
Georgia	LOCATION	are always pleasing in design , and his character-sketches bear the stamp of faithful observation .

		He knows his own people , negio and white , and they offer him a variety of types quite sufficient for his needs as a novelist .

		The negro figures quite prominently in `` Mam '
Linda	PERSON	, '' his latest novel , which is , in fact , essentially a presentation of one aspect of what we are apt to call the negro problem without having much idea of the exact nature of that problem .

		In this story a negro boy is wrongfully accused of crime , and the passions of his pursuers are so inflamed against him that his case seems desperate .

		But he has a friend in the hero , a young lawyer , who knows the boy to be innocent , and who risks his profes - sional and political career by his championship .

		It seems to him that the good name of the community and the very cause of Southern civilization are at stake in this affair , and his fine impersonal stand eventually wins for him the safety of the boy , the suffrage of his fellow-citizens , and the love of the heroine -- a reasonably adequate return for his efforts .

		The author by no means looks at the negro through rose-tinted glasses , but he understands him , which is more to the point , and his attitude is typical of the humane element in
Southern	LOCATION	society , called upon to grapple at first hand with a problem of which we , at this comfortable distance , can not realize either the complication or the menace .

		Mr.
Herbert Quick	PERSON	's `` Double Trouble , '' that ingenious tale of dual personality , leads us to open '' The Broken Lance '' with pleasant anticipa - tions .

		Nor are we disappointed , as far as plan and style are concerned , for the author knows how to write , and his eye for dramatic effect is keen .

		But we must confess to a considerable disappointment when we discover that the book is not so much a novel as an argument for the single tax .

		The leading char - acter is a clergyman so easily swayed by his emotions that a single reading of `` Progress and Poverty '' suffices to overturn his whole fabric of ideas over - night .

		With more zeal than discretion , he proceeds to expound the new gospel the next time he enters the pulpit -LRB- the greater part of the sermon is given us -RRB- , and horrifies his hearers by his plain language about what he conceives to be the tainted sources of 46 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, their wealth .

		From an apostle of sweet reasonable - ness he turns into a fiery fanatic , and the conse - quence ?

		, slowly unfolded , are that he becomes an outcast from the church , his wife divorces him , he is made the subject of an atrocious scandal , and becomes a noisy labor agitator , meeting his death in the riot that accompanies a teamsters ' strike in
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		The author 's earnestness compels a certain amount of sympathy even for so ill-balanced a hero as this , but he overdoes his denunciation of society , and can see nothing but greed and corruption where the clearer vision can clearly discern a preponderating element of integrity and philanthropical dealing .


Wllliam Morton Payne	PERSON	.

		Briefs on
Neiiv Books	ORGANIZATION	.

		The art of ^ ^ ' ^ - ^ -
Farrer	PERSON	's `` Literary For - uterary geries '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- is an account of for aery .

		some of the most celebrated impos - tures by which human credulity has been victimized .

		That is to say , it is a record of the detected impos - tures ; the reader has an uneasy feeling that the undetected might require a larger volume .

		If intelligent people in relatively critical periods could be all but completely deceived -- but why pursue so painful a reflection ?

		In the face of their victims ' credulity , one marvels at the moderation of these clever deceivers .

		The trutli seems to be that human - ity has been protected from worse deception not so much by its own discernment .

		as by the impostors ' failure to be quite clever enough .

		There is nearly always in their position a weak point that they over - look .

		That is , there is such a point in the position of those who are detected .

		One thing we may be quite clear about , namely , that hardly any degree of scholarship , fertility , and literary power , in a sus - pected work , is sufficient to warrant its authenticity .

		Nor is the absence of apparent motive for deception of any avail .

		The very ability to perform the trick seems to be motive enough .

		In other words , the art of literary forgery is an art like another , with its own inspirations , temerities , and rewards .

		And if an honest man like Scott could look upon the art without severe disapproval , we can hardly exact a higher moral standard of the artists themselves .

		But , as in the case of other indications of human frailty , it is probably well not to regard this with too severe a countenance .

		Certainly , it has its amusing side .

		The spectacle of
Boswell	ORGANIZATION	, flown with brandy and water , kneeling before the Shakespeare forgery of
Ireland	LOCATION	, reverently kissing `` the invaluable relics of our bard '' and thanking God that he has lived to see them , is not without humor ; but we confess that the thought of the great geometrician and astrono - mer ,
Chasles	PERSON	, accepting without a qualm letters written in the French language by
Plato	ORGANIZATION	,
Cleopatra	LOCATION	,
Lazarus	PERSON	, and
Mary Magdalene	PERSON	, strikes us as more painful than amusing .

		Mr.
Farrer	PERSON	deals with the Letters of Phalaris ^ nd
Trimalchio	ORGANIZATION	's
Supper	DATE	,
Simonides	PERSON	's Biblical and patristic forgeries , the amazing career of Psalmanazar , the
Eikon Basilik ^	ORGANIZATION	, the false Decretals and the Donation of Constantine , the
Rowley	PERSON	poems ,
Lauder	PERSON	's attack on
Milton	LOCATION	, the famous Shelley letters to which
Browning	PERSON	wrote an introduction , the shameful letters ascribed to
Marie Antoinette	PERSON	,
Ireland	LOCATION	's Vortigern and
Rowena	PERSON	and other Shakespearian frauds , various ballad forgeries , and the spurious novels of Scott .

		Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	, who contributes an introduction to the volume in his customary amusing vein , seems half regretful that he did not attempt to palm off a baUad of his own on Professor Child , to see if that great scholar and fine critic was proof against the guile of the forger .

		The early years Though
Lafcadio Heam	PERSON	's literary and struggles of reputation will not be enhanced by a literary artist , the publication of `` Letters from the Raven '' -LRB-
Brentano	ORGANIZATION	's -RRB- , these unstudied early writ - ings give an insight into phases of his personality not revealed by what he wrote for the world at large , nor , except in small measure , by the numerous private letters printed in his '' Life and Letters '' by Miss
Elizabeth Bisland	PERSON	.

		The fii * st ray of light that modi - fied the gloom of the period of bitter struggle after he was cast off by his relatives came when , at the age of nineteen , he made his way to
Cincinnati	LOCATION	.

		A chance acquaintance with a Scotch printer brought him an introduction to
Henry Watkin	PERSON	, an English - man of broad culture and liberal views , who gave
Hearn	ORGANIZATION	employment as an errand-boy in his printing - office , and afterward helped him secure a position on the staff of a
Cincinnati	LOCATION	newspaper .

		Between the two a warm friendship sprang up , which lasted as long as
Hearn	ORGANIZATION	lived .

		By
Watkin	PERSON	he was familiarly addressed as '' The Raven , '' and for many years a drawing of the bird served as the signature to what - ever
Hearn	PERSON	wrote to his '' Dear Old Dad , '' as he was wont to call him .

		The bull ^ of the correspondence is not great .

		It consists of various whimsical and amusing messages , and about two dozen letters , most of them written during
Hearn	PERSON	's sojourn in
New Orleans	LOCATION	.

		They abound in half-playful , half-serious mention of privations and pleasures , occupations and aspirations , and are supplemented by the sympathetic running comment of the editor , Mr.
Milton Bronner	PERSON	, who has fused them into a connected outline of
Hearn	ORGANIZATION	's career .

		Appended are a number of letters to an anonymous lady correspondent , and extracts from letters contributed to a
Cincinnati	LOCATION	newspaper under the pseudonym of ''
Ozias Midwinter	PERSON	. ''

		The interest that attaches to these utterances is in a way pathetic .

		Unfeeling indeed would be the person who could read them and not be touched by the brave effort to build up within , while combating adverse circumstances without .

		Two things they serve to show .

		One is an exemplification of the old lesson that with rare exceptions patient preparation is the necessary prelude to noteworthy performance .

		The other is that with his temperament and physical dis - abilities it is most unlikely that under any other con - ditions
Hearn	ORGANIZATION	would have achieved more than he
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 47 actually accomplished .

		His real life was never in the sordid present .

		From early youth until the day of his death , the glamour of the unseen was always luring him onward .

		Possibly this meant for him a loss in things material , but the spiritual gain is gi-eat .

		A teiegrapher ^ s - ^ * t `` ^ ^ ^ ^ many books , pamphlets , recollections of and magazine articles written about the Civil War .

		Lincoln , one might think that little if anything remained to be told .

		Yet '' Lincoln in the Telegraph Office '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
David Homer Bates	PERSON	, gives a new view of the great War President .

		Mr.
Bates	PERSON	was a telegraph operator in the War Department , and saw much of
Lincoln	LOCATION	, who frequently visited the military telegraph office in order to get the latest news from the armies .

		The volume under review is made up of articles recently published in the
Century Magazine	ORGANIZATION	, to which some padding has been added .

		Much of the book is devoted to what the author saw and heard , and much of it to descriptions of and comments upon affairs that the author knew no more about than the ordinary citizen .

		The latter part is of little value and often unreliable ; but the former is distinctly good .

		The scope of the work is broader than the title would indicate .

		It is really a sort of history of the military telegraph service at the War Department , but it is arranged around
Lincoln	LOCATION	as a central figure .

		The best of the book describes the organization of the military telegraph corps and the service of the corps in and near
Washington	LOCATION	; and through it all runs the binding thread of narrative about Lincoln .

		It is a genuinely fresh treatment of a little-known phase of
Lincoln	LOCATION	's everyday life -- when he was away from the importunities of politi - cians and places-hunters , and , being less harrassed , was freer in manner .

		The account is studded with anecdotes , new and old , but all well told ; and here and there are new lights upon historical matters , such , for example , as the statement -LRB- page 108 -RRB- about the suppressed messages and parts of mes - sages to and from
McClellan	PERSON	.

		The sketch of Mr.
Andrew Carnegie	PERSON	's war-time activities is worth reading , and the explanation of cipher codes and their uses by both
Northern and Southern	ORGANIZATION	author - ities is alone of sufficient interest to justify the publication of the book .

		The illustrations are good .


Stanton	PERSON	, great and rude , is frequently exhibited in a pleasant situation -- as in this passage : '' He invited me to a seat on the greensward , while he read the telegrams ; and then , business being finished , we began talking of early times in
Steuben	LOCATION	- ville ,
Ohio	LOCATION	, his native town and mine .

		One of us mentioned the game of mumble-the-peg , and he asked me if I could play it .

		Of course I said yes , and he proposed that we should have a game then and there .


Stanton	PERSON	entered into the spirit of the boyish sport with great zest , and for the moment all the perplexing questions of the terrible war were forgotten . ''

		It is rather unfortunate that Mr.
Bates	PERSON	undertakes to deal with matters not related to his subject .

		About a third of the book is padding , inter - esting but not always authentic .

		The sympathies of the author do not include many of those who were on the other side .

		On pages 86 and 87 , pages 28 and 29 are repeated -- a slip not to be expected in a work from the De Vinne Press . ''

		There will be no peace in literary scholar of repute persists in employ - ing any variation in the name of our greatest poet . ''

		So , at least , says Dr.
J. L. Haney	PERSON	in the preface to his little treatise , '' The Name of
William Shakespeare	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Philadelphia	LOCATION	: The
Egerton Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		As the title indicates .

		Dr.
Haney	PERSON	is an advocate of the form almost universally adopted by the publishers of the quartos and folios .

		He belongs , therefore , not to the ranks of '' manuscript-men , '' in Dr.
Furnivall	PERSON	's phrase , but to the `` second-banders -- charming fellows , some of them , but too fond of type . ''

		As is well known .

		Dr.
Furnivall	PERSON	is a staunch upholder of the so-called
Stratford	LOCATION	spelling ,
Shakspere	LOCATION	, based upon the five signatures of the poet ; though he him - self concedes that of these only one is certainly Shakspere .

		As for the
Stratford	LOCATION	origin of this form , there is the same variation in the local records as there apparently is in the signatures .

		At this point it may not be amiss to remark that three of Dr.
Haney	PERSON	's transcriptions of the
Stratford	LOCATION	records differ from those of Halliwell-Phillipps and
Lambert	PERSON	-LRB-
Shakespeare Documents	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		This is only one indi - cation of the great difficulty of an inquiry the results of which may be nullified at any moment by a slight error of eye or hand .

		Dr.
Haney	PERSON	takes into account , besides the
Stratford Registers	ORGANIZATION	and the title-pages of early editions , contemporary documents and allu - sions , the
Stationers	ORGANIZATION	' Registers , and the usage of modern critics and editors .

		His summary of the '' evidence '' is as follows : '' We find that the name occurred originally in numerous variant forms ; that at
Stratford	LOCATION	the spelling Shakspere prevailed for a time , though rarely after the beginning of the dramatist 's career ; that the
Stationers	ORGANIZATION	' Registers and other contemporary documents present a wilderness of confusing variations ; that although four of the five autographs seem intended to spell Shakspere , the title-pages of the quartos and of the
First Folio	ORGANIZATION	point more strongly to the form

		If the usage of later scholars and critics is of less weight , it is at least noteworthy that the recent editors and biographers who have specialized most zealously upon the study of the poet are virtually unanimous for the longer spelling . ''

		A
Yankee Professor	ORGANIZATION	in
France	LOCATION	.

		To the average American tourist , all Gaul consists of
Paris	LOCATION	, and
Paris	LOCATION	of
Notre Dame	LOCATION	, the
Louvre	LOCATION	, and the
Moulin Rouge	ORGANIZATION	.

		That there is any home-life more sacred than that portrayed in the yellow-covered French novels , this easy-going individual does not concern himself to suspect ; stiU less does he know of the universities and the school system bound up 48 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, with them , while the religion of
France	LOCATION	he is satis - fied to divide into Roman Catholicism and atheism .

		But the author of ''
France	LOCATION	of Today '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is not a mere tourist , for as the incumbent of the
Hyde	PERSON	lectureship he was taken at once into that intimate association which enabled him to see French life hidden from the transitory dweller in hotels .

		Natm-ally , Professor
Wendell	PERSON	's primary interest is in the universities and the school system , and of these he gives an exposition which brings out the essential differences of the French scheme of education from the American .

		Of French society and the French family he writes much as a highly-favored guest might discuss the family of his host .

		Everything is so pleasantly said that one is tempted to make allowances on the score of courtesy .

		Still , it is all very interesting , and in the face of much that is said and more that is thought to the contrary it is refreshing to see the golden side of the shield .

		This leads naturally to the question '' why the life of modern
France	LOCATION	, when you come to know it , seems so different from the same life as set forth in the most highly developed literature of modern
Europe	LOCATION	. ''

		Notwithstanding the convention that surrounds the French woman , the intellectual candor of the French people which permits them to discuss topics forbid - den among ourselves , and the fact that literature must concern itself with interesting exceptions to the commonplace -- such being Professor
Wendell	PERSON	's answers to his question , -- one is yet forced to the conclusion that back of this literature is a life which the favored guest would not see among the respec - table families of his cultured hosts .

		Literature can
spring	DATE	only from life , and French literature is too vital to reflect only rare though remarkable exceptions .

		Memorials of ^ ^ ^ '' ^ ^ ^ ™ `` ^ e was
Thomas Davidson	PERSON	a wandering the man and teacher than
Thomas	PERSON	scholar .

		Davidson the writer , that a book about him is likely to impart far more of his peculiar quality than a book by him .

		Most welcome , there - fore , is the volume of '' Memorials of
Thomas Davidson	PERSON	, the Wandering Scholar '' -LRB-
Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , collected and edited by his fellow-countryman .

		Professor
William Knight	PERSON	, who four years ago printed a short account of him in '' Some Nineteenth - Century Scotsmen . ''

		Born in 1 840 and dying in
1900	DATE	,
Davidson	PERSON	crowded into his too-short life an amount of learning , lecturing , restless roaming , teaching and writing that is , all told , nothing short of stupendous .

		By one who knew him well he was counted `` as within the circle of the twelve most learned men in the world , '' yet he carried his load of erudition so lightly and was so little stationary in his mode of life , and so invariably at leisure to welcome friends or acquaintances or even strangers seeking his counsel , that comparatively few thought of or even suspected those stores of knowledge which he never seemed to sit stUl long enough to amass , much less to digest .

		Extraordinary intellectual alertness and a wonderful memory must explain the mystery .

		At home in all languages whose literatures had any - thing to offer him , he once puzzled a Frenchman , a German , and an Italian , by engaging all three in a discussion and responding to each in his own tongue with so faultless an accent that each claimed him as a feUow-countryman .

		This many-sidedness may account for some of the varying and even contradic - tory impressions that he seems to have made on different friends .

		In Professor Knight 's volume one friend calls him '' a Platonizer , '' another '' a devout Aristotelian , '' one describes him as holding
Kant	PERSON	in small esteem , and another declares that '' he always spoke with reverence of
Kant	PERSON	. ''

		These recollections of friends and disciples , with extracts from his letters and other writings , combine to portray , roughly and l > y suggestion , an inspiring and astonishingly versa - tile character ; but a complete and consistent account of the man , if such be possible , is yet to be written .

		In '' The True Story of My Life '' irZX * .

		life .

		-LRB-
John Lane	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mrs.
Alice Mangold Diehl	PERSON	, we have one of those discursive autobiographies of non-famous persons which chron - icle an immense amount of unimportant private history and must rely chiefly on their realism for their charm .

		And yet the author probably deserves to be better known in
America	LOCATION	for her useful and industrious career in music and literature .

		A pianist of considerable repute in
London	LOCATION	during the sixties and seventies , she later became a prolific novelist and poured forth a flood of fiction which generally found friendly publishers and a host of readers .

		As a precocious child , she was taken to
Germany	LOCATION	and became a pupU of Adolf Henselt , whose genius and eccentricities she describes in an interesting way .

		After a successful debut in
Paris	LOCATION	at the age of seventeen , she returned to her native
England	LOCATION	; and the narrative from this point is simply the detailed record of a brave and unflagging struggle to care for her growing family .

		There are apparently no reserves in the story : her mother 's imperiousness , her husband 's foibles , her own failures and triumphs in fighting off the '' wolf , '' are recorded with such fidelity that we seem to be turning the pages of a diary .

		Naturally , a long and semi-public life in and near
London	LOCATION	brought Mrs.
Diehl	PERSON	more or less in contact with the great ones of literature and art ; and her pages show us interesting glimpses of Sir
Henry Irving	PERSON	,
Lord Leighton	PERSON	,
Antoinette Sterling	PERSON	, the baritone
Santley	PERSON	, and other celebrities of the time .

Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Constitution .

		Mr.
E. Parmalee Prentice	PERSON	combats what he calls '' a most dangerous and mistaken notion '' -- that new meanings must be given to the Constitution merely because present questions are beyond the contemplation of the statesmen of a cen - tury ago .

		The work is historical and legal in its method , and shows much patient research among early statutes and a carefully critical reading of many cases ; but while the method and the temper - ate language employed give the impression of a calm
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 49 and judicious mind , the effect is marred by frequent unmistakable evidences of bias .

		Indeed , the main purpose of the book would seem to be to oppose as unconstitutional the proposal of Mr.
Garfield	PERSON	, in his first report as Commissioner of Corporations , that companies engaging in interstate commerce should be licensed by the
Federal Government	ORGANIZATION	; for the author regards Federal license as a violation of the freedom of trade among the
States	LOCATION	.

		The careful student who realizes how easily opposite conclusions can be drawn from the same decision of
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	will make note of Mr.
Prentice	PERSON	's citations and read at least some of the epoch-making decisions for himself .

		To such a student the volume will prove a very convenient introduction to the subject .

		, , , , Mr.
Owen Edwards	PERSON	, of
Lincoln Col	ORGANIZATION	- A book for z-wpii i jjj bepinners in lege ,
Oxford	LOCATION	, has recently added Welsh history , another volume to his Celtic studies in the form of '' A Short History of Wales '' -LRB-
University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The book is written for '' those who have never read any Welsh history before , '' and for such readers it no doubt has its value .

		In so brief a work , a connected narrative of course becomes impossible ; only the most prominent events and episodes can be treated or even men - tioned .

		The author 's point of view is that of a Welshman who believes in the perpetuation of Celtic nationality in custom , speech , and literatm-e , but not in
Welsh	LOCATION	political independence beyond a certain measure of administrative autonomy .

		The story is told in a simple , straightforward , but interesting fashion , which would make it easier reading were it not for the author 's puristic ideas in the matter of proper names .

		It ought to be possible to anglicize
Welsh	ORGANIZATION	names and terms to a slight extent -- at least to write them with such vowels and consonants as produce a pronounceable combination in English ; to the reader who has never read Welsh history before , combinations like
Clwyd	PERSON	,
Gwledig	PERSON	, and
Cynddelw	PERSON	are not very intelligible .

		Notes .

		We have not had a new '' Temple Primer '' for some time .

		An addition to the series is now made in the shape of a little book on '' Sick Nursing , '' by Mr.
H. Drinkwater	PERSON	.

		Among the enterprises comprised imder the general title of '' The Shakespeare Library '' -LRB-
Duffield	PERSON	-RRB- is an edition of the plays in the spelling of the best quarto and folio texts .

		The first play to be published in this '' Old - Spelling Shakespeare '' is '' Loues Labors Lost , '' edited by Dr.
F. J. Fumivall	PERSON	.

		An event of interest to book lovers and collectors is the sale , at auction , of some eight hundred old English books , including scarce and valuable works on
Ireland	LOCATION	, on early printing , etc. .

		Catalogues may be had by addressing the
Williams , Barker & Severn Co.	ORGANIZATION	, 187 Wabash avenue ,
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		A small volume of Character Portraits from
Dickens	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
Charles Welsh	PERSON	, gives us brief summaries , with references for further information , of about one hmidred and fifty of the characters that have their being in the world of the novelist 's creation .

		It is published by
Messrs. Small	ORGANIZATION	,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		A series of books entitled '' On American Holidays '' has been planned by Messrs.
Moffat	PERSON	,
Yard , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and the first volume , '' Christmas , '' edited by Mr.
Robert Haven Sehauffler	PERSON	, is now ready .

		It is essentially a book of selections , in verse and prose , relating to the origin , celebration , and significance of the day .

		The important monograph on '' The Inheritance Tax , '' by Mr.
Max West	PERSON	, much revised and enlarged from its original form , is issued from the
Columbia University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		This form of taxation is very much `` in the air '' just at present , and it is well to know what other countries have done with it .

		Mr.
West	PERSON	's discussion is both historical and theoretical , and is a very thorough piece of work .

		From the
Cambridge University Press	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- comes an edition of '' The Poems of WilUam
Dunbar	PERSON	, '' edited , with the necessary apparatus -LRB- considerable m this case -RRB- , by Mr.
H. Belly se Baildon	PERSON	.

		This is a pub - lication that scholars will welcome , since the earlier editions '' are now all difficult and costly to procure , '' while this one is compact and inexpensive , besides em - bodying the best modern scholarship .

		A new edition of
George Palmer Putnam	PERSON	's ''
Tabular Views of Universal History	ORGANIZATION	, '' continued to date by Messrs.
Lynde E. Jones	PERSON	and
Simeon Strunsky	PERSON	, is pub - lished by Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		Thi ^ chrono - logical conspectus of the world 's history , with its useful arrangement in parallel columns , is of great value to both teachers and students , and in its present modernized form , should find its career of helpfidness considerably prolonged . ''

		The Modern Reader 's Bible , '' as now published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	for Professor
R. G. Moulton	PERSON	, repre - sents what may be taken as a fairly definitive form of a work that has had various earlier appearances , and to which the editor has devoted a large part of his life .

		The text is that of the Revised Version , with modifica - tions .

		Printed upon thin paper , the volume contains nearly eighteen hundred pages , and is not unwieldy at that .

		Sir
George Trevelyan	PERSON	, browsing among the books of
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	, has foimd so much entertainment in the mar - ginal notes with which they are plentifully provided that he has thought it worth while to take the public into his confidence .

		The result is a little book entitled '' Mar - ginal Notes by Lord Macaulay , '' which affords delightful reading of the chatty sort , and leaves us with the wish that there were much more of it .

		Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the pubhshers .

		Three new volumes are added by the
Oliver Ditson Co.	ORGANIZATION	to their '' Musicians ' Library . ''

		One of them is the first volume of a '' Bach Piano Album , '' edited by Mr.
Ebenezer Prout	PERSON	.

		It includes shorter compositions only -- preludes , dances , inventions , symphonies , and suites -- to the number of about fifty .

		Another of the volumes is devoted to
Haydn	ORGANIZATION	, and contains twenty compositions for piano , eleven of them being sonatas .

		It is edited by Mr.
Xaver Scharwenka	PERSON	.

		The third volume , edited by Mr.
Carl Armbruster	PERSON	, gives us ''
Wagner	PERSON	Lyrics for Baritone and Bass . ''

		All the music-dramas are rep - resented , excepting ''
Rienzi	PERSON	, '' and we have in addition two early ballads , '' Der Tannenbaum '' and '' Die
Beiden Grenadiere	PERSON	. ''

Stedman	PERSON	, -- '' They are all gone into the world of light ! ''

		The last leaf has fallen from the tree , and the first great age of American poetry is rounded out to its close .

		Other poets we shall have , with other themes to inspire them , but the spiritual expression of our nineteenth century , with its portentous blossoming of democracy and its central tragedy of sectional hatred culminating in civil war , is now complete ; the last of the poets who knew at first-hand the tremendous happenings of haK a century ago , and whose song was potent in the cause of righteousness , has been laid to rest .

		And whatever successors ' they may have will find it no easy task to earn the laurels of such a fame or the tribute of such an affection as have been gratefully bestowed upon the poets of the group now unrepresented by a single survivor .


Edmund Clarence Stedman	PERSON	was born in
1833	DATE	, in
Hartford	LOCATION	,
Connecticut	LOCATION	, and when he died , on the eighteenth of
last month	DATE	, was in his seventy - fifth year .

		He was the son of
Edmmid Burke Stedman	PERSON	and
Elizabeth Dodge	ORGANIZATION	.

		He lost his father when still a child , and his mother , a woman of marked poetical ability , afterwards married
William B. Kinney	PERSON	, and went to
Italy	LOCATION	to live .

		The boy was placed in charge of an uncle in
Norwich	LOCATION	, where he lived from the age of five to sixteen , and where he was fitted for college .

		This is the town which he afterwards celebrated in verse as '' The
Liland City	LOCATION	. '' ''

		Guarded by cii-cling streams and wooded luomitains , Like sentinels round a queen , Dotted with groves and musical with fountains , Tlie city lies serene . ''

		He entered
Yale	ORGANIZATION	in
1849	DATE	, as a member of the Class of
1853	DATE	, but did not complete the course .

		Many years afterward , the
University	ORGANIZATION	made up for the degree then withheld , and bestowed upon him her highest academic distinctions .

		The twenty-fifth anniversary of his class evoked from him the poem '' Meridian , '' in which his
Alma Mater	PERSON	is made to ask : '' Now who have kept my maxims best ?

		Who have most nearly held within theii ' gi-asp The fluttering robe that each essayed to clasp ? ''

		62 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, Probably no truer answer to the question has been made than that written in the record of his own life .

		Returning to
Norwich	LOCATION	at the age of nineteen , he became the editor of a local newspaper , and country journalism claimed him for the next four years .

		Then he sought a wider field in
New York City	LOCATION	, which was to be his home for the remainder of his life .

		He joined the staff of '' The Tribune , '' and wrote much for the maga - zines .

		He became intimately associated with
Taylor	PERSON	,
Stoddard	PERSON	,
Curtis	PERSON	,
Winter	DATE	,
Aldrich	PERSON	, and
Howells	PERSON	.

		It was for '' The Tribune '' that he wrote the poems that soon made his name widely known -- `` The Diamond Wedding , '' `` The Ballad of Lager Bier , '' and '' How Old Brown Took
Harper	PERSON	's Ferry . ''

		The outbreak of the Civil War sent him to
Washington	LOCATION	and the front , where he served for two years as special correspondent of '' The World . ''

		Then followed a period of law study , during which he acted as private secretary to Attorney-General
Bates	PERSON	.

		In
1864	DATE	he became connected with the work of
the Union Pacific Railroad	ORGANIZATION	, which diverted his thoughts from law to finance .

		This proved to be the turning-point of his life , for it brought him back to
New York	LOCATION	, and started him on his career as a man of affairs .

		Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	went into the brokerage and banking business , and in
1869	DATE	became a mem - ber of the
New York Stock Exchange	ORGANIZATION	, a fact which determined his practical activities for over thirty years .

		This step was taken with his eyes wide open , and with the determination that , shoidd he become a successful broker , he would be none the less a poet -- that his business should be with him no more than a means to an ideal end .

		In consequence , he became known as the '' banker-poet , '' an appellation which he partic - idarly resented , because he felt that if a man deserved the title of poet at all it should be given him without qualification .

		There is little , in - deed , in his poems to indicate that he was a shrewd man of affairs , or anything but a devotee of the muse . ''

		Pan in Wall Street '' and ''
Israel Freyer	PERSON	's Bid for Gold '' suggest his days in the mart , but they are only the exceptions that prove the rule .

		As a man of business he prospered exceedingly for a term of years , and then suf - fered reverses which profoundly affected the remainder of his career .

		Although he recov - ered , in a measure , from the crisis that had nearly swept away his fortune , and survived it by a quarter-century , his later life was some - thing of a struggle , and his closing years were clouded by long seasons of illness and darkened by the death of his wife , the gTacious hostess of Casa Laura -- his country home in
Lawrence Park	LOCATION	.

		His life as a whole , aside from its literary aspect , was singularly active and varied .

		If we test him by
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's couplet , -- '' Es bildet eiii Taleut sich in der Stille , Sich ein Charakter in dem Strom der Welt , '' -- it is clear that he was plunged in the currents of many worldly affairs , and that they shaped him into a character of distinctive strength .

		He was active in so many intellectual , artistic , political , and social concerns , that their enumer - ation would require a considerable paragraph .

		Of them all , we will mention only his effective work done with the
American Copyright League	ORGANIZATION	, of which he became the president after
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	's death .

		But it is particularly curious to note that what Goethe meant for an antithesis , a contrast of irreconcileables , became in Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	's case a synthesis , ' for precisely the sort of talent that is the outgrowth of the secluded and reflective life , was also his , and he produced much delicate literature that might be judged , from its internal evidence , to be the work of the veriest dreamer .

		Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	's work as a man of letters was of three distinct kmds -- editorial , critical , and poetical .

		As an editor of the writings of others , his work waS done with remarkable learning and discretion , and exhibited just those qualities of judgment and good taste that were to be expected from a poet and critic of his high rank .

		His monuments in this department are the edition of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- in conjunction with Professor
Woodberry	PERSON	-RRB- , the '' Library of American Literature '' -LRB- with the collaboration of Miss
Hutchinson	PERSON	-RRB- , and the two Anthologies , '' Victorian '' and '' American . ''

		In each of these cases , the work was so sym - pathetically and thoroughly done that better performances were with difficulty imaginable .

		Time will call for an extension of the Library and the Anthologies , but it will hardly bring an improvement upon the treatment of the mat - ter within their scope .

		The main body of Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	's critical writing is comprised within three volumes .

		The '' Victorian Poets '' -LRB- 1875 -RRB- contains essays that had been slowly built up into their permanent form during a number of years preceding their collective publication .

		When the volume ap - peared it was at once recognized , in both
America	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	, as a masterly produc - tion , as the most important systematic work of literary criticism that
America	LOCATION	had produced .

		Ten years later appeared the companion volimie
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 63 on '' Poets of
America	LOCATION	, '' an even richer and riper work .

		When the TurnbuU lectureship on poetry was founded , in
1891	DATE	, at the
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	, the author of these two volumes was the inevitable choice for the inaug - ural series of discourses , and Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	, putting aside all other work , shut himself up for months in the library of The Players , and prepared his last great work of critical apprecia - tion , the work which was afterwards published as '' The Nature and Elements of Poetry . ''

		These three books made clear his title as the foremost of our critics .

		Lowell alone might have been held a possible competitor for that distinction , but
Lowell	LOCATION	, with all his brilliancy and wit and fine feeling , was lacking in the comprehensive view and the philosophical grasp that characterize
Stedman	PERSON	's critical writing .

		It is not too much to say that the three volumes now in question constitute
America	LOCATION	's most solid and lasting contribution to the literature of criticism .

		As a poet , of course , Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	was but one among many of high rank ; we may not even call him primus inter pares ; but the fact that his place is a little below that of three or four writers of the
New England	LOCATION	group shoidd not lessen the warmth of our tribute of gratitude for the precious gift of his song .

		In the days of our war-agony he voiced the national feeling in unforgettable strains , and for a full generation afterward continued to produce work which was always worthy and often memorable for beauty and artistic distinction .

		His lyrical faculty was remarkable , he had the trick of effective bal - ladry , and he was almost unsurpassed as a writer of occasional and coromemorative verse .

		His long poems -- ''
Alice	PERSON	of Monmouth '' and '' The I Blameless Prince '' -- did not become widely popular , but they are still well deserving of attention and respect .

		His reputation also suffered in some degree from the fact that a number of poets from ten to thirty years his senior were already firmly fixed in the national affection , and our public did not keenly feel the need of more .

		Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	's personality was so engaging , and was the outward expression of a character of such fineness of fibre , that he bound men to himself by ties of more than common affection .

		His charm , his sincerity , and his generous sym - pathies made themselves felt by young and old alike , radiating upon all who came within the reach of their influence .

		Whether as the cen - tral figure of a great public gathering , or as one of a group in some club corner , or as the com - panion with whom a single intimate held high converse concerning the things of the mind , he always entered genially into the spirit of the situation , and the occasional touch of sharpness in his manner which gave salt to the discourse was merely the index of an intelligence so alert , so quick in its response to stimidus , that it was impatient of all the transparent devices whereby men of slower wit played for time to collect their thoughts .

		To use a physical metaphor , his own electric potential was so high that he induced currents of unwonted intensity in the minds that came within the reach of his own .

		And this keen eager interest in all that pei * - tained to art and letters and life was unimpaired by the shocks of fate -- more severe in his case than most men have to bear -- and remained as characteristic of his broken closing years as it had been of his prime .

		The last thing that could have been said of him was that he lagged super - fluous on the stage , or that he had outlived his day .

		Fifteen years ago , Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	wrote a sonnet with these opening lines : '' Give me to die unwitting of the day , And stricken in Life 's brave heat , with senses clear : Not swathed and couched until the lines appear Of Death 's wan mask upon this withering clay . ''

		The '' Mors Benefica '' for whose touch he thus prayed came to him the other day , and his wish was fulfilled .

		A sudden failure of the heart , and all was over . ''

		Dead he lay among his books , '' and the word went forth that our foremost man of letters , the last of our earlier poets , was no more .

		Some hint of what that message meant was to be seen in the distinguished company that gathered in the
Church of the Messiah three days later	DATE	, to share in the impressive services which paid the last of earthly honors to the beloved dead .

		HOLGEB
DBA	ORGANIZATION	CHMANN , For the past score of years , the two greatest men of letters in
Denmark	LOCATION	have been the critic Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	, and the poet and novelist
Holger Drachmann	PERSON	.

		Now
Drachmann	PERSON	is dead , in his sixty - second year , and the event means almost as much for Danish letters as the death of
Ibsen	PERSON	did for Norwegian letters year before last .

		His powerful individuality expressed itself in great numbers of lyrics and ballads , in plays , in formal works of fiction , and in a sort of rhapsodical prose not easily classifiable .

		To describe him as a blend of Byron with
Walt Whitman	PERSON	would not be far from the truth .

		He had
Byron	PERSON	's restive nature , his passion for the 64 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, sea , and his tendency to regard all conventional morality as hypocrisy and to revolt against it .

		On the other hand , he had much of Whitman 's radi - calism and democracy , and of his disregard for lit - erary form .

		Drachmann began life as a painter , and the sea was the favorite subject of his brush as afterwards of his pen .

		In
1870	DATE	he settled in
London	LOCATION	for a time , painting and writing , lived with workingmen and nursed his scorn of priests and aristocrats and the middle-class view of life .

		His delight in this period was to 6pater le bourgeois , and respectable
Denmark	LOCATION	looked askance at his writings .

		His first book of poems appeared in
1872	DATE	, and marked the formal entrance into literature of one of the most prolific of modern Danish authors .

		In middle life he made terms -LRB- of a sort -RRB- with society , and accepted honors -LRB- which he still half - despised -RRB- from the classes whose sentiments he had outraged .

		But he covild not remain long in the harness , and his later years found him again a wanderer in many lands , his sympathies always with the humble and the downtrodden , although he did not wholly forego his friendly relations with the mighty .

		In the late nineties he spent two years or more in the
United States	LOCATION	; and it was in an evening of the
spring of 1900	DATE	, when he was dining In
Chicago	LOCATION	with the writer of these lines , that he received the message from King Oscar asking him to come at once to Stock - holm , that ended his American sojourn .

		Among his works we may mention , besides the many collections of verse , his translation of Byron 's ''
Don Juan	PERSON	'' into Danish , his `` Beyond the Border , '' his highly successful play `` Once upon a Time , '' his `` Pledged , '' a long and serious work of fiction , and his '' Sacred Fire , '' a book belonging to no particular class , written during his stay in this country .

		The only one of his books that has , to our knowledge , been translated into English is the idyllic tale called ''
Paul	PERSON	and
Virginia	LOCATION	of a Northern Zone , '' a slight but exquisite performance .

		In one of his most suc - cessful lyrics this outcry occurs : '' Oh !

		had I command of a viking ship , With a hundred fighters on board ! ''

		It is a typical expression of his masterful personality , and those who knew by sight that giant frame sur - mounted by that magnificent head needed no more to imagine his wish fulfilled , and to picture him as the hero of some successful raid upon the coast of
Normandy	LOCATION	, or the
Piraeus	LOCATION	, or the stronghold of Micklegarth itself .

		Two important publications of the
Hakluyt Society	ORGANIZATION	are at hand .

		One of them contains translations , by Sir
Clements Markham	PERSON	, of
Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa	PERSON	's '' History of the Incas '' and
Baltasar de Ocampo	PERSON	's `` The Execution of the luca Tupac Amaru . ''

		The other , from the same translator , includes two nai-ratives of the Friar Alonso de Espiuosa : '' The Guanches of Teuerife '' and '' The Holy Image of Our Lady of
Candelaria	LOCATION	. ''

		Mr.
Bernard Quaritch	PERSON	,
London	LOCATION	, is the agent for the publica - tions of the Society .

		PATRIOTISM AND THE PUBLIC LIBRARY .

		The late King Oscar of
Sweden	LOCATION	gave his sanction and support to the establishment of Swedish circulat - ing libraries in those parts of the
United States	LOCATION	most largely settled by emigrants from his own kingdom .

		This was done in the hope of keeping warm in the exile 's heart the love of the mother country , her language and literature , and of thus inducing him to return some day to the land of his birth .

		These Swedish libraries are said to have been in successful operation in the middle West for a year past ; and lately a consignment of books has been received at
Worcester	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, the Swedish centre of New En - gland .

		Each Swedish church there is to have its share of these books , which will be replaced by fresh sendings from
Sweden	LOCATION	as often as desired .

		This plan , excellent from a Scandinavian point of view , may at first strike one as of doubtful merit when looked at from this side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		That the alien colonist of cultiu `` e and means , and possessed of the valuable assets of character and success which these intellectual and material acquisitions stand for , should be encouraged to withdraw his abilities and his resources from the scene where they have been chiefly developed or acquired , seems a little unfair .

		Having once renounced his allegiance to a land imable to satisfy his growing ambitions and desires , should he not remain true to the adoptive mother whose bounty he has been so willing to enjoy ?

		Undoubtedly the spectacle of a returning emigrant , his pockets filled with American gold , hastening back to the old country to enjoy his wealth amid the scenes of his youth , is to us not the most pleasing that could be imagined .

		The throwing away of a sucked orange is never a graceful gesture ; and no country enjoys bemg treated like a sucked orange .

		But it is a question whether the effect desired by
King Oscar	ORGANIZATION	will follow as a result of his generous act .

		At any rate , it will be interesting to note , if possible , whether these Swedish libraries really do promote a return of literature-loving Swedish settlers to the native land .

		Hitherto it has been the re - patriation of the less cultured and less desirable foreigners that has attracted attention .

		The Chinese laundryman 's eagerness to get back to his feUow - celestials with a few hundred dollars earned in the sweat of his brow over the hot flatiron , is notorious .

		The Italian ditch-digger 's or organ-grinder 's dream of ending his days in the sunny land of abundant macaroni and cheap sour wine -- a dream , too , that is not seldom realized -- is equally well known .

		That the impulse to re-knit the severed home ties increases in strength with the intelligence and culture of the emigrant , has yet to be proved .

		More likely is it that superior mental endowments and acquirements , such as are not uncommonly indicated by the reading habit , beget increased appreciation of the larger opportunity and the greater freedom of American life , and a disinclination to resume the narrower existence that has been left behind .


1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 65 Whatever the truth of the matter , it would be interesting to have the opinion of public library officers in our cosmopolitan or foreign-settled cities and villages as to whether the providing of foreign literature for the aliens in our midst tends to make them good and contented citizens of their adoptive country , or the reverse .

		One likes to believe that a broad and generous policy in this regard will prove the wisest for all concerned . ''

		Give to the world the best you have , and the best will come back to you , '' is a noble sentiment , and we should be sorry to see it prove false in our treatment of the homesick foreigner visiting our public libraries in quest of a book endeared by early associations .

		As a matter of fact , what could more greatly aid in tiding the unhappy alien over his period of acute nostalgia than a readily-accessible bookcase of his favorite authors , supposing him of sufficient intelli - gence to have such favorites ?


Boston	LOCATION	, a city of very mixed population , provides for its public-library users a generous assortment of books in many for - eign languages , and separate catalogues of these collections are printed and all but gratuitously dis - tributed .

		The list of Russian books , for example , is a pamphlet containing about six hundred titles ; and the accessions since it was printed , twelve years ago , would swell the number considerably .

		Russian literature , too , is in far less demand than the literatures of several other foreign countries , which are more abundantly represented .

		Yet with aU this kindly consideration for the reading wants of her immigrant population ,
Boston	LOCATION	is not heard to complain of an exodus of her more de - sirable foreign-born citizens ; and her experience is probably that of many other large cities similarly situated .

		The relation of race and language to international sympathies and antipathies is of course too vast and too difficult a subject for treatment here .

		Historical inquiry and philological research have played their part in producing effects not merely scientific and literary , but political and practical .

		As
Freeman	PERSON	once observed , '' the world is not the same world as when men had not dreamed of the kindred between Sanscrit ,
Greek	LOCATION	, and English , when it was looked on as something of a paradox to hint that there was a distinction between Celtic and Teutonic tongues and nations . ''

		The change that , by various agencies , has been wrought in a comparatively short time , is again noted by the same historian when he says that '' a hundred years ago a man 's political likes and dislikes seldom went beyond the range which was suggested by the place of his bu-th or immediate descent .

		Such birth or descent made him a mem - ber of this or that political community , a subject of this or that prince , a citizen -- perhaps a subject -- of this or that commonwealth .

		The political com - munity of which he was a member had its tradi - tional alliances and traditional enmities , and by those alliances and enmities the likes and dislikes of the members of that community were guided .

		But those traditional alliances and enmities were seldom determined by theories about language or race . ''

		And he goes on with further interesting but for us not exactly pertinent reflections .

		In the mere matter of language-growth and of rich - ness of vocabulary , the presence among us of many tliat speak other tongues than ours is of advantage to our own .

		The unwisdom of legislation designed to discourage the use of a foreign idiom is too obvious to need enlarging upon , its futility too abundantly proved in the past to remain longer in doubt .

		The Polish language and literature still flourish despite the efforts of three great powers to suppress them .

		The Norman conquerors ' helpless surrender to a despised tongue is a matter of familiar history .

		Throughout our great English-speaking country are scattered families and communities that cling for a while to the mother tongue they have brought with them from over-seas , but the assimilation by us of these alien elements is only a question of time .

		Attempts to discourage or to prevent the teaching of this or that foreign language in this or that public school , or to keep out of the public libraries books dear to the hearts of those who as yet know no English -- even where such attempts seek to justify themselves under the name of patriotism -- are ill - advised .

		Too much that styles itself patriotism is nothing but magnified selfishness .

		Exclusion laws and tariff walls , whatever their necessity or merits , represent , in the large , a greedy boy 's determination to eat his big apple undiminished by a single bite .

		As the greater includes the less , so the love of man - kind includes the love of country ; and more and more , as the world emerges from its dark age of illiteracy , is it coming to be recognized that all nations are members one of another , and whether one member suffer , all the members suffer with it ; or one member be honored , all the members re - joice with it .

		With this principle in mind , even if held as a theory of doubtful application in all cases , most persons will commend King Oscar 's establishment of Swedish circulating libraries for Swedish Americans .

		The English-speaking children and grandchildren of these settlers will be all the heartier supporters of our own public-library system for the consideration thus shown to their elders .

		In dealing with the adult immigrant of alien speech , an impatient person is prone to forget , what
Bacon	PERSON	has so well expressed , that '' in languages the tongue is more pliant to all expressions and sounds , the joints are more supple to all feats of activity and motions in youth , than afterwards ; for it is true that late learners can not so well take the ply , except it be in some minds that have not suffered themselves to fix , but have kept themselves open and prepared to receive continual amendment , which is exceeding rare . ''

		Finally , may it not be that many a foreign - born citizen loves his adoptive country so much only because he is permitted to love his native land still more -- because he lives in a town or village or large city that helps to keep alive this love of the mother country by generously providing books to read in the mother tongue ?

		66 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, CASUAL COMMENT .

		Thk death of
Louise de la Ramee	ORGANIZATION	, far better known as ''
Ouida	PERSON	, '' brings to its close a career as im - possibly romantic and extravagant as that of one of her typical heroines .

		Having published her first novel in
1863	DATE	and reached the height of her popularity in the late seventies , '' Ouida '' lived to see the passing of the age of sentimentality and the rise of a new school of novel-writing that should conform to the more exact - ing standards of an increasingly sophisticated public .

		Nevertheless , she continued to stem the tide with a book or so a year , publishing her '' Critical Studies '' and `` The Waters of Edera '' in
1900	DATE	, and `` Street Dust '' in
1901	DATE	.

		But while her novels have passed into obscurity and are spoken of nowadays chiefly to be held up to ridicule , her stories for children -- `` A Dog of Flanders , '' `` Bimbi , '' and `` Two Little Wooden Shoes '' -- are , oddly enough , almost classic .

		Herself a primi - tive nature , she was naturally at her best in writing of peasants and children -- simple , single-hearted , pas - sionate creatures like herself , who live in a world where fact and fancy mingle and the boundaries between real and ideal are often lost sight of .

		That was the only world `` Ouida '' knew .

		Equally impractical in managing her personal afPairs and the plots of her novels , she is said to have died in abject poverty , the fortune that her books had earned for her gone , and only a tiny pension that the English government had provided between her and starvation .

		And most of that , with cliaracteristic improvidence , she spent on her pet dogs .

		Undoubtedly the explanation of her once tremendous vogue lies in the fa `` t that her work was always sincere .

		She wrote , at her best and at her worst , to please herself , and there - fore she often pleased other people .

		Library progress in
Maryland	LOCATION	is slow -- slower than one would exjject it to be in a State having such ready communication , through its sea-ports , its great rivers and bays , and its many railways , with the outside world ; holding almost in its embrace the capital of the country ; and counting among its educational institutions the
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	and the
United States Naval Academy	ORGANIZATION	.

		The fifth annual report of the
Mary	PERSON	- land
State Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	, just issued , depicts a dearth of public libi-aries , and a lack of popular interest in libraries and literature that might far more naturally characterize a newer and less favorably situated
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Ross M. Diggs	PERSON	, field secretary of the commission , says in part : '' I find that many large towns are without any library facilities at all , and such is the condition of most of the small towns and villages , with a few striking exceptions .

		The mass of the people in our State are not a reading people , and consequently there is little demand among them for books .

		What books are read consist mainly of the most recent light literature ... It is a difficult problem to get a non-reading public to build and maintain libraries ; but it is possible to convert them gradually into a reading public which will demand books and , therefore , build libraries .

		It is the aim of the
Commission	ORGANIZATION	first to stimulate a demand for books , and next to help and guide the people to the attauiment of the means for meeting their wants . ''

		The starting of a small collection of books by the villagers themselves is regarded as the first and the important step ; after that , state aid and local support by taxation will be more successfully solicited .

		Here is a field for missionary labor on the part of library workers .

		It is encour - aging to read that eighty-one travelling hbraries have circulated in nineteen of the twenty-three counties .


Washington County	LOCATION	is omitted from this list ; but the good work done by the library-wagon sent out by the
Hagerstown Free Library	ORGANIZATION	, as noted nearly a year ago in these columns , should not be overlooked .

		The mission of the newspaper is the subject of a recent newspaper article from the pen of a
Baltimore	LOCATION	doctor of divinity .

		The daily paper , even the sensa - tional Simday paper , is praised in terms that glow to the point of incandescence .

		A curious argument in favor of the Simday journal is that its reading supplies Qccupation for the thousands who , in every large city , could not possibly find even standing-room in the churches .

		To this an opponent might urge that if there were fewer
Sunday	DATE	papers there would perhaps be more churches .

		The endless debate this might lead to is not in place here .

		Let us instead quote a few of the rev - erend doctor 's rhapsodical Sentences in praise of news - papers in general . ''

		There is no literature for the common people , '' he declares , `` like that of the news - paper .

		It is the daily companion alike of the prince and the peasant , the man who inherits and the man who earns , of the millionaire in his mansion and the laborer in his cot .

		It comes as regularly as the glow of the lamplight , and finds a welcome at every fireside .

		If the night be fair , if the winter 's storm beats madly at the window pane , it does not matter -- this messenger is present to entertain and instruct , to tell to willing ears in that little circle what is going on in the great bustling world without .

		A good paper , secular or religious , is a blessing in the home ... Oh , for the day when these white-winged can-ier doves shall be all and more than our highest and best ideal ! ''

		All this , and more , appearing in a
Baltimore	LOCATION	paper at the same time with the publication of the
State Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	's report of
Maryland	LOCATION	's sad lack of interest in books and public collections of books , as set forth in the precedmg para - graph , might suggest some curious comment , from which , however , we refrain .

		It is at least gratifying to note that the newspaper whose
Sunday	DATE	issue prints the clergyman 's interesting contribution is one of the best in the city -- and , in fact , in the country .

		• • • Public library organization unassisted by legislation has now been entered upon by
Kansas	LOCATION	; so that , whatever may still be the matter with that
State	ORGANIZATION	, she is no longer to be reproached with inactivity in the matter of public libraries .

		Mr.
A. D. Dickinson	PERSON	, public librarian at
Leavenworth	LOCATION	, has been appointed temporary organizer for
the State	ORGANIZATION	by the
Kansas Library Associa	ORGANIZATION	- tion .

		The following is from an explanatory statement issued by him to libraries and citizens of Kansas : '' Many libraries are being established in this
State	ORGANIZATION	to-daj .

		The library interests of Kansas require the immediate ser - vices of an organizer .

		Convinced of this , and havmg thus far been unable to secure the necessary legislation , the
Kansas Library Association	ORGANIZATION	at its annual meeting in
October	DATE	appointed one of its members to act temporarily in that capacity , in order to demonstrate practically the usefulness of such an officer .

		In performance of his duties the organizer will considt with towns plaiming the organization or reorganization of public libraries on all matters pertaining to the architecture , the adminis - tration , and the technical work of libraries ; he will assist in framing city ordinances for the maintenance of libraries ; and he will spare no effort which will help

		Therefore the organizer 's services are rendered gratis , except for travelling and hotel ex - penses .

		Another illustration , this , of generous effort for the public gootl , put forth without hope of material reward , by those engaged in library work .

		• • • The book record of
1907	DATE	in
England	LOCATION	shows that year to have been a pi-osperous or at least a busy one with English publishers .

		They issued nearly ten thous - and books -- or , more exactly ,
9914	DATE	, of which 7701 were new , the remainder being new editions .

		In
1906	DATE	the corresponding figures were
8603	DATE	and
6985	DATE	, showing gains of
1311	DATE	and 716 , respectively .

		Thus it appears that the manufacture of books increased 15 per cent .

		The increase in readers -- that is , in population -- could not have been nearly so great ; hence it must have been a year of activity for readei-s as well as publishers , unless an unusual proportion of books went misold and unread , which does not appear to have been the case .

		An encouraging sign in some respects is the falling off in the publication of fiction , from
2108	DATE	to
1862	DATE	, and the considerable increase in theology -LRB- who would have thought it ? -RRB-

		, history , and biography .

		It may be that novel-readers turned in greater numbers than usual from pure fiction to its next of kin , gossipy biogi-aphy and reminiscences .

		But the serious bent indicated by the unusual demand for -LRB- or supply of -RRB- works on religion is difficult to account for in this openuig twentieth century .

		Is it possible that the Christian world is already begin - ning to get itself into a fit frame of mind fot ' the second millennium , ninety-two years hence ?

		• • • The needs of the children as library-users are in some quarters receiving what a childless adult might think to be undue attention .

		Whether the English authority on library administration , Mr.
James Duff Brown	PERSON	, is unblessed with offspring , or has a quiverful , we do not know ; but in the revised edition of his '' Manual of Library Economy '' he takes occasion to say : '' When a public libraiy has provided an adequate children 's room , and reduced its age limit to a reason - able and liberal degree , it has done all that is necessary or desirable without trenching upon the work of the public schools or fostering this particular class of youthful citizen at the expense of liis seniors who have to find the money .

		With all respect for the admirable work in connection with children 's libraries and the cultivation of intimate relationship with the public schools , both in the
United States	LOCATION	and in
Britain	LOCATION	, there is a very grave danger of this particular outlet for lib - rary enthusiasm becoming a damaging influence on the interests of the general work of public Ubraries .

		Already there are libraries in the
United States	LOCATION	and iii
England	LOCATION	where everything is subordinated to the special cult of the child , and where the claims of adult readers are being brushed aside in the pursuit of what is largely , in many cases , a sentimental fantasy . ''

		At the same tune with this protest there comes from the Examining Conmiittee of the
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	a complaint that '' too much is done for the child , not enough for the adult , '' with interesting particulars .

		There is little doubt that sometimes libraries of enterprise and ambi - tion engage in work that might better be left to the schools .

		The circulation of serious books is encouraged by all wise librarians , and a plan has been proposed in
London	LOCATION	for increasing this circulation .

		Those who read nothing but fiction , which in most cases means the worst fiction , are to be required -LRB- if the plan is ever carried out -RRB- to draw with every novel a work of soberer cast , chosen either by themselves or by the attendant .

		The absurdity of it all is not entirely ignored by the author of the plan ; but he argues that , although no one can com - pel the reading of the serious book , it may be taken up by some member of the family and at least dipped into .

		Its presence on the sitting-room table is more conducive to this than is its undisturbed repose on the library shelf .

		Although such an exercise of paternalism on the part of the library authorities would be of questionable wisdom , an intelligent and observant desk-attendant can always accomplish something -LRB- if not overburdened with work -RRB- by gently and unobtiiisively directing attention to the choice flowers of literature -LRB- not fiction -RRB- wasting their sweetness on the musty air of the stock-room .

		A desk - attendant of oiu - acquaintance -- one of the imintelligent , unobservant sort -- once showed great perplexity and even consternation on being asked to recommend some good book to an applicant whose literary yearnings were of the vaguest .

		Such a request evidently struck this slave of routine and red tape as most irregular and be - wildering .

		... A growing interest in library news appears from the increasing frequency with which such news is printed in our daily and weekly papers .

		The
Boston	LOCATION	'' Transcript '' -- one of the few journals that as yet maintain a regular library department , and one of the best in this respect -- takes occasion to commend The Dial for publishing library notes . ''

		The Dial , '' it says , '' nearly always contains interesting library news , preferring , as a rule , the human and generally interest - ing side of library work to its statistical features . ''

		The same writer kmdly corrects a false impression conveyed by a recent paragraph m these columns .

		The paragraph contained a reference to the `` Letters of a Chinese Official , '' and , says our courteous critic , '' gave the im - pression that the reply to the book by Mr.
William J. Bryan	PERSON	was suppressed before publication .

		If The Dial cares to look at the book in the
Chicago Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, it can find that Mr.
Bryan	PERSON	says , in a pref atorj - note , that he wrote his reply believing the ' Letters ' to be the work of a genuine Chinaman .

		Before publica - tion he learned that an Englishman was the real author , but he decided to publish his work without alteration . ''

		• • • Magazine madness has never been more amusingly displayed than in the current announcement of a new sensational periodical .

		In its illustrations the new pub - lication seems bent on rivalling the rainbow in poly - chromatic brilhance : it is , in fact , advertised as `` the hottest pictorial proposition that ever hit a news-stand . ''

		And further , `` if this brand-new idea in magazine mak - ing does not wake you up you are hopelessly asleep . ''

		Therefore '' get a copy next issue , and wake up !

		Its pages teem with smashing good fiction , irresistible humor , serials that grip the human heart , things that appeal to the finer sensibilities , and special articles that will keep you entranced , enthralled , and make you watch anxiously for the next issue -- which will be better still . ''

		If the first number is to send the reader into such a delirium of rapture , it is to be feared that the next , '' which will be better still , '' will fairly paralyze him -- will produce an effect so stunning as to be fatal .

		The very name of 68 THE DIAL -LSB-

Washington	LOCATION	took about three months ' time .

		Some nine thousand works on

Dr. Asakawa of Yale	ORGANIZATION	.

		Another evidence of the rapid growth of this vast collection of books is furnished by the superinten - dent 's call for more shelving .

		The year 's events in the library world , as noted by '' Public Libraries '' in reviewing the most important happenings of
1907	DATE	in our library activity , were the discussion of the subject of permanent head - quarters for the
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	; the discontinuance of official relations between this associa - tion and '' The Library Journal '' ; the Copyright League 's opposition , apparently successful , to the restriction of free importation of books for public libra - ries ; the begimiing of state commission work for libraries in

		COMMUNICA TION .

		PROBLEMS OF THE SMALLER LIBRARIES .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		As trustee of a village library , I was interested in a note in a recent number of your journal , concerning the professional status and pay of librarians .

		Were it not for the occasional library notes in the pages of
The Dial	ORGANIZATION	, I should begin to think that the old ideal of hav - ing in the library a man or a woman who loves books -LRB- and their contents -RRB- had passed away , -- this type which , professional or not , has been sought so eagerly by library boards among the graduates of library schools and else - where .

		There is a pretty widespread feeling , I find , that library schools do not inculcate this kind of profession - alism , but , rather , a spirit which is radically different .

		Certain it is that , whatever the aim of the schools , some trustees who have had experience with graduates of extended library courses have found them willing -- shall I say eager ?

		-- to forget much of the instruction that had been given them , or else so tired of the backs of books that they could not care for their contents .

		This is hardly a professional spirit .

		In the smaller libra - ries the librarians spend perforce the largest part of their time in such-work as cutting leaves , stamping books and magazines , placing papers on the racks and books on the shelves , charging and receiving books at the desk , writing catalogue cards , and doing simple bookkeeping .

		And this is hardly professional work .

		I have read of librarians who in addition to these duties , and some others that might be called professional , lured children to the library building and then to good reading by beautiful stories , or enticed adult appetites jaded by bad fiction to try some more substantial food , aud by their personal activities invigorated the intellectual life of the entire community .

		But the small urban library , which perhaps most needs such personalities , almost never can find them , even among those who are '' professionally '' trained .

		The problem that confronts a multitude of small libraries with mcomes from
$ 1000	MONEY	to
$ 3500	MONEY	is to save enough money , after the running expenses are paid , to buy books .

		And it has seemed to more than one board of trustees that it was not justified in paying the salai-y , small though it is , of a graduate of a librarj ' school for such service as is rendered .

		Many of these boards , having the best interest of the library sincerely at heart , do not believe that the position of librarian should be filled by someone whose only qualification is that she has failed at teaching school or that she needs the financial help .

		That is not the alternative .

		There are in many commimities men and women who , after short training , or by the exercise of common sense and by private study , can perform all the mechanical work of the library , and get other results fairly satisfactory to the community , even to those who are discriminating .

		Although untrained in the schools , they after a while learn the use of the few reference books that the small library afPords ; and if they are lovers of learning and of letters , they are of genuine help to the book com - mittee in the selection of new books .

		There remains the `` classification according to Dewey . ''

		This is not the time to voice a complaint , which is as widespread among book-lovers as are books , against the '' system '' ; it is now so generally used that we probably must accept it .

		But when trained librarians classify Trilby under French fiction ,
N. P. Willis	PERSON	imder British poets , widely separate two books by the same author on the same subject , and are unable to agree on other classifications even after knowing what the books con - tain , -- to illustrate briefly from personal observation , -- it is no longer any wonder that the untrained make errors .

		So my practical suggestion is this : If some library school , some board , or , preferably , the Library of Con - gress , would furnish upon application at a moderate price the correct classification of books according to the
Dewey Decimal System	ORGANIZATION	, to which most libraries here - abouts are committed , small libraries could then secure service adequate to their needs and at the same time save enough money to buy some books wth which to justify their existence .

		Even an entei ` prising book - supply house might satisfy this demand and incidentally enlarge its business .

		Of course the
American Library Association Catalogue	ORGANIZATION	and Monthly Book List do this in a partial way , and some of these classification numbers are copied on the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	cards ; but so far as I have been able to learn from professional librarians , there is no source from which one may secure the cor - rect classification of all books that a library may care to buy .

		THE DIAL 69 X Mito laohs .

		An Irish Poet 's Literary Friendships .

		* Clearness , simplicity , and a modest charm of their own are found in the poems , now ap - parently little read , of
William Allingham	PERSON	of
Ballyshannon	LOCATION	-- for there he was born , in
1824	DATE	, and there he spent much of his early life , cultivating his muse and sitting at the receipt of customs .

		His custom-house activities , much earlier entered upon and longer continued than
Hawthorne	PERSON	's , were not entirely suspended until
1870	DATE	, when he settled in
London	LOCATION	and assumed the sub-editorship , under Fronde , of ''
Fraser	PERSON	's Magazine . ''

		Meantime he had shifted from place to place , at one short period relinquishing his government position and trying a
London	LOCATION	literary life -LRB- which he speedily abandoned be - cause he would be no publisher 's hack -RRB- , and at all times writing , and occasionally publishing , verses that enjoyed a more or less pronounced success in the world of letters .

		In spite of his ambitious narrative poem in heroic metre , ''
Laurence Bloomfield	PERSON	in
Ireland	LOCATION	, '' which he put forth in his prime and regarded as his most import - ant work , we think of him as an English rather than an Irish poet , and take far more pleasure in his short and simple '' Day and Night Songs '' than in that rather formidable social document which exhibits the fortunes of his Hibernian hero .

		In ''
William Allingham	PERSON	: a Diary '' is pre - sented a fairly complete account , in a necessarily disjointed style , of the poet 's life .

		The first thirty-three pages of the book are written out in autobiographic form , and bring AUingham 's life down to his twenty-third year .

		At this point in the text the purpose of leaving behind him a full and formal autobiography seems to have been abandoned by the poet , and the rest of the book , which extends to four hundred ample pages , is made up of extracts from a very full but hastily written diary , with occasional passages of connect - ing narrative from Mrs.
AUingham	PERSON	's pen , where the regular entries are for any cause intermitted .

		AUingham 's intimacy with
Rossetti	PERSON	was brought to notice by the appearance in '' The
Atlantic Monthly	LOCATION	, '' twelve years ago , of the pre -
Raphaelite	ORGANIZATION	's letters -LRB- considered the best he ever wrote -RRB- to the Irish-bom poet .

		And this was by no means the only literary friendship that
Allingham	PERSON	formed in
London	LOCATION	: his diary shows him to have been a welcome guest at the homes of nearly all the writing folk of his time .

Burne-Jones	PERSON	,
Browning	PERSON	,
Rossetti	PERSON	,
Tennyson	LOCATION	,
Carlyle	LOCATION	, and many others .

		So con - stant a visitor was he to the house in CReyne Row that

		Taken from school at fourteen to go into a bank at
Ballyshannon	LOCATION	, whence he soon entered the customs service ,
Allinghatn	PERSON	was forced to educate himself in all branches higher than the rudiments of learning ; and it speaks well for his industry and his good natural parts that he was able to stand on a footing of equality with contemporary English men of letters .

Edwardes Square	LOCATION	, and And
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	at last .

		I was shown into the study and had some minutes to look roimd at the Book-cases , Busts , old framed engravings , and to glance at some of the books on the table , diligently marked and noted in the well-known neatest of hand-writings .

		Outside the window climbed a hop on its trellis .

		The door opened and in came the
Genius Loci	ORGANIZATION	, a tallish yomig old man , in dark dressing-gown and mde turned-down shirt - collar , his copious iron-gray hair falling almost to his shoulders .

		The friendly brown eyes , simple yet fine - toned voice , easy hand-pressure , gave me greeting as to one already well-known to him .

		Our talk fell first on reason and instinct ; he maintained -LRB- for argument 's sake , I thought -RRB- that beasts maybe equal or superior to men .

		He has a light earnestness of manner , and toleration for almost every possible different point of view from his own .

		Of freewill he said , ' I would much rather be without it .

		I should like to feel myself taken care of in the arms of beneficent power ...

		T. takes me upstairs to his * den ' on the top-story , and liigher , up a ladder , to the leads .

		He often comes up here a-night to look at the heavens .

		One night he was watching shooting-stars and tumbled through the hatchway , falling on the floor below , a height of at least ten feet I should say .

		The ladder probably broke his fall and he was not hurt .

		I quoted ' A certain star shot madly from his sphere . ' ''

		70 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, A still further excerpt , referring to an earlier visit at the
Tennyson	PERSON	home , is worth giving for its introduction of
Edward FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	as raconteur .

		The story he tells is found somewhere in his letters , but may be not too stale for reproduction here . ''

		Returning to the drawing-room I found Mrs.

		She used to take it off for coolness and resume it when visitors were announced .

		One day by some mischance a strange gentleman came into the room and found her writing with her almost bald pate plainly visible .

		Miss E. started up with the greatest agility , seized her turban which lay close by , and darted through an opposite door , whence she quickly reappeared with the decoration upon her head , but unluckily turned wrong side foremost . ''

		Carlyle figures frequently in the diary , and many of his sayings are quoted -- all character - istic , but not often of any great moment .

		The following remarks are as quotable as any . ''

		C. spoke of
Sydney Smith	ORGANIZATION	, to whom he was able to give no praise at all . '

		Tlie nature of true Wit is very much misunderstood .


Sydney	LOCATION	said nothing worth re - membering .

		He said '' it took a surgical operation to get a joke into a Scotchman 's head '' ; the thing is , that what
Sydney	LOCATION	presented was not a joke worth admitting into any one 's head , and the
Scotchman	PERSON	refused to have anything to do with it .

		The Scotch are a people with a large appreciation of fim very generally among them .

		... I remember seeing
Sydney Smith	ORGANIZATION	setting himself to make a company laugh , and I left him there at it , reflecting what a wretched ambition it was in any man . '

		... He spoke of a debate long ago at the
London Library	LOCATION	about the appointment of a Librarian .

		C. was for one man ,
Gladstone	PERSON	for a certain Italian .

		C. said : ' I discovered then that
Gladstone	PERSON	had the art of speak - ing .

		He and I were like
Valentine	ORGANIZATION	and
Orson	LOCATION	.

		I laid about with a rough club , he got up in shining armour and drew his sword .

		But all in vain , too ; by no sleight of fence could he carry his point . ' ''

		AHingham died on the
18th November , 1889	DATE	.

		Shortly before he drew his last breath he said , '' I am seeing things that you know nothing of . ''

		By his express wish , his body was cremated , no funeral service being held , and only a few relatives and friends being present at the crema - tion .

		Mr.
F. G. Stephens	PERSON	, the oldest of the assembled friends , read aloud
Allingham	PERSON	's own '' Poet 's Epitaph , '' -- '' Body to purifying flame .

		Soul to the Great Deep whence it came .

		In literary charm the book suffers from being so largely a rudis indigestaqve moles -- for which , however , no one is to blame , unless we choose to quarrel with the dead poet for drop - ping so soon the autobiography that he had begun to frame out of his diary material .

		The
Case Against Government Ownership	ORGANIZATION	.

		* '' Municipal Ownership in
Great Britain	LOCATION	'' and '' The British State Telegraphs '' are the titles of the second and third volumes in a series of five books which Professor
Hugo Meyer	PERSON	, formerly of
the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, has vmdertaken to write on public regulation and government ownership and operation of the public-service industries -- the railway , the tele - graph , the street railway , the electric light , and the telephone .

		The first volume , published more than a year ago , dealt with government regulation of railway rates , and attracted special attention on account of the author 's strong opposition to such regulation .

		The volume on '' Municipal Ownership '' covers rather fully the industries of street rail - ways , gas , and electric light , and altogether con - tains a formidable argument against the policy indicated by the title .

		That policy , the author maintains , has wellnigh paralyzed street-railway building in the
United Kingdom	LOCATION	and placed the tramway industry on a losing financial basis .

		Comparing English and American conditions , he reaches the conclusion that the people living in the cities and towns of the
United Kingdom	LOCATION	have at their service less than a quarter of the street-railway facilities enjoyed by people living in the towns and cities of the
United States	LOCATION	-LRB- p. 91 -RRB- .

United Kingdom	LOCATION	, in
January , 1906	DATE	, been as well supplied with electric street-railways as was the urban population of the

United Kingdom	LOCATION	own their gas-plants , of which only forty per cent are on a paying basis -LRB- p. 174 -RRB- .

		Compared with the
United States	LOCATION	, the electric light facilities of the
United Kingdom	LOCATION	are grossly inadequate .

		In
June , 1902	DATE	, there were , he says , 3620 central electric stations in American cities as against 457 in
1904	DATE	in British municipalities -LRB- p. 261 -RRB- .

		After British cities had '' paralyzed individual initiative and private adventure '' by municipal ownership , the cities themselves declined to step in and supply the needed facilities which other - wise would have been provided .

		The cities of
Great Britain	LOCATION	, the author asserts , have thus far shown themselves incapable of utilizing fully the industries given them ready-made by the American captains of industry .

		They have failed to '' suburbanize '' their populations by means of adequate transportation facilities , and have thereby shown an '' indifference to and a disregard of the public health , physical as well as moral , that for brutality have no parallel in the records of private industry . ''

		Scarcely less brutal , he contends , is the disregard by British cities of the welfare of the hundred thousand people who might find employment in the electrical industries if the cities would but re - move their paralyzing hand -LRB- p. 324 -RRB- .

		Professor
Meyer	PERSON	's conclusions are as follows : `` The upshot of thirty-five years of action upon the doctrine that the public service industries that make use of the public streets differ from ordinary trading and manufacturing ventures , and must be made to share their profits with the public at large , is that the people of the
United Kingdom	LOCATION	have at their disposal about one-quarter the street railway facilities , one-third the electric lighting facilities , and less than one-quarter the telephone facilities , that they would have to have before they could be said to be as well supplied with these facilities as are the people of the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		Professor
Meyer	PERSON	's third volume , like the second , might well be styled '' the case against government ownership , '' for his indictment against state ownership of the telegraph is no less strong than that against the municipaliza - tion of the street railways .

		It will be remem - bered that the British government took over the telegraph lines of the
United Kingdom	LOCATION	in
1870	DATE	, paying therefor
$ 40,000,000	MONEY	, which Mr.
Meyer	PERSON	thinks was excessive -LRB- p. 5 -RRB- .

		The com - plaints against private ownership and operation were that the charges were too high , a fact which tended to check the growth of telegraphic correspondence ; that there were frequent de - lays of messages ; that many important com - munities were unprovided with telegraphic facil - ities ; and that in many places the telegraph office was inconveniently remote from the centre of business .

		It was pointed out that the expe - rience of
Belgium	LOCATION	and
Switzerland	LOCATION	with state ownership had been very successful , having greatly stimulated the growth of telegraphic correspondence by a substantial reduction of charges .

		But , according to Mr.
Meyer	PERSON	, the expectations of the friends of state ownership in
England	LOCATION	have not been realized .

		The revenues have , with rare exceptions , fallen below the amount estimated , while the expenses of opera - tion have been excessive -LRB- pp. 87 , 386 -RRB- .

		On the whole , he concludes that the verdict of British experience under public ownership and operation has shown the doctrine to be untenable .

		Instead of purifjring politics it has corrupted politics bj ^ giving a great impetus to the '' insidious practice of class bribery '' -LRB- p. 387 -RRB- .

		In one respect he admits that nationalization of the telegraph has met the expectations of its advocates , -- namely , in the enormous extension of telegraphic corre - spondence , though too often this relates to mat - ters the encouragement of which by the state may well be open to question .

J. Percy	PERSON	and His Dinner-Guests .

		* In ``
Earl Percy	PERSON	's Dinner - Table '' Mr.
Murdock	PERSON	has produced an unusual book -- an historical monograph possessing both unques - tionable authenticity and rare distinction of style .

		Its plan and the stately classicism of its style suggest Landor 's '' Imaginary Conver - sations '' ; its method of research , Mr
Austin Dobson	PERSON	's '' Eighteenth Century Vignettes . ''

		A light touch , a vivid imagination , a gift for the illuminating epithet that shall paint a character , picture a scene , or produce an atmosphere , -- these are the qualities that distinguish Mr.
* Eabl Percy	PERSON	's Dinner-Table .

		By
Harold Murdock	PERSON	.

		Bos - ton :
Houghton	LOCATION	,
MiflBin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		72 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	,
Murdock	PERSON	's little book .

		Already known as the author of several important historical works , he now shows that he can clothe dry bones and make them live , -- not in the hackneyed form of historical fiction but as a rare and refreshing bit of imaginative history .

		Issued as one of the
Riverside Press	ORGANIZATION	special editions , the volume is printed and bound in a fashion that suits its unusual quality .

		The only illustration is the frontispiece , which shows an engraved portrait of
Earl Percy	PERSON	by
Sidney L. Smith	PERSON	, from a print in the author 's possession , combined , within a graceful border , with a modern vignette of the
Earl	ORGANIZATION	's dinner-table .

		Mr.
Murdock	PERSON	has chosen the dinner-table in
Earl Percy	PERSON	's Winter Street house as a conven - ient vantage-point from which to survey the life of
Boston	LOCATION	in
1774	DATE	.

		The episode falls into three parts : the first , opening with a vivid account of the landing of
Percy	PERSON	's regiment in
Boston	LOCATION	, characterizes the
Earl	PERSON	and a group of his officers , and relates , as an extract from the -LRB- non-existent -RRB- journal of Captain
William Glanville Evelyn	PERSON	of '' The King 's Own , '' the conversation at one of the
Earl	ORGANIZATION	's dinners ; the second is concerned with the battles of
Concord	LOCATION	and Bunker Hill and the dark days that followed , when , for obAdous reasons , '' dinner-giving was going out of fashion in
Boston	LOCATION	, '' and the evacuation of the town was only a matter of time ; the third is in the nature of an after-piece , sketching briefly the future careers -- in
America	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	, or
India	LOCATION	-- of the gallant group of officers who had been wont to gather around
Earl Percy	PERSON	's hos - pitable board .

		The chief authorities for the more original features of the narrative are
Earl Percy	PERSON	's own letters , those of
John Andrews	PERSON	, Mrs.
Boscawen	LOCATION	, Lady
Sarah Bunbury	PERSON	, and others , and the files of the
Boston	LOCATION	newspapers of the day , -- sources which are indicated in an appendix of notes .

		A complete bibliography would extend to alarm - ing proportions , and include every available book , pamphlet , and document ; for it is evident that the easy , unstudied manner of the narrative is due to the author 's perfect acquaintance not only with the episodes which his book touches upon but also with the entire history of the period .

		In its main outlines , the story of the
Boston	LOCATION	siege is as familiar as any in our history ; but with the stately
Earl Percy	PERSON	in the foregTound , in place of
Paul Revere	PERSON	and the
Concord	LOCATION	minute - men , it takes on a fresh interest .

		The
Earl	PERSON	wrote home of
Boston	LOCATION	, -- its people , whom he called '' a set of sly , artfid , hypocritical rascalls , cruel , and cowards , '' and its climate , which took him to '' the Torrid and Frigid Zone frequently in the space of 24 hours . ''

		In order that he might enjoy the scenery of the suburbs he bought a riding-horse , for which he paid X450 , and sent to
New York	LOCATION	'' for a pair of chaise horses that were to liis mind . ''

		Then he rented a house , pleasantly situated within its garden at the head of Whiter Street , and was ready to play the host '' to the officers of the Line and occasionally the Gentlemen of the Country . '' ''

		It is pleasant to see him crossing the Common each afternoon to do the honors of his mansion , and day hy day and week by week it is interesting to watch his guests passing in and out the great door .

		It opens to officers in scarlet and gold , and to officers in the blue of the
Royal Navy	ORGANIZATION	, to gentlemen in silk and brocade , and to gentlemen in velvet and lace .

		Old Dr.
Caner	PERSON	goes up the path leaning upon his stick , the great coach of
Colonel Royall	ORGANIZATION	lumbers up to the garden gate , the chaise of Judge Lee waits in
Winter	DATE	Street to cany his Honor back to
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		All those who love the King within this stern old
New England	LOCATION	town rejoice in the polite summons that brings them to
Earl Percy	PERSON	's dinner-table . ''

		At the particular dinner that Captain
Evelyn	PERSON	describes , the civilian element was ably repre - sented by the Reverend
Mather Byles	PERSON	, preacher , poet , and mt , arrant Tory and so `` in the eyes of the army the most sensible as well as the most delightful clergyman in
Boston	LOCATION	. ''

		The other places were filled by army and navy officers , invited to meet
Lord Percy	PERSON	's boy friend , young
Roger Sheaffe	PERSON	, who is about sailing for
England	LOCATION	to study for a commission . ''

		The
Earl	ORGANIZATION	has presented him to-night to his future comrades of the army , and the radiant face of the boy must be a pleasant sight in his lordship 's eyes . ''

		Pleasant banter over the boy 's ambition to - ' wear the red coat '' runs around the table .

		Doctor
Byles	PERSON	's witty sallies throw old Major Pitcaim into convtdsions of mirth .

		Local affairs ,
London	LOCATION	scandal and literary gossip fur - nish topics of conversation .

		The
Earl	PERSON	, who pre - sides gracefully , asks Dr.
Byles	PERSON	if he admires the verse of Dr.
Goldsmith	PERSON	, lately deceased . ''

		Dr.
Byles	PERSON	replied that he regarded
Goldsmith	PERSON	as an ingenious man of excellent promise , though not to be compared with his old friend and correspondent , Mr.
Pope	PERSON	. ''

		Then
Earl Percy	PERSON	spoke of his family 's connec - tion with the poet , and Captain
Harry Fox	PERSON	,
Lord Holland	PERSON	's '' only good son , '' recalled his brother
Charles	PERSON	's acquaintance with him . ''

		He feared that the poet 's death had been hastened by the burden of heavy debts .

		Here
Gould	PERSON	muttered in my ear to wonder whether , if
Lord Holland	PERSON	had not come to the financial relief of
Charles Fox	PERSON	, that portly gambler would have been crushed as easily as the
Duke	ORGANIZATION	's scribbling friend from Grub Street . ''


1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAl ^ 78 It is all veiy courtly and care-free ; but when the time for work comes these leisurely diners - out prove themselves excellent fighters .

		As for
Earl Percy	PERSON	's scornful estimate of the colonists , he was prompt to revise it on the evidence of
April	DATE	nineteenth , in writing of which he paid high and generous tribute to their courage and perseverance .

		Mr.
Murdoch	PERSON	describes the Earl reviewing his brigade on the morning of that fateful day . ''

		And the expression on his Lordship 's face is not tlie one we find in Mr.
Stuart	PERSON	's painting , nor that familiar to guests at his dinner-table . ''

		But the
Earl	PERSON	and his friends were not yet discouraged .

		Dinner-giving went merrily on in
Boston	LOCATION	, with the choice of guests greatly augumented by the advent of many frightened loyalists and the arrival of the frigate
Cerberus	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		One is tempted to glance again into the old dining - room and mark the new faces that gather there , to hear
Colonel Saltonstall	PERSON	and Mr.
Vassall	PERSON	lament the incon - veniences of the time , to hear
Clinton	PERSON	tell his memories of the fighting Prince of
Brunswick	LOCATION	, and listen to Bur - goyne 's graceful and racy recital of the gossip that is amusing high life in
London	LOCATION	. ''

		But soon came the disillusionment of Bunker Hill , and then , after a long cold winter -- enliv - ened chiefly by
Burgoyne	PERSON	's ^ vit as a playwright -- the evacuation , and the scattering of
Earl Percy	PERSON	's dinner-guests to the four comers of the earth .

		It is the best possible evidence of Mr.
Murdock	PERSON	's art that we read of their future careers with interest , and part from them , after so slight an acquaintance , as from friends .


Edith Kellogmj Dunton	PERSON	.

		A
Max	ORGANIZATION	from
Maine	LOCATION	.

		* In the political lingo of a few years ago '' The man from
Maine	LOCATION	'' was a very common expression ; but it did not mean the man who is really best entitled to rank as
Maine	LOCATION	's prime contribution to American statesmanship .

		The name of
William Pitt Fessenden	PERSON	has figured little in the press of the present generation , nor have the writers of
United States	LOCATION	histories made it familiar to the children of the public schools .

		The appearance of his biography , however , will awaken very vivid recollections in the minds of men who lived through the Civil War and the troubled era of Reconstruction .

		Blaine and
Thomas B. Reed	PERSON	come most readily to mind to-day , when the
State of Maine	LOCATION	is mentioned ; but it lay not in the character of Blaine nor in * Life and
Public Services	ORGANIZATION	op
William Pitt Fessenden	PERSON	.

		By his son ,
Francis Fessenden	PERSON	.

		In two volumes .

		Boston :
Houghton	LOCATION	.


Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		the opportunities of
Reed	ORGANIZATION	-- perhaps not in the native ability or acquired knowledge of either - -- to render to the country the enormous and vital services rendered by
Fessenden	PERSON	during the eight years which remained to him after the outbreak of the Civil War .

		As one thinks of the long - train of evils which traces straight back to the sins and blunders of Civil War finance , it might not seem propitious to recall the fact that
Senator Fessenden	PERSON	was Chairman of the
Senate Finance Committee	ORGANIZATION	during the entire war period , except for the few months when he held the
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	portfolio after the resignation of Secretary Chase .

		The fact was , however , that his keen financial instinct scented the essential rottenness of every serious fallacy proposed , and these fallacies be - came a part of our law and practice only in cases where his wise advice went down before the unwisdom of superior numbers .

		The issue of legal-tender notes was against all his ideas of financial good sense and national honor ; and though compelled by the attitude of his Com - mittee to report the bill , he supported a motion to strike out the legal-tender clause on the floor of the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	.

		During the months of his service as Secretary of the
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	, 1864-65 , he success - fidly resisted all demands for currency inflation , not a dollar being added to the amount outstand - ing at his accession .

		It was his influence that secured the act of
March 3 , 1865	DATE	, forbidding the further issue of legal tenders ; and one of his first services on returning to the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	was to lead through that body , against the opposi - tion of
John Sherman	PERSON	, a bill to hasten the elimination of this dangerous element from our financial system .

		By
1868	DATE	, however , misguided public clamor swept the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	from its moor - ings and
Fessenden	PERSON	was one of but four who had the moral courage to stand out against the repeal of this wise provision .

		That much of the financial folly and disaster of the past forty years might liave been spared but for the throw - ing overboard of the trained pilot , is the opinion of practically every well-equipped student of our financial history to-day .

		But the crowning display of Senator
Fessen	PERSON	- den 's sound sense and moral courage was his defeat -- for it was essentially his -- of the ill - advised movement to get rid of a politically obnoxious President by impeachment .

		The case is all the more striking in that
Fessenden	PERSON	, though a thoroughly kind man at heart , was by tem - perament extremely irritable under the stimulus of just such foolish conduct as President
John	PERSON	- son was continually perpetrating , and there was really no more effective opponent of all the 74 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, President 's distinctive policies in the entire
Senate	ORGANIZATION	than
Fessenden	PERSON	himself .

		As one reads his private letters during this trying period , as well as his public utterances , it is clear that his merely human impulses were urging him all the time toward conviction , not because conviction was the thunderous demand of his party , but because the President 's course was in almost all its essential features utterly repugnant to his ideas of right and of the country 's welfare .

		But over against all this was the one fact of his sworn obligation as an honest man to decide the case before him in xigid accordance with the law and the evidence .

		It would be hard to find a more temperate , dignified , and utterly crush - ing rejoinder , than his reply to a clamorous letter from
Neal Dow	PERSON	, demanding that he should '' hang
Johnson	PERSON	up by the heels like a dead crow in a cornfield , to frighten all his tribe . '' ''

		Eternal infamy ^ '' roared
Ben Butler	PERSON	, '' unless yon vote to convict ! ''

		And perhaps four - fifths of
Fessenden	PERSON	's constituents were suffi - ciently carried away by the excitement of the moment to echo
Butler	PERSON	's words .

		Forty years have passed since then .

		Blaine long ago apolo - gized at length , in his '' Twenty Years in Con - gress , '' for the part that he had taken in the Impeachment movement ; and his change of heart was shared by many another after passion had time to cool .

		The moral consciousness of
Maine	LOCATION	had largely righted itself towards its greatest and purest statesman within the one short year of life which remained to him after the famous trial closed , and it would be hard to find a sane man in the land to-day who would not be willing to have the career of
William Pitt Fessenden	PERSON	held up to his sons as a worthy example of upright , intelligent , and patriotic manhood .

		As for
Butler	PERSON	, dealing out his thunderbolts of eternal disgrace to those who woidd not fall in with a programme of pas - sionate partisanship of which he may now be recognized as a thorouglily fitting leader -- what better fate than silence can his great misuse of o-reat talents ever hope for ?

		As one reads over
Fessenden	PERSON	's recorded opmion m this historic case , together with the extracts which his biog - rapher includes from that of Sumner , he is forced to the conviction that here is a moral height which even Sumner , through his inability to control some of the prejudices and weaknesses which fastened themselves upon one of the great - est minds and hearts of the age , was unable to reach .


Fessenden	PERSON	's name , as has already been said , is not a part of the mental furniture of to-day .

		nor is his quiet and unassuming style of virtue exactly that which appeals to the popular taste in an age which admires men who '' do things '' more noisily than he , if not always more successfully .

		It is unfortunate , therefore , that his biography could not have had the benefit of competent literary training as well as filial affection .

		Still , after shortcomings on that score are discounted , one finds in this story of a public man who never '' put his ear to the ground '' to listen for the voice of duty , never `` climbed into the band - wagon '' in search of office , never chose to go against his conscientious judgment a hair 's breadth rather than '' get left , '' a piece of biog - raphy so morally invigorating as to deserve , in its own very different way , a place alongside the reminiscences of
Carl Schurz	PERSON	.


W. H. Johnson	PERSON	.

		Recent Poetry .

		* The '' New Poems '' of Mr.
Stephen Phillips	PERSON	will not add materially to his reputation , but they main - tain a fairly high level of performance .

		Always serious , and a master of the note of tremulous pas - sion , this poet knows how to impart his mood to others , and bear them away upon the wings of his imagination .

		This power may be illustrated by a passage from his '' Endymion '' -- the passage con - veying
Selene	PERSON	's invitation to the shepherd . ''

		Wilt thou come , And drift upon this bosom through the deep ?

		Say , wilt thou lead a life which , though less bright , Is beautiful to those of noon aweary , The rarer day of spirits exquisite ' ?

		Is it so little ocean to allure , Or rise in silence on the battle-field ; To soothe the spires and steeples of the world , Or the blue-darting pyramids ; to clothe In lovely raiment even the starkest crag ; Make the
Sahara	LOCATION	like a lily bloom , A huge and delicate flower ; to reconcile The coldest hills ; to fill the gaps of stone .

		To glaze with glory intervals of Time ; To breathe into the bones of cities dead An argent soul , reweave the passionate halls Where waves the grass , and prostrate empires old Raise into trembling immortality ? ''

		THE DIAL 76
Selene	PERSON	could have known of `` spires and steeples , '' but it is an impressive passage for all that , and con - tains the essence of poetry .

		Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	, as we have long since learned , has the power of re-stating the themes of old-world history and legend in terms that have just the touch of modern imagination needed for the renewal of theii ' freshness .

		Other examples in this volume are the poems on Orestes , on Guenevere , on the Lady
Edith	PERSON	seeking
Harold	PERSON	's body at Senlac , and the one-act Corinthian tragedy that rounds out the book .

		Left entirely to his own resources , Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	does not seem to us a verte - brate poet , but he can drape the limbs of old romance in very graceful folds .

		A second series of Mr.
Charles F. Grindrod	PERSON	's `` Songs from the Classics '' includes poems upon a number of Greek myths -- CEdipus ,
Tithonus	LOCATION	,
Hermes	ORGANIZATION	,
Iphigenia	LOCATION	, and half a dozen others .

		They are narratives rather than songs , although they con - tain an element of philosophical lyricism .

		This may be illustrated by a stanza from the Oedipus poem . ''

		Life 's book is still a wonder to our wit -- Here torn , there faded , blurred its lettered gold .

		Fainter the writing on the scroll Shows as the parchment we unroll ; And what we read is like a tale half-told , Lost the beginning , and the end unwrit . ''

		This is not much more than commonplace , and we quote it mainly as an example of a peculiar stanzaic form .

		Another form affected by the author is em - ployed in the
Iphigenia	LOCATION	poem , and is illustrated by this stanza of the maiden 's plaint . ''

		O star-crowned
Artemis	ORGANIZATION	I O purest light That burns in heaven I Whose rays divine Ever on hapless maidens shine !

		Thou who dost sail the flame-fringed sky Cloudless in thy virginity !

		-- Stoop from thy silver car that climbs the
night	TIME	, And let my grief be gladdened with thy sight ! ''

		`` In
Grasmere Vale	ORGANIZATION	, and Other Poems , '' is a small volume of verse by Mr.
James A. Mackereth	PERSON	.

		The titular poem suggests
Wordsworth	PERSON	, and yields these sympathetic stanzas of tribute and invocation . ''

		Spirit !

		of passion all unblown , And eminent o'er things that cloy , Oh , teach us something of thine own Tranquillity and joy ! ''

		Teach us our souls to guard and keep .

		To feel when onward rudely hurled Through cities , when we laugh and weep , The gladness of the world . ''

		Lead us by paths that folly flies , From random gauds that daze our youth To that simplicity that lies Upon the breast of Truth ! ''

		This is of a piece with the utterance of such latter - day Wordsworthians as
Arnold	LOCATION	and Mr.
Watson	PERSON	.

		But we find also in the new poet the Meredithian note of rapture . ''

		I will get me again to clean-smelling moorlands and fells , And gather the wisdom I squandered far off in my youth .

		And gaze in the fond tender faces where innocence dwells , And kindness and truth ; And be glad with the winds and the waters , with the birds and the trees and the flowers , And taste yet again with delight the munificent hours . ''

		I will take the glad earth to wife , Will claim her green bosom for bed , I will drink at the freshets of life .

		And beauty shall be to me bread . ''

		Thus the slow gravity of the Wordsworthian concep - tion of nature is quickened by the modern spirit of the joy of living , and that which was to the older poet a refuge becomes to the younger one an ani - mated and responsive personality .

		We even get an echo of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	in the stanzas on '' Man and the Sea , '' the last of which is this : '' to be one for the space of an hour with thee , breath of thy breath .

		Wild with the might of thy joy , and tempestuously hurled .

		One with thy wonderful waves , proud scomer of death , Queen-bride of the world I '' In fact , Mr.
Mackereth	PERSON	sometimes seems to scorn the Wordsworthian temper that he elsewhere lauds , and to repudiate the very thought of resignation .

		The following lines , addressed to the poet -LRB- generi - cally speaking -RRB- , might have been penned by
Henley	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		For thee the elevation and the calm , The aloofness that , not unallied to pain , Feeds on supernal sorrows , and drinks deep Of joys denied to mortals .

		Hence for thee The far-off acclamations of the stars , And spiritual benedictions , and soft peace ; For me the tramp , the tumult , and the cry , The curse from loud lips flung , the tyrant 's rage , The sinUe from frailty foully overborne .

		For thee the ethereal pomp and proud repose ; For me the laughter of comrades , tear and toil , The inspiring clasp of life - warm human hands , Hope , hate , strong love -- the throbbing whole of life , The blow , the sting , the rush magnificent .

		Toward that one breach , piled with God 's vehement dead , Where Death the archer waits behind the wall ! ''

		Mr.
M. Compton Mackenzie	PERSON	, in his '' Poems , '' affects the pastoral convention . ''

		Come , my
Corinna	LOCATION	, come with me and live Away in some far-hidden pastoral nook ; Stay not ,
Corinna	PERSON	, you and I could give The very scythe of Time an easeful look .

		I have a grey house set beside a stream , With casements opening on the West and
East	LOCATION	; There may you live and there forever dream Till swallows flit no more and flowers have ceased . ''

		Thus pleasantly does the volume open , inviting the reader no less than
Corinna	LOCATION	to its pages .

		The alter - nate rhyme is Mr.
Mackenzie	PERSON	's favorite mode of expression , varied now and then by terza rima , or the more complicated arrangements of the sonnet .

		We are greatly taken with the stanzas on '' Love in
November	DATE	. '' ''

		To-day the world is chill with stagnant breath , Life is a web of half-forgotten dreams .

		The year a way-worn traveller nigh to death : The winter-weary winds , the sighing streams , Are like the voices of the thin moonbeams ; The haughty sun is now no longer king .

		Love is the only constant thing , it seems ; We two who love may still remember
Spring	DATE	.

		76 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, • ' And yet how long it is , since you and I Went , hand in hand , to watch for one fair liour The river 's silver shadows sweeping by .

		For us a moment 's sadness Avas a shower , A moment 's joy the beauty of a flower .

		Ah , sweet I can you remember that lost kiss When we were lord and lady of Love 's tower , So high we seemed above the world 's abyss ? ''

		Ease and amplitude , picturesqueness and imagina - tion , are the qualities of Mr.
Mackenzie	PERSON	's exquisite verse .

		His taste is wellnigh faultless , and his feel - ing for rhythm leaves little to be desired .

		The seri - ous note prevails , but is occasionally forgotten , as in these stanzas to the memory of a favorite bulldog .

		`` Thou need ` st not any longer fear the snow , And howl despondent when the driving rain Bids thee frequent the rug and fireside-glow .

		Or draws thee hopeless to the window pane : For thee all
Winters	ORGANIZATION	have long gone before .

		And endless Springs await thee evermore . ''

		For now across an amaranthine field The spirits of bad rabbits flee thy bark , And haply some dread fox , sent unannealed Below , is chased into the outer dark , Where spectral traps and ghostly g ^ s abound .

		And through the gloom the hostile horns resound . ''

		And when we shiver by the Stygian mere Above the lamentations thi-ough the dark .

		Upon the bank remote , shall we not hear A hollow and attenuated bark ?

		Then with the hero-dogs we '11 see thee stand Alert to greet us on the murky strand . ''

		Mr.
Mackenzie	PERSON	's sonnets number hardly more than a dozen , but each is a gem .

		`` The Lilies of the Field '' shall be our selection , reluctantly leaving the beauty of the others to be inferred .

		• • Thy soul is not enchanted by the moon ; No influential comet draws thy mind To steeps intolerable where all behind Is dark , and many ruined stars are strewn .

		But thou , contented , canst enthrall the tune That haunts each wood and every singing wind ; Thou , fortunate philosopher , canst find The dreams of
Earth	LOCATION	in every drowsy noon . ''

		Match not thy soul against the seraphim ; They are no more than moths blown to and fro About the tempest of the eternal Will .

		Rest undismayed in field and forest dim And , childlike , on some morning thou shalt know The certain faith of a
March	DATE	daffodil . ''

		Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	's volumes are small but numerous , and '' The Fire Divine '' is the ninth to bear his name .

		The contents are occasional pieces for the most part , and Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	is one of the happiest of our poets when it comes to the penning of a suitable tribute to an event or a person .

		It may perhaps be said that his tendency in this species of composi - tion is to let emotion get the better of thought , or to allow the idea to become obscured in a mist of sentiment .

		But better this defect -LRB- if it be one -RRB- than the fault of viewing the subject in too dry a light .

		Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	's '' Under the Stars , '' which is a requiem for
Saint-Gaudens	PERSON	, is the most elaborate of the memorial poems now published , two of the fourteen stanzas .

		We extract '' Ye stars ; all music to the spirits eai ' I Before the imperial music-masters knelt This master of an art sublime , austere ; The very soul of music in him dwelt .

		Whose fires divine forever flame and burn . ''

		Among the brief tributary poems we may mention those inscribed to
Schurz	LOCATION	,
Aldrich	PERSON	, Mrs.
Josephine Shaw Lowell	PERSON	, and Mr.
Edward McDowell	PERSON	.

		Each of these strikes exactly the right note , and at the same time indicates how fine and high are the poet 's own ideals .

		Now and then , irregvxlar rhythms are essayed in this volume , and even poems in prose , but these experiments we can not regard as upon the level of the work done in accordance with the rules of the poetic art .

		Another of the small volumes that Mr.
Clinton Scollard	PERSON	modestly puts forth from year to year has come to hand .

		It is called '' Blank Verse Pastels , '' which indicates that it invites the severest of tests , for the poetic gift may be most certainly measured when the poet renounces the adventitious aid of rhyme .

		We can pay Mr.
Scollard	PERSON	no better tribute than to say that he seems to us more of a poet than ever in the pages of this little book .

		There are about thirty poems , few exceeding a single page in length .

		We select `` Sleep , the Almoner '' for quotation . ''

		Adowu the voids and vastnesses of night Haste thou to me , almoner of Rest !

		Come with thy fardel full of fairest dreams .

		And strew them round about me , as the
spring	DATE	Scatters the cloistral wake-robins in
May	DATE	; For I am over-weary , and would dwell Only with fantasy ; woidd droop and drowse Lulled as with lutes : would lie on blossom-beds Scented with savors of oblivion ; Down paradisal streams would glide ` neath sails Tinted like golden gonfalons ; would taste Honeys more luscious than are those that ooze From the bruised cells of Hymettean combs I All this for gift is thine , O almoner ; Then speed thee on thy pinions , snow-fall soft .

		Adown the voids and vastnesses of night ! ''

		Mr.
Scollard	PERSON	shifts from iambics to trochaics and anapaests now and then , thus givmg no little variety to the collection , despite its lack of rhyme .

		A pensive mood , expressing itself now by means of the conventional imagery , now with touches of harsh realism , is found in '' The Passing of Time , '' by Mr.

		Strange mystery of nature 's power , One dying that another should be bom , One bom to bring another death , Death after life , and life from death ,

		This verges upon platitude , and yet is not without its charm .

		In this minor key , Mr.
Thomson	PERSON	sings the phases of the day and the seasons of the chang - ing year .

		A sheaf of lyrics and somiets called '' Semitones , '' by ''
A. A. C	PERSON	, '' is marked by graceful sentiment and tender feeling .

		What could be prettier , in their way , than these simple stanzas : '' So many things I longed to say To her who is my heart 's delight , I said them over day by day , I held them in my mind at night . ''

		But , when at last the moment came That I so long had wished might come , * Before Love 's burning altar-flame My tongue was mute , my lips were dumb . ''

		Here is a poem , perhaps not more serious , of graver import . ''

		Thine ear is deaf , no errant word .

		In all the ages that are gone .

		Of all our praying hast Thou heard ; Of all our mournful cries , not one . ''

		Thy lips are dumb , no voice of Thine The endless , envious years have known ; Unto our sight has come no sign , Unto our waiting ears no tone . ''

		Thine anthem priest and pagan sing ; They gather round Thine altar-flame ; They worship , to whose worshiping No benediction ever came . ''

		They nsime with awe Thy dread abode ; Thy dwelling they decree so far That all must perish by the road In Thought that leaps from star to star . ''

		But with the `` Anthem '' comes the `` Antiphone . '' ''

		They search too far who seek Thee there .

		When Thou art near in flower and sheaf ; Thou art the answer and the prayer , Alike believer and belief . ''

		The sonnets in this collection are singularly fine , and perhaps the finest of them all is the '' Atlantis . '' ''

		Who has not seen it , high in heaven set , Cutting the skies in lines as clearly drawn As when , from
Bordighera	LOCATION	's grove at dawn ,
Far Corsica	LOCATION	is seen in silhouette !

		Vision of purple cloud and jjarapet ; Look well upon it ere the light be gone , For there thy dearest hope is held in pawn ; It is the palace of thine own regret .

		There is the land that lured thee to delight .

		Stretching away beyond those luminous spires ; Enchanted river , wood and waterfall , All vanishing upon the verge of night : Behold the home of all thy lost desires !

		Look upon
Lethe	LOCATION	flowing by the wall ! ''

		There is a ripeness about these pieces that betokens maturity of reflective thought , and the fact that one of the poems , by admission , was written more than forty years ago , shows that the distillation of a long life is contained in the slender vial now offered us .


William Morton Payne	PERSON	.

		Briefs on Ne ^ v Books .

		The memoirs of ' ^ ^ ^ man who could hold his position Monsieur
Claud e	PERSON	, a , s commissary of police and after - French detective , ^ ards as chief of police through the kaleidoscopic changes of government under
Louis Philippe	PERSON	, the short-lived second Republic , the
Second Empire	ORGANIZATION	, and the Commune must have been either very flexible or very fortunate ; at all events he was very much of a personage , and could utter his quorum pars maffna fui with something more than poetic approximation to truth .

		Such a personage was
Monsieur Claude	PERSON	, whose memoirs , published in
1881	DATE	, attracted considerable attention throughout
Europe	LOCATION	, and added much surprising material to the history of those troublous times .

		The memoirs were published in ten volumes , the first five of which bring the story down to the Siege of
Paris	LOCATION	and the Commune of
1871	DATE	.

		The contents of these five volumes have now been condensed and translated into English by Miss
Katharine Prescott Wormeley	PERSON	.

		The result is a handsome volume of over 300 pages , entitled '' Memoirs of Monsieur
Claude	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The author entered the public service in
1830	DATE	as a clerk in the Tribunal of the
Seine	LOCATION	; and his rise , aided by his tact , shrewdness , good-nature , and what he modestly calls his flair for tracking criminals , was rapid .

		At the time of
Orsini	ORGANIZATION	's murderous attempt on the Emperor 's life -LRB- 1858 -RRB-
Claude	PERSON	's promptness of action , based on private information , was rewarded by his appointment as chief of the ci'iminal and detective police .

		This position he held during the rest of Napoleon III .

		's ill-starred reign ; and he rendered signal service to the Emperor at several critical junctures .

		Of his various adventures -- worthy of Vidocq and Javert combined -- when pursuing criminals of high or low degree , he speaks with a cheery self-appreciation which is quite infectious ; and we find him in every episode occupying the centre of the stage .

		Cer - tainly there are no other heroes in these picturesque pages : '' I have seen , after the events of
June , 1848	DATE	, -- I have seen with my own eyes Prince
Louis Napoleon Bonaparte	PERSON	, at that very time aspiring to the imperial purple , appear in the box of the theatre with his face and hands dirty , to curry favor with the sovereign people in the gallery .

		I have 78 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, seen
Victor Hugo	PERSON	, standing on one foot , refuse a stool offered him from below by the malicious B ^ ranger , that he might continue the cynosure of all the eyes of the adoring crowd that acclaimed him from the gallery .

		I have seen
Rachel	PERSON	, the greatest tragedienne of modern times , who had had for her Maecenases the courtiers of the most liberal of monarchies , sing the '
Marseillaise	PERSON	' before the foot - lights , and then drive off in the carriage of the Caesars to the imperial palace . ''

		There are here related -- and probably authentically -- the details of some of the great crimes that shocked the middle of the nineteenth century ; and the detective work by which many of them were uncovered and their perpetrators captured would have done credit to the deductive processes of Mr.
Sherlock Holmes	PERSON	.

		The translation , as might be expected from
Miss Wormeley	LOCATION	, is spirited and idiomatic ; and the book is illustrated with portraits of
Napoleon III.	PERSON	, his family ,
Thiers	PERSON	, De Morny ,
Bdranger	PERSON	, and other notabilities .

		„ .

		, , , It is a curious fact that almost all of Mtlton and .

		, , .

		_ .

		, a study of the critical literature on
Milton	PERSON	s the epic form .

		poetry is of the general essay char - acter .

		The work of the poet of Puritanism has called forth comparatively little of that form of liter - ary investigation which one may call specialized studies .

		Those who have observed this lack in the literature on Milton wUl be interested in Miss
Marianna WoodhuU	PERSON	's new book `` The Epic of Paradise Lost '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		The volume contains a series of twelve essays , which embody the results of scholarly investigation as well as a good deal of original thinking .

		The author 's purpose is to establish the thesis that
Milton	PERSON	's treatment of
Adam	PERSON	's fall was demanded by the principles of the art-form he chose , and that his abandonment of the tragic form which he at first proposed to himself , grew out of his recognition of the '' inevitable '' distinction that separates the epic poem from the tragedy . ''

		Paradise Lost , '' therefore , is not to be explained on the ground that
Milton	PERSON	had an epic type of mind .

		What these principles of the epic are -- to which the poet makes reference in the ninth book of '' Paradise Lost '' -- is interpreted by
Miss Woodhull	PERSON	in her first two essays on '' What is an Epic ? ''

		and '' The Christian Epic . ''

		The distinction between the epic and the tragic theme is found to lie not only in the largeness of the epic 's scope and background , but also in its superiority as a medium for presenting such philosophical subjects as the problem of evil , free-will , and the plan of salvation for man .

		In her third essay the author presents in a scholarly and satisfactory way the parallelism of thought between the poet 's prose essay , '' A Treatise on Christian Doctrine , '' and his epic of '' Paradise Lost . ''

		The artistic insight which led him to - discard the tragic treatment of his theme , and which prevented Shakespeare from ever attempting it , was not shared in the same degree by other writers .

		This fact leads the author into an examination of four other seven - teenth century versions of man 's fall , whose inade - quacy is explained by their development upon the tragic rather than upon the epic model .

		These are Grotius 's '' Adamus Exsul , ''
Vondel	PERSON	's '' Lucifer '' and ''
Adam	PERSON	in Ballingschap , '' and
Andreini	PERSON	's '' L'Adamo . ''

		From the analyses given of these plays , the contention is well sustained that tragedy as such is too concrete , too limited in background and conception , for the successfid handling of an abstract theme like that of the origin of evil on the earth .

		In the tenth essay a study is made of epical pas - sages in Tasso 's '' Jerusalem Delivered , ''
Marino	PERSON	's '' Sospetto d' Herode , '' and in certain dramas of
Beaumont	LOCATION	and
Fletcher	PERSON	, to show that these '' were of more direct aid to Milton '' than were those tragedies which are commonly supposed to have influenced him .

		In the twelfth essay , which closes the volume .

		Miss
Woodhull	PERSON	presents the results of her investigation of the epical source of
Milton	LOCATION	's lyrics and the Miltonic influence on the lyric work of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	, and
Byron	PERSON	.

		A
Scotchman	PERSON	's ^ he fate of
Mary Stuart	PERSON	is a subject special plea for of perennial interest .

		Tragedy and
Mary Stuart	PERSON	.

		mystery have always appealed to the nature of man , and
Mary	PERSON	's career was both tragic and mysterious .

		Just to what extent she was respon - sible for the criminal plottings that have darkened her fame , is a much debated question .

		Especially is it difficult to determine how far she was involved in the plots against the life of the English queen .

		The most recent work dealing with this problem is a volume by Mr.
Samuel Cowan	PERSON	entitled '' The Last Days of
Mary Stuart	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The author is a resident of historic
Perth	LOCATION	, and has devoted a large part of his time and energies to the study of Scottish history in the sixteenth century .

		The work before us is , however , not so much a history as a lawyer 's brief ; and the brief is remarkable neither for lucid - ity nor for strength .

		Mr.
Cowan	PERSON	assumes that the documents used in convicting
Mary	PERSON	have been proved to be forgeries ; there remains , therefore , nothing but the task of explaining certain suspicious circumstances and utterances that have been used against
Mary	PERSON	, and this he has accomplished to his own evident satisfaction .

		He is equally facile in explaining the motives of the queen 's enemies .

		Elizabeth hated
Mary	PERSON	because she '' was the nearest heir to the crown of
England	LOCATION	, and greatly her superior in every human accomplishment . ''


Burleigh	PERSON	`` compromised himself with a scheme for the de - struction of a defenseless and innocent woman for no other reason than to please Elizabeth . ''

		Walsing - ham was the greatest villain of all ; he executed
Babington	PERSON	and his eleven confederates , not for plotting in favor of
Mary	ORGANIZATION	or against
Elizabeth	PERSON	, but because they were in position to prove
Mary	PERSON	's in - nocence .

		To the discussion of the supposed for - geries , Mr.
Cowan	PERSON	has added very little ; he shows clearly how it was possible to intercept and inter - polate
Mary	PERSON	's correspondence , and indicates what changes are thought to have been made , but fails to produce a convincing argument .

		The matter
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 79 remains where it was left by such sympathetic his - torians as Dr.
Lingard	PERSON	and Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	, -- a charge supported by certain suspicious circumstances , but not yet proved .

		The value of Mr.
Cowan	PERSON	's history lies in the documentary materials that he has introduced ; more than half of the volume is given over to letters , journals , and proclamations .

		Of these , the most important is the journal of
Burgoyne	PERSON	, who was
Mary	PERSON	's physician ; this records from day to day the events that occurred from
August 11 , 1586	DATE	, to
February 8 , 1587	DATE	, the day of the execution .

		In publishing this narrative the author has done a real service to history .

		Some of the letters included are also of great interest .

		Pariiamentarv M. Hanotaux has suggested the crit - baltles and .

		i • i i , r > i debates of icism or his third volume on '' Con - modern
France	LOCATION	, temporary
France	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- in the words with which he opens his second chapter : ''
M. Thiers	PERSON	used to say , ' We have too much politics in this country . '

		There is always a fear lest history should fall into the same error , and allow itself to be invaded by the facile abundance of parliamentary papers . ''

		With the exception of half a chapter on the war-scare of
1875	DATE	, the volume is filled with accounts of the parliamentary battles which resulted in the passage of the constitutional laws , and with the skirmishes in the new senate and chamber of deputies which led to the
Sixteenth of May	ORGANIZATION	.

		This statement is not intended as a reflection of the sort which would condemn the work as tedious or unin - structive ; such a reflection would be unjust .

		Indeed , there can be few pages of French history more inter - esting than the remarkably sympathetic narrative which M. Hanotaux has written of the way in which the
National Assembly	ORGANIZATION	, a monarchical body , was forced , partly by public opinion skilfully interpreted by such men as
Laboulaye	PERSON	and
Wallon	LOCATION	, and partly by the sheer impossibility of doing anything else , to create the constitution of the
Third Republic	ORGANIZATION	.

		The account of the interposition , at successive crises of discussion , of the gentle but clear-minded
M. Wallon	PERSON	, with a formula of action which accom - plished indirectly what the monarchist majority could not be persuaded to do more frankly , brings every element of an extremely complex situation before the reader .

		And yet , taking the volume as a whole , M. Hanotaux has imposed too serious a burden upon the reader 's powers of sustained atten - tion .

		This difficulty would have been obviated had he not descended into minute details in dealing with less critical debates .

		Such full information upon the attitude of persons of secondary importance is to be looked for , rather , in a volume of personal memoirs .

		It would have been a relief to the attention , also , if more information had been given in regard to other phases of the history of these three years between
1874	DATE	and
1877	DATE	.

		The story of the war-scare serves the purpose in a measure , and is , besides , a valuable analysis of all the evidence in the case .

		In reference to this affair , one can not escape the feeling that although there may have been some real danger of a German attack , the fears of
France	LOCATION	were excessive , and that the international '' scare '' was heightened by the French minister Decazes in order to place Ger - many , and particularly the diplomacy of
Bismarck	LOCATION	, at a moral disadvantage .

		The history and ^ ^ ^ .

		^ ^ Ids of scientific investigation distribution of Combine fact and hypothesis to the animal life .

		degree that is necessitated in a study of the geographical distribution of animals .

		The facts are most diverse , coming as they do from vari - ous departments of knowledge ; and in each field , moreover , critical discernment of significant data and of the accuracy of sources is essential .

		In the field of systematic zoology and botany , the investigator must have a wide knowledge of range of distribution of many species over large areas and a keen appre - ciation of specific differences and relationships .

		He must not only have this familiar acquaintance with the living fauna and flora , but he must also have an equally wide grasp on the more fragmentary data from the fossil world , both of the region under investigation and of adjacent and perhaps even of far distant countries .

		To this must be added a critical and constructive knowledge of the geological evidence of the changes in the coast-lines and boun - daries of continents and islands in ages past , and probable climatic conditions which have accompanied those elevations and depressions of the earth 's crust .

		It is a high grade of constructive imagination that is required to draw from this huge mass of details , from these diverse and often imperfect and even conflicting data a logical , defensible , and consistent presentation of the causes which underlie the dis - tribution of animals and plants as they exist to-day upon the globe , or even in a limited part of it , as , for example , in
Europe	LOCATION	or the British Isles .

		It is for these reasons -- lack of data , and primarily the need of the rare combination of wide knowledge and con - structive imagination , -- that the work of
Wallace	PERSON	has stood for so many years with so few rivals in this field of biology .

		Dr.
Scharff	PERSON	's `` European Animals , their Geological History and Geographical Distribution '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- is noteworthy for the wide range of data drawn from these various fields and for a logical and consistent presentation of the salient facts .

		No treatise on the European fauna approaches it in the completeness and variety of its illustrative material , or compares with it in the grasp of the subject in its many-sided aspects .

		The combination of a figure of the animal or plant and a map of its distribution , which the author uses frequently , not only saves space but is very effective .

		The book has a full bibliography and a good index .

		A study in mental patholooy '' No doubt the subject is a morbid one , '' confesses Mr.
Arthur Christo	PERSON	- pher
Benson	PERSON	in his preface to '' The Altar Fire '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , '' because the book deliber - ately gives a picture of a diseased spirit .

		But a pathological treatise , dealing with cancer or paraly - sis , is not necessarily morbid , though it may be 80 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, studied in a morbid mood . ''

		And as to the benevo - lent purpose of this picture of a suffering soul : '' There are multitudes of people in like case ; the very confession of the fact may help others to endure , because one of the darkest miseries of suffering is the horrible sense of isolation that it brings . ''

		The hero , and in truth the rather unheroic hero , of Mr.
Benson	PERSON	's quiet tale , is a written-out novelist -LRB- we are not told his name -RRB- in the pages of whose diary , from Sep - tember ,
1888	DATE	, to
October , 1891	DATE	, we have the record of his deepening gloom and his final calm submission to the divine will .

		The consciousness that creative power is no longer his , that the fire from heaven will nevermore descend upon him , is of course extremely painful to the diarist , and is not very cheerful in its effect on the reader .

		But as there are moods in which one finds
Obermann	PERSON	a congenial spirit , so there are states of mind in which '' The Altar Fire '' may be read with a kind of melancholy pleasure .

		The book teaches , among other things , the insuffi - ciency of art when the evil days overtake one .

		It also is full of details autobiographically interesting to the Benson-lover .

		Here , as in his other works , the author evidently draws on the accumulated treasure of well-filled note-books ; and as he writes with a considerable experience of successful author - ship to look back upon , he is able to touch , lightly and in passing , on some of the annoyances and vani - ties that attend this kind of popularity .

		The more serious ills that befall his patient hero , in the way of bereavement and pecuniary loss , are presumably more purely fictitious than the mental and moral tribulations he is made to undergo .

		The aching sense of literai ' y barrenness , after a period of fertile productivity , may very well be one with which Mr.
Benson	PERSON	is not unfamiliar .

		Possibly there are some pages of the book that attest this more unmistakably than the author had intended .

		But as a whole the volume has the wonted cliarm of its writer 's quietly reflective and genially discui ` sive manner .

		An astronorner ' o ^ ^ ' -

		best American popularizers of astron - omy , lias been sojourning in Fi-ance , and has just produced a book on the Moon -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- which bears decided marks of French influence .

		The author frankly states in the preface that he has admired Fontenelle 's '' Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds . ''

		As one reads , he is reminded also of the style of Flammarion .

		Mr.
Serviss	PERSON	represents himself as talking with a lady of refinement and leisure , who lives by a beautiful private park from which tliere is a fine view of the sky .

		On the first '' conversation '' evening , the fuU moon attracts the lady 's attention , and gives rise to various questions and explanations , the interest of which is heightened by a timely eclipse .

		The series of conversations about our nocturnal luminary is illustrated by fine photographs of its various phases ; and afterwards large scale photographs of certain striking limar formations are explained by the teacher to his fair pupil .

		Her interest is especially aroused by the question of possible intelligent life , in the past or at present , on our satellite : and though her ardor in this respect is continually checked by her instructor , she determines to buy a small tele - scope and hunt for evidence of the existence of present-day lunarians .

		While feminine character - istics are very obstrusive in tlie conversations , the reader may judiciously skip these , and find a wealth of accurate descriptive matter concerning the promi - nent featm ` es of the lunar landscape .

		The twenty - six excellent full-page plates of the moon are made from photographs taken at the
Yerkes Observatory	ORGANIZATION	.

		A good index enables one to find the description of any particular lunar feature .

		Mr.
Morgan	PERSON	has made a careful study of
Patrick Heniy	PERSON	, and has written with an enthusiasm that would perhaps communicate itself more strongly to the reader but for the too evident purpose to be sprightly and vivid ; the author also brings in many details of persons and events that distract attention from the main current of the nar - rative .

		Perhaps this discursiveness is due to the previous literary experience of the author as a writer of historical fiction .

		However , the book is one of interest and value as presenting anew a full-length portrait of one of our national heroes , and it should be widely read .

		Of especial interest are the chap - ters on

Sheffield	ORGANIZATION	, and gives full accounts of the periods and the designs most prized by connoisseurs .

		An enthusiastic collector him - self , he avoids the dry , statistical tone that discourages the beginner , and he possesses a happy faculty -- some - what rare in students of the antique -- of saying clearly and exactly what he means .

		An accoimt of the career of an old-time
Boston	LOCATION	merchant-philanthropist , not one of the aristocratic - conservative type , but a man of democratic spirit , an aboUtionist , a friend and supporter of
John Brown	PERSON	, is given in '' The Life and
Public Services	ORGANIZATION	of George Luther Steams '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , by his son ,
Frank Preston Stearns	PERSON	.

		The personahty of the subject is interesting , and there are in the book glimpses of notable public men , -- Sumner ,
Stanton	PERSON	, Governor
Andrew	PERSON	, and others .

		But the main value of the work lies in its presentation of two leading interests in the life of Mr.
Stearns	PERSON	, -- his sup - port of
John Brown	PERSON	throughout his
Kansas	LOCATION	career , which was constant and mvaluable to the carrying out of the
New England	LOCATION	plans , and his services in recruiting negroes for the
Union	ORGANIZATION	armies .

		The account of these activities is full and of permanent value .

		The tone of the book is belligerent where differences of opinion and method are discussed , and many violent prejudices make them - selves manifest .

		These features detract from the reader 's pleasure , but they are themselves , as it were , foot-notes to the history of the time .

		Notes .

Feb. 1,1908	DATE	.

		TO APPEAR
FEBRUARY 8	DATE	A New Novel by WILLIAM De MORGAN , Author of ALIGE-FOR-SHORT SOMEHOW GOOD After years of separation from his wife , the hero , during a complete suspension of memory and loss of identity , accidentally finds shelter in her home .

		This situation seems very simple , but the developments are far from simple , and form a story of complicated motives and experiences which holds the reader closely .

		An almost grown-up daughter , ignorant of the situation , heightens the tension of the plot , and furnishes her share of two charming stories of young love .

		That this third volume by Mr.
De Morgan	PERSON	appears within less than a year and a half of his first , may arouse anxiety on the part of his admirers lest he be overproducing .

		But before he published his first novel , he had several completely written , and several others carefully sketched out .

		So far from '' Somehow Good '' being diluted work , it is , in the unanimous opinion of the publishers ' readers , an advance upon anything of Mr.
De Morgan	PERSON	's yet published .

		BRIEFER MENTION Ill NOTES 112 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 113 THE APPRECIA TIONOF LITERATURE .

		A great deal of printed matter , intended for the admonition and guidance of young people , is put forth every year upon the subject of books and reading .

		Sometimes it takes the futile form of an annotated list or course of study ; sometimes it consists of mere rhetorical vaporing ; occasionally it combines instruction with counsel in a really helpful and inspiring way .

		But this aim is not to be reached -LRB- either by pretentious twaddle or by rigorous prescription , for the former is rarely imposing and the latter is rarely practical .

		The fundamental difficulty of the problem is to be met only by a clear recognition of the fact that literary appreciation is an indi - vidual concern , and that , while standards of taste undoubtedly exist and their acquisition should be the ultimate goal of every reader , they are attained to by many paths , and it would be a wise man indeed who should know how to mark out the course best fitted for another 's steps .

		The best of all agencies for the inculcation of a sound literary taste is the home library , well stocked with books new and old -LRB- especially old -RRB- , accessible to the child from the days of his early toddlings , and offering him its unaffected wel - come .

		But the old-fashioned home library , in the sense in which we read of it in the literature of memoir and autobiography , hardly exists to-day ; and even in families where it is found , the tranquil delights which it offers to the young people of the household are forced into too sharp a competition with the exciting allurements of the outside world .

		These distractions , for the most part trivial if not imwholesome , enlist the energies that might easily have been turned into bookish channels , and the precious years of childhood -- the only years in which the best foundations of the intellectual life may be laid -- are frittered away in external frivolities , sacri - ficed to the mischievous sentiment which permits children to run wild because they enjoy it , and because their parents like to see them happy .

		The influence of the home library failing us , we must look to the agencies of the public library and the school to unfold for our young people the joys of reading , which are also much more than present joys , since they have the lasting effect of enlarging the contacted life of the 92 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, individual until it coincides with the sphere of all human experience .

		Of these two agencies , we are bound to say that the public library has risen more completely than the school to the true conception of their common task .

		The reason is simple enough .

		The library , with its enlight - ened modern methods and the realization of its educational function , treats the young reader as an individual ; the school , shackled by system , treats him as a member of a regiment .

		And this makes aU the difference between measur - able success and certain failure .

		Prescribed books and courses and methods have their uses in some departments of educational activity , but their effect is absolutely pernicious when they are applied to literature as a school subject .

		And yet this obvious truth seems to make no impres - sion upon the type of mind that somehow con - trives to exercise educational authority in our schools , and the sort of teaching that makes literature hateful to young minds remains the only sort to receive the sanction of our peda - gogical pundits .

		If only such a book as that recently pub - lished by Professor Woodberry on '' The Appre - ciation of Literature '' were taken to heart by the framers of our educational programmes , there would quickly be an end of all teaching of the subject according to schedule , with marks and examinations as final causes .

		The author says : '' Without setting limits to study of whatever sort , for all modes of study have possible uses , it is to be laid down in general that all study of literature in the way of preparation to grasp and understand , whether it be linguistic , historical , or aesthetic , exists to be forgotten and laid off as soon as it is completed ; its end is to with - draw one by one the veils , and leave the reader alone with the spirit of the book , which then speaks to him face to face . ''

		This is absolutely true ; and yet , in spite of it , our teachers continue to treat the scaffolding as if it were the building itself , and offer to eager young minds the sawdust of information as if it were the food for which the spirit craves .

		The most contracted of minds may undoubt - edly be enlarged by the mere process of accre - tion , but this is not organic growth .

		Rather does it stifle growth by encasing the developing faculties within a hard shell of fact , excluding the light and air they most need .

		If we are to strengthen the feeling for literature in the imma - ture mind , we must first of all realize that study is only subsidiary to our purpose , that our real aim is to take the individual mind as we find it , selecting our means with reference to the par - ticular stage of development it may have reached , appealing to such sympathies and imaginative resources as it already exhibits , and at the same time slightly anticipating the emergence of powers now latent , but on the point of becoming active .

		For , as our author further says , every reader , young or old , '' is at last thrown fairly back upon his own experience , or the kind and quality of the life he has lived , for his apprecia - tion of literature .

		... If the light is not in him , he can not see . ''

		The fundamental lesson of all this is that , in dealing with the child , we must keep pretty close to the child 's level . ''

		The natural introduction to literature for the very young is by means of that universal sort which is selected from all ages and requires no study , such as the stories of Scripture , short legendary tales of history , beast and bird fables , fairy tales and the like .

		They have , besides their intelligibility , the advantage of accustoming the mind to a make-believe world , natural to childish fancy , and so laying the foundation for that principle of convention which is fundamental in art and indispensable in its practice , and also of making the contemplation of imaginary experience habitual so that there is no shock between it and truth . ''

		Even '' nature-faking '' gets a good word from Professor Woodberry . ''

		The transposition by which human experience is placed in the bird and beast world is a literary fiction ; as an element in early education it helps to give that plas - ticity to the world of fact which is essential to the artistic interpretation of life and the imaginary habit of mind . ''

		If a few of these ideas were once fairly lodged in the pedagogical cranium , we should witness an amazing reform in educational methods , and we might save for other objects the sympathies we now have to lavish upon hapless boys and girls engaged in studying -LRB- in the name of liter - ature ! -RRB-

		such productions as
Addison	PERSON	's Essays , and
Burke	PERSON	on Conciliation , and
Defoe	PERSON	on the
London Plague	LOCATION	.

		We have taken these illustrative texts from Professor
Woodberry	PERSON	's opening chapter on '' First Principles . ''

		We might find others no less suggestive in the succeeding chapters , which discuss the appreciation of the several literary species -- of lyrical , narrative , and domestic poetry , of the novel , the history , and the essay .

		The whole treatment is so admirable and so vital , so closely in touch with the essentials of the sub - ject , that we wish for it the widest possible in - fluence .

		And it would be difiicult to sum up the entire matter with more truth and effective eloquence than we find in the closing sentences of the book .

		`` Study has great deadening power over life ; and when the reader finds this deadening influence in his pursuit of literature , when personahty begins to fade from the page , and the abstract , the parasitical , the fact
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 93 encroach , and literature becomes rather a form of know - ledge than of life , then he is losing the proper good of literature ; and he should seek again in himself and his authors the vitality of a personal touch , the connection of life , the power of human truth .

		The great thing is to remain alive in one 's reading , and nowhere should the principle of life be more sacredly guarded than in its most immortal presence -- imaginative literature and those other forms that take their color from its himian methods . ''

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		PROOF-8HEET MARGINALIA offer , as a rule , even less of literary attraction than does the dictionary ; but some of De Quincey 's corrections of proof -LRB- and of printer -RRB- have a certain vituperative emphasis and vigor that make them lively reading .

		A few of his vehement and pithy remarks , culled from his proof-sheets , have lately found their way into print and are worth passing along .

		The little opium-eater was emphatically of the genus irritabile , put into a passion by a misspelt word or a mis - placed comma , and making life miserable for his printers .

		The word '' aerial '' set up with initial diphthong called forth the following objurgatory apostrophe : '' Oh , thou unknown compositor , dost thou mean to drive me to an early grave , dost thou not know that aerial was a word of four syllables in the times of the Greeks and the Romans , was then , is now , and ever shall be , world with - out end .

		Amen ! ''

		In another instance , correcting the omission of a letter , the incensed author told the com - positor , in language far from polite , that the missing letter was a necessary part of the word , and would remain so '' when you are damned , or hanged for for - gery . ''

		Proof-correctors are of many and unaccount - able kinds .


Leslie Stephen	PERSON	groaned over the frequent and outrageous misprints in his books , but declared him - self unable to hold his mind down to the proof-reader 's level .

		Evidently he should have employed a less lofty - minded person to act for him .


Walter Pater	PERSON	, on the other hand , who certainly lived on no low plane , was never weary of correcting and re-correcting his proof - sheets ; in fact , he used to order a preliminary printing , at his own expense , solely for the purpose of seeing what corrections the types suggested that the manuscript did not .

		A somewhat similar passion on
Balzac	ORGANIZATION	's part is known to aU .

		, , , The poet 's beatific vision can induce oblivion of pelting rain , clinging mud , deafening roar of city streets , and all the nerve-racking accompaniments of urban existence .

		Witness this remembrance of the late
Francis Thompson	PERSON	-LRB- already regretfully mentioned by us as one whose early promise had inspired hopes of memorable achievement still to come -RRB- from the pen of Mr.
C. Lewis	PERSON	Hind : '' The roads were ankle-deep in slush ; a thin , icy rain was falling ; the yellow fog enwrapped the pedes - trians squelching down the lane ; and , going through them in an arrow-path , I saw
Francis Thompson	PERSON	, wet and mud-spattered .

		But he was not unhappy .

		What is a day of unpleasant weather to one who lives in eternity ?

		His lips were moving , his head was raised , his eyes were himiid with emotion ; for above the roof of the
Chancery Lane Safe Deposit Company	ORGANIZATION	, in the murk of the fog , he saw beatific visions . ''

		But we are all human , and one touch of nature makes the whole world kin ; therefore we must proceed a little further with these reminiscences .

		Thompson had reviewed
Henley	PERSON	's '' Collected Poems , '' and
Henley	PERSON	had asked Mr.
Hind	PERSON	to bring the younger poet to see him . ''

		That was a memorable afternoon , but it did not begin auspi - ciously .


Thompson	PERSON	was an hour late in calling for me at the office ; when we reached Muswell Hill railway station he complained of himger , ate a vast quantity of cold beef , aud then alarmed me by gliding into a trance .

		Suddenly he became rigid , his body swayed , and a film came over his eyes .

		It seemed as if his soul had flitted temporarily from his body . ''

		Instead of a trance , was it not rather an attack of acute indigestion , or stomach - ache , after all that cold beef ?

		But whatever the seizure , it passed off , and the two poets held high converse together .

		, .

		, The claims of Greek literature will not be silenced by any Harrovian head-master 's pronounce - ment , such as that recently uttered .

		Educational waste may be , and ought to be , diminished by ceasing to impose the reading of ^ schylus on a youth who can - not even make anything out of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		Individ - ual aptitudes are receiving , in these days of rapidly multiplying `` electives , '' more careful attention ; but that the human mind is ever likely to undergo such a change as to render it incapable of reaping profit from the study of the Greek and Latin languages and litera - tures , is almost imthinkable .

		So long as man has a wit to be sharpened , an intelligence to be broadened , a power of self-utterance to be developed , the most per - fect medium of literary expression , as displayed in the masterpieces of Greek history and philosophy , drama and oratory , should be to him an educational instrument and an intellectual solace .

		That the ancient classics should ever again dominate the school curriculum , as they once did , is not to be expected any more than that this modern life of multifarious interests and activities should yield to a return of mediaeval narrowness of outlook and slowness of movement .

		It is unnatural for the present-day American to regard facility in speaking and writing Latin as the one indispensable mark of a gentleman and scholar , just as it is unnatural for the twentieth-century Dutchman to look upon tulip-culture as the most important and most delightful of human occupations .

		... An `` authoritative '' life of
Henry Irving	PERSON	, following with due deliberation after the two somewhat precipitate biographies by Mr.
Bram Stoker	PERSON	and Mr.
Percy Fitzgerald	PERSON	, is promised by Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The satisfactory and final account of
Irving	PERSON	and his art this journal has already declared to be among the books still to be desired , and it gives us pleasure to quote the publisher 's announcement : '' We beg to inform you that the authoritative
Life of Henry Irving	ORGANIZATION	is in preparation , and will be published by us next autumn .

		The biography is being written by Mr.
Austin Brereton	PERSON	, an old and intimate personal friend of the great actor , who was supplied with much valuable and unique material for the work by Sir
Henry Irving	PERSON	him - self .

		Sir
Henry	PERSON	's sons , Mr.
H. B. Irving	PERSON	and Mr.
Laurence Irving	PERSON	, who are the executors under their father 's will , have given their cordial consent to Mr.
Brereton	PERSON	's undertaking , and have supplied him for the purpose of this book with all the records and other documents relating to their father which they possess .

		As this will be the authorized biography of
Henry Irving	PERSON	, it is desirous that it should be as comprehensive as possible , and all owners of letters of public interest 94 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, in regard to the subject , whether written by the deceased actor or others , are requested to be kind enough to send them for perusal -- and , if considered desirable , pub - lication -- to Mr.

		• • • Uniformity in catalogue cards and catalogu - ing CODES is being rapidly effected by the increasing use of the cards printed and sold by the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the past year 952 subscribers , chiefly public libraries , were supplied -- an increase of 188 over the preceding year .

		The whole amount paid by these 952 institutions for cards purchased during the twelve months was
$ 19,222	MONEY	; and as the saving effected through the use of these cards is estimated at from four to seven times their cost , the cataloguing bureau at
Washington	LOCATION	would appear to set free from
$ 76,000	MONEY	to
$ 134,000	MONEY	annually for the purchase of library books and the supplying of other important library needs .

		The total number of titles now covered by these cards is 280,000 , of which 55,000 represent the past year 's additions .

		It is pleas - ant to think how much pen-scratching , or type-writer thumping , is saved to these 952 libraries throughout the land .

		How many cases of writer 's cramp may have been thus prevented , and how much human energy and intelligence released for less grinding and macliine-like toil than this dreary and never-ending manufacture of author-cards , title-cards , subject-cards , cross-reference - cards , and so on , through all the subordinate varieties !

		In a mild degree , it is as if the problem of pain had been rendered a little less heart-breaking by the substi - tution -LRB- let us say -RRB- of one central toothache for fifty thousand separate and independent toothaches .

		• • • A prize competition of poets is '' on '' in
England	LOCATION	.

		A great tobacco-house , recognizing that music hath charms to soothe the smoker 's breast , has offered a prize for the best lay that shall sing the praises of the firm 's nicotine products .

		And such a prize ! ''

		A freehold furnished coimtry house , with pony and trap , stabling , bath , electric light , and # 2 per week pension for life . ''

		Who would not be a rhymester , with such a reward of merit before his eyes !


Edward FitzGerald	PERSON	used to aver that everyone could , once at least in a lifetime , turn out a copy of `` occasional '' verses ; and surely here is an occasion well worth rising to -- worth # 104 per annum , and house and stable , bath and pony and electric light , besides .

		But to compete with any chance of success one ought , in the poetic fitness of things , to be an impas - sioned smoker and write imder the immediate influence of the great tobacco firm 's choicest brand of
Havana	LOCATION	cigars ; and as not all of lis are smokers -LRB- far less chewers or snuff-takers -RRB- we can not , alas , all hope to win the '' two pound per '' and accompanying etceteras .

		But we could n't all hope to win , anyway ; so there is still con - solation for our disappointment .

		• • `` A quaintly interesting annual , but of a very different quaintness from that of our grandparents ' annuals -- those prim posy-beds of sentimental poetry • that used to grace the marble-topped drawing-room table -- makes its new year 's appearance from historic old
Marblehead	LOCATION	, in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	.

		Like the blessings of fresh air and pure water and genial sunshine , it is dispensed without money and without price .

		The
Marblehead	LOCATION	business man who issues this welcome annual -- it is , in plain words , a seed catalogue -- will never be tempted to burn his books , because he has no books to burn , so far as may be judged from his frank account of his business methods .

		These methods have built up a large and prosperous trade , which now in his eightieth year the head of the house hands over to the care of his son , '' who has served an apprenticeship of half a century to the calling . ''

		Assured that the younger man will continue the older 's poUcy of dealing with others as he would have them deal with him , the father thus concludes his preface to his patrons : '' Should mankind , as individuals or nations , but accept this as a rule of life , we should need no Hague confer - ences , and
State	ORGANIZATION	prisons might be turned into brick quarries .

		In these days , when so many of our fellow - men in other callings are overweighed with heavy busi - ness responsibilities , my brother farmers , we make up that fortunate class which , affiliating with neither poverty nor riches , can enjoy a freedom controlled by no man , and the wholesome pleasure which crowns the Simple Life . ''

		Verily , there are tongues in trees , books in the running brooks , and sermons in seed catalogues .

		• • • The transplanting of words , and their frequent vigorous growth in the new soU long after the parent stock has withered away , is a subject of unfailing interest to dabblers in philology .

		One who is not a dabbler , however ,
Colonel T. W. Higginson	PERSON	, contributes to a current newspaper some interesting observations on `` The Migration of Words , '' and incidentally shows what a surprising amount of supposed American slang is to be found in the '' Diary and Letters '' of
Madame d' Arblay	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
Frances Burney	PERSON	-RRB- , the admired author of '' Evelina '' and ''
Cecilia	PERSON	. ''

		In the memoirs above named -- published in
1842	DATE	, twelve years earlier than the date given by Mr.
Higginson	PERSON	-- appear such modern terms and phrases as '' cute , '' '' hang it , '' '' downed , '' '' trembled a few , '' '' snigger , '' '' a most elegant dessert , '' '' a high treat , '' and many others .

		In
Francis Grose	PERSON	's '' Provincial Glossary '' -LRB- 1814 -RRB- occur still more numerous and surprising '' Americanisms . ''

		Colonel
Higginson	PERSON	recalls the quaint dialect of old
Marblehead	LOCATION	, and says that there only on our coast could be heard the uncouth word '' gawming '' -LRB- awkward , lubberly -RRB- which
Grose	PERSON	's dictionary contams as a North-of-England term .

		From it , we conjecture , may have come the form '' gawmed '' -LRB- or '' gormed '' -RRB- , heard in rural speech ; as `` yougormed idiot ! ''

		This migration of words is ever in progress , and will always furnish a pleasant subject of study to the philologically curious .

		• • • A HANDBOOK TO THE PUBLIC DOCUMENTS OF

1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 95 COMMUNICA TIONS .

		THE OLD-FASHIONED LIBRARIAN .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		The complaint voiced by Mr.
Thomas H. Briggs	PERSON	in the last nimiber of
The Dial	ORGANIZATION	, that it is not possible to get librarians who love books and their contents , is one that has been frequentlj ' made of late , and it must be admitted , even by librarians themselves , that it is not wdthont some foundation in fact .

		It is true that many , perhaps most , of the men and women employed in libra - ries are not book-lovers in the old-fashioned way which Mr.
Briggs	PERSON	thinks desirable .

		Far too many , even of those who are at the head of libraries , have not a real love of books , and their knowledge of them is sometimes not much more than that gained in an ordinary college education .

		It mvist even be confessed that the graduates of library schools do not always have that wide and va - ried knowledge of the contents of books that the public -LRB- and library trustees -RRB- are justified in desiring , if not in demanding .

		Having admitted this , if your space permits , I wish to pouit out one or two facts that account for the con - dition in which Mr.
Briggs	PERSON	finds himself .

		In passing , however , one might question whether the old-fashioned book-loving librarian was as efficient as a few critics of present-day librarians would like us to believe .

		Tradi - tion tells us that his love of books was so great that he wanted all the books to stay in the library all the time .

		A worn-out book was an unfamiliar object to his eyes .

		Both his lack of system and iron-clad rules tended to pre - vent those who would really be most benefitted by books from ever obtainuig them .

		The motto of the
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	, '' The best reading for the largest number at the least cost , '' would not have appealed to him .

		He was a book-lover , but he was not a lover of humanity .

		The public had to seek him ; he never sought the public .

		Whatever the faults of the modern librarian may be , it must be admitted that he has plenty of mis - sionary spirit which leads him to go out into the high - ways and byways , and to try to make the library an influence for good in the life of his community .

		And this missionary spirit will be foimd most firmly im - planted in those who have graduated from library schools .

		For I firmly believe , that , in addition to the technical training which students receive , they also be - come thoroughly imbued with the idea that the public library is an educational force in the community , and that it is their duty to augment its efficiency and to bring an ever-increasing number of persons within the circle of its influence .

		The principal reason , I believe , for Mr.
Briggs	PERSON	's failure to find book-loving librarians is that there is not a sufficient number of real book-lovers such as he wants , to supply even approximately the demand for library workers .

		As a librarian myself , I am thrown in contact more or less with many kinds of users of the library .

		There are professional men who use the library in their work .

		There are the club women who prepare essays and do prescribed reading .

		There are the workingmen who use the technical books to increase their knowledge of their trade .

		There are the teachers , and there are the coimtless thousands of novel readers .

		Among all those who use the library more or less constantly , I have found in the
last three years	DATE	not over five who would fulfill Mr.
Briggs	PERSON	's ideal -LRB- and mine -RRB- .

		Not over five have revealed in any way whatsoever that they use the library other than for reference or purely recreation - ary purposes .

		This experience , and the experience of the years before I was at the head of a library , or even before I was interested in library work at all , lead me to believe that the real book-lover is an exceedingly scarce person .

		If all the real book-lovers were engaged in library work , there would still be room for many others , and Mr.
Briggs	PERSON	, as well as other library trustees , would have to employ many who have little more than a library school training and a missionary spirit to recommend them .

		LIBRARY CIRCULATION IN
ENGLAND AND AMERICA	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		I have just seen a paragraph in your
January	DATE	issue , regarding the Public Libraries of this coxmtry , based upon some figures taken from my '' Manual of Library Economy . ''

		There is one mistake which I think ought to be corrected , and that is the statement that `` the average number of books drawn annually by each bor - rower is 3 '' This quotation refers to the number of volumes stocked per borrower : the number of books read annually is 30 per borrower .

		I may state that a more recent investigation shows that in the Municipal Libraries of the
United Kingdom	LOCATION	no fewer than 60,000,000 volumes are annually circulated for home reading , and that over 11,000,000 books are issued for reference use , without counting the enormous number of consultations at the open shelves of such Libraries .

		There is just one important point which , to a very great extent , I think , must be held to qualify any com - parisons which are made between the Library work of the
United States	LOCATION	and the
United Kingdom	LOCATION	.

		It must always be remembered that British Public Libraries labour under the serious disadvantage of a Rate limita - tion , which brings the average income for all purposes down to about one-third of the average income enjoyed by American Libraries .

		For example , the
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	has an income of # 68,000 , against # 26,410 which
Manchester	ORGANIZATION	expends for all purposes .

		The annual circulation from
Boston	LOCATION	is 1,461,000 volumes issued from the
Central Library	ORGANIZATION	, 10 branches , 23 deliv - ery stations , etc. , while at Manchester the annual cir - culation is 1,957,475 volumes issued from 19 branches and delivery stations .

		I think there is no doubt that the Library systems of both countries , imder varying conditions , are doing splendid work , and that the
Public Library	ORGANIZATION	in any town would be one of the last of the municipal services which the inhabitants would care to see aboUshed .

		The True Story op a Strange Boyhood .

		* It was unnecessary for the author of '' Father and Son '' to assure the reader in his preface that his narrative was not fiction in disguise , but a true history faithfully recorded .

		Its reality speaks in every line of the simple , restrained , unrhetorical setting forth of the anonymous writer 's rigorous upbringing under the severe rule of a religiously and morally strict father and mother , the sole object of whose parental care it was his lot to be .

		The rigors of
John Stuart Mill	PERSON	's training at the hands of his father almost take on a sybaritic softness when compared with the austerities of the Calvinistic household in which the boyhood of this other paternally educated child was passed .

		As the author himself says , the peculiar value of the book is in its being '' a record of educa - tional and religious conditions which , having passed away , will never return . ''

		It is '' the diagnosis of a ` dying Puritanism , '' and as such it will gain in curious interest , especially to the student of religious history , as time passes .

		Let it not , however , be thought that a warmer human interest is lacking to the story .

		Even spiritual struggles have their humorous aspects , and there is laughter as well as weeping in this eminently human narrative .

		Its appeal is made all the stronger by the easy identification of its two leading characters , father and son , as a once well-known naturalist of the anti-Darwinian school , and a prominent author of our own time , respectively .

		Or , to be more specific , the father is Philip
Henry Gosse	PERSON	, best remembered for his '' Romance of Natural History , '' though he wrote many other popular text-books of a similar sort ; and the son , of course , is Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	, who needs no further introduction .

		Any possible doubter may easily convince himself by turning to Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	's brief account of his father in the '' Dictionary of National Biography '' and com - paring that record with the book .

		The latter shows no attempt at concealment except in cer - tain very natural suppressions or alterations of personal names .

		No outline of the book can do it justice , but a few selected passages may quicken the reader 's interest and inspire him with a desire to possess himself of the story in full .

		The peculiar re - ligious beliefs of the father and mother were • Father and Son .

		Bio ^ aphical Recollections .

		With por - trait .

		New York :
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		those of the so-caUed ''
Plymouth	LOCATION	Brethren . ''

		Each parent '' was prominent before the eyes of a public of his or her own , half a century ago , '' and it is largely because `` their minds were vigorous and their accomplishments dis - tinguished that the contrast between their spiritual point of view and the aspect of a similar class of persons to-day is interesting , '' and , the author hopes , instructive .

		The mother , it should be noted , was intellectually gifted to such an extent that she became a fair Greek and a still better Hebrew scholar , besides writ - ing and publishing devotional poems that met with considerable acceptance .

		The father 's talents as a naturalist , his power of close scrutiny and accurate observation , won for him from Huxley the doubtful compliment of being called the '' honest hodman of science . ''

		Both father and mother were zealous workers in the church , indefatigable seekers after lost souls , and insistent that their son should be equally active , in season and out of season , in the woric of testimony and conversion .

		But let the author speak for himself .

		`` The peculiarities of a family life , founded upon such principles , are , in relation to a little child , obvious ; but I may be permitted to recapitulate them .

		Here was perfect purity , perfect intrepidity , perfect abnegation ; yet there was also narrowness , isolation , an absence of perspective , let it be boldly admitted , an absence of humanity .

		And there was a curious mixture of humble - ness and arrogance ; entire resignation to the will of God and not less entire disdain of the judgment and opinion of man .

		My parents founded every action , every atti - tude , upon their interpretation of the Scriptures , and upon the guidance of the Divine Will as revealed to them by direct answer to prayer .

		Their ejaculation in the face of any dilemma was , ' Let us cast it before the Lord ! ' ''

		But it was this very habit of carrying every - thing to the Lord in prayer that first occa - sioned , in the son 's restlessly inquiring mind , a doubt of the parental infallibility .

		Just how this first germ of skepticism was planted and nourished is vividly and humorously told in the book . ''

		The question of the efficacy of prayer , which has puz - zled wiser heads than mine , began to trouble me .

		It was insisted on in our household that if anything was de - sired , you should not , as my Mother said , ' lose any time in seeking for it , but ask God to guide you to it . '

		In many junctures of life , this is precisely what , in sober fact , they did .

		I will not dwell here on their theories , which my mother put forth , with imflinching directness , in her published writings .

		But I found that a difference was made between my privileges in this matter and theirs , and this led me to many discussions .

		My parents said : ' Whatever you need , tell Him and He will grant it , if it is His will . '

		Very well ; I had need of a large painted humming-top which i had seen in a shop - window in the Caledonian Road .

		Accordingly , I introduced a
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 97 supplication for this object into my evening prayer , care - fully adding the words : ` If it is Thy will . '

		This , I recollect , placed my Mother in a dilemma , and she con - sulted my Father .

		Taken , I suppose , at a disadvantage , my Father told me I must not pray for ' things like that . '

		To which I answered by another query , ` Why ? '

		And I added that he said we ought to pray for things we needed , and that I needed the humming-top a great deal more than I did the conversion of the heathen or the restitution of
Jerusalem	LOCATION	to the Jews , two objects .

		of my nightly supplication which left me very cold . ''

		The father was plainly cornered , especially as the son had been expressly taught that '' no things or circumstances are too insignificant to bring before the God of the whole earth . ''

		In the end , therefore , the elder simply refused to argue the question , and flatly told the boy it was wrong to pray for things like humming - tops , and he must do it no more .

		The fatal suspicion was left in the infant mmd that a traceable connection existed between this per - emptory prohibition , the cost of the coveted toy , and the state of the family exchequer .

		A further and more fatal shaking of the child 's faith in the God of his parents came a little later .

		Having obtained from his father a categorical statement that idolatry consisted in praying to anyone or anything but God him - seK , and also that God would be very angry and would show his wrath if anyone in a Christian country bowed down to wood or stone , the still skeptical child took advantatage of a moment when he was alone in the house to put the matter to a decisive test .

		Placing a small chair on a table , he knelt before it and repeated his daily prayer , only substituting the address '' O Chair '' for the usual one .

		But the sole result was a quickening of the young idolater 's heart-beat as he waited to be consumed by the wrath of heaven .

		After that the boy had less confidence than ever in his father 's knowledge of the divine mind .

		Cut off from the world of boyish sports and games , from the world of literature and art , and from almost everything necessary for a boy 's healthy development , this lonely child was taught to regard himself as marked out for peculiar service in the vineyard of the Lord , and as the early recipient of extraordinary favors from on high .

		He was among the '' saved , '' and was not to associate too intimately with the chil - dren of the ungodly .

		What a marvel that the little prig -- for such he acknowledges himself to have been -- ever recovered from so pernicious a training !

		One 's respect for his later achieve - ments in the world of letters is greatly heightened by this account , almost painfully minute , of his starved , strait-laced , self-conscious childhood .

		One unexpected indulgence , however , at his father 's hands must here be noted .

		The mother 's early death and the father 's second marriage , to Miss
Eliza Brightwen	PERSON	, have a bearing on the incident . ''

		At the age of eleven , I knew a great deal more of maps , and of the mutual relation of localities all over the globe , than most grown-up people do .

		... I was now greatly taken with the geography of the
West Indies	LOCATION	, of every part of which I had made MS. maps .

		There was something powerfully attractive to my fancy in the great chain of the Antilles , lying on the sea like an open bracelet , with its big jewels and little jewels strung on an invisible thread .

		I liked to shut my eyes and see it all , in a mental panorama , stretched from
Cape Sant	LOCATION	' Antonio to the
Serpent	ORGANIZATION	's Mouth .

		Several of these lovely islands , these emeralds and amethysts , set on the
Caribbean Sea	LOCATION	, my Father had known well in his youth , and I was importunate in questioning him about them .

		One day as I multiplied inquiries , he rose , as I did so , in his impetuous way , and climbing to the top of a book - case , brought down a thick volume and presented it to me , < You '11 find all about the Antilles there , ' he said , and left me with *
Tom Cringle	PERSON	's Log ' in my possession . ''

		The story of the youth 's growing differences with his father in matters of religion , of his breaking away from home and insisting on living his own life -- a course in which he was rather aided than opposed by his kind step - mother -- has a peculiar though a painful inter - est that holds one 's attention to the end of the book .

		We take leave of the narrator in his early manhood , his mind powerfully stirred , and providentially stirred , with the conviction that '' either he must cease to think for himself ; or his individualism must be instantly confirmed , and the necessity of religious independence must be emphasized . ''

		No book could better show the vast difference between plausible but wholly imaginary biography and autobiography -LRB- of which we have had many graceful specimens of late -RRB- on the one hand , and the actual record of a human soid on the other , than this detailed account of the warring of two discordant tem - peraments .

		Impressions of a Correspoxdent in THE KUSSO-JAPANESE WAR .

		* During the late war in the Far East Mr.
Frederick McCormick	PERSON	, in the capacity of
Associated Press	ORGANIZATION	correspondent , supplied the English-speaking world with what usually proved to be the most authentic information to be had , especially from the Russian side , con - cerning the course and character of the struggle .

		After the war was over Mr.
McCormick	PERSON	, like more than one of his fellow-correspondents , was • The Tragedy op

Frederick McCJormick	PERSON	.

		In two volumes .

		New York :
The Outing Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		98 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, moved to bring together his scattered papers , revise and enlarge them , and put them before the public in more durable form .

		The two stout volumes which have lately come from the press , under the somewhat lugubrious title of '' The Tragedy of
Russia	LOCATION	in
Pacific Asia	LOCATION	, '' com - prise the result .

		It is safe to say that to the rapidly growing library of books upon Far Eastern subjects they wUl constitute a note - worthy , even if not an indispensable , acquisition .

		The value of Mr.
McCormick	PERSON	's work arises wholly from the intimacy with which the author was acquainted with the conditions , the per - sonalities , and the events of the war .

		Mr.
McCormick	PERSON	is very far from being an historian .

		He does not appeal to one as a profound student of contemporary world-politics -- if , indeed , it is possible for one to be such a student without being also a pretty respectable historian .

		He is not even a wholly satisfactory writer of the English language ; at least , the happy-go-lucky newspaper style above which he seldom rises scarcely commends itself in a work of the present pretensions .

		Yet , despite these more or less serious limitations , a perusal of his vol - umes is sufficient to give the assurance that they contain much that is essential to a full knowl - edge of the war , and a good deal that one may never be able to lay hold of elsewhere .

		Practically aU of the first , and about half of the second , volume is taken up with a running sketch of the operations of the war from the attack on Port
Arthur	PERSON	to the capture and de - struction of the Russian mobile navy .

		Extended comment upon this portion of the work is per - haps hardly necessary .

		In a succession of some forty chapters , accompanied by a number of useful drawings and photographs , the plans of campaigns , descriptions of tactics , battle-scenes , and personal episodes follow one another in a gossipy but fairly luminous narrative .

		It is not a formal history , but such material as wiU be of large service when the time comes for the writ - ing of a formal history of this epoch-marking war .

		After covering thus in detail the course of the conflict itself , Mr.
McCormick	PERSON	turns to an estimate of the combatants , and finally to some consideration of the effects of the Japanese victory upon the Occident , and more particu - larly upon the
United States	LOCATION	.

		There is vastly more upon the Russians than upon the Japanese , for the author was with the Russian armies throughout , and naturally writes more fuUy , as well as more authoritatively , upon them than upon their opponents .

		With respect , then , first of aU , to the Russians , we are assured that though they have uniformly showed their worst side in the
Orient	LOCATION	, it has come to be conceded by all
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	peoples that the Muscovites are a potent , and not necessarily an altogether baleful , force in the modern world .

		The Japanese were among the first to awake to the fact .

		The disheartening exigencies of an unsuccessful war were certainly calculated to put the Russian character to the test .

		The residts of this test Mr.
McCormick	PERSON	undertakes , at much length , to describe .

		It is his judgment that , despite occasional outbreaks of treachery and cowardice , the virtues of valor and humanity were as strongly in evidence in the Russian trenches as in the Japanese .

		Russian preparations for war were pitiably inadequate , and from first to last the difficulties to be over - come were essentially insuperable ; but the fight was a brave one , and , on the whole , one of which no people need be ashamed .

		None the less , the impressions of the Russian military that one gets from Mr.
McCormick	PERSON	's narrative are far from roseate .

		In fact , while striving manifestly after impartiality , the author finds himself obliged to devote a really startling proportion of his space to the faults and weak - nesses -LRB- not to mention crimes -RRB- which he had ever before him in the Russian camps . ''

		The virtues of the Russian are incomparable , ... but they are insignificant beside his incomparable de - fects .

		The complicated , futile , and useless labor of secret agents , intelligence officers , gendarmes , police advisors , and censors in the Russian military organization in itself represented enough energy to win a battle .

		The energy wasted in flirtations was sufficient to plan a campaign or take a city ; while the talent and energy spent in dissi - pation and graft , were enough to have won the war twice over .

		The battles of the war show an over-reliance on organization , which fed the army well , mobilized it in a marvellous maimer , cared for its retreats , but could not advance it , nor maneuver it in battle , nor bring it along - side victory .

		... In
Manchuria	LOCATION	the Russian military presents an undignified and demoralized appearance .

		Among no military , perhaps , were boots and buckles and big clothes held in such awe .

		There was an unnecessary number of overtrained militaires , exceedingly sensitive of their dignity , and more afraid of their reputations for nicety and savoir faire than of defeat ... Militarism appeared to be their vanity .

		They lacked one at least of the essential elements of warriors -- military aggres - siveness .

		Their disposition was to hibernate and grow fat .

		Their disposition was peaceful .

		For this reason Russians felt much aggrieved and warred upon , in - humanly assailed , and outrageously insulted . ''

		That the Russians sadly imderestimated the formidable character of their opponents , and generally misconceived the whole situation , is well enough known to followers of Far Eastern affairs . ''

		The general conception of the war was that
Russia	LOCATION	, in the form of a peaceful genius , holding a lily in one hand and a dove in the other , was sprung upon in the
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 99 night by a naked savage , armed with a villainous knife , bent upon murder .

		The figure of this peaceable Russian female genius , with a sheathed sword entwined with bay and a proclamation of peace and good-will from
Nicholas	PERSON	in her lap , and on her head a cap bearing the cross of Christ , is represented in the illustrated press enthroned upon the rock of Port
Arthur	PERSON	, gazing innocently upon the world , invested by beasts and ogres from the deep , and about to be assassinated by a half-naked Japanese figure coming out of the sea . ''

		As the war progressed , however , there was dis - illusionment , and '' it can be said with justice that the conviction that the war was a national crime rapidly grew among them , so that toward the last the justness of their cause was generally denied among themselves . ''

		Elsewhere Mr.
McCorraick	PERSON	, writing of the low ebb reached by the discipline among the Russian troops , asserts that toward the end at least one-third of the army regarded the war as a crime , and were disposed to surrender to the enemy .

		Rarely indeed has there been put in print a more striking arraignment of the Russian in arms .

		Allowing for more or less exaggeration , in these days , of the virtues of the opposing Japanese , it is still inconceivable that the out - come of the war should have been other than what it was .

		In a not altogether convincing , but none the less suggestive , chapter on '' The Elimination of the West and the Position of
America	LOCATION	, '' the author presents what , from the
Occidental	ORGANIZATION	standpoint , must be adjudged a pessimistic picture .

		He expresses the conviction that as a result of the signal triumph of the Japanese and the revivification of
China	LOCATION	the hold of European powers -- especially of
France	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	-- upon Far Eastern affairs has been greatly relaxed .

		Even more confidently is it declared that there has been a marked falling - off in American influence in the Orient . ''

		The main political figure in the West in the struggle for the integrity of
China	LOCATION	is that of
John Hay	PERSON	, but
John Hay	PERSON	's work , which in the end was inadequate , is about the only asset left to
America	LOCATION	in the
East	LOCATION	.

		The Amer - ican people did not know how to turn it to account or to back it up , and have receded from the position of respect which he achieved for them .


Russia	LOCATION	, the greatest enemy of the principles for which he contended , and of the reconstructed
East Asia	LOCATION	with which
America	LOCATION	is now forced to compromise , regards this with open satisfac - tion and anticipates a change of American policy , even more satisfactory from being in conformity with the principles of her own ...
America	LOCATION	's position in the
East	LOCATION	has been changed .

		Events have reduced her in two years to a position of comparative imimportance in Peking .

		Of all the pro-Japanese ' open-door ' and Chinese integrity nations it is
America	LOCATION	that stands low - est there .

		Traditional friendship , sympathy understood and expressed upon every occasion when it could be of any value , gifts of charity , moral aid and repeated ser - vices to the cause of the < open door ' and the preserva - tion of Chinese integrity in particular , have not availed against a combination of really mean circmnstances , and are little more than a name .

		Her prestige gained from meritorious acts dissolved , and positive misfortune has overtaken her through Chinese commercial hostility . ''

		Mr.
McCormick	PERSON	's second volume contains a documentary appendix of considerable value ; also a very useful chronological table of events in the Russian '' tragedy '' from the
Treaty of Nerchinsk	ORGANIZATION	in
1689	DATE	to the ratification of the Peace of
Portsmouth	LOCATION	.


Frederic Austin Ogg	PERSON	.

		Two Histories of Music * In the recent great access of books dealing with musical subjects there has been a plentiful lack of informational works covering the whole field or any large portion of it . ''

		Impressions '' that do not always impress , opinions that do little more than opine , we have had in abund - ance ; but the way was still suggestively open for any broad and comprehensive survey .

		In England the '' History of Music '' of
Rowbotham	PERSON	-LRB- 1885-7 -RRB- , and that of Rockstro -LRB- 1886 -RRB- left much to be desired ; and in
America	LOCATION	, Professor
Dickinson	PERSON	's scholarly '' Study of the History of Music '' -LRB-
1905	DATE	-RRB- was necessarily quite concise .

		It is a coincidence that two books by American musical scholars should just now have made abnost simultaneous appearance , which are of enough serious importance to deserve special attention .

		The desideratum of a treatise which should be a hand-book and guide , which should attain a certain degree of encyclopasdic fulness , and yet by its precise and systematic arrangement should help the student without hindering him -- and which should achieve these ends within the com - pass of a single volume -- has been satisfactorily met by Professor
Waldo Selden Pratt	PERSON	's '' His - tory of Music . ''

		The author 's long and fruitful labors at
Hartford Theological Seminary	ORGANIZATION	, sup - plemented by lectures at
Smith College	ORGANIZATION	and elsewhere , have been creditable to American musical scholarship ; and in the book before us he has increased the literature of music by a contribution of permanent value .

		One of the first merits of the work to deserve commendation is the excellent topical arrange - ment in divisions and subdivisions , which makes the book immediately useful to the hurried *

		100 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, searcher after facts .

		The eight great epochs of musical history are presented in thirty-seven chapters and 234 sections .

		Important move - ments and composers are given the dignity of large type ; an ample though not exhaustive bibliography is appended to each chapter ; cross - references are not forgotten ; and two carefully - made indexes complete a hand-apparatus which will not disappoint either the student or the general reader .

		This adherence to topical sys - tem has made it necessary sometimes to speak of the same composer at some length in two or more widely separated passages ; as where , for example ,
Liszt	PERSON	and the orchestral style of pian - ism are discussed on pp. 539-540 ,
Liszt	PERSON	and the
Weimar	LOCATION	circle on pp. 574-575 , and
Liszt	PERSON	and the symphonic poem on pp. 581-585 .

		Another good feature is the imerringtsense of proportion which pervades the work .

		Pro- fessor
Pratt	ORGANIZATION	sees the field steadily and sees it whole .

		He seems constantly to have in mind the end from the beginning ; and there is no evidence of prejudice expanding a favorite theme , or lassitude abridging the concluding chapters .

		An illustration of this is his admir - able treatment of Mendelssohn -- whose almost total elimination from modern orchestral concert - programmes is a real misfortune .

		Professor
Pratt	PERSON	recognizes the spontaneity and charm of his music , its perfection of form , its happy com - bination of the classic and the romantic ; but justly lays more stress on the signal services which he performed by his social and profes - sional influence , '' to which he added the massive and continued power of the several organizations and institutions with which he was connected ; so that the effectiveness of his ideas was larger and more lasting than through his work as an individual . ''

		This is just and true ; and is in wholesome contrast to the disproportionate im - portance assigned to
Mendelssohn in Grove	ORGANIZATION	's `` Dictionary of Music , '' where he has 58 pages as against 47 for
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	, 40 for
Schumann	PERSON	, and 28 for
Wagner	PERSON	.

		Professor
Pratt	PERSON	's historical erudition is per - haps best seen in his treatment of the early periods of this most ancient and most modern of the arts .

		His chapters on `` Uncivilized and Ancient Music '' range over the whole world of antiquity , and present in readable schemata what is probably the sum of our information on an obscure subject .

		With the sixteenth cen - tury -- '' the meeting-place of mediaeval and modem life , '' the material rapidly multiplies , and the author must exert to the utmost his powers of comparison and perspective .

		The last of the book 's great divisions is called '' a brief sketch of the later nineteenth century '' ; and here alone , and very wisely .

		Professor
Pratt	PERSON	refrains from fulness of treatment or any attempt at finality of judgment .

		Its five sections dis - cuss '' The Wagnerian Triumph , '' the various national '' groups , '' and '' Music in the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		Its up-to-date scope may be seen in the fact that
Grieg	ORGANIZATION	's death is recorded -LRB- Sep - tember ,
1907	DATE	-RRB- .

		To these summaries is appended a concluding section , entitled '' Some Final Words , '' in which the breadth of vision and the well-tempered criticism of the entire work are finely condensed .

		He urges the solidar - ity of the art from a historical view-point and the organic association of the many aspects of music : '' No just view of music or musicianship can afford to disdain or ignore any side of the subject , however distant from the standpoint of the observer himself .

		The instrumentalist can not say to the vocalist , ' I have no need of you , ' nor the operatic singer to the critic , nor the theorist to the maker of instruments , nor the genius in composition to the promoter of interest among amateurs . ''

		The numerous illustrations of musical instru - ments are extremely interesting ; so much can hardly ^ be said of the likenesses of composers , which are conventional drawings from tradi - tional portraits .

		An unusual feature in a work of this kind is the addition of three maps show - ing those regions of
Europe	LOCATION	in which music has been chiefly developed .

		In Professor
Pratt	PERSON	's notices of native-bom American composers occurs the following par - agraph : ''
John Knowles Paine	PERSON	-LRB- d.
1906	DATE	-RRB- , from
1862	DATE	teacher and from
1896	DATE	professor -LRB- of music -RRB- , was not only an expert organist , but an abimdant and striking composer , with two symphonies , two symphonic poems , chamber music , the oratorio St.
Peter	PERSON	, incidental music to Sophocles ' -LRB- Edipus Tyrannus , a mass , several choral cantatas , and many shorter works . ''

		This compact statement presents the barest outline of a long and useful career .

		As a com - poser , it is probably true that Professor
Paine	PERSON	made no such impress on his generation as , for instance ,
MacDowell	ORGANIZATION	has done ; but as teacher and lecturer he has inspired hundreds of men who came under his influence at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	, many of whom have achieved distinction in their chosen art .

		THE DIAL 101 they were originally prepared .

		It seems that it was a cherished wish of Professor
Paine	PERSON	to have his lectures on the
History of Music	ORGANIZATION	published ; and he had prepared , in type-written form , the material covering the period to the death of
Schubert	ORGANIZATION	.

		Since his death , this part of the lectures has been revised and put through the press by his colleague .

		Professor
Albert A. Howard	PERSON	.

		Though in a sense unfinished , the work is no mere torso .

		It is a dignified , lucid , and sym - pathetic account of the great steps in the devel - opment of the art , from the earliest music of the Greeks and Romans down to
1828	DATE	, the year of
Schubert	ORGANIZATION	's death .

		As Professor
Paine	PERSON	was con - servative in taste , it is probable that his opinion of the modern schools would not command the general assent which will greet his estimate of the great classics .

		As suitable to the plan of the lectures , the treatment of the subject is broad , and no attempt is made to register every name -- major or minor ; consequently consid - erable fulness is possible in the consideration of the masters , the chapters on
Bach	PERSON	,
Handel	ORGANIZATION	,
Haydn	ORGANIZATION	,
Gluck	PERSON	,
Mozart	PERSON	,
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	, and
Schubert	ORGANIZATION	being symmetrical monographs .

		Professor
Howard	PERSON	's task as editor has been carried out with discrimination and loving care ; and his part in the work is probably a larger one than his modesty will allow him to admit .

		He will certainly share in the gratitude with which Professor
Paine	PERSON	's book will be received by his old pupils and the musical public .

		The Axatomy of Diffidence .

		* That strange malady known as diffidence or shyness or bashfulness is an affair about which men seldom talk .

		Those who are its victims are reticent iii this as in all else ; and to the rest of the world the thing is either incomprehensible or riduculous or both .

		Except in its mildest form , as a passing symptom of adolescence , it has received scant attention from psychologists or physicians .

		Yet it has been and is the most potent and painful fact in hundreds of lives ; and many of the world 's finest intellects have been molded irresistibly in its influence .

		It has remained for an English writer hitherto quite unknc -RRB- wn , Mr.
W. Compton Leith	PERSON	, to for - mulate the
Anatomy of Diffidence	ORGANIZATION	, as

		did of Melancholy ; and it might almost be said that he has done it with equal charm .

		Indeed his book seems , to one reader at least , to sur - pass in beauty and distinction of style any other prose work of the past few years .

		Its charm is akin to that of Mr.
A. C. Benson	PERSON	's earlier books , yet Mr.
Benson	PERSON	at his best has never equalled this .

		An acute sufferer throughout a lifetime from the disease of which he writes , the author has yielded in later years to that insatiate hunger for utterance and self-justification so marked in the afflicted of his kind ; and in these pages he has set down such data as he could , for possible use when the '' inevitable German '' shall pre - pare his `` Wissenschaftliche Untersuchung der Ursache und Entwicklung der Schiichternheit . ''

		The result is a human document as striking as it is unusual . ''

		As I reflect upon what I have written , '' says the author , '' and try to imagine it read by some brisk person utterly content with life , I can well understand that the whole thing would appear to him incredible , too pre - posterously strange for belief , a rigmarole of sick fancies beyond the power of hellebore . ''

		S6 doubtless it would ; but to those who have known the scourge of this affliction , or of another as great , the impress of truth and wisdom lies deep upon every page .

		Lest any might suppose that the disorder here dealt with is a matter no more serious than that awkward timidity which most of us have known in youth , we subjoin this paragraph : '' At the outset I would make it clear that for me the only shyness that counts , is that which is so deeply mgrained as to have outlasted youth .

		It may , indeed , be physically related to that transient bashfulness which haunts so many of us in our younger days only to vanish at maturity , swift as the belated ghost at cockcrow .

		But unlike this common accident of growth , it is no surface-defect , but an inward stain which dyes the very fibres of the being .

		It may , indeed , be somewhat bleached and diminished by a timely and skilful treat - ment , but is become too much a part of life to be ever wholly washed away .

		And the unhappy step-children of nature whose inheritance it is , seldom find a deliverer good at need ; for as the world draws no distinction between their grave affliction and that other remediable misery of youth , it will sanction no other treatment than banter or mockery , which does but infuse yet more deeply the mournful dye .

		When this fails , it leaves its victims to the desolation which according to its judg - ment they have wilfully chosen ; for the most part ignoring their existence , but often chastising them with scorpion-stings of disdain .

		Yet the subjects of this scorn , sufferers as I believe from a hereditary tendency matured by neglect into disease , deserve a more merci - ful usage than this , and their plea for extenuating cir - cumstances should not be too impatiently rejected .

		For in them what is to most men a transient ailment has 102 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, thrown down permanent roots to draw a nourishment from pain : and he who is fortunate enough to be whole should think twice before he makes sport of those who pine in this distress . ''

		The malady has its cause , we are told , in `` an antinomy between the physical and intellectual elements of the personality , from an unhappy marriage of mind and body , suilering the lower of the two partners to ruin the life of the higher by the continual friction of a hateful but indis - soluble union . ''

		It is found more commonly in men , and among those classes where the outward refinements of life are more or less compulsory .

		It is climatic also , having its haunts chiefly in the north and west of
Europe	LOCATION	, -- as no less an authority than
M. Taine	PERSON	has previously borne witness .

		And as it is climatic and geographic , so are its birth and growth conditioned by his - toric causes . ''

		Just as it is the peculiar failing of northern and western peoples , so it is the creation of comparatively modern times ; it had no place among the classified weaknesses of men until these peoples began in their turn to make history . ''

		But , valuable as these facts and theories may prove to the '' inevitable German '' above re - ferred to , it is in the author 's record of his own inner life that the real charm and interest of the book lie , -- the pages wherein '' His store of sad experience he Lays bare of wretched days ; Tells us his misery 's birth and growth and signs , And how the dying spark of hope was fed , And how the breast was soothed , and how the head , And all his hourly varied anodynes . ''

		The first awakening , after an embittered boy - hood , '' to the dread thought that though other clouds might drift westward and dissolve , one would impend over me forever '' brought with it an insistent desire for flight ; and the environ - ment of
London	LOCATION	was forthwith exchanged for a lonely plantation in the mountains of
India	LOCATION	.

		Three years of peacefid meditation in this old - world atmosphere were effective in lulling the pain ; then came an attack of fever , and with convalescence a revulsion of feeling toward the slumbrous Oriental existence and a determina - tion to meet the old foe , if need be , on the home field .

		Plunging once more into the roaring life of
London	LOCATION	, he summoned to his aid every resource of nature , literature , art , and phil - osophy that might enable him to endure and outbrave the torment ; until gradually , step by step , he was led by their ministries to the goal that held permanent assuagement -- '' the pres - ence of the Ideal Love . '' ''

		There is a place in every heart which must be filled by adoration , or else the whole will grow hard and wither like a garden whose central fountain is grown dry .

		And though the affection of mortal man or woman may abandon it , there remains yet this other love which by pure and strenuous invocation may be drawn to it , and dwell in it , to the ennoblement of life ; so great is the care of providence for mortal need .

		Love is our need , and it is given , if we despair not of it , even to such as have rarely felt the glow of earthly passion .

		For love is of many kinds ; yet the palest and most subtle of its forms are made real to those who believe , and may become the guiding influences of their lives .

		Such are the visions of the ideal love to which those glad natural sympathies now led me , leaving me alone awhile that I might worship the orient light .

		And when I came out from that presence I rejoiced indeed , for the path was clear for my return , and life was now glad with promise like an orchard burgeoning with white blossoms .

		Old memories crowded back on me of hours beneath the cedars with the Phsedrus and the
Vita Nuova	PERSON	, hours made happy with intellectual and aesthetic delights .

		But now the joy was other than intellectual , though significant tenfold , for then in untried youth I had wondered at the beauty of an imaginary world ; now with eyes that had looked on desolation I perceived that these visions were true .

		For had they been no more than aerial fancies , they surely had not endured throughout these long ages in our laden and mortal air . ''

		From these heights of the spirit one might indeed look out upon life without bitterness .

		Though the chance for happiness had long since withered , yet something of serenity was stiU possible ; and the old enemy , if not wholly vanquished , was yet disabled and subdued .

		From a volume distinguished on every page for beauty of style , it is difficult to detach for quotation one or two paragraphs of particular dis - tinction .

		Yet perhaps the two we have chosen will serve as well as any .

		This first describes the initial onslaught of an Indian monsoon : `` One year I was witness of the first onset , which came in the late afternoon -- an immediate shock of massed clouds without throwing forward of skirmishers or any prelude of the vanguard .

		Our home looked down upon a gentle incline of open grassy land to a broad belt of jungle in the middle distance ; here the imdergrowth and small trees had been newly cleared away , opening a perspective receding across an uncum - bered leaf-strewn floor into the backward gloom of the forest .

		I sat with my eyes fixed upon the trees , draw - ing the rain on with the whole strength of desire to the parched country lying there faint with the exhaustion of three months of drought .

		While I watched , the deep line of cloud , at first distinct from the forest-top along which it came rolhng , insensibly merged with the foliage , until every contour was lost in a common gloom , only the great bare stems below standing pale against the gathering darkness .

		There was an intense stillness everywhere like the silence of expectation which falls upon an awestruck crowd ; the very insects had ceased their usual song .

		And now the ear caught a distant sound , vague and deep , coming up out of the mid dark -
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 103 ness , and growing to a mighty volume as a sudden wind swept out from the sounding foliage into the open land and searched every cranny of the house as it passed .

		Then , as if drawn by the wind , there came into view among the nearest tree-stems a moving grey line advancing with a long roar until it hid the whole forest from sight : it was the wave of battle about to break upon us .

		It came on like a wall , enormous , irresistible ; one instant , and it had devoured the intervening space ; another , and we were lost in the deluge , and the great rain-drops were spilled upon the roof with the noise of continuous thunder .

		As the deep sound reverberated through the roof above me , I went in exulting to a hearth piled with blazing logs , glad in the prospect of renewing for many weeks old and quiet habitudes of indoor life , rich with solace of books and tranquil med - itation . ''

		And in the following is set down a subtle experi - ence that must have come to every sensitive being that ever made his bed beneath the open sky .


Stevenson	PERSON	has described a similar incident not more finely . ''

		The exuberant sun of noon distracts , and the mul - titude of his beams is troublous , for what does sight avail if the things of the heart 's desire are lost in im - measureable perplexities of light ?

		For in the high day the quivering bright air is more opaque than the dim spaces of night , so tranquil and severe , or the glowing kingdoms of the morning .

		At the springing of the day the eyes open upon awakening flowers , giving filial heed to the marvellous earth which waits in patience for a human greeting .

		I like the passage in which
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	tells how in May-time his couch was spread in an arbour upon the margin of the grass , that he might wake to see the daisies unfold their petals .

		Sleeping thus , he also must have known those intervals of slumber when a sense of some impending wonder grows too strong for sleep , and all nature seems calling you to a vision .

		Often I have been thus awakened , not by noise or movement , but as it were by some strange prescience of beauty constraining me to rise and look .

		Once I was drawn some distance I ` ound the corner of a copse , and there , low in the sable-blue of the sky , in a rivalry of intense but dazzling light , the crescent moon hung splendid over against a great constellation which glittered like a car - canet of diamonds .

		They seemed to speak together as if in some scene or passage of celestial drama , nor did I know which was the diviner speech , the moon 's unwaver - ing effulgence or that leaping coruscation of the stars .

		Nothing stirred on the right hand or the left , but earth and air were hushed , as if before that colloquy all somid and motion were miraculously holden .

		Tall trees brown with densest shadows were massed upon one side , obscuring half the heaven , and lending by their contrasted gloom that sense of wizardry m natural things which enchants the clear
summer	DATE	nights when the air is still . ''

		The shy fraternity will need no word of ours to lead them to this book .

		But we hope that what has been said here will turn the lover of literature to the volume also , knowing as we do that it holds for him a pleasure not often vouch - safed in these days of universal scribbling .

		Dutch History from the Sources .

		* Simultaneously with the fourth instalment of the projected set of five volumes , in English translation , of Dr.
Blok	PERSON	's '' History of the Peo - ple of
the Netherlands	LOCATION	, '' there comes to the reviewer Volume VIII .

		of the original Dutch , which , finishing the fourteenth book , completes also the history of the kingdom from the time '' The Dutch took
Holland	LOCATION	'' after
Waterloo	LOCATION	, to the revision of the Constitution in
1887	DATE	.

		The end crowns the work , for it rounds out the great life-task of the professor of Dutch history in
Holland	LOCATION	's noblest university .

		Dr.
Blok	PERSON	, born at the
Helder	PERSON	in
1855	DATE	, took his degree of Doctor of Letters at Ley den .

		After fifteen years spent in the teaching of history and in researches among the archives of more countries than one , on the death of
Robert Fruin	PERSON	he was called from the same chair at
Gronigen University	ORGANIZATION	to the professorship of Dutch history at his Alma Mater .

		Previous to the first issue of his initial volume of the '' History of the Dutch People , '' in
1892	DATE	, his monographs had shown great powers of research and correlation of facts , besides giving some indications of ability to produce a history that should be a work of lit - erature as well as of learning .

		Now that the reader of English has already the bulk of the story before him , it is possible to judge fairly the outcome of the work of a man who may indeed in outward guise have grown old in un - ceasing labors and profoundest erudition , but whose every page shows the enthusiasm and fire of youth , and a positive delight in making truth as beautiful as her own imperious limita - tions will allow .

		Dr.
Blok	PERSON	is neither a Motley nor a Macaulay , but for trustworthiness he is a leader beyond these masters of rhetoric and erudite scholarship .

		Happily , too .

		Dr.
Blok	PERSON	's decidedly modern Dutch style is strongly and felicitously rendered by the translator , Mr.
Oscar A. Bierstadt	PERSON	, who , with his former col - laborator .

		Miss
Ruth Putnam	PERSON	, deserves very high praise .

		The foregoing should not be taken to mean that the average American reader will find Blok 's '' History of the Netherlands '' thrilling .

		Unfortunately for the work done by Washing - ton Irving , and the perpetual object lesson afforded by the bric-a-brac mongers and curio - peddlars , helped by not a little after-dinner rhetoric from the kind of Dutchmen who can * History of the People of

Michi	LOCATION	- gan and
Iowa	LOCATION	of
1840	DATE	are too near for glory -RRB- , the contrast of sober facts is too great .

		It is undoubtedly true that the kind of American history that gets written in or near
Boston	LOCATION	and very handsomely published on
Manhattan Island	LOCATION	virtually ignores the part which the Dutchmen of
New York	LOCATION	, from
1664	DATE	to
1776	DATE	, played in the development of American liberties , so that we have the most shocking mistakes and omissions in the average popular historian concerning the Dutch in
America	LOCATION	; yet one must not suppose that to the historian of the old Netherlands the fortunes of
New Netherland	LOCATION	are anything more than a trifling episode .

		Avoiding the tempta - tion to expatiate on this point , we may add that it is difficult to get a clear understanding of the early history of our own
Middle States	LOCATION	without a knowledge of the background in the Dutch Fatherland , as shown in the lights and shadows on the pages of the present volume .

		Amid the currents of thought and opinion , the movements of society and polities .

		Dr.
Blok	PERSON	leads his readers with a minute knowledge that reminds us of the wealth and consummate classi - fications of the Rijks Museum .

		He draws per - fectly clear portraits of the great men , who , with astonishing frequency , were produced in
the Netherlands	LOCATION	.

		Indeed , one discerns a very miracle of history in the mere existence of a republic , positively contemptible as to size , in the midst of the monarchies on all sides which sought again and again to overwhelm it .

		In this fourth volume we have the story of calm after storm , when the great conciliatory states - man ,
Frederich Henry	PERSON	, healed the wounds of civil strife and had no small part himself in stimulating '' the bloom of the Republic . ''

		Other writers may have shown the genius and patience of
John De Witt	PERSON	, helmsmen of the ship of state , during the time of the '' stadholderless republic , '' but none has succeeded in giving us such a clear portrait of this quiet thinker who was the best type of the

		As in his previous volumes , Dr.
Blok	PERSON	presents in an appendix of highest value a critical estimate of his sources , an accurate colored map of the ever-changing area of
the Netherlands	LOCATION	, in the era described , and a good index .

		We shall look with pleasurable expecta - tion for the fifth and concluding volume of the English translation of this notable work .

		New Books about Old liANDS .

		* When the writer of a book of travel sets himself the task of describing an old land -- a land made familiar in song and story , in history and legend -- he must , in order to arouse our interest , appeal to us from some new point of view .

		However hack - neyed his theme , however commonplace his style , and however lacking his aptitude as a ti-aveller , if he possess the faculty of seeing and describing the old scenes from a new standpoint he may stimulate our jaded senses into something resembling first impressions .

		Much more , indeed , we can not ask of him .

		In our present list there are such books .

		Central
Asia	LOCATION	is shown to us as a most interesting ground for the study of climatic influences on char - acter ;
Tyrol	LOCATION	is seen through sympathetic modern eyes as a mediaeval land ;
Persia	LOCATION	is presented to us by the unique method of one man 's seeing it and another man 's writing about it ;
Somaliland	LOCATION	, that paradise of big-game hunters , is visited by two modern Dianas ; and the other books are not im - worthy of their company .

		Four years of travelling and living in
Asiatic Turkey	LOCATION	and three years of travel in
Central Asia	LOCATION	make the basis of Mr.
Ellsworth Huntington	PERSON	's excel - lent book entitled '' The Pulse of

		The main theme of the volume , however , recounts the author 's journey , made in
1905	DATE	, through Chinese Turkestan -- from
India	LOCATION	through
Kashmir	LOCATION	, thence along the

		THE BIAI .

		105 gives rare interest to his tale of wandering .

		Be - lieving that geography is an important basis for the study of anthropological science , and that geography and history are inseparable , he has spent these years in the arid lands of
Asia	LOCATION	to prove his thesis .

		His conclusion is that the habits and character of the people of
Central Asia	LOCATION	appear to have been molded by physiographic environment ; that '' during his - toric times , climate , the most important factor in that environment , has been subject to notable changes '' ; and finally , `` that the changes of climate have caused corresponding changes not only in the distribution of man , but in his occupations , habits , and even char - acter . ''

		An instance or two of the proofs advanced by the author will probably make his meaning clear .

		The Ladakhis , living in the
Himalayas	LOCATION	, are a people characterized by honesty , courage in spite of super - stition , industry , intense love of home , and cheerful - ness even in face of adverse circumstances , -- traits '' which seem to make mountaineers , of whatever race , better men than the inhabitants of plains , where life is easy . ''

		In marked contrast to these strong - willed people are the Chantos , probably of all races the nearest to the primitive Aryan stock .

		These Chantos live in densely populated but small and isolated oases . ''

		Their surroundings are pretty and attractive , but not varied enough to be inspiring .

		A short period of hard labor suffices to provide sus - tenance for the whole year , and the rest of the year is given over to prolonged idleness , with leisure for more of evil than of good . ''

		Hence the Chantos , seduced by their environment , are courteous , submis - sive , self-indulgent , cowardly , unstable , and feeble in parental and family ties .

		These pictures of contrast are very simple , much more simple and condensed than in the author 's account , which gives in minutest detail what we have briefly summarized .

		In his concluding chapter the author attempts to apply his thesis to the general course of history and human progress , especially to western
Asia	LOCATION	,
North Africa	LOCATION	, and
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Here Mr.
Huntington	PERSON	touches on de - batable ground , and advances views that are difficult of proof .

		Our space does not permit us to discuss these statements , but it is sufficient to suggest that the author sees a relationship between the financial crises and political changes in the
United States	LOCATION	and the rebellion in Chinese Turkestan , the famines in
Persia	LOCATION	and the Turkish massacres and revolts -- all due in some measure to climatic variations and conditions .

		Whatever our conclusions may be in regard to Mr.
Huntington	PERSON	's theories , we must allow him the credit of remarkably lucid presentation of a complex scientific question .

		Maps , a list of refer - ences , and especially an excellent index , enhance the physical features of the volume .

		Mr.
W. A. Baillie-Grohmann	PERSON	, the author of the volume on `` Tyrol : The Land in the
Mountains	LOCATION	, '' finds a good excuse for writing another book about this beautifully picturesque land , in the complaint of Englishmen and Americans `` that there is no history , be it ever so brief a one , of the country , in the lan - guage that they can read . ''

		To supply this demand the author writes most entertainingly of the history of
Tyrol	LOCATION	, and especially of its '' old castles that bear upon their crumbling walls the impress of old age to a degree not found elsewhere . ''

		Very wittily the writer adds that both the contents of the book and the author of it possess the qualification of age .

		But Mr.
Baillie-Grohmann	PERSON	needs no apology for himself or his book .

		His other books , especially '' Sport in the Alps '' and `` Camps .

		in the Rockies , '' are suffi - cient proof that he has a quick eye and a facile pen .

		Moreover , this volume , like his other books , is an honest piece of work , devoid of adventitious and alien interest .

		His history of Tyrol -LRB- he deprecates the usual designation of the
Tyrol	LOCATION	-RRB- is almost entirely concerned with the Middle Ages ; but he brings the account of the country down to the
last quarter of the nineteenth century	DATE	.

		Around ''
Schloss Matzen	PERSON	, '' his own castle home , he gathers interesting stories of the ancient knights and noble ladies ; of the
Brenner Pass	PERSON	, the oldest pass in the Alps , and of the famous mediaeval travellers who crossed it ; of the peasantry of the past and the present ; of life and art in the ancient castles ; of the the typical Tyrolese knights , the Frundsbergs , who lived at
Mataen Castle	ORGANIZATION	; and of ''
Schloss Matzen	PERSON	'' in modern times .

		Of neces - sity many pages in the book must be a dull catalogue of uninteresting facts and almost eventless dates ; but the author seldom fails to illuminate the darkness of mediaeval history with some narrative or anecdote which heightens the epical tone of his work .

		Tyrol has produced her giants and her strong men , and Mr.
BaUlie-Grohmann	PERSON	does not disdain to tell of them in a book carrying a heavy freight of mediaeval history .

		To the mere '' tripper '' who knows Tyrol only from the piazza of an
Innsbruck	LOCATION	hotel , this book will not appeal ; but to the more serious traveller and reader it wUl mark a valuable contribution to the history of a brave little land , rich in story and legend and strong in faith and courage .

		Over eighty good illustrations , showing characteristic scenes of mountains and hamlets , cottage interiors with their quaint furniture and even kitchen utensils , castle scenes with their antique curiosities and portraits of notable Tyrolese , add dignity and value to the vol - ume .

		Not least among the interesting features of the book is a sketch of the author written by his American friend , Mr.
Charles Landis	PERSON	. ''

		Pekin to
Paris	LOCATION	, '' by
Seiior Luigi Barzini	PERSON	, is the story of
Prince Borghese	LOCATION	's remarkable journey across
Asia	LOCATION	and
Europe	LOCATION	in a motor-car .

		On Feb - ruary 15 ,
1907	DATE	,
Prince Borghese	LOCATION	, having accepted the challenge issued by the
Paris	LOCATION	''
Matin	PERSON	, '' began a hasty but well-appointed preparation for the race , and soon started for
Pekin	LOCATION	, whence the race was to start .

		On
June 10	DATE	, five cars started on their eight thousand mile course .

		For two months the strong and heavy car '' Italia '' plunged or crept or ploughed or whisked through rivers , sands , quagmires , over rocks and by woodlands ; sometimes it moved of its own power , sometimes it was pulled along by a host of Chinese coolies , at other times it was assisted by animal power , -- but it was ever going forward .

		In 106 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, the Chinese Empire the party met the almost irri - sistible rocks of Ki-mi-ni ; in the Mongolian deserts the sands were almost too much for the machine ; in the Russian Empire they availed themselves of the rails of the Trans-Siberian Railway .

		Thus they came to the western borders of the Russian Empire , to the good roads of
Germany	LOCATION	and the better ones of
France	LOCATION	, and to their journey 's end .

		Difficult as that journey was , the party was most fortunate in almost every stage of the trip .

		Had it not been for the assistance of the local and the national govern - ments , had it not been that their fuel and lubricators were always at the appointed places , and , more than all else , had their unfortunate accidents proved serious or fatal , they could never have accomplished their purpose .

		Some of their escapes were hardly short of providential .

		Once their car plunged through a bridge , making such havoc of both bridge and car that the picture showing the catastrophe makes one marvel at the escape of the occupants of the car .

		Prince
Borghese	PERSON	was `` jammed between a beam and the engine of the car , crushed by it , unable to breathe .

		With the strength which comes to men sometimes at a crisis , he somehow raised the car for an instant and freed himself . ''

		The car was a forty horse-power machine , weighing over four thousand pounds !

		Notwithstanding such hin - drances and accidents , the journey ended at the office of the `` Matin '' on
August 10	DATE	-- two months from the time of starting .

		The volume contains an inter - esting and modest introduction by the Prince , a hundred good illustrations , and an excellent detailed map showing the route traversed .

		Sefior Barzini 's style , as translated by Sefior De Castelvecchio , is best described by
Prince Borghese	LOCATION	as vivacious : no other style could possibly do justice to the subject .

		Prince Borghese quite agrees with those persons who asserted that such a journey was impossible , -- for `` it is impossible to go by motor-car alone , com - fortably seated on the cushions of the same , from
Pekin	LOCATION	to
Paris	LOCATION	. ''

		Bottom 's assertion that '' a lion among ladies is a most dreadful thing '' is reversed in Miss
Agnes Herbert	PERSON	's . ''

		Two Dianas in SomalUand . ''

		Miss
Herbert	PERSON	and her cousin Cecily proved most dread - ful among the lions , leopards , rhinoceroses , wolves , hyenas , deer , and `` other fearful wild-fowl '' -- to adopt Bottom 's classification .

		Having gathered some experience as a huntress in the
Canadian Rockies	ORGANIZATION	, and being a niece of a famous African hunter ,
Miss Herbert	LOCATION	is not a novice in big-game shooting and its requirements .

		After equipping for the hunt at
Berbera	LOCATION	, where , very fortunately , they procured the services of
Miss Herbert	LOCATION	's uncle 's former
Shikari	LOCATION	-LRB- chief hunter -RRB- and head man , these two women -LRB- they admit being thirty years old -RRB- set out to penetrate the
Ogaden	LOCATION	country and beyond to the
Marehan	ORGANIZATION	and the Haweera districts .

		Their trip , extending over four months ' time , was signalized by exciting adventures , some comical , others serious , and one fatal -- the last being the occasion of the death of a native who was gored to death by a wounded rhinoceros .

		Miss
Herbert	PERSON	tells of this nerve-racking accident with modest recital , leaving much to the imagination of the reader , who will readily appreciate the bravery of a woman who can fearlessly meet a maddened charging rhinoceros , and kill the animal in the face of imminent danger .

		At another time .

		Miss
Herbert	PERSON	, who seems to have garnered her full share of the accidents , became lost in the dense thickets with a man-servant , and spent an anxious night amid the weird sounds and sights of an African jungle .

		Among the many interesting episodes recounted in the volume is one of a lion hunt .

		The party had just jumped a lion , which , after seriously injuring a native , crashed into the thick underbrush .

		For half an hour
Miss Herbert	PERSON	crawled through the brush , when suddenly she saw the swishing yellow tail of the animal .

		So adroitly had she made her approach that the lion neither saw nor heard her .

		At this point Miss Herbert writes : '' The air was stifling , and oh !

		how heavily I weighed on my knees !

		... I carefully got my rifle .

		It seemed a long business .

		Did I really make no noise ?

		Strange crackling rustlings sounded in miy ears , as at each g ^ owl I seized the opportunity , and in the semi-obscurity of the reverberations placed myself better .

		The lion came more into focus .

		I saw his side where it sank in , then -- farther .

		A heart - shaking second .

		My bullet was too low .

		The vast body lashed round and round .

		I seemed to see what my fate would be in another instant .

		My breath was coming in great sobs , and I wondered whether the lion was choking or I. All this was in the fraction of a moment .

		Then came my opportunity .

		His chest presented itself fair and square like a target .

		I pressed my second trigger , and threw myself backwards and went somehow as though the devil himself was after me . ''

		LuckUy for the lady , the lion was killed by the shot .

		After resigning his commission in the
Royal Field Artillery	ORGANIZATION	in
India	LOCATION	, in
1903	DATE	, Mr.
E. Crawshay Williams	PERSON	determined to return home to
England	LOCATION	by crossing
Persia	LOCATION	from sea to sea .

		In his volume entitled '' Across
Persia	LOCATION	'' he tells of his journey in a pleasant and leisurely manner .

		Sailing from
Bombay	LOCATION	, he landed at
Bushire	LOCATION	on the little island west of
Persia	LOCATION	; from
Bushire	LOCATION	he went to
Shief	LOCATION	, in
Persia	LOCATION	, the '' land of the Lion and the Sun '' -- though the lions no longer exist .

		From Shief he set out with his caravan over the monotonous waste land , stopping at some intermediate points , and came to
Dalki	LOCATION	, beautiful in coloring , with the yellow sulphur ridges , pale green hills , high pink peaks , and greenish rivers , all under the blue
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	sky .

		Passing through the mountains , the writer came to
Kazerun	LOCATION	, where he saw the first orange and pome - granate gardens ; thence he travelled to the white - stoned city of ruins ,
Sliapur	PERSON	.

		Shiraz , the city of roses and nightingales , and famous for its tombs of Hafiz and
Saadi	LOCATION	, interested our author greatly .

		The tombs of Xerxes , Artaxerxes , and
Darius II	PERSON	.

		at
Naksh-i-Rustum	ORGANIZATION	, and the burial-place of the great Cyrus at
Sivand	LOCATION	, were also visited and described at length .

		An interesting part of the book tells of a ride of two hundred and fifty miles in a victoria to
Kashan	LOCATION	, a commercial centre , and to Kum , the city of sanctity , where the
Persian Westminster Abbey	LOCATION	is situated .

		Teheran , the capital , is described as a
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 107 city where East and West meet -- the bazaars of the
East	LOCATION	and the tram-lines of the
West	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Williams	PERSON	left
Teheran	LOCATION	and
Persia	LOCATION	by caravan .

		Like all travellers in
Persia	LOCATION	, he comments on the short - comings of the Persian -- especially his disregard for the truth , his dislike of work , and his propensi - ties for thieving .

		Yet notwithstanding these defi - ciencies , Mr.
Williams	PERSON	says a kind word for the Persian 's hospitable and companionable spirit , for his good nature , his childlike unconcern and light - heartedness .

		Mr.
Williams	PERSON	travelled , like
Stevenson	PERSON	, with the hopeful heart , and his book echoes the same spirit .

		For these reasons his traveller 's tale has charm and serenity .

		Picture and text are mutually helpful and interesting to the reader .

		Very different from Mr.
Williams	PERSON	's scholarly work is the volume entitled `` Queer Things about
Persia	LOCATION	. ''

		The authors of this correctly named book ,
M. Eustache de Lorey	ORGANIZATION	and Mr.
Douglas Sladen	PERSON	-LRB- the latter the author of a similarly titled book about
Japan	LOCATION	-RRB- , wi'ote the volume by an unusual method of collaboration .


M. Lorey	PERSON	, for two years an attacM to the French Legation at
Teheran	LOCATION	, furnished the materials and the experience for the book , and Mr.
Sladen	PERSON	, who has never been in
Persia	LOCATION	, wrote down the chapters from dictation .

		Yet this queer collabo - ration about queer things in
Persia	LOCATION	has not impaired the interest of the story .


Persia	LOCATION	, however , does not mean all
Persia	LOCATION	, -- it means -LRB- as
Paris	LOCATION	is
France	LOCATION	to all Parisians -RRB-
Teheran	LOCATION	, the capital of
Persia	LOCATION	; and
Teheran	LOCATION	spells , for the most part , the bazaars -LRB- five chapters are given to this topic -RRB- , the palace of the
King of Kings	ORGANIZATION	, the
Shah	PERSON	, the harems , the Persian women , Persian politics and religion .

		A catalogue of the many topics treated would much resemble the extravagances of an Arabian Nights ' tale .

		Mystic
Persia	LOCATION	, with its conglomeration of dancers , gamblers , dervishes , banquets , spices , wines , nightingales , weddings , divorces , polygamy , religious fanaticisms , astrology , superstition , lies and thefts , street dogs , hashish-smoking , and a thousand other queer things , are all presented in such colors and with such high lights that they almost form a worthy com - panion piece to the immortal Arabian tales read in our childhood .

		This is the sort of book which will appeal to the casual reader of books of travel , and it will not be uninteresting even to the well-read student of Persian life and manners .

		Notwithstanding the proximity of the
United States	LOCATION	to
South America	LOCATION	, and in spite of the ostentatious paternalism manifested in the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	, we as a people have only the vaguest con - ception of our sister continent on the
Equator	LOCATION	.

		England and
Germany	LOCATION	, on the other hand , are not so hazy in their perceptions of the great commercial and industrial possibilities of that naturally rich country .

		Dr.
Albert Hale	PERSON	, in his book entitled `` The South Americans , '' with the additional nota - tion on the title-page , `` The Story of the
South American Republics	ORGANIZATION	, their Characteristics , Progress , and Tendencies ; with Special Reference to their Commercial Relations with the
United States	LOCATION	, '' seeks to arouse our dormant paternalism into some definite activity which will bring our land a commensurate share of South American riches .

		The situation is verjs simply stated by Dr.
Hale	PERSON	: '' The nations of
Europe	LOCATION	are crowded and
South America	LOCATION	offers the only available land on earth into which the surplus can overflow . ''

		Omitting the coast-line and the
Orinoco	LOCATION	valley of Vene - zuela , the sug-ar country and the
Amazon Valley of Brazil	LOCATION	, and the upper reaches of the
ParanA	LOCATION	and
Paraguay	LOCATION	in
Argentina	LOCATION	, the remaining area , vast as it is and lying partly within the tropics or mountain snows , is as capable of sup - porting the white man as the
United States	LOCATION	or
Canada	LOCATION	. ''

		Dr.
Hale	PERSON	discusses the productive possibilities of
South America	LOCATION	in a very thorough-going manner .

		He presents , in a plain matter-of-fact way , the inter - esting and often exciting history of the principal South American States , outlines their leading geo - graphical features , discusses their local governments and foreign relationships , and analyzes their social and mental life .

		No recent book on
South America	LOCATION	is so well adapted to the needs of the general reader as is this one .

		Its make-up and illustrations are particularly pleasing .

		Another interesting and timely book on a South American subject is '' The Andes and the
Amazon	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
C. Reginald Enock	PERSON	.

		Ancient Peruvians re - sented the Spanish marauder who sacked their treasures , but modern Peruvians long for commerce , the new buccaneer , to open the desert places of her wealth and to exploit her natural advantages to the world .

		In some measure Mr.
Enock	PERSON	does adver - tise the natural wealth of
Peru	LOCATION	, but he does not neglect the story of her ancient days .

		He crossed the country from the west to the east , over the burning yellow sands , climbing the snow-covered peaks to visit the ancient habitations of a race remembered in story , and thence passed down into the fertile valleys and forests of the
Amazon	LOCATION	and the
Maranon	LOCATION	.

		His rovings were conducted in such a hearty spirit , with such a commendable leisure , and are written down in such a pleasing manner , that his book adds much to our rapidly accumulating library on South American affairs .

		Had the author , however , depended more on his kodak and less on his ill-drawn pictures of many scenes , his book would have gained in attractiveness .

		Notwithstanding the fact that the automobile is now in the dull catalogue of common things , and that , in consequence , our hastening days fly on in full career , we are not likely to associate the '' gran huon macchina '' with the glories of Italian art .

		Yet this is exactly what Mr.
Dan Fellows Piatt	PERSON	has done ; and he has associated the two without any violent shock to our artistic or nervous temperament .

		His volume entitled `` Through
Italy	LOCATION	with Car and Camera '' tells of his pilgi'image last year , from early
October	DATE	to late
January	DATE	, to more than four-score Italian towns and cities .

		Mr.
Piatt	PERSON	's primary pur - pose was to make a general review of Italian art , espe - cially of Italian pictures .

		Over two hundred excellent reproductions , most of them of paintings , attest that his camera served him as well as did his motor-car .

		108 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, Of the mere trip the author displays a commendable consideration in not subjecting the reader who enjoys art more than motoring to an extended recital of the haps and mishaps of the machine ; nor does he g6 too deeply into detail in his raptures about the scenery -- a truly commendable reserve ; but with that touch - and-go spirit which the motor-car encourages , and the Italian scenery in the latter part of the year intensifies , he devotes his energies to the criticism of art .

		As a critic of art Mr.
Piatt	PERSON	is by no means commonplace and conventional .

		He does , indeed , cast down some of the ancient idols , but he is not a destroyer of all the cherished images .

		He is thank - ful , for instance , that
Raphael	PERSON	did not live ten years longer . ''

		I dread to think what the art of the great genius would have degenerated into by that time .

		Superlative facility dethrones
Raphael	PERSON	.

		Greatest of draughtsmen , his popularity lessened his inspiration .

		His reputation will grow less with the centuries .

		However great his powers , his pictures proclaim that longer life would not have made him the equal of
Michael Angelo	PERSON	, Titian or Velasquez . ''

		We need not argue with Mr.
Piatt	PERSON	in regard to his criticism , but we may commend his temperate expression on so radical a theory .

		As we glance over the many pic - tures in the volume , and as we study the road-map , we are inclined to say that Mr.
Piatt	PERSON	has made an ideal trip in an ideal way , and that his book is worthy of the pilgrimage .


H. E. Coblektz	PERSON	.

		Briefs on New Books .

		The latest ^ ^ '
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	has written a biographer volume on
Henrik Ibsen	PERSON	for the of ibseti .

		series of biographies called '' Literary Lives , '' published by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	is entitled to write upon this sub - ject because of his life-long interest in
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's work , and because it was he who first gave any account of that work to the English public .

		Moreover , writing at the present date , he has the advantage over pre - vious biographers in being able to make use of the Ibsen letters , and the other biographical and remin - iscential matter that has appeared since the drama - tist 's death .

		There is a great deal of this material altogether , and Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	has made good use of it .

		But in spite of these advantages , he has by no means , as he seems to think , made '' obsolete '' the standard biography of Ibsen by
Henrik Jaeger	PERSON	.

		That solid performance is likely to outlast many such books as the one Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	has given us , agreeable and informing as it is , and it hardly becomes him to belittle a work which is so much more searching and philosophical than his own .

		One passage in the present volume may be quoted as indicative of the sanity of the writer 's general conception of his sub - ject .

		The '' obsession of the critic to discover problems in the work of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	has been one of the main causes of that impatience and even downright injustice with which his writings have been received by a large section of those readers who should nat - urally have enjoyed them .

		He is a poet , of fantastic wit and often reckless imagination , and he has been travestied in a long black coat and white choker , as if he were an embodiment of the Nonconformist conscience . ''

		This stricture upon a great deal of current Ibsen criticism is essentially just , and Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	is careful not to err in the same sense .

		Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	also remembers that he is writing for English readers , who know next to nothing of the intellectual antecedents and environment of a Scandinavian man of letters , and his book has the meritorious quality of explaining these influences , most of which are taken for granted by
Jaeger	PERSON	, as they naturally would be by any biographer of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's own race .

		On one small point we can supply the writer with a bit of information that should interest him .

		He says that the famous narrative poem , ''
Terje Vigen	PERSON	, '' '' will never be translated successfully into English . ''

		But it has been translated , with remarkable success , by Mr.
Percy W. Shedd	PERSON	, and the version may be found in his volume of poems entitled '' The Oceanides '' published about six years ago .

		In connection with these comments upon the latest of Ibsen biographies we may record the fact that the eleven-volume edi - tion of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's plays , prepared under the supervision of Mr.
William Archer	PERSON	, has at last been completed .

		The volume which now fills the set is noteworthy for including Professor
C. H. Herford	PERSON	's version of * ' Love 's Comedy , '' which is only less remarkable than the same translator 's version of '' Brand . ''

		These two works , in their English form , are so vastly superior to the Archer translations in whose company they are included that they constitute a class by themselves .

		Further The new edition of Mr.
W. S. meBurbank Harwood	PERSON	's '' New Creations in Plant gardens .

		Life '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- consists in bring - ing to the earlier volume with the same title two new chapters designed to give the reader more perfect knowledge of '' spineless '' cacti ,
Carnegie	ORGANIZATION	subventions , and new horticultural experiments , and in general to bring the history of the '' acts '' of Mr.
Burbank	PERSON	down to date .

		In these chapters , the same florid and inflated style , the same extravagance of statement , which have marked all of Mr.
Harwood	PERSON	's writing , still appear .

		The more is the pity ; for Mr.
Burbank	PERSON	has really done some very good work , and his services to
California	LOCATION	and to the world should not be rendered ridiculous by bombast and over-praise .

		Our author seems to ignore entirely the fact that there have been other gardeners in the world , that there are other countries than
California	LOCATION	, and other fruits than those originating in
Santa Rosa	LOCATION	.

		Even the vaunted cactus as presented here is made to play a role of extreme uncertainty .

		Surprising as it may seem , a cactus is nevertheless , in all that goes to make up vegetation , exactly like any other green plant .

		It must have light , it must have water and food of various sorts .

		The cactus differs from its congeners chiefly in that it can retain for a long
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAl ^ 109 time water once absorbed .

		No cactus can live without water , much less create it .

		The cactus can endure drouth ; it can stand on the desert and wait for rain , store the rain when it comes , using it slowly and waiting for the rain to come again ; but the amount and rapidity of growth for the cactus , as for any other green plant , depends upon the amount of food and water it can secure .

		It is said that ninety-five per cent of the cactus produced at
Santa Rosa	LOCATION	is water .

		Probably so ; but such an amount of water absorbed by the cactus indicates an amoimt of rainfall far in excess of that of an ordinary desert ; so that even if we have in the spineless cactus a plant suitable for forage , the chances that it may ever occupy the desert are simply those of successful irrigation -- nothing more .

		It is claimed at
Santa Rosa	LOCATION	that in the newly '' created '' cacti , dwellers in the desert are to find a new and unfailing food supply .

		New it would no doubt be , but unfailing , even if acceptable , is more than doubtful .

		Hungry humanity is likely long to go hungry still , or ever it find in tuna roasts and opuntia puddings the relief from starva - tion which Mr.
Harwood	PERSON	's enthusiasm would point out to `` those who live where famine stalks . ''

		It were to be hoped that the new relations in which Mr.
Burbank	PERSON	stands with the
Carnegie	ORGANIZATION	foundation would at length give to the world a reasonable and credible scientific account of what is actually being accomplished in these present-day gardens of Hesperis .

		As said at the outset , Mr.
Burbank	PERSON	has really done some good work , but the critical reader of '' New Creations in Plant Life '' will be stiU un - certain both as to its amount and kind .


Commencement University	ORGANIZATION	and college addresses are addresses of beginning to take up a rather large the right sort .

		gp ^ ge on the library shelf .

		One of the latest volumes to reach our hand embodies the counsel of Dr.
Albert Shaw	PERSON	to various student bodies , and bears as its title '' The Outlook for the Average Man '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Any address at a commence - ment or similar occasion is bound to be optimistic , so we may merely pray that the optimism will be sane and sanely presented .

		As we should expect , our prayer is fulfilled in the case of Dr.
Shaw	PERSON	.

		He does not blink the existence of tremendous social and economic problems ; but he bids the young man face them hopefully , '' believing in our people , our country , our institutions . ''

		On capitalism and materialism we shall see reared the stately structure of a higher civilization .

		In the process we need not shrink from realities : the man who offers the farmer an effective commercial fertilizer to spread on his fields '' is a veritable angel for the spread of sweetness and light . '' ''

		There is as much room for the delightful play of the faculty of imagination in the successful conduct of a soap business as in writing poetry . ''

		The forceful words of this last sentence , however , are slightly misleading if taken by themselves ; for our speaker does look eagerly and hopefully beyond the material soap factory to the ultimately more satisfying bubbles of idealism .

		The latest half dozen volumes similar to the present work compel an older man to think of the change from the commencement address as it flourished thirty years ago .

		To-day the young man does not hear so much about '' hitch - ing his wagon to a star , '' and a great deal more about '' whether a college education pays . ''

		It is true that the speakers invariably conclude that education does pay , and always introduce a little savor of the ideal ; but the change is very striking , and , to some of us at least , not altogether comforting .

		When all is said and done the wagon and the star had something final on their side .

		To return to Dr.
Shaw	PERSON	, we may say that his volume , although frankly remaining a series of talks rather than a book , has more unity than most collections of this sort ; and that it is hopeful and helpful .

		His methods of expression are too well known to need comment ; but in one paragraph we seemed to feel in our heart an old-fashioned craving for shall instead of wUl .

		The arrangement of the printed page , with its marginal summaries , is a real boon to the busy reading eye .

		A short ^ ^ - ^ ' ^ -
Matthews	PERSON	's little book treatise on a on `` The Principles of Intellectual imve theme .

		Education '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- shows that the writer is thoroughly familiar with the ideas of both of the great German schools of pedagogy , -- the outgoing activity emphasized by
Froebel	PERSON	, and the inworking of the world upon the growing mind which is the foundation of
Herbart	ORGANIZATION	's doctrine .

		The very fact that one could not well say that the author leans distinctly to either side shows that he is not a slavish follower but a self-respecting thinker .

		To most readers , the most interesting chapter will be that on the study of foreign languages .

		Four lan - guages are in the field -LRB- for the English school -RRB- ,
Latin	LOCATION	, Greek , French , and German .

		The author argues cogently for a modern rather than an ancient language to be studied first ; then , rather to our surprise , for German in preference to French ; finally , to our great satisfaction , for Greek in prefer - ence to
Latin	LOCATION	.

		Space does not permit any extended report of his arguments : they are well worth the attention of teachers , especially those on the literary side of the currictilum .

		Not a few ancient super - stitions are demolished by the reasoning en route ; for example , the supposititious value of the complexity of Latin : `` If this argument is to be pressed , we may as well adopt the most complicated language that can be found -- Russian , perhaps , or at all events Greek '' -LRB- p. 83 -RRB- .

		Old `` formal discipline '' is hardly used : '' To regard , as some have done , the learning of the first declension as of inestimable value in itself -- what is this but to talk sheer nonsense ? ''

		-LRB- p. 83 -RRB- .

		It is good to find even an English writer discarding the use of the term '' humanities '' to denote the classic literatures and languages -- a usage which has been abolished by the progress of the world and should be abandoned by thoughtful persons .

		The humanities are of course what they always were -- literature , history , biography , and 110 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, what Mr.
Matthews	PERSON	calls '' geographical history or historical geography . ''

		To the vast majority to-day , and doubtless to the increasing majority , these sub - jects are revealed through the vernacular , not through any learned tongue .

		For the child , our author wisely advises , biography is the true form of humanistic culture .

		To teachers of English literature in all climes his parable from ''
Alice	PERSON	in
Wonderland	LOCATION	'' is to be commended : ' '' I am so hot and thirsty , ' says
Alice	PERSON	. '

		I know what you 'd like , ' the Queen said good-naturedly . '

		Have a biscuit ? ' ''

		The book has yet one merit that is far too rare in these days : it is delightfully short -- only a hundred and thirty pages ; one actually is sorry there is not more of it , and what greater compliment than this can be paid to a book on a serious subject ?

		, The great interest in eartliquakes their causes which was awakened m this country and results . -RSB-

		^ y ^ j ^ g g ^ n Francisco disaster more than justifies the new work on this subject by Pro- fessor
William Herbert Hobbs	PERSON	, of the
Department of Geology	ORGANIZATION	in the
University of Michigan	ORGANIZATION	.

		The rate of progress of seismology at the present time is very rapid .

		Old ideas are being exploded , and new theories are coming to the front .

		The relations of our geological knowledge of the structure of the earth 's crust to the location of areas subject to frequent earthquakes are being better understood .

		To various phases of the subject the author has already contributed several scientific monographs , but in the present work he displays signal ability in popularizing the results of scientific inquiry .

		No intelligent layman can look at this book without being interested , or can read it without substantial gain in knowledge .

		After a brief historical review of earthquake theories from the times of the Greek philosophers downward , the author devotes half a dozen chapters to present-day explanations of the causes of these disturbances , and the broad lines of their results as manifested in the changes wrought upon the earth 's surface .

		The much neglected topic of the influence of seismic disturbances upon the flow of streams -- above ground and subterranean -- receives due attention .

		Four chapters are devoted to accoimts of great earthquakes , from that which destroyed
Lisbon	LOCATION	in 1 755 down to the catastrophes at
San Francisco	LOCATION	and
Kingston	LOCATION	.

		Sea-quakes receive brief mention .

		The various forms of instruments for measuring the magnitude and form of earth tremors are described , and the earth autographs which they give are interpreted .

		The book is finely illustrated with twenty-four full-page plates and one hundred and twelve text illustrations .

		Among the desiderata of literary the history history enumerated by the late of couture .


Ferdinand Brunetiere	PERSON	was a history of the study of the classics in all ages and countries .

		This want has now been met , and the partial or sketchy treatises of Grafenhan ,
Heeren	LOCATION	, Bursian , and more recently Gudeman , have been in large measure superseded for English readers by Dr.
Sandys	PERSON	's '' History of Classical Scholarship '' -LRB- Cam - bridge
University Press	ORGANIZATION	;
New York	LOCATION	: Putnam -RRB- , of which the second edition of the first volume now appears , revised and enlarged from 672 to 702 pages .

		The much anticipated second volume , which will continue the history from the end of the
Middle Ages	LOCATION	through the Renaissance down to the present day , is announced as in the press .

		The whole will constitute an indispensable work of reference , and for serious readers a readable chapter in the general history of civilization and culture .

		For its classical scholarship is no small part of the culture of the most scientific and modern century , and for such periods as the Renaissance and Middle Ages it is the foundation and presupposition of the whole .

		Dr.
Sandys	PERSON	, who in his leisure hours is '' Public Orator in the
University of Cambridge	ORGANIZATION	, '' had already , in his edition of
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	's Politeia , shown his skill in the compilation and presentation in serviceable shape of great collections of facts .

		The present work exhibits on a larger scale his happy combina - tion of English sanity and German erudition .

		To summarize or criticise this vast mass of detail would be obviously impossible , and to single out some iso - lated point for animadversion and dissent is obvi - ously unfair .

		Suffice it to say that the work , parallel but not identical in theme with Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	's '' History of Criticism , '' though it still leaves open the great subject of the influence of the classics in other literatures , more than fulfils the promise of its title .

		It is for many periods virtually a history of literature from a special point of view .

		The entire literatures of
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	are surveyed in the endeavor to bring out everything of critical or philological significance .

		And the biblio - graphies , the chapter and verse citations in the foot-notes , the chronological tables , the illustrations , and the fuU index , combine to make this one of the most valuable works of ready reference upon the scholar 's shelf .

		, Mrs.
Annie Russell Marble	PERSON	believes American that our literary pioneers deserve a literature .

		share of the attention that we are bestowing so generously upon the soldiers and states - men who were their contemporaries .

		Their work , she admits , was often immature and crude , but it helped to establish literary standards , and its ser - vices in shaping our government and in encourag - ing our industries and our educational system were invaluable .

		And if the poems , plays , novels , and pamphlets of these early writers make dull reading to-day , their lives are generally eventful and interest - ing enough to repay study .

		Professor

Revolu	PERSON	- tionary literature .

William Dunlop	PERSON	, and

		It wiU be noticed that all these writers , unlike the diarists and statesmen who pre - ceded them and whose contribution to literature was purely occasional , produced more or less professional work .

		Together they make up the epoch of transi - tion which was speedily to mature in the work of

Miss Cipriani	ORGANIZATION	tells in `` A Tuscan Childhood '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- might seem little out of the ordinary to Italian readers , but to Americans it has the interest of constantly suggested contrast .

		Would it be possible to impose the system of the Cipriani household on American children ?

		and if so , what would be the result ?

		This system divided the family of seven into two mutually exclusive groups , prescribed with almost military exactness the hours for the activities of each group , and forbade asking questions , making complaints , or speaking to strangers .

		But there were intellectual liberties to match material restraints .

		From English nurses and German governesses and tutors the children learned to speak four languages by the time they were seven years old , and acquired a cosmopolitan store of ideas .

		They walked and travelled and read , and were cultivated far beyond American children of equal age .

		Miss
Cipriani	PERSON	's story is told with delightful simplicity , and with little attempt at the child-study method .

		With gen - erosity and good literary judgment she shares the place of leading character with her mother , whose early life was even more interesting than her own .

		The book has an attractively pictured cover , but otherwise is without illustrations .

		The ''
Urne	PERSON	- Buriall '' in Probably there are not many nowa - days who read `` that wonderful sumptuous dress , bo ^ k , '' as
Walter Pater	PERSON	called it , -- the '' Hydriotaphia , or Urne-Buriall . ''

		But even were their number fewer than it is , the sumptuous reprint just issued from the
Riverside Press	ORGANIZATION	would not lack for welcome , as the edition of less than four hundred copies should be all too small to satisfy those who will covet the volume for the sake of its beautiful externals .

		The book is a thin quarto , printed on handmade paper from the ''
Brimmer	PERSON	'' type , with marginal notes in italics .

		As in all the
Riverside Press	ORGANIZATION	editions , typography and presswork are faultless .

		A wood-engraved title-page by Mr.
M. Lament Brown	PERSON	, and an elaborately-stamped cover of crimson leather , are pleasing decorative features .

		Certainly Sir
Thomas Browne	PERSON	's cheerless but elo - quent classic has never received a worthier setting , nor is it likely to hereafter .

		It should be said that the text , with some slight modifications , follows that of the first edition , printed in
1658	DATE	.

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Messrs.
E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have just published a new and cheaper edition of Miss
Gertrude Lowthian Bell	PERSON	's ''
Syria	LOCATION	: the Desert and the Sown . ''

		The many illus - trations from photographs which appeared in the first issue of the book are reproduced , and do much to stim - ulate interest in
Miss Bell	LOCATION	's account of her adventurous journey through the Holy Land .

		Since the publication , in
1900	DATE	, of '' The Life and Letters of
Phillips Brooks	PERSON	, '' an abridgement has often been called for , on the ground that many people who would like to know something of
Phillips Brooks	ORGANIZATION	have not time to read so full a biography .

		In many cases , too , the cost might be prohibitive .

		Accordingly , the author of the longer life , Dr.
Alexander V. G. Allen	PERSON	, has finally prepared a biography in the compass of one thick octavo volmne -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , aiming to present in condensed form the essentials of the great preacher 's life and the spirit of his teachings .

		Appropriate to the recent
Whittier	LOCATION	centenary cele - bration , and forming a most desirable souvenir of that occasion , is the little volume lately issued by Messrs.
Houghton	PERSON	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	containing a sketch of the poet 's life by Mr.
Bliss Perry	PERSON	, and a score of
Whittier	LOCATION	's poems illustrating the circumstances of his boyhood and the spiritual view-points of his various periods .

		Two portraits , rarely if ever before reproduced , illustrate the volume .

		Besides the regular edition , some four hundred copies have been printed on larger and better paper , with imcut edges and the portraits in photogravure .

		For those who appreciate fine book-making , this latter edition will be found well worth the difference in price .

		The latest volume in '' The Connoisseur 's Library '' -LRB- Putnams -RRB- has for its subject '' Goldsmiths ' and Silver - smiths ' Work . ''

		Mr.
Nelson Dawson	PERSON	is the author .

		His point of view differs from that of the writers of many other collectors ' manuals in that he seeks to emphasize artistic workmanship rather than the factitious values dependent upon rarity and uniqueness .

		He makes no attempt at strict classification or characterization of the collective work of any period .

		His method is rather to select representative specimens , from Etruscan and Mycensean periods down to eighteenth century English work , and to give a detailed account of the appearance and special attractions of each object .

		The result is a history of antique gold and silver work , treated from the artist 's point of view .

		There are no formal accoimts of great craftsmen , but the methods that differentiated the productions of all the old workmen from those of their successors of to-day are explained , and a plea is made for a return to the better times when the design and the execution were under the supervision , if not in the hands , of one man .

		The plates , which are photo - gravures of fine quafity , reproduce over a hundred and twenty-five articles in gold or silver , and there are other smaller illustrations in the text .

		112 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, Notes .

		The
Oliver Ditson Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish ''
Counterpoint Simpli	PERSON	- fied , '' a text-book in the elements of the subject , the work of Mr.
Francis L. York	PERSON	. ''

		The Welfare of Children '' is the title of a useful readmg list on the care of dependent children , prepared and issued by the
Brooklyn Public Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		A series of articles on the life and ministry of the late
David Swing	ORGANIZATION	has been prepared by Rev.
Joseph Newton	PERSON	, and will appear in forthcoming issues of '' Unity , '' the
Chicago	LOCATION	weekly .

		To the series entitled '' Modern Poets and Christian Teaching , '' published by
Messrs. Eaton & Mains	ORGANIZATION	, a volume on
Elizabeth Barrett Browning	PERSON	has now been added , the work of Mrs.
Martha Foote Crow	PERSON	.

		A text of '' Practical Physics , '' in two volumes , for the use of colleges and technical schools , is published by the Messrs.
Macmillan	PERSON	.

		It is the joint work of Messrs.
W. S. Franklin	PERSON	,
C. M. Crawford	PERSON	, and
Barry Macnutt	PERSON	.

		Dr.
Gfiorge M. Gould	PERSON	, of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, who knew
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	intimately , has written a volume on this strange genius , which is to be published by
George W. Jacobs & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		A complete bibliography by Mr.
Arthur Stedman	PERSON	accompanies the volume .

		The '' First Book in Latin , '' by Messrs.
A. J. Inglis	PERSON	and
Virgil Prettyman	PERSON	, is published in a second edition by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		From the same publishers we have
Stevenson	PERSON	's '' The Master of
Ballantrae	LOCATION	, '' issued as a `` Pocket Classic , '' and edited by Mr.
H. Adelbert White	PERSON	.

		In the '' Temple Greek and Latin Classics , '' pub - lished by the Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	, we have '' The Odes and Epodes of
Horace	PERSON	, '' the metrical translation by Mr.
John Marsliall	PERSON	, here printed to face the Latin text .

		There are a few notes , and there is also a biographical introduction .

		Two unusually valuable additions to the '' Studies in English '' of
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	are sent us by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		One of them is an historical account of '' The Early American Novel , '' by Miss
Lillie Deming Loshe	PERSON	; the other is a study of '' Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	as a Critic of Literature , '' by Miss
Margaret Ball	PERSON	.

		Two new volumes of Mr.
Albert F. Calvert	PERSON	's '' Spanish Series , '' published by the
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	, have for their respective subjects '' Velasquez '' and ''
Leon	PERSON	,
Burgos	PERSON	, and Salamanca . ''

		No less than 462 full-page plates are given with the latter volume , which makes us marvel more than ever at the small price set upon the books of this series .

		A series of twenty-two lectures is now in progress at
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	, in each of which some specialist describes the recent achievements and present status of his own subject .

		• These lectures are to be published as separate pamphlets at the
Columbia University Press	ORGANIZATION	, and two are now at hand : -- `` Physics , '' by Professor
E. F. Nichols	PERSON	; and '' Mathematics , '' by Professor
C. J. Keyser	PERSON	.

		The
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	pubUsh '' Who 's Who '' for
1908	DATE	, which means the sixtieth annual issue of that invaluable book of reference .

		Despite deaths , the list grows steadily longer , and now occupies well over two thou - sand pages of closely-printed matter .

		The number of American entries seems to be increasing , but we have never been able to understand the capricious principle of their selection .

		Mr.
Charles Welsh	PERSON	, compiler of the '' Golden Trea - sury of Irish Songs and Lyrics , '' has nearly ready for publication a collection of sea songs , entitled '' Songs for Sailors . ''

		While it contains many of the classic sea songs of British origin , the greater part of the anthology consists of songs inspired by events in the history of our own navy .

		Following closely upon the publication of Dr.
Horace Howard Furness	PERSON	's new volume of the
Variorum Edition of Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, `` Antony and Cleopatra , '' comes the announcement from
Lippincott	PERSON	's that another volume of this edition will be issued early in the new year .

		This will be ''
Richard III.	PERSON	, '' edited by Mr.
Horace Howard Furness , Jr.	PERSON	, and will bring the total number of volumes to sixteen .


Holger Drachmann	PERSON	, as the `` Athenseum '' tells us , is to be buried at
Skagen	LOCATION	, the fishing village that often figures in his poetry and prose .

		Here his ashes will be placed in a sandhill facing the
North Sea	LOCATION	.

		The crema - tion took place in
Copenhagen	LOCATION	, and the urn was carried with the escort of a torchlight procession to the steamer .

		The poet left several completed MSS. , including some plays and a novel .

		Promoters of school entertainments will be grateful to the Misses
Elizabeth McFadden	PERSON	and
Lilian Davis	PERSON	for their compilation of '' A Selected List of Plays for Amateurs and
Students of Dramatic Expression	ORGANIZATION	in Schools and Colleges . ''

		All interests are here repre - sented , including such special ones as plays for children , out-door plays , and Christmas plays .

		The book is obtain - able from
Miss McFadden	PERSON	, Box 328 ,
Cincinnati	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
W. J. Rolfe	PERSON	, the well-known Shakespearean scholar , recently celebrated his eightieth birthday by the completion of a new volume , entitled ^ ' Shakespeare Proverbs . ''

		The selection of proverbs , maxims , aphor - isms , and apothegms included in the forthcoming volume was originally made by Mrs.
Cowden-Clarke	PERSON	, who selected from the plays only .

		Additional selections from the sonnets and other poems of Shakespeare have been made by Dr.
Rolfe	PERSON	, who also contributes an intro - duction and notes . ''

		John Chinaman at Home '' -LRB-
Scribners	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , the Rev.
E. J. Hardy	PERSON	's lively sketches of '' Men ,
Maimers	PERSON	, and Things in
China	LOCATION	, '' has recently attained the popularity of a third edition .

		As chaplain to the British forces at
Hong Kong	LOCATION	for three years , Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	had rather unusual opportunities for observing Chinese ways ; and he was thoroughly on the alert to utilize them .

		His account of what he saw , heard , and did in
China	LOCATION	is informal , direct , and thoroughly readable .

		The photo - graphic illustrations are excellent .

		Mr.
Arthur Elson	PERSON	's ''
Music Club Programs	ORGANIZATION	from All Nations , '' published by the
Oliver Ditson Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is some - thing more of a book than its title would indicate .

		Although not a large one , it gives us , in addition to a great number of concert programmes , judiciously arranged to exhibit national traits in musical composi - tion , a number of sets of questions for class study , and a text which is a skeleton history and biographical dic - tionary of modern music .

		The illustrations are groups of portraits , and give us many modem faces that have not yet become familiar to music-lovers .

		The
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	add to their '' Gateway Series '' a volume of '' Selections from
Irvmg	ORGANIZATION	's Sketch - Book , '' edited by Professor
Martin W. Sampson	PERSON	; and '' The Autobiography of
Benjamin Franklin	PERSON	, '' edited by the late
Albert Henry Smyth	PERSON	.

		From the same publishers
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 113 we have a book on '' The Short Story , '' edited by Professor
Brander Matthews	PERSON	.

		The volume consists essentially of specimens illustrative of the development of this literary form beginning with the ''
Gesta Roman	PERSON	- orum `` and
Boccaccio	PERSON	, and coming down to living writers , three of whom are represented .

		The editor contributes some fifty pages of critical matter , which are highly interesting , both because they exhibit a man riding a hobby , and because they provide a sympathetic and penetrating study of the subject .

		Professor
Lane Cooper	PERSON	has edited a work on `` Theories of Style '' that will be found highly useful by students and teachers of literature .

		A selection from
Wacker	PERSON	- nagel on the general theory of style is placed in the forefront of the volume , and is followed by extracts from
Plato	LOCATION	,
Aristotle	LOCATION	, and
Longinus	LOCATION	, among the ancients , and from Swift ,
Buffon	LOCATION	,
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	,
Coleridge	PERSON	, De Quincey ,
Thoreau	LOCATION	,
Schopenhauer	PERSON	,
Spencer	PERSON	,
Lewes	LOCATION	,
Stevenson	PERSON	,
Pater	PERSON	, Brunetifere , and Mr.
Frederic Har	PERSON	- rison , among the moderns .

		Tliere is a select bibliog - raphy , and the extracts are provided with notes , but not enough to swamp them .

		-LRB-
Macmillau	ORGANIZATION	. -RRB-

		Several notable volumes of poetry and the drama are announced for
spring	DATE	pubhcation by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The promise of several hitherto unknown poems by
Tennyson	PERSON	, as well as of a series of his own notes on his works , is perhaps of the greatest significance .

		Then there is a new volume of poems by
Alfred Noyes	PERSON	, one of the most promising of the younger generation in
England	LOCATION	, and new dramas by
Stephen Phillips	PERSON	and
William Butler Yeats	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	has written a '' Faust '' v/hich is to be produced in
London	LOCATION	by Mr.
Beerbohm	PERSON	Tree before the close of the present season .

		Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	's new drama , '' The
Unicom	ORGANIZATION	from the Stars , '' which he wrote in collaboration with
Lady Gregory	PERSON	, has already been played in
Dublin	LOCATION	, and will be published in a volume along with ''
Kathleen Ni Houlahan	PERSON	'' and a revised edition of `` The Hour Glass . ''

		The American drama is represented by Mr.
Percy MacKaye	PERSON	, with '' The Scarecrow , '' the first prose drama from his hand to be published .

		The death of
Daniel CoUamore Heath	PERSON	, at
Newtonville Mass.	LOCATION	, on
January 29 last	DATE	, removes from the American publishing fraternity one of its oldest and most respected members , and from American public life an earnest worker for civic and national betterment .

		Bom in
1843	DATE	, Mr.
Heath	PERSON	was prepared for college at the
Nichols Latin School	ORGANIZATION	in
Lewiston	LOCATION	,
Maine	LOCATION	, and was graduated from
Amherst College	ORGANIZATION	in the class of
' 68	DATE	.

		For the next two years he was principal of the high school in
Southboro	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, and then devoted two years to study at the
Bangor Theological Seminary	ORGANIZATION	.

		Turning again to edu - cational affairs , after a year of travel abroad , he became supervisor of schools at
Farmington	LOCATION	,
Maine	LOCATION	.

		After serving in that capacity for a year he entered the book business , and in
1874	DATE	represented in
Rochester	LOCATION	,
N. Y.	PERSON	, the publishing firm of
Ginn Brothers	ORGANIZATION	.

		A year later he opened a branch house for the firm in
New York City	LOCATION	, where he remained for some months .

		In
1876	DATE	he became a member of the firm , under the title of
Ginn & Heath	ORGANIZATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	.

		This relation continued until
1886	DATE	, when he disposed of his partnership interest and started in business on his own account in educational publishing as head of the well-known house of
D. C. Heath & Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the cause of civil service reform Mr.
Heath	PERSON	did much efficient service , and he was one of those who most earnestly deplored our national impe - rialistic exploits of the past few years .

Thomas Alva Edison	PERSON	SIXTY YEARS OF AN INVENTOR 'S LIFE By
FRANCIS ARTHUR JONES	PERSON	THIS volume will at once commend itself as one of the few necessary books to librarians and readers alike .

		Edison 's name and fame are known around the world .

		His life story reads like a romance , from the time he published a newspaper on board a train at fourteen , and later was an out-at-the-elbows ' * tramp '' telegraph operator till his electrical inventions caused the formation of a fifteen million dollar stock company .

		No recent life of
Edison	ORGANIZATION	is in print , a fact which makes this book doubly valuable .

		It is the result of close acquaintance with and study of the inventor , and is at once complete , authoritative , and intensely interesting .

		It is a romance of truth which far exceeds fiction .

		139 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 140 THE MYSTERY OF MUSIC .

		What a puzzle music must be to those unfor - tunate people , stricken with spiritual cecity , to whom the art is no more than so much sound and fury , signifying nothing .

		They know that to others it constitutes a whole world of experi - ence , yet are themselves excluded from that world by an insuperable barrier .

		They must take it on faith , as the color-blind must take the rainbow and the sunset .

		If they are honest with themselves , they will admit and lament this defect of sense , accepting the unavoidable , gazing wistfully at the walls that separate them from a realm of whose glories they know from trustworthy report , but into which they may not enter .

		Sometimes they are not honest with themselves , averring the very existence of the realm to be a fable , and those who claim its franchise to be self - deluded , finding realities in what are but vain imaginings .

		They allow music to be sound , more or less agreeable , but they stoutly deny , although in the face of an overwhelming mass of testimony , that it has any spiritual meaning .

		Deaf themselves to aught beyond its direct impact upon the sense , they affect a skepticism of all hearing in others , save in their own narrow and literal interpre - tation of the term .

		This specialized form of philistinism is not uncommon , but it is rarely voiced with the frank defiance of an article that has recently come under our observation .

		In this case , the self - revelation is so naive. , the ascription of the writer 's limitations to the rest of mankind so absolute , that the instance seems worthy of mention , and may serve as a pretext for a little profitable analysis .

		Starting out with the question-begging assumption that music pro- vides '' mere sensation , '' disqualifying its votaries for '' intellectual and volitional achievements , '' the writer goes on to labor the point by such arguments as the following : `` It is no more elevating to train the ear than the taste ; to enjoy sound than to enjoy flavor . '' ''

		Enjoy - ing sound that goes into the ear is no more cultivating than enjoying lobsters that go into the stomach . '' ''

		Listening to one of
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	's sonatas is not greatly different in kind from eat - ing a beefsteak . ''

		These precious propositions 120 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, lead to the conclusion that music , being one `` of our '' surface pleasures , '' gets too much of our attention , and that `` the substantials of life should have a larger place in civilization . ''

		These substantials are specified to be '' science , philosophy , statesmanship , and practical enter - prise , '' and thus a petitio principii ends , as it began , the whole argument .

		Our attention happened to be called , just as we were occupied with this self-revelation of a partly-atrophied mind , to what
Beethoven	PERSON	said of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	after the battle of
Jena	PERSON	. ''

		What a pity that I am not acquainted with the science of war as I am with that of music .

		I woidd show myself his master . ''

		And who , knowing anything of the powerful personality that expressed itseK in the '' Eroica , '' could seriously doubt that it was entirely capable of just the sort of '' intellectual and volitional achievement '' that our writer takes for granted as being beyond the reach of the musician .

		But this illustration is only by the way .

		What we are at present concerned with doing is to point out the inade - quacy of our writer 's notion of '' the substan - tials of life . ''

		It really narrows down to science and nothing else , for the moment any element not purely intellectual enters into the case , there comes with it the possibility of a musical rela - tionship .

		The province of music is the entire emotional and spiritual life , and the intellect , although a necessary philosophical concept , is no more to be caught by itself than those equally necessary abstractions , the perfect pendulum and the economic man .

		Science comes nearest to being pure when it takes the mathematical form , but we can not forget
Kepler	PERSON	's spiritual exalta - tion in contemplation of his laws of planetary motion , and we may also recall what
Abt Vogler	PERSON	thought about the whole matter -- `` The rest may reason and welcome , 't is we mvisicians know . ''

		What are `` the substantials of life ? ''

		Science is certainly one of them , but there are at least three others , art , ethics , and religion .

		And if we allow that the one is only here and there touched with emotion , the other three are surely suffused with it through and through .

		And the relation of music to all three of them as surely needs no argument in its proof .

		For music is itself an art , it is a potent influence upon char - acter , and it is of the very essence of religion .

		To refuse it artistic rank on the plea that it is no more than an ingenious arrangement of soiind is like saying that sculpture is no more than bronze or marble , that painting is no more than canvas and pigments .

		But being as much more than sound as poetry is more than words printed in black ink upon white paper , the character of music as an art is beyond cavil , and any liken - ing of its effect to that of food upon the palate is supremely ridiculous .

		There are many , indeed , who woidd go so far as to call it the highest of the arts , holding with Pater that every other art '' constantly aspires towards the con - dition of music , '' which is '' the true type or measure of perfected art . ''

		There is so much to say upon the subject of music as an ethical agency , as an influence upon conduct and character , that we hardly know where to begin .

		The few who would deny that influence have nothing more than their negative opinion to oppose to an overwhelming mass of positive testimony .

		The number of people who , interrogating their own consciousness , are pre - pared to assert that music has been a power for good in their lives , offers a crushing refutation to the skeptic , who in his very statement of denial puts himself in the class of the defectives .

		If a man declares that he has been stimulated by the masterpieces of
Bach	PERSON	and
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	to worthier endeavor and a more strenuous pur - pose , that his better nature has been awakened , his altruism broadened , and his wiU strength - ened , by communion with the great tone-artists , he would be a rash person indeed who should gainsay that evidence , or pronounce it to be self-delusion .

		A man generally knows what elements have counted in his own spiritual up - building , and has a fair notion of the extent to which they have reacted upon his dealings with his fellow-men ; it would be the height of im - pudence for one of those fellow-men to inform him that he was entirely mistaken , and that what he knew by the immediate testimony of consciousness to have been a directive force in his life had really been nothing of the sort , but only an ineffectual titillation of the sense of hearing .

		When argument runs counter to intui - tion , it is not the latter that suffers rout .

		We are not now particularly concerned with such matters as the influence of march and dance rhythms upon the sensitive mind , or even with the heightening of energy that results from the stimulus of martial music .

		These are mat - ters that hang only upon the outskirts of our central theme , and that have but little bearing upon its elucidation .

		The true influence of music upon character and conduct strikes far deeper than this , and is not illustrated in any typical fashion by '' Blue Danube '' and '' Racoc ` zy '' and '' Marseillaise '' examples .

		It is a subtle and profoxmd influence , working at
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 121 the very roots of the soul 's growth , and building up from below and within the structure of our higher spiritual life .

		If we are to take illustra - tive examples at all , we should seek them in such works as the '' Tannhauser '' and '' Parsifal '' overtures , the C Major Symphony of Schubert and the
C Minor Symphony of Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	.

		As compared with the uplifting potency of such works as these , the most consecrated prescriptive moralizing seems feeble , the most pithy ethical precept seems indirect .

		K the philosophers are right when they urge that sympathy is the foundation of the moral life , what more remains to be said in behalf of music as an effective influence upon conduct ?

		Much more might be said in detail , but every instance adduced would lead us back to that basic principle .

		The great composer , beyond any other artist , takes us into his intimacy , imparts to us the contagion of his spirit , and permits us to share in his own most exalted moods .

		His tenderness , his indignation , his brooding griefs , his ecstatic raptures , his all - embracing love become ours also .

		And while we are under his speU our petty personalities are merged in his larger nature , our vexing ripples are lost in the sweep of his emotional tides .

		Yet it is not so much the effacement of personality that we attain to as the sense of enlargement , of a new light which reveals our private perplexity as but part of a harmonious scheme of things entire , and which makes us exclaim in wonder at the penetrative sympathy that can thus reach into the inmost soul , noting each '' Separate wave , and to what sea Its difficult eddies labour in the ground . ''

		Surely it can not be urged with any show of reason that these moments , fleeting though they be , in which we live a richer and more generous life than is normally ours , pass away and leave no permanent mark upon us .

		Music is no drowsy syrup lulling us into forgetfulness , but rather a source of renewed strength and greater fortitude to bear the bur - dens of our lot .

		Tranquillizing though it may seem , and conducive to the passive attitude , it is all the time stirring hidden springs of activity within us , and the extent to which we thus react is the true measure of its power .

		Its ministry may be that of an anodyne for sorrow , but it is also far more , for it performs the Aristotelian function of katharsis no less effectively than does the art of the poet .

		Tschaikowsky 's * ' Pathetic Symphony '' is a work of the same order of magnitude as
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's '' Othello , '' and exerts the same sort of influence ; for the one work , like the other , purges the soul of terror and pity by bringing it to contemplate those emotions in an ideal embodiment and under the species of eternity .

		And the '' sud - den music of pure peace '' that sealed the three - fold song of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's vision seals also the
St. Matthew Passion of Bach	ORGANIZATION	, and the
Choral Symphony of Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	, and the closing rap - tures of '' Tristan und Isolde '' and the ''
Gotter	PERSON	- dammerung , '' for to the spiritual eye the visions thus vouchsafed are revelations no less divine than that of the
Rose of Paradise	ORGANIZATION	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		French journalistic enterprise lags so far behind American that the editor-in-chief of Le Matin ,
M. Stephane Lauzanne	PERSON	, has come to this country to study our newspaper methods with a view to waking up his own newspaper a little earlier in the
morning	TIME	-- although he does not thus paronomastically express his purpose .

		The French daily , printed to-day , dated to-morrow , and giving the news of yesterday , is cer - tainly less wide-awake than the sheet in which , upon
M. Lauzanne	PERSON	's arrival at his hotel in
New York	LOCATION	, he was astonished to behold his own photograph , the report of an interview with him `` down the harbor , '' and an account of his first impressions of
America	LOCATION	. ''

		How you do that is just what I have come here to find out , '' he explained . ''

		In the offices of Le Matin I think we have all the machinery you have in newspaper offices in
America	LOCATION	.

		We have linotypes ; we have big American rotary presses ; it is the rapidity of doing things that we have not yet acquired .

		We have what I should call the outillage , but we must have the oil to put in it to make it go quickly . ''

		He said further : '' In
Paris	LOCATION	we have a big staff of reporters , but French reporters are apt to talk much , and discussions take a long time . ''

		He expressed amazement at the activity of our people , noted their unhesitating directness of purpose , and commented admiringly on the brightness of our skies and our free - dom from smoke and fog . ''

		New York people seem much livelier than Londoners , '' he declared . ''

		Dullness and Americans do not seem to go together . ''

		This last reminds one of the late Dean Hole 's perplexed surprise at finding the sharpest people in the world using the dullest knives at table .

		Time is too precious with us to be employed in scouring steel cutlery .

		It is to be hoped that in our French visitor 's proposed two months ' study of American journalism , he will let the yellow variety serve as a warning , not as an example .

		Then dined at the club , and rushed off to the Chronicle office , where I worked from eight to eleven doing half a column on Christmas cards , three notes , and two leaders , one of which was on a book I had to look through .

		I left the office when the clock was striking eleven .

		I did not get any sleep till nearly three in the

		One would think not .

		The wonder is that , with these scrambling methods , he earned the reputation of having helped to make journal - ism literature .

		.

		, , The universities and the magazines are made the subject of a half-playf id comparison in the course of Dr.
William James	PERSON	's recent article on `` The Social Value of the College-Bred . ''

		After declaring that the best single phrase to express the purpose of the higher education is tliat '' it shoiild enable us to know a good man when we see him '' -- the word `` good '' being used in its broadest sense -- the writer takes occasion to add : '' In our essential function of indicating the better men , we now have formidable competitors outside -LSB- the col - leges and universities -RSB- . ''

		A number of these competi - tors , wide-awak e American periodicals , are then named , after which comes this suggestive passage : '' It would be a pity if any future historian were to have to write words like these : * By the middle of the twentieth cen - tury the higher institutions of learning had lost all influence over public opinion in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		But the mission of raising the tone of democracy , which they had proved themselves so lamentably unfitted to exert , was assumed with rare enthusiam and prosecuted with extraordinary skill and success by a new educational power ; and for the claiification of their human sympa - thies and elevation of their human preferences , the people at large acquired the habit of resorting exclu - sively to the guidance of certain private literary adven - tures , commonly designated in the market by the affectionate name of ten-cent magazines . ' ''

		The public library has long been regarded as the people 's imiversity ; is it possible that the monthly magazine will ever qualify itself , or is even now beginning to qualify itself , seriously to dispute with the library the right to that title ?

		Stranger things have happened .

		How PUBLIC LIBRARY FUNDS ARE SPENT is a ques - tion touching the public pocket and havmg a general interest .

		The Secretary of the American Library Asso - ciation has brought this matter to the attention of the
United States Commissioner of Education	ORGANIZATION	by recom - mending that in the next government report on public libraries there be included in the statistical tables figures showing what proportion of each library 's expenditure is devoted to -LRB- a -RRB- books , periodicals , and binding , -LRB- b -RRB- salaries , and -LRB- c -RRB- other purposes .

		It is also urged that there be added to the report a digest of the library laws of the several states , this information being at present of a scattered and not easily obtainable sort , but especially necessary to those engaged in the work of library exten - sion .

		Finally , request is made that , in view of the rapid development of state , county , city , and proprietary travel - ling library systems , a separate statistical table be given , showing date of formation , headquarters , source of sup - port , annual expenditure , number of books , circulation , etc. , of all such library systems throughout the country .

		Serious consideration of these and any other similar suggestions is promised by the
Commissioner of Educa	ORGANIZATION	- tion .

		Of much practical value would it be to have at hand figures and other information tending to show just what apportionment of a library 's income is likely to insure a maximum of usefidness , although no hard and fast rule could be laid down for all times and all places . ''

		• • The idealist in practical affairs is not always so comically helpless as the traditional German pro- fessor confronted with the commonplace reahties of daily life .

		Indeed , one likes to believe , and not seldom sees convincing reason to believe , with
Plato	PERSON	, that only the man of pure and liigh ideals is truly wise and efficient in the ordering of the humble but necessary details of mundane existence .

		The pursuit of literature and a participation in practical polities have often been proved to be not incompatible .

		The many instances in modern times of English and French statesmen who have also been distinguished as authors , need not here be cited .

		Coming nearer home , we find some recent and interesting examples of the man of letters combined with the political reformer .

		The poet-mayor of
San Francisco	LOCATION	has won national fame for himself ; Mr.
Winston Churchill	PERSON	attracted much attention by fighting corrupt railroad influence in
New Hampshire	LOCATION	; Mr.
Booth Tarkington	PERSON	tore himself from the charms of romance-writing to represent his district in the
Indiana	LOCATION	legislature ; and now Mr.
Owen Wister	PERSON	, moved with a laudable desire to purify the political atmosphere of that Sodom of mimicipal corruption that claims him as a citizen , offers himself as candidate for the upper cham - ber of the city 's legislative body .

		It is an Augean stable that waits to be cleaned , but Mr.
Wister	PERSON	is young and vigorous , both in mind and body .

		Coins that will always pass current , in liter - ature if not in the market , are those obsolescent pieces , dear to readers of romance and poetry and drama , -- the pistole , the noble , the ducat -LRB- '' My daughter !

		O my ducats !

		O my daughter !

		O my Christian ducats ! '' -RRB-

		the groschen , the piece of eight , and many others .

		We have but the vaguest notion of the value of any of these coins when we meet with them in oxu - literary wander - ings , and therein lies lialf their charm : they lend them - selves so beautifully to the pui-poses of the imagination , they convey so little suggestion of real cash , of '' filthy lucre , '' and yet their pm-chasing power is so splendidly unlimited .

		Into this treasury of untainted money has recently passed the historic German thaler : on the first of
October	DATE	it ceased to be recognized as a coin of the Empire , and henceforth its currency is limited , or rather extended , to the larger empire of letters .

		Joachimsthal and the coin there first minted -LRB- in

Count Zaluski	LOCATION	, which was said to contain 260,000 volumes and 10,000 manuscripts .

The Hispanic Society	ORGANIZATION	's library and museum were opened to the public a few weeks ago .

		It can not undertake to become so completely , since it has neither the space to accommodate the pending material nor the free service with which to handle it ; but within its space and means it has no scruple in utilizing its own duplicates to strengthen well-administered libraries else - where . ''

		Increased facilities for this work are certainly to be desired .

		... The per capita supply of public library books , which used to be greater in
Boston	LOCATION	than anywhere else , now reaches its maximum in
Springfield	LOCATION	, if recently published statistics are to be trusted .

		That the honor of thus most generously providing for the citizen 's intel - lectual needs still remains in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, is not a surprising revelation , nor , to some of us , an altogether displeasing one .

		In the matter of open-handed financial support of her public library , the city of the three hills still holds the supremacy , as shown by tax receipts , city census , and library appropriation .

		Thinness , airiness , and insubstantiality are sometimes beautiful and wholly desirable qualities -- in angels , for instance .

		Bulkiness and beefiness do not embody all virtues .

		With a handsome building centrally situated , and a good-sized collection of books for general circulation , besides possessing means for reasonably rapid additions , the institution should have made a better showing than was revealed in the report of three years ago .

		That the powers in control thought so also , is made evident by the contrast between that report and the one for the year just closed .

		Brains will tell , in affairs of public service no less than in private business enterprise .

		It will be a history of the world , composed of choice extracts from all the great historians .

		Think how
Charles Lamb	PERSON	would have delighted to read through this encyclopaedic work from page one to page seventeen thousand !

Byles	PERSON	and the prettiness of his daughters , who , of course , were the envy of those who could not aspire to be talked to by English noblemen .

		Moreover , Lord
Percy	PERSON	frequently ordered the band of his regiment to play under the chestnut trees for the gratification of the Miss Byleses who then , as they said , had ' God Save the King ' in perfection . ''

		It was about this time that the doctor was '' walking one day with a Whig gentleman in the vicinity of the Common where a division of the British lay encamped .

		His companion , pointing to the soldiers of the Crown , said , ' You see the cause of all our evils . ' '

		But you can not say that our evils are not red-dressed , ^ remarked Dr.

		Your pun is not a good one , ' observed his companion ; ` you have misspelt the word by adding another D. ' ` Well , ' replied the clerical joker , ` as a doctor of divinity , am I not entitled to the use of two D 's ? ' ''

		Later he was sentenced to banishment , and his goods to confiscation ; but out of respect for his character the
Board	ORGANIZATION	of War remitted the sentence as far as his worldly goods were concerned , and lessened the personal penalty to confinement in his own house .

		The soldier declined to quit his post before relief came , but the doctor overcame his scruples by offering to guard himself until the soldier 's return . ''

		The sentinel at last complied , '' says
Miss Leslie	PERSON	, '' and took the bucket and went to the pump , first resigning his musket to Dr.
Byles	PERSON	, who shouldered it in a very soldier-like manner , and paced the porch , guarding himself until the sentry came back , to whom on returning his piece he said , * Now , my friend , you see I have been guarded , reguarded , and disre - guarded . ' '' ''

		The Miss Byleses told me much of the scarcity of provisions and firewood throughout
Boston	LOCATION	during the
winter of 1775	DATE	, when the British and their adherents held out the town against the Yankee rebels , as they called them .

Trinity Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		For many years the sisters sequestered themselves in the old house , which held one glorious treasure in the portrait of Dr.
Byles	PERSON	by
Copley	ORGANIZATION	.

		They owned great stores of ancient plate , which they would never use or part with , and in spite of the increasing value of their little patrimony they lived in a poverty which would have been destitution but for the bounty of some friends whose kindness they never acknowledged by visits , since they left their home only to go to service at
Trinity	ORGANIZATION	, and then always heavily veiled .

		They liked receiving visits , however , and took pleasure in some very childish mysteries which they performed , as well as in showing their father 's portrait , and his papers -- some bearing the signatures of Queen

		AN ALLEGED PROTOTYPE OF
GOLDSMITH	PERSON	'S • ' VICAR . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		I stumbled into a literary pitfall .

		the other day , and 1 ought to have known better !

		Lest anyone else should be equally foolish , or unfortunate , I hereby make public confession .

		In my life of
John Newbery	PERSON	I told the true story of the sale of the manuscript of '' The Vicar of Wakefield '' -- which had been so garbled by
Boswell	PERSON	on account of his desire to extol his hero .

		Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	, at the expense of every one of his entourage , poor '' Goldy '' included , -- and I thought I had made myself familiar with all that was to be known about the writing and the publication of the ever-famous '' Vicar '' and '' the philanthropic publisher of Saint
Paul	PERSON	's Churchyard '' whose seat I inherited and sat in for so many years .

		A month or more ago , while digging and delving in those old-fashioned annuals so popular here and in
England	LOCATION	in the middle of the
last century	DATE	, I happened upon '' The
Moss Rose	PERSON	, '' edited by
A. A. Phillips	PERSON	and published in
New York	LOCATION	in
1848	DATE	, where I found a story by Tschokke -LRB- Zschokke ? -RRB-

		entitled `` Leaves from the Journal of a poor Vicar '' with this note prefixed : '' Translated from the German of Tschokke ; he intimates that it is taken from the English and that it probably gave
Oliver Goldsmith	PERSON	the first hint towards the ' Vicar of Wake - field . '

		If originally English it is not easy to understand why it was allowed to die . ''

		The Journal begins
Dec. 15 , 1764	DATE	, and ends
Jan. 16 , 1765	DATE	.

		Its whole conception , tone , and flavor at once recall `` The Vicar '' ; but the incidents , though suggestive of the
Goldsmith	PERSON	story , differ .

		It really reads , however , as though it might have been an ebauche for the `` Vicar . ''

		So I wrote to my old friend ,
Austin Dobson	PERSON	, the greatest living authority on eighteenth century English literature , especially on
Goldsmith	PERSON	and his time , asking him what he knew about it .

		Here is his reply : '' 75

		My Dear Welsh : '' This * Journal of a poor Vicar ' is always taming up as the germ of

W. J. Thorns	PERSON	in Notes and Queries as far back as

1857	DATE	-LRB- 2nd Series No 61 -RRB- .

		It appears first in the

1766	DATE	, some months after the publication of The Vicar in the previous
March	DATE	.

		Thorns says it also appeared in The Gentleman ^ s Magazine for
Jan. 1767	DATE	and The Gentleman 's Magazine of
1849	DATE	, which again reprinted it from the
Boston Chronicle	ORGANIZATION	of
1766	DATE	-- the
Chronicle	ORGANIZATION	having found it in The British Magazine .

		I do n't think it has any connection with
Goldsmith	PERSON	.

		This reference to

		`` GAWMING '' OR `` GORMING . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		In commenting , in your last issue , on
Colonel Higginson	PERSON	's article , `` The Migration of Words , '' you quote him as saying that '' only in
Marblehead	LOCATION	, on our coast , could be heard the uncouth word ` gawming ' -LRB- awkward , lubberly -RRB- which
Grose	PERSON	's dictionary contains as a North of
England	LOCATION	term . ''

		It strikes me that the Colonel is not strictly accurate in this assertion , for I recall that in my boyhood in the
Connecticut	LOCATION	valley of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	the word was in frequent use , and per - haps is to this day .

		I have never written or seen it written , and I confess that I had supposed it was spelled '' gorming . ''

		It is a word that I have frequently used , however , as I learned to use it , in the sense of '' gorming about '' -- that is to say , looking about in a clownish and aimless manner .

		I dare say there are not a few Yankees , or descendants of
Yankees	ORGANIZATION	, in
Chicago	LOCATION	who will recall this word as a not infrequent feature of everyday speech . ''

		The Wizard of M enlo Park . ''

		* Mr.
Edison	PERSON	is no longer '' the Wizard of Menlo Park , '' but rather the
Indefatigable Inventor of Orange	ORGANIZATION	, where his laboratories are now situated , and the much visited and inter - viewed resident of
Llewellyn Park	LOCATION	, the hand - some quarter of the town where he lives .

		But as he has so many thousand more important things to do than to talk to newspaper men , he is far from being a thoroughly satisfactory subject to the interviewing reporter , who has often been forced either to draw largely on his own imagina ^ tion in writing up his '' story , '' or to return to the printing office empty-handed .

		Hence the multi - tude of fables , more or less marvellous and amus - ing , that have for years enlivened the pages of the daily press under the pretense of giving infor - mation concerning the great inventor .

		To correct some of these false reports , and to give an authentic sketch of Mr.
Edison	PERSON	's life and achievements , Mr.
Francis Arthur Jones	PERSON	has written a highly readable and pleasantly instructive book , ''
Thomas Alva Edison	PERSON	: Sixty Years of an Inventor 's Life . ''

		It is , explains the author , `` in no sense an exhaustive ' Life ' of
Edison	ORGANIZATION	, and , indeed , could not be , seeing that the inventor is still young in heart and enthus - iasm , and that there are probably many years of his brilliant career still to run .

		His grand - father and great-grandfather lived to be cente - narians , and their noted descendant gives every indication of coming into healthy competition with them in the matter of a long life . ''

		The little town of
Milan	LOCATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	, is Mr.
Edison	PERSON	's birthplace , and it is almost exactly sixty-one years ago that he was born -- of good parentage , in a well-to-do condition of life .

		The father had come to
Milan	LOCATION	from
Canada	LOCATION	, where he had incurred the displeasure of the Dominion government by taking too active a part in the
Papineau Rebellion	ORGANIZATION	.

		An allotment of the public land which he had received was forfeited , and
Samuel Edison	PERSON	took a hurried leave of his home and made his way to the American side of the
St. Clair River	LOCATION	.

		It is worth noting , in connection with the son 's extraordinary powers of continuous work , that the father , in his flight from

		at
Milan	LOCATION	, and later removed to
Port Huron	LOCATION	,
Michigan	LOCATION	, where he '' busied himself in various enterprises '' and tried , with little success , to be a stern disciplinarian toward his son , he plays an imimportant part in Mr.
Jones	PERSON	's book .

		The mother , also a Canadian , appears to have been a woman of strong and refined character , and her influence over her gifted son was powerfid and lasting .

		She had been a school-teacher in
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	, and , as the son himself long after - ward declared , her experience in the school - room had taught her many things about human nature , and especially about boys .

		She was a fine reader , and used to read aloud to her hus - band and children , in '' a soft , clear , and finely modulated voice . ''

		At the age of nine , '' Al , '' as she called him , had read , or his mother had read to him , '' The Penny Encyclopaedia , ''
Hume	PERSON	's ''
England	LOCATION	, ''
Gibbon	PERSON	's ''
Rome	LOCATION	, ''
Sears	ORGANIZATION	's '' History of the World , '' and several works on subjects of wonderful fascination to him even thus early , -- electricity and other branches of science .

		That was certainly a good beginning , and as he had an excellent memory his reading sooner or later proved its value .

		Those early crowded years of newspaper - selling -LRB- and newspaper-printing , too -RRB- on the
Grand Trunk Railway	ORGANIZATION	, of chemical and electri - cal experiments , of work as telegrapher at various places in rapid succession -- for , though an expert operator , his scientific experiments en - grossed so much of his attention that discharge followed hot on the heels of every engagement -- all this has long been fairly familiar to a public curious about the smallest detail of the famous inventor 's history .

		Not everyone , however , knows that in Mr.
Edison	PERSON	's choice of science rather than letters for his life-work , journalism lost a great editor . ''

		The
Weekly Herald	ORGANIZATION	, '' which was edited , printed , and sold by the fifteen-year-old newsboy in connection with his general newspaper and candy trade on the train , was a rather remarkable sheet .

		Only one copy is now known to be extant , and a facsimile of one of its two small pages is given in the book .

		We are told that the ' English engineer
Stephen	PERSON	- son , who chanced to travel one day on the
Port Huron	LOCATION	and
Detroit	LOCATION	train , was so impressed with this little journal that he ordered a thousand copies ; and that '' even the
London	LOCATION	Times expressed interest in the paper , and unbent sufficiently to quote from its columns . ''

		Fortune is ever on the alert to serve him who is worthy of her favors .

		After a variety of experiences young
Edison	ORGANIZATION	was one morning walking along lower Broadway , wondering
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 127 whether the time would ever come when he could devote himself heart and soul to his germinat - ing schemes of invention , when the way was suddenly opened to him toward that desired end .

		Entering the office of the Law Gold Indicator , in Wall Street , he found trouble and confusion prevailing because something had gone wrong with the '' tickers , '' and brokers were despatching frantic messages to headquarters to find out what was the matter . ''

		Mr. Law was in the office , together with a small army of workmen , but no one seemed capable of locat - ing the trouble .

		Then
Edison	ORGANIZATION	, who was standing by and seemed mildly interested in the commotion , remarked that he thought he could put things to rights , and Mr.
Law	PERSON	told him to go ahead and see what he could do .

		Whereupon the young man quietly but deliberately removed a loose contact
spring	DATE	which had fallen between the wheels and immediately the instruments worked as chirpily as before .

		The repairers looked foolish and Mr. Law requested
Edison	PERSON	to step into his office .

		After asking him a few questions , Mr. Law offered him the position of manager of the service at a salary of
three hundred dollars	MONEY	a month .

		Edison says he nearly fainted when told what his remuneration was to be , but some - how he managed to keep a straight face and accepted the position with becoming gravity .

		Now that he had an assured income of
thirty-six hundred dollars	MONEY	a year ,
Edison	ORGANIZATION	immediately opened a workshop ` down town , ' and every moment that he could spare was devoted to his beloved experimenting . ''

		Another seeming accident , which led to still more important results , and which illustrates Mr.
Edison	PERSON	's quickness to take a hint from whatever source , occurred in connection with the invention of the incandescent electric light .

		A suitable fila - ment for the lamp had long been sought in vain . ''

		The inventor was seated in his laboratory alone one evening , a little serious over his thousand-and-one dis - appointments , though by no means crushed in spirit , and , as usual , thinking deeply , when his right hand , which lay idly upon the table , strayed towards a little pile of lampblack mixed with tar which his assistants had been using in connection with his telephone transmitter .

		Pick - ing up a modicum of this substance he began rolling it between his finger and thumb , still wondering what one thing he had forgotten which should make the electric light possible , and little dreaming that it lay between his fingers .

		For perhaps half an hour he continued to ponder and at the same time to roll the mixture , until at last he had obtained a thin thread not unlike a piece of wire in appearance .

		He looked at it idly , and then began to speculate on its possibilities as a filament for an incandescent lamp .

		It was carbon , of course , and , this being so , might have strength to withstand the electric current to a greater degree than platinum itself .

		He determined to put it to the test , and at once began the work of rolling out fine threads of the black com - position preparatory to placing them in the lamps . ''

		This experiment , though not wholly satisfactory , convinced the experimenter that he was at last on the right road .

		After further search and study , bamboo fibres were found to make the best filaments ; and then began a quest for speci - mens of all the twelve hundred known varieties of bamboo in all parts of the bamboo-growing world , in order to determine what kind was the best for the purpose .

		Nearly one hundred thousand doUars was spent in this bamboo-hunt , but the desired end was attained .

		Descriptions of many other interesting experi - ments and a sufficient number of not too tech - nical accounts of Edisonian inventions find a place in the book .

		Judged by the number and importance of his inventions , Mr.
Edison	PERSON	is the greatest inventor the world has yet seen .

		Out of twelve hundred applications for patents in this country , more than eight hundred have been granted so far ; and for patents in most of the other countries more than two thousand appli - cations have been filed .

		The closing chapters of the book treat more especially of Mr.
Edison	PERSON	the man , rather than the inventor .

		He is delightfully human in his attributes , as one learns from the following descriptive passage : '' Some one has described
Edison	PERSON	as ' thoroughly comfortable and undeniably human . '

		It is a queer form of description , and yet it suits the inventor admirably .

		Those portraits or drawings which show him with head resting upon his hand , and a solemn , dreamy look in his eyes , are all wrong .

		Edispn is the exact reverse of a dreamer , and always has been -- he never gives himself time to dream , and his chief characteristics through life have been marvellous alertness , indomitable determina - tion , and mercurial energy .

		His eyes are more often laughing with suppressed humor than solemn with thought .

		When he was a young man , and no one knew him , he was shy in disposition and seldom spoke of him - self or his doings .

		When he became famous he did not ' grow out of proportion to himself , ' but was the same simple , unaffected human being that he had always been .

		He has about as much conceit and self-esteem as there is air in one of his own electric globes , and the thing he fears most in life is a ' swelled head . '

		His kindliness is unfailing , and he never loses his temper .

		No man in the laboratory has ever seen Edison < let himself go ' ; and though his eyes may take on the sternness of a
Napoleon	PERSON	, his anger never expresses itself outwardly . ''

		An abundance of illustrative anecdote fol - lows , and these little characteristic incidents , combined with the numerous pictures of the man in various unstudied attitudes , make the reader feel something very like a personal acquaintance with him by the time the last page is reached With young men possessed of some love of science , fondness for machinery , a taste for ex - perimenting , and a touch perhaps of inventive genius , the book is sure to be a favorite ; as a finger-post pointing the way to success for brains , and energy , it ought to exert a good influence ; and its attractiveness to the lover of biography is beyond dispute .

March 1	DATE	, The Colonial , Relations of
England	LOCATION	AND
America	LOCATION	.

		* So many really excellent works dealing with the causes and events of the American Revolution have appeared of late that we scarcely feel the need of additional ones .

		Anything that ade - quately reproduces an historical period is of course welcome , especially when it comes from the pen of an accredited author .

		But what shall we say when the writer is seemingly unknown , at least among sober critical scholars ?

		Shall we say that the work will be any the less welcome , or simply that it will be more searchingly examined ?

		This question calls for practical application in the case of Mrs.
Mary A. M. Marks	PERSON	, who , from her home in the
British Isles	LOCATION	, has sent out two most interesting volumes on ''
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, 1763-1783 . ''

		In the Introduction to these volumes , we notice a very suggestive passage which reads as foUows : '' It is always interesting , and often instructive , to look back and see how the great events of the past appeared while they were taking place , and to compare contemporary views with the final verdict of history . ''

		This is the key to Mrs.
Marks	PERSON	's present work .

		Her authorities are almost exclusively contemporaneous in char - acter , and , as far as the mother country is concerned , are fairly comprehensive ; but on the colonial side they are , unfortunately , very limited .

		It might be said that this is only nat - ural , -- and so it may be ; but still it is hardly excusable .

		The historian of to-day knows no barrier of distance , no dividing line of land or sea .

		In this particular instance , however , the fault -- and surely we must call it such -- of ignoring sources from abroad , can be , from one point of view , fully condoned ; for , in carrying out her general scheme of things , Mrs.
Marks	PERSON	was not nearly so dependent upon documentary sources as she was upon narrative ones ; and could , therefore , quite easily dispense with colonial official records .

		With respect to co - lonial doings , she accepted facts as she found them in fairly reputable secondary authorities , and seemed to take it for granted that the reader would know all about them without his attention being called to them by her .

		Her interest was centred absolutely upon British contemporary opinions ; and in treating of them she has produced what all must admit to be a very creditable piece of work .

		Her main dependence was of course upon the Parlia - *

		In two volumes .


New York	LOCATION	:
D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		mentary History .

		Dare we say that some of her chapters are a mere epitome of it ?

		In truth they are an epitome , yet they are much more ; for at frequent intervals their narrative style is greatly enlivened by anecdotes , by glean - ings from .

		memoirs like
Wraxall	PERSON	's , and by per - sonal estimates of great men drawn from the writings of their contemporaries , associates , and friends .

		We have dealt with the carrying out of the first part of our author 's purpose , and have found it good .

		Let us now consider the carry - ing out of the second part .

		The report here can not be nearly so favorable .

		Mrs.
Marks	PERSON	, although hailing from the British Isles and presumably a Briton by birth or adoption , is extremely pro-colonial -- unnecessarily so , in fact .

		In many instances her account is so colored that the reader is obliged to infer one of two things : either that she is over-careful , and so desperately afraid of being thought prejudiced in favor of her own country that she errs in the other direction , or that she is pos - itively ignorant of the final verdict of history .

		Who to-day , knowing that
Bancroft	PERSON	wrote at a very anti-British period of American history , would think of accepting his judgment as conclu - sive , especially when
Lecky	PERSON	, Van Tyne ,
Winsor	ORGANIZATION	, and many more , have all supplemented him and have been generally accepted as in the highest degree authoritative by historical scholars ?

		Nevertheless , Mrs.
Marks	PERSON	often takes
Bancroft	PERSON	for her only guide , and has apparently regarded him as almost the only great secondary Amer - ican writer worthy a place in her bibliography .

		We have already remarked that our author takes colonial facts for granted .

		She does more than that .

		She gives as sober history myths like the Putnam wolf story , and offers an account of the
Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence	ORGANIZATION	without the slightest aUusion to its doubtful authenticity or to the long con - troversy concerning it .

		Likewise , she gives the traditional details of the
Peggy Stewart	PERSON	affair and of the
Boston	LOCATION	tea-party .

		On the side of technical construction , a few general criticisms are needed .

		Errors fre - quently occur , not so much in the body of the text as in the footnote references .

		These errors are largely born of carelessness ; quotation marks are omitted or misplaced , paraphrases are confounded with quotations , the works of authors are variously and often ambiguously cited , and sometimes even the original has been inaccurately rendered .

		But the really great merit of the book has
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 129 yet to be remarked upon .

		It lies in its inclu - siveness .

		Mrs.
Marks	PERSON	has taken a wonderfully broad view of her subject .

		She has treated colonial pre-Revolutionary affairs as a part only of British eighteenth-century history .


India	LOCATION	and other imperial possessions , at that time fully as important as the famous Thirteen , receive more or less attention , and home com - plications and local politics are given their due weight .

		This fact alone ought to commend the book to the favorable notice of specialists as well as of general readers , and win for it a place by the side of
Trevelyan 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		Two Studies of
George Meredith	PERSON	.

		* A certain passion for orderliness seems to have possessed Mr.
Elmer James Bailey	PERSON	while he wrote of the novels of
George Meredith	PERSON	.

		Each work is assigned its particidar place in the scheme of the whole , like cards in a library cata - logue ; and its displacement would be , one feels , equally improper .

		Throughout the study , it is assumed that a network of analogies and simil - arities binds his novels into a fabric of firmest texture , -- that , large and thickly settled as the world seen in them is , the chief inhabitants , if not all of one nation , are plainly of one family ; that they and the ordeals through which they pass are the product of one creative mind .

		The relation between
Meredith	PERSON	's various novels is Mr.
Bailey	PERSON	's point of departure .

		Borrowing terms from the artisan , he divides the fiction of Meredith into three periods , in which the author showed himself successively an apprentice , a journeyman , and a master - workman .

		To the first belong '' The Shaving of Shagpat '' and ``
Farina	PERSON	, '' -- the work of a writer strongly suggesting some of his prede - cessors and contemporaries , yet showing certain individual traits which later on were so highly colored .

		In the second period , although
Meredith	PERSON	had discovered the bent of his genius and was consciously possessed of power and skill , yet he was indubitably influenced by the writings of
Richardson	PERSON	and Fielding and
Sterne	PERSON	,
Dickens	PERSON	and
Thackeray	PERSON	and
George Eliot	PERSON	.

		The novels then produced -LRB- ''
Richard Feverel	PERSON	, '' ''
Evan Harrington	PERSON	, '' ``
Sandra Belloni	PERSON	, '' ''
Vittoria	PERSON	, '' and ''
Rhoda Fleming	PERSON	'' -RRB- were also an attack upon a sentimental deference to various long - * The Novels of

		michallenged ideals .

		When
Meredith	PERSON	became a master - workman , emancipated and Meredithian , he entered upon a period of free invention in which he attacked egoism -LRB- in `` Harry Rich - mond , '' ``
Beauchamp	PERSON	's Career , '' `` Short Stories , '' '' The Egoist , '' and '' The Tragic Comedians '' -RRB- , and then concentrated his interest into an assault upon the seemingly impregnable conventionality which looks upon the marriage-bond as indis - soluble -LRB- in ''
Diana	PERSON	of the Cross ways , '' '' Lord
Ormont	PERSON	and his Aminta , '' '' One of Our Conquerors , '' and '' The Amazing Marriage '' -RRB- .

		Such , briefly stated , is Mr.
Bailey	PERSON	's classifica - tion ; and in making it , he analyzes the characters and situations with true insight , appreciation , and restraint .

		He clearly sees and feels
Meredith	PERSON	's high ideals , his strength , his beauty of tempera - ment ; and yet , worthily of Meredith himself , he says , '' Whatever the impulse of the heart , they -LSB- his readers -RSB- know that it should be tempered to the working of the brain ; and they therefore do not undertake to assert more than that
Meredith	PERSON	must be regarded as no unworthy companion of the greatest English novelists . ''

		In Mr.
Bailey	PERSON	's study , short , definite , and concise as it is , the scope did not include
Meredith	PERSON	's poetry , which is but occasionally discussed and little quoted .

		Mrs.
M. Sturge Henderson	PERSON	has been far more ambitious in her study of Meredith as novelist , poet , and reformer .

		So desirous , indeed , was Mrs.
Henderson	PERSON	that her criticism should be comprehensive that she elicited the services of Mr.
Basil	PERSON	de Selincourt to write four chapters on
Meredith	ORGANIZATION	's poetry -LRB- xiv.-xvii . -RRB-

		.

		This contribution has a double value : it is intrinsically of worth , in its subtle exposition of Meredith 's philosophical thought and his poetical form or lack of it ; and , further , it goes far to illuminate the treatment of char - acter and situation in his novels .

		As Mrs.
Henderson	PERSON	has said elsewhere in the book , ''
Meredith	PERSON	's poems are his novels in distillar tion . ''

		To quote again -LRB- chapter xvi . -RRB-

		, `` The distinctive quality of Meredith 's poetical work depends for a large part of its value on the incisiveness , the grit , which are to be associated with the emphasis he thus lays upon the need for a firm foundation of vital energy ^ to the driving force , the horse-power of the soul . ''

		This conclusion is in tune with Mrs.
Henderson	PERSON	's major premise , '' Intermittently ,
Meredith	PERSON	is a great artist ; primarily and consistently , he is a moralist -- a teacher . ''

		Making no such lines of demarcation and in - terception as does Mr.
Bailey	PERSON	between
Meredith	PERSON	's novels , Mrs.
Henderson	PERSON	analyzes them in chrono - 130 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, logical order , in detail , conscientiously and at times brilliantly , with the moralist and reformer ever in the foreground .

		Endowed as she is with a rare intellectual responsiveness , and thoroughly conversant with her subject , Mrs.
Henderson	PERSON	is without doubt entitled to her opinions .

		From these , however , the student of Meredith may occasionally beg to dissent , -- notably from the contention that '' The Tragic Comedians '' and '' One of Our Conquerors '' are among
Meredith	PERSON	's greatest novels .

		Grant - ing at times a difference in estimates between the writer and the reader , the latter will find all that Mrs.
Henderson	PERSON	has to say interesting and her quotations both beautiful and appro - priate .

		She is especially felicitous in some of her phrases describing
Meredith	PERSON	's artisanship , -- such as '' his uniting of problem and pageant in the reading of life , '' and his '' un vitalized '' or '' middle - distance '' characters -- the sisters Pole , for instance , in ''
Sandra Belloni	PERSON	. ''

		It gives one the feeling of being turned from a door , to find that both of Meredith 's critics , sensitive as they are to his beauty , his brilliance , and the versatility of his intellect , fail to assign him unreservedly the highest of literary positions .

		Mrs.
Henderson	PERSON	feels that where
Meredith	PERSON	's genius falters , his judgment is not always ready to give support . ''

		His inspiration , '' she says , '' appears to lie in his poetic grasp , the intensity of realization with which he holds to the main issue and keeps it living , in defiance of the tangles and complexity he is forever weaving every side of it , and which might have been expected to prove fatal to the life within .

Federal Regulation of Railway Rates	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Albert N. Merritt	PERSON	.

		Boston :
Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		versity
School of Law	ORGANIZATION	.

		After discussing the nature of the public service rendered by a rail - road , the benefits conferred by it on the public , and the burdens imposed by it on the public , he comes to his main purpose -- '' the amelioration of the existing relations between railway corpo - rations and the public whom they serve . ''

		This is attempted in the four final chapters on the results of ineffectual control , the reasonableness of rates , the standard of service , and the proper regulation of service .

		Here we have a model treatise on a vexing question .

		Approaching this from the '' inside '' standpoint , equipped with expert experience , and yet with an a priori handicap -- in the reader 's opinion -- through his very identifica - tion in sympathy with the railway managers , he soon commands respectful and admiring atten - tion through his dispassionate and judicial frame of mind , which never once fails him .

		He sees as a railway man -- he sees as truly as one of the great travelling and shipping and consuming public .

		The tone and the temper are as admir - able as though he might be a university professor of railway economics engaged in academic dis - cussion .

		This contrasts favorably with the almost petulant impatience displayed in the recent special message of President
Roosevelt	PERSON	, as he contemplates the obdurate federal judge who decides according to his conviction as to the law and the Constitution .

		We note the follow - ing passage : '' Cases -LRB- under the
Interstate Commerce	ORGANIZATION	Act -RRB- were contested step by step from the hearings before the
Commission	ORGANIZATION	up through the lower courts , until at length they reached
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	for its interpretation .

		But in each case that court restricted its decision , as far as practicable , to the issues directly involved in the case on appeal ; and frequently it happened that the appeal resulted in the case being sent back , either to a lower court with instructions , or to the
Commission	ORGANIZATION	for a rehearing .

		It was a slow process , and one which severely tested the patience of those who felt that their grievances remained in the meantime imremedied .

		Yet it was necessarily consequent upon the application of legislation in an untried field of such magnitude , and which was occupied by a conflict of complicated inter - ests .

		By degrees the decisions of
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	dissipated the obscurity which had overshadowed the provisions of the Act , and pointed out the way to their proper interpretation . ''

		In this connection Mr.
Merritt	PERSON	does equal justice to the
Commission	ORGANIZATION	and to the Federal courts when he discerningly says : '' The present
Commission	ORGANIZATION	is composed of men of undoubted integrity and of great individual acumen .

		They have been battling with some of the greatest prob - lems which have ever confronted any similar body of men .

		The subject-matter with which they are dealing is of comparatively recent origin .

		Their decisions can -
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 131 not be based upon a long line of judicial opinions .

		It is net at all surprising , therefore , that they have made mistakes .

		That those individuals whose limited field of investigation has been entirely confined to those cases where the decisions of the
Commission	ORGANIZATION	have appeared the weakest , the purpose of whose investigations has been to find fault with the work of the
Commission	ORGANIZATION	, should find abundant material for their purpose , is by no means remarkable ... With regard to the points of law upon which the
Commission	ORGANIZATION	and the Courts have been at variance , the
Commission	ORGANIZATION	has in each case assumed the reasonable interpretation which would give to the Inter - state Commerce Law the broad application which its framers evidently intended that it should have , whUe the Courts on the other hand have narrowed and moulded its application till its interpretation is more in accord - ance with the genius of our institutions , which is to give the largest possible range to private initiative which is consistent with equal rights and justice to all , by which policy it is believed that in the long run the greatest good will be secured for the greatest number . ''

		It may be pertinent to add that Courts which have given some recent decisions that are in every memory , deserve courteous treatment on the part of a government whose hands they have so much strengthened .

		The decision in the
Brown	PERSON	case in
1896	DATE	, which enabfes the govern - ment to give complete immunity to witnesses , and so secure testimony previously unattain - able ; the Joint-Traffic decision in
1899	DATE	and the
Addyston Pipe Company	ORGANIZATION	decision in
1899	DATE	, which brought under the ban of the Sherman Act of
1890	DATE	any form of combination in restraint of trade by railroads and industrials respectively ; and the
Northern Securities	ORGANIZATION	deci - sion in
1904	DATE	, which forbade the railroads to smuggle in again the trust form of combination in the guise of a holding company ; these alone , out of a number , bear sufficient testimony to the cooperation of the
Federal	ORGANIZATION	bench in the arduous undertaking of preventing injurious monopoly .

		When in
1892	DATE	the famous decision by
Justice Blatchford	ORGANIZATION	in the Counselman case sustained this witness in his refusal to possibly incriminate himself , and
Congress	ORGANIZATION	passed in the next session an act of immunity for witnesses imder such circumstances .

		Judge
Grosscup	PERSON	, in the notable decision for
James	PERSON	and
McLeod	PERSON	, still sustained these witnesses in their refusal to testify , on the ground that the statute did not secure to a witness '' his place in society , his good name in the world . ''

		Just now it is interesting to recall that the administration of that day did not publicly censure Judge
Grosscup	PERSON	for a decision which arrested its procedure -- for the government could not carry a criminal case further by appeal to a higher court .

		Silently the department of justice took up the line of march de novo on a similar case that came up just then in a lower court in
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, and after three years the administration was rewarded for its patience and composure when , in the
Brown	PERSON	case ,
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	sustained the helpful decision rendered in the two lower courts .

		Mr.
Haines	PERSON	, when he discusses rate-making , gets away from a crude '' cost of service '' theory , without landing in a brutal '' what the traffic will bear . ''

		He says : '' Viewing the service of transportation as a contract relation , the standard for determining the reasonable - ness of the compensation demanded for rendering a specific service should include , as one of its elements , a recognition of the value of the service to the person for whose benefit it is performed , as well as the cost to the person performing it ... The cost is the lowest com - pensation that the carrier would accept ; its value to the traveller or shipper is the highest compensation that he would pay .

		Somewhere between these limits there is a balance or reasonable adjustment of the benefit to each of the parties to the transaction . ''

		That '' somewhere '' he further indicates in saying : '' An average standard of service should be estab - lished as to speed of trains , character of equipment , and other conditions as to safety , comfort and convenience ; the number and frequency of such trains should be suited to the average requirements of the people in general ; and this service should be rendered at a fixed rate per mile per passenger ... Viewing the railroad company as a public servant , it would be expected to meet the necessary requirements of the public at large at the actual cost of service , that cost including a fair rate of interest upon the investment in private property .

		... If the necessary requirements of the travelling public are to be furnished at cost , where is the profit to the railroad stockholder , the inducement to invest money in the performance of a public service ?

		The answer is based upon the other element of a reasonable rate -- the value of the service performed in each specific transaction apart from its value as a necessary require - ment for the people in general .

		The specific value to each person is in the different character of the service rendered , the difference to be measured by the depart - ure from the average service required for the average mileage rate of fare . ''

		Mr.
Haines	PERSON	suggests that this departure from the average service may involve greater speed , or better accommodations , and that the carriers should sell such higher values in speed and com - fort for what they could obtain .

		He would make an average service second class , a better than average first class , and a less than average third class .

		This is his proposition for passenger traffic .

		Coming to freight traffic , he seeks to find '' some commodity which in weight and bulk constitutes an average percentage of the total traffic , and which is not susceptible of the dis - tinctions as to inherent qualities , manner of packing , and insurable value , which affect the classification of most commodities for transpor - tation by rail .

		It should be a commodity in 132 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, such general use that fluctuations in its price would not merely affect a class of users , but would exert a general and profound influence upon the public welfare . ''

		He finds this in bituminous coal , and would base a reasonable rate on the average cost of service per ton mile , eliminating the elements of equipment other than motive power and those of receipt and delivery , since these may be and have been handled in private cars on private terminals .

		Space does not allow even the presentation of the forcible arguments set forth by Mr.
Haines	PERSON	against government ownership , but a few words must be given to his suggestions for a more rational and effective control of railroads .

		He would '' make the corporations penally respon - sible for results , -- its officials also , if you please , -- but leave the means to them . ''

		He would secure the advantages of unified railroad management and of efficient government super - vision , without permitting further consolidation or resorting to
State	ORGANIZATION	ownership , by taking into counsel with the
Interstate Commerce Commis	ORGANIZATION	- sion the
American Railway Association	ORGANIZATION	and the traffic associations .

		The sooner public opinion removes the ban of outlawry from railway men as such , the sooner we may come to some rational control which recognizes the values and the rights involved on either side .

		This book is an admirable chapter added to the fruitful discussion of railway problems .

		One misleading misprint should be corrected in another edition by the insertion of a decimal point before the figures on page 111 giving the passenger rates in
Germany	LOCATION	,
Russia	LOCATION	, and
India	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Merritt	PERSON	's work on '' Federal Regulation of Rates '' is a prize volume in response to the generosity of Messrs.
Hart	PERSON	,
Schaffner	PERSON	, and
Marx of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, and is a careful and dispassionate piece of work .

		After showing that rates in this country have not been excessive , and that the public grievance is discrimination rather than extortion , the writer justifies federal control and condemns rate-making by a commission .

		In an excellent discussion of a rational plan for public control of rate-making , he suggests that some - thing must be wrong with the present commission plan in that it has produced such general dis - satisfaction .

		He gives the
Commission	ORGANIZATION	due credit , and explains the fact that ninety per cent of the cases which it has carried to the courts have been decided against it , in the passage we have already cited .

		The radical basis of the weakness of the present Commission he very justly finds in the inconsistency of its functions .

		It is to the railroads '' police magistrate , prose - cuting attorney , and judge ; the law imposes upon it both the administrative duty of investi - gating alleged violations of the law , and of prosecuting offenders , while at the same time it is given the quasi judicial duty of sitting as a court to try the cases in which it is itself fre - quently the prosecutor . ''

		He is not pleased with the discretionary power to fix rates given to the
Commission	ORGANIZATION	by the
Hepburn	PERSON	law , and his own constructive contribution to this discussion is the suggestion of a special court for the hand - ling of railway cases , to which the
Commission	ORGANIZATION	could present its findings .

		To the objection that such a court could not be empowered to fix rates , but could merely declare certain rates illegal , and that an endless series of such declarations might be made necessary by the nominal reduction in infinitesimal sums , he well replies that a court can always enjoin the whole as well as the part of an unlawful thing .

		This book , while inferior in command of English style to the one reviewed with it , is of equal value as to the temper and the matter .

		Really , if this rate of production is kept up , our older novelists will have to look to their laurels , for the new one is fast proving himself their equal in rich - ness of mind , in depth of human sympathy , and in skilled delineation of character and contrivance of plot .

		We are not prepared to say that '' Somehow Grood '' is any better than its two predecessors ; but we are quite sure that it has given us the same general quality of enjoyment , and that a higher quality than is derivable from the work of any other novelist now living and active in either

		The announcement of its appearance will fill many hearts with anticipative joy , and its read - ing will realize every reasonable expectation .

1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 133 The '' sins of will '' and '' taints of blood '' out of which good is finally wrought are revealed to us in somewhat shadowy outline , but we gather , as the story occasionally gives us glimpses of the past , enough of their general character to reconstruct the essentials of a basis of understanding .

		Some score of years before the story opens , an English girl had gone out to
India	LOCATION	and had fallen the victim of a seducer .

		We are not exactly told , but are made to infer , that her betrayer had resorted to a baseness that in some manner made her out to be less blame - worthy than a bare statement of her case would make her appear .

		Soon after the betrayal , the young Englishman to whom she was betrothed had come out to urge his claim , had married her , had afterwards discovered her secret , and , after vainly seeking a legal separation , had deserted wife and child , disappearing for parts unknown .

		It takes a long time for the reader to piece this history together -LRB- as readers of '' Alice-f or-Short '' wUl not need to be told -RRB- , for the author makes a fine art of indirection , and one must have all the shrewdness of a detective to recognize the clues that are hidden in the most unexpected crevices of the text .

		The beginning of the story simply introduces to our atten - tion a bronzed stranger arriving in
London	LOCATION	and making the preliminary arrangements for settling down in a country which he has evidently not visited for many years .

		He is a man of wealth , for he has cabled to
New York	LOCATION	for credit , but that is practi - cally all that we are told about him .

		Before he has been in
London	LOCATION	twenty-four hours he has an acci - dent in the Twopenny Tube which gives the story its real starting-point .

		Reaching under the seat to recover a lost coin , he receives a current of high voltage , and , otherwise rallying from the shock , it is foimd that his memory has completely disappeared .

		He knows nothing of the past , does not even remem - ber his own name .

		A young woman , his fellow - passenger , having been talking with him just before , feels somehow responsible for him , and , not knowing what else to do , takes him to her home in a cab .

		Now this young woman is his own daughter , legally although not legitimately , and her mother is the wife whom he has not seen for twenty years .

		When the mother -LRB- and wife -RRB- sees him , she knows him at once , but restrains herself to the point of making no exhi - bition of her emotion .

		During the following days , as the stranger becomes a normal man again in all respects save that of his lapsed memory , he proves so agreeable an inmate of the household that he is invited to stay on ; he gets a business position in the city , and settles down to a routine existence .

		As time goes on , he comes to love the woman who has befriended him , but is always haunted by the fear that somewhere in his forgotten past there may be a wife who is mourning his disappearance .

		The real wife , meanwhile , does not dare to enlighten him , for that might mean a recurrence of the old repulsion , and a second desertion .

		After a while , however , both yield to the call of affection , and a wedding takes place .

		The leading interest of the story , from this time on , is found in the psychologi - cal study of the man 's mind , for memory does come fully back to him in the end , but by slow degrees and evoked by all sorts of subtly suggestive associ - ations .

		In this aspect , the author 's treatment of the story is absolutely masterly , revealing , if anything , a higher power than is displayed in his earlier novels .

		When recollection returns to him in full flood , its imagined terrors are dissipated for both man and woman , and the tale ends serenely .

		Space does not permit us to write at any length of the minor char - acters or the secondary elements of the plot .

		There are a dozen other figures besides those of the two prin - cipals , outlined with penetration and genial insight , -- figures that the best of novelists might be proud to own .

		The young people concerned have their love - stories also , and two such affairs , discussed and illus - trated at great length , lend their charm to the narrative .

		The plot , while simple in one sense , is extremely ingenious and complicated in another , for it involves the twisting together of two sets of threads , broken for many years , and the uniting into a con - gruous whole of elements seemingly almost as dis - parate as those of '' Alice-for-Short , '' And the writer 's style -- simple and natural , freighted alter - nately with rich humor and warm-hearted philosophy -- is so enjoyable on its own account that it makes garrulity a virtue , and gives point to the most point - less of digressions .

		If yearly novels from this master - hand are to be a feature of the bookish future , we shall hope to keep a hold upon life as long as they last .

		Another of the novels which Mr.
E. F. Benson	PERSON	puts forth with such unflagging industry is at hand .

		It is entitled '' Sheaves , '' which may mean anything you wish , and introduces us to a group of the English gentlefolk whose lives and manners and ideas the author knows so intimately .

		They are interesting people , and their characters are drawn for us with evident fidelity .

		Conversation and incident are alike natural , and the author 's contribution of comment and analysis is temperate and pleasing .

		The lead - ing purpose of the story is to study the case of a man married to a woman many years his senior .

		It is an ideal union in all respects save that of age , and nothing mars its happiness until the wife contracts tuberculosis , and the couple join the colony of exiles at
Davos	LOCATION	.

		A year or two still remains for her , and their happiness goes on under the new conditions with hardly a flaw .

		But the end is inevitable , and when it comes we have a feeling that the author found it a relief -- that he could not see how to sustain the unnatural situation any longer .

		It must be admitted that the story , even then , is drawn out to tiresome length , and that it demands much judi - cious skipping if it is to provide tolerable entertain - ment .

		Mr.
Benson	PERSON	is too facile a writer to achieve the higher aims of fiction , and one is not likely to remember his novels six months after having read them .

		Mr.
Harold Bindloss	PERSON	takes us to the Canaries and the west coast of
Africa	LOCATION	for the scene of his novel . ''

		For Jacinta '' tells us , in the main , 134 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, desperate venture which has for its object the float - ing of a sunken ship and the salvage of its cargo of palm oil .

		Two men engage in this enterprise , both for love .

		It is the story of a struggle with loath - some conditions and deadly disease , told with much of the grim power that Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	has applied to similar situations .

		The strong man contending with adverse circumstance is evidently the favorite theme of this writer , who has illustrated it alike in the Cuban jungle and on the prairies of the Canadian northwest .

		He now gives us a new variant upon the same theme .


Jacinta	PERSON	, the daughter of an English merchant in the Canaries , is the sort of heroine who is so keen about character that , before she wUl sur - render to a man 's love , she will insist upon his acquiring merit -LRB- as the Japanese say -RRB- by meeting the test of danger , and staking his life for her sake upon the odd chance of success .

		This does not seem to us altogether admirable , but the hero seems to have liked her all the more for it , and took the risk .

		The story is capitally told , and takes us to an inter - esting part of the world not much frequented by novelists .

		As in all the books by Mr.
Bindloss	PERSON	that we have read , the money motive is forced a little too much , jarring the romantic sensibilities to which he particularly endeavors to appeal .

		A lumber camp which seems to be somewhere in the
Oregon	LOCATION	country is the scene of Miss
Mantle	PERSON	's ''
Gret	PERSON	. ''

		Gret is unfortunate in her parents .

		Her father , who owns the camp , prefers the gaiety of
Portland	LOCATION	to the simple life of the woods , and her mother , who lives in the camp with her , lets the child grow up without much care .

		In consequence ,
Gret	PERSON	is a very unconventional maiden with ideas of her own .

		She has also engaging qualities which make her the idol of the men , and her sway over her rough subjects is absolute .

		One day a youth sug - gests that they get married , and Gret , after weighing the suggestion and realizing that relations with her own family are getting a little strained , falls in with the plan .

		Her only idea about it is that if the trouble at home should become acute , she would want another place to go to .

		So the two start out one morning on an all-day excursion , and when they return in the evening they have been united by a justice of the peace of a town some miles distant .

		But on the way back Gret calmly informs the youth that he is to say nothing about it until he gets her permission .

		Then months , and even years go by , and nothing more is said upon the subject .

		They meet casually in the camp , but the marriage episode is completely ignored and practically forgotten .

		Presently a glimpse of the great world comes to our little pagan heroine , brought by some young men who undertake to operate a saw-mill in the neighborhood of the camp .

		Their ignorance is so pathetic that
Gret	PERSON	is moved to pity , takes the burden upon her shoulders , and con - verts failure into success .

		A man of wealth and culture comes to visit them , makes Gret 's acquaint - ance , and is charmed by her unsophistication and native strength of character .

		She offers so refresh - ing a contrast to the women of the world whom he has known and who have for many years sought to make him their prey , that he asks her to be his wife , and she , having learned for the first time the mean - ing of love , joyfully consents .

		Then follows a season in
San Francisco	LOCATION	, where Gret blossoms out and wins all hearts by her fresh charm .

		Then comes a return to the camp , and the discovery of Gret 's early mar - riage .

		She is quite frank about it , and admits to him that she had never intended to mention the in - cident , regarding it as closed and quite insignificant .

		Naturally , the man of the world can not view the matter in just that light , and
Gret	PERSON	's romance is ended forever .

		Thus is brought to its semi-tragic conclusion a story which is told with singular charm , and which is remarkable alike for picturesque quality and penetrative insight into character .

		Miss
Glasgow	LOCATION	's latest novel has both dignity and charm , although certain almost melodramatic hap - penings , huddled into the closing chapters , do not seem quite in keeping with the sincerity and restraint of what has gone before . ''

		The Ancient Law '' is the title of the book , and its theme is the inevitable consequence of sin .

		The hero , when we first make his acquaintance , has just been released from prison , where he has served a term of several years for the fraudulent diversion of trust funds .

		He had been happUy married , but temptation had proved too much for him , and a desire to keep the pace of
New York	LOCATION	life had led to his downfall .

		In consequence of his crime , his father -LRB- a wealthy Virginian -RRB- had dis - owned him , but had offered a home to his wife and child .

		We meet him one
spring	DATE
morning	TIME	, on the road in
Virginia	LOCATION	, ready to start life anew .

		His prison years have chastened him , and the wild impulses which had once made him a criminal have been wholly subdued .

		His one purpose henceforth is to expiate his fault by a life of helpful service to his fellows .

		He settles in the first country town that offers him an opening , and soon strikes root there .

		His past is behind him , and his new asso - ciates know nothing of it .

		His kindly ways soon win for him the esteem of the little community , and presently his neighbors turn to him for leadership and even seek to make him the mayor of the town .

		Then the long-delayed blow falls upon his head ; the story of his past comes out , and he determines to seek a new home .

		At just this juncture , however , news comes to him of his father 's death , and of the wish of his wife and child that he should come to live with them again .

		The double crisis occurs midway in the narrative , and gives a new complexion to the second half of the book .

		His life henceforth is one of luxury but also of moral isolation .

		He is received by his family , but can not be one of them .

		He has offended their proudest traditions , and the reconciliation is only a surface affair .

		The wife wUl do her duty by him , but she can not control the feel - ing of repulsion which his presence creates .

		His only comfort is in his daughter , who loves him , but in whose nature he discovers an alarming intensifi - cation of his own early recklessness .

		This , in fact , leads her to the brink of disaster , from which , for a
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 136 time , he rescues her .

		The later chapters of the story have a sort of
Jean Valjean	PERSON	pathos that works powerfully upon the reader 's feelings .

		The end is rather inconclusive , hut falls just short of tragedy , for it leaves the hero with the prospect of a return to the little town in which his new life hegan , and of a peaceful rounding out of a destiny that had once seemed hopelessly shattered .

		J The name of Mr.
E. V. Lucas	PERSON	is essays of the probably associated by most Ameri - EUansort .

		^ ^ - ^ ^ readers with a series of delight - ful anthologies , delightfully named . ''

		The Open Road , '' '' The Friendly Town , '' '' The Gentlest Art , '' -- each title is alluring , and the contents , chosen on no merely mechanical principle , amply fulfil the promise of the titles .

		But Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	's literary labors are not limited to compilation ; he is also an essayist with several small volumes to his credit , each marked by the same unique quality that distinguishes his editorial work .

		The latest of these , '' Character and Comedy '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is made up in about equal parts of informal essays and sketches and of ironic episodes related by means of letters .

		The essays are of an Elian flavor , full of piquant humor , keen psychology , intent and happy observation of the minor issues of life . ''

		I am not lucky , '' com - plains Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	, apropos of his exceptional experi - ences with a Persian kitten . ''

		The harvest of my quiet eye comprises little that is unusual . ''

		And so he asserts a great envy of men who have `` the luck of the woods '' -LRB- as he calls the faculty of happening upon the rare and curious sights of nature -RRB- , a great liking for detective stories and for `` the old-fashioned novel in which there are long journeys , and in which new characters are continually appearing , '' and a firm conviction that the perfect life is that of the conjurer who goes about '' continually mystifying fresh groups of people -- with cab fares both ways and a satisfactory fee . ''

		This playful , unhurried view of life -- with long afternoons to spend poking about the Zoo ,
summer	DATE	holidays for walking trips through quiet
Shropshire	PERSON	, spare time to enjoy
Boswell	PERSON	and to evoke a flesh-and-blood cousin for
Charles Lamb	PERSON	out of a casual reference in a letter -- this sort of life is finding less and less expression in the world of letters .

		Wherefore many readers , who lament the passing of the essay , will welcome Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	's practice of it .

		The epistolary comedies are amusing in their way , but Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	lacks the dra - matic sense to bring them to a telling climax .

H. B. Irving	PERSON	's '' Occasional Papers '' -LRB- Small ,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The author is a student of history with a good Oxford training , a member of the English bar , and a successful actor , repre - senting the honorable traditions and aspirations of the best dramatic circles .

		All of these influences are apparent in the present volume .

		The first four essays deal with such topics as '' The Calling of the Actor '' and '' The English Stage in the
Eighteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Under the latter caption , which belongs to the most serious study in the volume , Mr.
Irving	PERSON	points out that during this second great century of our national stage the interest shifts from the drama to the player ; it was the age of plays deserving soon to die , presented by actors of enduring fame , who were spurred to the highest histrionic effort by the inadequate scenery , the anachronous costumes , and the immediate criticism of a most free-speaking body of spectators .

		Of this last incentive many instances , some of them even literally striking , are embodied in the chapter .

		The second and fourth essays might have been welded advantageously into one , offering a discussion of the actor 's calling and status .

		There is not a little suggestiveness in the constant recurrence of such expressions as '' social recognition , '' and in Mr.
Irving	PERSON	's emphasis on the growing respectability of the craft .

		One encourag - ing and laudable feature is the author 's insistence on the desirability and possibility of unsullied char - acter and lofty moral ideals in the life behind the scenes and off the stage .

		The last three studies are devoted to three notorious criminal cases , which are readably presented with no disturbing suggestion of the '' detective '' method .

		Between the two parts of the work there seems to be no necessary connec - tion , -- although it is possible that by some subtle psychology the reader interested in the actor is often interested in the criminal , and the present reviewer may admit that he passed from the first division of essays to the second with no particular difficulty .

		On the whole , the hours devoted to Mr.
Irving	PERSON	's '' Occasional Papers '' will be spent pleasantly , and not without gain , by readers who have not already come across most of the studies in the English magazines .

		The blue cover of Miss
Jane Harri	PERSON	- Topographyof g ^ ^ ' g `` Mythology and Monuments primitive
Athens	LOCATION	... • ^ .

		* ^ i '' • i ji i of Ancient
Athens	LOCATION	is hardly less familiar to the archaeological tourist than is the red binding of the tripper 's ''
Baedeker	PERSON	. ''

		But the book is overweighted with speculative mythology ; and as it is now superseded for scholars by Dr.
Frazer	PERSON	's monumental edition of
Pausanias	LOCATION	, and for the general public by Professor
Ernest Gardner	PERSON	's '' Ancient
Athens	LOCATION	, ''
Miss Harrison	PERSON	does not care to republish it .

		Instead , she issues , under the title ' * Primitive
Athens	LOCATION	as Described by Thucydides '' -LRB-
Cambridge University Press	ORGANIZATION	;
New York	LOCATION	: Putnam -RRB- , a new manifesto of her allegiance to the theories of Dr.
Dorpfeld	PERSON	against which Mr.
Frazer	PERSON	and Mr.
Gardner	PERSON	still harden their hearts .

		The little volume 136 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, of 168 pages takes the form of a commentary on the famous Chapter of Thucydides -LRB- II .

		15 -RRB- in which the historian demonstrates the small compass of primitive
Athens	LOCATION	by the fact that the oldest shrines are all either on the Acropolis or in the adjoining precinct to the south -LRB- or southwest -RRB- .

		Miss
Harri	PERSON	- son discusses all the old topographical problems which look so large when we are at
Athens	LOCATION	, and so small , except to specialists , when we are away .

		She tells us all that is known and much that is conjec - tured of the earlier pre-Persian
Athens	LOCATION	on which
Pater	ORGANIZATION	's imagination so fondly dwelt , and of the earliest Mycenaean
Athens	LOCATION	on the
Acropolis	LOCATION	.

		She gives her reasons as a scholar , but what is perhaps her chief reason she does not explicitly mention : Dr. DOrpfeld , most persuasive of lecturers , most fascinating in personality , is infallible .

		Miss
Harrison	PERSON	's book , which is admirably illustrated , is by no means too technical to be enjoyed by any intelligent reader who has visited or intends to visit
Athens	LOCATION	.

		But only in the pages of a technical journal could the dissenting critic animadvert upon her construing of Thucydides -LRB- in which she fol - lows Professor
Verrall	PERSON	-RRB- , her interpretation of the '' Enneakrounos Episode , '' or her identification -LRB- pp. 97-8 -RRB- of the Lensea with the Anthesteria in the face of recent evidence that proves them distinct .

		The freedmen Gteneral
John Eaton	PERSON	's book entitled in and after '' Grant ,
Lincoln	LOCATION	, and the Freedmen '' the Civil War .

		-LRB- Longmans -RRB- is an interesting and valuable addition to the historical literature of the Civil War period .

		It deals mainly with one sub - ject -- the condition of the Southern negroes during the war , the efforts that were made to protect them from the results of their own ignorance , helplessness , and lack of morality , and the efforts to help them make the beginnings of an independent life .

		General
Eaton	PERSON	, then Chaplain of an
Ohio	LOCATION	regiment , with some experience as a school superintendent , was selected by
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	in
1862	DATE	to care for the contra - bands who were flocking by thousands into the
Union	LOCATION	lines .

		He shrank from the great burden ; but
Grant	PERSON	, with the insight that marked his military appoint - ments , urged it upon him .

		It is needless to say that the work was carried on with ability and conscience , and that the efficiency of the Superintendent grew with the increase of the burden .

		General
Eaton	PERSON	's duties and position brought him into intimate per - sonal contact with
Grant	PERSON	, and they were friends until
Grant	ORGANIZATION	's death .

		The book gives an insight into
Grant	PERSON	's mind and heart that is exceedingly interest - ing .

		The author shows
Grant	ORGANIZATION	's keen interest in the welfare of the freedmen , and his intuitive grasp of the great questions involved .

		Every appeal to him met with ready response and loyal support , and this interest and support were not lessened even when the awful responsibility of the whole war was put upon him .

		At the time when his own standing was still insecure .

		Grant took the risk of furnishing hun - dreds of thousands of dollars ' worth of rations and clothing to the needy freedmen on his own respon - sibility , without orders or authority to do it .

		In
1870	DATE
General Eaton	ORGANIZATION	was appointed by
Grant Com	ORGANIZATION	- missioner of Education , and so maintained his per - sonal relations with him .

		The author was also brought into official and personal relations with
Lincoln	LOCATION	, and tells many interesting stories of those eventful years .

		Five years ago this journal noticed SrS * ?

		^ Mr.
Arthur Symons	PERSON	's volume entitled '' Cities , '' and accorded its author the praise of treating with attractive individualism a commonplace theme .

		In his latest book , that well - known littSrateur has brought together such of his writings as he hoped would lay open to his readers the souls of some `` Cities of
Italy	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Button -RRB- . ''

		And as love , or it maybe hate , can alone reveal soul to soul , among human beings , so , it seems to me , the soul of a city will reveal itself only to those who love , or , perhaps , hate it , with a far-sighted emotion . ''

		In this frame of mind , which is becoming delight - fully familiar and has been so daintily voiced by ''
Vernon Lee	PERSON	'' in her '' Genius Loci , '' Mr.
Symons	PERSON	deals with the historic centres of Italian life and cul - ture .

		Not seldom his treatment becomes purely a con - sideration of the local manifestation of the art spirit , -- as in the pages on
Brescia	LOCATION	; nor are the sections representing this tendency the least attractive in the book to a reader at all interested in Italian painting .

		Space forbids the recording of mUd protests ; but the reviewer happened to spend the same winter in
Rome	LOCATION	that gave Mr.
Symons	PERSON	the basis of his chapters on that ever-beloved mistress of the seven hills , and we have one tiny quarrel : in the course of forty pages our author lovingly describes three sunsets , whereas the glorious softly-shifting lights of those wintry mornings are coldly neglected .

		And this personal subjective difference may serve to indicate pretty adequately the tone of most of the criticisms we should pass upon the book .

		It is a volume well worth while , and will be enjoyed by many readers ; it will be most valuable and most enjoyable for those who have basked long enough in
Italy	LOCATION	's smile and learned enough of her nature to compare impressions and to enter upon the little , lovable , silent contro - versies that add so much flavor to literature of this type .

		Hunting for ^ '' * ^ ® ^ ® ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ universal travel and stainedgiass of the almost universal writing of in
France	LOCATION	.

		travel-books , it is unusual to find an author whose point of view is unique or whose subject - matter is unhackneyed .

		But these difficult require - ments seem to be met by Mr.
Charles Hitchcock Sherrill	PERSON	, whose '' Stained Glass Tours in
France	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- furnishes the jaded traveller with a new fad which , if it suits his taste , will at once add zest to and direct his wanderings .

		Mr.
Sherrill	PERSON	states the purpose of his book tersely in his '' fore - word '' : it provides an answer to the question , '' Where does one find good stained glass in
France	LOCATION	, and how can it most conveniently be seen ? ''

		Mr.
Sherrill	PERSON	modestly adds that he is '' not an authority

		THE DIAL 137 on glass -- just a lawyer on a holiday , '' who , having enjoyed his own '' stained glass tours '' thinks that a '' simple touring hand-book '' may help other trav - ellers to enjoy theirs .

		In the interests of simplicity , the glass has been divided into three groups :
thirteenth century	DATE	and earlier , fourteenth and fif - teenth centuries , and sixteenth century ; and for each epoch a tour has been arranged , with a map showing the most convenient order to pursue in visiting the various churches and chateaux .

		Mr.
Sherrill	PERSON	's descriptions of the distinctive windows in each town are simple , non-technical , and interesting .

		The subject of glass is inextricably associated with the more general one of architecture , but Mr.
Sherrill	PERSON	displays a nice sense of proportion in making the necessary connection and yet keeping strictly to his chosen field .

		Some literary ^ ^ ozen essays of varying merit opinions and make up the volume of Professor examinations .


Brander Matthews	PERSON	's '' Inquiries and Opinions '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		Some of them might better have been left to the temporary honor of the popu - lar magazine , to be read and enjoyed and forgotten ; others deserve the doubtful permanence given to-day by publication in book form .

		A short piece of bio - g ^ raphical criticism on
Mark Twain	PERSON	, which has already served as an introduction to a complete edition of that author 's works , aims at giving our greatest American humorist a place in literature among writers of high seriousness , such as Moli ^ re and
Cervantes	PERSON	,
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	and Fielding .

		If he does not equal these mighty ones , our essayist holds , he belongs to their class , though how far down in the class it is for the future to declare .

		In this belief a good many admirers of
Mark Twain	PERSON	will be ready to concur .

		The superiority of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's detective - stories is shown by comparison with the broken - backed productions of Gaboriau , not to mention the '' thrillers '' of the ten-cent magazines .

		It is inter - esting to note that none of these writers has improved in technique upon
Poe	PERSON	, though , as Professor
Matthews	PERSON	says in another essay in this volume , the followers usually improve upon the master in this respect .

		It merely means learning the rules of the game .

		How well
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	has learned these rules in the drama is clearly brought out in the essay on '' Ibsen the Playwright . ''

		He is a consummate craftsman , chief in his own art , however much he may fall short of those great qualities which dis - tinguish Sophocles and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and Molifere .

		An Americanos ``

Revell	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Louis E.	PERSON	of
Poland	LOCATION	.

		YdLii
Norman	PERSON	, is a comprehensive first-hand study of the modern Polish nation , with some account of the history that has made her what she is .

		Mr.
Van Norman	PERSON	visited
Poland	LOCATION	for the '' Review of Reviews . ''

		He was treated with signal honors on various public occasions , and he stayed long enough to learn the language , enter into the life and the ideals of the people , and pay visits to their great men , including
Sienkiewicz	PERSON	.

		His im - pressions of the country make interesting reading , because he is full of his subject and treats it from so many points of view .

		He takes his title from
Victor Hugo	PERSON	's phrase for the role
Poland	LOCATION	has played as militant guardian of the western boundary of European civilization and the Christian faith .

		The relations of dismembered
Poland	LOCATION	with her three mas - ters --
Russia	LOCATION	,
Austria	LOCATION	, and
Prussia	LOCATION	-- are explained in interesting chapters , which have for their sub - structure a close analysis of the Polish national char - acter , with its splendid virtues and fatal defects .

		Several Polish cities are described , including Czen - stochowa , * ' the Mecca of the Poles '' ; while a chapter entitled '' A Voyage over the Steppes '' gives a vivid impression of the rural scenery .

		And to roimd out the picture there is an account of the great patriot
Kosciuszko	PERSON	and of the nation 's leading artists , musicians , and writers , as well as of some distinguished Polish-Americans .

		English domestic An interesting study of domestic architecture t - ` i.i • Tr < ij • • 11 and interior architecture m
England	LOCATION	, prmcipally decoration .

		confined to work of the Gothic and Renascent periods , is presented in the second vol - ume of '' In English Homes '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , a lavishly illustrated quarto for which Mr.
Charles Latham	PERSON	furnishes the photographs and Mr.
H. Avray	PERSON	Tipping the textual comment .

		This last consists of an introductory account of the characteristics of the four periods of English home-building , with the emphasis on the two earlier ones , and of full descriptions of the fifty houses with whose interior decoration and furnishings and exterior appearance Mr.
Latham	PERSON	's pictures make us familiar .

		In most cases , also , a good deal of the history of successive owners of the castles and estates is interwoven with the account of the additions and restorations that they made to their property ; and in a few instances , -- for example ,
Knebworth House	ORGANIZATION	, owned by the Lyttons , -- the interesting family associations seem , to be the chief reason for describing the mansion .

		Mr.
Tipping	PERSON	promises another volume that shall be devoted to buildings of the classic and modern schools , but there are a few wholly modern houses in this collection ; notably Clouds , in
Salisbury	LOCATION	, the crowning labor of
Philip Webb	PERSON	, friend of
Rossetti	PERSON	and
Morris	PERSON	and architect of
Morris	PERSON	's ''
Red House	ORGANIZATION	. '' ''

		The fine quality of Mr.
Latham	PERSON	's work as artist - photographer is well-known .

		For the present vol - ume he furnishes two hundred full-page plates and nearly as many smaller ones .

		The volume is sub - stantially bound in blue buckram .

Jamestown	LOCATION	town Exposition book is '' The Old Exposition .

		South and the New , from the
Earli	LOCATION	- est Times to the
Jamestown	LOCATION	Exposition '' -LRB-
John C. Winston Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It contains over 600 pages , is - printed on heavy white smooth paper , and is pro- fusely illustrated with pictures of Southern people , , scenes , and buildings .

		The text , which contains - nothing new , gives an account of
Southern	ORGANIZATION	history * 138 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, from the beginning to the present time .

		It is written in easy style , has many good anecdotes , and deals mainly with the personal and picturesque elements in
Southern	LOCATION	history .

		The latter part of the book has much about present conditions , -- the race prob - lem , of course , the increasing output of staple crops , the development of mineral and forest wealth , the rise of manufactures and the growth of cities , and finally a history of
Southern Expositions	ORGANIZATION	.

		In spite of the fact that in make-up it resembles the subscrip - tion book , it is better than most works of that kind , and will probably serve a useful purpose in giving some readers a knowledge of the South that they would not get from other accessible authorities .

		It is to be regretted that the author , Mr.
Charles Morris	PERSON	, includes in his volume the classic myths about slavery and
the Southern	ORGANIZATION	aristocracy .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		It is not so uncommon a thing for an author to illus - trate his own book ; but for him also to design the make-up and set the type by hand is certainly unusual .

		This is what Mr.
Ivan Swift	PERSON	has done for his volume entitled '' Fagots of Cedar , '' a collection of verses of the
Michigan	LOCATION	woods and lumber camps , issued in an attrac - tively made limited edition with the imprint of
The Outer	ORGANIZATION	's Book Press of
Milwaukee	LOCATION	.

		At its best Mr.
Swift	PERSON	's verse is virile , rhythmical , and full of meaning , suggesting kinship with the school of Kipling and
Henley	ORGANIZATION	.

		The following French texts have recently come to our desk : Hugo 's `` La L ^ gende des Si ^ cles '' -LRB- Frowde -RRB- , edited by Mr.
G. F. Bridge ; Barbier	PERSON	's `` lambes et Pofemes '' -LRB- Frowde -RRB- , edited by Mr.

Douglas L. Buffum	PERSON	; and
Kenan	PERSON	's `` Ma Sceiu - Henriette '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , edited by Professor
William F. Gr	PERSON	^ se .

		For some strange reason , the collected editions of
Herr Bjomson	PERSON	's novels , as published in both
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, have hitherto failed to include his two most important works of this class .

		One of them , the greatest of all his novels , is now added to the edition published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The work in question , '' In God 's Way , '' fills two volumes in the series edited by Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	.

		The translation by Miss
Elizabeth Carmichael	PERSON	, published somewhat furtively many years ago , is here reproduced , and Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	's introduction even includes the statement that the author '' has not yet approached his sixtieth year . ''

		Since he passed his seventy-fifth birthday last
December	DATE	, some - body is clearly chargeable with slovenliness in the preparation of these volumes for repubUcation .

		The china collector has no occasion nowadays to com - plain of lack of books about his fad , since nearly every month brings him a volume or two on some phase of the fascinating subject of ceramics .

		One of the latest to appear is Mr.
C. H. Wylde	PERSON	's '' How to Collect Continental
China	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The initiated will probably know without being told that the '' collector 's period '' in European porcelains is the end of the seven - teenth century and the eighteenth , since by the year
1810	DATE	the art of china decoration had sadly declined .

		Mr.
Wylde	PERSON	gives the history of all the important old European factories , devoting most space to
Sevres	LOCATION	, where soft paste porcelain reached its perfection , and to
Meissen	LOCATION	, where the use of hard paste was discovered There is also a careful account of the forms and styles of decoration characteristic of the various factories , many of whose productions are reproduced in some of the forty excellent plates .

		The makers ' marks are also reproduced in facsimile .

		Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons are the publishers of '' An Alphabetical Subject Index and Index Encyclo - paedia to Periodical Articles on Religion , 1890-1899 , '' compiled and edited by Mr.
Ernest Cushing Richardson	PERSON	.

		This is a work of enormous industry , forming a volume of nearly twelve himdred closely printed pages , con - taining perhaps seventy tliousand references .

		If this represents the product of only ten years , it is evident that theological discussion does not suffer in our days from any lack of activity .

		Under the word '' Bible '' alone something like a thousand references are indexed .

		The number of periodicals indexed appears to be about fifteen himdred , and they represent all of the culturally important modern languages .

		Mr.
Richardson	PERSON	has had several collaborators in this work , which is one of the most important bibliographical publications of recent years .

		A volume dealing with the work of
Michael Angelo	PERSON	has been added to the familiar '' Drawings of the Great Masters '' series , and - one on Rembrandt , with an intro - duction by
A. M. Hinds	PERSON	, to the similar series called `` Great Etchers '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		The latter contains sixty-one plates arranged chronologically and together making an impressive commentary on the steady develop - ment of
Rembrandt	ORGANIZATION	's genius .

		The introduction com - ments interestingly upon his choice of subjects , his artistic style and methods , and contemporary and present - day estimates of his etchings .

		Mr.
E. Boroughs John	PERSON	- son contributes a commentary upon '' The Drawings of Michsel Angelo , '' pointing out the wonderful draughts - manship and knowledge of human anatomy which are displayed in even the simplest of the cartoons .

		Several of these latter are reproduced in tint .

		Mr.
L. Stanley Jast	PERSON	's `` Classification of Library Economy and Office Papers '' -LRB- and of supplies too , though that is not mentioned in its title -RRB- , will give a fair idea of the manifold details that compose a modern librarian 's daily life and work .

		For instance , -- to choose from both the practical and cultural side of his calling , -- under the head of `` Extension Work '' we find such matters as conferences between the library authorities and other organizations or public bodies , the relations of the library to local factories , exliibitions , circulars , and , of course , work with the schools and with children in general ; and under the head of '' Buildings '' all the various rooms that are needed for the work of the library , including staff rooms and storage rooms , and then the matters of heating , ventilation , and the different kinds of furniture .

		The scheme is worked out as a part of Mr.
J. D. Brown	PERSON	's '' Subject Classification , '' and was first prmted as part of that work ; it has now been issued separately , with a very full index .

		It might be found suggestive to others besides librarians who wish to keep in proper order theii - office papers and other memoranda , or an assortment of stationery suppUes .

		THE DIAL 143 FRANZ QRILLPARZER And the Austrian Drama By
QUSTAV POLLAK MR	PERSON	,
POLLAK	LOCATION	, himself a Viennese by birth , has been a lifelong student of the literatiire and political history of his native land .

		As a contributor to the
New York Nation	ORGANIZATION	since
1874	DATE	, and to the
New York Evening Post	ORGANIZATION	since
1881	DATE	' , he has had abundant opportunity of attesting his familiarity with Austrian topics .

		The volume is an outgrowth of two lectures on '' Austrian Dramatists '' delivered by him at the
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	,
Baltimore	LOCATION	, in
April , 1905	DATE	.

		He has been connected with the editorial revision of various encyclopaedic works , notably the New International Encyclopaedia -LRB- 1902-4 -RRB- and
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	's Encyclopaedia -LRB- 1905-6 -RRB- .

		During the Presidential campaign of 1892 Mr.
Pollak	PERSON	was associated with
Carl Schurz	PERSON	,
Henry Villard	PERSON	,
Oswald Ottendorfer	PERSON	, and other prominent German - Americans in founding in
New York	LOCATION	the '' German-American Reform Union . ''

		OPINIONS OF '' Mr.
Pollak	PERSON	's book is the first attempt , outside of our college world , to introduce
Franz Grillparzer	PERSON	to American readers .

		... As a son of the country which gave birth to the poet .

		Mr.
Pollak	PERSON	is singularly fitted to interpret Grill - parzer 's isolation in life and unique position in letters ... The metrical translations are an important feature of the book .

		With few exceptions they render with uncommon success the meaning and melody of the original . ''

		-- Nation . ''

		In the main , in its triple character of biography , criti - cism , and translation , it is an admirable piece of interpret - ation , and in view of the place which
Grillparzer	PERSON	has come to hold in German literature , it can scarcely be doubted that Mr.
Pollak	PERSON	, in introducing him more fully to the American public , has given us one of the most important books of the season . ''

		-- New York Times . ''

		The intrinsic merit of the book will add dignity to the position it wUl occupy as a pioneer in a little-known field . ''

		--
Chicago Tribune	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` Shows the ardent appreciation of one who has studied deeply into GriUparzer 's work and accomplishments . ''

		Holding the theory that art can be under - stood only in the light of national and international history , and that schools of sculpture were really created by the peoples to whom they appealed , he has given closest attention to sculpture expressive of national feeling , and thus has made a history of sculpture more truly entitled to the name than those which merely tell of the passage of the torch of art from hand to hand .

February 11th , 1908	DATE	: -- Dear Sir , -- It erives me grreat pleasure to tell you liow your paper , PUBLIC OPINION , answers a purpose in nay life .

		Althougrti I read a great deal , I find it impossible to keep abreast of the trend of higrber tbougrbt that Is groiner on around me , which can only be gathered from various articles and letters in newspapers , and articles in magrazines .

		But your paper gives me the assurance that I miss nothing which would be of use to me in the train of thought upon which I may just be engaged , and seldom does a weekly issue of PUBLIC OPINION appear from which I can not cull some useful suggestion .

		As a lecturer on art , I need all the suggestions on life that I can get into my hands , for I treat art in all its phases popularly .

		From PUBLIC OPINION I get to know certain modern authors with whose methods of thinking I am in sympathy , and those I follow up further .

		Your paper does me the service to point to them .

		Your selection of current thought is worthy of all praise , for it gives one the wholesome feeling that the world is , after all , not going to the devil , but contains thinkers and good men and women .

		I wish you , with all my heart , continuous success with your paper .

		Yours very truly , -LRB- Signed -RRB- HUBERT VON HERKOMBB .

		LIST OF NEW BOOKS 190 THU CLOSET DRAMA .

		That stern guardian of the virtues of dramatic art , Professor
Brander Matthews	PERSON	, has long been exercised over the pretensions of the literary play -- that is , of the play which is written to be read rather than to be acted .

		The closet drama , as it is frequently styled , has become a recognized species of our literature , and has acquired an important position through the emi - nence of those English writers who , during the past hundred years or so , have in part devoted their energies to its composition .

		But our critic will none of it ; he calls it a '' bastard-hybrid '' and other offensive names , and , not content with keeping it confined within its closet , he exhibits a ferocious desire to end its existence altogether .

		So zealous a gaoler -LRB- how he will love that spell - ing ! -RRB-

		needs to be watched himself , lest his innocent captive be secretly done to death , or , if perchance its life be spared , its reputation -LRB- that immediate jewel of the soul -RRB- be blasted forever .

		It is against Professor Beers , in particular , that our knight has couched his lance , and the arena of the tourney is found in the
February	DATE	'' North American Review , '' while a sort of side - show is provided for the entertainment of readers of the ''
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' in its issue of the same month .

		Professor Beers having rashly asserted that '' the play house ha .

		`` -RCB- no monopoly of the dramatic form , '' and having further expressed the opinion that '' the English closet-drama of the nineteenth century is an important body of literature , of higher intellectual value than all the stage-plays produced in
England	LOCATION	during the same period , '' a challenge became inevitable , and was promptly delivered .

		The contest rages about a list of works that includes
Byron	PERSON	's `` Manfred , '' George Eliot 's '' Spanish Gypsy , '' Arnold 's '' Empedocles on
Etna	ORGANIZATION	, ''
Tennyson	PERSON	's ''
Becket	PERSON	, ''
Browning	PERSON	's ``
Pippa Passes	PERSON	, ''
Swinburne	PERSON	's `` At - alanta , '' and Landor 's '' Gebir , '' although we do not quite see what the last-named epic is doing in cette goTere .

		These , of course , are only a few typical examples of the great number of works cast in the dramatic mould that have a secure position in our nineteenth-century literature .

		The list , properly amplified , would seem to the plain man fully to justify the claims made by Mr.
Beers	PERSON	164 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, for this category of creative work .

		Nor does Mr.
Matthews	PERSON	deny outright the importance of the poems in question .

		But he seeks to min - imise the sigificance of the list by eliminating from it two kinds of plays -- those that their authors really hoped might be acted , and those that are no more than imitations of ancient models -- and then disposing of the rest by remarking that they might be blotted out of ex - istence '' without greatly impairing the renown of the English poets who have condescended to the poem in dialogue . '' ''

		Condescended '' is good , but it seems to beg the question ; the demolition is very neat , in theory , but some - how it leaves `` Becket '' and `` Atalanta '' and '' Manfred '' with all their old compelling power upon our imagination .

		We recall the stage presentation of '' Becket '' as one of the most im - pressive we have ever seen ; we think enviously of the
London	LOCATION	audience that was privileged to witness '' Atalanta '' not long ago , and we are by no means sure that a performance of '' Manfred '' would not be the occasion of a joy - ous experience -- its joy perhaps enhanced by the knowledge that it was counted illegitimate by the doctrinaires of dramaturgy .

		Mr.
Beers	PERSON	reminds us that the closet drar matist has '' a freer hand than the professional playwright , '' pointing out the obvious advan - tages of a form that '' has not need to sacrifice truth of character and probability of plot to the need of highly accentuated situations , '' and that is not constrained to make swift development of dramatic action the be-all and end-all of its aim .

		The position seems to us impregnable ; certainly it is not carried by assault by hurling such epithets as '' wilful perversity , '' '' shrinking weakling , '' and '' anarchists in art '' at its defenders .

		Mr.
Matthews	PERSON	is a warm admirer of French dramatic literature and a recognized authority upon the subject , but the canons of criticism which lead him to condemn the English closet-drama woidd , if logically applied , con - demn also the masterpieces of Corneille and
Racine	LOCATION	.

		There is no place for recits de Theramene in the legitimate drama as he now seeks to circumscribe its activities .

		His narrow definition admits
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	alone of the three great Frenchmen , and leaves much of Hugo and
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, and no little of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, in the outer darkness .

		The stage-scene in which there is '' nothing doing '' is his pet abhorrence , for he ignores the possibility that there may be a great deal '' doing '' in the mind of the listening spec - tator .

		For our own part , we confess to have derived acute pleasure from the stage deliverance of
Faust	LOCATION	's opening monologue , the parable of ''
Nathan der Weise	PERSON	, '' the invocation to the spirit of Charlemagne in '' Hernani , '' the scathing denunciation of the courtiers in '' Ruy Bias , '' and many a tirade of classical French tragedy .

		We might possibly balk at
John Knox	PERSON	's sermon in ''
Bothwell	PERSON	, '' but are not quite sure of even that , never having been put to the test .

		And , to take the most conspicuous of modern instances , we would rather witness a performance of Ibsen 's '' Brand '' than a wilder - ness of '' Doll Houses '' and ''
Hedda Gablers	PERSON	. ''

		To this point , we are prepared to defend the legitimacy of the stage-play that does not limit its effects to crisp dialogue and swiftly-moving action .

		These things are
weU	ORGANIZATION	, but the play is dust and ashes that does not also provide its seasons of recueillement and aim at something more than excitement .

		The modem English stage has deliberately divorced itself from liter - ature , and has no reason to complain because literature chooses to preserve for itself whatever traditions and habits of the old alliance it may still find fitted for its purpose .

		That the divorce proceedings have been instituted by the stage is practically admitted by Mr.
Matthews	PERSON	.

		He says : '' The drama has cast out all that is undramatic and it now has no room for anything but the action and the characters .

		It is compacter than ever before ; and it rejects not only description but also narrative . ''

		Precisely so .

		But the poet , whose claim upon the dramatic form is primary , refuses to abandon that form to the commercial - ized mercies of the stage-manager , and , with strange perversity , refuses also to write for the stage under such limitations .

		The great Greeks and the great Frenchmen and the great Ger - mans and the great Englishmen of our one great dramatic epoch found the stage a suitable place for both description and narrative , and the modern Englishman who seeks to follow in their footsteps , although he would willingly make some concessions to stagecraft , is completely alienated by the non possumus attitude of the manager .

		Thus freed to follow his own devices , he produces literature that is dramatic in sem - blance , but that takes little thought of exits and entrances and stage groupings , or of histrionism in general .

		His work is given to the world in the form of '' The
Cenci	PERSON	, '' or of '' Count
Julian	PERSON	, ' or of '' Philip van Artevelde , '' and this is the closet drama the right of which to exist Mr.
Matthews	PERSON	so stoutly denies .

		Our critic speaks no more than the truth when he says that '' behind every appearance of the closet drama we can discover a latent con -
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 165 tempt for the actual theatre , '' but few will follow him in discovering as well '' a desire to claim its rewards . ''

		It may be held as a pious opinion by the closet dramatist that the ideally - constituted theatre of sbme Utopian realm would reward his work in the measure of its beauty and truth , but he knows full well that his own audience will be one of readers only , and that his own rewards -LRB- materially viewed -RRB- will come from royalties on books and not on productions .

		The stage conditions of the last half - century or more have been so utterly discouraging to the serious English writer of dramatic bent that he has taken the only course befitting his dignity , and has written his plays for print alone .

		He has missed thereby the tribute of nightly applause in the playhouse , but he has cherished instead the consoling thought that his work had a fair chance of living as a part of English liter - ature .

		And that is the one thing not likely to be asserted concerning the English plays of the same period that have borne , however triumph - antly , the test of the footlights .

		PERSONALITY VS. WORK .

		There is a story of a ship sailing north which sights a huge black rock and in an instant all its nails and iron-work are drawn out and the vessel falls into pieces .

		Contemporary literary criticism makes shipwreck on the magnetic rock of personality .

		It can not keep its steerage way or bearings , or even stay afloat , when confronted by a dominating character .

		At first glance it would seem a matter of indiffer - ence to the world as to what manner of being it is who presents it with a work of art .

		We do not inquire of our butchers and bakers and candlestick - makers whether they have red hair and bandy legs , or a Bluebeard closet full of wives , or drain the flowing bowl in their leisure moments .

		All such facts , if true of literary genius , doubtless have a subtle influence on its work .

		But it is difficult to trace such influence out .

		The criticism of gossip , of which Sainte-Beuve was the great modern master , fails utterly to explain the inexplicable genesis of literary creation .

		It ignores the inspiration , the gift , the unknown power of intellect and feeling which makes all the difference between one man and another .

		The experience of a genius is paral - leled by that of myriads of his fellows .

		His ability to change this experience into artistic creations is his own .

		Biography is one of the most fascinating forms of literatiu-e , and the biographies of men of letters are the best of all .

		When they are both dismissed from life 's stage the man of action must yield pre - cedence to the man of thought .

		A handful of songs can sanctify a whole region ; the birthplace of a great romance writer can draw curious crowds whom a battlefield would leave cold .

		The danger is that our interest in the makers of literature themselves is likely to take the place of interest in their work .

		We make pilgrimages to the places where they dwelt , and leave their books unread ; we handle the relics of their material life , and forget to be stirred or raised by their spiritual revelations ; we talk to rags the circumstances of
Shelley	PERSON	's life , while '' Adonais '' and '' Prometheus Unbound '' sleep on the shelf ; we discuss
Poe	PERSON	's inebriety , and forget his art .

		This might be thought the flattery of fame were it not that scandal is our usual quest .

		We dig in the dirt like pigs that have been trained to hunt for truffles .

		Antiquity knew nothing of this insatiate curiosity .

		It usually gave its poets and thinkers about as many lines of biography as we give volumes .

		The huge monuments of poetry and philosophy rose in sight of everyone , while the men who reared them were but a name .

		But the personality of writers affects contempo - raries not by the means of biography , but by actual presence , -- by rumor or report or by a sort of aura which envelops their works .

		And this personality may be attractive , repellant , or neutral .

		The attractive personality in literature wins his place in human regard by a variety of methods .

		Sometimes he is the mere voice of the crowd -- the personification of its passing moods and desires .

		He sees , perhaps a little earlier than the rest of
man %	PERCENT	kind , what winds and tides are like to prevail , and steers and spreads his sail for them .

		He seems to lead , though in reality he follows , like the rest , the impulse of the hour .

		He is the exponent of the Zeitgeist , and as such very often does a noble and important work .

		And he is always valuable his - torically as indicating the direction and interests of tlie human mind at any given time .

		Probably the greater number of the heirs of fame are of this kind .

		They are the favorites of fortune .

		Like the brazen gate fronting the sun , they receive and render back its rays .

		Popular poets , novelists , rhetoricians in religion or politics , are all of this kind .

		The danger they are exposed to is of a too easy success which relaxes the fibre of heroic effort .

		Their view of life is likely to be shallow and trivial .

		Or the Zeitgeist of the new age eats up the Zeitgeist of the last , and they are forgotten .

		Of a somewhat similar kind are the reformers in literature -- who , coming at a time when one good custom has corrupted the world , when the gods have hardened into idols , when formalism has replaced spirituality , gather a revolting crowd about them , burst into the sacred places , and smash the images .

		Such iconoclasts , if successful , win an even more enthusiastic regard and a greater reward than they who burn incense to the deities in power .

		A com - mon danger binds their followers to them , and their courage makes them kings .

		The revolt of Words - worth and his comrades against the conventional in English literature , and that of Hugo and
Dumas	PERSON	in French , are cases in point .

		166 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, A minor kind of personality which achieves pop - ularity is that of the humorist who does not presume .

		A writer who makes himself the subject of his own satire , who tacitly assumes the superiority of his readers or audience , is sure to please .

		The public , proud of patronizing , takes such a personality under its protection .

		Such humility may be a very noble thing , and when allied with great intellectual power exercises a rightful charm . ''

		I will speak harm of no one save myself of whom I know the most ill , '' is one of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's sweetest speeches .

		Most of the humorists who have won the hearts of their con - temporaries have been deeply imbued with this feeling .

		One only needs to name
Goldsmith	PERSON	,
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	, and Irving .

		Once in a great while a personality appears in literature of such beauty , splendor , or stateliness as to attract all eyes and enthrone himself in the admi - ration of mankind .

		In spite of envy and hatred which try to do him wrong , general opinion doffs its cap to him .

		The world seems to recognize in him a daemonic character lifted above the ordinary levels of life .

		It sees in him an incarnation of power and success .

		Modem
Europe	LOCATION	has perhaps produced no more than two men of this kind -- Goethe and
Byron	PERSON	.

		Voltaire and
Swift	ORGANIZATION	exercised almost as great a personal influence , but they lacked nearly all the gifts of nature and fortune which those fav - ored two possessed .

		* Counterfeit presentments of personality there always are in plenty .

		Many authors and artists , for advertising purposes , adopt eccentricities of dress or manner or character .

		But such masquerades do not mean much .

		The repellant personalities , -- the men of genius who in life excite the active dislike of their fellows , who are reviled , persecuted , banished , -- number in their ranks many of the greatest names in literature .

		They are the high and haughty souls , who , confident in their own strength , hold aloof from mankind .

		They are the logicians who syllogize hateful truths .

		They are the satirists and dealers in irony .

		Irony -- the appearance of things propitious , the reality of things malign -- seems to excite the anger of man - kind even more than satire or disdain .

		^ schylus ,
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, and
Milton	PERSON	are the great exemplars of the kind of genius whose soul is as a star and dwells apart .

		Their contemporaries were very willing to have them keep theii * distance , and helped them to do so by persecution and exile .

		In all such cases of misunderstanding the pity is to be divided between the great figure and his puny fellows .

		Human beings have their inevitable duties , joys , sorrows , and sins .

		They tend to drag down - ward into the darkness and resent being spurred upward into the light .

		They look to their literary chiefs for sympathy and flattery , and they hate the clarion call which rouses them to high endeavor .

		Yet when GuUiver appears in
Lilliput	LOCATION	what can he make of the pygmy multitude ?

		The little messes which satisfy their appetites , the little round of duties which occupy their days , the toys which satisfy their ambitions , -- what are these to him ?

		A type of genius , higher yet , perhaps , than that possessed by the prophetic souls I have named , has known how to reconcile the infinitely great and the immeasur - ably little .

		But it has been at the cost , wliich
Dante	ORGANIZATION	or
Milton	PERSON	would not pay , of sinking its own individuality .

		The masters of the ironic strain in literature have been driven to many devices to get any acceptance at all from their audiences .

		Aristophanes and Rabelais disguised their mockery in filth , yet it is diffictilt to believe that either of them was personally popular .

		Defoe wrote an ironical essay on '' An Easy Way with Dissenters '' which was taken for a plain straightforward proposition .

		Probably noth - ing did so much to fix the charge of brutality upon Swift as his suggestion for the economical utilization of Irish infants .

		The most mysterious instance of a great character made repellant to his countrymen by subtle irony is that of Cervantes .

		Here was a hero among heroes , an
Hidalgo	LOCATION	among Hidalgos , -- one almost , to borrow a fine phrase about a more sacred personage , '' the first true gentleman who ever lived . ''

		He was dow - ered with sweetness , gentleness , fortitude , patience .

		His motto was `` Patience , and shuffle the cards . ''

		Yet he got few honors and scant reward from his native land .

		The stately Spaniard , accustomed to being flattered to the top of his bent by Lope and
Calderon	PERSON	, must have felt that
Cervantes	PERSON	was laugh - ing in his sleeve at him .

		And so he thrust aside the poet who was the incarnation of Spanish courage and courtesy and loftiness of soul .

		In one of
Keats	PERSON	's most brilliant letters he says that the characteristic of the highest type of literary genius is to have no character at all .

		It must have no decided domineering force of its own which might interfere with its receptivity to outward impressions .

		Keats speaks of himself as having been overwhelmed by the personality of a chUd .

		The neutral per - sonages of literature are undoubtedly thus made .

		They sink themselves in their work .

		They go about the world , as it were , incognito , watching the pas - sions and humors of men , and passively reflecting like a mirror the phenomena of nature and human - ity .

		They are like Apollo among the shepherds of Admetus , like Haroun al-Raschid prowling about the streets of
Bagdad	LOCATION	in disguise .

		Of course , back of this seeming passivity of impression , is the mighty mind always at work combining and recreating .

		And this mind is so mighty , so conscious of its divine power , that it is indifferent to the outward accidents which befall it .

		How should the man who was meditating '' King Lear '' feel any personal con - cern in the intrigues and bustle of the life about him I How should he care whether he had precedence at Court or place in the ranks of the nobles of the day !

		How should the man who had created
Rosalind	PERSON	and
Imogen	PERSON	care whether this maid of honor or that city dame smiled upon him or not !

		We know that he did care to a certain extent for such things , but it is doubtful whether his interest was deep enough to
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 167 make him exert his energies in actual life .

		Possibly the reason we know so little about him is that there was little to know -- that he strove with none , for none was worth his strife .

		Certainly he made no effort to impress his personality upon his contem - poraries .

		He laughed and drank with his fellows , helped them to their triumphs , accepted good - naturedly his eclipse by
Ben Jonson	PERSON	and
Fletcher	PERSON	-- because , in all probability , he was the only man in that day conscious of the greatness of his work .

		Can we doubt that
Homer	PERSON	, the man , whoever he was , who fused the legends and traditions of the Greek race into one splendid and vital whole , was a being of the same order ?

		We know that
Virgil	PERSON	, the per - fect artist , was , for we have glimpses of him , shy and secluded , careless of his surroundings , indiffer - ent as to his place in Roman society while he was brooding over the dream which was to make
Rome	LOCATION	immortal .

		Horace probably impressed himself a hundred times as much upon the people about him .

		Great is the power of personality , -- pervasive its charm when it pleases , dreadful its doom when it does not .

		But , in the main , it is only a temporary force in literature .

		It speedily fades into tradition or else solidifies into biography , which is a new lit - erary creation .

		Character is the scaffolding by means of which the houses and palaces and temples of art are erected .

		When these are done , -- unless the architecture is bad indeed , -- it is fitting that the beams and timbers which helped in the building should be taken down and the structures themselves revealed to view .

		The work is , after all , the thing .

		Personality is an uncertain quantity -- the subject of conjecture and interpretation .

		But work is sure and lasting in its effect -- as lasting as the human nature it depicts , as the generations of men who enjoy it .

		And it is apprizable .

		The great produc - tions of literature can be brought from the four quarters of the world , from the utmost distances of time , set side by side and judged and placed and ranked .


Charles Leonard Moore	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		The endless possibilities of library improve - ment , even in the best of our libraries , and the unceasing demands for more money with which to realize these possibilities , make one aware that the public library is still evolving -- has by no means yet reached the stage of stagnant perfection .

		While Dr.
Steiner	PERSON	, of the
Enoch Pratt Free Library	ORGANIZATION	, of
Baltimore	LOCATION	, rejoices in the pros - pect of new branch libraries to add to the present eight , and to be paid for out of Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	's recent gener - ous half-million-dollar gift , he nevertheless longs for a larger and better-appointed central building .

		In the matter of reading-room alone , he is reported as saying : '' I would like to enlarge it and divide it into depart - ments .

		I would like to make its accommodations greater and better , and I would like to break it up into ' chil - dren 's , ' `` student 's , ' ' general , ' and ' shelf ' rooms . ''

		Each of these rooms are described by him as he sees them in his mind 's eye , and of the last-named he says : '' When I speak of a • shelf ' room I mean one where the books are on the walls vmconfined , to be taken by the reader without application to an attendant .

		This worthy could sit at a little wicket by the door to see that nothing was stolen .

		Such a room as this would offer the advantages of freedom and wide selection .

		It is often very annoying to have to go through the formalities that are now in existence here to get books .

		It quite interrupts your thought sometimes , and puts you out of humor for a long while .

		Then , when you get what you have applied for , often you do n't want it .

		A hasty glance through the contents convinces you that they are worthless .

		Then you have to order again and lose much time in the process .

		All this could be avoided in a ' shelf ' room where you could get what you wanted when you wanted it , and where you could be sure always of what you were getting . ''

		Careful selection and frequent change of books thus exposed would be necessary , as Dr.
Steiner	PERSON	goes on to explain ; and further : `` The visitors to such a sanctum would have to be of a class that valued books and that read really for the pleasure of reading , and not for the sake of spending a boresome half-hour .

		I would regard the place as the choicest part of the library -- a sort of holy of holies , where individuals of kindred taste could meet on a sure high ground . ''

		Would that these plans might be carried out !


Baltimore	LOCATION	deserves better things at the hands of its appropriations committee ; for whereas , in
1906	DATE	,
Chicago	LOCATION	devoted
$ 300,000	MONEY	to library uses ,
Boston	ORGANIZATION
$ 325,550	MONEY	, and
Pittsburgh	LOCATION	$ 200,000 , Bal - timore 's appropriation has for twenty-two years not exceeded
$ 50,000	MONEY	... A COCKPIT FOR LITERARY COMBATS has been play - fully proposed by that fertile-brained , indefatigable , always suggestive writer on all things in heaven and earth , and a few besides , -- Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	.

		He suggests that '' if a capitalist of disinterested character could be enlisted , '' a special paper , '' The Cockpit , '' might be established for the frcQ discussion and final adjustment of differences between authors and critics . ''

		I remember , '' he says -LRB- in the
London	LOCATION	'' Morning Post '' -RRB- in some remarks leading up to this suggestion , '' meeting Mr.
Browning	PERSON	once , when he was in an indig - nant mood .

		A critic , a very eminent , courteous , and honorable critic , had reviewed his new poem , had printed extracts , and had complained that they were very obscure .

		No wonder , for the critic had inadvert - ently misprinted them so as to render them wholly unintelligible .

		I could not convince Mr.
Browning	PERSON	, who did not know the reviewer , that the error , though de - plorable , was accidental .

		Now , would Mr.
Browning	PERSON	have been to blame if he had drawn the reviewer 's atten - tion to the correct text of his verses ?

		Then the blimder would have been acknowledged , with apologies .

		This was a very unusual case , in belles-lettres .

		In historical and scientific matter I can not but think that discussion is valuable to author , critic , and readers .

		If the critic is in the wrong , why should the author , in dignified sulks , leave him and his readers in the dark ?

		It is all very well to talk about ' waitmg the verdict of time and of science . '

		But their wheels move so slowly that they need to be accelerated , and they may be accelerated by discussion .

		There is , indeed , no other method .

		Suppose that the critic , however plausible his argument may seem , is in the wrong , and that the author can prove it .

		To remain in the wrong is the last thing that the critic desires .

		Yet perhaps nobody but the author can put him in the right , and , for want of discussion , he may carry his gray hairs to the grave under a misapprehen - 168 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, sion of Xavili Athanasianism , while the world may be equally deceived , sharing his illusion . ''

		Very sane and sensible .

		So long as all acrimony , all personal feeling , can be kept out of such discussions between authors and critics , they are to be encouraged , in the interests of truth and fairness . ''

		Answering back , '' on the other hand , only leaves a bitter taste in the mouth ; and though it sometimes seems to contribute to the gaiety of nations , the mirth aroused is Satanic .

		• • • The eloquent shrug of
Omar Khayyam	PERSON	may not be familiar to all readers .

		In his recent American visit Mr.
William Archer	PERSON	was congratulated by a young actress on the never-failing fairness of his reviews -- a fairness difficult for a dramatic critic , or any critic , to maintain . ''

		To be fair , '' said Mr.
Archer	PERSON	, '' is some - times hard and cruel , and sometimes it is rash .

		The unswervingly fair critic often takes up his pen with the shrug of Omar , the old Persian poet .

		You have heard of Omar 's shrug ?

		No ?

		Well , it was eloquent .

		The
Shah	PERSON	one day sent for the old poet . '

		Omar , ' said he , ' I have written some verses .

		Listen and I will read them to you . '

		And he read the verses , and in the ensuing silence looked at Omar anxiously .

		* Well ? '

		he said . '

		Heaven-born , ' replied Omar gently , ' each to his own calling .

		Sceptre in hand , you are most wise , just , and powerful ; but pen in hand -- ' Omar shook his head . '

		Heaven-born , ' he continued , ' such verses would disgrace a nine-year-old schoolboy . '

		His eyes flashing with rage , the
Shah	PERSON	shouted to his guards : * To the stables with this old fool , and let him be soundly flogged . '

		Yet the
Shah	PERSON	, for all that , respected Omar 's judgment , and a week later he sent for the fearless and fair critic again . '

		Another poem ,
Omar	PERSON	, ' he said . '

		A better one , I 'm sure you '11 think it is a better one , ' he added wistfully .

		And he began to read the second poem to the old man .

		But in the middle of the reading Omar turned and started for the door . '

		Where are you going ? '

		demanded the
Shah	ORGANIZATION	in amazement .

		Omar looked back and shrugged his shoulders . '

		To the stables , ' he answered , ' for another flogging . ' ''

		And did this would-be poet then comfort himself with repeating those scornful words of another merciless flogger of critics , -- '' as soon seek roses in
December	DATE	, ice in
June	DATE	, hope constancy in wind , or corn in chaff , believe a woman or an epitaph , or any other thing that 's false , before you trust in critics '' ?

		Probably the
Shah	PERSON	was guilty of no such anachronism ,
Byron	PERSON	and the '' English Bards '' being still some seven hundred years in the futiire .

		... The old-fashioned librarian , who has been made the subject of some recent comment and correspondence in our pages , is again discussed by the editor of the lib - rary department of the
Boston	LOCATION	'' Transcript . ''

		Instead of answering directly our correspondent 's complaint of the decay of the literature-loving custodian of books , the
Boston	LOCATION	writer thinks it better , as he says , '' to quote a few sentences from that storehouse of information con - cerning the maimers and customs of the librarian of a past generation -- that rare old work , ' The Old Libra ^ - rian 's Almanac ' '' So delicious is the flavor of the passage that it must be here reprinted in full . ''

		You shall chuse your Books with Care and Circumspection .

		When you have determiu 'd that it is Prudent to pur - chase a certain Work , do so cautiously and make a Shrewd Bargain with the Vendor .

		It will then be your Duty to Peruse the Volume , even if -LRB- as doubtless will be the Fact -RRB- you have scan 'd it before Buying .

		Do not let the Importunities of Persons who come to the Library hasten you in the Performance of this Task .

		They should be Content to wait for the Book until you have Satisfied yourself of its Contents .

		There will then remain the Necessity of recording its Acquisition in your
Ledgers of Record	ORGANIZATION	.

		As for the Entry of its Style and Title in the Catalogue , many coimsel that this is not needful , since you may be expected to remember that the Book has been Purchas 'd for the Library .

		Some would advise that if it be a volume of Sermons it be placed on the Shelves with others of its like ; or if it be a work of
Natural Philosophy	ORGANIZATION	it stand near the volumes of that class .

		This is a waste of Labour .

		Assign it a Number which shall Correspond to its Position on the Shelf , and shall be the next in sequence from the latest Book which you have added , and so let them stand in the order in which they are
Receiv 'd	ORGANIZATION	.

		For , surely , if you desire to find a number of volumes of Sermons , it wUl be an easy matter for you , recalling when they were Purchas 'd , to pluck them from their several resting-places .

		Keep your Books behind stout Gratings , and in no wise let any Person come at them to take them from the shelf except yourself '' We have heard of a librarian who , to insure his tenure of office , refused to issue a catalogue of the collection in his charge .

		He must have been a faithful reader of '' The Old Librarian 's Almanac . ''

		...
Chicago	LOCATION	as a centre for library extension has advantages that were recognized by the
League of State Library Commissions	ORGANIZATION	at its mid-winter meeting in this city .

		On that occasion the following resolution was passed : `` Inasmuch as a possible transfer of
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	headquarters has been under con - sideration by the council and executive board , and inasmuch as the greatest profit which can be derived through national headquarters is in furtherance of lib - rary extension , it is hereby declared the sense of those present at this
League of Library Commissions	ORGANIZATION	that such headquarters ought to be located with special reference to the extension of library interests in those sections of the country where efforts promise the greatest possibili - ties .

		We therefore respectfully submit for the con - sideration of the executive committee the advisability of selecting
Chicago	LOCATION	as the location for
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	headquarters .

		The central location of
Chicago	LOCATION	affords greater convenience of access to a larger number of the members of the
American Librai-y Association	ORGANIZATION	than any other city under consideration , and the fact that it is the natural gathering point in the region which is likely to prove in the next decade the chief seat of library extension gives added force to the argument for its selection . ''

		Although the centre of population is now considerably to the eastward of
Chicago	LOCATION	, that centre is steadily moving westward , and thus
Chicago	LOCATION	is likely for a long time to come to prove an increasingly desirable situation for the proposed headquarters .

		... The press and the people stand in a close and curious relation to each other .

		In a current magazine article on '' The Newspaper as it is , '' by Gen.
Charles H. Taylor	PERSON	of the
Boston	LOCATION	`` Globe , '' he says : `` Our papers are what the people make them .

		The public decides what it wishes to read ; the editors and publishers , trained in their business , gather their raw material and work it into the finished product , news , to meet the demand . ''

		We protest that this is putting journaUsm on a level with manufactures .

		The law of supply and
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 169 demand can not , of course , be ignored by a journal that has to be self-supporting ; but no great editor has ever let his readers lead him by the nose .

		Did
Greeley	PERSON	or Bryant or
Dana	PERSON	let the people piake their respective papers for them ?

		No journalist is worthy of his calling who simply lays his ear to the ground and then writes what he hears the populace clamoring for .

		But General
Taylor	PERSON	rises to higher levels in a succeeding paragraph , in which he well says : '' Journalists have a much heavier responsibihty than any other business men .

		The idle , the self-seeking , the untruthful , the vicious , beguile them at every hand , to use the powerful engine of the press to carry them a little way along their chosen road .

		The editor must watch ceaselessly for these unwelcome passengers and eject them on sight .

		He appreciates the responsibility of his trust .

		He reaches his ideal as nearly as he can , and does far more for the morals of the community than he is usually given credit for . ''

		Some conception of the influence of the press may be formed from the fact that there were last year pub - lished in this country alone 21,535 periodicals of all kinds , daily , weekly , monthly , etc. ; and from recent statistics it is estimated by General
Taylor	PERSON	that the total circulation of the newspapers of the country in
1907	DATE	was not less than ten billion copies .

		Another significant fact is that the world 's issue of papers in the English lan - guage exceeds that of all others combined .

		A GUIDE TO CURRENT FRENCH BOOKS , authoritative , and presumably '' safe '' for use in buying for family or public library purposes , seems to have been discovered by Mr.
George F. Bowermau	PERSON	, librarian of the
Washington	LOCATION	Public Library , in the course of a recent study of the eighty-two free popular libraries scattered through the twenty wards -LRB- arrondissments -RRB- of
Paris	LOCATION	His paper on '' The Municipal Popular Libraries of
Paris	LOCATION	, '' read be - fore the
District of Columbia Library Association	ORGANIZATION	last
October	DATE	, published in '' The Library Journal '' of Jan - uary , and now reprinted and issued as a separate leaflet , contains much interesting information on French public libraries .

		Its wealth of matter can not be squeezed into a paragraph ; therefore we will simply add a few more words about the book-list referred to above .

		Mr.
Bowerman	PERSON	says : '' One of the most interesting features of this library system -LSB- of
Paris	LOCATION	-RSB- , and the one which will , perhaps , afford most practical help to American public libraries , is that which has to do with the choice of books .

		One of the most important functions of the central commission is the annual publication of a list of books accepted as suitable for these mimicipal libraries .

		It is from these lists that all accessions to the various libra - ries must be chosen . ''

		The list for
1907	DATE	contained 273 titles , besides periodicals , fiction covering 52 titles ; '' literature , '' 51 ; sciences , art , and education , 49 ; history , geography , and travel , 66 ; and other branches a lesser number .

		Advance requests for copies of these annual lists would probably receive courteous consideration .

		At present the number printed is limited .

		M. Rupert Pr ^ cy , Chief of the
Central Service	ORGANIZATION	of Municipal Li - braries , appears from Mr.
Bowerman	PERSON	's paper to be the proper official to approach .

		• • • The YELLOWNESS OF YELLOW JOURNALISM is learn - edly discussed in a current magazine article by Professor
W. I. Thomas	PERSON	of
Chicago University	ORGANIZATION	.

		He argues , with a considerable use of the psychological laboratory termi - nology , that '' the yellow feature of journalism '' owes its existence to '' the interest attaching to the disastrous .

		If a yellow sheet be analyzed , it will be foimd that it handles events and persons from the pain or disaster standpoint .

		The event itself is of no significance .

		The loss of life , the loss of happiness , the loss of property , the loss of reputation , death and detraction , is the whole story .

		In a word , it is an appeal to the hate reflex . ''

		This elemental savage instinct , to which , as well as to other primitive and often tmlovely instincts , man owes his survival , is probably at the bottom of that irrational and indefensible exultation that is not seldom felt in the misfortunes of others , even though those others be neighbors , friends , or even near relatives .

		La Roche - foucauld 's pithy expression of this sad tendency of frail humanity is placed at the head of Professor
Thomas	PERSON	's article .

		He defends his thesis rather con - vincingly , but fails , it must seem to many readers , to attach enough importance to that mere , idle , good - natured curiosity , that insatiable hunger for something new , that prompts many a kind-hearted and well-meaning person to buy the
Uveliest	LOCATION	, most sensationally-headlined newspaper his penny will procure .

		Human nature can not be so utterly corrupt that we go about thirsting for the blood and eager for the shame of our fellow-men with quite such avidity as Professor
Thomas	PERSON	would have us believe .

		, '' , Of INTEREST TO DICTIONARY-BUYERS and dictionary - sellers is a little leaflet , sent out by the
G. & C. Merriam Company	ORGANIZATION	, publishers of
Webster	PERSON	's dictionaries , wherein is given in full the late decision of the
United States Circuit Court of Appeals	ORGANIZATION	in the case of said company against
George W. Ogilvie	PERSON	, also a publisher of diction - aries .

		Though imitation is the sincerest form of flattery , Mr.
Ogilvie	PERSON	's emulous patterning of his own dictionary after the model furnished by the Messrs.
Merriam	PERSON	, and especially his manifest admiration of these gentlemen 's taste in the matter of title-page and covers and label , have proved a species of blandishment inoperative on that love of adulation which he evidently , and most naturally , had counted on as existent in the bosoms of the
Merriam	LOCATION	brothers .

		And , worst of all ,
the Court of Appeals	ORGANIZATION	has shown itself as little genial in this respect as the
Merriams	LOCATION	; for , to quote from the leaflet 's sum - mary of the decision , '' it reverses the decision of the
Circuit Court	ORGANIZATION	, rendered a year ago , orders an injunction against the further sale of
Ogilvie	ORGANIZATION	's dictionary with the title-page and covers ' in the present form , or in any form calculated to deceive members of the public into purchasing his dictionary under the belief that it is a
Merriam Webster	PERSON	's Dictionary , ' and remands the case to the
Circuit Court	ORGANIZATION	to pass upon the question of an accounting for the profits upon dictionaries which have been sold by
Ogilvie	PERSON	up to this date . ''

		Statesmanship and the love of poetry are often found happily conjoined .

		Instances of apt quotations from the poets , manifestly impromptu and in quick reply to an opponent , on the floor of the British Parliament , and , less often , in our own congressional halls , would fill a book , or at least a small one .

		Another proof of the affinity for classic poetry that is sometimes felt by the man engaged in public legislative , administrative , or judicial pursuits was furnished , in his old age , by the fourteenth
Earl of Derby	ORGANIZATION	, who occupied the leisure of his later years in turning Homer 's '' Iliad '' into blank verse .

		Almost half a century before , it is worth noting , he had gained the Chancellor 's Latin verse prize at
Oxford	LOCATION	, his subject being `` Syracuse . ''

		Ex-Secretary Long , in the days when he was better known as 170 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, Governor Long , beguiled the tedium of a
summer	DATE	vaca - tion -LRB- or was it several summers , and some winters besides ? -RRB-

		by making a metrical translation of the '' ^ neid . ''

		And now there has just appeared , from the pen of the Rt. .

		Hon. Sir
S. W. Griffith	PERSON	, Chief Justice of the Australian Commonwealth , a new English version , in the metre of the original , of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's never-to-be - enough-translated `` Inferno . ''

		Almost as pleasing a spectacle as it would be to see philosophers ruling over the nations is it to behold poets and the translators of poets making the nations ' laws .

		The oldtime spelling bee is expected to buzz with renewed energy now that one
Varnum Lincohi	PERSON	, late of
Andover	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, has bequeathed to his native town the sum of
five hundred dollars	MONEY	to found a perpetual spell - ing match .

		Once a year , according to the terms of the will , this contest in orthography shall be held in some public hall or place near the centre of the town , at or near the close of the winter term of the public schools .

		It must be conducted under the care and supervision of the school committee of the town , the public to be admitted free of charge .

		The contestants must be between the ages of ten and eighteen years , and the ancient method of '' choosing sides '' must be followed .

		Prizes of ten , six , and four dollars are to be given to the three best spellers .

		So far , so good ; but why did not the testator provide against time-wasting disputes and much possible hard feeling by stipulating that his old - fashioned spelling bee should follow the old-fashioned spelling ?

		A town divided against itself -- one faction clinging to
Webster	PERSON	, and the rest blown about by every wind of doctrine in the matter of spellmg -- would be a harrowing spectacle .

		Manifestly , Mr.
Varnum Lincoln	PERSON	did not rise to the level of his opportunity .

		• • • Aluminum for books for the blind is the latest application of that light and attractive metal .

		It is rolled into thin sheets and embossed , in the same way that paper is embossed , with the raised characters used for the blind .

		Aluminum books are now being printed in

		The one draw - back is the expense of manufacture .

		Before these books shall have been brought within the more general reach of the blind it is to be hoped that the blind , or their teachers , will unite on some one alphabet , out of the several now in use .

		`` THE OLD-FASHIONED LIBRARIAN '' ONCE MORE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dla.l . -RRB-

		In addition to the very courteous reply which Mr.
Arthur L. Bailey	PERSON	made to my letter appearing in The Dial of
February 1	DATE	, there have been a number of other responses , through personal notes and in public print , some gratefully sympathetic , others ebullitions worthy of a greater problem .

		These latter , one and all , mis - read my letter and charge me , to use the words of the
Boston	LOCATION	'' Transcript , '' with '' bringing out the old - fashioned librarian to squeak and gibber for a season . ''

		This I was very careful not to do , knowing the sensitiveness of some librarians to the phrase , and also having repeatedly read the passage quoted again by the '' Transcript , '' regarding the curmudgeon of olden time who kept his books under rusty lock and key .

		My suggestion was a very simple one , growing out of an experienced need and from visits to a number of small libraries , in more than one of which untrained book-lovers were doing acceptable work .

		I do n't for a moment doubt that these same people would do better work if they were graduated from some good library school ; but , conditions being as they are -- and no one has charged tliat I misstated them -- the best graduates of the library schools very naturally accept positions where they have the minimum amount of merely me - chanical work to do .

		In many cases , then , this leaves the mechanical graduate -- who , of course , is not a product peculiar to library schools -- for the remaining positions .

		Many helps have already been furnished for the untrained , and my suggestion was that correct classifi - cation , the stumbling block for trained and untrained alike , should be furnished also from some competent source .

		Then the trustees of a small library would be enabled to employ a person fitted by tastes and culture for the position , whenever and wherever they could find him .

		It has seemed to some that such a person , aided by the technical helps available , would give better ser - vice than the poorer graduates of any school .

		I am glad to state that a publishing house closely identified with library interests has already announced that it will soon be prepared to furnish such classifica - tion as I suggested .

		MORE DEFINITIONS OF `` GAWMING '' OR '' GORMING . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		I have read with interest the communication of Mr.
Roswell Field	PERSON	in the issue of The Dial for
March 1	DATE	, with reference to the word '' gawming . ''

		I , too , recall that in my boyhood the word was in frequent use in
Connecticut	LOCATION	.

		The verb was commonly spelled '' gorm , '' and so far as I remember was used only in the sense of '' to smear and render sticky . ''

		In the
Century Dic	ORGANIZATION	- tionary both '' gorm '' and '' gawm '' are described as the same as '' gaum , '' to which are given distinct meanings .

		The first definition includes '' to care for ; heed ; observe ; to understand ; consider ; distinguish '' ; another definition is '' to smear as with anything sticky -LRB- perhaps a variation of gum -RRB- . ''

		Following this definition is the derivative meaning , `` to handle clumsily ; paw . ''

		The use of the word in all these senses is described as provincial En - glish .

		The
Standard Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	gives the like definitions with a similar attribution .

		It seems to me that the defi - nition quoted from
Colonel Higginson	PERSON	's article on '' The Migration of Words , '' -- '' awkward , lubberly , '' comes from the derivative meaning of the word '' gaum '' -- '' to handle clumsily . ''

		It also seems to me that the meaning of the expression '' gorming about , '' which Mr.
Field	PERSON	gives as '' looking about in a clownish and aimless manner , ' is a mistaken meaning ; that expression being apparently derived from one of the definitions of the word `` gaum , '' as first described , that is `` to observe . ''

		The unusual occurrence of the word must account , I suppose , for the evident confusion of meanings in its use this side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		THE DIAL 171 t E ^ to ISaoks .

		Dr.
John Brown	PERSON	and his Friends .

		* A volume of familiar letters from the author of ''
Rab	PERSON	and his Friends '' and ''
Marjorie Fleming	PERSON	'' is sure to be pleasant reading .

		In a goodly octavo , his son -LRB- who , of course , con - tinues the long line of
John Browns	PERSON	-RRB- and Dr.
D. W. Forrest	PERSON	have edited a generous selection of letters to and from Dr.
Brown	PERSON	, covering the half - century from
1830	DATE	to the physician-author 's death in
1882	DATE	.

		In the near view thus afforded of a tender and beautiful , rather than a brilliant and powerful , character the book is all that could have been expected , and nearly all that could be desired .

		Like all collections of letters , however , it naturally includes many paragraphs , not to say pages , dealing with little transitory matters of no interest in themselves , but gaining a significance from the reader 's love of the writer .

		The father , grandfather , and great-grand - father of Dr.
John Brown	PERSON	were all men of some mark , ministers of religion , at once saintly and shrewd -- canny
Scotchmen	PERSON	, in short , each a power in his parish , and even somewhat beyond -- and all bore the name
John	PERSON	, transmitted through how many previous generations we know not .

		Handicapped by such an apology for a name , ''
John Brown	PERSON	'' -LRB- it might almost as well have been a number -RRB- , these worthies were of necessity compelled to assert their individuality in some unmistakable manner , in order to avoid confusion with the hundreds of other contem - porary
John Browns	PERSON	.

		And in the case of our
John Brown	PERSON	, who knows but it may have been a fear of losing the sense of his separate identity that made him , serious and devout though he was , break with the tradition of his forefathers and choose medicine rather than the ministry for a calling ?

		This inherited strain of seriousness and piety reveals itself early , and somewhat amusingly , in a letter to the writer 's brother
William	PERSON	.

		From John , surgeon 's assistant at
Chatham	LOCATION	, twenty-one years old , goes the following fatherly advice to
William	PERSON	under the paternal roof in
Edinburgh	LOCATION	: '' And now , my dear
William	PERSON	, though I am 400 miles away from you , my thoughts are often with you , and they are sometimes anxious and sad , at others cheering and satisfying .

		My dear
William	LOCATION	, he assured that there is no real happiness where there is the indulgence iu guUt -- that pure thoughts and upright actions as assur - edly and as consequently cause real happiness as the sun * Letters of Dk .

		light and heat .

		Keep this always before you ; know the God of your fathers .

		Although I do not think I am really religious -- I fear I am not -- I can see from experience that the way of transgression is hard . '

		* Much more advice , equally excellent , follows and precedes this illustrative extract .

		The young writer 's reference to a personal experience of transgression is delightful , in its way .

		Not so pleasing , in fact almost shocking , is a curiously unfeeling account of a surgical operation a few months later .

		Anaesthetics were stiU in the fu - ture ; yet no word of pity for the patient passes from John to WiUiam . ''

		I took off a young man 's arm , '' he writes , '' on the morning the Dr. sailed .

		I found the operation ridiculously easy , and the whole of the stimip , with the exception of the comer where the ligatures hung out , healed prima intentione .

		Mr.
Dods	PERSON	and I have used the actual Cautery three times , and I hope with success . ''

		But in surgery , as in war , cutting and burning get to be matters of little moment -- the more 's the pity .

		More human and homely in its interest is the subjoined pas - sage from a letter to the paternal
John Brown	PERSON	: '' I am very desirous to see
Canterbury	ORGANIZATION	and
Dover	LOCATION	, and my present plan is to go down to
Canterbury	ORGANIZATION	by one of the night coaches -LRB- 6 / outside -RRB- so as to be there at 4 in the
morning	TIME	and in plenty of time to walk to
Dover	LOCATION	, distance 16 miles .

		After seeing it I shall walk to
Ramsgate	ORGANIZATION	and
Margate	LOCATION	, and take the coach from there to
Canterbury	LOCATION	, where I will remaui all night , and after spending the next day in seeing the
Cathedral	LOCATION	, etc. , return home to
Chatham	LOCATION	in the
evening	TIME	, but on this also I await your decision .

		If I were to return by the smack directly without being more than a day in
London	LOCATION	, # 5 would suffice , inclusive of the # 2 :2 / for the Tailor 's bill .

		I think I mentioned in my last that if I remained in
London	LOCATION	and called on any of my friends , I would require a new pair of trowsers .

		They will cost # 1 :7 / . ''

		Of such unheroic details are great and small alike compelled to take thought in this world of food and clothing and tailors ' bills .

		By way of contrast , let us quote a few sentences addressed to the writer 's lifelong friend .

		Dr.
John Taylor Brown	PERSON	.

		Worthy of note is the mention of the three-year-old '' bairn , '' from the hand that was afterward to write so touchingly of ''
Marjorie	PERSON	. '' ''

		I often envy your very miseries , the things that drive you inwards into the Far in , where , self-sufficient and self-contained , you may amid darkness -- where the light is as darkness -- sit i ' the centre and enjoy bright day .

		I am going out to
Callands	LOCATION	to-day for no other purpose of being all alone in the open air on the common road for 5 hours , and have a long and full-length think with myself .

		The other purpose is to see a haim of 3 years old , the daughter of my Uncle 's ploughman 's wife , a perfect image of sweet mildness .

		I wish you saw her with her long eyelashes and her unfathomable eyes , and her eerie black blink .

		If you did you would understand some of my love for her .

		I have wandered days with her among the hills , leading 172 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, her in my hand , and every now and then asking her to open wide her eyes that I might stare into their depth .

		She will kiss nobody in the world but her father , mother , brothers and sisters , and me ! ''

		Before passing to the later and , in a literary way , more important letters , it must be noted that even in his early professional experience at
Chatham	LOCATION	Dr.
John Brown	PERSON	attained some degree of fame .

		His unselfish spending of himself at the time of the cholera epidemic , in
1832	DATE	, was many years later referred to by
Dickens	PERSON	at a private dinner-party in
Edinburgh	LOCATION	.

		The nov - elist , as a footnote records the incident , '' told of the deep impression made on his mind by the conduct of a young Scottish doctor at
Chatham	LOCATION	during the cholera epidemic .

		He described his remaining with a poor woman whom all had deserted , ministering to her to the end , and then , overcome with fatigue , falling asleep , and being still asleep when in the morning the house was entered .

		One of the party exclaimed , ' That is Dr.
John Brown	PERSON	! ' ''

		In a letter to Lady
Minto	PERSON	, written in
1880	DATE	, are references to two renowned characters , one of whom was not then of so great renown as to make the recognition of his greatness a mere matter of course . ''

		I do n't wonder you like the Travels with a Donkey ; it is just what you say of it , true genius , a new liquor , fresh and aromatic ... He is son of
Thomas Stevenson	PERSON	, Civil Engineer , ' the Family Theologian , ' and grandson bf the grand old
Bell Rock	ORGANIZATION	man .

		He wrote in the Comhill some time ago the wisest and best words , since
Carlyle	PERSON	, on
Burns	PERSON	, on whom of late far too much has been written ; and he has a clever little book , An Inland Voyage in
France	LOCATION	in a Canoe , which he made with Sir
James Simpson	PERSON	's son
Walter	PERSON	; and he has a paper on the old Capital of
California	LOCATION	in this month 's

		... I met
Lowell	PERSON	when here -LSB- in
Edinburgh	LOCATION	-RSB- and like him greatly -- a ' full man , ' as well knowledged as Sir
Henry Taylor	PERSON	, but full also of original fun -- a great poet , I think .

		Do you know him and his works well ?

		I would much rather be him than
Tennyson	PERSON	or
Browning	PERSON	; there is more of the light of common day , more naturalness in thought and word , and no want of depth or tenderness , with humour of the strongest and rarest flavour .

		He told me he crossed the
Atlantic	LOCATION	with
Thackeray	PERSON	,
Clough	PERSON	, and
Lowe	PERSON	-- such a foursome !

		He talked a great deal about
Don Quixote	PERSON	, which I had just been slowly reading , and I was delighted to hear his praises .

		But he says it is dreadful to read him in English .

		He looks upon
Cervantes	PERSON	as on the same shelf with Homer ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and
Dante	PERSON	, primary and unapproachable . ''

		These letters form , and are meant by the edi - tors to form , an outline sketch of the writer 's life from his own pen .

		To supplement them there are added others addressed to him , out of the comparatively few still preserved .

		Most in - teresting are messages from
Ruskin	LOCATION	,
Thackeray	PERSON	,
Gladstone	LOCATION	,
Jowett	PERSON	,
Dean Stanlev	PERSON	,
R. H. Hutton	PERSON	, and
Mark Twain	PERSON	.

		The last-named appears to have been on the friendliest of terms with the chronicler of
Rab	PERSON	's little history , as was only natural .

		From
Elmira	LOCATION	he writes in the
summer of 1876	DATE	: '' Dear Friend the Doctor -- It was a perfect delight to see the well-known handwriting again !

		Readers of the '' Horae Subsecivae '' will re - member the chapter , in the third series , on the '' Death of Thackeray '' ; and to them it will be no surprise to find in this volume of the author 's correspondence evidence of the warmest friend - ship between the two men .

		The
Edinburgh	LOCATION	physician was among the first to recognize the novelist 's genius , and he took the lead in pur - chasing and sending to him , as a tribute from
Edinburgh	LOCATION	admirers , a handsome silver inkstand fashioned to represent '' Mr.

1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 173 The
Gkeat Master of Military Strategy	ORGANIZATION	.

		* In the first two volumes of
Colonel Dodge	ORGANIZATION	's
Napoleon	PERSON	-LRB- reviewed in The Dial of
September 1 , 1904	DATE	-RRB- , the campaigns from
1796	DATE	to
1807	DATE	were described ; the third and fourth voliunes are now before us , and carry us through to the closing scenes of the great drama .

		The years from
1808	DATE	to
1815	DATE	are the years of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's decline ; the dictator of European policies from the raft at Tilsit was now to find himself more slackly followed , then stubbornly opposed , then persistently forced back , then crushed .

		Colonel Dodge follows every move of the
Grand Army	ORGANIZATION	with keen but unbiased judgment ; he lays his finger on every faulty manoeuvre ; he finds in the waning vitality of the Emperor ample cause for the lapses in judgment and energy which a
Bonaparte	ORGANIZATION	would never have shown ; and when all is said and done he finds in Napoleon the greatest military genius of modern times .

		The general reader , who may be presumed to be acquainted with the outlines of the Napoleonic wars , will open these massive vol - umes with some shrinking of spirit ; but if he will summon his patience and resolution , a sure reward will come in the deep compelling interest of the events themselves and in what is possibly his first clear comprehension of the movements so clearly and minutely depicted .

		The true way to feel the dramatic force of a battle or a cam - paign is to understand it ; and this achievement is within the reach of those who will read with care these volumes .

		Colonel Dodge of course uses the technical terms of war ; but these are readily learned by the lay reader , and the author gives him every help with maps and plans .

		In this way , what was formerly vague geographical suggestion becomes-accurate topography , and the fury and glory and terror of it all are only in - tensified by the statistics and the precision .

		Volume III .

		begins with the indecisive Span - ish campaigns , of
1808	DATE	, in which
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's brother
Joseph	PERSON	and some of his generals showed what blunders they were capable of when away from the master 's eye .

		Then come the series of battles along the
Danube	LOCATION	, in which Wagram remains the most conspicuous .

		Over 300 pages are given to the invasion of
Russia	LOCATION	in
1812	DATE	; and no rhetoric is employed or needed to heighten the difficulties of the march to
Moscow	LOCATION	, or the horrors of that awful retreat .

		figures , as
Colonel Dodge	ORGANIZATION	marshals them with passionless veracity , are enough .


Moscow	LOCATION	and the
Beresina	PERSON	were the fourth act of the great tragedy ;
Leipzig	LOCATION	and
Waterloo	LOCATION	were the fifth .

		The account of these epoch-closing struggles occupies a large part of the concluding volume , and in it the author has put forth to the utmost his powers of profound investigation and lucid description .

		In regard to
Waterloo	LOCATION	, indeed , he would seem to have said the last word . ''

		From its actual course it seems certain that , had the battle of
Waterloo	LOCATION	been fought out between
Napoleon	PERSON	and
Wellington	LOCATION	, quite apart from expectation of aid or dread of interference by the Prussians , and judging by the many acknowledged weak spots in the British line of battle , it would , with the heavier masses and reserves properly put in by the master hand , have proved a French victory ...
Napoleon	PERSON	's gravest mistakes were in not mancEuvring when
Blucher	PERSON	was first seen , and later in not retiring out of action , and in putting in what remained of the Guard as he did , instead of using it to protect a retreat to the
Sambre	ORGANIZATION	.

		The fatal outcome was primarily attributable to
Napoleon	PERSON	's want of his old perspicacity .

		We can scarcely conceive him , in the days of AusterUtz or
Jena	PERSON	, drawing from the facts he knew an absolute conclusion that the Prussians could not reach his right ; but at
Waterloo	LOCATION	he did draw this wrong con - clusion , acted upon it , and failed .

		Had he correctly divined
Blucher	PERSON	's intentions he would by 1 or 2 a. m. have ordered in
Grouchy	LOCATION	, and he would not so long have put off his massed attack upon the English .

		The best work of the day was done by Lobau at
Planchenoit	LOCATION	, under the Emperor 's eye .

		The Prussians had been as good as their word , and deserve unstinted commenda - tion ; and as to
Wellington	LOCATION	, no praise is too high for his courage in accepting battle where he did , and for his tactical alertness , his skill in handling his men , and his dogged perseverance throughout the day .

		As always , the British troops fought as they should , and the officers exhibited every quality that goes to make up the best lieutenants . ''

		Along with this judgment must be read the author 's conclusion a few pages further on : `` All criticism of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's conduct of this cam - paign must be read in the spirit that prompts it , the utmost admiration of his genius , and a desire to inquire why he here failed , when previously , under as difficult conditions , he had won .

		After all is said , and despite his last four years ,
Napoleon	PERSON	remains the greatest soldier of modern times ; criticism of any kind must always result in evolving this conclusion ; and every word spoken of his laxness here is subject to the knowledge that no failure can rob him of his fame as the best leader and broadest teacher of war of the Christian era . ''

		This last phrase seems to exclude
Alexander	PERSON	,
Hannibal	LOCATION	, and
Caesar	PERSON	, the three ancient ones of
Colonel Dodge	ORGANIZATION	's six great captains ; and in this connection it is at least interesting to note his summary of his six heroes : '' No doubt , taking him in his many-sidedness ,
Caesar	PERSON	is the greatest character in history .

		It may not unfairly be claimed that
Napoleon	PERSON	follows next , especially in that he preserved for
Europe	LOCATION	many germs of the liberty 174 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, which was born of the blood of the Revolution .

		Csesax was the most useful man of antiquity ;
Napoleon	PERSON	comes near to being the most useful man of modern times .

		But neither
Caesar	PERSON	nor
Napoleon	PERSON	appeals to us as do splendid , open-hearted
Alexander	PERSON	, patient , intrepid , ever-constant Hannibal , the Christian hero
Gustavus	PERSON	, and daring , obstinate , royal
Frederick	PERSON	.

		Were we to classify these great captains , we might describe them thus :
Alexander	PERSON	, the first teacher of systematic war ;
Hannibal	LOCATION	, father of strategy ;
Caesar	PERSON	, the organizer ;
Gustavus Adolphus	PERSON	, father of modern war ;
Frederick	PERSON	, the battle tactician ;
Napoleon	PERSON	, the perfect strategist . ''

		So long as the war-drum must throb , it is well that such books should be written ; and it is matter for honest pride that from the small
Army	ORGANIZATION	list of the
United States	LOCATION	should come a man who could compose a series of perhaps the most ex - haustive military biographies of our time .

		The Rejuvenation or
Henry James	PERSON	.

		* Some people will feel when they see the `` New York Edition '' of Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	's novels and tales , as some others felt when the '' Outward Bound Edition '' of Kipling appeared .

		That was -LRB- as this is -RRB- a very handsome edition , and something wholly proper and what one likes .

		There was a pleasure in viewing , in thinking of , the stately volumes , even aside from the pleasure of reading such good print on such good paper .

		Yet there was then , as there will be now , a touch of regret that those old famUiar favorites are to be superseded , relegated to an upper shelf or a row behind those with the new uniforms , put away .

		They were of different sizes and ages , and from different publishers , those old volumes of James , and probably the set was not com - plete -- even an earnest Jamesian -LRB- shall we say ? -RRB-

		could acknowledge some gaps ; still the old vol - umes had charm , partly perhaps of association .

		But these are common woes , -- woes that one may happen to feel whenever a favorite contem - porary is elevated to the Olympus of a definitive edition .

		There is another thing in this case , a loss which doubtless Mr.
James	PERSON	feels , to parody
Shelley	PERSON	, but we alone deplore .

		In this case we are not to have the dear old things as we remem - ber them , or even as they were .

		They are to return to us brought up to date by the author .

		K you have ever seen one you loved twenty-five years ago you have perhaps regretted the changes made in the once familiar lines by five lustres .

Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		Here it is just the other way : we are now called to regret that once loved forms are rejuvenated .

		The friend of our youth has decided upon a golden wig .

		Mr.
James	PERSON	is translating his works into his own dialect .

		At first it was hoped by those of older time that there would be but slight change , -- that Mr.
James	PERSON	would run through a volume as he sat over a cigar after dinner , and pencil on the margin a change or so .

		But such is not the case : there is hardly a page where he has not made half a dozen alterations .

		Such a proceeding overshadows every other interest connected with the edition : one can not help it .

		Undoubtedly , at best or at worst , the revision is a minor matter .

		If we like it , it does not really change our net impression of the work ; if we do not like it , ten to one we shall hardly notice the difference unless we set ourselves down to collate .

		We must constantly say to ourselves , '' It is not important , '' -- but we can not help thinking of it and talking of it .

		Because , of course , the recent
James	PERSON	is so different from the
Henry James , Jr.	PERSON	, of our youth . ''

		So different , yes , and so much better ! ''

		cry the neo-Jamesians , the recent converts . ''

		Would you have stopped
Tennyson	PERSON	's revision and re-revision ? '' ''

		No , '' say the Irreconcileables , those who read '' The Portrait of a Lady '' with the fevers and pulses of youth , and strove unto death with somnolence over '' The Wings of a Dove . '' ''

		No , -LSB- say they -RSB- we would prevent no one else from doing as he may choose .

		We would stop one thing only , just this one , this unique person from doing this one unique thing . ''

		The thing is done , however , and done thoroughly ; and if the irre - concileable will not like it , the only thing to do is to shut oneself up with the older editions and forget the modern world , or else to confine one - seK to '' The Spoils of Poynton '' and such other thino : s as Mr.
James	PERSON	leaves outside the fold .

		The fact that the present edition gives us a revised text is really of something more than the sentimental interest alluded to .

		As he went on in life Mr.
James	PERSON	changed his ideas of material and his ideas of expression .

		His interests in life seemed to turn , not unnaturally , into directions neglected before , and which many of his ad - mirers would have themselves been contented still to neglect .

		His feeling for expression became more precise , more refijied , perhaps even more delicate .

		He became in some respects more modern , -- or more accurately he remained modern .

		But chiefly he strove to get closer to the texture , the movement , of his own thought , and to give his readers a more delicate sense of his conception than had been possible before .


1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 175 It was a fine ideal . ''

		Rien que la nuance ! ''

		says
Paul Verlaine	PERSON	, '' toute le reste est litterature . ''

		Mere literature Mr.
James	PERSON	's volumes would never have become , and yet we can not think him wrong for pursuing assiduously the fleeting good that mocked him with the view .

		Others have done the same thing , notably
Walter Pater	PERSON	: toward the end of his life those who had read '' The Renaissance '' with passion were at some pains to comprehend , even , '' Plato and
Plato	PERSON	- nism . ''

		Mr.
James	PERSON	also became crabbed when , perhaps , he meant to be clear , or at least exact .

		Thus it really is something of a question whether it was worth while to re - write his novels .

		There can be little doubt that Mr.
James	PERSON	wrote better English thirty years ago than he writes to-day .

		But he does not think so himself , and so he has done his best to put the old dears into modern dress .

		It is impossible without much study to say how he has succeeded .

		He has not succeeded entirely , it may be said . ''


Roderick Hudson	PERSON	'' and the others are fortunately not quite '' brought into alignment of style , color , and general liter - ary presentment '' with `` The Golden Bowl . ''

		Still they are changed .

		The changes are all -LRB- so far as my collations extend -RRB- in matters of word , phrase , and sentence ; chapters and paragraphs are as before .

		Such changes hardly affect larger matters : they change the general tone and they may change the impression of character .

		Thus
Christopher Newman	PERSON	seems an American gentleman who in the 70 's had had the advan - tage of reading Mr.
James	PERSON	's later writings .

		Asked if this is the first time he has been abroad , he used to say , '' Very much so '' ; now he says '' Quite immensely the first . ''

		Asked if he will not learn to talk French , he used to say only , '' Hang me if I should ever have thought of it '' ; now he adds , '' I seemed to feel it too far off . ''

		When Mile .

		Nioche tells him that her copy is bad he used to say , '' I like it all the same '' ; now he says , '' I never outgrew a mis - take but in my own time and in my own way . ''

		He once said '' I 'm not intellectual '' ; now he says '' I do n't come up to my own standard of culture . ''

		But I must leave this subject , fascinating though it is , because of its immensity .

		To tell what changes Mr.
James	PERSON	has made , even what sort of changes , if one teU at all accurately -LRB- and why at all otherwise ? -RRB-

		would be a great task .

		And to tell why he made them would be , if not a task at least or at most an achievement for a far finer divination than is here at the reader 's service .

		One must be satisfied with recom - mending it to the imiversity students of litera - ture as material for doctors ' dissertations .

		Let us leave such things , and turn to what is for the moment -LRB- if not for posterity -RRB- of more importance .

		The prefaces will be a delight to all Jamesians , even to many who modestly dis - claim such a title .

		To such a one these prefaces may be interesting chiefly as helping on toward one 's conception of the novel as a literary form , -- to put it in very academic language .

		Not quite so interesting , I should say , as '' a unique body of criticism of the art of the novelist '' -LRB- to quote the prospectus -RRB- , but rather a collection of facts which will help the student as a foundation for a science of fiction .

		Or to be more practical , they will serve the reader of James -- the new , fresh , unsophisticated reader of
James	LOCATION	, if there are any such , there surely will be , -- to see what the author is driving at , to see what in the novels was the author 's conception of the fine thing .

		Not that the author always knows , -- we are inclined to say , perhaps not , but then we may imagine that he has a keener , intenser feeling about it than we shall be likely to have .

		The author may be often wrong --
Dickens	PERSON	, we may remember , fancied himself so much on his plots and his pathos ; but then , so are we sometimes wrong .

		And often it is a good tonic to get an idea of something that we had not particularly noticed .

		So , then , these prefaces are interesting as showing us the novelist as he conceives his work .

		In ''
Roderick Hudson	PERSON	'' he speaks of the neces - sity of a full living development of his subject ; in `` The American `` of the conception first of the situation , and the subsequent entrance therein of the hero .

		In '' The Portrait of a Lady '' it was the figure of Isabel Archer who appeared first and gathered around her those who should enable her to do what she had to do .

		In '' The Princess Casamassima , '' the first impression was the life of a great city calling for apprecia - tion and the creation of an intelligence that should , after its fashion , appreciate it .

		Those are very interesting things , -- not unknown to students before , but still rather astonishing to the cut-and-dried student -LRB- if anything can astonish him -RRB- , the appearance of these three recognized modes of conception , if not of construction , in the work of the same artist in three consecutive works .

		Other things , too , -- the definition -LRB- if we may use so definite a word about anything that Mr.
James	PERSON	has written -RRB- of romanticism by this accomplished realist , the necessity of a chorus by this hardly classical modernist , these things will be noted and filed away by the 176 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, student , read and rolled under the tongue as a precious morsel by the Jamesian , grasped -LRB- we may at least hope -RRB- and put to the due use of cultivating the taste by the conscientious among general readers .

		Yet in addition to all these details there is one thing striking in these prefaces : namely , Mr.
James	PERSON	's sense of life .

		That certainly Mr.
James	PERSON	has , -- of his own kind , a skeptic may say .

		Mr.
James	PERSON	's world may seem to many a sequestered , perverted , exasperating world , and yet to him it evidently lives .

		He is not filling a regular literary form when he writes , or merely doing what the public will like .

		He has a sense of life , and he renders it .

		There is nothing mechanical in his composition , construction , architecture .

		The heroine of '' The Portrait of a Lady '' must have a world to live in , and somehow the people that are to make up that world gather about her , in a single night , so that the novelist wakes one morning and finds them all there .

		The hero of '' The Princess Casa - massima '' must contrast socialism with society , and there is
Christina Light	PERSON	, not settled and laid on the shelf , but living and insistent .

		There the creative imagination gets away from us .

		There in the feeling for vitality we have a man of genius , as well as an accomplished artist .

		Well , one can not say everything .

		Certainly one really ought to take this chance to say something ultimate about one of the preeminent figures of English literature ; but there has been so much else , that that slight matter must fall aside .

		Let us be content for the time with the information of the prospectus , that '' In the works of no other writer have American types of character and ideas appeared in such high relief and been characterized with such definite refer - ence to nationality . ''

		It Siu'ely is not worth saying anything after that .

		One thing may be remarked in closing .

		It was a very happy idea to illustrate each volume with '' portraits of some scene , situation , etc. , representative of the locality of the text , '' and the execution has admirably carried out the plan : the pictures are an immense addition to the novels .

		Such as are accustomed to impressions of the spirit of place will look long and with intense pleasure at the picture of the Faubourg Saint Germains in '' The American , '' -- it almost takes the place of the novel .

		People who feel that they have lost something in the modernistic text may feel that they have gained something here , and so almost with some of the others .

		The spirit of place , -- how much it may be in a novel !

		People skip long descriptions of scenery , doubtless , but there is a sense of place that is surely as fine , as satisfying , in a novel as a good situation or a good character .

		One had not , perhaps , thought of it before in Mr.
James	PERSON	's work , nor is it always there .

		But in some cases it is surely felt , as surely he felt it strongly himself .

		Not in
Northampton	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, or other such crudities ; Mr.
James	PERSON	, as he explains him - seK , has little sense of that sort of thing , -- but of great centres , of
Rome	LOCATION	, of
London	LOCATION	, of
Paris	LOCATION	, '' the splendid , the glorious , '' the sophisticated , the decadent , as they used to say themselves .

		Stjkveys of
American Philosopht	ORGANIZATION	.

		* The publication of two histories of
American Philosophy	ORGANIZATION	, one in French and one in English , is not merely interesting in itself but also as indicating an advancement in our intellectual life .

		We have reached a point in which our speculations on the obscure questions of being take hold on each other , and take hold on the kindred speculations of other nations and other times , in a fashion that makes them matters of general import .

		It comes to be understood that , no matter how much contempt may be expressed for metaphysics as contrasted with inquiries which relate more directly to our immediate welfare , any people whose thoughts are at all active will always be interested v ^ this form of speculation .

		A nation is very restricted in its mental effort that does not occasionally push its conjectures into th * unseen world .

		Once com - ing under this fascination of mind , it will never rest in contentment till it has built up about known facts a system of coherent assumptions which serve to expound and support them .

		If we deal diligently with the visible , it is sure to lead us to the invisible as in some way coherent with it .

		The first mentioned of these two histories ,
M. Beclaere	PERSON	's '' La Philosophic en Amerique , '' is a clear , succinct , timely treatment of the growth in American thought of philosophy as a solvent of the riddle of being , and helps us to understand how certainly these speculations have arisen , covered the ground , and are guiding us to a more harmonious sense of the nature of the life we are leading .

		New York :
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.


1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 177 our American pride .

		It gives attention to the educational and social influence of the various authors , as well as to the philosophical notions they have advocated .

		The other history referred to , that prepared by Dr.
I. Woodbridge Riley	PERSON	, is a much fuUer presentation , the result of extended inquiry , and seems to give us at once footing among the thoughtful nations of the world .

		As a history , it opens the way to much further labor , and leaves.ia this opening volume the impression of a large and not unfruitful field .

		A history of philosophy may lay stress on either part of its title ; it may be primarily historical or primarily philosophical , itself entering the field of inquiry and bringing criticism to its several products .

		Dr.
Riley	PERSON	's work imites the two tendencies , keep - ing neither exclusively in the foreground .

		What a history of philosophy in
America	LOCATION	chiefly calls for is a tracing of the steps by which this form of thought has progressed , and so preparing us to take a more intelligent and interested part in questions still arising .

		A criticism we are inclined to make on Dr.
Riley	PERSON	's first volume is its partial lack of a clear and succinct statement of the stages of discus - sion and of the persons taking part in them .

		It is not easy to give a brief effective presentation of any system of philosophy or of its advocates ; especially as the belief is often inadequate , and its disciples are confused and inconsistent in their allegiance .

		Something must be sacrificed to prominent features ; leading considerations must be strongly emphasized and qualifications passed more rapidly .

		The writer must photo - graph strongly ruling features , even if he fails to define perfectly intervening surfaces .

		Dr.
Riley	PERSON	seems to us to wander a little loo much at random through an author 's works , and , by mingling his own criticism , to help us still further to lose our way and to be left with a colorless impression of the force and order of events .

		Strong strokes should be given , even if the details of the picture seem somewhat neglected .

		So many mistakes are possible in philosophy , the darkness shuts in so quickly at so many points , we institute so many inquiries to which no answer can be given , our explanations are so often transient and insufficient , we so readily exaggerat -LRB- '' the fragment of truth we have secured , that it behooves us always to have a temper very tolerant of error , and to allow the little gold gained to be quietly added to our treasure .

		The faults of reason , finding its obscure way in a world whose clouds roll back upon us almost as soon as they are lifted , should be corrected with that patience which grows out of long continued and only partially successful effort .

		This pre - cept of quiet consideration , Mr.
Riley	PERSON	usually observes ; but his words occasionally show aver - sion or contempt .

		When
Clark	PERSON	, a small farmer , following in the steps of
Edwards	LOCATION	, ventures the conclusion , '' The question of foreordination to salvation or damnation , like raising a crop of wheat , is a question of using ordinary means , '' he is squelched by the remark , '' Here is Puritan - ism in bucolic trimmings ;
Edwards	LOCATION	, bound in half-calf . ''

		It may be doubted whether
Clark	PERSON	, short-sighted as he was , groped more painfully amid the facts of the world than did
Edwards	PERSON	.

		Dr.
Riley	PERSON	seems to us too anxious to trace historical connections , as those of
Edwards	PERSON	with some previous author .

		Forms of thought are not as strictly genetic as forms of life .

		Given general circumstances and current speculations , and any one person drops into them or opposes them under his own predilections .

		Personal tendencies are potent in the realm of mind .

		It is a waste of ingenuity to strive to trace them closely from person to person .

		Edwards 's dis - cussions grew out of his religious beliefs .

		Granted his sense of a mystical union with God , granted the omnipotence of God , and
Edwards	PERSON	's view of liberty follows naturally from his ruling convictions .

		What was peculiar to
Edwards	PERSON	was his unusual analytic power .

		By means of this , he heaped up about any topic a formidable argument .

		Assume the universal presence of causation , and nothing but logical coherence is called for to disprove the freedom of the human mind .

		Dr.
Riley	PERSON	's history is the more welcome because it comes to us with a far wider survey of the field than any which has gone before .

		We are no longer choked up by philosophy which has come to us as a by-product of science ; we cease to look upon philosophy as at best but the aftermath of a field whose chief harvest has been gathered in , and we are allowed once more to indulge ourselves in a wide survey of physical and spiritual facts and the one universe they together make up .

		We can not readily attach too much value to science , but we can easily , and often do , under-estimate the considerations which give chief interest to life , freighted as it is with the wealth of physical knowledge .

		No matter how skiKuUy we may fathom the sea , we must still draw our own breath from the heavens above us .

		178 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, The Ancient Apparition op THE Mongols .

		* A study of the Mongol race is of immense importance , not only for a proper understanding of European history and for the destruction of much worthless tradition and mythology based on our ethnic conceits , but also for right ideas in
this twentieth century	DATE	when the ends of the earth have met .

		Not only are the Mongols '' at our doors , '' but pretty nearly everybody is called a Mongol , or Mongolian , whose eye or whose tint of skin , as seen through the haze of our ignorance , is supposed to be of the race of
Genghis Khan	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Jeremiah Curtin	PERSON	's history of the Mongols is therefore valuable to the ordinary reader , and with its index and map will be a useful addition to the library .

		We may even hope that among the eighty or ninety millions of a people which has treaties with both
China	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	, but hardly a Japanese or Korean professorship in the whole nation , there will be many readers .

		Having read it , we can admire the patience and learning and the literary skill of the author ; for he has covered a vast deal of territory , and many of his passages are brilliant and show us the chief men of the great migrations and temporary kingdoms in such a way as to make them seem real personalities .

		Yet it must be said that the book is not so much a history as it is an unsifted collection of traditions and folk-lore .

		Mr.
Curtin	PERSON	may have possessed all the scholarship ascribed to him in such generous measure by President
Roosevelt	PERSON	, in the preface to the volume ; but we wish he had given his authori - ties , original and secondary , -- or , if not these , at least a chapter on the sources of his history .

		He might have revealed to us the labors of the mighty men of research who had gone before him over the ground both of the literature and the topography of the subject .

		Of
Howorth	PERSON	the compiler , or of Von Hammer the investigator , we hear nothing ; nor are there any notes or references to either chroniclers , ciitics , scholars , or narrators , Asiatic or European , who have told the Mongol story .

		It is an awful picture of murder and devas - tation which Mr.
Curtin	PERSON	has given us .

		No doubt the Mongols were vile and filthy , even butchers and devils of a certain sort .

		Yet when it comes to believing in the Mongol as a sort of diabolical superman , as the ugliest human being * Thb Mongols : A History .

		Little ,
Brown , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Jeremiah Curtin	PERSON	.

		Boston : on earth , and murderous beyond all comparison , we must decline to take our opinions from the mediaeval chroniclers or the tellers of folk-tales whom Mr.
Curtin	PERSON	seems to have so fully trusted .

		Such things can not take the place of the fruits of critical scholarship .

		Of course the popular fancy may be hit by descriptions of these '' squat , slit-eyed , brawny horsemen , with faces like the snouts of dogs , '' and the popular Oriental idea of the Mongol will continue to be that he emerged from
Tartarus	LOCATION	, and that we white men and '' heirs of all the ages '' have nothing to learn from the descendants of these men who are supposed to live in
China	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	, and still have an ambition to cover the whole earth .

		Nevertheless , we can not see how the Mongols differed very much from the Assyrians or the Romans , who destroyed nations , ploughed over sites of cities , and in other ways helped to give humanity its blood-baths .

		It is high time for some scholar to sift the records and evidence and give the sane and critical story of the Mongol invasion , treating of the Mongol origin , and settling once for all the dispute whether
Genghis Khan	PERSON	was or was not Yoshitsune the Japanese .

		Did the Mongols bring , from
China	LOCATION	into
Europe	LOCATION	, printing by means of movable types , and other things that were worth having ?

		To a large extent , the Mongols constituted the influences that , by resistance and absorption , became the making of
Russia	LOCATION	, even as in modem days the menace of
Russia	LOCATION	became so largely the incentive for the making of the new
Japan	LOCATION	.

		Furthermore , while the mediaevalists had the impression of snout-faced and squatty enemies , whom they in their superstitious fears correlated with the devil himself and with the fiends of hell , we must not forget that the Mongols may have had a no less favorable opinion of the Europeans .

		If some of us could , or would , read in Chinese books , and other '' Mongolian '' literary produc - tions , what the Asiatics think of us , our personal odor , the set of our eyes , the protrusion of our noses , the general offensiveness of our ways , and the manner in which reputed Christian soldiers and sailors have bombarded and massacred their people , we might attain a different view-point both of ourselves and of our enemies .

		By all means , let Mr.
Curtin	PERSON	's book be read ; it is interesting and fairly attractive in form .

		In its composition , Mr.
Curtin	PERSON	has followed the bent of his genius ; but it can not accurately be called a history .

		THE DIAL 179 Briefs on New Books .

		_ - * * It was inevitable that sooner or later J. lie civt of landscape such Standard works on landscape gardening .

		gardening as those of
Humphry Repton	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- 1752-1818 -RRB- should be given in modern form to a public that comprises laymen as well as professionals .

		Under the auspices of the
American Society of Landscape Architects	ORGANIZATION	, and edited by one of its members , Mr.
John Nolen	PERSON	, the
Riverside Press	ORGANIZATION	has now put forth a volume containing the two most important works of this notable pioneer in his field , under the title '' The Art of Landscape Gardening '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		These two works , '' Sketches and Hints on Landscape Garden - ing '' and `` Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening , '' have been so edited as to make them of practical usefulness to modern readers and stu - dents of the subject , without obliterating Repton 's frequent quaintness of expression , of which the following sentence , opening Chapter II .

		of the first - named work , may be given as an example : `` The perfection of landscape gardening depends on a concealment of those operations of art by which nature is embellished ; but where buildings are introduced , art declares herself openly , and should , therefore , be very careful , lest she have cause to blush at her interference . ''

		Repton 's high rank in his art is undeniable ; that he was appreciated in his own time is shown by the fact that over two hundred places , large and small , in various parts of
England	LOCATION	, remain as examples of his `` good taste , '' the quality that he exalts most highly .

		It is doubt - less true , as Mr.
Nolen	PERSON	points out , that a part of this contemj -RRB- orary appreciation arose from the for - tunate fact that Repton '' came at a time of signifi - cant development in his profession , '' which in turn was a part of the '' romantic '' movement .

		Yet a man of such native genius , with a real love of nature , the eye of an artist , a deep respect for utility , and a realization that a knowledge of many related arts and sciences was necessary for a true practice of his own profession , must have impressed himself on his times sooner or later .

		Mr.
Nolen	PERSON	conceives that , significant as was Repton 's professional work , his writings are `` his most permanent contribution to his art . ''

		They are founded upon his own observa - tions and practice , as recorded first in the '' Red Books '' devoted to each place that he laid out or improved .

		In his more formal writings he gave numerous extracts from these note-books , and alto - gether put in permanent form the principles of his art , which he derived by taking the best , as he says , from his predecessors , Le Notre and
Brown	PERSON	, and infusing these with his own genius .

		The scope of the two works under consideration is wide : '' Sketches and Hints '' -LRB- 1795 -RRB- treats of situations , buildings , water , large private places , formal gardening , approaches , the affinity between painting and gar - dening , and the sources of pleasure in landscape gardening ; '' Theory and Practice '' -LRB- 1803 -RRB- includes these subjects treated more in detail and more sci - entifically , and has chapters also on ancient and modern gardening , the relation between architecture and gardening , the formation of a new place , and considerations on color in landscape .

		Repton 's notes , together with some by the editor , are grouped at the back of the volume .

		The illustrations , includ - ing twenty-two full - page plates besides a frontispiece in color and numerous diagrams in the text , are especially worthy of mention , because , with the exception of a few modern photographs , they are reproductions of
Repton	ORGANIZATION	's own sketches , most of them in two sections , one superimposed on the other , -- the upper one showing a place in its original state , the other with improvements proposed or exe - cuted .

		The appearance of the book is in keeping with its character and with the assurance of excellence afforded by its imprint .

		A pernicious ^ travesty upon truth is ever more instance of dangerous than gross error .

		The ' near-science . ''

		lattgj .

		deceives only the culpably ignorant ; the former misleads the deserving though not discerning layman .

		In no field is such deviation more subtle and more pernicious than in that by right pertaining to the psychologist ; and if the distinc - tion must be awarded for the most flagrant violation of the scientific decalogue , the works of Dr.
John Duncan Quackenbos	PERSON	should be considered for the honor .

		The latest issue from this source , `` Hypnotic Therapeutics in Theory and Practice '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , is no worse than its predecessors , and brings hardly a novel aspect of what was sufficiently exploited in a former work .

		There is the same mingling of established doctrine with fancifully supported and crudely interpreted personal dogma ; the same exag - geration of what in modest proportion would be true enough ; the same appeal to the lovers of the occult and the intellectually asthenic .

		Mental therapeutics is a topic that looms large in the public interest .

		Residts are obtained by methods crude and drastic , '' bromidic '' or '' sulphitic , '' rational and the re - verse , -- the success being determined by the low or high personal equation of the patient .

		In the field where the wise do not altogether fear to tread , yet tread with caution , the bolder unwisdom rushes in and reaps -LRB- not wholly undeservedly -RRB- the reward of valor ; whereupon old theories are distorted and new ones crudely woven to give to practice the back - ground of consistent design .

		Whether the whole shall bear an intelligible and significant pattern , or be put together with the coherence of a crazy-quilt , depends wholly upon the mental quality of the per - former .

		For the product that takes something of the warp and woof of science and imitates accepted designs , but makes of the whole a plausible counter - feit , the term '' near-science '' is not wholly mal - apropos .

		Hypnotism is real enough ; so is mental therapy ; and so are the types of ailment and of relief treated in the several chapters of this book .

		But when accepted relations are stated -LRB- though these also misleadingly -RRB- on one page and wholly unwarranted deductions on the next -- both with 180 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, equal conviction -- the reader selects the more sen - sational and builds up a system of heaven and earth that is truly never dreamt of by a sound philosophy .

		This is reaUy '' yellow '' psychology , and is none the less jaundiced because one may charitably concede that the author is sincere .

		The pity of it is that more conservative and rational presentations of the psychological domain fall upon unwilling and impa - tient listeners , while these extravagant systems meet with vociferous applause .

		It is in no small measure because such obstacles beset his path that the psychol - ogist can not as successfully command his audience as he should , both for his own encouragement and the public good . ''

		Near-science '' looks much the same as the true article , but it will not stand the weather .

		Yet if appearance and the cut of the garment are alone cherished , the product is sure to be popular .

Montrose J. Moses	PERSON	's '' Chil - Abookabont ^ , g j ^ ^ ^ ^ Reading '' -LRB- New children 's books .

		, „ tt - i ?

		i York :
Mitchell Kennerley	PERSON	-RRB- we have one more addition to the abundant collection of books about books for children .

		While there is much in it that is sound , practical , and useful , we can not give it unqualified praise ; it is , as the author himself admits , an incomplete and unfinished sketch .

		Unlike the more comprehensive treatises on the historical , philosophical , cultural , and ethical aspects of children 's reading , Mr.
Moses	PERSON	gives snatches of these things , and of some others , -- all very inter - esting reading , but in no sense satisfying .

		One always feels that there is so much more that ought to have been said .

		The sketch of the development of literature for children from the Horn books to the days of
John Newbery	ORGANIZATION	and
Isaiah Thomas	PERSON	is neces - sarily sketchy and imperfect , but it is interesting and useful mainly on account of the Diagram-Chart intended to indicate partially `` The Growth of Juvenile Literature . ''

		In a section called `` The Old-fashioned Library '' the later eighteenth-century and early nineteenth-century writers for children are dealt with in somewhat fuller detail .

		But is not the attitude of mind which judges children 's books of the past from the present-day point of view an unscientific one ?

		In order properly to evaluate them we should consider them with reference to the conditions in which the children then lived , not with reference to the suitability of books of past times to the needs of the children of to-day .

		The further history of books for children in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	is traced in the section `` ConcerningThenandNow , '' which is somewhat poor and thin .

		For example , there is no reference to
Reinecke Fuchs	PERSON	-LRB- '' Reynard the Fox '' -RRB- , so popular in
England	LOCATION	and all over
Europe	LOCATION	; and the very beautiful epoch-making series of books for children projected and edited by Sir
Henry Cole	PERSON	, of
South Kensington	LOCATION	fame , and
W. J. Thoms	PERSON	the librarian of the
House of Lords	ORGANIZATION	, and published by
Joseph Cundall	PERSON	in
England	LOCATION	a little before the middle of the
last century	DATE	, is not honored with a line !

		From the point of view of selecting , editing , illustrating , and the practical details of type and printing , as well as the literary qualities which should enter into the making of books for children , this series has not since been surpassed ; and in no survey of the history of books for children should it be overlooked .

		The section devoted to '' The Library and the Book '' and '' The School and the Home , '' as well as the book-lists in the appendices , have practical value ; these chapters are mainly the result of collaboration by experts , whose '' wide experience , intimate contact with and knowledge of the books considered , and desire to show a human respect for the tastes of children '' entitle them to the highest consideration .

		There are many slips , errors , and omissions , sadly needing correction , which we have not space to indicate here ; and surely Mr.
Moses	PERSON	should have known better than to send out such a book without an index .

		The Duchesse ^ ^ would be impossible to find an de Lonc/uevilie apter designation for
Anne	PERSON	, Duchesse and her times .

		^ g LongueviUe , than the one that Mr.
H. Noel Williams	PERSON	has chosen as the title of his recently published study of the Duchesse and her times , -- `` A Princess of Intrigue '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		Born of a race of royal intriguers , thrust from a convent into the artificial atmosphere of the
Hotel de Rambouillet	ORGANIZATION	and the gaiety of a corrupt court , where her wit and beauty carried everything before them , married to a man twice her age , who cared nothing for her but was wax in her hands for any mapcap political adventure , she found herself , at twenty-five , an object of universal homage and a power to be reckoned with in the state of
France	LOCATION	.

		Naturally her ambition responded to the spur of opportunity .

		As fond of power as other gi-eat Frenchwomen have been , she seems to have been much less emotional .

		Lovers , save one , she scorned , valuing personal admiration only because it could be converted into partisanship .

		And yet in the ultimate crisis her love for La Rochefoucauld -LRB- of the '' Maximes '' and the prematurely published '' M ^ moires '' -RRB- triumphed over her loyalty to the house of Cond ^ ; she joined herself and her following to the opposition party , and the wars of the Fronde followed .

		This is the story that Mr.
Williams	PERSON	repeats , drawing for his details upon all available sources , both contemporary and modern .

		His work is issued in two handsome volumes , with many portraits of the Duchesse and her friends and enemies by way of illustration .

		Compared with some of his previous studies of great Frenchwomen this one lacks vivacity ; the figure of Mme.
Longueville	PERSON	hardly dominates the complicated picture of the events through which she moved .

		In part at least , this is due to the fact that , stripped of her beauty and her semi-royal standing , she would scarcely have been of commanding calibre .

		Yet some new facts , as announced in his preface , have been unearthed , especially concerning the production of
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	's plays , his relations with
Lyttelton	LOCATION	, and the tenure of his successive posts under the govern - ment .

		More important and interesting , however , than these small matters of detail in a rather une - ventful life are the author 's contributions , in the way of appreciative comment , toward a better under - standing of
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	as a poet of nature , and a more accurate determination of his influence on the poetry of his century , not only in
England	LOCATION	but also in
France	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	. ''

		Poetical ' nature-study ' in the modern sense of the term , '' the writer goes so far as to maintain , '' had its origin , paradoxical as the assertion may seem , in
the first half of the eighteenth century	DATE	; for it was then for the first time that the phenomena of external nature came to be regarded as objects of poetry in and for themselves . ''

		To say this of any poet or poets born and bred in the atmosphere of artificiality and turgid formality that to us seem so characteristic of eighteenth - century literature , is to say a good deal .

		To get back to nature one would hardly betake himself to the
England	LOCATION	of
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	's time .

		But , at any rate , Mr.
Macaulay	PERSON	's discussion of the matter is interesting ; and the book throughout is suggestive and stimu - lating .

		The treatment of '' The Castle of Indolence '' and the minor poems is as scholarly as that of '' The Seasons . ''

		As a careful study of a not superla - tively prepossessing theme , the little volume deserves nothing but praise .

		To one not versed in the intricacies of early and later Spanish intrigues , the long story of plot and counter-plot , of rebellion and treachery , of massacre and graft , is neither pleasing nor interesting reading ; though it is conceivable that the Chili of to-day is best inter preted in the light -- or , rather , the darkness -- of her past .

		The author is not in sympathy with American pretensions in that quarter , and stoutly denies that the
United States	LOCATION	lent any assistance to Chili in its struggles for liberty --
Hancock	PERSON	to the contrary notwithstanding , -- and blithely dismisses the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	as a cause for mirth among South American republics .

		Chili has an aristocracy whose Castilian lineage is a ground for hauteur and exclusiveness , and for the aristocratical form of so-called popular government which prevails .

		Her industry and commerce are in the hands of the English and Germans , who quickly become loyal ChUeilos .

		No country of the world has so valuable a working class as the Chilian inquilino , disciplined by centuries of oppression and toil , but still suffi - ciently inspirited to make a splendid soldier .

Krusi	PERSON	who attained something more than local fame as the disciple and associate of
Pestalozzi	LOCATION	, the younger
Hermann	PERSON	followed naturally and willingly in his father 's footsteps as a Pestaiozzian teacher and educational reformer .


Switzerland	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	, and
America	LOCATION	were successively the scenes of his labors , but the institution with which he was finally and permanently identified was the
Oswego State Normal and Training School	ORGANIZATION	, where he taught the philosophy of education , and also geometry and modern languages , for twenty-five years .

		He re - signed his post in
1887	DATE	, and died in
1903	DATE	, leaving behind him an autobiography , relating chiefly his rich and varied experience as an educator , and also a more detailed and personal record in the form of a diary .

		From these abundant sources has been compiled a full and readable account of a man of pronounced character , high ideals , and remarkable ■ energy ; and from his lectures and unpublished writings a few characteristic selections have been added .

		He was associated , first and last , with many prominent educators -- notably
Agassiz	PERSON	and
Guyot	PERSON	, his compatriots , -- and his life-story was well worth the telling .

		An error that has rather strangely escaped the editor 's vigilance is a reference to '' Williamsburgh '' as one of the attractive resorts of the
Berkshire hUls	PERSON	, where
Williamstown	LOCATION	, the seat of
Williams College	ORGANIZATION	, must have been meant .

		Good illustrations , and facsimiles of letters from Long - fellow and
Agassiz	ORGANIZATION	, accompany the text .

		^ ^ ^ The latest number in
Holt	PERSON	's '' Amer - Fish-bookfor ican Nature Series '' is President common use .


Jordan	PERSON	's work on Fishes , a large vol - ume of nearly eight hundred pages , with abundant text illustrations and eighteen plates in colors , in - cluding a beautiful plate of the famous golden trout of
Volcano Creek	ORGANIZATION	in the high
Sierras	LOCATION	.

		This work is in the main , but not whoUy , a selection from the author 's two-volume '' Guide to the Study of Fishes '' published several years ago .

		It contains most of the non-technical matter of that more extensive work , and is therefore of more interest and value to the general reader , the nature-student , or the angler , than the larger work .

		It is substantially a general natural history of fishes , treated from the standpoint of popular interest , but upon comprehensive lines .

		182 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	,
Naturally	ORGANIZATION	, fishes of importance as food , or sought for hy anglers , are given a prominent place in the pages of this hook ; hut one also finds that Dr.
Jordan	PERSON	is even more alert to seize upon any item of interest or significance regarding the less known representatives of the finny world .

		The author 's wide knowledge of this group of animals , his com - prehensive selection of interesting data , his terse , lucid , often humorous presentation of his subject , and the superb selection of illustrations , all combine to make this by far the most readable and interesting popular natural history of fishes which has as yet been published .

		Letters of - ^ selection , in excellent English ren - o German dering , from
Schumann	LOCATION	's best and composer .

		liveliest letters is not a volume to be lightly dismissed by the reviewer .

		In '' The Letters of
Robert Schumann	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , as selected and edited by Dr.
Karl Storck	PERSON	and translated by Miss
Hannah Bryant	PERSON	, we have , in reasonably small com - pass , a very winning presentation of the composer 's artistic , sentimental , and romantic ideals and enthu - siasms .

		The earlier letters , from
Leipzig	LOCATION	and
Heidelberg	LOCATION	, mostly to his mother at home in
Zwickau	LOCATION	, are full of the emotions and aspirations and amiable conceits of a gifted and imaginative youth ; the letters to his sweetheart and future wife ,
Clara Wieck	PERSON	, are tender and devoted ; and those to his musical friends illustrate his progress and his tastes in his chosen calling .

		Schumann matured early , but there is an amusing mannishness about some of his student letters , as in this extract from a
Heidelberg	LOCATION	• letter to his mother , the writer being but nineteen years old : '' I think it is a pity for a young man to come to a town where the student holds undisputed sway .

		A young man of any grit develops best under a system of repression , and this perpetual loimging with no one but students limits his mental outlook , and injures him incalculably for practical life ... Fortunately I am sufficiently sobered to value things at their proper worth .

		I should certainly let any son of mine study one year at
Heidelberg	LOCATION	and three at
Leipzig	LOCATION	. ''

		A not too pronounced flavor of the sinnreich , the gefuhZvoll , the schwarmerisch even , pervades the letters , in a pleasant way , and gives them an undeniable charm .

		A portrait of
Schumann	PERSON	and one of
Clara Wieck	ORGANIZATION	are provided .

		„ Mr.
Frederick V. Holman	PERSON	's sketch
McLoughlin	PERSON	p t-v t i tut r i !

		• and the story of Dr.
John McLoughlin	PERSON	is a eu -
0	DATE	/
Oregon	LOCATION	.

		logy prepared in celebration of ''
McLoughlin	PERSON	day '' at the
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	Expo - sition in
1905	DATE	.

		Proving too lengthy for the occa - sion , it was condensed for oral delivery , and has since been printed in full by the
Arthur H. Clark	PERSON	Company of
Cleveland	LOCATION	.

		Although `` largely re - written '' according to the introduction , the address apparently retains in the main its original form .

		It consists of two parts : an accumlation of testimony to the effect that the Americans could not have maintained themselves in
Oregon	LOCATION	without the assist - ance of Dr.
McLoughlin	PERSON	, and the story of the conspiracy that robbed Dr.
McLoughlin	PERSON	of his land-claim at
Oregon City	ORGANIZATION	from its inception to the return of the claim to Dr.
McLoughlin	PERSON	's heirs , by the
State Legislature	ORGANIZATION	, five years after his death .

		The address is written in an entertaining style and with a full knowledge of local conditions ; but it is to be regretted that Mr.
Holman	PERSON	did not put together all the obtainable data regarding
McLoughlin	PERSON	in a more formal biography .

		About a third of the volume consists of illustrative documents , and two interesting portraits are given .

		BRIEFER MENTION . ''

		A
Collection of Eighteenth Century Verse	ORGANIZATION	, '' edited by Miss
Margaret Lynn	PERSON	, is published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		All the leading poets of the century are repre - sented , and
Dryden	PERSON	is thrown in for good measure .

		A group of Scotch songs and ballads fills a small but important niche in this volume .

		There are about four hundred pages of poems , and seventy-five of notes . ''

		The Poets :
Geoffrey Chaucer	PERSON	to
Alfred Tennyson	PERSON	'' is the title of a work in two volumes published by Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	The author is Mr.
William Stebbins	PERSON	, and his task has been to set down his '' impressions '' of about seventy poets -LRB- including four Americans -RRB- , inter - spersing the statement of his ideas with copious extracts .

		It makes a pleasant book to read , for it is the work of an ardent lover of poetry , but it is too personal an expression to have any marked critical value .

		The vein which
Longfellow	PERSON	worked so satisfactorily in his '' Poets and Places '' has suffered neglect from later editors , but there have been several recent signs of a revival of this species of anthology-making .

		Mr.
Robert Haven Schauffler	PERSON	, for example , now publishes , through Messrs.
Moffat	PERSON	,
Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, a volume called '' Through
Italy	LOCATION	with the Poets , '' which exhibits good judgment in its choice of poems , and makes a collection which every lover of
Italy	LOCATION	-LRB- and who is not one ? -RRB-

		must prize .

		It will be particularly valued for bringing together many beautiful pieces of very recent compo - sition , and for the classified arrangement which makes it useful for specific reference .

		It is difficult to understand the raison d'etre of the book of '' English Quotations '' prepared by Mr.
Robinson Smith	PERSON	, and now published by
Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is described as '' a collection of the more memor - able passages and poems of English literature , arranged accordmg to authors chronologically , '' and is provided with a verbal index .

		The words '' passages and poems '' in this description indicate the uncertainty of the com - piler 's aim .

		Long poems , such as Gray 's '' Elegy '' and
Wordsworth	PERSON	's '' ImmortaUty '' are given complete , or nearly so , but hundreds of other poems equally important are represented by short passages , or ignored altogether .

		On the other hand , the short quotations are taken rather at random , and the most familiar lines are likely to be looked for in vain .

		Consequently , we can not call the book either a good anthology or a good reference manual of familiar quotations .

		The editor 's sense of proportion may be illustrated by saying that he gives us forty pages of
Wordsworth	PERSON	and fourteen hnes of Byron .

		The poe - try selected is good , as far as it goes , but the selection seems to be representative of one man 's taste , instead of illustrating the consensus of received critical opinion .

Henry Loomis Nelson	PERSON	, formerly editor of ''

David A. Wells	PERSON	professor of political science at

February 29	DATE	at the home of his daughter in

		Announcements of
Spring Books	ORGANIZATION	.

		Our annual list of books announced for
Spring	DATE	publication , herewith presented , contains some eight hundred titles -- • practically the same number as in the corresponding list of
last year	DATE	, -- and offers convincing evidence that the publishing trade has not been seriously affected by the recent business depression .

		All the books here listed are presumably new books -- new editions not being included unless having new form or matter .

		The omission of any prominent publishers from the present list is due solely to the fact that such pub - lishers failed to respond to our repeated requests for data regarding their Spring books .

		If they can yet be induced to divulge the required information , the announcements of these houses will appear in our next issue .

		THIS series of volumes aims to present a comprehensive account of English liter - ature according to a new plan .

		Instead of the usual division of the field into chronological periods , a division according to types has been adopted , thus securing for the first time a unity in the treatment of the rise and development of all the important literary forms in English .

		Many neglected aspects of literary history will receive attention , and many new starting points for criticism and research will be suggested .

		Each volume has been intrusted to an acknow - ledged specialist in the particular field . ''

		Its judicious plan is to g ^ ve a volume or more to each clearly defined literary genre , instead of assigning , as has been the practice in many large works of the kind , a ' period ' to each writer .

		Both methods have their ad - vantages and their disadvantages ; almost any great collection of facts can be classified in various ways for different purposes .

		Certainly the development of a particular literary type can be studied more satisfactorily by isolating it from irrelevant facts , and the full story of the literary activity of a century is confusing , no matter how clearly it is presented . ''

		Type and not chronology is made the basis of classifica - tion .

		Periods are subordinated to structural form , each monograph by an authority on his assigned subject being limited to the character - istics , tendencies , and influence of a single formal type , and in gathering within the com - pass of a single well-digested and carefully developed volume of all the details , biograph - ical , bibliographical , historical , and critical , of the literary form under consideration .

		At that time
Shelley	PERSON	was only about nineteen years of age , but during the period covered by the letters many of the most important events of his life took place .

		In fact , his life during these months was full of romantic incidents which were to leave their mark for good or evil on the whole of his future career .

		The letters are written in a strain of the most candid and unreserved self-revelation .

		They exhibit in the liveliest colors the character of this rash , chivalrous , frank , and generous youthful poet .

		BRIEFER MENTION 216 NOTES 217 MORE ANNOUNCEMENTS OF SPRING BOOKS 218 TOPICS IN LEADING PERIODICALS 219 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 220 A PRAGM
ATIC	ORGANIZATION	SANCTION .

		The first attempt to produce a newspaper in
America	LOCATION	was made in
Boston	LOCATION	, on the twenty-fifth of
September , 1690	DATE	.

		The sheet was entitled '' Publick Occurrences , '' and was suppressed by the authorities after the appearance of the first issue .

		Only one copy of that single issue is now known to be in existence , and is preserved in the
Public Record Office	ORGANIZATION	in
London	LOCATION	.

		The aims of the venture were succinctly set forth , and among them we find the following : '' That something may be done towards the Curing , or at least the Charming of that
Spirit of Lying	ORGANIZATION	, which prevails among us , wherefore nothing shall be entered , but what we have reason to believe is true repairing to the best fountains for our Information .

		And when there appears any material mistake in anything that is collected , it shall be corrected in the next . ''

		These words show with what good intentions the incipiency of American journalism was marked ; that it was also deliberate in another sense appears from the fact that the paper was to be published only once a month , unless some '' Glut of Occur - rences '' should necessitate a more frequent appearance .

		It is not probable that the pro- jectors of this sheet were familiar with Shake - speare , but if they had been , they might have supported their accusation of mendacity by a text from Falstaff -- '' Lord , how this world is given to lying ! ''

		But they could hardly have anticipated the extent to which lying as a fine art was destined to be encouraged by the very agency which they were engaged in bringing into activity -LRB- as they fondly supposed -RRB- for its suppression .

		We have gone far since the days when the guileless fisherman of
Massachusetts Bay	LOCATION	freed the genie of journalism from its leaden casket .

		The newspaper is no longer a furtive experi - ment , but an established institution , provided with traditions , with set rules , and with fimda - mental dogmas .

		These attributes are the out - come of its long and active existence , and have slowly taken shape under the pressure of cir - cumstances .

		The policy of journalism is as definite a thing as the policy of diplomacy , or of monarchy , or of ecclesiasticism .

		It is bound at aU costs to maintain the efficiency of the 200 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, institution , and holds itself exempt from con - siderations that would be binding upon the individual conscience .

		Just as a king , or an ambassador , or a bishop will commit himself in his institutional or representative character to a course of action which would be impossible to a morally-minded individual , so an editor will do many things which would be abhorrent to him as a man conscious only of his personal relation to his fellows .

		In his private intercourse , he may be the soul of truthfulness , but when he dons his robes the truth is no longer in him ; he becomes the partisan of a policy , and is prepared in its interests to resort to the suppressio veri and the suggestio falsi ^ and to aid his cause by downright falsehood as far as the employment of falsehood seems reasonably safe .

		The sacred word of the editorial calling , as of the other callings we have grouped in the same category , is '' prestige , '' and nothing short of the danger of an impaired prestige will keep the representative of either of these callings near the line of scrupulous conduct .

		The prestige of the
State	ORGANIZATION	must be preserved , even at the cost of immoral treaties and unrighteous wars ; the prestige of the Church must be maintained , even at the cost of suppressing free inquiry and condoning obvious guQt ; the prestige of the newspaper must be guarded , even at the cost of betraying the public and defeating the ends of justice .

		Professor
Munroe Smith	PERSON	, in a recent issue of the `` North American Re - view , '' has developed this thesis as regards journalism in a highly interesting manner , and has ingeniously shown that `` the doctrine of journalistic inerrancy '' is fundamentally necessary for the support of newspaper pres - tige , just as the doctrine of predestination is the necessary foundation for the logical structure of Calvinism , and just as the doctrine of divine right is the necessary bulwark of monarchical absolutism .

		The word `` prestige , '' as our writer points out , has a dubious history , admirably fitting it for its modem use as the shibboleth of news - paperdom .

		In the eighteenth century , `` pres - tiges '' were defined by our great lexicographer as '' illusions , impostures , juggling tricks , '' and we still use the word '' prestidigitator '' in the sense of that old meaning .

		If to-day prestige has come to have something of the connotation of reputation , it still suggests its shady past , is acquired rather by smartness than by sincerity , and '' implies nothing more than successful Taking as his appeal to the imagination . ''

		starting-point the axiom that a newspaper must preserve its prestige , '' and his cue from '' The Prince , '' Mr.
Smith	PERSON	proceeds , by the use of the Machiavellian method , and with much of the subtlety of argument displayed by the
Floren	PERSON	- tine philosopher , to establish his contention in behalf of journalistic inerrancy .

		The editor , no less than the absolute prince , must follow the rules of his particular game , and prove himself quite superior to all considerations of bourgeois morality .

		He is no seeker after truth , but a purveyor of notions that are good enough for day-by-day consumption .

		Any other conception of his function wovdd speedily relegate him to the ranks of academics and idealists .

		If he were to become a victim of the delusion that '' news '' and '' facts '' had any definite relation - ship , he would probably have to be placed under restraint .

		Why , '' a serious and persistent pur - suit of facts would carry the journalist into the field of the historian , '' and where would then be his prestige ?

		Our author 's grave and mordant satire may be illustrated by the following paragraph : '' Journalists of the highest mental type develop a philosophy which is by no means unknown outside of their profession .

		They hold that truth is not ascertainable , and that , if it could be ascertained , it would probably be valueless .

		Applied to journalistic problems this theory produces very convenient inferences .

		Since the facts which constitute an occurrence can never be fully ascertained , one view of the occurrence is presumably as good as another .

		The first impression may be modified by a second , but the second in turn may be modified by a third ; and in many cases , after long investigation , the first impression is reestablished .

		As for edi - torial opinions , they are probably sounder and assuredly not less sound than other opinions .

		The only value of opinions , in any case , is the influence which they exercise upon conduct ; and if an editorial opinion makes for desirable conduct , it is better than a more deliberate judgment which may have undesirable results .

		It follows that there is really no reason why any plausible statement should be corrected or any laudable opinion modified . ''

		It will be seen at once that the philosophy of inerrant journalism , thus expoimded , is nothing more than a special case of pragmatism , and is thus brought into line with the ripest wisdom of our eminently philosophical age .

		The journalist may well say to the pragmatist , in
Juliet	LOCATION	's words , '' Thou hast comforted me marvellous much . ''

		But however industriously journalism may
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 201 lay this flattering unction to its soul , there is still a fly in the ointment .

		That bete noire is the letter to the editor .

		It may be sent at the most inopportune moment ; it is always irritating '' ; and , what makes the matter worse , it has a certain traditional claim to consider - ation .

		Evidently , the fellow who is ill-advised enough to write it must get short shrift , and upon this point our philosopher is emphatic .

		Every such petition for justice '' must be so answered that the petitioner shaU not be likely to repeat his offence . ''

		He must not be given any real satisfaction , for that would encourage him to write again , and would also stimulate other aggrieved persons to write on other sub - jects .

		Fortunately , the editor has many effec - tive ways of rebuking this form of impudence , and ways which may be skilfully masked under the pretence of fairness .

		He can set the letter in small type , for example , and tuck it into some out-of-the-way comer .

		Or he can put it in a conspicuous position , give it a heavy face heading which will darken its counsel in more than the literal sense , and foUow it by a large type reply as scornful and crushing as may be necessary .

		By these easy devices , the editor of parts may strengthen the popular belief in his omniscience , and establish the doctrine of journalistic inerrancy upon an unshakable foundation .

		There is only one real danger , which is that the doctrine may harden into a dogma , and the editor himself become its victim .

		That way lies disaster , for the consistent practi - cal maintainance of the doctrine requires a clear head , and the clear-headed editor must know all the time that his doctrine is a fiction , and its assertion a matter of policy only .

		Mr.
Smith	PERSON	plainly recognizes the danger here involved , and his last and most solemn words are devoted to warning editors against it .

		The rational journalist will , he thinks , confess to an error now and then , provided it concern some purely trivial matter , for the very purpose of strengthening the public faith in his substan - tial inerrancy .

		He may even go so far as to dismiss somewhat ostentatiously the reporter who is made to shoulder the mistake . ''

		An annual dismissal or a triennial retractation , if properly staged , would cause the murmurs of discontented thousands to pass unheeded . ''

		By displaying the wisdom of the serpent , `` the truthfulness and justice of his paper would so securely be established that subsequent vigor - ous adherence to normal journalistic policy would not seriously impair this new prestige for many years . ''

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		As OUTBURST OF GERMAN IMAGINAXrVE GENIUS IS soon to be witnessed , according to the glad expectation of that enthusiastic apostle of Teutonic culture , Professor
Kimo Francke	PERSON	.

		In an article on '' The New Spirit in Grerman Painting , '' with which the
April	DATE	`` Cosmopolitan '' opens , after vigorously disputing the prevalent notion that '' the
Germany	LOCATION	of to-day is given over , body and soul , to industrialism and militarism , that the land of the poets and thinkers has converted itself into a country of money-makers , '' he maintains that '' it would be easy to show how erroneous this widespread notion is ; how deeply astir contemporary
Germany	LOCATION	is with literary and artistic aspiration ; how the spirit of romanticism -- the same spirit which , at the beginning of the nineteenth century , led to such works as '
Faust	PERSON	' and the ' Ninth Symphony ' -- is striding again through the land ; how there has arisen a new , thoroughly modern , and in - tensely alive German drama ; how monumental German culture has developed a decidedly original and striking national style ; and how the time seems to be drawing near for another great outburst of German imaginative genius . ''

		This tip-toe attitude of eager expectancy , so characteristic of a century 's opening , is a subject for curious study .

		Confident expectation is undoubtedly one of the factors tending to bring about reaUzation , as our psychology makes us believe .

		How different , then , might have been the history of the world if man had been created with six fingers instead of five on each hand , and had adopted the duodecimal instead of the decimal system of notation !

		His natural longing and looking for new and better things with which to begin the record of each fresh and untried century would in that case have come every one hundred and forty-four years instead of every hundred , and we might not now be all alert , with the '' New Thoughters , '' for marvellous and unimagined spiritual developments , or straining eyes and ears , with the star-gazers , for some visible or audible message from Mars , or indulging in Utopian dreams of a graftless republic where railroad manipu - lators cease from troubling and toil-worn muck-rakers are at rest .

		... Pullman-car fiction , each story good for one hundred miles of entertainment , is soon to be on sale at every important railway news-stand in the land -- or in the world ; for that energetic originator and organizer of new enterprises , Mr.
Seymour Eaton	PERSON	-LRB- of '' Book - lovers ' , '' `` Tabard Inn , '' and `` Teddy Bear '' fame -RRB- , has taken the matter in hand and is going to astonish and delight the reading public with something new and irre - sistibly attractive .

		He is the founder and president of '' The Thinkers ' Club , '' described in its prospectus as `` a sort of clearing house for the thinkers of the world , '' and with him are said to be associated Mr.
Jidian Hawthorne	PERSON	as vice-president , Mr.
Harold Bolce	PERSON	as secretary , and Mr.
Edwin Liebfreed	PERSON	as treasurer .

		Just what kind of thoughts the Thinkers are going to think , one can only conjecture ; but as the association is apparently formed for book-publishing purposes , it will probably need some pretty busy thinking , and some equally energetic doing , in these times , to make the biisiness succeed .

		The books to be published will '' fill the gap between the condensed magazine article and the exhaustive and expensive book , '' and will be of a uni - form size and price , -- between eight thousand and twelve thousand words in length , and sold at twenty - 202 THE DIAL -LSB- AprU 1 ,
five cents	MONEY	each .

		In addition to new works by well-known writers , there will also be issued -LRB- less wisely , we must think -RRB- abridged editions of some of the standard works of literature .

		It is expected that by the first of
May	DATE	the initial publications of the club will be out , and that they will be of a serious character , some of them by men who '' have been known up to the present time as great captains of industry rather than as great writers . ''

		The
Pullman-Car Fiction	ORGANIZATION	is to follow a little later .

		• • `` A LIBRARY SIGN OF THE SEASON is now discernible . ''

		The members of the senior class , '' runs a library school news item , `` are spending the month in field work among the larger public libraries of the state . ''

		With note-book and pencil in hand , these sharp-eyed young persons , filled almost to the bursting point with the latest and best instruction in the noble science of bibliothecology , and soon to go forth to a waiting world and put into execution epoch-making schemes for the improvement of our public libraries , now bestow their critical attention on the crying needs , the lamentably obsolete methods , of the larger libraries in their neigh - borhood , and subject the officers of these institutions to a searching test as to their professional qualifications and their fitness for their positions . ''

		Do you keep a shelf-list , and if not , why not ? '' ''

		Let us see your accessions-list . ''

		`` Explain your system of ordering . '' ''

		Do you carefully collate each book on its receipt ? '' ''

		Do you use the
Dewey	PERSON	or the Cutter classification ?

		What 's that ?

		You do n't use either of them ?

		Then how in the name of the
A. L. A.	PERSON	do you ever find a book when you want it ? '' ''

		Do you make analytical entries in cataloguing public documents ? ''

		`` Explain your charging system , please , and let us have samples of your membership cards , call-shps , delinquent notices , application forms , book-labels , and copies of your latest bulletin . ''

		Pending this inspection and examination , the regular work of the library is intermitted , and all hands are mustered as for a fire-drill , the fire coming in a raking volley from these pencil-equipped and notebook - armed '' members of the senior class . ''

		• • • The call of the stage comes irresistibly to many young persons who fancy themselves histrionically gifted , peculiarly endowed with the dramatic temperament .

		To all such would-be wearers of sock or buskin Miss
Julia Marlowe	PERSON	addresses some words of advice in a recent lecture before the students of
Raddiffe College	ORGANIZATION	.

		After dwelling on the actor 's need of broad culture , and after emphasizing the truth that '' above all is a know - ledge of the fimdamentals of literature indispensable , '' she says : '' Scarcely a week passes that I do not receive dozens , even hundreds , of letters from young people , who tell me that they wish to act and who ask me to advise them as to how they shall begin .

		Almost invari - ably the writers of these letters confide to me that they have temperament ; very , very seldom do any of them say that they are taking courses in singing , in gymnastics , and above all , in dramatic literature .

		It would interest me much more were they to say that they were doing any of these things ; not because they are more import - ant or as important as the possession of temperament , but because it does not often happen that any person is endowed with that rare and imique gift which we call temperament .

		We have all observed that those persons who say they have a sense of humor never really have it .

		Its very presence would prevent their dwelling upon it .

		This holds quite as true of persons who have tem - perament .

		Almost never does anyone who thinks he has it really possess it .

		To be sure , most people do think they have it .

		How many , I wonder , in my audience to-day , think they have not ? ''

		• • • The fiction-fed public that patronizes the free library is always making moan ` because more novels , and more copies of the most popular novels , are not bought for its delectation .

		It is a thirst that will be slaked , probably , on the day when the toper turns down his glass and declares his craving forever satisfied ; but not before .

		Public libraries turn to this clamor an ear of varying degrees of deafness .

		The
Boston	LOCATION	library , for example , has in three consecutive years purchased 129 , 161 , and 167 novels from the great mass of current English fiction examined by its committee .

		The city of
Trenton	LOCATION	,
N.J.	LOCATION	-LRB- we cite the instance as the strongest possible contrast -RRB- , added to its public library in the last year , if the Seventh Annual Report is to be trusted , no fewer than
1882	DATE	works of fiction , its purchases of other books being only 357 in excess of this number , and its total of volumes on the shelves not quite forty thousand .

		It circulated 131,244 works of fiction , besides 54,284 juvenile books -- how many of the latter were story - books is not reported , but one could venture a tolerable guess .

		In non-fiction , 25,495 volumes were drawn .

		The
Trenton	LOCATION	library maintains an excellent open-shelf reference department and permits an almost limitless borrowing of serious works on one card ; but , unless we have misread its Report , it believes in feeding the imagination with fiction more unstintedly than any other public library of which we have knowledge .

		• • • The income from literary work is always a matter of interest , possibly because the attempt to live by writing prose or verse , like the attempt to live by himting and fishing , appeals to our sense of sport .

		The writer 's chase of that rare , wild animal , the five - franc piece , has all the excitement and precariousness and high-bred scorn of danger of the hunter 's trade .

		Probably no man 's gains are so usually over-estimated as the author 's .

		Mr.
Laurence Hutton	PERSON	some years ago gave the public a glimpse into his profit account which must have been surprising to people who think of liter - ature as a prosperous profession .

		Mr.
William M. Rossetti	PERSON	in his volumes '' Some Reminiscences '' is more explicit .

		He says that between
1869	DATE	and
1894	DATE	his literary income averaged about one hundred pounds a year .

		This was the period when he was very much in the public eye by reason of a multitude of articles and essays and not a few published books .

		Estimating by reputation and influence , one would have supposed his receipts to have been ten times this amount .

		For - tunately , like so many Englishmen of letters , he held a government post which secured him a competent income .

		There is no pose in his straightforward biogi-aphy , but one can read through the lines that he was the good angel of the
House of Rossetti	ORGANIZATION	, exemplary in his duties as a son , brother , and father .

		That a writer so widely known and so industrious could only clear the meagre amount stated above is a revelation .

		• • ■ A CLOSE parallelism exists between
Alfred de Musset	ORGANIZATION	's '' Night of
December	DATE	'' -- the most sombre of the four '' Nights '' -- and
Poe	PERSON	's powerful tale , ``
William Wilson	PERSON	. ''

		In both a man is haunted from childhood to middle age by a figure which changes as he changes and which finally turns out to be a projection of himself .


1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 203 The '' Night '' was written in
November , 1835	DATE	, and may very well have been known to Poe .

		Of course the idea was not new with de Musset .

		In
Calderon	PERSON	's `` Purgatory of
St. Patrick	LOCATION	'' there is a creation -- Embozado -- which dogs the hero 's steps , embarrasses him by appearance , confronts him again and again , until he turns upon it with drawn sword , when it drops its mask and cloak and stands there , the man himself .

		In the original legend upon which Calderon embroidered , the idea was of pieces of paper which kept dropping from the sky at a man 's feet and upon each of which he found inscribed his own name .

		One of
Gdngora	ORGANIZATION	's ballads has a similar motive .

		A man is on his way to an assignation with a nun .

		A funeral procession with lighted candles crosses his path .

		He follows it .

		The train enters a church and the bier is deposited before the altar .

		He approaches it and draws the cloth from the dead man 's face -- and beholds his own .

		The idea has been used by
Rossetti	PERSON	in both picture and verse , and , of course , by
Hawthorne	PERSON	and
Stevenson	PERSON	; but de Musset 's beautiful development of it is probably less known .

		• • • Population growth axd book-circulation GROWTH do not always proceed pari passu .

		It is encouraging to find in the public library report , just issued , of a typical
New England	LOCATION	city -- a not excep - tionally intellectual city , and one too near the great libraries of
Boston	LOCATION	to serve as an ideal example -- that while during the last twenty years the population has increased by about two hundred and seventeen per cent , the home circulation of the library has grown three hundred and four per cent ; and the total use of Ubrary books shows a gain of three hundred and
fifty-four per cent	MONEY	.

		`` These figures indicate , '' continues the report -LRB- of the Maiden ,
Mass.	LOCATION	, public library -RRB- , '' that the use of the library by the people has become more general , and that it has outstripped the growth of the city , even though a supply of the most ephemeral and worthless popular literature has not been provided . ''

		We know , from personal inspection , that the
Ubrary	ORGANIZATION	's purchases of books have been , in general , governed by wisdom . ''

		It has not been the policy of the management , '' says President
D. P. Corey	PERSON	, of the
Board of Trustees	ORGANIZATION	, '' to increase the circulation by sensational appeals and methods and an apparent activity that is superficial rather than real ... Adapting the words of a recent writer , the library has given attention to ` the strengthening of its simple primary functions rather than to the invention of new schemes to attract more patrons , ' thus avoiding the danger of giving an inadequate service in many varied activities , some of which may be of no real benefit to the pubhc . ''

		A wise conservatism , this , and one that has produced good results .

		• • • Meredithian ECHOES , the dying reverberations of plaudits and huzzas raised in celebration of the octoge - narian novelist 's birthday , continue to strike on the ear from various quarters .

		American admiration of Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	is recognized by the editor of the
London	LOCATION	'' Book Monthly '' in a pleasant article describing his visit to
Boxhill	PERSON	on the veteran writer 's eightieth birth - day . ''

		For years , '' he says , '' American admirers of Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	have found their way to Boxhill -- more Americans than English , -- and in his frank , kindly way he has received them , if only to say how glad he was to do so . ''

		This preponderance of trans-Atlantic visitors illustrates again the attraction lent by distance to the view .

		It is not the
Boston	LOCATION	!

		an who climbs
Bunker Hill Monument	ORGANIZATION	, or the Philadelphian who makes a practice of spending his
Sunday	DATE
afternoon	TIME	at the grave of Franklin ; but the stranger from
Kalamazoo	LOCATION	and
Oshkosh	ORGANIZATION	insists on these things as of the first importance .

		But apart from the mere fascination of the remote , Amer - ican recognition of European genius has ever been prompt and generous -- a discernment of which we have reason to be proud .

		It is a pleasure to learn from the '' Book Monthly '' that Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	'' is as brilliant as ever in intellect , and his voice still has the music of the spheres , as
Gladstone	ORGANIZATION	's and Queen Victoria 's had unto the last . ''

		... Preparations for the Milton tercentenary , to be held in
London	LOCATION	next
December	DATE	, are now in progress .

		Preluding that main performance comes the exhibition of important Miltoniana at the
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	Libi-ary -- a display which , in unique items , is said to be unsurpassable even in the poet 's own country .

		Through Professor
Simkhovitch	PERSON	's zealous efforts has been gath - ered together a great array of first and other rare editions of
Milton	LOCATION	's writings , with other relics dear to the bibliophile and to the antiquary .

		Of chief interest is the original printer 's manuscript , with the official
Hcense	PERSON	, of the first book of `` Paradise Lost . ''

		This manuscript -- thirty-three quarto pages in the hand - writing of the blind poet 's amanuensis -- is a part of the '' copy '' from which
Peter Parker	PERSON	in
1667	DATE	prmted for
Samuel Simmons	PERSON	, holder of the copyright , the early editions of the poem .

		On the inside of a leaf at the beginning is the license , in autograph , of the Rev.
Thomas Tomkyns	PERSON	, press censor of the period .

		So far as is known , this is the sole surviving fragment of the original manuscript of the great epic ; and it is not surprising that it brought #
5000	DATE	at private sale four years ago .

		What bit of inked paper , unless it might be an autograph copy of a Shakespeare sonnet or play , would the lover of English literature value more highly ?

		Its present owner is Mr.
J. Pierpont Morgan	PERSON	.

		• • • The Puritan father of Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	may possibly not have been so ungenial a specimen of father - hood as the reader has been led to infer from the pages of that remarkable book , `` Father and Son . ''

		Those who are curious in this matter and can gain access to ''
Longmans	PERSON	' Magazme '' for
March , 1889	DATE	, will find there a contribution from the pen of Philip
Henry Gosse	PERSON	, F.R.S. -LRB- the '' father '' of the book -RRB- , entitled '' A Country Day-School Seventy Years Ago . ''

		A corre - spondent of the
London	LOCATION	`` Athenseum '' calls attention to this article as being '' full of humor and knowledge of boy life , and not at all priggish or Puritanical . ''

		He adds that '' the stories of school life therein show that the writer thoroughly understood it , and make the reader wonder if the ' Father ' did not understand the ' Son ' better than the Son now thinks he did , and was quite so severe or mirthless as the book would make one fancy . ''

		Yet the child 's impressions , deep and lasting , were what they were ; and whatever the charm of this article written in the mellowness of age , one must believe that it was an austere experience to which the boy was subjected .

		• • • A LIBRARY WITH A BRISK CIRCULATION , SO brisk indeed as to cause some astonishment when its com - paratively rural location is considered , is the
Washington	LOCATION
County Free Library	ORGANIZATION	at
Hagerstown	LOCATION	,
Md.	LOCATION	.

		This insti - tution , with its imique book-wagon and door-to-door delivery and collection of books , has more than once 204 THE DIAL -LSB- AprU 1 , received honorable mention in our columns ; and it now appears that its fair fame has spread far beyond the limits , not only of
Maryland	LOCATION	, but of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		When the librarian of the
Yamaguchi	PERSON	-LRB-
Japan	LOCATION	-RRB- Public Library asked our government for the latest information concerning the best means of reaching country districts with library books , he was referred to this
Hagerstown	LOCATION	library as a model for his study .

		This and many other interesting facts are set forth in the 1906-7 report of the library , wherein is announced the remarkable achieve - ment of having circulated 91,856 volumes with a total of 18,095 with which to do it -- an average of more than five lendings per volume .

		Besides the central building , there are seventy-one deposit stations through - out the county ; thirty-nine schools are also in receipt of books ; and the book - wagon visited fifteen of the remoter villages .

		The Report , with its eight attractive illustrations , is a credit to the library .

		• • • Chinese ideographs , which have not only served the literary needs of
China	LOCATION	herself for centuries , but have also proved a potent mstrument in enabling
Japan	LOCATION	to assimilate the literature and civilization of her next - door neighbor , are now likely to give place , to an increasing extent , to the alphabet used by the western world .

		At a late meeting in Tokio of the promoters of this desirable substitution .

		Count
Okuma	ORGANIZATION	made an ani - mated address in its favor .

		As a mere matter of fiscal economy , the removal of this barrier to international communication would save the Empire a large annual outlay for clerks and copyists whose functions would cease with the introduction of alphabetic writing and printing .

		It is curious to note the coincidence of this movement with the invention of an elaborate and ingen - ious ideograph type-writer -LRB- if that is not a contradiction in terms -RRB- ; but the native symbols are likely long to remain in home use .

		• • • To LOVERS OF THE LeATHERSTOCKING TaLES it will come as a welcome announcement that a
Fenimore Cooper Statue Association	ORGANIZATION	has been formed , with
Presi	PERSON	- dent
Eliot of Harvard	ORGANIZATION	as chairman , and a committee including such prominent names as Rudyard Kapling ,
Brander Matthews	PERSON	,
Thomas R. Lounsbury	PERSON	, and
Donald G. Mitchell	PERSON	.

		It is proposed to erect at
Cooperstown	LOCATION	,
N.Y.	LOCATION	, -- not his birthplace , for he was born at
Burlington	LOCATION	,
N. J.	PERSON	, but his deathplace , if one may say so -- a bronze or marble statue of this first great American romancer .

		The committee feels that it is high time , and the right time , to pay this tribute to one who has given and is still giving so much wholesome entertainment to his fellow-countrymen ; and hope is entertained that young and old will unite to make the testimonial a worthy one .

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		AN UNREACHED GOAL .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		The impulse to translate a charming thing into one 's mother-tongue will continue to assert itself as long as the world has more languages than one .

		As regularly it will be chilled by the knowledge that either some evaporation of the essence or some deviation from the form is certain to occur in the process , even under the best conditions .

		But again and again the impulse has its way -- defending itself by the claim that other - wise the treasure must be wholly unknown to many a reader .

		Here follows an attempt to reproduce in English a '' very perfect little thing '' of which Professor
Saints	PERSON	- bury gives the original in his '' Periods of European Literature :
Later Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Of its author , the Austrian
Baroness Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach	PERSON	, he says : '' She can not be missed as among the most un - doubted possessors of really poetic spirit who have written in German during the
last half century	DATE	. ''

		And upon the poem he makes this comment : `` It will be observed that this has not only the right German senti - ment , but is a most happy exemplification of the poetic capacities of the German tongue itself , in the repeated sighings or breathings of the final e in the last line , with the full vowel sound of the preceding syllables contrast - ing , supporting , and embellishing them .

		In much read - ing of modern German verse , it will not be easy to find an example of equal scale better in itself , or better illustrat - ing the unforced and natural character of the best work of the same kind in the same country . '' ''

		Ein kleines Lied , wie geht 's nur an , Dass man so lieb ea haben kann , Was liegt darin ?

		A tiny song -- O , what 's the art That makes it dear to every heart ?

		I wait now for your telling .

		A song is something that can ring -- A little melody and swing • -- And a whole soul there indwelling !

		Now will some other contributor be inspired to make a more felicitous effort toward attaining the unattain - able ?

		If so , the
Baroness von Ebner-Eschenbach	PERSON	's publishers , the
Gebriider Paetel	PERSON	of

America	LOCATION	which they have granted to the present translator .

		The communication in your issue of
Feb. 1	DATE	, by
Thomas H. Briggs	PERSON	, on '' Problems of the Smaller Libraries , '' must necessarily appeal very strongly to librarians who do not have at their disposal larger libraries to consult .

		There is such possibility for an diversity of opinion as to how a book may be classified under the
Dewey Decimal System	ORGANIZATION	that one is often at a loss to know exactly where to place a new publication .

		My attention is particularly called to this fact relative to
James	PERSON	's `` * Pragmatism . ''

		Three catalogues listing the monthly additions to the libraries , published by prominent libraries in the
East	LOCATION	, each give a different classification for this book .

		One has `` 190 , Modern Philosophers '' ; one `` 191 , American Philosophers '' ; one '' 199 , Other Modem Philosophers . ''

		Still another catalogue gives it as '' 150 , Mental faculties .

		THE DIAL 205 t l ^ to l00ks .

		A
Noteworthy Tilden Aetebmath	ORGANIZATION	.

		* The nonagenarian editor of the '' Letters and Literary Memorials of
Samuel J. Tilden	PERSON	'' finds himself on familiar ground , dealing as he does with political history and biography all of which he saw , so far as a contemporary could , and part of which he was -- a considerable part , too , first and last .

		Mr.
John Bigelow	PERSON	, the senior executor of
Tilden	PERSON	's will , the author of a standard Life of the man , and the editor of a selection from his writings and speeches , which was published the year before Mr.
Tilden	PERSON	's death , has had the sift - ing of a mountain of manuscript in the twenty - two years since the testator 's will was opened and it was foimd that its forty-second clause provided for the publication of such further papers as his trustees and executors should judge worthy of preservation in book form .

		In all that he wrote , even in the composition of his school exercises and the penning of the most informal letter or note ,
Tilden	PERSON	seems to have had posterity before his mind 's eye ; his utterances were addressed , one might almost say primarily addressed , to an audience beyond the grave .

		He took his life and his doings with tremendous seriousness .

		The editor accounts for this in part by the fact that even as a youth he had , by both pen and speech , won the re - spectful attention of the leading statesmen of the day .

		At school , we are told , '' he preserved all his composition exercises , and from that time to the close of his life it may well be doubted if he ever wrote a note or document of any kind of which he did not preserve the draft or copy . ''

		Small wonder , therefore , that the accumulated manuscript dealing with its writer 's fifty years of active public life should have to be measured by the cord and weighed by the ton .

		In the some - what grandiloquent language of the editor , -- '' The duty imposed upon his executors of looking through such a vast collection of papers and selecting such as would be profitable for publication has been a long and a very tedious one .

		They indulge the hope , however , that the volumes now submitted will be found to shed upon the history of our country during the lat -
ter half of the last century	DATE	much light unlikely to be reflected with equal lustre from any other quarter .

		It will also , they believe , help to transmit to posterity a juster sense than as yet generally prevails of the majes - tic proportions of one of the most gifted statesmen our country has produced . ''

Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	.

		that of
Israel	LOCATION	's second king in being a life of almost constant warfare -- a warfare that made him more or less liable to be viewed with par - tisan eyes and judged with but partial justice .

		The passage of time is necessary for the true perspective ; and so , continues the editor , with another Biblical illustration , '' we only see a public man as he is entitled to be seen , as
Moses	PERSON	was permitted to see his Lord : after he had passed , '' These and other passages in Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	's preface leave the reader fully confi - dent that the words and acts of Mr.
Tilden	PERSON	will have no editorial construction put upon them that might seem harshly unjust to his admirers .

		He is in tender hands .

		Perhaps the strongest note of anything like disapproval is struck in the following commentary on - his view of the slavery question in
1853	DATE	: `` It was at this stage of
Pierce	ORGANIZATION	's administration that
Tilden	PERSON	began to indulge in the deplorable error of walk - ing by sight and not by faith .

		He did not believe , nor did he ever again seem to comprehend , that in the slave States all other questions , even the Constitution of our government and the integrity of our territory , were subordinate throughout the South to the preserva - tion and extension of slavery ; that every person who ventured publicly to express a doubt of the wisdom of allowing slavery to extend to the free Territories was pronounced there a suspect , and was proscribed as a per - son who tainted every one who associated with him politically .

		The Nullifiers saw , and saw correctly , that the anti-slavery sentiment could only be resisted in
America	LOCATION	as heresy was resisted by
Louis XIV	ORGANIZATION	.

		in
France	LOCATION	-- by crushing the heretics or driving them from the country .

		To reason with
Pierce	PERSON	-LSB- as
Tilden	PERSON	had done in a letter evoking this comment -RSB- in favor of dispensing his patronage in the State of
New York	LOCATION	in accordance with the public opinion of
the State	ORGANIZATION	, was as idle as the lamb 's reasoning with the wolf in the fable . ''

		To illustrate the cardinal events in
Tilden	LOCATION	's public life , such as his part in the Tweed Ring exposures and his trying experience as presi - dential candidate , one would have liked , and would have expected , to find many letters from his pen giving an intimate view of his opinions and feelings ; but though friendly and admiring tributes in abundance from his correspondents are printed , there seems to have been at the editor 's disposal a far less ample supply of answers to these correspondents .

		At any rate , just what we most curiously look for at these interesting periods we fail to discover .

		As a specimen of his letter-writing , the following sufficiently self-explanatory paragraph , from a note to
Eugene Casserly	PERSON	, dated
July 3 , 1872	DATE	, has an interest to those old enough to remember the political situation of that time : '' The

		Our people , in being educated to favor it , had become accustomed to count on it , and at last became dependent upon it .

		I never saw how its acts were capable of readjustment , or how the question now before us would be other than the simple issue between
Grant	ORGANIZATION	and
Greeley	LOCATION	.

		On this I concur with the instinctive sense of our people that a change is necessary in the
Federal	ORGANIZATION	administration .

		It is rarely , if ever , possible for a party in office to reform itself by the internal force of its best elements .

		We must have a better state of thuigs in national ,
State	ORGANIZATION	, and municipal government , and a higher standard in the public mind by which official men will be tried and to which they will refer in their silent meditations and in their actions , if we would preserve anything of value in our political system . ''

		Coming down a few years later , we find many cordially sympathetic and eulogistic communica - tions to the man counted out by the Electoral Com - mission called upon to decide a memorable dispute .

		Letters from
General McClellan	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Charles Francis Adams	PERSON	, and Mr.
Abram S. Hewitt	PERSON	are especially noteworthy .

		Mr.
Adams	PERSON	writes : `` On this day -LSB-
March 5 , 1877	DATE	-RSB- when you ought to have been the President of these
United States	LOCATION	, I seize the opportunity to bear my testimony to the calm and dignified manner in which you have passed through this great trial .

		It is many years since I ceased to be a party man .

		Hence I have endeavored to judge of public affairs and men rather by their merits than by the names they take .

		It is a source of gratification to me to think that I made the right choice in the late election .

		I could never have been reconciled to the elevation by the smallest aid of mine of a person , how - ever respectable in private life , who must forever carry upon his brow the stamp of fraud first triumphant in American history .

		No subsequent action , however meritorious , can wash away the letters of that record . ''

		Every page of these volumes will be inter - esting to those whose favorite reading and study is in the political history of our country , and especially interesting if they have lived through the years , or any considerable part of them , covered by the correspondence and other occa - sional writings selected for publication .

		These documents reveal a mind shrewd , alert , judicial , delighting in argument but not in heated debate , and always maintaining a certain cool dignity and reserve even where a little show of heat or even irritation might have been not out of place .

		Amid the many and illustrious names of states - men and diplomats with which the pages are sprinkled , it is pleasant now and then -- but the occasions are extremely rare -- to come across a name known in literature .

		That of
Hawthorne	LOCATION	lights up one page , by the merest accident , and that of Bryant another .

		In its very manner of expression , its choice of words , the poet-editor 's note , brief though it is , forms a refreshing contrast to the invariably formal and correct -LRB- and sometimes turgidly platitud - inous -RRB- deliverances of those other great ones whose capable hands were more occupied in moulding the destinies of nations than in pen - ning letters that should live and breathe to after generations by reason of that unfailing preserva - tive of written speech -- charm of style . ''

		I have called at your office twice to-day on some business of my own , '' writes Bryant . ''

		WiU you oblige me by letting me know when you are in your office , that I may come and bore you ? ''

		That is all , but it is enough to make one search the subsequent pages for some reference to the boring , when -LRB- or if -RRB- it actually took place .

		But the name , having once emerged to cheer the vision , comes not again to the surface in any but the most casual and unsatisfactory manner .

		The appreciation of Mr.
Tilden	PERSON	contributed to '' The Atlantic Monthly '' in
1892	DATE	by the late
James Coolidge Carter	PERSON	is reprinted as an introduction to the letters .

		It is curious to note , in the brief reference to
Tilden	PERSON	's governorship , a situation closely paralleled to-day by a state of affairs not a thousand miles from
Albany	LOCATION	.

		The Tammany Hall leaders , scenting danger in the Governor 's reform plans , united with the so - called Canal Ring in a vigorous warfare against him , and he found himself in peril of being deserted by a majority of his own party . ''

		The Democratic Speaker of the Assembly took the floor and arraigned him as unfaithful to the Democracy of the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		He had long before seen the possibility of this combination against him , and had sought by the practice of all the conciliatory arts of which he was a thorough master , to prevent it .

		When it came , he was not daunted by it , but boldly went behind his enemies to the constituencies which they were betraying .

		They soon found that they were dealing with an adversary who possessed resources which they had not taken into account .

		Most of them abandoned their opposition .

		The rest were severely dealt with by their constituents . ''

		THE DIAL 207 of the brilliant Gallic master ; and all the oper - ating causes have come dangerously near turn - ing him into une religion anglaise , if we may modify one of his own references to Chau - teaubriand .

		Nor , on the whole , is the homage undeserved ; for with his contributions criticism entered upon a newer and higher life .

		After the achievements of Sainte-Beuve , it was clear once for all that criticism '' must never be con - tent with the mere study of outward conditions , sources , and influences ; but must use these only to press on to the discovery of what each artist , inalienably , uniquely , brings -- of that within him which determines what influences he shall accept . ''

		The impotent ponderosity of unimagi - native erudition and the arrogant self-confidence of half - trained intuition will not soon die all in all ; but they have been robbed of most of their power .

		Unreasoning vituperation has been driven from the field , although , unfortunately , it has not seldom been replaced by an equally unreasoning amiability .

		Even this insipidity , however , has felt the new life , and will soon be as innocuous as it is ridicidous .

		A sane scien - tific method , based upon sound scholarship and enhanced by imaginative appreciation , has been bequeathed to us by the '' greatest of literary historians . ''

		In his opening address at the Uni - versity of
Liege	LOCATION	, in
1848	DATE	, he said : `` Les etudes positives et s ^ v ^ res sont la base de tout
Acqu	ORGANIZATION	^ rez le solide ... Mais k cot ^ , mais au-dessus , laissez place k un jjeu de fantaisie , si elle veut naitre , -- k la flamme sur le front d' lule , -- uon pas sur le front seulement , mais dans le cceur . ''

		And these words have always seemed to us strikingly applicable to the master who uttered them .

		The reference to lulus recalls his sound and indispensable knowledge of the classics ; the '' exacting studies '' suggest his accurate scholarship and his minute patient training in method ; the demand for '' un peu de fantaisie '' points toward his penetrating and illuminating imagination .

		Such a leader was worthy of his most distinguished followers .

		In Professor Elton 's volume of '' Modern Studies , '' the spirit of Sainte-Beuve is unob - trusively but persistently present .

		The author appreciates fully the inevitable classic criticism of such a man as
Hazlitt	PERSON	.

		Like most of us , he turns with special eagerness to the judgments passed by a craftsman upon his fellows ; and he rightly places Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's literary verdicts high in the scale , despite '' their enormous panegyric or superlative damnation . ''

		But primarily our author represents the academic school with which we began .

		Naturally , there is no trace in his pages either of journalism masquerading as criticism , or of the scintillating pertness of the
Shaw or Chesterton	ORGANIZATION	type .

		Neither do we find the more pardonable , more ambitious , paradox of Oscar Wilde , that criti - cism is superior to creativeness ; although to the former .

		Professor Elton assigns no lowly functions .

		He believes that criticism should be keen and incisive , and forward-moving , if we may be pardoned the expression .

		It must be absolutely impartial to the writer ; must be rationally based ; and , above all , must quicken , instead of deaden , the literary instinct in the reader .

		In this spirit Professor Elton has written upon such themes as `` Recent Shake - speare Criticism , '' '' Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's Poems , '' `` Mr.
George Meredith	PERSON	, '' `` Living Irish Lit - erature , '' and so forth .

		Two or three of the essays in the collection are not primarily literary criticism , notably the important and attractive treatment of ``
Giordano Bruno	PERSON	in
England	LOCATION	'' ; but for most readers the interest of the volume will be due to the qualities above suggested .

		The author 's general outlook is perhaps most definitely suggested by the section on '' The Meaning of Literary History . ''

		Herein the central tenet is that `` literature , being an art , must belong to the world and disown the quar - rels of the nations . ''

		While the thought is not new , our author has ably worked it out with reference to present conditions , and with a pleas - ing freedom from vagaries .

		He does not fall into the idtimately philistine mistake of desiring that the nations shall be in accord on all points , and speak with one literary voice .

		And we gladly note his concession that variety is a vital necessity for art , whereof the aim is to give plea - sure through beauty , by realizing '' in unique unchanging form the spirit of the individual . ''

		Knowledge is international or nothing ; science is impersonal and above race ; but literature neither can nor should altogether escape national limitations .

		Difference of language is one very tangible barrier . ''

		The inner cell of the poet 's mind is not hung with charts or diagrams of doctrine that are equally true or false in every idiom .

		It is peopled with wandering times that seek their appointed thought , and lonely phrases that seek a completing cadence , until at last , from some chance union that eludes all our psychology , the immortal word is born .

		And this can not be trans - ferred to another tongue . ''

		But in the face of all difficulties , literature must strive to be cosmopolitan . ''

		It must join with education and science , the forces that unite , and not with those that , serve for estrange - ment , such as racial distrust and war ; or civilization wastes a chance . ''

		The essay then goes on to discuss the changing 208 THE DIAL -LSB- AprH 1 , ideals of literary history , and to point out the growth of the study of literature from the inter - national side in
France	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	, and `` the States . ''

		In this connection ,
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	receives a well-deserved tribute for its '' series of books -- not little theses , but books -- on various aspects of Tudor litera - ture . ''

		Such intelligent collaboration appeals with force to Professor Elton , and he looks forward very eagerly to its spreading in the mother country .

		However , there is no undue deference to '' the States , '' for he feels that on the whole the Englishman has a more rational schooling than the more enterprising American , and writes a better and fresher style ; so that the results would be correspondingly more valu - able if the system of collaboration were once set in motion .

		The paper concludes with some short chapters in review of Dr.
Courthope	PERSON	's '' History of English Poetry '' and Professor
Saintsbury	PERSON	's '' Short History of English Liter - ature . ''

		Throughout the reviews , Professor Elton succeeds in bringing his authors into relation with his central subject , while passing careful criticism upon their books .

		With refer - ence to the '' Short History , '' we may steal space to venture the deliberate opinion that it is rated by our critic considerably higher than it deserves .

		However , '' the catholic connois - seurship '' of Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	, even if not infrequently fallible , does associate itself help - fully with the idea of a federal literature in which Professor Elton is so laudably interested .

		The inaugural lecture on
Tennyson	PERSON	and the review of the collected edition of Mr.
Swin	PERSON	- burne 's poems exhibit our author 's critical method , and at the same time support one of the fimdamental tenets voiced in the section we have been discussing .

		Being an academic critic , he naturally concedes the necessity of understanding '' certain impersonal forces , which from age to age tend to prescribe the form and aim of poetry and to beleaguer it about . '' ''

		They play upon each artist in difFerent proportions , fitfully and with no steady pressure .

		But there are other forces that he beyond analysis , namely , those which move the artist and decide how he shall choose among these floating tendencies in the mind of his time , how he shall combine or alter them , what he shall accept of them .

		Tendencies , it naust be repeated , have no real existence , except in the shapes in which the individual mind chooses to submit to them ... The mind is not a cauldron in which certain ingredients simmer mechani - cally , so that a certain result can be expected .

		No ; the
Time-Spirit	ORGANIZATION	says a charm over the cauldron , and imborn shapes arise out of it ; it is only a third-rate writer who can be analysed away into ' influences . ' ''

		The juxtaposition of the articles on the two antithetical Victorians may have been acci - dental ; but it remains a felicitous auxiliary of the above contention .

		Many of the '' imper - sonal forces '' acting upon
Tennyson	PERSON	and Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	were identical ; but the Zeitgeist has seldom evoked more dissimilar shapes from his cauldron .

		At heart , the late Laureate was in sympathy with the '' stable , immemorial , dignified English society . ''

		His younger con - temporary found his keenest life in the ringing revolutionary cry that centred about
Mazzini	PERSON	.

		Tennyson was ever anxious to make the new wine of nineteenth century thought enter peace - fully into the old bottles of accepted religion .

		Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	would not merely allow the old bottles to sink quietly into disuse , -- he would burst them even dramatically , and would fairly bathe in the new wine as in his beloved sea .

		And so the contrast might be carried on , until the two poets should be seen in almost antipodean opposition .

		Such expressions as '' a child of his age '' or '' an inevitable product of environment '' have been thrown about most profusely since the application of science to literature ; but they would seem to require pretty careful weighing if they are to retain much real meaning .

		And this is one of the principal values of such work as is contained in the present volume ; for Pro- fessor Elton never loses sight of individual per - sonalities in the influences operating upon them .

		Furthermore , his estimate of these two makers of verse seems to us thoroughly sane , and as nearly adequate as the compulsory brev - ity of his treatment would permit .

		The almost reverent attitude toward
Tennyson	PERSON	has made it not altogether easy to assert his weaknesses .

		The height of his purpose , the purity of his life , the quiet dignity of his individuality , the great - ness of his character , united to make his beauti - ful poetry seem more nearly perfect than it was .

		But when all the garlands are bestowed , the fact remains that much of his work is marred by what the Germans call Halbheit .

		Compromise may have been the secret of
England	LOCATION	's parlia - mentary strength ; but it is not the essence of final poetry .

		And this our author insists upon , without belittling the exceptional services of the poet or failing to applaud his wonderfid achievements .

		Into his more detailed criticism we may not enter ; but here , likewise , the scales are held in admirable balance .

		To Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's poetry we shall long turn for his young-hearted yearning toward beauty and his determined will to learn its meaning ; for his unequalled voicing of the mysterious but inevitable amor mortis that
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 209 sways and perturbs every adolescent heart ; for his desperate love of liberty and his moral passion for mankind , as seen in the poems of the
Mazzini	PERSON	period .

		He has helped us more than any other modem Englishman to understand that '' the emotions of fraternity and self-sacrifice and ulti - mate hope are the lyric poet 's true material . ''

		Many who can not love the soul of his poetry must admire the form in which it is embodied .

		The infinite musical resource of his metres is almost incredible .

		And yet , when all this is conceded , we may acquiesce in Professor Elton 's judicial verdict that '' Much of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's song and lyric for twenty - years has been performance rather than creation .

		No one else could write it ; it is sincere ; but it perishes like the scud or the cloud-wreath , in the act of formation .

		His true power during that long interval lies in prose and drama . ''

		Even in moral feeling , as well as in effect , the rebellious poet might have gained if he could have escaped a certain lack of measure in assail - ing some of his favorite antipathies .

		As a caustic reviewer said some years ago , he might have been less bitter toward God and Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	.

		With his striking merits and defects before us , it would be unwise to hazard very con - fident vaticinations about his treatment at the hands of the future . ''

		The fame of a profuse and unequal and unresting writer has of necessity to wait longer than that of one who , like
Dante Grabriel Rossetti	PERSON	, winnows his work and saves only that which possesses the utmost intensity and perfection , and who is thus his own anthologist .

		Yet the ultimate garland of the more spendthrift singer may prove to be not less in quantity , as it will certainly not rank lower in beauty of its own noble order . ''

		In our present mood we should not hesitate to say that Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	will rank higher than his fellow-singer of the brotherhood ; but the conservatism of the quoted verdict may be sounder , as it is certainly safer .

		The other sections we must regretfully leave undiscussed . ''

		Recent Shakespeare Criticism '' and '' Living Irish Literature '' will particularly repay careful reading . ''

		Colour and Imagery in Spenser `` is by no means on a level with the other papers .

		Nor is '' Literary Fame : A Renaissance Note '' quite worthy of its best com - panions because of a little suggestion of '' the thesis factory , '' albeit we shoidd immediately add that the factory is of an exceptionally high type .

		Professor Elton 's style answers to the de - mands we have a right to make upon an able critic who occupies an important chair of English Literature .

		He never fails to write clearly ; he is not afraid to write finely .

		Rarely is there any noticeable infelicity ; but inasmuch 1 as his ear is so thoroughly familiar with '' Maud '' we might have expected him to avoid such an annoying false echo as '' that with which no fault can be foimd , except that it is faultlessly null . ''

		The slip would be negligible in a less competent writer , and the very fact of our mentioning it may indicate the paucity of vul - nerable points .

		There is , however , a remote possibility of pedantry shadowed forth by the frequent use of proper adjectives or kindred devices .

		Thus , in six lines we have : `` Certainly
Bruno	PERSON	's Platonism misses the note of chivalry .

		His Rabelaisian fulness of life , which utters itself in his spendthrift eloquence , carries him far from his contemporary Tasso .

		He lacks
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's con - ception of love , just as he misses the strain of saintliness • that is heard in Spenser .

		Love to him is now a gaily Lampsacene appetite , '' etc. .

		But in the other essays this tendency is less marked , and inasmuch as the Bruno paper will be attractive primarily to the scholarly inclined , the trait is interesting rather than important .

		To any reader who has followed this notice , it will be clear that we are inclined to place a rather high value upon this latest volume by Professor Elton .

		His traditions of literary criticism are the best ; his appreciation of the growing importance of natural science in the literary field is significant of his keen and for - ward vision ; his advocacy of comparative lit - erature must win unhesitating approval ; his outlook on life is clear and wide ; his sym - pathies are at once advanced and catholic .

		It is not often that a collection of essays reprinted from contemporary magazines will be found to offer such satisfying mental pabulum .

		* In the preface to his latest book .

		Professor
Justin H. Smith	PERSON	refers to a criticism brought against his '' Troubadours at Home , '' that he had taken pains to be '' interesting , '' and to his own defence , that certain phases of his subject were essentially of such a nature that no account of them could be lifelike -- that is to say , true -- if it were not interesting .

		He anticipates a similar charge in the case of his present book , and repeats his former defence . ''

		But , '' he adds , '' the intention has been to keep the requirements of critical investigation steadily in mind , and accept literary elements only for their sound * OcB Struggle for the

		210 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, historical worth . ''

		Until one has read his book -- that is , the book now under consideration -- this use of the word '' interesting '' is puzzling .

		Thereafter , its application may be seen , but the term remains somewhat misleading .

		Surely no reviewer could wish the presentation of history to be anything but '' interesting '' ?

		The point to which criticism was presumably directed in the '' Troubadours at Home , '' and to which it is more definitely applicable in '' Our Struggle for the
Fourteenth Colony	ORGANIZATION	, '' is not the fact that Dr.
Smith	PERSON	's treatment of his subjects has been made interesting , but rather the means by which that attractive quality was sought .

		It is open to grave question if the '' literary elements '' invoked by Dr.
Smith	PERSON	in the present instance are always marked by '' sound histor - ical worth . ''

		Even the undeniable charm of Parkman can not blind us to the fact that occa ^ sionaUy his desire for a picturesque or effective background clashed with his stern devotion to historic truth .

		And where
Parkman	PERSON	has stumbled , others are likely to fall .

		In his laudable effort to reconstruct an exceedingly interesting period of Colonial history , Dr.
Smith	PERSON	has made large and constant demands upon his imagination ; so much so that some of his chap - ters run perilously into the dangerous border - land between history and fiction , if they do not actually enter the territory of the latter .

		History is written nowadays for two fairly distinct classes -- the general reader and the student .

		The man capable of satisfying both is a rare genius , bom to the purple .

		The average historian who attempts to fill the double role , is doomed to failure .

		If content with the modest appreciation of students , he will build upon facts and facts alone , though there is no reason why his building should not be attract - ive and '' interesting . ''

		On the other hand , if he aspires to the loud applause of the multi - tude , he is free to imagine his facts and build upon that airy foundation a glittering palace of words .

		One must hasten to say that Dr.
Smith	PERSON	can - not be classed , except to a limited extent , with the latter group of writers .

		In the main his work reveals the most painstaking study of original documents .

		It is , in all seriousness , a monument of patient research , and unquestion - ably throws a great deal of new light upon the history of the attempt to win
Canada	LOCATION	to the cause of the
Thirteen Colonies	ORGANIZATION	.

		Where material was available in any form .

		Dr.
Smith	PERSON	has spared no possible pains to get at it ; and , with few exceptions , his interpretation has been all that the most exacting critic could demand .

		It is only where the documents were not available -- where they had been lost , or had never existed -- that he -LRB- one can not but think imadvisedly -RRB- fell back upon his imagination , and created scenes , incidents , or statements which might have hap - pened , but which there is no sufficient evidence to prove did happen .

		One need not go beyond the first few pages to find a case in point .

		The scene is the historic meeting in
Faneuil Hall	LOCATION	in
February , 1775	DATE	.

		The historian admits that '' if any records of the session were kept , they have disappeared , '' but this does not prevent him from reconstructing the scene , most vividly and effectively .

		Each of the patriots is described with minute care -- his character , appearance , the very clothes he wore ; eloquent speeches are put into the mouths of these fathers of the Revolution , speeches built up from their re - corded utterances on other occasions ; and we are even told , with dramatic impressiveness , how each speech was received by the little audience . ''

		Warming as he developed his ideas , '' says this daring historian , ''
Warren	PERSON	glowed before he was through like a coal from the altar ; and the slender company thrilled profoundly with that sense of majesty and awful earnestness which never failed to make the assembly shiver , '' and so on .

		Then
Adams	PERSON	spoke : '' We are to be a nation and a great one .

		To be prosperous we must have an extensive trade .

		This will require a respectable navy .

		Our ships must be manned , and the source of seamen is the fishery .

		Nova
Scotia	LOCATION	and
Canada	LOCATION	would be a great and permanent protection to the fishery .

		And further , the possession of these territories would prevent any view of
Britain	LOCATION	to disturb our peace in the future and cut off an important source of corrupt British influence . ''

		From a foot-note we learn that '' though this letter -LRB- the speech in
Faneuil HaU	LOCATION	in
1776	DATE	is borrowed -- shall we say -- from a letter of
Adams	PERSON	to
Cooper	PERSON	, dated
April 29th , 1779	DATE	-RRB- was written later , it seems highly prob - able ... that it represents his views in
1775	DATE	. ''

		The italics are the reviewer 's .

		Dr.
Smith	PERSON	even admits that '' a few slight changes have been made , '' -- in adapting the letter to the scenic requirements of Faneuil HaU .

		Now all this is very entertaining , and altogether calculated to stir the heart of the patriotic citizen , -- but is it history ?

		Again one must say , in justice to Dr.
Smith	PERSON	, that this highly imaginative style of narrative does not mark all the chapters of his book .

		The greater part of the second volume is sane history .

		One may not always agree with the author 's conclusions , but one can always respect them as founded upon un - questioned documentary evidence .

		It remains to note the excellent make-up of the book , with its more than three hundred admirably-selected illustrations and numerous maps , and its exhaustive index -- not the least of its many good qualities .

		Myth and Legend isr Japanese Art .

		* From whatever point of view Japanese works of art may be regarded , it is apparent upon even slight acquaintance that for full understanding some knowledge of their subjects is requisite .

		Not that this is necessary for appreciation of their beauty and artistic merit .

		These qualities , it can not too often be pointed out , have nothing to do with the subjects as such , but with the treatment .

		They depend not upon whether the artist has chosen to depict one theme rather than another , but upon such considerations as space arrangement , the placing of the light and dark masses , the blending of all the various details of composition , drawing , and color , into an organic and harmonic whole .

		But who , after having lingered lovingly over a charming net - suke or sword guard , or having had his soul stirred by the exquisite beauty of a color print or of a kakemono painted by a great master , does not wish to know something about its sub - ject ?

		And this desire is heightened when it is perceived that these works are built upon a wide range of poetic conceptions , a world of historic and legendary incident , little explored as yet by Western students .

		Hitherto the inquirer who has striven to pene - trate into this fascinating realm has had to seek information in all sorts of out-of-the-way places , sometimes having his patience rewarded , but more often failing in his quest .

		For those unable to read Japanese books the principal treasury upon which they could draw has been that vade mecum of every collector for twenty ♦ Legend in Japanese Art : A Description of Historical Episodes , Legendary Characters , Folk-Lore , Myths , Religrious Symbolism , Illustrated in the Arts of

		Dr.
William Anderson	PERSON	's '' Catalogue of the Japanese and Chinese Paintings in the British Museum , '' now long out of print and so scarce as to be hardly obtainable .

Monsieur Bertin	PERSON	's '' Les
Grandes Guerres Civiles	PERSON	du Japon , ''
Huish	PERSON	's ''
Japan	LOCATION	and its Art , '' and the '' Catalogue of the Tomkinson Collection , '' but they , too , are scarce , and the legendary lore they contain , though consider - able , comprises only a small fraction of the whole body .

		Very welcome , therefore , is the stout volume entitled `` Legend in Japanese Art , '' in which Mr.
Henri L. Joly	PERSON	has assembled a mass of legends , folk-tales , myths , proverbs , descrip - tions of religious symbols and of historical and fabulous personages and incidents , that far transcends anything heretofore available for reference .

		The book is the work of a collector who for many years has noted all the information he could gather concerning the objects in his own collection or those coming under his obser - vation .

		In making the compilation , Japanese illustrated books have been freely drawn upon , and from them the author has obtained much material not previously printed in any European language .

		The restdt is a quarto of more than 450 pages arranged upon the plan of an ency - clopedia , mainly under Japanese name headings , and containing over seven hundred half-tone illustrations and sixteen full-page process repro - ductions of color prints .

		To the collector it is a book that can not fail to prove indispensable .

		In the main it is accurate , the errors being few and of minor importance .

		The erratic spelling of Japanese words is , however , greatly to be regretted , since the forms used in a work of this kind are peculiarly liable to be copied by other writers .

		No definite system of phonetic transliteration has been followed .

		Any pretense to complete - ness is frankly disclaimed by the author .

		There are , indeed , some notable omissions , -- as for instance the story of the mendicant priest
Seigen	PERSON	, and that of
Ushiwaka	LOCATION	and the Princess Jorurihime , so often utilized by the print de - signers .

		And there is occasional mention of things that are left without explanation .

		More than once there is reference to the
Ushi	ORGANIZATION	toki mairi -LRB- more properly , Ushi no toki mairi -RRB- or '' envoutement at the hour of the ox , '' but strangely enough no account is given of this interesting superstitious rite or incantation not infrequently practiced by the Japanese in olden times in the hope of casting a spell upon an 212 THE DIAL -LSB-

		The most serious shortcoming is the lack of a full index with ample cross refer - ences .

		The alphabetical arrangement , and the long list of emblems and attributes with which the book opens , though designed to obviate the need for this , accomplish the purpose insuffi - ciently , as the reader soon discovers .

		For the student of folk lore the book also oifers much of interest .

		Many of the tales are highly entertaining .

		We read , for example , of
Genshiki	LOCATION	, one of the '' Seven Worthies of the Bamboo Grove , '' who could turn the white of his eyes to those he hated and the blue to those he loved , and who '' boated up the Milky Way up to the haunts of the Spinning Maiden , '' daughter of the Sun .

		The sages were indeed a marvellous lot of beings .

		The story of the famous journey of Chang K'ien , which is related by Mr.
Joly	PERSON	, may be quoted here as furnishing a curious analogue of that just mentioned . ''

		Chang K'ien travelled for seven days and nights up the yellow river discovering vine trees , and meeting all the animals of Chinese Mythology : the huge tortoises , the tiger , seven feet long and a thousand years old , quite white , ... the blue storks , sacred attendants of Seiobo , the Kwei or cassia tree of immortality , ten thousand feet high , the flaming fruits of which are more powerful than the peaches of
Seiobo	LOCATION	, conferring everlasting life to whoever eats them ; he saw the hare which lives in the moon , and the old man who binds lovers ' feet ; finally on the seventh night he noticed that there were no stars reflected in the waters .

		The following morning , near the sources he saw a woman dressed in silver cloth on which were embroidered figures of stars , and who was weaving the net of the Zodiac .

		He enquired what was her name and what was that place , but she only showed him her radiant shuttle , telling him to refer the matter to the astrologer on his return .

		This worthy told him that no doubt he had been as far as the star Chih Nu , the spinning maiden who , on the
seventh night of the seventh month	DATE	is allowed to cross over the milky way , to meet her lover ,
K'ien Niu	PERSON	, pass - ing over a bridge of magpies -LRB- some others say of red maple leaves -RRB- , and that in fact referring to his observa - tions , he had at that very same date noted a shooting star passing near Chih Nu .

		He had therefore travelled the whole length of the yellow river as far as the Milky way , which continues it into heaven , as decreed by Nu Kwa . ''

		Naturally , in a book composed of many detached items some are treated with much greater fulness than others .

		The abundant illustrations , chiefly of netsuke , sword guards , inro , and ivories , will be highly appreciated by all who have occasion to consult this very usefiil book , but it is a pity that so many of the colored plates should be given over to reproductions of unimportant prints by
Kuniyoshi	PERSON	when works by much greater artists were available .

		Signs op Religious Unrest .

		* The historian of the future , discussing civi - lized man of the twentieth century , will certainly record this period as one of transition .

		Whether we think of matters sociological or psychological , whether of the structure of society or the less tangible but no less important fabrics of the mind , no matter what we hope or wish , we can rest assured of one thing -- that there will be change .

		To those who love the old and fear the new , it often seems as if the end were near .

		Even the ardent radical can not resist an occa - sional sigh of regret , as the old landmarks , so familiar and once so well-beloved , slowly dis - appear .

		In religion , it is perhaps true that the majority of the old school do not see the advanc - ing tide .

		Religious faiths have always been attacked by the enemies of God ; is He not still able to defend them ?

		The point over - looked is , that the so-caUed enemies are them - selves representatives of the Almighty , and have , if they tell the truth , the latest advices from that quarter .

		That interest inreligion itseK has not departed , the vast flood of literature on that topic suffi - ciently proves .

		These books are not written , printed , and bound , merely to ornament the shelves of booksellers .

		Readers they must have , -- eager , numerous , perhaps not over - discriminating readers ; for , to tell the truth , many of the books are poor things .

		It is at first difficult to imderstand why the religious public seem to prefer an infinite variety of works of mediocre quality to a few of real excellence ; but perhaps it merely indicates a variety of tastes , and a desire to view matters from several different angles , -- and these , so far , are good signs .

		The authorship of the works is also significant .

		In these days of commercialism , we expect to see everything produced with an eye on the market-place ; but it must be said for our religious writers , from the wisest to the most absurd , that they are as a class obviously altruistic , bent upon flinging their message to a needy world .

		So much good - will can not go for naught .

		Three diverse works , now before us , have prompted these remarks .

1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 213 the re-birth of religion in a freer age , under the guidance of the intellect .

		This is his theology : '' God is to us the sum of the forces of the universe ; to men of old he came now and then , he is with us all the time .

		He is the ceaseless energy from whom all things proceed ; he makes the outgoings of the morning and evening to praise him ; he sorrows over withered grass and notes the fall of the sparrow ; he regards the complaint of the poor and his eyelids try the children of men ; to know him is eternal life , and to serve him perfect freedom ... Man can become man only by making himself one with God .

		And it is m the strength of his divinity that the man of the human ideal and the man of the social order is to preach his Gospel to all peoples and bring all nations into the obedience of the Faith . ''

		In another place we find this : '' Not only do we have in the new dogmatic the friend God of
Abraham	LOCATION	, and the righteous God of
Isaiah	LOCATION	, and the Father God of Jesus ; but we have also the
Infinite God of Copernicus	ORGANIZATION	and
Bruno	PERSON	, the law-making
Grod	PERSON	of
Kepler	PERSON	and
Newton	LOCATION	, and the working God of Darwin ... The God of Darwin ... is the God who does things , the God who experiments , who is not afraid to soil his hands in the clay . ''

		Various elements of the old dogma , such as those of exclusive salvation and of hell , are not merely discarded , but are vigorously condemned as immoral .

		The author is as sure of his ground as he is earnest and courageous , and we can not otherwise than wish him well ; but at several points we find ourselves asking whether we are not escaping from one crassness to fall into another .

		The Catholics , with all their faults , have a certain justification for their institution of the confessional .

		Our God , if he is truly ours , must of necessity stand for something else than the noise and flurry of the outside world .

		In a philosophical sense , he may be everywhere ; but for practical purposes he comes in through a small door in our most private room , and we see him alone . ''

		The Christ That is to Be '' is an attempt to formulate the real gospel of Jesus , and to con - sider how it may be applied to the modern world .

		The author 's sympathies are largely with the past , and at the same time his keen interest is in developing for the future such fruits of the past travail of mankind as may prove most useful .

		He would not break with the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, for that has held the thread of Christian thought along the ages ; but he would see the
Church	ORGANIZATION	develop in the spirit of Jesus to meet new needs .

		Perhaps the following pas - sage is as eloquent of the writer 's attitude as anything in the book : `` We have certainly made progress in knowledge .

		Everyone who believes that good lies at the heart of things must believe that this progress is real and , even if chequered , will be continuous .

		At the same time we know that at the begiiming and at the end of every known sequence of fact or thought lies the unknown .

		DiflPerent epochs produce different theories with regard to the borderlands of knowledge ; farther off there is not even theory to support thought .

		It is only those who lack the power to learn from history who think that the tendency of thought for one age , although pointing for some time in one direction , necessarily points to finahty .

		Our progress is rather to be observed in the ceaseless shifting of opposing races and schools .

		The progress of our knowledge is like an apocalyptic ' vision ; always , everywhere , we have doctrine warring against doctrine and theory against theory , men 's hearts failing them because the very foundations of their thought are shaken .

		In the gloom of each conflict , to some God seems gone from heaven ; the periodic pulse of things , by which order is held out of chaos , beats low , and parts of knowledge that seemed as steadfast as the stars in the firmament are lost .

		That which emerges out of the din and darkness is the wiser man , not with higher powers but with wider opportunity .

		He knows that if he goes backward he fails .

		He must press for - ward ; yet , as he goes , something in the creeds that he thinks to be dead rises and meets him after many days , like a child advancing from the dawn of the morning '' -LRB- pp. 195-196 -RRB- .

		Professer Bousset , of
the University of Gottingen	ORGANIZATION	, has much in common with the writer of '' The Christ That is to Be . ''

		He also would test modern Christianity by the teachings of Jesus , and would ally himself with the com - munities which hold the thread of Christian tradition .

		At the same time , he does not shrink from the consequences of modern thought .

		Thus , he says : '' We no longer hold the belief that Jesus was abso - lutely different from ourselves -- He heaven-born , we earth-born .

		Rather , we say that His figure is the noblest and the most perfect that has been granted to humanity on its long journey from the lower stage to the higher .

		He is the goal of our existence , the leader of our life , to whom no other leader is comparable '' -LRB- P - ^ ^ ^ -RRB- -

		^ jo ^ g author of `` Confessio Medici '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has put together a little volume of medico-philosophical essays that are as bright and good in their way as the spare-hour diversions of that famous
Edinburgh	LOCATION	author-physician whose pub - lished correspondence has recently revived his mem - ory , or even as the genial talk '' over the tea-cups '' of another doctor-essayist and poet still nearer and dearer to our hearts .

		But this other book-writing healer of the sick refuses to take himself in the least seriously as a man of letters ; he will not even let us know his name or anything about him , except that he is a practicer of medicine and the author of an earlier volume , `` The Young People . ''

		To the 214 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, earnest doctor anything like pride of authorship is a mere superfluity of vanity . ''

		The problem of lives exalted , or sunk , or messed away , knocks at his heart .

		Let other young men write lurid little books , and tear the veil from the obvious , and be proud of that achievement : what are they to him , who entertains daily , as a matter of course , both Hell and Heaven ? ''

		In reading these richly sug - gestive essays on '' Vocation , '' '' Hospital Life , '' `` The Discipline of Practice , '' `` The Spirit of Practice , '' '' Retirement , '' etc. , one is again incident - ' ally reminded of the great and increasing vogue , among those of psychological or philosophical bent , of that former professor of psychology and present teacher of pragmatism .

		Dr.
William James	PERSON	.

		The author of '' Confessio Medici '' is evidently one of his most appreciative readers : he calls him '' the wisest of her -LSB- i.e. psychology 's -RSB- servants , '' and likens him to
Socrates	PERSON	for simplicity of style .

		One piece of excellent advice that the essayist gives to young practitioners is a little hard to follow : he urges them to add to their professional equipment , at the out - set , a serious illness or surgical operation , or both , that they may the more sympathetically treat their future patients .

		One can not at will develop a malignant tumor or other life-threatening excres - cence ; but how would it do for every medical student , just before getting his diploma , to go to the hospital and be de-appendicized ?

		The operation is now fairly safe , and the vermiform appendix would certainly never be missed .

		Every page of the book , let us say in conclusion , is good reading , whether the reader be doctor or patient , or neither .

		The writer 's style wiU delight the connoisseur .

		We can - not refrain from giving a random illustrative frag - ment out of the essay on `` Hospital Life . ''

		The
London	LOCATION	hospitals , declares the author , `` ought to work together , abandon competition , break their distinctive idols , throw open their sacred groves , and pool their patients .

		That would be a new ver - sion of the story of
Bethesda	LOCATION	: and the waters of that pool would indeed be troubled . ''

		The ubiquitous ^ he art of preventive medicine owes and nefarious much of its success in recent years Mosquito .

		t ^ tjje patient work of naturalists who have unravelled the secrets of the habits and life-histories of those insects which have become notorious as transmitters of disease to mankind .

		Of all the offenders of this ilk , none has more to account for than the ubiquitous mosquito .

		His name , more - over , is legion ; or , in more exact phrase , there are nearly a hundred known species in the
United States	LOCATION	which Miss
Evelyn Groesbeeck Mitchell	PERSON	re - cords in her treatise on '' Mosquito Life '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		This author 's book is based upon the extensive observations of the late Dr.
J. W. Dupree	PERSON	, the physician-natm ` alist of
New Orleans	LOCATION	.

		Miss
Mitchell	PERSON	was engaged as artist-entomologist in making the illustrations for a work upon this subject which Dr.
Dupree	PERSON	had in preparation at the time of his death .

		She has completed the work , and included in it some of her own later studies made while com - pleting a monograph on the group for the
Carnegie	ORGANIZATION	Institution of
Washington	LOCATION	.

		The book is replete with information concerning the mosquitoes of the
United States	LOCATION	, especially those of
New York	LOCATION	,
New Jersey	LOCATION	, and
Louisiana	LOCATION	.

		The anatomy of the adults , larvae , and pupae is described , and an illuminating account of their habits , flight , and breeding-places is given in detail .

		The relation of mosquitoes to malaria , yellow fever , elephantiasis , and other diseases , is treated in a popular way , and a description of the means of control of these pests is supplemented with an account of their principal enemies .

		The most original material in the book is to be found in the notes on the common species of this country , which constitute a considerable portion of the book , and are amply illustrated .

		There is an excellent chapter on laboratory methods , which will be useful to teachers of nature-study classes ; while the keys for the identification of adults , eggs , larvae , and pupae will be of service to all who study mosquitoes .

		The drawings would have been more useful if magnifica - tions had been given , and more acceptable from a technical point of view if more contrast had been employed , and if the direction of lighting had been consistently used , at least in contiguous drawings .

		Almost immediately upon the death The new view of , „ ^ , .

		i • lorn i , - i , the personality oi
Wordsworth	LOCATION	, in looO , biographers of
Wordsworth	LOCATION	.

		^ ^ ^ themselves at work to give some account of his life and personality .

		They strolled through the
Lake Country	LOCATION	and collected a large amount of anecdotes and traditions from those who remembered him , especially from his neighbors among the yeomen and peasants .

		To them Words - worth had seemed a queer , uncanny , half-daft old man , who went muttering and '' booing '' about the country , reciting and composing verses that to them were naturally imintelligible .

		A prosaic world , being ever ready to depreciate what it does not comprehend , accepted the rustic estimate , and created an image of a solitary , self-absorbed , rather repellant personality , with affections so dormant as to be scarcely human .

		Even those who loved
Wordsworth	PERSON	's verse felt some need to apologize for his unloveliness as a man .

		In the present genera - tion , however , a truer and saner way of reconstruct - ing
Wordsworth	PERSON	's personality has been adopted .

		Instead of inquiring of persons who knew only his exterior , who were incapable of understanding his real nature , his later biographers have searched among family letters and the records of his more cultured acquaintances and friends for contemporary evidence of that '' best portion of a good man 's life , his little , nameless , unremembered acts of kindness and of love . ''

		Now , at last , we realize that
Wordsworth	PERSON	was a man of a warm and affectionate heart , the cordial host of an uncommonly hospitable home , the acknowledged centre of a devoted circle of friends , a gracious personality of whom we can scarcely hear too much .

		One of the latest and best of this class of biographers is Mr.
David Watson	PERSON	1908 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 215 Bannie , the author of ``
Wordsworth	PERSON	and his Circle '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		Delightful indeed is the com - pany in which we here find ourselves , -- for this circle includes not only near neighbors of
Wordsworth	LOCATION	, like
Southey	PERSON	and
Samuel Clarkson	PERSON	, but a long list of others like De Quincey ,
Scott	PERSON	,
Coleridge	PERSON	, and Lamb , who for longer or shorter periods came to the region , drawn by the charm of
Wordsworth	PERSON	's person - ality as well as of his poetry .

		Not the least original and brilliant chapter of this book is the one devoted to
Wordsworth	PERSON	's '' Fellow - Workers in Romanticism '' --
Byron	PERSON	,
Keats	PERSON	, and especially
Shelley	PERSON	.

		The author takes '' Alastor '' and the '' Hymn to Intellectual Beauty '' and sets them by the side of '' The Prelude '' and `` Tintern Abbey , '' to prove that both authors felt much the same need and supplied it in much the same way .

		Yet fancy the consternation of both , if either had been compared with the other in his own lifetime !

		The latest word in Botany .

		Dr.
C. C. Curtis	PERSON	, of
Columbia Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity , presents a pleasant summary of modern botany , in his volume entitled `` The Nature and Development of Plants '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- .

		For once , we have a book about science and scientific research which is withal not a text - book , has no reference to laboratory or class-room , but is simply a book to be read or consulted as occa - sion or inclination may suggest .

		While the story is , of course , in its broader outlines old and to some ex - tent familiar , nevertheless we have on almost every page sentences that represent the latest phases of theory and research .

		The first section of the vol - ume dealing with the nature of plants is in this regard especially to be commended .

		The author , meanwhile avoiding the more technical sides of his subject , carries his argument forward in a style so clear and simple that the most inexperienced reader may easily foUow the fascinating story .

		In these restless days , nearly every book of science is old almost before it leaves the binder .

		Possibly antici - pating such a possibility , our author presents some conclusions which present knowledge does not en - tirely justify .

		For instance , few botanists would be inclined to rank transpiration as a leaf-function comparable to photosynthesis .

		Again , while bacteria are no doubt causally related to several forms of infectious disease , it is by no means equally certain that certain other diseases , specifically small-pox and hydrophobia , '' are due to a low order of microscopic animal life . ''

		The organism to be associated with small-pox is yet to be discovered .

		The volume is handsomely printed , and abounds in carefully-drawn and in most cases original illustrations .

		Small 's treatise on ''
Adam Smith	PERSON	and Modern Sociology '' -LRB-
University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		To those who have been accustomed to regard '' The Wealth of Nations '' as a brilliant if somewhat provincial study in pure economics , or , on account of its `` labor-cost theory , '' as a possible point of departure for Marxian socialism , it will be a mental leap to Professor Small 's contention that the famous work should be studied only in its correlation to sociology .


Adam Smith	PERSON	's `` Theory of Moral Sen - timents , '' says Professor Small , is an attempt to state life in large moral terms , from which '' The Wealth of Nations '' is merely a technological excursus .

		It is a treatise entirely responsible to a moral philos - ophy which takes into account all human activities .


Adam Smith	PERSON	, however , in spite of his admirable concreteness , inconsistently used in his reasoning both the inductive and deductive methods ; and occa - sionally his conclusions were obscured .

		The result was that his successors fell from his high level of thought , where his broad vision comprehended the relation between economic and sociological thinking , and economics developed as a science of things independent of human relations .

		To repair this divergence , as he believes it to be , Professor Small presents his study in `` Sociological Methodology , '' and analyzes in some detail `` The Wealth of Nations , '' showing where its author is strictly technological and where he touches upon '' the larger science of soci - ology . ''

		With this new light turned on the subject , old students of
Adam Smith	PERSON	will find fresh food for reflection , and those unacquainted with the great scholar will be fortunate in approaching him through Professor Small 's scholarly and philosophical intro - duction .

		A Bishop of
Richard Hooker Wilmer	PERSON	,
Second t?ie Southern Bishop of Alabama	ORGANIZATION	, occupied a Confederacy .

		unique position in the
American Episcopate	ORGANIZATION	.

		He was the only Bishop consecrated in the
Protestant Episcopal Church	ORGANIZATION	in the Confed - erate States of
America	LOCATION	, which in the years 1861-5 maintained an organization separate and distinct from the
Protestant Episcopal Church	ORGANIZATION	in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Having followed the fortunes of the
Southern Confederacy	LOCATION	, he and his clergy were , at the close of the Civil War , under
General Orders No. 38	ORGANIZATION	, for - bidden by the Federal military authority to preach or perform divine service until they should '' give evidence of a patriotic spirit , by offering to resume the use of the prayer for the President of the
United States	LOCATION	and all in civil authority . ''

		So he was `` the man upon whom , in the providence of God , it de - volved to make the fight in these
United States	LOCATION	for the independence and supremacy of the Church in things spiritual . ''

		Hence the life of this man , which closed
Jime 14 , 1900	DATE	, in the eighty-fifth year of his age , is of far wider than diocesan interest .

		It is a contribution to the history of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	and of the country .

		The Bishop will perhaps be best remem - bered , among those who knew him , for his quickness at repartee and his incisive humor -- his '' naturally destructive wit , '' which , happily , he held under restraint , and bent '' not to self-pleasing , but to the advancement of the cause of Christ . ''

		These quali - ties should serve to make his biography unusually readable .

		Fortunately , the Reverend
Walter	PERSON	C. 216 THE DIAL -LSB-

Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is at once a beautiful and a readable volume .

		Mr.
Munro	PERSON	pro- tests strongly against the popular misconception of the great Scottish river , which ignores all its claims to romantic beauty and regards it as a mere '' drudge of commerce , '' -- the '' scullery maid of
Glasgow	LOCATION	. ''

		The
Clyde	PERSON	, he explains , is like the Thames in being not one river but three , -- mountain stream , turgid river of commerce , and splendid island-dotted firth .

		It is manifestly unfair to disregard everything but the '' prosaic and squalid interlude '' of mile-long docks and vast ship-yards , where all the navies of the world come and go .

		Even this part of the
Clyde	PERSON	is not without charm for Mr.
Munro	PERSON	, though he admits that the time to see it is at night .

		But above
Glasgow	LOCATION	anyone must acknowledge the love - liness of the Lowland scenery ; and the grandeur of the
Firth of Clyde	ORGANIZATION	is also beyond dispute .

		Like all the rest of
Scotland	LOCATION	,
Clydesdale	ORGANIZATION	is rich in legend and ballad-lore , much of which Mr.

		There are also special chapters on
Glasgow	LOCATION	,
Lennox	PERSON	, and
Greenock	PERSON	.

		The artists , on the other hand , keep rather strictly to the river and the firth , showing them , however , in many phases of beauty and picturesque grandeur .

		Between pic - tures and text we are fully convinced that Mr.
Munro	PERSON	is not far wrong in calling the Clyde '' the most astonishing , beautiful , and inspiring of Scottish water-ways . ''

		Although they deal with the observations and experiments of a naturalist in English woods and fields , they are of interest to American readers , not only because of the pains - tJiking care with which the author has gathered his facts and his illustrations , and the pleasing manner in which he has related them , but also because of the fact that some of the chapters -- for example , that on the life-study of the jelly-fish , the ones recording the revelations which the microscope makes of opening buds and falling leaves and the interesting shells of the lowest forms of life , and the story of a piece of coal -- have no limitations of locality to circumscribe their interest .

		Even the beautifully illustrated chapter giving the life-histories of various English butterflies , in word and picture , from the egg to the adult , is not without value to those who wish to follow in like sequence the history of our American insects .

Lobingier	PERSON	traces the growth of the popular demand for opportunity to act directly in civic affairs without intervention of delegates or middlemen .

		Two German texts published by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the following : `` Das
Fraulein von Scuderi	PERSON	, '' by
E. T. A. Hoffmann	PERSON	, edited by Professor
Gustav Gruener	PERSON	; and '' Die beiden Freunde , '' a tale by Count
Heknuth von Moltke	PERSON	, edited by Dr.
Karl Detlev Jessen	PERSON	.

		From
Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co.	ORGANIZATION	we have
Riehl	PERSON	's `` Burg Neidek , '' edited by Professor J. B ,
E. Jones	PERSON	; and
Heine	PERSON	's '' Die Harzreise , '' edited by Professor
B. J. Vos	PERSON	.

		The ''
Turk	PERSON	's Head Edition '' of
Oliver Goldsmith	PERSON	's works , which Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	's Sons will publish this
Spring	DATE	in ten octavo volumes , will present
Goldsmith	PERSON	in complete and trustworthy text , based upon
Peter Cimningham	PERSON	's edition .

		Mr.
Horatio Sheafe Krans	PERSON	has provided a biographical and critical introduction , and there will be eighty full-page illustrations in photo - g ^ vure from original designs by Mr.
Frederick Simpson Cobum	PERSON	.

		Almost simultaneously with the publication of the English version of
Carl Ewald	PERSON	's novel , '' The Old Room , '' comes the news of the death of the distinguished Danish author .

		Ewald is best known to American readers by '' Two Legs , '' one of a long series of whimsical fairy - tales , and '' My Little Boy , '' a perfect idyl of childhood , full of subtle psychology and mystical charm .

		In his own land
Ewald	ORGANIZATION	's work has long been thoroughly appre - ciated , and it is well known in other countries of
Europe	LOCATION	,
America	LOCATION	having been rather behind hand in recognizing his delightful originality .

		During the present year Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	's Sons will publish a new single-volume '' Dictionary of the Bible , '' edited by Dr.
James Hastings	PERSON	, whose five-volume dic - tionary is recogfnized as the leading work of its kind .

		Every article has been specially written for this work , which is not in any sense an abridgement of the larger one .

		The authors have been chosen with as much care as the authors of the large dictionary , and with more experience ; so that the average of scholarship will be , if anything , higher .

		Of foremost interest among the latest issues in Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	's excellent series of '' World 's Classics '' is the volume of
Cowper	PERSON	's letters , to which Mr.
E. V. Lucas	PERSON	contributes a pleasant introduction .

		Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	also edits
Jane Austen	PERSON	's ''
Emma	PERSON	'' ; and Mr.
Austin Dobson	PERSON	performs a similar office for
Reynolds	PERSON	's '' Dis - courses . ''

		Besides these , there are the fifth and sixth volume of
Edmund Burke	PERSON	's writings , completing the set ; and the second volume of
Browning	PERSON	's poems .

		The first volume of the new edition of the '' Dictionary of National Biography '' has just been published simul - taneously in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	-LRB-
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		being the American publishers -RRB- , and it is promised that a new volume will appear each month until the twenty - two volumes are out .

		The original edition was in sixty - six volumes , and was pubUshed at more than three times the price of the present edition .

		Furthermore , the new edition has been corrected and some of the bibliographies have been revised , so that it is really preferable , both on account of accuracy and the amount of shelf-room required , to the original issue .

		Two books announced for early
spring	DATE	publication by
Messrs. George W. Jacobs & Co.	ORGANIZATION	should be of especial importance to the student of archaeology and to the general reader interested in this subject .

		One is entitled '' Archaeology and False Antiquities , '' and recounts some of the attempts made to palm off forged antiquities upon the unsuspecting relic hunter .

		The second book , '' Celtic Art in Pagan and Christian Times , '' deals with the vari - ous manifestations of the art of the Celt , as revealed in architectural construction and applied design , before the Anglo-Saxon set foot on British soil .

		`` The Bibliophile '' is the title of a new monthly '' magazine and review for the collector , .

		student , and general reader '' just projected in
London	LOCATION	.

		A strong array of contributors is presented in the first number , including Mr.
G. K. Chesterton	PERSON	, Mrs.
Arthur Bell	PERSON	, and Dr.
A. W. Pollard	PERSON	; and there are numerous illustra - tions , including several in color .

		It is a pity that this first number should be marred throughout by wretched proof-reading ; as the class to which the magazine makes its especial appeal is , or should be , the most exacting on such points .

		But notvvnthstanding this defect , '' The Bibliophile '' should have a cordial welcome from every book-collector .


Edmondo de Amicis	PERSON	, who died last month at
Bardig	LOCATION	- hera in
Italy	LOCATION	, was one of the most widely read among Italian authors , both in and out of his own coimtry .

		His education was military , and his first book , published in
1869	DATE	, before he had retired from active service , was a volume of short stories of army life .

		The instant success achieved by these sketches seemed to warrant the gratification of the young author 's taste for litera - ture and for travel .

		He journeyed to many lands and recorded his impressions so charmingly , -- with the same delicate understanding and quick sympathy that had distinguished his first effort , -- that his travel 218 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, sketches speedily became text-books in many different languages .

		Half a dozen stories , also , followed his first , and were very popular .

		His later years have been given over to the study of educational and economic questions , and his recent works indicate a decided lean - ing towards socialism .

		The only
Spring	ORGANIZATION	publication from
Messrs. Houghton	LOCATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's department of
Riverside Press Editions	ORGANIZATION	will be a '' Bibliography of
Ralph Waldo Emerson	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
George WiUis Cooke	PERSON	.

		The Press now has in hand two large undertakings : an augmented English edition of
Bernard	PERSON	's Life of the great Renaissance designer and printer , Greofroy Tory , elaborately and profusely illus - trated ; and a sumptuous folio edition of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's '' Divina Commedia , '' to contain both the complete Italian text and Professor
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	's prose translation , and to be embellished with drawings from the rare designs of
Botticelli	ORGANIZATION	.

		The '' Geofroy Tory '' will be published in the
Autumn of 1908	DATE	, and one or two other small books of interest may be expected about the same time .

		It is hoped that the
Dante	PERSON	will be ready for pub - lication in
1910	DATE	.

		Announcement of what Messrs.
Houghton	PERSON	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	characterize as their most important publication in several years has just been made .

		This is a large-paper edition , in twenty-five volumes , of the complete writings of George EUot , prepared upon a new plan with many unique features . ''

		The underlying principle is that the reader 's enjoyment will be increased a hundredfold if he knows the author intimately .

		The edition therefore will be fully equipped with the material necessary to such an acquaintance .

		All of the author 's earlier books were based to a large extent upon real scenes and char - acters , but the facts have not been generally known .

		By sending a special representative to visit these scenes and make personal investigations , a large amount of new and interesting information has been obtained , resulting in a collection of photographs of the scenes that were in the author 's mind when she wrote these novels .

		It was learned that many of the characters were taken from life , and portraits of many of these persons were obtained All these photographs are made valuable to the reader by a series of explanatory notes on the illus - trations .

		The edition will contain the best collection of portraits of
George Eliot	ORGANIZATION	ever brought together .

		There will be also two interesting portraits of Mr.
Lewes	PERSON	, and photographs of the birthplace of
George Eliot	LOCATION	,
Griff House	ORGANIZATION	where she spent her girlhood , the various schools which she attended , and the different homes of her later life .

		In the volumes where the author does not write of real scenes the illustrations are by distinguished English artists , including Mr.
Charles E. Brock	PERSON	, Mr.
Fred Pegram	PERSON	, Mr.
H. M. Paget	PERSON	, Mr.
A. S. Hartrick	PERSON	, and Mr.
Ambrose Dudley	PERSON	, besides reproductions of some charming water-colors by Mrs.
Patty Townsend Johnson	PERSON	, who was living in the
George Eliot	ORGANIZATION	country at the time the novels first appeared .

		Introductions have been prepared for all the different novels setting forth in detail the circumstances under which they were written and all the information which the reader should have to appreciate fully their purpose .

		Mr.
Cross	PERSON	's biography , made up very largely from the author 's own journals and letters , will be included to give the reader a still more intimate acquaintance .

		One entire volume of the edition will be devoted to material written by
George Eliot	PERSON	but never before published in a collected edition .

		The text will be printed from plates especially made for this edition from entirely new type . ''

		BRIEFER MENTION 250 NOTES 251 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 252 EXAGGERATION AND THE ARTISTIC -LSB- TEMP ERAM ENT .

		The century is young ; the world also is young , as worlds go ; and our country , compared with many , is very young .

		Exaggeration is one of the faults to which youth is peculiarly subject -- and from which age is not wholly free .

		To be an artist -- in words , in color , with the chisel , on the stage , or in whatever medium -- and not to exaggerate , sometimes and to some extent , might fairly be considered an impossibility .

		With the example of the Supreme Artist -LRB- personified or not -RRB- constantly before one 's eyes , how could it be otherwise ?

		For who will claim that the universe exhibits an exact adaptation of means to ends , with no waste ?

		What an infinitesimal fraction of the sun 's energy serves any known or conceivable end , compared with the vast amount of heat radiated each second into infinite space !

		Why should the maple tree produce ten thousand seeds a year when one seed in ten years would more than perpetuate its kind ?

		Of course the naturalist 's explanation is obvious enough ; but the truth remains that nature is the very type and example of exaggeration , of a lavish exuberance that is the very opposite of restraint and reserve .

		In a sort of frolic superabimdance of vital energy not even the superlatives of the up-to - date journalist can vie with her .

		But this is not saying that hyperbole is a good thing in itself , or that the easy art of exaggeration is one to be cultivated .

		Rather is exaggeration to be regarded as an evil , though a necessary one , and its restraint to be studied .

		It is one form of ani - mation , and animated restraint , as
Walter Bagehot	PERSON	long ago observed , is a most desirable quality in literary expression , as in art generally .

		What makes the judicious exaggerator grieve is the reckless waste with which his carefully husbanded reserves of strong and effective words and phrases are squandered by the unthinking and unscrupulous on subjects of trivial moment ; so that when the really great occurrence demands forceful description , the adequately descriptive terms are found to have been all worn threadbare .

		Funds that should have been accumulating against an earthquake , a pestilence , or a war , have been dribbling away in the purchase of daily bread .

		The reckless exaggerator is a spend - thrift ; unthinking resort to hyperbole is improvi - dence ; and the few wise and heedful pay for the misdoings of the many foolish .

		Arecent book on `` The Fortunes of the Republic , '' by a writer whose occupancy of a pulpit famous in our church history gives his utterances a weight and authority they might not otherwise possess , contains 232 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, this sentence in its preface : '' I have talked with thousands of men of all classes , and if one can trust one 's own eyes and ears , there is not the shadow of a shade of a reason for pessimism as to the people and institutions of this country . ''

		Taken literally , '' thousands '' means at least two thousand , and '' all classes '' admits of no exceptions .

		Each conversa - tion , too , if profitable for instruction , must have occupied at least ten minutes .

		But who will believe that this busy preacher and pastor , writer and lec - turer , has spent three or four hundred hours dis - cussing industrial and sociological questions with representatives of all classes , from the philanthropist to the pick-pocket , from the plutocrat to the pauper , and from the organizer of vast industries to the vender of peanuts ; and that not one of them all had any serious complaints or gloomy forebodings with which to cloud the author 's optimistic outlook ?

		And if the reader 's credulity is thus strained at the very start , what likelihood that the succeeding chapters of the book will carry conviction ?

		Surely the literary artist has here laid on his colors much too thickly .

		The phrase '' as easy as lying '' is no bad formula to indicate the extreme of facility .

		The tempta - tion to let a story lose nothing in the telling , but rather gain a great deal , is almost irresistible .

		It has been plausibly conjectured that the artistic temperament , the love of effective statement , in
Carlyle	LOCATION	and his wife , was responsible for all the wild rumors of acute inharmony between that inter - esting couple .

		Turning the pages of Mrs.
Carlyle	PERSON	's sprightly correspondence , without looking for pas - sages of conjugal endearment or the opposite , one soon chances on such highly-colored bits as the following vehement reference to a not very extrar ordinary incident connected with her pet dog Nero : '' As for
Nero	PERSON	, his temper is at all times that of an angel .

		But yesterday , O heavens !

		I made my first experience of the strange , suddenly-struck-solitary , altogether-ruined feeling of having lost one 's dog !

		and also of the phrensied feeling of recognising him , from a distance , in the arms of a dog-stealer !

		But mercifully it was near home that he was twitched up . ''

		And apropos of repairs going on in the house , she writes distressfully to her absent husband : '' For God ^ s sake do not let John plump in upon me in my present puddlement .

		There wants only him , or the like of him , constantly running out and in , inter - fering with everything and needing to be attended to , to make my discomfort complete .

		The bare idea of it makes me like to scream ! ''

		With
Carlyle	PERSON	him - self , in his unstinted use of picturesquely emphatic language , readers are familiar .

		Writing to his brother John , he calls
Ruskin	PERSON	, with humorous ex - aggeration of the latter 's qualities , '' a bottle of beautiful soda-water , '' and Macaulay he unduly depreciates in styling him , although '' a man of truly wonderful historical memory , '' yet '' in other respects constantly definable as the sublime of commonplace , not one of whose ideas has the least tincture of great - ness or originality or any kind of superior merit except neatness of expression ; valde mediocris homo . ''

		But it is in picturing his own woes and grievances that the artist 's delight in vivid expres - sion rises to its height in
Carlyle	LOCATION	.

		It is a question which gave him the greater satisfaction , toiling stren - uously and successfully at his '' Friedrich '' for eight busy years , or groaning and ejaculating , in forcible exclamations and adjectives and adverbs , over his herculean task .

		`` Ever since I wrote last year from Scotsbrig , '' he tells his brother John as the great book nears completion , '' I have been working like a slave ; day and night involved in confusions , of the most unmanageable nature ; -- the only limit not to break myself down altogether , in which case there would be no hope of the job .

		Never in my life had I a thing so difficult to do ; and I am fallen old , and feckless in comparison ; hope much dead in me ; not fit to handle such huge mountains of rubbish ; -- yet dreadfully unwilling to be beaten by them , too .

		Being withal in the most evident state of special Hi-health , worse than even naturally belongs to me at this age . ''

		A permissible comment on this artistry in words would be that the artist himself , with all his dyspeptic grumblings and growlings , .

		outlived his younger brothers and passed far beyond the three-score-and-seven years alloted to average mortality .

		Artistic emphasis of certain aspects or details is necessary in graphic art to differentiate it from the monotonous literalness of photography .

		The same judicious placing of emphasis is demanded in writ - ing , in order to convert dull and colorless narrative into literature .

		What is characteristic requires touching up , what is unessential must be properly toned down .

		In the things of every-day life , in matters of conduct and costume and personal appear - ance , it is a process instinctive even in the least aesthetically developed of the race .

		The thick - lipped South-African negro is prone to exaggerate this labial deformity -LRB- or beauty , as he regards it -RRB- by thrusting thorns through his lips to make them swell ; arid , already provided with an abundant crop of woolly hair , he masses it high on the top of his head to accentuate the effect .

		Many tribes , as the Malays , the
Kirghis	PERSON	, and the Hottentots , depress the already flat nose , sometimes even breaking down the bone ; whereas the thin-nosed Arab or Spaniard can never acquire too great aquilinity .

		American Indians , unblessed with beards , pull out the few chin hairs they may chance to have ; and hirsute Aino women paint the upper lip to make the mus - tache look heavier .

		The oblique eyes of Japanese belles are artificially made to appear even more oblique ; and the long , narrow eyes of Egyptian dames are likewise rendered longer and narrower in appearance than in reality .

		The fat women of
Uganda	LOCATION	assiduously cultivate obesity , and the lean ladies of
Java	LOCATION	eat clay to reduce themselves still further .

		Chinese women , having naturally small feet , pinch them to infantile proportions .

		And so on , to any length .

		Exaggeration , then , for purposes of aesthetic effect ^
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 233 is inevitable , and , within limits , desirable .

		It is the due observance of the limits , the attainment of that golden mean which is artistic emphasis and not vulgar extravagance , that marks the true artist , economical of his resources and never conveying the impression of having exhausted his reserve force .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		The problem of the publishers , which iu the end is the problem of all dealers in merchantable wares -- namely , how to sell their products so as to bring in the largest returns -- is discussed by Mr.
Merton H. Forrester	PERSON	in the current ''
Munsey	PERSON	's Magazine . ''

		The article is headed , '' What has Happened to the American Book - Publishers ? ''

		And the answer given is that they have failed to take the hint furnished by the conspicuous suc - cess of the ten-cent magazines .

		It is argued that if attractive and low-priced periodical literature attains so wide a circulation as it has in the last dozen years , the same circulation ought to be attainable by attractive and low-priced books .

		It is further pointed out that , to use the writer 's words , '' no one has yet done more than scratch the surface of the possible reading public , '' and that even a book that has a sale of six hundred thou - sand copies is bought by only three-tenths of one per cent of the population of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The argu - ment , as presented , is plausible ; but no account is taken of the fact that magazines live by their advertisements .

		Is there room in the advertising field , already so largely covered by the magazines and newspapers -- not to men - tion the bill-boards , the street cars , the sandwich men , and various other means of attaining publicity -- for books too ?

		We have groaned , but groaned patiently , imder the weight of the magazine 's advertising pages .

		Should we ever submit to a proportionate increase in the size and weight of our books ?

		The English experiment in half-crown novels has yet to be proved a success .

		The vast circulation of the so-called '' subterranean '' liter - ature , the sensational trash that the world of letters knows nothing about , is not mentioned by Mr.
Forrester	PERSON	, and hardly bears on the question under discussion , except to make a self-respecting author shudder at the thought of his poem or novel or essay depending , for its com - mercial success , on any such '' cheap and nasty '' style and methods .

		Perhaps Mr.
Seymour Eaton	PERSON	and his lately organized Thinkers ' Club will think out the cor - rect solution of this problem of the pubUshers .

		• ■ • Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	's additional gift of
five million dollars	MONEY	to the resources of the
Carnegie Foundation	ORGANIZATION	for the
Advancement of Teaching	ORGANIZATION	is to the educational world a matter of large importance .

		It assures the participation in the Foimdation upon equal terms of
State Universities	ORGANIZATION	and the Universities of private foundation .

		The tenta - tive exclusion of the
State Universities	ORGANIZATION	called forth no uncertain protest from those affiliated alike with private and state-supported institutions .

		The danger that Uni - versities were to be classed according to the source of their funds and not according to the ideals that deter - mined the manner of their expenditure was a very real one .

		Equally real was the danger that the two types of institution would be drawn into a rivalry spoken of as friendly in public conclave but hardly leading to friendly relations in the educational confessional .

		More - over , the fact that the division line between the two types of institution was partly geographical still further presented the possibilities of factional and sectional divi - sion ; while overshadowing these objections stood the fundamental disability that the
Foundation	ORGANIZATION	, the integrity of whose service depended upon its achieving a national status and influence , was thus likely to be a one-sided and limited influence .

		It was pretty broadly hinted that the Trustees , -- all chosen from private institutions , -- while presenting arguments to show the necessity of the Umitation of the
Foundation	ORGANIZATION	, were really acting upon the conviction that presently the fimds would not be sufficient to '' go round . ''

		To have the financial dis - ability completely removed certainly opens the way for a graceful retreat .

		It is in every way a consummation devoutly wished and devoutly welcomed .

		In The Dial of
May 16 , 1905	DATE	, the great educational importance of the institution which Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	has called into being has been duly set forth .

		It seems eminently desirable that additional influences should be set at work to dignify and secure the academic career in the land of the dollar ; and it is gratifying to record that dollars are to be used to bring some measure of security to the teaching profession in the higher institutions of learning throughout the length and breadth of the land .

		The
State	ORGANIZATION	is ever an uncertain compensator for services rendered ; and the argument of paternalism distresses legislatures .

		The inclusion of professors in state - supported institutions in this truly national foundation is only just , but of that type of justice more frequently conceded on paper than provided for in practice .

		Hence this tribute to Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	and the Trustees of the
Foundation	ORGANIZATION	.

		... The old and the new in librarianship have their respective claims to consideration , and the writer who has been discussing with Mr.
Briggs	PERSON	, our recent cor - respondent , the merits of the ancient system , and who fears that some of his own remarks have been mis - understood or have even caused pain , ventures to add a few explanatory and propitiatory comments .

		He says : '' There is really no cause for any disagreement between Mr.
Briggs	PERSON	and the present writer .

		The desirability of wider acquaintance with books on the part of librarians great and small is one of the leading points of the doctrine preached here from week to week .

		In admi - ration for the spirit of book-lover and book-knower which was a characteristic of the ' old-fashioned libra - rian , ' we will not yield a jot to anyone .

		If necessary , chapter and verse can be quoted to show that that creed has always been upheld in this pulpit .

		The little piece to which Mr.
Briggs	PERSON	seems to have objected was intended to point out that on the whole we have gained , even if certain desirable qualities have been lost , with the disappearance of the ' old-fashioned librarian . '

		Li - braries are popular and democratic where they formerly were exclusive and jealously guarded .

		Their faults are the faults of the age .

		At any rate , the discussion has had one gratifying point .

		Mr.
Briggs	PERSON	says that he has ' repeatedly read the passage quoted again by the Transcript regarding the curmudgeon of olden time who kept his books under rusty lock and key . '

		Now , the only thing ' quoted ' was from • The Old Librarian 's Almanac , ' so we are led to the belief that Mr.
Briggs	PERSON	is a reader of that fine old work .

		This is good news , indeed , and it is to be hoped that many others are fol - lowing this example .

		` The Old Librarian 's Almanac ' deserves to be better known by the present generation . ''

		234 THE DIAI .

		-LSB-
April 16	DATE	, French ignorance of things American sometimes reaches a pitch that is almost equivalent to contempt .

		But we need not take offense ; for the typical boulevardier is little better instructed in matters much nearer home .

		To him ,
Paris	LOCATION	is
France	LOCATION	, and what lies beyond is all terra incognita and does n't count .

		A delver into the archives of the French Academy has discovered some rather amusing evidences of an astonishing ignorance concerning so famous a man as
George Washington	LOCATION	.

		The Immortals did not even give him the title of '' general , '' and apparently he was associated indiscrim - inately with '' les officiers g ^ n ^ raux , le G ^ n ^ ral Gates et le G ^ n ^ ral Green . ''

		As for spelling his name with anything like correctness , that was not to be expected : the French dictionary-makers got as near to it aa `` M. Wastington , '' `` M. Wasinghton , '' and ''
Georgio Washinghon	PERSON	, '' and therewith remained content .

		If this was the best these learned gentlemen could do , what was to be expected of playwrights and actors in their attempts to exploit an illustrious name ?

		What could the French tongue make out of either W or sh f The climax was reached in
1785	DATE	, when there appeared on the stage a character designated as '' Vazington fils , '' a son of
George Washington	LOCATION	.

		In Sauvigny 's '' La Libertd du
Nouveau Monde	PERSON	, '' we find Vazington -LRB- p ` ere , not Jils , this time -RRB- declaiming the following heroic lines : '' J'ai rempli les devoirs d'un citoyen fid ^ e. Et si quelque succes a couronn6 mon z ^ e , Je le dois aux euerriers dont I ` h ^ roique ardeur De mes nobles travaux a partage I ` honneur . ''

		Could anything be less Washingtonian ?

		But certain other famous Americans fared little better .

		In the catalogue of the Salon for
1789	DATE	,
Houdon	PERSON	's bust of
Jefferson	LOCATION	is entered as ''
M. Sefferson	PERSON	, Envoyd des Etats de
Virginie	PERSON	. ''

		These and other entertaining matters of the same sort have been communicated to the
Boston	LOCATION	'' Transcript '' by Mr.
Howard P. Arnold	PERSON	, of
Pasadena	LOCATION	,
Cal	LOCATION	.

		A self-contradictory characterization of American literary style appears in the
March	DATE	`` Blackwood , '' from the sprightly pen of Mr.
Charles Whibley	PERSON	, who takes such delight in describing his late visit to this country .

		In his paper on '' American Lit - erature '' he declares that '' the writers of
America	LOCATION	have lagged honourably behind their age .

		The wisest of them have written with a studious care and quiet rev - erence . '' ''

		The new world , to its honour be it said , has discovered no new art of letters .

		The land , where all else is characteristic , has made few attempts to impose its character upon the literary language . ''

		But after thus praising our men of letters for their faithful fol - lowing of the old English models , he says , a few pages further on : '' The whole continent is pegged out in well-acknowledged claims .

		Boston cultivates one style ,
Chicago	LOCATION	another .

		Each corner makes the most of its own material , and cheerfully discovers to the other States its character and temperament .

		The result is of great and varied interest . ''

		Chicago he singles out for such peculiar praise as must be quoted here . ''

		That admirable literature should come from
Chicago	LOCATION	, '' he writes , '' is of itself a paradox .

		It is still more sur - prising that the best writers of
Chicago	LOCATION	should display the qualities of tranquillity and reticence , which you would expect least of all to find in that monstrous city .

		Yet it is characteristic of Miss
Edith Wyatt	PERSON	and Mr.
H. B. Fuller	PERSON	, who have painted the manners of
Chicago	LOCATION	with the greatest skill , that they never force the note .

		They look upon their fellow-citizens with an amiable sympathy ; they describe them with quiet humour . ''

		Mr.
Whibley	PERSON	's article should be read in full , even if one can not take it all as gospel truth .

		• • • A NEW Shakespeare memorial for
London	LOCATION	has at last been definitely projected .

		Naturally it is to take the form of a statue .

		An able committee , which includes the President of the
Royal Academy	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Sidney Colvin	PERSON	, and Professor
Gollancz	PERSON	, has chosen a fine site in Park Crescent , and secured
King Edward	ORGANIZATION	's con - sent to the transference of the statue of the
Duke of Kent	ORGANIZATION	now standing there to another position .

		It is proposed that the new statue shall be a world 's tribute to the poet , and accordingly all civilized nations are to be invited to join the
British Empire	ORGANIZATION	and
America	LOCATION	in the erection of a worthy memorial .

		Meanwhile the annual Shakespeare festival , in memory of the poet 's birthday , is to come off as usual this month , imder the capable and Iqving direction of Mr.
F. R. Benson	PERSON	.

		The theatrical performances will continue nightly for three weeks from
April 20	DATE	, and on
April 30	DATE	there will be a Shakespearean costume ball in the town hall at
Stratford	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Forbes Robertson	PERSON	as
Hamlet	LOCATION	, Mr.
Lewis Waller	PERSON	as
Henry V.	PERSON	, Mr.
Henry Ainley	PERSON	as
Romeo	LOCATION	,
Miss Genevieve Ward	PERSON	as Queen
Margaret	PERSON	in ''
Richard III.	PERSON	, '' and Mr.
Poel	PERSON	and the
Elizabethan Stage Society	ORGANIZATION	in `` Measure for Measure , '' are among those who will assist Mr.
Benson	PERSON	and his always thoroughly trust - worthy company in the Shakespearean productions .

		Such a memorial as the Shakespeare festivals may be less lasting than monuments of marble or bronze , but it is certainly quite as strongly marked by the spirit of true remembrance .

		... A VETERAN librarian 's RETIREMENT that will attract attention abroad as well as at home , and that will be deeply regretted by the community he has so long and so acceptably served , is that of Mr.
Samuel Swett Green	PERSON	, for thirty-seven years head of the
Worcester	LOCATION	-LRB-
Mass.	LOCATION	-RRB- Public Library , of which he became a trustee forty-one years ago for a term of four years .

		Native of
Worcester	LOCATION	, his home-keeping has brilliantly contradicted the Shakespearean adage : his many honors and offices , and his many services to the cause of culture , have demonstrated his wits to be by no means '' homely . ''

		Already known to the world of literature , he asks to be relieved of his library duties in order that he may devote himself to still further literary work ; but it is probable that his successor will not be appointed before next year .

		Worthy of passing note is the fact that under Mr.
Green	PERSON	's administration the
Worcester	LOCATION	library was the first in
New England	LOCATION	to open its doors on
Sunday	DATE	, and also -LRB- so rumor declares -RRB- the first in the world to allow the renewal of books by telephone .

		Other useful innovations are credited to him , and he has always shown himself re - sponsive to suggestions and a vigUant foe to that lifeless routine into which librarians have been known to settle in somnolent content .

		... Shakespeare on a merry-go-round would be a ciu-ious spectacle to us , but probably not more so , nor so much so , as would have been to him the sight of his plays as now presented in
Berlin	LOCATION	on the Reinhardt Revolving Stage , or Drehbuhne , whereby the scenes can all be expeditiously rendered in the original order and without the customary waits for scene-shifting and stage - setting .

		A spectator of these
Reinhardt	PERSON	productions at the Deutsches Theater says , among other interesting things : '' It may seem trivial to lay such stress upon
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 235 technique , but in
Shakespeare	LOCATION	, as in all the masters of dramatic art , the form is an expression and a part of the idea .

		The Deutsches Theater , presenting the play in its entirety , has manifested the structure of ' Twelfth Night ' as I have never seen it revealed before .

		The untangling of the plot in the last act , in particular , one of the consummate masterpieces of dramatic technique , stands out in wonderful relief .

		It moved me deeply in the beautiful production by Mr.
Sothern	PERSON	and
Miss Marlowe	PERSON	, but if I compare my two impressions I see that then I was stirred by Shakespeare alone , while
Herr Reinhardt	PERSON	supports the dramatist to the full with the subtle art of the stage manager .

		He has prepared for the untangling , moreover , by bringing out what I have never seen shown on the stage before , the tangling of the plot in the third act . ''

		We shall soon have
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	served up in styles to suit all tastes -- from the studied simplicity of the Ben Greet Players to the elaborate perfection of the
Reinhardt Revolving Stage	ORGANIZATION	.

		• • • A EivAL TO Sir
Boyle Roche	PERSON	, in the matter of bulls , has been discovered in an editor quoted -LRB- or reported to have been quoted -RRB- at a dinner party by Mr.
Edwin Markham	PERSON	. ''

		When I was teaching in
Los Angeles	LOCATION	, '' are Mr.
Markham	PERSON	's alleged words , '' I used to read every week a little country paper whose editor 's meta - phors were an unfailing joy to me . ''

		Three examples of marvellously mixed metaphors are then cited .

		First , concerning a contemporary whose truthfulness was questioned by the editor : '' Thus the black lie , issuing from his base throat , becomes a boomerang in his hand , and , hoisting him by his own petard , leaves him a marked man for life . '

		Next , in an article on home life : '' The faithful watchdog or his good wife , standing at the door , welcomes the master home with an honest bark . ''

		And finally , in a notice of a farmer 's death : `` The race was run at last .

		Like a tired steed he crossed the harbor bar , and , casting aside whip and spur , lay down upon that bourne from which no traveller returns . ''

		The smile that these examples , if they are not too outrageous , may elicit , would be called forth a himdred times a day if one stopped to take thought of the original meaning of the separate words in scores of phrases that have become , by use and convention , as little noticeable for incongruity as , for instance , the shining cylinder adorning the head of a man of fashion , or the flapping skirts that make walking a weariness to women .

		We all mix our metaphors as unavoidably as we all observe , to some extent at least , senseless conventions .

		• • • The pine tree poetry of
Japan	LOCATION	has received some very considerable additions in the last few months .

		At the recent time-honored festival of '' the Reading of Poems , '' held annually in the presence of the Japanese Emperor and
Empress	ORGANIZATION	, the subject set was '' Shato no
Matsu	LOCATION	, '' or `` The Pine Tree before the
Temple Ground	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Competing for the honor of being read in the
august	DATE	presence , some thirty thousand poems were sent in , says a writer in '' The
Japan	LOCATION	Times . ''

		The pine tree seems to hold in
Japan	LOCATION	much the same place as the oak in
England	LOCATION	The cherry blossom is , of course , the national flower ; but , says a native writer , '' we have not only the quick beauty of the cherry blossom , whose pride is in its falling without complaint .

		There is a beauty which is feminine ; and also manly beauty .

		I am rather sus - picious that the cherry blossom belongs to the former sort of beauty ; and I believe that there must be some other tree to represent our manliness and strength ; I find the national ideal in the pine tree .

		Look at the pine tree , which will give you a divine suggestion if you see it keeping at a distance , and again inspire you with its strength if you are near to it ; now it will appear to you as a man of powers and command , now as a prophet who scorns the world and dust ... There is no other tree like the pine in expressing such manliness and nobility . ''

		This , and more in similar strain , is calculated to appeal to anyone who has ever listened to the
summer	DATE	breeze whispering in the pine-tops , or heard the blast of winter smite '' his thimder-harp of pines . ''

		But there is another avenue of appeal not noticed by this Japanese writer : the wholesome fragrance of the pine is not to be left out of account .

		Are there any associations more vivid than those connected with the sense of smell ?

		• • • The
Johnson	PERSON	bicentenary is close upon us , and re - newed appeal comes from the
Mayor of Lichfield	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- Mr.
W. R. Coleridge-Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- for contributions to complete the restoration of the lexicographer 's birthplace , which is now set apart as a
Johnson Library	ORGANIZATION	and Museum .

		The old bookshop -LRB- of Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	's father -RRB- on the ground floor has been restored as nearly as possible to its original state , the modern shop front having been replaced by a double window in eighteenth-century style .

		`` The ancient floor has been made secure , '' we are informed , '' the old oak beams of the ceiling have been thrown open to view , and other work has been done to restore the shop to the state in which it existed in the olden days .

		We are now anxious , '' continues the Mayor , '' to proceed with the Birth-room above the shop , to reveal the oak panelling , and to make manifest the other features of interest which prevailed when Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	was born .

		Other rooms , and the roof , require renovation and reparation ... We wish to maintain the building as a memorial of the great and good man born there , and to hand it on to future generations of the English-speaking race . ''

		• • • The ethics of '' skipping '' might move to long and tiresome argument , for and against .

		Does the habit of skipping , even judicious skipping , if acquired early , tend to superficiality and lack of thoroughness ?

		Or does it promote intellectual independence and train the judg - ment ?

		With what an outburst of contempt Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	retorted on a questioner who had asked him , in regard to a certain book , whether he had read it through .

		`` No , '' thundered
Johnson	PERSON	; `` do you , sir , ever read a book through ? ''

		A decidedly Johnsonian position is taken by Mr.
Henry R. Tedder	PERSON	, Secretary and Librarian of the Athenaeum , in his paper on '' The Librarian in Relation to Books , '' read before the
Library Association	ORGANIZATION	at
Glasgow	LOCATION	, and now published by a
London	LOCATION	house . ''

		Most young people , '' he says , '' are disgusted at the very threshold of life by being told that they must read all books through .

		Nothing is more ridicu - lous than this recommendation .

		None but the very best should be read from cover to cover , and not even the best is worth reading when it begins to weary . ''

		• • •
Henry the Eighth	ORGANIZATION	's comments on matrimony ought to be illuminating .

		He certainly had a wealth of matrimonial experience such as is granted to few .

		A copy -LRB- bearing evidence of having been owned by this much-married monarch -RRB- of the first edition -LRB- 1526 -RRB- of the ''
Christiani Matrimonii	PERSON	Institutio '' of
Erasmus	PERSON	has been unearthed by a bookseller of
St. Martin 's Lane	ORGANIZATION	.

		Being published only a year before Hem-y appealed to 236 THE DIAL -LSB- AprU 16 , the Pope for a divorce from
Catherine	PERSON	of
Aragon	LOCATION	, it may well have proved a very timely addition to his library .

		To what extent the marginal notes and the imderlinings were the ripe fruitage of experience with his three
Catherines	ORGANIZATION	, his two
Annes	PERSON	, and his lamented
Jane	PERSON	, we shall never know ; nor indeed whether in very truth this running commentary is from his
august	DATE	hand .

		It is at least said to be illegible enough to be the writing of a very illustrious personage .

		• • • The awakening of
Rochester	LOCATION	readers has come at last .

		That city and
New Orleans	LOCATION	are the only large cities in the country that have thus far found life toler - able without a public library .

		But now the citizens of one of these places at least are asking for better things .

		Their wishes are voiced by the mayor in his annual message and by the superintendent of education in his yearly report . ''

		The establishment of a public library , '' declares Mayor
Edgerton	PERSON	, '' is much to be desired , and I earnestly hope that means may be provided to accom - plish this result . ''

		And Superintendent
Carroll	PERSON	says : '' The lack of this delayed public necessity is a most serious defect in our educational system , and retards relatively the intelligence and culture of the entire community . ''

		We should regard the retardation as positive and imqualifled .

		Now let us hear from
New Orleans	LOCATION	.

		, , , The versatile and scholarly Mr.
G. Lowes Dickinson	PERSON	, after interesting us in Chinese affairs as viewed by a Chinese official , in the Greek way of look - ing at life , in the meaning of good , and in divers other matters , is to continue his disquisitions in a volume entitled '' Justice and Liberty , '' which is promised for early publication .

		Furthermore , and perhaps more important still , Mr.
Dickinson	PERSON	has been chosen as next year 's IngersoU lecturer at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	.

		This lectureship , established a few years ago by a bequest from the late
George Goldthwait	PERSON	IngersoU , has for its subject '' The Immortality of Man , '' and has been filled by Professors
Royce	PERSON	,
Miinsterberg	LOCATION	,
James	PERSON	, and
Palmer	PERSON	, and other men of note , both lay and clerical ; but it is our impres - sion that never before has a lecturer been invited from abroad .

		Mr.
Dickinson	PERSON	is worthy of the distinction .

		• • • Some unpublished letters of
Edward Fitz	PERSON	-
Gerald	PERSON	are promised in a volume which Mr.

		The book is an account of the singular friendship and business rela - tions that existed between
FitzGerald	PERSON	and the captain of his herring lugger ,
Joseph Fletcher	PERSON	-- familiar to readers of the Letters as '' Posh . '' ''

		Altogether the Greatest Man I have known '' was
FitzGerald	PERSON	's char - acterization of his unlettered shipmaster , -- certainly a flattering estimate from one who numbered among his intimates such lions as

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		LIBRARIES AND BOOK-LOVERS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		As I have read Mr.
Briggs	PERSON	's complaint about the increasing scarcity of book-lovers among librarians , followed by Mr.
Bailey	PERSON	's comment , I have wondered how far libraries may be responsible for the increasing scarcity of book-lovers in the world .

		Is n't it true that to love books one must live with them ?

		Nowadays the average person , and even the average family , depends entirely upon libraries for reading matter .

		We do n't buy books ; we borrow them , -- not as the book-lover borrows , to return no more , but with a business-like proviso that the volumes are unfailmgly to be brought back by a certain specified date , failing in which we pay a fine .

		Reading thus becomes a business , to be dis - posed of within a definite period . ''

		Seven-day Book , '' tagged on to all the new fiction and some of the more popular essays and biographies -- who can become deeply attached to a '' Seven-day Book '' ?

		What real friendship with a book ever developed even within the more generous allotment of two weeks , the regular library prescription ?

		Being country-born and bred , I grew up in a home blessed with books .

		Ours was not an especially large or well-chosen library , but it looms to vast and classic pro- portions when compared with the constantly changing shelf-full of rapidly aging current fiction that forms the only apology for a library in many homes of a younger and more sophisticated generation .

		When I am away from my own books and need to consult a play of Shakespeare or a volume of Thackeray or Rxiskin , I proffer my request at the library window with a feel - ing that it requires explanation .

		But it does n't ; the business-like librarian sees no anomaly in the cultured person 's getting any book where all books are to be had gratis .

		As a business matter this is sound , but it does n't appeal to the book-lover .

		He haunts the shops , not the public libraries , and he treasures his own books , bought very often at a sacrifice of other necessities , as he would never value the privilege of consulting , with regulations , a thousand times their number .

		The sense of possession enters , however slightly , into every form of real affection .

		Who can feel it -- who indeed has the right to feel it -- towards the scarred and battered denizens of the
Public Library	ORGANIZATION	shelves ?

		FICTION IN THE BOSTON AND

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		In the '' Casual Comment '' department of
The Dial	ORGANIZATION	for
April 1	DATE	, your comparison of the fiction departments of the
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	and the
Trenton	LOCATION	,
N. J.	PERSON	, Library is hardly fair , -- possibly for the reason that the library reports are not plain to you .

		The statement that the
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	'' has in three consecutive years purchased 129 , 161 , and 167 novels from the great mass of English fiction examined by the Commit - tee '' is possibly correct .

		It means titles , however , not volumes .

		Only the report of the librarian will show how many copies of each title were placed in the library , or how many volumes were purchased to replace those worn out .

		The
Trenton	LOCATION	library added
1882	DATE	volumes of fiction .

		To a library worker this covers all new titles and replace - ments , including stories in the children 's department .

		I am not defending the fiction department of the
Trenton	LOCATION	library , but merely attempting to get the matter right from a library standpoint .

		THE DIAL 237 t E ^ to ^ 00hs .

		Lord
Cromer ox Modern Egypt	ORGANIZATION	.

		* The marvellous transformation wrought out in
Egypt	LOCATION	under British rule , and the methods by which it was accomplished , have come to be a favorite theme for retired Anglo-Egyptian statesmen .

		Some years ago Lord
Milner	PERSON	pub - lished his '' England in
Egypt	LOCATION	'' ; a few months ago Sir
Auckland Colvin	PERSON	's '' The Making of Modern Egypt '' was reviewed in The Dial ; and now we have Lord Cromer 's '' Modern Egypt , '' in two handsome volumes .

		Of all those who have told the story of English rule in
Egypt	LOCATION	no one is so well equipped for the task , and , it may be added , no one has per - formed the task so
weU	ORGANIZATION	, as Lord Cromer .

		His official career in
Egypt	LOCATION	began even before English occupation -LRB-
March , 1877	DATE	-RRB- , and con - tinued to
1907	DATE	, when he retired full of years and honors .

		Parliament showing its appreciation of his long and distinguished services by voting him a grant of fifty thousand pounds .

		During this long period of nearly thirty years Lord Cromer was , as he says , '' behind the scenes in Egyptian affairs , '' and English achievements there were more the result of his masterly in - fluence than of anything else .

		The author 's purpose in writing this book was , he says , first , `` to place on record an ac - curate narrative of some of the principal events which have occurred in
Egypt	LOCATION	since
1876	DATE	, '' and , second , '' to explain the results which have accrued to
Egypt	LOCATION	from the British occupation of the country in
1882	DATE	. ''

		In addition to the wealth of material that has come from his own extended observations and his acquaintanceship with almost everyone who has taken a leading part in Egyptian affairs since the beginning of English occupation , he has had access to aU the documents in the archives of the Foreign Offices of both
London	LOCATION	and
Cairo	LOCATION	.

		The re - markable story of
Egypt	LOCATION	under British ride has been told by Lord Cromer with a straightfor - wardness , an accuracy , and a charm of style never equalled in any other work dealing with the subject .

		From a recital of the financial chaos which led to British intervention in
1882	DATE	Lord Cromer reviews in succession the history of the country under the guiding hand of English statesmen , the rise and fall of Pashas and
Khedives	PERSON	, the triumphs of the Eng lish
Army	ORGANIZATION	of occupation , * Modern
Egypt	LOCATION	.

		By the
Earl of Cromer	ORGANIZATION	.

		In two volumes .

		With portraits .

		New York :
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		the thrilling story of
Gordon	PERSON	, the fall and re - conquest of
Khartoum	LOCATION	, the problems of political readjustment and reconstruction , and the final withdrawal of French opposition through the Anglo-French Convention of
1904	DATE	, which leaves
England	LOCATION	a free hand to carry out to full com - pletion the great task she began twenty-five years ago .

		Of this latter event Lord Cromer says : '' I rejoice that my connection lasted long enough to enable me to see the friendly relations of the past reestablished after an interlude of misunderstanding which was detrimental alike to British , French , and Egyptian interests . ''

		Of the justification of the English occupation Lord Cromer has never entertained any doubt except as an academic question .

		The cannon which swept away the Dervish hordes at
Omdurman	LOCATION	, he says , proclaimed to the world that on
England	LOCATION	had devolved tTie solemn and responsible duty of introducing , the light of Western civilization amongst the sorely tried people of the Soudan .

		The change which has taken place in
Egypt	LOCATION	under British occupation is , he declares , nothing less than remarkable , and can be fully appreciated only by those who are in some degree familiar with the system under which the country was governed in the days of
Ismail Pasha	LOCATION	.

		The extent of the change is well summarized by Lord Cromer in the fol - lowing words : '' A new spirit has been instilled into the population of
Egypt	LOCATION	.

		Even the peasant has leamt to scan his rights .

		Even the
Pasha	PERSON	has learnt that others besides himself have rights which must be respected .

		The courbash may hang on the walls of Moudirieh , but the Moudir no longer dares to employ it on the backs of the fellaheen .

		For all practical purposes , it may be said that the hateful corvde system has disappeared .

		Slav - ery has virtually ceased to exist .

		The halcyon days of the adventurer and the usurer are past .

		Fiscal burthens have been greatly relieved .

		Everywhere law reigns supreme .

		Justice is no longer bought and sold .

		Nature , instead of being spurned and neglected , has been wooed to bestow her gifts on mankind .

		She has responded to the appeal .

		The waters of the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	are now utilized in an intelligent manner .

		Means of loco - motion have been improved and extended .

		The soldier has acquired some pride in the imiform which he wears .

		He has fought as he never fought before .

		The sick man can be nursed in a well-managed hospital .

		The lunatic is no longer treated like a wild beast .

		The punishment awarded to the worst criminal is no longer barbarous .

		Lastly , the schoolmaster is abroad , with results which are as yet uncertain , but which can not fail to be important . ''

		The difficulties of
England	LOCATION	's task and the embarrassments of the great pro-consul 's own position were indeed large .

		Between the English - man and the Egyptian there was a '' thick mist '' composed of '' religious prejudice , antique and 238 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, semi-barbarous customs , international rivalry , vested interests and aspirations of one sort and another , some sordid , others not ignoble but incapable of realization . ''

		Cromer tells us that at times he had '' to retire into his own diplo - matic shell '' and pose as one amongst many representatives of foreign powers .

		At other times he had to step forward as the representa - tive of the Sovereign whose soldiers had
Egypt	LOCATION	in their grip .

		At one time he had to defend
Egypt	LOCATION	against European aggression , and some - times in the early days to defend the British position against foreign attack .

		He had to keep in touch with the weU-intentioned , but occasion - ally iU-informed , public opinion of
England	LOCATION	, to maintain British authority and at the same time hide as much as possible the fact that he was maintaining it , to work through British agents over whom he possessed no control , to avoid any step which might involve European complication , to keep the Egyptian question simmering , and to avoid any action which might tend to force on its premature consideration , etc. .

		Of the future of
Egypt	LOCATION	Lord Cromer thinks there are two alternative courses : either it must become autonomous , or it must be incorporated into the British Empire , and his own personal preference is in favor of moving in the direction of the former alternative .

		He does not , however , favor the immediate or even the early withdrawal of
Great Britain	LOCATION	, but only the adoption of a policy looking toward that step as an ultimate goal .

		Of the many delusions which at one time existed about
Egypt	LOCATION	, the greatest of all , he says , is the idea that
England	LOCATION	can shake herself free of the Egyptian Question merely by withdrawing the British garrison and then declaring to the world that the Egyptians must get on as well as they can by themselves .

		A fairly good and stable government must be insured until the Egyptians are capable of governing themselves without the presence of a foreign army in their midst , and without foreign guidance in civil and military - affairs .

		That time Lord Cromer thinks has not yet come , but , on the contrary , is far distant , and one or two generations must pass away before the question can even be usefully discussed .


James W. Garner	PERSON	.

		M. JussERAND , the French Ambassador to the
United States	LOCATION	, has contributed a critical essay entitled ``
Ben Jonson	PERSON	's Views on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Art '' to the ''
Strat	PERSON	- ford Town Edition '' of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's works which
Messrs. Duffield & Company	ORGANIZATION	will issue shortly .

		To this set is attached the unique interest of having been printed in Stratf ord-on-Avon , and in an old Tudor house next door but one to
New Place	LOCATION	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's home .

		The
Neav Dictionary of Artists	ORGANIZATION	.

		* A general book of reference covering the artists of the world , with their names in alpha - betical order and a critical notice of each artist , is so very important to us aU that it seems worth while to consider what there is , and what there may be , in that field .

		Of the new book , in twenty large volumes , whose title is given below , only one volume is as yet in being ; but that one volume may be compared with the books which already exist .

		Nagler 's '' AllgemeinesKiinstler-lexikon '' was the standby of a former generation ; but , having been completed in
1852	DATE	, it is neither full enough nor critical enough for the twen - tieth century .

		Dr.
J. Meyer	PERSON	with his associates undertook , in
1870	DATE	, such a revision and enlarge - ment of
Nagler	PERSON	as was then possible ; but that work has never passed the third volume and the name '' Bezzuoli . ''

		The scheme of those two works was nearly universal , -- an alphabet of surnames of all who had produced works of fine art worthy of mention ; and , as the
Nagler	PERSON	work extended to twenty-two volumes , it was reasonably full .

		On a much smaller scale , but with equal completeness of scheme , the '' Allgemeines Kiinstler-Lexikon '' which bore the name of Seubert filled three octavo volumes , as against the twenty-two somewhat larger volumes of
Nagler	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was the most useful of ready reference books , until superseded by newer editions of practically the same book under other distinctive names .

		The edition in five volumes , dated 1895-1901 , bears on the title - pages the names of
H. A. MiiUer	PERSON	and
H. W. Singer	ORGANIZATION	.

		No one who is in search of an inex - pensive dictionary of artists need hope for a better book than the one last named ; and with the naming of it the subject of the universal lexicon may be dismissed until the seeker takes up the first volume of Thieme and Becker .

		All other similar books of reference are limited in scope , and restricted in one or another fashion .

		Bryan 's '' Dictionary of Painters and En - gravers '' is nearly a century old , but we need not reckon with any edition earlier than that revised by Graves and
Armstrong	ORGANIZATION	and finished in
1889	DATE	.

		That book again was superseded by the reissue imder the charge of
G. C. Williamson	PERSON	and published in five very large volumes during •

		THE DIAL 239 1903-5 .

		It has one excellent feature , -- a table of the works of each artist thought nota - ble , the classification being by museums and galleries of art as far as might be .

		Complete - ness in this was not proposed , -- obviously it would be impracticable , -- and there are even exceptions to the rule of its introduction , as where the long notice of
William Blake	PERSON	offers no list at all of his productions , but names some of them only in the course of critical remark .

		The true limitations to the utility of Bryan are , however , to be found in its insularity of scope .

		It was said long ago that the English art student rarely sees anything important in painting except the works of the great Italians and those of the Englishmen who have studied , and followed or refused to follow , the early Italians ; that he is prone to skip over two and one-half centuries , and all of
Europe	LOCATION	which lies between the Alps and the Channel .

		The
Bryan Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	seems to have been put together as if to confirm that view in a slightly modified form , so extraor - dinary are the omissions , and so odd to a general student of graphic art are the proportions observed .

		And then , again ,
Bryan	PERSON	deals only with the artists who have died -LRB- excepting one or two who are mentioned as having abandoned the practice of their art -RRB- , and on this account is destined to pass out of date at a relatively early period .

		This is true of '' Painters and their Works '' by
R. N. James	PERSON	, in three not large volumes ; a book otherwise weU fitted for daily reference when painting , only , is in question .

		The '' Encyclopaedia of Painters and Paint - ings , '' edited by
Champlin	PERSON	and
Perkins	PERSON	, and brought down to
1887	DATE	, is strictly confined to its own subject .

		In like manner ,
Redgrave	PERSON	's admirable '' Dictionary of Artists of the English School , '' published in
1874	DATE	, is evidently of small scope -- made smaller by the exclusion of living artists .

		It is nearly so with
Clement	PERSON	and
Hutton	PERSON	's '' Artists of the
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, '' published in
1879	DATE	, and with the famous books of reference for print-coUeetors by
Bartsch	PERSON	and Passavant and less known authors , and with
Anderson	PERSON	's '' Descriptive and Historical Cata - logue of Japanese and Chinese Paintings '' -- these special books are material for a universal dictionary like
Thieme	PERSON	and
Becker	PERSON	; it is unjust to all concerned to institute any comparison between them .

		Comparison of one volume of such a work with corresponding parts of other dictionaries is likely to be ineffective , because of differences of method .

		Bryan , for instance , treats the subject ''
Allegri	PERSON	-LRB- Antonio -RRB- '' in a fuU notice , '' Andrea d'Agnolo '' rather too briefly , and '' Androuet , '' the architect and draughtsman of the French Renaissance , in thirty lines besides a list of items ; but the new book refers these terms to ''
Correggio	LOCATION	, '' '' Sarto -LRB- A. del -RRB- , '' and '' Ducerceau . ''

		Perhaps we may like the English - man 's method of treating each subject under the name of the artist rather than the surname or the nickname .

		Such a method is more capable of consistent use throughout ; even as the English '' Dictionary of National Biography '' prefers family names , such as
Cecil	PERSON	and
Caven	PERSON	- dish , to titles of nobility , as
Salisbury	LOCATION	and Devonshire ; but all this is really indifferent .

		Sometimes the two books reverse their practice . ''

		Fra Angelico '' is turned over to ''
Fiesole	LOCATION	'' in the English book , but has in
Thieme	LOCATION	and Becker twelve columns -LRB- six pages -RRB- under '' Angelico . ''

		In other items , comparison is more feasible and more instructive .


Andrea Andreani	PERSON	, the name signed to so many chiaroscuro prints of the sixteenth century , has thirty lines in
Bryan	LOCATION	, followed by a long list of the titles of prints ; while in the German book there is reference to
Bartsch	PERSON	for the needed list of prints , and four solid columns of critical discussion of the many doubtfid questions about this mass of work , with brief and yet comprehensive description , a little remote to the reader who knows not tint - printing from several blocks , but as simply and quietly worded as was possible to the German Gelehrte who signs his work ''
K. P. '' Albrecht Altdorf	PERSON	er , highly praised and carefully criticised in the English book , receives in the German volume a long notice , full of learning and observation , signed '' Paidy . ''


Washington Allston	LOCATION	has had allowed to him a fairly sufficient space in either book , the
Allston	LOCATION	notice in the new volume being very judicious ; it is signed by
Edmund von Mach	PERSON	.

		Alma Tadema , ex - cluded from
Bryan	PERSON	and from the great English `` Dictionary of National Biography '' ' because still admissible to '' Who 's Who , '' has a page of Thieme and Becker .


Alessandro Allori	PERSON	-LRB- his teacher ,
Agnolo Allori	PERSON	, is referred to Bronzino -RRB- receives more notice than some purists would award him -- nearly four colmnns ; and even his son Cristofano , a decadent if there ever was one , is allowed a page .

		These Bolognese painters are treated in cursory fashion in the Bryan dictionary .

		The great
Alberti	PERSON	, chief glory of the classical revival of the fifteenth century , is not thought a fit subject for any list of painters and en - gTavers , but receives the full fifteen pages -- 240 THE DIAL -LSB- Aprn 16 , the limit of favor , as the preface declares -- in the German book .

		James and
Robert Adam	PERSON	, the eighteenth century architects of
London	LOCATION	fame , have their full share of notice ; and of these two ,
Robert	PERSON	, the author of the great study of the Roman palace at
Spalato	LOCATION	, is accepted as the more important personality .

		There are many architects whose record is found in
Thieme	LOCATION	and Becker .

		Alkamenes , the friend of Phidias , has six columns as against one-fifth as much space under '' Alcamenes '' in
Smith	PERSON	's '' Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology , '' and about the same allowance of room in the Pauly-Wissowa ' ' Real-Encyclopaedie . ' '

		Andronikos of Kyrrhos in
Syria	LOCATION	, known to English writers as
Cyrrhestes	LOCATION	, and famous as the builder of the '' Tower of the Winds '' at
Athens	LOCATION	, has a column-long notice : though he is called a founder or deviser , rather than an artist .

		Anthemios of Tralles , the great man to whom , with the able assistance of Isidoros of
Miletos	LOCATION	, the world owes
Sancta Sophia	LOCATION	at
Constantinople	LOCATION	, has his five columns .

		Abadie , the French architect , who died in
1884	DATE	, is per - fectly well studied in the short notice which specifies his chief title to our remembrance -- though the hatred he excited as the '' restorer '' of Saint Front at
Perigueux	LOCATION	could hardly be discussed .


Alexander Anderson	PERSON	, the American wood - engraver born in
1775	DATE	, has half a column , and of him it is said that he was the first in
America	LOCATION	to use box - wood for engraving -- namely , in '' The Looking Glass for the Mind , '' published 1795-8 .

		Under the term '' Aligny '' is given a notice of the landscape painter more often spoken of as Theodore CarueUe d'Aligny and studied as an engraver and etcher .

		Vapereau 's '' Dictionnaire des Contemporains '' tells of him ; but the German notice is fuller and much more critical .

		It is interesting , this hunting for the little-known men , like
Alfarano	PERSON	, whom we asso - ciate with our only artistic record of the ancient basilica of Saint
Peter	PERSON	on the
Vatican	ORGANIZATION	hill .

		The only notice of him to be discovered in a modem book of reference is here ; and care is taken to point out that he is not necessarily the draughts - man or the engraver , but perhaps the ecclesias - tical dignitary , -- the patron , only .

		Artists of the farthest East are included in this new book , -- as where
Aimi	PERSON	, called Soken , a Japanese of the ninth or tenth century
A. D.	PERSON	, is named as having been a member of the national commission on painting : ''
Regierungs	PERSON	- kommission fiir Malerei . ''

		Has not that phrase a modern sound ?

		Ameya was a Korean or a Chinese , who in the
sixteenth century A.D.	DATE	established a school of potters in
Japan	LOCATION	.

		He was naturalized , and took the name
Sokei	PERSON	, founding the family known as
Sasaki	PERSON	.

		Moslem builders and carvers , in
Egypt	LOCATION	and in
Spain	LOCATION	, are to be found under '' Al-Kutami , '' and under the often recurring name '' Abdallah . ''

		A name foimd on an Arabic vessel , exhibited in
1878	DATE	, has introduced us to the potter ,
Abd-el-Fakir El Hadjaj-Mohammed	ORGANIZATION	.

		Byzantine painting of the Cretan school in the seventeenth century is named under ''
Angelos Kres	PERSON	. ''

		Makers and painters of Greek vases are , of course , numerous .

		The result of a long examination of the volume is an enthusiastic hope that here , at last , we are to have an adequate dictionary of artists .

		A new volume every four or six months may be looked for .


Russell Sturgis	PERSON	.

		A German View ^ of the Great English Commoner .

		* When Dr.
Albert von Ruville	PERSON	published his German biography of the
Earl	PERSON	of
Chatham	LOCATION	, three years ago , it was recognized at once that the career of that vigorous and picturesque statesman had at last found a student who was equal to the task .

		English and American reviewers found much to criticize : in a few instances the author was convicted of errors that careful study should have corrected ; many of his more important conclusions were chal - lenged ; and attention was called to a number of ludicrous mistakes , largely the result of careless proof-reading .

		But after all this had been said , the unusual merit of the work had to be granted .

		That such a work would be speedily translated into English was to be expected ; and such a translation has now appeared .

		In its English form , the biography comprises three solid vol - umes of about four hundred pages each .

		The first volume deals with the usual subjects intro - ductory to such a study --
Pitt	PERSON	's ancestry , educa - tion , and introduction to life , and carries the narrative of his official career down to the declaration of war against
France	LOCATION	in
1756	DATE	; the second reveals to us the great statesman and the war minister , and covers the eventftd years
1756	DATE	to
1761	DATE	; in the remaining volume is told the story of the long decline ending with
Pitt	PERSON	's death in
1778	DATE	.

1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 241 of common historical knowledge , and it was not to be expected that recent research would modify the general outline to any appreciable extent .

		Dr. von RuvQle sees the course of eighteenth - century history very much as it has been viewed before ; still , his work differs greatly from the English writings on the same subject .

		His attitude is that of a critic , not an advocate , and censure frequently appears where formerly we were accustomed to find unqualified praise .

		Different and apparently far more just are also his estimates of the men who shared with
Pitt	PERSON	the duties and cares of government .

		With all his faults -LRB- and the author does not conceal them -RRB- ,
Newcastle	ORGANIZATION	was at bottom a strong man and a keen politician , not the incompetent that some have described .

		The estimate of
Lord Bute	ORGANIZATION	is also favorable : in unselfish patriotism and devotion to king and country he is more than
Pitt	PERSON	's equal .

		George III .

		seems less of an enemy to the British constitution after one has read von
Ruville	ORGANIZATION	's masterful analysis of the political situation in the earlier years of the new reign .

		Another important feature is the promi - nence given to
Continental	ORGANIZATION	affairs ; for the first time , perhaps , the importance of the Prussian alliance is stated at its true value .

		It may be said in this connection that the author 's opinion of the English military leaders of the Seven Years ' War is anything but high ; but impartial justice is hardly to be expected from a German critic whose interest in the subject grew out of a study in the military career of the great
Frederick	PERSON	.

		The value of Dr.
von Ruville	PERSON	's work is not so much in the carefully constructed narrative as in the discussions of social and political forces , in the revealing of secret motives and hidden influences , in the insight afforded into the polit - ical workings of the Whig system .

		But the Author 's strength is also his weakness ; conclu - sions and inferences of this nature are usually based on circumstantial evidence , and in the use of such evidence a temper is often displayed that is neither judicious nor fair .

		We have long been in the habit of regarding
Pitt	PERSON	as the incorruptible commoner , the great orator , the lover of peace , and the friend of American liberty .

		This conception , though possibly correct in outline , is doubtless highly idealized .

		That
Pitt	PERSON	was impervious to the ordinary means of corruption , von Ruville freely concedes ; but he believes that at times even he yielded to influences of the baser sort .

		His '' singular behavior in
1744	DATE	, when he joined against his principles the party which was anxious to throw itself unconditionally into the arms of the Pelhamites , '' the author attributes to a legacy left him in the will of the Duchess of
Marlborough	LOCATION	, whom he now became anxious to please .

		Similarly , his violent opposition to the men who made the peace of
Paris	LOCATION	in
1763	DATE	was based , not on principle , but on a desire to satisfy an aged , eccentric , unreasoning , but wealthy Whig lord .

		Sir
William Pynsent	PERSON	, who had made
Pitt	PERSON	his heir to extensive estates in Somersetshire .

		His neutral position on the American question , in
1774	DATE	, is attributed to a similar motive .

		The author apparently accepts the explanation of the Prussian ambassador : '' He has two young sons to place , and only two months ago the king presented the elder of these with an ensign 's commission . ''

		In discussing
Pitt	PERSON	's agitation for parliamentary reform , von Ruville characterizes his political morality in the following terms : '' In this , as in all cases , his objects were eminently practical and selfish .

		He supported everything that could help his plans , and opposed all that thwarted them ; at a comparatively early date he had conceived the idea , though he had not elaborated it , that an excellent foun - dation of success might be laid by the strictest possible observance of political morality , and by the adoption of a certain lofty and disinterested attitude upon sordid questions of ways and means . ''

		To this .

		Professor
Egerton	PERSON	, in his '' general introduction , '' rejoins that '' Had such been the real
Pitt	PERSON	, it would hardly have been necessary for Dr. von Ruville to write those volumes of his biography . ''

		Nor is the author impressed with
Pitt	PERSON	's great - ness as an orator .

		His manner was impressive , but in argument he was often weak .

		The biog - rapher makes a laborious attempt to place this conclusion on a historic foundation , but without success , as no such foundation can be built ; all that we know of the matter of
Pitt	PERSON	's speeches is derived from the memories of those who heard them .

		That
Pitt	PERSON	affected the dramatic , is evi - dent ; we are told that he even used his old enemy , the gout , to give emphasis to his oratory .

		Perhaps the best Ulustration of this is his appear - ance in Parliament in
January , 1745	DATE	, which is thus described : ''
Pitt	PERSON	then made a highly dramatic appearance .

		His stay in Bath had given him little benefit , and he was still suffering from the gout , though it may be doubted whether his sufferings were as serious as he asserted .

		In any case he appeared wrapped in bandages , supported upon crutches , and provided with the necessaries of an invalid ; and thus aroused the general attention .

		Then he raised his powerful voice and pointed to his bandaged limbs as evidence of the importance of a debate which would have brought him to the spot even upon the last day of his life . ''

		242 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, The point of criticism that in this case any verbal reference to the speaker 's illness should have been unnecessary , is doubtless well taken .

		But the author adds that ''
Pitt	PERSON	's behavior in the course of his speech , in which he rose to his full height and gesticulated vigorously '' really made it necessary for him '' to strengthen the belief in his sufferings ... by outward show and by strong reference to his malady . ''

		For Americans who remember
Pitt	PERSON	principally for the stand he took on the colonial question in the closing years of his life , it is easy to hold the honored idea that
Pitt	PERSON	was eminently a believer in conciliation and peace .

		The real facts , on the contrary , show that his passion was war ; in earlier life he had hoped for an import - ant military command ; later , his great desire was to have the management of a war .

		He used his office as paymaster-general , not to acquire a familiarity with financial details , but '' to extend his military knowledge , and to gain special in - formation of movements against the enemy . ''

		When he entered the ministry , in
1757	DATE	, it was expressly stipulated that
Pitt	PERSON	was to have the conduct of the war then raging .

		And when the time came to treat with the enemy , his terms were not such as to indicate any great longing for peace . ''


Chatham	LOCATION	's greatness did not lie in counsel , in his home or his foreign policy ; it lay entirely in action .

		It was when decision was taken , when he was placed in authority and the time had come to act , that he showed what he was . ''

		Von
Ruville	ORGANIZATION	's second volume is a commentary on these sentences .

		The Seven Years ' War was
Pitt	PERSON	's opportunity , -- it enabled him to de - monstrate his great administrative abilities .

		Throughout this part of the work the treatment is sympathetic and appreciative ; for
Pitt	PERSON	the war minister the author displays an admiration that does not extend to the orator in opposition .

		In this volume we are given a circumstantial history of this tremendous war , with the empha - sis on
Pitt	ORGANIZATION	's wonderful management .

		His plans are detailed with painstaking care , those that failed as well as those that succeeded .

		But in this discussion , too , the minister is at times given scant justice : it is hard to believe that in ap - pointing General Abercrombie to the American command ,
Pitt	PERSON	purposely selected a weak gen - eral , since '' a man of greater capacity than
Loudoun	LOCATION	... might easily have proved obsti - nate and inconvenient in the important position of commander-in-chief . ''

		In
1761	DATE	, when the war was drawing to a close ,
Pitt	PERSON	resigned , -- but not , as is commonly thought , because he was forced to do so ; '' it rather seems that
Pitt	PERSON	, against the wish of the king and his colleagues , seized the opportunity of resignation . ''

		Condi - tions demanded either a change in policy or a new chief ; and
Pitt	PERSON	found resignation easier than change .

		With
Pitt	PERSON	's position on the American ques - tion , Dr. von Ruville is not in sympathy ; in a measure , he holds him responsible for the troubles that culminated in the Revolutionary War .

		Prior to the passage of the Stamp Act , the king had called him to the chief ministry ; but he had declined the honor . ''

		His consideration of purely material interests , his hope of a con - siderable inheritance -- for in no other way is his behavior to be explained -- had prevented him from seizing the helm of state at the right moment and guiding the country through the difficulties of the American question to the shore of reconciliation . ''

		Pitt favored a large measure of seK-government for the colonies , but insisted at the same time on the supremacy of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	.

		He would relieve them of the burden of internal taxation , -- their assemblies were the proper agencies for such purposes .

		But his arguments on the subjects of repre - sentation and taxation do not seem to have impressed his biographer very favorably : they were '' more distinguished by enthusiasm for liberty than by legal insight . ''

		When
Pitt	PERSON	in
1766	DATE	, as
Earl of Chatham	LOCATION	, reentered the ministry and was called on to construct a colonial policy , we have another instance of his '' singular behavior . ''

		He had now to choose between the conciliatory policy of
Shelburne	LOCATION	and the aggressive measures urged by
Townshend	PERSON	.

		He refused , however , to make the choice , and referred the subject to
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	.

		The author appears to believe that the prime minister felt himself committed to a line of action that he saw was impractiisal , but found with - drawal easier than the adoption of new plans .

		In
1773	DATE	Chatham 's views appear to have been less favorable to the colonial cause : he was shocked at the news of the
Boston Tea Party	ORGANIZATION	.

		In a speech in
May	DATE	of the following year , he practically demanded that the revolt be suppressed , but favored leniency as a matter of expediency .

		It is significant that in discuss - ing the
Quebec	LOCATION	Act he omitted all reference to the great grievance of the Americans , the matter of delimitation .

		But during the
summer	DATE	of this year he came under the influence of Benjamin
Franklin	PERSON	, with the result that his views changed materially .

		A few months later , the demand was no longer for leniency , but for justice ; not

		Chatham 's plan , laid before Parliament in

America	LOCATION	, '' the author con - siders thoroughly impractical ; in
England	LOCATION	it had few friends , and in
America	LOCATION	'' its proposals met with unambiguous condemnation . ''

		As the war progressed ,
Chatham	LOCATION	came to believe that
America	LOCATION	could not be conquered ; at the same time , he refused to entertain the suggestion that American independence should be recognized .

		It is difficult to see how any - one holding such irreconcilable views could contribute much to the solution of the colonial problem after
1776	DATE	.

		The suggestion that even as late as 1777 a ministry headed by
Chatham	LOCATION	might have evolved some plan of reconciliation finds no support in the present biography .


William Pitt	PERSON	could carry out a policy , but could not initiate one ; he was an administrator , not a constructive statesman .

		It remains for future students to determine whether this view of '' the Great Commoner '' is historically cor - rect ; but Dr.
von Ruville	PERSON	's study is the work of a master , and his conclusions can not be lightly set aside .

		Another Interpretation of Buddhism .

		* The twentieth-century task of uniting and conciliating the Orient and the Occident calls to its behest every sort of interpreter .

		Let the scholar who has a conscience towards texts , history , science , and reason , nut despise those who from emotion and self - chosen bias set them - selves deliberately to '' interpret '' the
East	LOCATION	.

		We have had an example of one who retired from the Western world , making himself a sen - sitive plate to record his impressions of
Japan	LOCATION	, -- which many among us receive as facts .

		Yet while the tints in the glasses worn may change , or may remain green or rose , the reality beneath abides .

		Even when one , mentally or in the body , retires from the white man 's world and pictures
Burma	LOCATION	, we who can not forget scrip - tures , or history , or science , or who know something of our own traditions , religion , and mentality , crave more matter-of-fact -- even dry-as-dust bases of reality , and less rhapsody .

		style , its quite feminine loveliness of method , on the one hand , and its strenuous claim to serious attention as truth on the other .

		Any panegyric , however extravagant , we are willing to bestow on its literary form .

		Charming , even enchant - ing , is this bit of philosophy disguised as a work of fiction .

		But as a presentation of Buddhism it lacks all the marks of serious acquaintance with originals or reality . ''

		The West , '' the Christianity , and the history here presented are strangers to us , while the Buddhism set forth is neither of the Great nor the Lesser Vehicle .

		Even when we are told that '' the day died in scarlet agony , '' and that '' the couriers of the sun beat crimson light along the mountains , '' we still miss the real '' color '' of the
East	LOCATION	, though there is indeed much local Burmese '' colour , '' as it might have been enjoyed by a sentimental Englishman .

		Any acquaintance with com - parative religion , apart from that common in insular British society and among the plain folk of
Burma	LOCATION	, we do not discern .

		Nevertheless this genuinely impressionable writer has made us his debtor because of the charm of his pen .

		He -- or the printer 's devil possibly -- may spell `` Musselmans '' as '' Mus - selmen , '' call Shinto a true system of ancestral worship , which it is not , show a woeful lack of acquaintance with Buddhist writings , and assert a thousand things , which , to one who knows a little of both East and West , sound like deli - cious nonsense .

		Nevertheless , profound sym - pathy and kindly intercourse have made him a generous exponent , if not an interpreter fair to other religions and races .


Asia	LOCATION	has still a secret , and blessed are they who seek to learn it .

		Even without a civilization built on iron and coal it is possible to catch glimpses of eternal truth , and , abiding therein , to find daily hap - piness .

		This is the burden of the book , and despite all cold and critical comment , the mes - sage is a moving one .

		Those who , at our libra - ries , are content with '' popular '' science , who take their history in the form of fiction , and their theology direct from their pastors , will be equally satisfied to regard this book as a true interpretation of the Aryan teaching and Agnostic faith -- the product of '' the
Darwin	PERSON	of the soul . ''

		Only a few years ago , the
Boston Brahmins	ORGANIZATION	accepted Sir
Edwin Arnold	PERSON	's poem , '' The Light of
Asia	LOCATION	, '' as a true exposition of Buddhism , when it was in fact only a subjective rhapsody tricked out in Christian phrase , and as true to real life as is Gilbert and
Sullivan	PERSON	's extravaganza of '' The Mikado '' to Japanese history .

		244 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, A
Nativity Pi.ay	ORGANIZATION	in
Mexico	LOCATION	.

		* In its ninth Memoir , the
American Folk-Lore Society	ORGANIZATION	presents the text and translation of a Mexican Play of the
Nativity	ORGANIZATION	.

		In
1893	DATE	the veteran observer , Captain
John G. Boiirke	PERSON	, called the attention of the Society to this play , in an article printed in its Journal .

		He saw the performance at
Rio Grande City	LOCATION	,
Texas	LOCATION	, in
1891	DATE	.

		It was given by a non-professional troupe of actors , most of whom could neither read nor write , who had been orally instructed in their parts by their leader -- a cobbler .

		Captain
Bourke	PERSON	had the leader write him out the full text .

		Two years later , at
San Antonio	LOCATION	,
Texas	LOCATION	, Captain
Bourke	PERSON	found the same play again , and secured photogi-aphs of the per - formers and phonograph records of the songs .

		It is this material -- text , photographs , and music -- that is presented in the Memoir before us , under the editorship of Mr.
M. R. Cole	PERSON	.

		Such plays are not uncommon in
Mexico	LOCATION	to - day .

		This one , in a somewhat variant form , was witnessed by the present reviewer in various villages around
Guadalajara	LOCATION	during the seasons between
1894	DATE	and
1897	DATE	.

		Throughout this region the play is purely traditional .

		While many leaders and trainers have manuscripts of the text , we have never seen an actual printed copy .

		The play is regularly rendered by a local group of amateur players taught and trained by one who has committed the play to memory or owns a manuscript of the text .

		The actors are mostly boys and young men from ten to twenty - three or twenty-four years of age .

		The play is usually rendered for the first time on Christmas Eve , at the home town of the players .

		For several evenings following it is given by the same players at village after village in the neighbor - hood , usually as an open-air performance , on the streets ; and the players afterward , going about the village from house to house , expect pres - ents , -- sweets , cakes , fruit , cigarettes , tequila , and money .

		The editor of this Memoir knows of the play as given at
San Rafael	LOCATION	,
New Mexico	LOCATION	, and at
Pueblo	LOCATION	,
Mexico	LOCATION	, -- as well as at the
Texas	LOCATION	town reported by Captain
Bourke	PERSON	; and from its widely-separated occurrences he decides that ''
Los Pastores	LOCATION	is an old play of Mexican origin . ''

		That the play was once common throughout
Mexico	LOCATION	, there can be no doubt .

		That it was played there through a long period of time is equally certain .

Mexico	LOCATION	was lost , it was quite natural that the old play should continue to thrive within the separated area .

		That it is still played there after sixty years of '' American '' control , will only surprise those who are fond of assuming that our country has great assimilative power .

		Our editor says , '' No inconsiderable part of the population of
Texas	LOCATION	is still Mexican in every - thing but name . ''

		Of course !

		It is not quite clear , however , why the editor assumes the play to be of Mexican origin .

		It may or may not be .

		All
Western Europe	LOCATION	once delighted in religious plays .

		Nowhere were they more popular than in
Spain	LOCATION	; nowhere were they so much used in propaganda ; no - where else did they occupy so large a share in the mind and thought of the people .

		Our editor justly remarks : '' Long after public taste -LSB- else - where -RSB- had outgrown these primitive spectacles , sacred drama continued to develop in
Spain	LOCATION	, aided by the intense Catholicism of the country , and by the restraint to which secular drama was subjected .

		Lope de
Vega	PERSON	lent the splendor of his genius to the autosacramental , while
Calderon	PERSON	raised that form of symbolic drama to its high - est level , contributing to the national repertory more than seventy
Corpus Christi	LOCATION	plays . '' ''

		Los Pastores '' may have originated in
Mexico	LOCATION	, but it is quite as likely to have come from the mother-country .

		Through the vice-royalty , all that came from
Spain	LOCATION	was admired ; what was of local production was on the whole more or less despised .

		When the first missionaries entered
Mexico	LOCATION	they certainly brought autos with them .

		In this new world they found Indians already delighting in spectacular public performances , and they promptly introduced the sacred drama among their native converts .

		These were often given at a cost of labor and trouble and money that would be remarkable even at the present day .

		Motolinia 's description of a
Corpus Christi	LOCATION	festival given in
1538	DATE	almost staggers belief .

		The editor of this volume has put a large amount of labor upon his task .

		A careful com - parison is made between the various versions accessible ; the metrical arrangement of the original is as nearly retained in the translation as is possible without the sacrifice of sense ; some passages can be traced back to Spanish nativities by
Antonio del Castillo	PERSON	and
Antonio Mira de Mescua	PERSON	, but the gi-eater part is still untraced .

		The rustic scenes of much of this untraced portion of the text influence the editor to refer the play as a whole to a Mexican rather than a Spanish source .

		As was to be expected .


1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 245 the spelling of tlie text as given is full of errors and inconsistencies ; the number of actual Mexi - canisms in it , however , are few .

		While the translation is carefully done , there are some points of easy criticism .

		Andres is a pretty name , quite capable of direct transfer into English , and not beyond translation .

		Why it should be rendered by ''
Jim	PERSON	's Gabe '' is a puz - zling question .

		But the work as a whole is too seriously and conscientiously done to warrant petty criticisms .

		The play of ''
Los Pastores	LOCATION	'' is probably a seventeenth century production .

		It varies in style '' from doggerel to the distinction of good Spanish models . ' '

		The actors are the Shepherds , the
Hermit	ORGANIZATION	, Lucifer , and the
Archangel Michael	ORGANIZATION	.

		The message of the
Nativity	ORGANIZATION	is announced , producing varying effects upon the different actors .

		The shepherds seek the babe and render adoration to him .

		A combat takes place between
Michael	PERSON	and Lucifer , in which the latter is finally subdued .

		The spirit of the play is on the whole good .

		There are fine passages , but there is also a good deal of coarse by-play .

		Most of the play is in versified mono - logue , but there are chorus-songs the airs of which are often pretty .

		Recent Fiction .

		* It is a pleasure to welcome Miss
Robins	PERSON	among the novelists once more , after her recent disastrous excursion into controversial fiction .

		It is still farther a pleasure to find her again occupied with the theme which inspired '' The Magnetic North , '' a book that had many constructive faults , but that largely made up for them by the vividness of its descriptive and dramatic passages . ''

Alaska	LOCATION	-LRB- although it does not take us to that region until we are more than midway in the narrative -RRB- , achieves its effects by force of im - aginative vision rather than by any observance of the rules of the novelist 's game ; but the effects , when they are achieved , are undeniably striking .

		The climax , which holds us in breathless suspense while we are nearing it , and leaves our emotions wellnigh exhausted when it is done with , is made possible only by a defiance of what would seem to be an ele - • CoME AND Find Me .

		mentary principle of construction .

		We have every reason to expect that
Jack Galbraith	PERSON	, who appears as a chubby infant in the opening chapters , is going to develop into the hero of the story , and he does , in a sense , but is kept away from tiie actual scene until the very end .

		We hear about him from time to time , and often expect him to appear in the flesh , but are disappointed again and again .

		Finally the heroine , who in search of her father has braved the horrors of the
Cape Nome	LOCATION	passage , and who has gone upon an expedition even farther northward , comes upon a lone hovel upon the desolate shore , and finds it occupied by an emaciated wreck of a man , stricken and starving , and an Eskimo dog in almost equally pitiable case .

		And this man is the
Jack Galbraith	PERSON	whose thought has filled her mind during all the years between childhood and woman - hood , and this is their first meeting , and their last , since the early days .

		Here are all the materials needed for a memorable situation , but it is made even more memorable by the story he tells her in his dying hour .

		For he and the dog are the sole survivors of a party that had accomplished the crowning task of exploration , and had actually set foot upon the
North Pole	LOCATION	.

		He still has with him the precious evidence -- maps , drawings , and scien - tific records -- of the achievement , and then and there , having told the tale , the woman and the dying man commit them to the flames .

		This really tremendous scene will long linger in the memory , and it is made even the more impressive for having been so long deferred .

		The rest of the book has value chiefly in preparing us for this consummation , although it includes much that deserves praise on its own account .

		Particularly is this true of the story of the voyage to
Nome	LOCATION	, and the vivid portrayal of the improvised mining camp upon the Arctic beach .

		The whole story , rambling and incoherent beyond what is ordinarily permissible , is redeemed by the bits of reality , the choses vues , that it gives us , first at intervals , and afterwards in almost continuous succession .

		It is assuredly a story with a grip , from its wavering beginnings in
Southern California	LOCATION	to its firm handling of the scenes by
Bering Sea	LOCATION	.

		We are getting a little tired of the class of novels to which '' Altars to Mammon '' belongs , but this is not a bad example of its class .

		The wealthy capi - talist who grinds the faces of the poor and salves his conscience by building churches has been worked to death of late , and ought to be allowed a season of decent retirement .

		He doubtless exists here and there , but he is by no means typically representative of our captains of industry .

		In the present instance he is painted in the most glaring colors , and his misdeeds have made him an object of general exe - cration .

		He lives in a region not exactly described -- somewhere in the mountain country of
Maryland	LOCATION	or
West Virginia	LOCATION	, -- and his luxurious residence is effectively contrasted with the mean homes of his fellow citizens .

		He has a daughter , of course , who believes him to be the soul of goodness , and whose eyes it is the stern task of the novelist to open .

		This 246 THE DIAL -LSB- AprU 16 , she does through the agency of the hero , a young Methodist minister , who is given this district as his first charge .

		Full of zeal he enters upon his mission , and soon finds himself at swords ' points with the moneyed interests of the region on the one hand , and with its ingrained religious bigotry on the other .

		During the months of stress and trial that follow , he g ^ ows sadly discouraged , but his spirit is not broken , and he gradually outgrows his own narrow - ness as he comes to realize that no religion that does not express itself in terms of social service can have any vital meaning .

		In time , his influence leavens the whole community , and the institutional worker takes the place of the preacher .

		Incidentally , he defeats the local magnate 's political ambitions , and carries off the daughter in triumph .

		Miss
Mary Imlay Taylor	PERSON	is a novelist whose work is always mannerly and pleasing , although it dis - plays no remarkable gift of either invention or characterization .

		It usually has a melodramatic tinge and a neatly contrived plot .

		Of late , it has taken to dealing with American life , and has thus come in closer touch with reality than when its scenes were laid in foreign countries . ''

		The Reap - ing , ''
Miss Taylor	PERSON	's newest book , is a novel of
Washington	LOCATION	society as it exists to-day , and has for its hero a brilliant congressman , in line for the highest political honors , who is confronted with the difficult problem of getting off with the old love and on with the new .

		The woman who has long held his affec - tions is married , but unhappily , and is impelled by her husband 's misconduct and her own recklessness to seek a divorce .

		But her lover 's feeling for her has by this time faded into a sentimental memory , and he has become seriously enthralled by the charms of a young girl whom he has recently come to know .

		This creates a perplexing situation for all three persons , for his sense of honor demands that he should offer his name to the woman who is freeing herself for his sake .

		The difficulty disap - pears with her death , as sudden as it is opportune for the novelist 's purpose .

		There are some half a dozen lesser figures who are sketched for us natur - ally and with a fair degree of penetration , and the general atmosphere of the social life of the capital is interestingly and almost brilliantly reproduced . ''

		The Measure of the Rule '' is a novel by Mr.
Robert Barr	PERSON	.

		What the title means is a mystery that we have not been able to fathom ; the story may be easily described by saying that it is in substance an account of a year spent by the hero as a student in the public normal school of a Western city .

		He has come from the farm , has been a country school teacher , and wishes to become a civil engineer .

		Reaching the metropolis , he finds it impossible to get the engineering training he wishes , and is per - suaded by a chance acquaintance to enter the normal school instead .

		From this time on we are entertained by accounts of his experiences with the faculty , of his boarding-house life , and of his surreptitious ac - quaintance with a girl whom he wooes with amazing yuntness .

		As a study of the educational conditions of such an institution as is described , the book has a puzzling interest for us .

		The methods , the rela - tions between teacher and students , the Draconian regulations , are utterly unlike anything we have ever known , and impress us as absolutely antediluvian .

		Yet they are given us in seemingly sober faith , and it is difficult to dispose of them as pure invention .

		Although the school is co-educational , a boy is not permitted to speak to a girl ; and to be seen with one in public , or to be discovered making a social call , is a crime for which ignominious expulsion is the only possible penalty .

		Our hero , of course , who could not otherwise be a hero of fiction , brazenly flouts these restrictive rules , is daring enough to accept a girl 's invitation to call , and commits the crowning audacity of escorting her home from even - ing prayer-meeting .

		From the consequences of this escapade he escapes by the skin of his teeth .

		In the end , he marries her , although not without much intervening tribulation , and we leave him neither engineer nor teacher , but a rising artist in
Paris	LOCATION	, whose latest contribution to the Salon has been the success of the year . ''

		Helpfulness and honesty seem to me the most essential characteristics of the American ... Con - sider the vividness of his religious emotion , his interest in religion and metaphysical science , -- in short , look around everywhere without prejudice , and you can not doubt that behind the terrifying mask of the selfish realist breathes the idealist , who is controlled by a belief in ethical values . ''

		These words of Professor
Mtlnsterberg	PERSON	came to our atten - tion just as we were reading the latest productions of socialist fiction -- Mr.
Jack London	PERSON	's '' The Iron Heel '' and Mr.
Upton Sinclair	PERSON	's '' The Metropolis '' -- and we could not help contrasting the sane and deliberate opinion of the foreign-born critic with the reckless sensationalism of our radical native novel - ists , for '' helpfulness and honesty '' are precisely the two traits which they deny us , -- which , indeed , they are bound to deny us in order to find a basis for their lurid descriptions and their dismal vaticinations .

		To take Mr.
Sinclair	PERSON	first , his book pretends to picture the social and business life of
New York City	LOCATION	, con - cerning which he has diligently informed himself by feeding on the highly seasoned fare daily provided by our most enterprising journalism .

		His method seems to be that of taking at face value the wildest imaginings of the inventive reporter , multiplying by some such number as ten , and piling up the product with cumulative effect .

		For the pm ` pose of impressing us with the sinful extravagance of the predatory rich , he employs the simple expedient of setting down the price of everything mentioned , from a lace handkerchief to a steam yacht .

		By contrast with the warm color thus imparted to the pages , the yellowest of ordinary journalism seems to have no more than a sickly lemon hue .

		It would be ridiculous to take the book seriously as a social study , and it has not even the merit of being a good story .

		Even the possible romance that is hinted at now and then does not materialize , and we close the book with
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 247 the feeling that our time has been wasted upon a very dull tract .

		Mr.
London	LOCATION	's effusion is quite as dull a tract as the other ; it is mainly different because it prophesies an impossible future instead of depicting an unreal present .

		A story has been going around the news - papers to the effect that the author recently signed himself in some guest-book or other as '' Yours for the revolution , '' and that a serious socialist whose name came next added the words , '' There ai n't going to be no revolution . ''

		Really , this is about all there is to say on the subject of '' The Iron Heel '' considered as a thesis .

		Viewed as a product of the imagination , the book is also quite poverty - stricken .

		It describes the earlier stages of the revolution which the author sees coming , and con - siderately lets us know that the outbreak is only one lustrum distant from the present year of grace .

		By that time , the oligarchy will have got possession of pretty nearly everything capable of ownership , and the proletariat , rising in its might -LRB- and its greed -RRB- will begin the process of tjiking it all away .

		The conflict will be very `` bluggy , '' and the author 's imagination riots in its details .

		Various points of the story are enforced by choice footnote citations from our current literature of discontent .

		Of course , such books as this and the one previously discussed have a mischievous influence upon unbalanced minds , and we can not but deplore their multiplication .

		No period of social unrest was ever more in need than the present of temperate discussion of the questions that our rapid material growth has forced upon all men 's minds .

		Conciliation rather than strife , soft - ness rather than bitterness of speech , should be the aims of all who really wish to help our civilization through the stressful years now at hand .

		And our civilization has no worse enemies than those who are engaged in the truly devilish work of fomenting social dissension and arraying class against class .

		It is for this reason , far more than because of their slovenly neglect of the principles of literary work - manship , that we think the two books now under review deserving of the severest condemnation .

		studies of Mr.
Christian Brinton	PERSON	does not state modern painters .

		^ ^ J ^ -RCB- ` f ^ y anywhere in his studies of '' Modern Artists '' -LRB-
Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- what constitutes his idea of modernity and thereby his basis of selection .

		But in general his test seems to be virility of insight and workmanship , a compelling personality , above all the power to paint realities , whether ideal realities like
Watts	PERSON	, rococo realities like
Fragonard	ORGANIZATION	, or the stern reality of toil like
Meunier	PERSON	and
Segantini	PERSON	.

		Of the fourteen artists discussed all are painters ; eleven are still living or have died within the present century ; and all are figure painters , not a single landscape being reproduced among the sixty full-page illustrations .

		These facts cast a little more light on Mr.
Brinton	PERSON	's conception of the modern note in art .

		However , it is not fair to theorize too much about his choices , for he states distinctly that he is not writing to up - hold any particular thesis , but is merely criticizing -- or , to speak more accurately , characterizing -- the work of each artist independently , trying to give a sense of each man 's individuality and of the environ - ment that moulded his work .

		Mr.
Brinton	PERSON	is thus able to approach each painter with open mind and ready sympathy .

		His criticism is interesting in that it seizes so readily upon salient features and phrases its conclusions so forcibly .

		Meunier is the apostle of democracy ;
Whistler	LOCATION	, on the other hand , typifies the inevitable reaction -- '' the principle of aristoc - racy reasserting itself . ''

		Lenbach is '' the rigorous analyst to whom beauty of colour was naught and character was everything , '' while Sargent is `` in no sense a painter of thought , or of feelings other than those which are plainly etched upon the human countenance , '' his whole interest being in texture , form , and shape , -- in the glorification of rich and beautiful externals .

		Such characterizations are dan - gerous of course ; they thrust forward one mood or one set of qualities and ignore others equally necessary to an exact delineation ; but being always crisply stated and copiously illustrated by plates , whose generous number and fine quality are a telling feature of Mr.
Brinton	PERSON	's book , these trenchant , deci - sive judgments will appeal particularly to the novice in art-study .

		It is for such readers , who are interested in interpretative rather than in technical criticism , that '' Modern Artists '' is intended .

		Among popular art books this has the further distinction of discussing several artists -- such as
Wiertz	LOCATION	, the mad Belgian painter ,
Arnold BOcklin	PERSON	,
Rdpin	PERSON	, and
Zuloaga	PERSON	-- whose work is likely to be new to many readers , and yet is of decided interest .

		The emphasis on portrait - ure is also unusual in books of this class .

		Bonapartisni and French liberalism .

		The historical importance which Mr.
H. A. L. Fisher	PERSON	, in his essays on '' Bonapartism '' -LRB-
Oxford Clarendon Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , attributes to
Napoleon	PERSON	's conversations at
St. Helena	LOCATION	, raises questions of great interest .

		He believes that
Napoleon	PERSON	felt the need of harmonizing his life with the '' requirements of French liberal - ism , '' and , to this end , spoke of himself as the representative of the ideas of
1789	DATE	.

		This conten - tion
Napoleon	PERSON	sought to substantiate by dictating , in
1820	DATE	, a constitution for the hypothetical reign of
Napoleon II.	ORGANIZATION	, which should include liberties never conceded by him -- liberty of the press , freedom from administrative tyranny , and parliamentary control .

		He argued that the Empire had always meant peace , although in the search for a firm basis of peace he had continually been baffled by the English .

		In the single essay where this matter is discussed , Mr.
Fisher	PERSON	has not given himself room enough to offer adequate evidence of the influence of these conversations upon the public opinion of 248 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	,
France	LOCATION	.

		He mentions merely the fact that the jom-nalist
Armand Carrel	PERSON	was persuaded by them that
Napoleon	PERSON	was a liberal .

		He appears also to believe that
Louis Napoleon	PERSON	's book on '' Napoleonic Ideas , '' published in
1839	DATE	, had some influence in propagating the legend .

		In a later lecture on the downfall of the
Second Empire	ORGANIZATION	, he remarks that
Napoleon III.	PERSON	, in making the concessions which opened the way for the
Liberal Empire	ORGANIZATION	, was moved , partly at least , by the feeling that he must be con - sistent with what he had set forth as the Napoleonic system .

		The other lectures in the volume , covering the important phases of the subject to the final ruin of Bonapartism in
1870	DATE	, are vigorous and suggestive in grasp of matter and style of treatment .

		This is especially true of the first , which shows wherein the Revolutionary movement was simply a persistence of political habits formed under the Old Regime , and how these tendencies smoothed the road of the master .

		But Mr.
Fisher	PERSON	is mistaken in the view that even the early assemblies contented themselves TV ^ ith fixing the general principles of a legislative measure , leaving to the executive the duty of pro- viding detailed regulations for their application .

		One looks through the columns of Duvergier in vain for evidence of this practice , and discovers , on the contrary , that the Constituent assembly , for example , was constantly encroaching upon executive functions , instead of abandoning any of its proper work to the executive .

		The arousing ^ n experienced Orientalist and a of the Hermit professional psychologist , Dr.
George Kingdom	PERSON	.


Trumbull Ladd	PERSON	, has brought to the study of the Korean people and Korean problems an equipment possessed by no preceding visitor to the
Hermit Kingdom	LOCATION	.

		His book , '' In
Korea	LOCATION	with
Marquis Ito	PERSON	'' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is of course , from its very title , written rather from the Japanese than from the native or the Chinese point of view ; but one can not turn its pages without being impressed by its pains - taking endeavor to be impartial and truthful in every particular .

		It has long been more than sus - pected that the press reports of Japanese high - handedness in
Korea	LOCATION	were greatly exaggerated .


Marquis Ito	PERSON	, Resident-General , finding his adminis - tration greatly hampered and sadly misjudged in consequence of these sensational reports that only reached him , tardily , by way of
England	LOCATION	or
America	LOCATION	, invited Professor
Ladd	PERSON	, in the course of a lecture tour in
Japan	LOCATION	a year ago , to spend some time at
Seoul	LOCATION	as his guest and to aid him in correcting the false impressions made on the public ; and also the American visitor was to exert his influence , in whatever way he might choose , toward promoting more cordial relations between the protected and the protecting country , and toward '' furthering for the
Koreans	LOCATION	themselves the benefits which the exist - ing relations of the two countries made it desirable for both to secure . ''

		In the almost five hundred pages of the book , a full account of Dr.
Ladd	PERSON	's experiences , and a sufiiciently minute description of persons and places not always of savory sweetness , are faithfully given .

		There is also an excursion into the domain of history , and another into the field of prophecy .

		A glimpse at least of the Korean problem is furnished by the following passage from the closing chapter : '' The future of
Korea	LOCATION	and of the Japanese Protectorate over
Korea	LOCATION	will inevitably depend upon the action and reaction of three classes of factors .

		These are the attitude and behavior of other foreign nations ; the native capacity for self - government and the actual conduct of the
Koreans	LOCATION	themselves ; and the policy of
Japan	LOCATION	, not as a theory or an experiment merely , but as embodied in indus - tries , laws , institutions and other forms of practical effect . ''

		The volume is well illustrated , and is in every respect a valuable work of its kind .

		The areat ^ ^ ^ great earthquake of
April , 1906	DATE	,
California	LOCATION	which initiated such destruction in earthquake .

		^ ^ gj ^ y ^ f gg ^ ^ ^ Francisco and the adjoining regions , called forth a great variety of scientific and descriptive writing .

		President
Jordan	PERSON	, of
Stanford University	ORGANIZATION	, has edited a volume con - taining a collection of eight essays , which appears with the title '' The
California	LOCATION	Earthquake of
1906	DATE	'' -LRB-
A. M. Robertson	PERSON	,
San Francisco	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		With one excep - tion the essays have been printed previously , chiefly in scientific journals ; but while written from the scientific point of view , they are invested with a good degree of popular interest .

		Three of the writers are members of the faculty of
Stanford University	ORGANIZATION	, and one is of
the University of California	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dr.
Omori	PERSON	, a member of the
Imperial Earthquake Investigation Committee of Japan	ORGANIZATION	, and the inventor of a widely - used type of earthquake recorder , writes on the cause of the earthquake .

		Professor
Derleth	PERSON	, of the Uni - versity of
California	LOCATION	, occupies one-third of the book in describing the effects of the earth-movements upon structures of various types , and draws some practi - cal conclusions as to the safest ways of building for the future .

		The chief article , from the standpoint of geology , is written by Professor Gilbert of the
U. S. Geological Survey	ORGANIZATION	; five of the other articles are primarily geological in aspect , but distinctly pop - ular in treatment .

		The concluding essay is by Mrs.
Mary Austin	PERSON	, an accomplished magazine writer , who was one of the
San Francisco	LOCATION	victims , and describes the human side of the catastrophe in a graphic and picturesque way .

		The book is illustrated by a hun - dred and twenty - five half-tone plates from photo - graphs showing the scenes of the great disaster .

		An Italian ^ ^ ' ^ ^ '' ^ Borsa 's `` The English critic of the Stage of To-day , '' translated from English stage , ^ jjg Italian by Mr.
Selwyn Brinton	PERSON	and printed at the
Bodley Head	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is an attempt , on the whole a successful one , to analyze present dramatic conditions and possibilities in
England	LOCATION	.

		Incidental references are made to the American stage , and much that applies to
England	LOCATION	applies equally well to this country .

		As might be expected of a
Continental	ORGANIZATION	critic , Dr.
Borsa	PERSON	sees

		THE DIAL 249 much that calls for unqualified condemnation , much that would almost lead a genuine lover of the theatre to despair of its intellectual elevation .

		We must all admit that the theatre has become commercialized as fully as any other business enterprise , and that the financially profitable but artistically ruinous system of '' long runs '' contrasts unfavorably with the more prevalent repertory of the Italian theatres .

		The censor , to the Italian critic , is an unmitigated evil , since the Anglo-Saxon conscience will have none of the plays that may show genius but not morals .

		The worst evil of all , however , is the great British public , '' artless , coarse-minded , dull-witted , '' whose taste has to be pandered to in order that the play may have a run .

		Yet there are encouraging features even on the English stage .

		The work of
Jones	LOCATION	,
Barrie	PERSON	,
Pinero	PERSON	, and
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	shows a marked advance over the rampant dulness of the mid - Victorian period .

		The achievements of the
Stage Society	ORGANIZATION	and of the Court Theatre , which aim at the production of intellectual plays regardless of their commercial value , indicate that there is a strong working minority with ideals and enthusiasm .

		Corresponding to this intellectual minority , there are in
Ireland	LOCATION	the founders of the
Irish National Theatre	ORGANIZATION	, of whom Mr.
W. B. Yeats	PERSON	is chief , who are trying with some success to rehabilitate the '' dim kingdom of the unreal '' in the Celtic past .

		Indeed , the great British public has always been logically doomed by its
Continental	ORGANIZATION	critics to produce a dull and heavy literature , and yet it has somehow man - aged to create a literature which is the despair of these same critics .

		The cause is not yet lost .

		For teachers Professor
Stanley Hall	PERSON	's important and parents of work on Adolescence , an epoch - adolescent youth , marking if not epoch-making book -LRB- reviewed at length in The Dial of
August 16 , 1904	DATE	-RRB- , has been condensed and epitomized by the author into a single volume which appears with the new title '' Youth , its Education , Regimen , and Hygiene '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		It is remarkable how large a proportion of the practically valuable matter of the two large volumes has been packed into the small one .

		Indeed , most teachers and parents would do better to read the smaller than the larger work ; in the latter the uninitiated reader easily loses his orientation , and is confused and misled by the mass of pathological material .

		Some of the most important chapters are those on the Motor Powers ; Plays , Sports , and Games ; Faults , Lies , and Crimes ; The Growth of Social Ideals ; and finally that great declaration of revolt .


Intellectual Education and School Work	ORGANIZATION	.

		It would have been well if some parts of the chapter on Sex Development in the original work had been adapted and included in the shorter volume ; few topics stand more in need of wise and trustworthy popularization .

		It is to be re - gretted that the work was done so much with scissors .

		President
Hall	PERSON	's extraordinary learning and wealth of ideas and expression amount to an actual obstacle in many places in the original work , to all except the expert ; the shorter book is avowedly for the use of a larger public , and yet little has been done to adapt the style and form to this public , beyond the inser - tion of very mechanical foot-notes , sometimes almost naive in their information , and of a glossary like - wise mechanical and not well chosen .

		The constant occurrence of rare and ultra-technical words -- in not a few cases apparently the creation of the author 's scientific imagination and linguistic knowl - edge -- and of long and involved sentences , is a serious defect in the work .

		Nevertheless , it is a world-classic on its subject , and should be read by everyone concerned with the education of youth , especially by high-school teachers and the parents of adolescent children .

		An English ^ ^ ^ point of view of the new English biography biographer of
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	, Mr. of Lincoln .


Henry Bryan Binns	PERSON	, is shown by the quotation from Whitman on his title-page , -- '' The grandest figure yet on all the crowded canvas of the nineteenth century . ''

		Mr.
Binns	PERSON	has done an excel - lent piece of biographical work , having written one of the best-balanced and sanest of the innumerable lives of Lincoln .

		There is evident advantage in his detachment from national and partisan considera - tions ; he has been able to view the discussions and strifes of the antebellum period , and the vexed questions and stirring events of the Civil War , apart from the prejudices derived from the uncritical reading and study that largely shape the opinions of every American youth .

		The result is a biography of moderate compass that represents what in the main must be the final summing up of the man and his work in the annals of the world , the judgment of posterity upon '' the greatest of the popular states - men of the last century , the most notable among the leaders of the English-speaking democracy . ''

		Mr.
Binns	PERSON	has not attempted to hide the earlier unlovely phases of
Lincoln	LOCATION	's life , but has traced his develop - ment out of them into the highest range of states - manship and character .

		The book is one of the `` Temple Biographies , '' published in
London	LOCATION	by Dent and in this country by
E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		An unrivalled The rapidity with which science compendium of ■ , ` ii .

		n. u c ' comparative advances , even in those fields oi m - anatomy .

		vestigation which are already well exploited , is significantly shown in the fact that the treatises on comparative anatomy by Professor
Robert Wiedersheim	PERSON	, of
Freiburg	LOCATION	in
Baden	LOCATION	, have , under several different titles , passed through no less than nine editions since
1882	DATE	.

		A third English edition , based upon the latest German text , has been prepared by Professor
W. N. Parker	PERSON	, with the collaboration of the author , and is published with the title '' Comparative Anatomy of Vertebrates '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It is somewhat abridged from the original German text , and has been again revised by the author .

		It is quite unnecessary to comment upon either the comprehensive scholarship of the author or the skill of the translator ; for both are 250 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, well known in the biological world .

		The work is without a rival in any language , and is unsurpassed as a complete and comprehensive compendium of the more significant facts of comparative anatomy , an indispensable text for college and university use , and a valuable work of reference in the general library .

		The illustrations are very numerous and excellent , though not always executed with the perfection found in the German original .

		This is especially noticeable in the case of those cuts in which color-printing has been employed .

		The size of the page has been somewhat reduced , resulting in a more convenient volume for the library shelf , but crowding the margins beyond the limits of good taste in book-making .

		The translation includes an extensive bibliography of the subject , covering sixty - eight closely set pages ; but even this contains only the titles of the more prominent papers , and by no means all of these .

		It is doubtless an oversight that the '' American Journal of Anatomy '' is omitted from its proper place in these lists .

		Knowledge of ^ ^ t every college professor is so for - the toiar system tunate as to have his class lectures down to date .

		done into a sumptuously printed and excellently illustrated volume , even after suitable revision to adapt them to a wider reading public .

		This has happened to Dr.
C. L. Poor	PERSON	, of
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	, whose book on '' The Solar System '' now fills a niche in
Putnam	LOCATION	's notable '' Science Series . ''

		The work contains a solid substratum of such historical matter regarding the sun and his family of attendant planets as one is accustomed to find in any well-ordered text-book on astronomy .

		To this the author has added the results of a wide reading of the latest researches , so that his treatment of his subject is brought well down to date .

		A special chapter is given to a popular explanation of the ever-puzzling subject of the tides , together with a brief account of Prof.
George H. Darwin	PERSON	's theory of tidal evolution ; but the author is not blind to the fact that many things are likely to happen which will keep this evolutionary process from bearing its full fruitage .

		As the planet Mars just now occupies the centre of the astronomical stage , Dr. Poor has devoted two chapters to it , the second one being a fair-minded though rather destructive criticism of the latest theories concerning the existence of sen - tient life upon its ruddy face .

		Most practical astronomers will agree with the statement -LRB- page 231 -RRB- that `` very little is actually known in regard to the conditions existing on Mars . ''

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Mr.
A. S. E. Ackermann	PERSON	has prepared and the
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	has published a useful and amusing vol - ume entitled '' Popular Fallacies . ''

		In it many of man 's pet beliefs and theories are subjected to searching scientific analysis and proved to be either carelessly mis-stated or utterly false .

		The fallacies disproved are of the most miscellaneous character .

		We are shown that we must no longer believe that a thick tumbler stands hot water better than a thin one , that the color of gpreen tea is produced by drying the leaves on a copper tray , that falling stars are stars falling , that
London	LOCATION	cab - fares are doubled after
midnight	TIME	, or that turning the hands of a watch backwards damages it .

		As the author suggests in his preface , none of his readers can be guilty of believing all the fallacies in the book , and on the other hand no one will fail to find there some of his pet delusions .

		``
Bradford	PERSON	's History of
Plymouth	LOCATION	Plantation '' has just been added to the '' Original Narratives of Early American History '' published by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		It is the sixth volume in that invalu - able collection of reprints , and has been edited by the late
William T. Davis	PERSON	, of
Plymouth	LOCATION	, who died a few months ago at the age of eighty-five , having nearly completed the task of seeing the book through the press . ''

		Winthrop 's Journal , '' in two volumes , is also soon to appear in this series .

		It seems curious , considering the prestige of
Vasari	PERSON	's `` Lives of the Painters , '' that the technical Introduction to the '' Lives '' should have escaped translation into English until now .

		Miss
Louisa S. Maclehose	PERSON	is respon - sible for the first English version , for which Professor
G. Baldwin Brown	PERSON	furnishes notes and an interesting preface .

		The volume , which is a thick octavo , lavishly illustrated , is published by
Messrs. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		under the title ''
Vasari	PERSON	on Technique . ''


Vasari	PERSON	's text , which is divided into three parts , headed respectively Architecture , Sculpture , and Painting , consists in large part of practical directions about artistic materials and processes , intended for the enlightenment of both the craftsman and the lay reader .

		A text-book of `` Physiography for High Schools , '' by Professor
RoUin D. Salisbury	PERSON	, is published by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	in the ''
American Science Series	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Professor
Freeman	PERSON	used to say that the way to write a small book was to begin with a large book upon the same subject , and the opinion was undoubtedly sound .

		Professor
Salisbury	PERSON	has thus qualified in the present instance by his share in the great three-volume `` Geology '' of Messrs.
Chamberlin	PERSON	and
Salisbury	PERSON	, as well as by his own large '' Physiography . ''

		Not that the present volume is a very small one , but only in compar - ison with its huge predecessors .

		It seems to us to be a very good book indeed , admirably fitted to the needs of advanced students in high schools , and richly illustrated in the most attractive manner .

		Mr.
Ernest H. Short	PERSON	's `` History of Sculpture '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- is avowedly written for a purpose .

		Mr.
Short	PERSON	believes that true art is always the expression and interpretation of national life , the individual artist being '' no more than the crest of a wave in the sea of mental , emotional , and physical energy whence art arises . ''

		As a backgroimd for an intelligent imder - standing of the sculpture of any age one must have , then , an idea of its temper and tendencies .

		Such conceptions Mr.
Short	PERSON	endeavors to supply in brief historical summaries and characterizations ; and by thus showing that beautiful marbles and bronzes have a vital relation to life , he hopes to arouse an interest in sculpture as a living art .

		His book covers the entire ground from the rise of the sculptor 's art in
Greece	LOCATION	through the work of the French and British schools of the nineteenth century .

		Few biographical data are given , and attention is paid only to the most character - istic works of each artist .

		BRIEFER MENTION 280 NOTES 281 TOPICS IN LEADING PERIODICALS ... 282 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 283 THi : IRONY OF
AMEBIC A. Foreign	ORGANIZATION	critics of American life are often instructive , and usually amusing : the extent to which they exhibit both of these qualities is happily exemplified in the series of articles now being written from month to month for '' The Chautauquan '' by Mr.
John Graham Brooks	PERSON	.

		The writer has made a diligent study of
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean comment upon
America	LOCATION	, from the old days of '' a certain condescension '' to the modern days of gasping bewilderment and fantastic depiction , and in a collection of characteristic passages , skil - fully chosen and grouped , has given us a com - posite panorama of foreign opinion which is worthy of our most serious attention .

		No other of our current magazines is at present doing any - thing quite so interesting as this ; the special merits of the work being its candor , its will - ingness to accept legitimate criticism without resentment , and its broadly philosophical out - look .

		Most writers who report upon the views of foreigners concerning our life are actuated by the motive of national self - laudation , more or less concealed ; they either reproduce words of praise , that we may swell with pride when we read them , or they repeat the condemnation of the censori - ous , that the reaction from ruffled sensibilities may heighten our sense of self-esteem .

		Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	does nothing of this sort .

		He is con - cerned only with the truth , and is objective enough to accept it , even when it is presented in unpalatable shape .

		It is only in passing , however , that we men - tion this series of contributions to our self - knowledge gained by reflection from the con - sciousness of outsiders .

		Our special text is found in what a recent English visitor , Mr.
Charles Whibley	PERSON	, has to say about American literature in the pages of ''
Blackwood	PERSON	's
Maga	PERSON	- zine . ''

		The text runs as follows : '' This , then , is the irony of
America	LOCATION	, that the country which has a natural dislike of the past still dances to the ancient tunes , that the country which has invented so much has not invented a new method of expression , that the country which questions aU things accepts its literature in simple faith . ''

		Now this proposition , with the concomitant one that '' from the first the writers of
America	LOCATION	have lagged honorably behind their age , '' is substan - tially true , although it may be expressed in ways 262 THE DIAL .

		-LSB- Mayl , either pleasing or offensive , according to one 's prejudice .

		Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	, for example , ex - pressed it offensively when he said that our poets were either mocking-birds or corn-crakes , either imitative or unmelodious .

		Mr.
Whibley	PERSON	does not express it offensively , but sees in it only a curious conservatism .

		He doubtless got the idea from Mr.
Barrett Wendell	PERSON	, who may be said to have patented it , and the obligation might suitably have been recognized .

		The author takes
Emerson	PERSON	,
Poe	PERSON	, and
Parkman	PERSON	as typical illustrations of his thesis .

		Emerson was in theory '' an anarch who flouted the con - ventions of art and life . ''

		But when he took pen in hand '' he instantly became the slave of all the periods which he despised . ''

		It was Poe '' who most eloquently preached the gospel of style , '' and his was necessarily the style that had been shaped by centuries of English tradi - tion .

		Parkman wrote of
American Indians	ORGANIZATION	in the language of English classicism , and such a phrase as '' the pampered Sardanapalus of
Versailles	LOCATION	'' he evidently gets straight from
Gibbon	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	and Mr.
James	PERSON	, though their material be new , are `` links in the central chain of our tradition , and in speech , if not in thought , are sternly conservative . ''

		And Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	's '' American Anthology '' exhibits some hundreds of poets , most of whom '' compose their verses with a diffident neatness which recalls the Latin style of classical scholars , '' and which '' illustrates the temper not of a young but of a very old people . ''

		All this is fairly obvious , and the point hardly needs to be labored so much .

		Men change their skies but not their souls when they cross the seas , and it is not surprising that transplanted Englishmen should have remained Englishmen even after taking root in the new soil .

		LangTiage is quite as deep-seated a thing as any physical characteristic , and literary tradi - tion is inseparably bound up with inherited speech .

		Mr.
Whibley	PERSON	simply recognizes this indubitable truth , and examines our literature in its light .

		It is well that English writers should do this from time to time , since there has always been a tendency among our kin beyond sea to look for the eccentric and bizarre in our literary output , and to acclaim it as peculiarly American by reason of its very diver - gence from normal English standards .

		The cases of Whitman and ''
Mark Twain	PERSON	'' at once occur , but the writer does not find them serious stumbling-blocks .

		The former '' represented
America	LOCATION	as little as he echoed the voice of the people , '' and the latter , despite his undeniable nationality , has a style and imagination '' of universal truth and application . ''

		Something like a reasonable argument for the existence of a distinctively American manner in literary production may doubtless be based upon the variety of our writings reflective of local con - ditions . ''

		Every province has its coterie , every county its school .

		The whole continent is pegged out in well-acknowledged claims .

		Boston culti - vates one style ,
Chicago	LOCATION	another .

		Each comer makes the most of its own material , and cheer - fully discovers to the other states its character and temperament .

		The result is of great and varied interest .

		The social history of
America	LOCATION	is being written piecemeal , and written often with a skiU and sincerity which merit the high - est praise . ''

		Thus far Mr.
Whibley	PERSON	, who admits this exception to his main proposition , and takes the argument for possibly more than it is worth .

		For , after all , the same sort of thing is being done in
England	LOCATION	, where the latest writers exploit local conditions with equal zeal to leave no aspect of modern life untouched .

		And all these writers , both English and American , employ the rich and flexible speech which is their common inherit - ance , and which has for not the least important of its qualities a generous hospitality for the new locutions with which the needs of new occasions may enrich it .

		The only thing that seems to us particularly worth saying about our more recent American literature , as distinguished from that of our earlier generation , is that it has caught up , or nearly so , with the development of the purest stock .

		We no longer write like the English contemporaries of our grandfathers , but mutatis mutandis ^ like our English fellow - craftsmen of to-day .

		But we are as far as ever from being American in whatever concerns fun - damental form of expression or the deeper ideal - ism of the race , or , indeed , in aught save the accidents of our subject-matter .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		The literary style of men of action , when these men have a style of their own , probably owes its excel - lence largely to the lack of that self-consciousness , that painful striving for effect , which mars the utterances of men of letters .

		`` The mere writer , '' says the
London	LOCATION	'' Spectator '' in a late instructive article , '' who must , like a silkworm , spin out his precious material from inside him , can hardly hope to rival the man of genius whose imagination has been quickened and whose tongue has been loosened by what
Burke	PERSON	calls the ` overmas - tering necessities ' of events . ''

		The men who make writing a profession are commonly the men who do not do things to write about , as
Walter Bagehot	PERSON	used to
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 263 complain ; and , he might have added , the men who do things are usually too modest to write about them .

		But luckily some men of signal achievement have , on occasion , put pen to paper , with unmistakable effect .

		The '' Spectator '' cites , among other instances ,
Walter Ealeigh	PERSON	, Queen
Elizabeth	PERSON	,
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	,
Oliver Cromwell	PERSON	.

		In all American prose literature what pro- duction is there , of equal brevity , to compare with
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's
Gettysburg	LOCATION	address ?

		Every sentence is per - fect , each word is the right one and in the right place .

		What a ready mastery , too , Grant had of clear and vigorous English ! ''

		I propose to fight it out on this line , if it takes all
summer	DATE	, '' has become classic .


Washington	LOCATION	's stately style was , like his personality , impressive ; and a few of his sentences have impressed themselves permanently in the memory .

		Perhaps the most familiar one , though often misquoted , is this from the '' Farewell Address '' : '' 'T is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world . ''

		Mr.
Cleveland	PERSON	, in his presidency , wrote some messages containing here and there a sentence or a phrase that , by virtue of the antiseptic of style , will not soon perish . ''

		Innocuous desuetude '' and '' It is a condition which confronts us -- not a theory '' have proved so useful that we wonder how we got along so many years without these expressions .

		It is excellent , as
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	says , to be the first quoter of a good sen - tence ; but how much better to be its originator !

		■ > • How NOT TO BECOME A FICTION-TOPER is a question that troubles few if any novel-readers ; but to the libra - rian , and especially to the assistant in charge of the children 's room of the library , the problem takes on a serious interest and has caused , first and last , many hours of thoughtful study .

		The
Dayton Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, in its last annual report , announces some rather creditable results of a seemingly wise oversight exercised in the purchase and circulation of novels .

		The wisdom and the inoffensiveness of the course followed are to be in - ferred from the librarian 's own account of the methods pursued .

		Little more than half of the circulation has been fiction , whereas in many admirably conducted libra - ries that we know of in commimities of intellect and culture the demand for novels amounts to nearly three - quarters of the total book demand .

		In
Dayton	LOCATION	, we learn , the circulation of fiction '' has been lowest at the points of closest supervision , the schoolrooms , and highest at the branch libraries .

		The character of the reading in the main Library 's children 's room is being closely watched and improved by the children 's librarian as she is given opportunity for advice and assistance in the selection of books .

		The term * fiction ' in our report includes all standard authors , as well as modern fiction , no novels being classed as ' literature ' in our statistics . ''

		New novels are sparingly bought , but those that seem worthy of purchase are supplied in generous duplication .

		In literary tone , if one may so express it , the Daytonians are being elevated by these and other wise measiires for nursing an interest in the less ephemeral products of the press .

		A CURIOSITY - AROUSING ANONYMITY -- that of the gifted author of '' Confessio Medici , '' commended by us in an earlier issue -- is revealed , not only by internal and other evidence , but also by a confirmatory report from
England	LOCATION	, which declares the nameless writer to be Dr.
Stephen Paget	PERSON	, an eminent
London	LOCATION	physician and son of the late Sir
James Paget	PERSON	, who attained fame in his calling , was appointed surgeon to royalty , and left writ - ings and addresses having a wider scope than medicine .

		Some of these were , not many years ago , edited for pub - lication by the son , who is also known in literature for various original productions .

		To prove -LRB- if proof be asked for -RRB- that as an essayist the younger
Paget	PERSON	is not un - worthy of his parentage , it may not come amiss to quote a characteristic passage from the '' Confessio . ''

		In the chapter entitled '' An Essay for Students '' -LRB- and , by the way .

		Dr.
Stephen Paget	PERSON	has already published a book called '' Essays for Students '' -RRB- the writer handles the subject of psychology in a light and graceful and enter - taining manner .

		Finding himself unable to regard the mind or soul as simply a succession of states of con - sciousness , which is all that psychology can make of it , he has this to say about psychical research : `` We mean by it , mostly , a patient , critical , dispassionate enquiry into stories of ghosts , haunted houses , premonitions , thought-transference , and so forth .

		But I would rather , here , be passionate than dispassionate .

		The enquiry touches me too nearly ; Psyche is on her trial ; it is a matter of her life or death .

		I do not see the good of researching into Psyche without believing in her .

		If a man believes that she is a succession of states of con - sciousness , without anybody there to be conscious that these states are successive , his researches will be as vague -- it is an old simile -- as a blind man looking in a dark room for a black hat that is not in the room .

		I believe that
Psyche	ORGANIZATION	may call to Psyche : but I do not believe that a succession , which is a word , not a thing , can call to another succession , or do anything , or be anything .

		I could as well imagine two calling to two , begging it to come and make four . ''

		• • • The reality of `` the real Doone-Land '' is some - thing not easy to escape , if viewed through the eyes of Mr.
H. Snowden Ward	PERSON	, editor of the new ''
Lorna Doone	PERSON	. ''

		In a current magazine article from his pen , touching on some phases of his editorial task , he recog - nizes the likelihood that his illustrations to the book will arouse queries as to the actual location of the scenes depicted . ''

		And these queries , '' he adds , '' seemed to be followed naturally by others , with reference to the persons and the plot of the story .

		How much of the tale was founded on fact , how much drawn from local tradition , how much woven from the author 's imagina - tion ?

		Again , was there ever a gang of Doone robbers , was there ever a ' girt '
Jan Ridd	PERSON	, and did a delicate dainty
Lorna	PERSON	really sigh and shudder and suffer as the prisoner-princess of a lawless band ? '' ''

		These ques - tions , '' he replies , '' gave excuse for some delightful work .

		What a pity that the reader can not find in the answers a tithe of the pleasure that my wife and I found in the search !

		The Doones of history have been traced , and while they still baffle us at certain points , it seems possible that if a reissue of the book is demanded , we may be able to bring the matter still further up to date . ''

		He then relates his success in tracing the originals of some of the characters -- but not of
Lorna	LOCATION	herself , unluckily -- and says that in identifying places he has been fairly fortunate .

		Those readers who are moved to visit these places will find , he is confident , '' in addi - tion to the scenery , something of which we can give but little indication in the book .

		They will find a frank , hearty , hospitable , plain-spoken people ; they will realize that
Blackmore	PERSON	's folk were drawn from life , and they will leave the land and the people -- if they have stayed long enough to really know them -- with an earnest wish to return often and to stay long . ''

		264 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, A STUDY IN '' LETTERED EASE '' is fuTiiished , free , at any large public library reading-room , where many and varied are the types of those occupants of literary chairs who come early , stay late , and rarely take a vacation .

		One of the oddest specimens ever encountered was an old fellow at the British Museum described by
David Masson	PERSON	in his posthumous '' Memories of
London	LOCATION	in the ` Forties , '' which his daughter is editing for serial publi - cation .

		`` Having sent in his tickets , '' says
Milton	PERSON	's biographer , condescending to a study of a much less illustrious man of letters , '' he sat for a while quite idle , waiting for his books .

		They came at last , a very con - siderable pile ; and then he began operations .

		First he put his hat between his knees , adjusting it carefully so as to receive something ; then putting his right hand into his coat-pocket behind , he fetched thence a red handkerchief and two eggs .

		Under the mask of the wall of books in front of him , he proceeded to chip one of the eggs .

		That it was raw was more obvious than pleasant ; but , by tilting his head back , and an act of suction more visible than audible , he contrived to swallow the contents , dropping the shell furtively , when he had done so , into his open hat .

		He immediately performed the same process with the other egg ; after which , as no third egg seemed to be forthcoming , I thought the entertainment over , and drew my eyes ofE him to attend to my own work .

		When I looked again , about ten minutes later , he was fast asleep , his head nodding over the hat , into which he had dropped the red pocket-handkerchief to conceal the two egg-shells , -- and not a volume of the wall of books before him so much as opened !

		Very possibly he was a philosopher ; but he must have been of some deep and peculiar school , -- investigating things ab ovo . ''

		• • • The opiophagia of
Thomas De Quincey	PERSON	, which has given us one of the most famous and most widely read of our English classics , may turn out to be , after all , largely a matter of that tantalizing and incompre - hensible writer 's vivid imagination .

		The world has long believed that opium was De Quincey 's peculiar and dis - tinctive '' tipple , '' but now comes forward a French savant , Dr.
Guerrier	PERSON	, and avers that the English essayist was a veritable
Miinchausen	PERSON	in his professed record of opium-eating . ''

		The use of opium , '' says the French specialist , '' in large doses and during a long period quickly produces great weakness and premature old age . ''

		Now De Quincey lived until he was seventy-three .

		At seventy he still covered with light step ten miles or so on foot .

		A friend reports that he climbed the hill - sides like a squirrel .

		Opium also destroys the memory .

		That of De Quincey remained perfect until his death .

		We have sought to show that the opiophagia of
Thomas DeQuincey	PERSON	lies in the realm of legend .

		... If he took opium at all , it must have been very little . ''

		Many readers must have felt the unconvincing quality of the Opium-Eater 's voluble and brilliantly rhetorical '' Con - fessions , '' just as one must , even with the best intentions , refuse to melt with pity for
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's dyspepsia and insomnia -- he turns them too readily and with too much artistic satisfaction to literary use .

		Mrs.
Glyn	PERSON	's cheerful charm is reflected in the pages of the
April	DATE	'' Book Monthly , '' which publishes an interview with her on her return from her first American visit and before her departure for a repetition of the pleasant experience .

		Asked whether our country was not clothed in gloom as a result of the financial panic , she replied : '' Well , the papers have said so , but I was in
America	LOCATION	during the crisis and I did not come upon any signs of distress .

		When I landed at
New York	LOCATION	its air of prosperity just stared at me , and it was there -- or so 1 thought -- when I came away .

		Perhaps it will be there on my return , for it may be that a young coun - try cries out louder when anything happens to it , ill or well , than an older one . ''

		As one evidence , and to her a gratifying evidence , of this country 's solvency , the English visitor might have added that two hundred thou - sand copies of her much-discussed '' Three Weeks '' have here found eager buyers .

		Of this book the interviewer reports her as saying that , whereas she wrote '' The Visits of Elizabeth '' for fun , to amuse herself , and might never have published it had not Lady
Warwick	PERSON	seen the man - uscript and urged its publication , in the later story she `` tried to write a book that should be a real human study -- a study in love as a trinity .

		The hero and heroine of it are types of human nature , and so are they presented .

		What is the art of fiction-writing but the art , so far as one may succeed in it , of reflecting life , not as we would like it to be , but as it actually is in some phase or other . ''

		Indisputably true ; and just because life '' actually is '' never precisely the same thing to any two novelists -LRB- or to any two persons of any calling , for that matter -RRB- it offers such limitless possibilities for the worker in any branch of art who essays to portray its lineaments .

		... The homely charm of
Hans Christian Ander	PERSON	- sen will never lose its power over children and over adults with an unspoilt taste for innocent delights .

		It was a fitting tribute to the entertainer who has cheered and brightened so many homes , that his own childhood 's home , at
Odense	ORGANIZATION	in
Denmark	LOCATION	, should be set apart as a permanent memorial , and as a sort of illustration and commentary to his tales .

		Of that one-roomed little house , with its roof - garden , he himself has written : '' The walls , however , were covered with pictures , and over the workbench was a cupboard containing books and songs .

		The little kitchen was full of shining plates and metal pans , and by means of a ladder it was possible to go out on the roof , where , in the gutters between it and the neighbor 's house , there stood a great chest filled with soil , my mother 's sole garden , where she grew her vegetables .

		In my story of < The Snow Queen ' that garden still blooms .

		Green branches ... ornamented our little room , which my mother always kept neat and clean ; she took great pride in always having the bed linen and curtains very white . ''

		One likes to remember , among other incidents of that childhood , that little
Hans	PERSON	used to take long rambles in the woods with his dreamy father , who would beguile the time by reading aloud from the '' Arabian Nights '' or from a dramatic poet , while his child threaded wild strawberries on slender grass - stalks .

		It was on the
second of April	DATE	, the hundred and third anniversary of
Andersen	PERSON	's birth , that the house in which he was bom was opened to the public .

		An awakening of interest in Thibetan litera - ture is recognized and encouraged by recent action on the part of the trustees of the
Newberry Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		A generous appropriation has been made for securing a collection of books and kindred material having to do with the life and literature of this little-known land .

		In the latest Newberry Library Report we read : '' This work has been undertaken in connection with the
Field Museum of Natural History	ORGANIZATION	, whose Assistant Curator of Asiatic Ethnology -- Dr.
Berthold Lauf	PERSON	er -- has already
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 265 been dispatched on this errand .

		For the
Field Museum	ORGANIZATION	he will conduct investigation and the purchase of a collection which will illustrate the ethnology of Thibet .

		For the
Newberry Library	ORGANIZATION	he will gather a library of Thibetan literature , which associates itself with the literature of
China	LOCATION	,
Korea	LOCATION	,
Mongolia	LOCATION	, and
Japan	LOCATION	.

		The recent marvellous development of these countries and their connection with our own country has created a demand for whatever can be obtained of authentic value , from original sources , relating to the thought , religion , history , government , and life of these nations . ''

		Only three collections -- in
London	LOCATION	,
Berlin	LOCATION	, and
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	-- similar to this in process of acquisition for
Chicago	LOCATION	, are in existence .

		The proposed addition to the
Newberry Library	ORGANIZATION	's resources , taken in connection with the recent purchase of the
Wilberforce Fames	ORGANIZATION	collection of works on the philology of the various nations of
India	LOCATION	, will make the library noticeably strong in Asiatic languages and literature .

		• • • The librarian 's interest in bacteriology takes on a very practical complexion when , as last year in
Portland	LOCATION	,
Oregon	LOCATION	, a contagious disease spreads widely among the library 's patrons .

		The unpleasant experience of
Portland	LOCATION	may be turned to profit in other places by pondering Miss
Isom	PERSON	's report of what was done and what was left imdone in the library under her care .

		Speaking of the spinal meningitis epidemic that afflicted her city a year ago , she says : '' At the height of the epidemic the
Health Officer	ORGANIZATION	ordered the Library closed , and for two days the building and books were thoroughly fumigated with formaldehyde gas .

		The 7,500 volumes which were in circulation at the time were fumigated nightly on their return to the Library , a process extend - ing over four weeks .

		All this was so disagreeable and so alarming that it looked for a time as though confi - dence would never be restored and the Library resimie its customary activity . ''

		Feeling that these elaborate precautions might have been imnecessary or ill-advised , the authorities sought the counsel of many librarians and some bacteriologists , and finally reached the con - clusion '' that it is better to destroy books where they have been exposed to contagious diseases , and that vapors from formaldehyde will not sterilize books stacked on shelves . ''

		Of course all this experience was purchased at the expense of a sad falling-off in the annual circula - tion -- a sore loss to the ambitious librarian .

		9 • • A rotating librarianship , one , that is , to which is applied the principle of rotation in public office , is a sight to arouse a sort of sad and bitter amusement .

		The retiring
State Librarian of Maryland	ORGANIZATION	, in her letter of -LRB- enforced -RRB- resignation , indulges in some pardonably plain speaking to the Governor , who , by the way , is said to have selected a pretty young kinswoman of his own to fill the newly-created vacancy .

		We append a few sentences from the retiring official 's letter .

		Her Parthian arrow is well aimed , well pointed , and properly barbed . ''

		Referring to the paragraph of your letter in which you say that there are < so many applicants of sterling qiiali - ties , efficiency and good party record , ' I must say that I can not see how the appointment of another woman , and one without training or experience in library work , satisfies the requirements of the phrase quoted .

		For twelve years the
State Library	ORGANIZATION	has been ' out of politics , ' and my application for reappointment was based on experience , efficiency and faithful service .

		Many States are now alive to the fact that rotation in office is more detrimental to the interests of
State	ORGANIZATION	libraries than to any other department of government , and , hence , the tendency now is to make the tenure of office dependent solely on the qualifications of the incumbent without any regard to the ' good of the party . ' ''

		The new libra - rian 's professional experience appears to be an unknown if not a negative quantity .

		• • • The public library 's rental shelves , where are to be had the latest officially approved popular novels , in a sufficient number of copies , at a small daily charge , are not yet to be found in many places ; but even now , with the system in its tentative stage , objections have been raised to it .

		Four of these are answered by Miss
Corinne Bacon	PERSON	, of the
New York State Library School	ORGANIZATION	, in the
April	DATE	number of '' New York Libraries . ''

		To the charge of illegality she replies that , as no test of this has ever been made in court , the objection is purely speculative .

		The assertion that to receive payment for the use of public-library books is contrary to the public - library spirit , is answered by citing the analogy of the public museum 's special pay-day , and of the rented towel in the public bath .

		The claim that the rental system swells the fiction figures in the circulation statistics is dismissed as unproved , while even if it were established it would mean that novels sanctioned by a responsible board of examiners are read rather than , in all proba - bility , works of inferior excellence obtainable elsewhere .

		Finally , to the objection that the system discriminates in favor of those who can afford to pay for their reading , it is pointed out that the library always owns at least one free copy of every book on the pay shelves , and this free copy is rendered more easily available for the im - pecunious applicant by reason of its presence , in duplicate or triplicate , in the rental case .

		• • • Bookselling and book-renting are often carried on side by side and under the same management , shop-worn or soiled or second-hand books being relegated to the loan department of the business ; but in a
Philadelphia	LOCATION	bookstore an attractive modification or reversal of this plan is in operation .

		On shelves accessible to the public there has been placed an inviting array of new novels , in alphabetical order , and from this supply of fresh , clean '' best-sellers '' -LRB- and best-lenders -RRB- any person of good credit may borrow such volume or volumes as he desires at
two cents	MONEY	a day for each , the minimum charge on each book thus loaned being
six cents	MONEY	, or a three-days ' rental .

		With the first appearance of dog 's - ears and thumb-prints a book is transferred to the hurt-book counter , there to await a buyer , and a fresh copy takes its place on the loan-shelves if the demand for it still continues .

		To the contemplative observer there might seem to be here an interesting possibility of such another lively book-battle as the celebrated
London	LOCATION	`` Times '' contest now known to all the world ; but let us hope the peaceful
Quaker City	ORGANIZATION	may not thus be turned into a battle-ground resounding with the din of trade strife and reeking with the flow of ineffectual ink .

		• • • The inviolability of authors ' manuscript has recently been made the subject of legal discussion in a
Brooklyn	LOCATION	court .

		A publishing house has '' edited '' a writer 's sheets with what seemed to him unwarrantable freedom , and he has sued for damages .

		The testimony elicited from various prominent editors and publishers , in the trial of the case , seems to be overwhelmingly in favor of the plaintiff .

		Mr.
Richard Watson Gilder	PERSON	, for 266 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, instance , deponed that `` adding without consent new matter to an article is inadmissible , and there is no custom in the publishing trade by which an editor of a magazine may add to articles purchased by him without the con - sent of the author thereof ; but , on the contrary , it is the custom not to change , add to , or alter such articles except with the consent of the author and upon the submission of proof sheets thereof to said author . ''

		Mr.
George Haven Putnam	PERSON	, Mr.
Henry Holt	PERSON	, and other pub - lishers testified to like effect .

		Mr.
Holt	PERSON	's statement was that '' during all his experience he had never heard of any custom justifying an editor or publisher in add - ing to any matter issued by him under the name of another person without the consent of such person ; or even in subtracting from it in essentials , though trifling abbreviations not changing the sense are admissible where it is necessary to bring the matter within defined limits . ''

		.

		, .

		The fate of an author 's manuscript is some - times such as might move to tears , sometimes to laughter , and sometimes to philosophic reflection on the uncertainty of all things human .

		A manuscript of
Ouida	LOCATION	's is said to have been slumbering in the dusty seclusion of a
London	LOCATION	publisher 's pigeon-hole for the past year or two , while its author was tasting the bitter - ness of poverty and loneliness .

		Whether the manuscript was paid for before it was pigeon-holed does not appear .

		We may hope it was , since it is the practice of many large publishing houses to purchase '' copy '' far in advance of their immediate needs .

		A
New York	LOCATION	firm , in a recent accounting of stock , discovered more than five hundred pieces of literary ware , paid for and awaiting publication -- some of them had been waiting half a century , and many were from famous pens .

		But by no means all of them were found to have possessed life enough to keep them sweet ; and so the mouldy stock had to go into the dust-bin , however illustrious the name it bore .

		, , , English as the language of literature and SCIENCE , as also the medium of oral and epistolary communication , is daily making fresh conquests .

		The use of their own tongue on the part of
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	pro- fessors visiting German universities to lecture -LRB- whereas the
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	professors hold forth in Grerman -RRB- is perhaps not unconnected , in a causal relation , with the announcement that henceforth the upper classes of the Grerman Latin schools will be permitted to substitute English for French in the modern language require - ments .

		This can not , of course , mean that required French is to be dropped altogether ; but , whatever the exact nature of the change , it marks , in the opinion of Professor
Schofield	PERSON	, just home from his lectureship abroa 'd , '' the passing of French as the one essential language of a public man in
Germany	LOCATION	. ''

		Li fact , he is quoted as attributing this new development to the inter - change of German and American lecturers , and also to the growth of commercial relations between the two coimtries .

		... The coming Tolstoi festival , the celebration of the venerable Russian 's eightieth birthday next
August	DATE	, will be an event of very different significance to differ - ent persons .

		While some are hailing
Tolstoi	PERSON	the novelist , the author of '' War and Peace '' and ''
Anna Kar	PERSON	^ nina , '' others will lift worshipful eyes to Tolstoi the prophet and the social reformer , the utterer of '' My Confession , '' '' What is to be Done ? ''

		and '' The Kingdom of God is within You '' ; and whether these two classes of admirers can be made to agree on any suitable and symmetrical programme of proceedings for the honoring of so dis - tinctly a double personality , is a question that may excite some disturbing doubts .

		The child 's fatherhood of the man was never less apparent than in the develop - ment of this remarkable and variedly forceful character .

		The real and enduring worth of
Count Tolstoi	LOCATION	to the world in which he has so long and so conspicuously played his chosen part -LRB- or parts , rather -RRB- will perhaps be more accurately determined in the course of the next few months ' inevitable reviews and discussions of his life and works .

		, , ,
State	ORGANIZATION	publications are not , as a rule , the most attractive of literature , if indeed they deserve to be called literature at all .

		They do not even form a part of that stately company of books which no gentleman 's library should be without -- and which no gentleman would ever dream of reading .

		But the ''
New Jersey State Publications on History	ORGANIZATION	, Geology , Geography , Climate , Resources , Industries and Other Topics , '' as brought to our attention in a little pamphlet prepared by Miss
Mary E. Fannan	PERSON	, and issued by the
Newark Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, have at least the merit of variety in their wide range of topics , and are believed to be desir - able acquisitions for public libraries .

		Those libraries that are so fortunate as to be within the
State of New Jersey	ORGANIZATION	can obtain these publications free of charge .

		The man with the composing stick , a meritorious and voluminoils contributor to literature , but always modestly anonymous , and not seldom the object of petu - lant faultfinding , which is often wholly undeserved , must many times have figured , vaguely , elusively , enveloped in a nimbus of obscurity , to the reader 's , and still more to the writer 's , imagination .

		That he is a worthy per - sonage , entitled to our kindly consideration , is probably the general feeling ; and consequently there will be gen - eral satisfaction in learning that his intellectual needs are to be looked out for , more carefully than hitherto , by a correspondence school established by the
Inter	ORGANIZATION	- national
Typographical Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		Full information may be had from the
I. T. U. Commission	ORGANIZATION	, 120 Sherman Street ,
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		...
Missouri	LOCATION	's awakening to her library needs is testified to by her `` First Annual Report of the
Missouri Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	, '' which has just appeared , and which presents the results of one year 's zealous labor for the cause of good literature in that great but not yet enthusiastically literature-loving
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Com - mission has given much attention to travelling libraries -- those precursors of the stationary library -- and issues a separate booklet on '' Traveling Libraries : What they are and how to secure them . ''

		From the
Commission	ORGANIZATION	's table of statistics it appears that the whole State can boast of but twenty-two public libraries .

		• • • A commercially valuable assonance appears to be responsible for the present demand in the book - market for ''
Edwin Drood	PERSON	. ''

		The great public -- the gullible public , as it so loves to prove itself -- confused
Drood	PERSON	and
Druce	PERSON	, despite the faultiness of the asso - nance , and straightway clamored for
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	's unfinished romance as being based on the
Druce	PERSON	mystery .

		The newspapers spread the hoax , the booksellers cheerfully encouraged it , and a wide circle of readers embraced the opportunity to become acquainted with , or to renew their acquaintance with , an English classic .

		An
American Historian	ORGANIZATION	and Diplomat .

		* The publication of the first authentic biog - raphy of a man who has worthily served his country in affairs or letters is an important con - tribution to the literature of any period .

		When the subject of the biography has been promi - nently identified with both political and literary history , the popular interest is increased .

		If the biographer has been able to give a complete life-record , the results of both search and sifting , the reader feels gratitude as well as intellectual gratification .

		Such sentiments will occur to nearly all readers of the long awaited and now just published '' Life and Letters of
George Bancroft	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
M. A. De Wolfe Howe	PERSON	.

		From the varied forms of biographic treat - ment the author has combined those of chronicler and interpreter .

		During the recital of significant events in the life of
Bancroft	LOCATION	and the nation , he keeps in the background , allowing letters to tell their own graphic story , and supplying only an occasional explanation in brief paragraph or footnote .

		In a final chapter of `` Conclusions '' he comes forward and speaks an epilogue of well-balanced judgment upon certain phases of his subject .

		Mr.
Howe	PERSON	's scholarly interest was enhanced by motives of friendship ; a few years ago he was entrusted by Mrs.
John C. Bancroft	PERSON	with papers and letters collected as a nucleus for the present biography .

		These have been used with sympathetic candor and reverence , and have been supplemented by other records , reminiscences , and letters , forming two volumes of convenient size and attractive form .

		The tone throughout is serious and dignified ; there are several anecdotes and impressions of famous persons of
America	LOCATION	and
Europe	LOCATION	, but the anec - dotal quality is never pronounced .

		Mr.
Howe	PERSON	evidently believes , with Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	, that '' a wise biographer has a higher aim than a collection of after-dinner stories . ''

		The interest , and often the style , of Mr.
Howe	PERSON	's volumes suffers from unevenness ; cer - tain portions have a power of absorbing the reader , while other pages seem colorless .

		This fault may be due largely to the development of
Bancroft	LOCATION	's life and the scanty records of the earlier years .

		His personality gained steadily in attractiveness and service , culminating in an * The Life and
Letters of George Bancroft	ORGANIZATION	.

		old age of mellowness and remarkable activity .

		The biographer , has summarized this fact in his last sentence , -- '' The slope was upward to the end . ''

		He has fittingly lingered over the political and diplomatic experiences of
Bancroft	LOCATION	, who , although never ranked among our great statesmen , was a national character , and a maker as weU as a writer of history .

		The city of
Bancroft	LOCATION	's birth ,
Worcester	LOCATION	,
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, has always been proud of her incidental honor .

		Although
Bancroft	PERSON	left his home before he was ten years old , and returned only for brief visits , separated once by an inter - val of forty years , yet he always recalled his home with loving memory .

		He chose the city for his burial-place , and created for her youth a generous scholarship bearing the names of his father and mother .

		His father , the
Eeverend Aaron Bancroft	PERSON	, preached Arminianism fear - lessly , was rejected as pastor of the established
Congregational Church	ORGANIZATION	, but was chosen leader of a new '' second parish . ''

		From him the son inherited independence , intellectual acumen , and a keen interest in American history -LRB- the elder , it will be recalled , had produced a `` Life of
Washington	LOCATION	'' -RRB- .

		In a letter to
Oliver Wendell Holmes	PERSON	, when the writer was eighty-four years of age and still able to do fourteen hours of consecutive mental work a day ,
George Bancroft	PERSON	traced his endurance to a good constitution , fostered by his father 's urgence of daily exercise for body and mind in aU weather , and the reit - erated prayer of the household , '' Give us a teachable temper . ''

		He had less of the spright - liness which characterized his mother ,
Lucretia Chandler	PERSON	, than others of her thirteen children , but he profited by her cheerful example and the wholesome daily diet which she recalls in one of her playful letters , -- '' rye bread tosted , the fragments of cold coffee boyled and put on milk . ''

		Through the influence of friends the boy
Bancroft	PERSON	, who showed much mental assiduity at
Exeter	LOCATION	and
Harvard	LOCATION	, was given the use of university funds for four years ' study at
Gbttingen	LOCATION	and later at
Berlin	LOCATION	.

		The letters of this period of preparation , which was at first intended for the ministry , are interesting tran - scripts of the social life of students at German schools when that country was beginning to exert an influence upon the cidture of
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	.

		Anecdotes and traditions , some of which have been set down previously by others , revive memories of German university professors of the past -- Wolf ,
Schleiermacher	PERSON	,
Dissen	PERSON	,
Eichhorn	PERSON	,
Heeren	PERSON	, and others .

		Ban - croft 's vacation trips to
Switzerland	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	268 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, awakened a romantic ardor which was expressed in his letters and more fully in the little book of '' Poems , '' issued the year after his return to
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Howe	PERSON	is justified in passing by this Byronic effort with mere remark , for
Bancroft	PERSON	did not encourage remembrance of it among his friends .

		The verses , however , reveal the emotional and mental condition of the young man , freshly impressed by the beauties and romance of the old world and uncertain of his own future work .

		He once defined his pains - taking histories as an attempt to write '' an epic of liberty , '' and the poetic element in his nature was never eliminated by his researches .

		His history is literary and epical rather than scientific .

		Through this medium , instead of poetry , he won the fame for which he aspired so ardently in his student days , and of which he wrote , after his visit to the shrines of Italian poets : '' By honour stung , to me too give In bold invention 's heaven to soar , Nor all unknown to glory live , Nor perish to be named no more . ''

		As student , and later as diplomat ,
Bancroft	PERSON	responded naturally to German standards of scholarship and thought ; he also adopted certain European mannerisms which gave offense to his
New England	LOCATION	friends . ''

		There were harsh changes in store for
Bancroft	PERSON	when his wander - ings were done , '' says his biographer .

		He returned to
Harvard	LOCATION	as tutor in Greek , but he was unhappy ; he had broadened in religious and social ideas , while his friends had kept their tenets ' • little modified through contacts from without . ''

		Anxious to reform the educational methods in
America	LOCATION	by some active service , and deciding that he was better fitted to teach than to preach , he joined his friend
Joseph Green Cogswell	PERSON	in a plan for a school where he could work out his theories .

		Former pupils of this once-famous
Roimd Hill School	ORGANIZATION	at
Northampton	LOCATION	have written interesting reminiscences concern - ing it , -- notably Mr.
Thomas Appleton	PERSON	, in his '' Sheaf of Papers . ''

		Surrounded by beautiful scenery and supported by the patronage of aristocratic families in
New England	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	, the school still failed to fulfil its promise , and proved a disappointing chapter in
Bancroft	LOCATION	's life , as it is in his biography .

		After closing his relations with the school ,
Bancroft	PERSON	still lived in
Northampton	LOCATION	for a time , writing articles for the '' North American Review , '' translating treatises on history and political science by his friend , Professor
Pleeren	PERSON	, and recalling his impressions of Goethe from acquaintance and study by a review of this author 's work .

		His life abroad had stimulated his democratic principles , which he avowed so boldly that he became estranged from some
Massachusetts	LOCATION	friends .

		Mr.
Howe	PERSON	has said with proper emphasis that
Bancroft	PERSON	desired to be a national rather than a
New England	LOCATION	statesman .

		His Democratic fervor was evident in the first volume of his '' History of the
United States	LOCATION	, '' which appeared in
1834	DATE	and was met by a warning protest from his brother-in-law , '' honest ''
John Davis	PERSON	, Whig Governor of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, who advised him '' not to let the partisan creep into the work . ''

		The wife of
Bancroft	LOCATION	's youth ,
Sarah Dwight	PERSON	of
Springfield	LOCATION	, died in
1836	DATE	, and the following year he joined his family and name with that of Mrs.
Elizabeth Bliss	PERSON	, allied by birth and previous marriage with noted families of
New England	LOCATION	.

		For forty-eight years she was a true comrade to
Bancroft	LOCATION	, both in his diplomatic life and as adviser in his historical work .

		For seven years he served as Collector of the Port of
Boston	LOCATION	, with enough leisure for research and writing so that , by
1848	DATE	, three volumes of the History had appeared .

		Following the election of
Polk	LOCATION	as President , and because of
Bancroft	LOCATION	's part in securing this success , the latter was appointed Secretary of the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	, and filled this position and that of temporary Secretary of War with credit .

		Mr.
Howe	PERSON	gives evidences of
Bancroft	LOCATION	's share in the acquisition of
Cali	LOCATION	- fornia and the establishment of the
Naval Academy	ORGANIZATION	at
Annapolis	LOCATION	.

		Three years ago a volume of '' Letters from
England	LOCATION	'' by Mrs.
George Bancroft	PERSON	gave de - tailed accounts of the social life which she and her husband enjoyed in
England	LOCATION	during
the three years from 1846	DATE	to
1849	DATE	, when he was Minister there .

		In the present biography the letters reflect the political and scholarly activ - ities of these years .

		There are interesting let - ters to Polk and his cabinet members , showing the changed attitude of
England	LOCATION	toward the
United States	LOCATION	as the Mexican War progressed , and also giving
Bancroft	PERSON	's impressions of English aqd French statesmen and authors -- notably Lord
John Russell	PERSON	,
Lord Palmerston	LOCATION	,
Guizot	LOCATION	,
Lamartine	LOCATION	,
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	,
Hallam	PERSON	, and many others .

		Equipped with '' superb material '' which he had gathered for his History in
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	,
Bancroft	PERSON	returned to eighteen years of authorship as a private citizen in
New York	LOCATION	and at his estate in
Newport	LOCATION	.

		The three vol - umes which had already appeared were increased

		THE DIAL 269 to nine before the close of
1867	DATE	.

		During these years of writing , he kept in touch with the current political , social , and esthetic interests of
America	LOCATION	.

		Always opposed to slavery he was yet a Douglas Democrat , distrusting Lincoln at first but later becoming a strong admirer and his eulogist in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		In this memorial oration
Bancroft	PERSON	gave another proof of his tactless independence by comparing , with scath - ing epithets ,
Lord Palmerston	LOCATION	with
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	.

		Although he had arranged for the absence of the British minister , as Mr.
Howe	PERSON	has stated , yet his words increased the bitterness of feeling against him on the part of English newspapers and American opponents .

		There has been a lurking suspicion in many minds that
Hawthorne	PERSON	's appointment as Consul at
Liverpool	LOCATION	was the result of his admiring biog - raphy of his friend ,
Franklin Pierce	PERSON	, published just before the latter 's election as President .

		An unfortunate shadow of a similar kind has been cast on
Bancroft	LOCATION	's memory by the discovery of evidence , collated and published by Professor
Dunning	PERSON	of
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	, that
Bancroft	PERSON	wrote
Andrew Johnson	PERSON	's first annual message to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		The surmise is that
Bancroft	PERSON	was rewarded with the diplomatic place which had long been his goal -- that of Minister to
Berlin	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Howe	PERSON	gives frankly the proofs of
Bancroft	LOCATION	's service to
Johnson	PERSON	, so long a secret ; but he emphasizes
Bancroft	PERSON	's special fitness for the posi - tion , and his other political services , which should be remembered to his credit .

		The account of his life in
Germany	LOCATION	, during the crucial years of the Franco-Prussian war and the readjustments in
Germany	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	, is given with zest .

		In his letters vital impressions of great international events are commingled with records of conversa - tions with
Bismarck	PERSON	,
Bunsen	LOCATION	,
Von Moltke	PERSON	, and various literary celebrities whom
Bancroft	PERSON	met at the club of savants to which he belonged .

		Again , as in other political crises and in his History , the partisan spirit and its too frank expression brought him into controversies ;
Victor Hugo	PERSON	expressed in '' L'Annee Terrible '' the indignation of many Frenchmen against what they considered an official bias towards
Germany	LOCATION	and lack of neutrality on the part of President
Grant	PERSON	as well as of his representative in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Bancroft was seventy-four when he returned to
America	LOCATION	, chose
Washington	LOCATION	as his residence , and published the tenth volume of his History .

		The average man of good health and industry would feel that his life-work was nearing its end at this age , but
Bancroft	PERSON	did not accept such a belief .

		He realized that his History must be circumscribed by the period from
America	LOCATION	's discovery to her real beginning as a nation ; but he determined to make that segment more com - plete by writing a '' History of the Formation of the Constitutions , '' which he published , in two volumes , in
1882	DATE	.

		He also revised two editions of his History , -- the centenary edition of
1876	DATE	and the later one of
1883	DATE	.

		An interesting page in Mr.
Howe	PERSON	's biography is given to a compar - ison , in parallel columns , of the earlier ornate and discursive description of the colony of
Virginia	LOCATION	, in the original form in
1834	DATE	, and the brief and direct style in the last revised edition .

		These '' final years '' of the historian 's life are pictured with graphic effect -- his inces - sant activities in library , garden , or on horse - back , and the tireless zeal which called from
Holmes	PERSON	the comment , '' You must be made of iron and vulcanized india-rubber , or some such compound of resistance and elasticity . ''

		Mr.
Howe	PERSON	offers no detailed examination of the History .

		Some salient traits of
Bancroft	LOCATION	at the time of his greatest productivity are pointed out .

		The most marked characteristic was his industry ; a second was the '' fervid belief in himself '' which involved him in private and literary controversies such as that of the '' Grandfather 's War , '' following his estimates of certain Revolutionary generals .

		His avid grasp after first-hand material led sometimes to his placing a disproportionate value upon manuscripts over later and revised publications .

		The method by which he kept , in diaries , the calendar of each year that he was studying his - torically , noting not alone the major events but also lunar changes , etc. , of each day , indicated his earnest desire for accuracy and realism .

		These diaries , with his other papers and books , are now in the
Lenox Library of New York	LOCATION	, not - withstanding
Bancroft	PERSON	's earnest desire to have them owned by the nation .

		An excellent biblio - graphy , compiled by Mr.
Henry C. Strippel	PERSON	of the
Lenox Library	ORGANIZATION	, forms an appendix to Mr.
Howe	PERSON	's biography .

		There are no comparisons suggested here between
Bancroft	PERSON	and his contemporaries in historical writing , --
Motley	ORGANIZATION	,
Prescott	PERSON	, and
Hil	PERSON	- dreth , -- or his successors of our own generation .

		Of the earlier group he is entitled to rank as a pioneer by reason of the extent and research of his studies .

		It is doubtful if
Bancroft 's History	ORGANIZATION	is read voluntarily by many youths to-day , or if it is really enjoyed when re-read by many of middle life .

		The author failed to achieve the picturesque and vivifying effects which are 270 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, found in
Motley	LOCATION	,
Prescott	PERSON	, and
Parkman	LOCATION	.

		In his '' Conclusions '' Mr.
Howe	PERSON	lays due emphasis upon the inter-relation of
Bancroft	LOCATION	with his age and his literary work ; he cites many failings judged by current criticism , but in extenuation of
Bancroft	LOCATION	's aim and methods he says : '' Into these the personal equation and what may be called the temporal equation vitally entered .

		Especially n the free use of his materials must he be judged according to the standards of his day .

		It was a day in which quotation marks were not the sacred enclosures they have become ... Admit the worst , that at times , with his immediate ends in view , he made such uses of his manuscript materials as to impair their value to future students \ yet remember always that he col - lected these materials with a thoroughness and an appreciation of their worth which the most modern of historians can hardly surpass , and that his pioneer work in this direction has been of untold benefit , actual and suggestive , to many who have come after him .

		This he does for no meta - physical reasons ; no '' Power divine which moves to good '' has ever been observed in his laboratory ; he has not '' the remotest idea if nature has any ideal and if the appearance of man on the earth were a part of such an ideal , '' -LRB- p. 333 ; a curious sentence , no doubt better in the original French -RRB- .

		He has lived , however , to see the physical evils of human existence conspicuously lessened through scientific dis - coveries , in the development of which he has had a most honorable part .

		To him , it is Science , not Religion , which is to be the regen - erator : for '' Science has already justified the hopes which have been placed in it .

		It has saved peoj -RRB- le from the most terrible diseases , and has made life much easier .

		On the other hand , religions which demand an uncritical faith as the means of curing the ills which afflict humanity have not fulfilled their promises . ''

		Of the various evils which may be lessened or banished by the intelligent application of scien - tific methods , disease and premature death are the most important .

		Professor
Metchnikoff	PERSON	, realising in his own person some of the disadvan - tages of old age , has been led to raise the ques - tion : Why shoidd the last period of life be so handicapped by manifold disadvantages , and * The Pkolongation OF Life : Optimistic Studies .

		nearly always cut short by some pathological process ?

		There are savages who have so little regard for their old people that they do not hesi - tate to eject them forcibly from the world ; but among civilized peoples , where there is so much to be learned , where experience is so costly and so precious , the cutting off of the elders can scarcely be regarded with satisfaction .

		The mere prolongation of life is not
Metehnikoff	ORGANIZATION	's ideal ; he has no deSire to see the number of helpless aged increased ; but he maintains that it should be possible to prolong the period of active and useful existence far beyond its pre - sent customary limit , and that if this were done people would at length die normally and hap - pily , as they sleep .

		The tragedy of death , for them and for their friends , would cease to exist , and thus the sorrow of mankind would be lightened to an immeasurable degree .

		Whatever we may think of Professor
Meteh	PERSON	- nikoff 's philosophy , the ideal thus set forth is a noble one , and perhaps not wholly imattainable .

		Should it be realized , '' old age will be post - poned so much that men of from sixty to seventy years of age will retain their vigour , and will not require to ask assistance in the fashion now neces - sary .

		On the other hand , young men of twenty - one years of age will no longer be thought mature or ready to fulfil functions so difficult as taking a share in public affairs '' -LRB- p. 329 -RRB- .

		The present dominance of the comparatively young may appear to be justified as promoting progress ; but it is at least doubtful whether the period of life during which the struggle for personal advantage is fiercest , and the outlook narrowed in consequence , is one in which it is possible to take a broad view of public affairs .

		There are few in this country who would exclude the young man from politics , but both in politics and education we might well afford to exchange some measure of our restless youthful energy for the calm wisdom of maturity .

		We could afford this , but perhaps the exchange is not necessary .

		In countries happy in the possession of wise and esteemed old men , it is delightful to see the youth , fired by their ideals and example , adding thereto the vigor and enterprise they possess so abundantly ; not too slavishly fol - lowing the masters , but in every good sense upholding and continuing the golden threads of past achievement .

		Thus the later years of
Ruskin	LOCATION	,
Darwin	PERSON	,
Gladstone	PERSON	, and others were of priceless value to the generation following .

		On the other hand , those who have had to do with education know too well that the mere contact of youth with youth fails to produce either

		THE DIAL 271 breadth of view or desirable ideals ; and there are some at least who for this very reason regret the prevalent immaturity of the present gener - ation of teachers .

		Those of us who have read with enthusiasm of the zeal displayed by German students of the forties in upholding their ideal - istic political views , find it humiliating to dis - cover that American students of to-day are similarly energetic in defending nothing better than their '' right '' to engage in horse - play or become intoxicated .

		But to return to Metchnikoff , and his plans for promoting robust longevity .

		He is per - suaded , after considering the subject from every point of view , that intestinal bacteria are to blame for most of the trouble .

		The discussion is scientific and technical , and can not be con - densed here ; but he concludes that a most important remedy is found in the bacteria of soured milk , or lactic acid bacteria , which in - hibit putrefaction in the large intestine .

		He himself has employed this treatment for many years , and is well satisfied with the result . ''

		A reader who has little knowledge of such matters may be surprised by my recommendation to absorb large quantities of microbes , as the gen - eral belief is that all microbes are harmful .

		This belief , however , is erroneous .

		There are many useful microbes , amongst which the lactic bacUli have an honourable place '' -LRB- p. 181 -RRB- .

		Nevertheless , the subject is said to be still very imperfectly understood ; it wUl be necessary to test the theory by numerous observations , car - ried on for considerable periods of time . ''

		In the meantime , those who wish to preserve their intelligence as long as possible and to make their cycle of life as complete and as normal as is possible under present conditions , must depend on general sobriety and on habits conforming to the rules of rational hygiene '' -LRB- p. 183 -RRB- .

		Although Professor
Metchnikoff	PERSON	's book is important on account of its topic , and interest - ing and suggestive in its treatment of it , it is impossible to praise it very highly from a literary standpoint .

		The translation is probably accu - rate , but too literal to be elegant .

		The whole structure of the book , however , can only be described as loose-jointed , and this can not be peculiar to the English version .

		The latter haK contains a number of rather disconnected essays , including a lengthy dissertation on Goethe and ''
Faust	PERSON	, '' in which some serious problems are raised and , on the whole , left rampant .

		`` With praiseworthy honesty , the author is careful to exhibit the different sides of the questions he discusses and to cite the adverse criticisms of his contemporaries .

		Qften , however , we are left in a rather puzzled condition , not knowing how to estimate the value of the statements made .

		Thus , at the end of the discussion of remedies , we find the words regarding general sobriety and so forth , quoted above ; and we natu - rally think that in this rather vague statement we have an irreducible minimum .

		But on page 91 our attention is called to the following : '' Sobriety is certainly favourable to long life , but it is not necessary , because quite a number of centenarians have drunk freely .

		Several of those who are catalogued by
Chemin	ORGANIZATION	, * drank wine and spirits even to excess .


Catherine Reymond	PERSON	, for instance , who died in
1758	DATE	at the age of 107 years , drank much wine ; and
Politiman	PERSON	, a surgeon who lived from
1685	DATE	to
1825	DATE	, was in the habit , from his twenty-fifth year onward , of getting drunk every night .

		... A most curious example is that of the Irish land owner
Brawn	PERSON	, who lived to the age of 120 , and who had an inscription put upon his tombstone that he was always drunk , and when in that condition was so terrible that even death had been afraid of him . ''

		Even the scientific statements can not all be accepted without question .

		It is no doubt the fault of the translator that in one or two places moths are called butterflies ; but the assertion on page 100 that Amaryllis lutea '' passes through .

		all the stages of its life-history in ten days '' evidently rests on a misconception .

		The plant is a bulb , and the ten days must refer simply to the reproductive period , which is a very different matter .

		To discuss all the debat - able points would , however , be equally impos - sible and inappropriate in this place .

		The illus - trations are decidedly unsatisfactory , largely as the result of poor presswork and probably of old blocks .

		Ik Marvel '' was sixty years ago hailed as the natural successor of ''
Geoffrey Crayon	PERSON	,
Gent	PERSON	. ''

		And '' Ik Marvel '' has lived to write charming prefaces to his numerous works , in
1907	DATE	.

		Washington Irving inherited directly from
Goldsmith	PERSON	.

		He carried into the
America	LOCATION	of the nineteenth century the style of the English essayists of the eighteenth century .

		He was accused of lacking that highly prized and yet rarely defined quality , '' Americanism . ''

		Did he not delight to tell the story of rambles in the old world ?

		Was there not a genial warmth in his account of an English country house ?

		Did he not throw the glamor of old-world romance over new - world scenes ?

		Was not his humor quiet rather than obstreperous ?

		Did he not prefer meditation to business ?

		After answering all these queries in the affirmative , one may add that in these respects
Irving	PERSON	was very like a considerable number of his countrymen .

		They , too , had an affectionate interest in the land of their forefathers , and a preference for the amenities of life .

		It is to this class that
Donald G. Mitchell	PERSON	belongs .

		Throughout his literary life there has been a noticeable detachment from contemporary inter - ests .

		In the early fifties , when the country was aflame with anti-slavery agitation , he wrote '' The Reveries of a Bachelor '' and '' Dream Life . ''

		During the Civil War no echoes of the strife are allowed to disturb the agricultural meditations of ''
Edgewood	LOCATION	Farm . ''

		This Amer - ican country-gentleman has lived the life of an English country-gentleman of literary procliv - ities .

		He looks out upon the world from his snug retreat as
Horace Walpole	PERSON	looked out upon it from his imitation castle on
Strawberry Hill	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Mitchell	PERSON	, though he has written much and well , is still known as the author of '' The Reveries of a Bachelor . ''

		One takes up the book with a little trepidation .

		Will it bear re - reading ?

		What a very young bachelor he was !

		He was only haK through his twenties , and yet his air was so solemnly reminiscent .

		In the strenuous days of President
Roosevelt	PERSON	there seems something artificial in the pose .

		Why should a young fellow of twenty-six assimie to have reached '' the years that bring the philo - sophic mind , '' and sit by the fire , whether it be of crackling hickory or glowing anthracite ?

		Why should he not be up and doing ?

		Then we remember that literary taste '' be - fore the war '' was not intolerant of sentiment or even of sentimentality .

		Young gentlemen indulged their feelings in the publicity of prose , and did not feel compelled to hide behind the veil of esoteric verse .

		In fact , it was a period when the distinction between prose and verse had broken down .

		A generation that en - joyed versified novels like ''
Aurora Leigh	LOCATION	'' and '' Lucile '' had a warm welcome for prose-poems .

		The fact that the '' Reveries '' and `` Dream - Life '' have had a steady sale for half a century is a reassuring sign that the reading public does not really grow old .

		There are always certain readers who are in their twenties , and some of them have the courage of their convictions .

		The underlying conviction is that they have lived long , and seen through many illusions , and pondered deeply the problems of life , and have left only one problem unsolved , -- does the Per - fect Woman belong to the category of the existent or the non-existent ?

		As the fire flames or fades they grow sentimental or cynical , and find them - selves equally interesting in either condition .

		All this was pleasantly set forth by Mr.
Mitchell	PERSON	before he turned his mind to the more mundane matters of sub-soiling and the rotation of crops .

		It is well that in the later editions he refrained his hand from his earlier work .

		He could only have marred the completeness of the impression .

		Here at least it is true that '' second thoughts are prose . ''

		If in his first books Mr.
MitcheU	PERSON	takes us back to the past , it must be said that the work of his maturer days was in some respects that of a pioneer .

		Within half a dozen years there has been a great revival in out-of-door litera - ture .

		Scores of books have been written and periodicals published setting forth the charms of country life .

		It is part of a most hopeful move - ment back to the land .

		It was not so in
1863	DATE	, when '' My Farm of
Edgewood	LOCATION	'' was published .

		The question had not then become urgent , -- '' Do you find your brain taking breadth or color out of carrot raising or pumpkins ? ''

		Mr.
Mitchell	PERSON	had to educate his readers to an appre - ciation of the possibilities of the farm .

		As a literary farmer he has been a great success , and his career has been a refutation of his own thesis that the practice of agriculture is not conducive to intellectual development .

		He has managed to get two crops from his land , using the rainy days to gather in the '' harvest of a quiet eye . ''

		Perhaps he has been too good a farmer to get the best , or rather the most lucrative , literary results .

		The '' best sellers '' have been books confessing to such amazing misadventures in the art of husbandry that even we of laity , pent up in cities , could see the joke and join with
Reuben	PERSON	and
Jake	PERSON	in their laughter .

		Mr.
Mitchell	PERSON	never

		THE DIAL 273 made blunders of sufficient magnitude to be broadly amusing .

		When he takes us into his confidence he never gets beyond the quiet humor of a man who can point out the fact that
Connecticut	LOCATION	is not
Arcadia	LOCATION	.

		There is a pleasant contrast between the bookishness of '' Wet Days at Edge wood '' and the homely common-sense of the volume en - titled '' Out of Town Places , with hints for their improvement . ''

		But everywhere there is a serious enthusiasm for country life and all it brings with it .

		He is no fickle lover , and he warns his readers that they must be content with no superficial preference for rural things . ''

		I would not counsel any one to think of a home in the country whose heart does not leap when he sees the first grass-tips lifting in the city court - yards , and the boughs of the Forsythia adrip with golden censers .

		Many a man mistakes a certain pleasurable association of his boyhood days with the , country for an earnest love ; it may be only a sentiment which will wilt with the scorching heats of
August	DATE	, and will die utterly when the frosts nip the verdure of the year . ''

		No man of letters , if he lives long enough , escapes writing a novel .

		Mr.
Mitchell	PERSON	's novel , '' Dr.
Johns	PERSON	, '' has shared the fate of
Henry Ward Beecher	PERSON	's ''
Norwood	PERSON	, '' which was of the same period .

		It is remembered as the work of a man who had done better things .

		Throughout these volumes we have many glimpses of the warm friendship existing be - tween the author and his publisher , Mr.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	.

		Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons have in this beautiful edition furnished a memorial of this friendship .

		Not all these volumes are likely to be read , but it is good to have them bound together .

		Of the best of them we may say , as Mr.
Mitchell	PERSON	says of '' The Sketch Book '' : '' I know there is a disposition to speak of it rather patronizingly and apologetically -- as if it were reminis - cent -- Anglican -- conventional -- as if he would have done better if he had possessed our modern critical bias -- or if he had been born in
Boston	LOCATION	-- or born a philosopher outright : Well , perhaps so -- perhaps so . ''

		But I love to think and believe that our dear old Mr.
Irving	PERSON	was born just where he should have been born , and wrote in a way that it is hardly worth our while to try and mend for him . ''

		I understand that a great many promising young people -- without fear of the critics before their eyes -- keep on persistently reading that old Sketch Book , with its ' Broken Hearts , ' and ' Wife ' twining like a vine , and ' Spectre Bridegroom , ' and all the rest . ''

		And I suspect that those same promising young people are also still reading the '' Reveries of a Bachelor '' and '' Dream Life . ''

Two Coxtinents	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Colonel
Clark E. Carr	PERSON	, already known through his contribution to the history of
Illinois	LOCATION	-- '' The Illini : A Story of the Prairies '' -- and his shorter work on '' Lincoln and
Gettysburg	LOCATION	, '' has led a life sufficiently varied and eventful to warrant expectation that any reminiscences published by him in this his eighth decade must prove of rather unusual interest .

		Born in
Erie County	LOCATION	,
N. Y.	PERSON	, in
1836	DATE	, but early transplanted to
Illinois	LOCATION	soil , choosing the law for his profession and Republicanism for his political creed , he became a zealous anti- slavery worker and has taken an active part in nearly every important pre-election campaign since that of
1856	DATE	^ when he mounted the stump for
Fremont	LOCATION	.

		In the Civil War he served as colonel on the staft * of Governor
Yates	PERSON	, the '' war governor . ''

		Chosen a delegate to the national Republican convention of
1864	DATE	, he was again appointed a delegate , this time at large , in
1884	DATE	.

		Under President
Harrison	PERSON	he served as United States Minister to
Denmark	LOCATION	, and at the
Paris	LOCATION	Exposition of
1900	DATE	he did our Western farmers a good turn by his successful management of the
American Com Kitchen	ORGANIZATION	, which accomplished so much in creating a demand for our national cereal in countries until then ignorant of its virtues .

		With such a fund of experience to draw upon , and with a retentive memory and a facile pen .

		Colonel
Carr	PERSON	has produced , in '' My Day and Generation , '' a thoroughly readable book , brisk , breezy , and cheerful , and , one can not but believe , admirably characteristic of the writer , whose friendly countenance and ample propor - tions make an attractive frontispiece to the volume .

		Twenty-eight chapters -- all short ex - except the first , which describes in detail '' A Journey to
California	LOCATION	in
1869	DATE	with Governor
Yates	PERSON	'' -- present a rapid succession of partial portraits and of glimpses of things seen in
America	LOCATION	and
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Happening to meet with
Carl Schurz	PERSON	in that early
California	LOCATION	journey , the author has recorded his recollections of the man , and especially com - pliments him on his command of our language ; but , in seeking to account for the unusual ele - gance and purity of his speech .

May 1	DATE	, underwent no such period of incarceration , but acquired his English by oral exercise in
London	LOCATION	and , later , in this country .

		Another little matter in which one is tempted to put the author right : he extdts in the freedom from custom-house annoyances that makes travel through our broad land so delightful as compared with a journey across
Europe	LOCATION	, and he thus complacently ex - presses himself : '' Notwithstanding all the extravagant declamation of the doctrinaires about what they are pleased to call ' the robber tariff , ' ours is the greatest free-trade country of the earth . ''

		This assertion , just at this time , will to some seem a little amusing .

		Among the famous men of an earlier day whom Mr.
Carr	PERSON	met and talked with were Lincoln ,
General Sherman	ORGANIZATION	,
Owen Lovejoy	PERSON	,
Martin Van Buren	ORGANIZATION	,
Eobert G. Ingersoll	PERSON	,
Rutherford B. Hayes	PERSON	,
Benjamin F. Wade	PERSON	, and
Oliver P. Morton	PERSON	; but concerning none of these public characters does he record anything so noteworthy and characteristic as to call for quotation here .

		An account of a call on
Hayes	PERSON	, at
Columbus	LOCATION	, in those days of suspense in
February , 1876	DATE	, shows us the soon-to-be Presi - dent in a state of eager , almost boyish , expecta - tion that may surprise the reader and lead him to doubt whether , if the odd vote had gone the other way , the defeated candidate would have borne his disappointment with all the dignified calm displayed by his rival .

		Some of the best pages in the book treat of matters European , and more particularly
Dan	PERSON	- ish .

		From the many passages concerning the late King Christian IX. , '' the grandfather of
Europe	LOCATION	, '' a few sentences describing the new American Minister 's reception at his hands may be of interest here . ''

		It is said that , as a Minister represents his sovereign , or as in my case his chief magistrate , no one has suffi - cient rank to present him to the sovereign to whom he is accredited .

		Certainly on this occasion I was quite alone with the King in the audience-chamber .

		I had never before been in the presence of royalty , and it was only natural that I should feel some degree of embarrassment .

		This , I think , His Majesty observed ; not , as I came to believe , to my discredit ... '' In the most perfect English the King replied , wel - coming me to
Denmark	LOCATION	, and expressing the hope that my residence at
Copenhagen	LOCATION	would be agreeable , both to myself and to my family , which terminated the formal audience .

		I had been made aware that it is the privilege of royalty to end all interviews , and sup - posed of course that the time had come when the
King	ORGANIZATION	would signify that my business was finished .

		Not so .

		His Majesty continued : '' ' I am very happy , Mr. Minister , to welcome you just now to my home .

		You are to dine with my wife and me -LSB- he did not say '' the Queen '' -RSB- , and we have with us our children and grandchildren assembled under this roof .

		You are this evening to be one of our family circle .

		I will present you to them , and hope that you will make friends with us all , as we will do with you .

		We shall soon expect to receive your wife and children , and hope that before very long you will feel that you are at home in our dear
Denmark	LOCATION	. ' ''

		One chapter is devoted to the Codex Flatey - ensis or Flatey Book , which , some readers may like to be reminded , is an ancient Icelandic manuscript containing , among other historical or semi-historical narrative , an account of what was probably the first visit of white men to these shores .

		Written more than five hundred years ago , the Flatey Book is
Denmark	LOCATION	's most precious literary possession .

		Consequently when , in the autumn of
1892	DATE	, Minister
Carr	PERSON	was instructed from
Washington	LOCATION	to ask for the loan of the priceless parchment , for public exhibition at the
Columbian Exposition	ORGANIZATION	, the Danish authorities were strongly disinclined to grant the request .

		But as public interest in the matter grew , and as our country had offered to take the most extraordinary precautions to protect the volume from loss or injury , even to the sending of a war vessel for its convoy ,
Denmark	LOCATION	at last con - sented -- too late , however , as may be remem - bered , for all our available ships of war had by that time been ordered to
New York	LOCATION	to take part in the great naval parade .

		A facsimile reproduction from the venerable codex and a short account of its history and contents close the chapter .

		In enumerating Mr.
Carr	PERSON	's public offices , we have omitted his appointment to the postmaster - ship of
Galesburg	LOCATION	in
1861	DATE	.

		To that appoint - ment we probably owe his excellent chapter on '' The
Eadway Mail Service	ORGANIZATION	, '' since it was his official duty that brought him into communica - tion with
George B. Armstrong	PERSON	, originator of that service , and a man of something like genius in his chosen work .

		The story of the organizing and perfecting of this department of the post - office is told from first-hand information , and an account is given of a trip on the first fast mail train -LRB- whoUy of mail cars -RRB- that ran -- from
New York	LOCATION	to
Chicago	LOCATION	,
September 16-17	DATE	,
1875	DATE	.

		It is reassuring to learn how rare are the mistakes made in the handling of the twenty million pieces of mail matter that now pass from sender to receiver in the course of a year : the errors amount to about one in twelve thousand pieces handled .

		Colonel
Carr	PERSON	's pen is not so severely correct as to be incapable of making an occasional slip .

		Of Judge

		THE DIAL 275 the dates of his birth and death are correctly given .

		In expressing himself , Mr.
Carr	PERSON	occa - sionally indulges in a tangled or otherwise awkward construction -- but not often .

		Amid periods so irreproachable as most of his are , it is somewhat disconcerting to encounter an infini - tive that is not simply split with an adverbial wedge , but actually rent asunder as with dyna - mite .

		Let us illustrate : '' When I told him we were -LSB- going to the Yosemite -RSB- , he expressed a desire to , with his wife , who was on board , join us and be of our party . ''

		Recent Educational , Discussions .

		* Worthy of far more space than can be given it here is Dr.
W. E. Chancellor	PERSON	's recently published '' Theory of Motives , Ideals , and Values in Education . ''

		Super - ficiality is a common fault of educational writing of the day , which runs too much to '' the elaboration of the obvious . ''

		So far removed is this book from any such weakness that one often feels that the author is still struggling to express the conception which is as yet new even to him ; often , too , one finds himself , at least on first reading , in sharp opposition to the views propounded .

		More careful reading wiU clear up many apparent obscurities , and doubtless mature consideration will bring one closer to the author 's radical positions .

		The book is not for all readers , but rather for those who can bring to it some knowledge of philosophical as well as edu - cational thought .

		To such it will prove a stimulus and inspiration .

		Every teacher may well feel a deep satisfaction in the production of so strong and able a work on the deeper problems of his profession .

		We wish to call attention briefly to three or four characteristic features of the work .

		The first is the proposition that education should be independent of all external control ; this the author maintains in one of his most powerful chapters , entitled '' The Subordination of the School . ''

		To the average American , the state-controlled public school is a sacred thing , even though he worships it somewhat as a fetish ; to Dr. Chancellor , the
State School	ORGANIZATION	is '' a disease '' with '' disagreeable complications . '' ''

		Better , '' he says , '' the dependence of the School upon the Church than upon the
State	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		system , he assures us , is a mere transition ; the School is not to return to the control of the Family or of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, but it is to go free from the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		What is to come is `` the independence of a sufficient group of educators from all external control -LRB- save , of course , public opinion -RRB- . ''

		The American school - system stands alone in its non-professional and local control .


Germany	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	have professional authority for all educational affairs , and central control for all large general matters .

		-LRB-
England	LOCATION	has , of course , as yet no school system , but only a '' Schulwesen . '' -RRB-

		But in
America	LOCATION	we not only put our common schools into the hands of unexpert , sometimes even uneducated , persons , -- we do not hesitate to entrust even higher education , the uni - versity itself , to the absolute and final discretion of men to whom in some cases the very nature and problems of higher education are quite unknown .

		The facts of the usurpation in question are summed up by Dr. Chancellor thus : '' Wherever the public school of the
State	ORGANIZATION	exists , there it is absolutely con - trolled and in every respect directed by a political board of education .

		The superintendent , if any there be , is chosen by that board .

		Courses of study , text books , rules and regulations , generally appoint - ments , transfers , discharges , and always salaries of teachers , are determined by the board '' -LRB- p. 132 -RRB- .

		The most original portion of the book is Chapter VIII. , which deals mainly with '' The Progressive Stages of Education , '' or , rather , the stages of the development of the individual soul , which of course must determine the course of rational education .

		Dr. Chancellor names seven of these stages ; we summarize them with some hesitation and with apolo - gies for possible misinterpretation .

		First , the dawn of consciousness ; second , the awareness of the body ; third , acquaintance with the outer world ; foirt ` th , knowledge of one 's own soul , and hence of the duality of soul and body ; fifth , the attainment of self-direction ; sixth , the power to control others ; seventh and highest , '' the comprehension of the world-spirit . ''

		Few reach the higher stages ;
Napoleon	PERSON	and
Washington	LOCATION	lived in the sixth , the first as a failure and the second as a success in it ; even Plato and
Socrates	PERSON	and Lincoln failed to attain the seventh ; Jesus alone has attained it .

		In this chapter the reader feels most of all that the author has not fully succeeded in clothing his ideas in ade - quate form ; but it is perhaps none the less worth reading for that .

		From the multitude of other striking propositions in this work , we pick two almost at random .

		Dr. Chancellor derides the prevalent prejudice against married women as teachers , -- and it must be ad - mitted that he makes out a good case for the opinion that every staff of teachers should include a consider - able proportion of mothers .

		`` A high-school of a thousand students needs a faculty of forty or fifty teachers , ten or a dozen fathers , as many mothers , and a minority only of subordinate bachelors and maidens , corresponding to the youthful tutors of the colleges and ushers of the English schools '' -LRB- p. 173 -RRB- .

		276 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, In general , we know of no more illuminating discus - sion of the problem of the teaching force in
America	LOCATION	than this chapter , on '' The Formal System of Education . ''

		Finally , Dr. Chancellor perceives and declares that our present period of compulsory education is inade - quate .

		In the ideal school , '' every boy and every girl will be kept at school until adolescence has passed its climax and character and intelligence have been well established '' -LRB- p. 175 -RRB- .

		We should have been glad to see much more space given to this subject in a book dealing with the theory of education as a whole .

		The vast majority of our children are dismissed from school just when the real work of character forma - tion begins .

		We are acting upon the old fallacy embodied in the oft-quoted saying , `` Give me the child until he is twelve , and I care not who has him afterwards . ''

		Let us , rather , learn wisdom from those unequalled educators , the Jesuits , who left the boy to others until he was twelve -LRB- or thereabouts -RRB- , and then took him in hand , holding him if possible until he reached the age of manhood .

		The means of education for the youth who now leave school at fourteen must be discovered and put vigorously into operation .

		Nothing is more noticeable , in recent educational discussion , than the great access of interest in the problem of moral training .

		The world is re - awakening to the old truth that the rational end of education is character , and that the great problem is how to lay hands upon the development not only of bodily and mental powers , but also upon the directive will .

		A striking incident in this general condition is the case of the
California	LOCATION	Prize Essays on '' Moral Training in the Public Schools . ''

		About two • years ago , announcement was made that a citizen of
California	LOCATION	, who wished his name withheld -LRB- and who has not yet seen fit to permit his identity to be revealed -RRB- , offered two prizes of
$ 500	MONEY	and
$ 300	MONEY	, respectively , for the best essays on the subject mentioned .

		Some three hundred essays were re - ceived by the committee in charge ; award of the prizes was made , and in further execution of the wishes of the donor the best essays were published .

		Besides the two prize essays , three others were chosen for this honor .

		The book containing them is now at hand , bearing the title originally announced for the essays , '' Moral Training in the Public Schools . ''

		The five writers are as follows , in order of the judges ' award : Mr.
Charles E. Hugh	PERSON	, Principal of the
Bay School	ORGANIZATION	,
Oakland	LOCATION	,
California	LOCATION	; Rev.
T. P. Stevenson	PERSON	,
Philadelphia	LOCATION	; Prof.
E. D. Starbuck	PERSON	of
the University of Iowa	ORGANIZATION	; Mr.
Frank Cramer	PERSON	of
Palo Alto	LOCATION	; and Principal
George E. Myers	PERSON	of the
McKinley Manual Training School	ORGANIZATION	,
Washington	LOCATION	, D. C .

		The book is short , and readable throughout .

		It is surprising to find so little duplication of opinion and proposals .

		Some general ideas , of course , ap - pear in all the papers ; but detail and definite proposals are completely varied .

		Perhaps this is indicative of the rudimentary state of the problem of moral education ; doubtless when we have made more progress toward scientific knowledge of the laws of moral development we shall find much more common ground for the pronouncements of experts .

		As space does not permit special review of each of these essays , we content ourselves with one or two remarks concerning them .

		Most striking is the unan - imous conviction of the urgency of the problem , and of our present remissness ; and here , fortunately , most thoughtful people will agree .

		The most interesting positive proposal is made by Dr.
Stevenson	PERSON	: '' Let the
State	ORGANIZATION	teach in her public schools the system of morality which is embodied in her own laws , with such sanctions as the religious character of the
State	ORGANIZATION	herself supplies '' -LRB- p. 79 -RRB- .

		We note with regret that no adequate recognition is given to the fact empha - sized by Dr. Chancellor , as before noted , that the positive formation of character takes place mainly in the secondary and not in the elementary period .

		We find in the essays no effective plan for meeting the ethical needs of the great mass of children who drop out of school before they are fifteen , and no adequate treatment of the peculiar problem of the secondary school .

		The essays abound in practical suggestions calculated to aid the teacher in making better use of the means now at hand in the school , and no teacher can afford to neglect a careful reading of the book .

		The thanks of all interested in education are due to the generous and modest giver of the funds for the prizes and the publication of the essays .

		Two educational books by English writers are in our present group .

		The first , '' The Child 's Mind , its Growth and Training , '' by
W. E. Urwick	PERSON	,
M.A.	LOCATION	, we may dispose of in a few words .

		It seems to contain nothing that has not been better said by previous writers , such as
Kirkpatrick	PERSON	,
Rowe	PERSON	,
Tracy	PERSON	, and especially Tyler .

		We find in the book ele - mentary matter set forth in a complicated and difficult style ; in consequence , the reader who is in need of such a book will find this one obscure and perplexing , while those who can readily understand the book do not need to read it .

		In passing , we can not but marvel at the statement that '' Common sense will teach every teacher the importance of fresh air '' -LRB- p. 34 -RRB- .

		Would that this were so , not only as regards teachers , but also housekeepers , church wardens , and the whole race of janitors !

		The production of monographs marks an ad - vanced stage of the science to which they relate .

		Books on education en gros have been long in vogue , and it is good to see a change in such books as Mr.
M. W. Keating	PERSON	's '' Suggestion in Education . ''

		The work is , as its title indicates , a study in educational psychology ; and it is a very thorough and helpful one .

		The writer has uncommon powers of psycho - logical description : his account of the subconscious , for example , seems to us the best short description we have met -LRB- p. 143 ^ -RRB- .

		He has also in a high degree the art of making his exposition vivid and interesting without being diffuse , by mingling just the right proportions of the concrete and the didactic .

		THE DIAE 277 The plan of discussion is clear and logical .

		In the hypnotic state , and in '' splitoff selves , '' we are shown the extreme forms of suggestion and dissoci - ation ; then we * pass to an examination of suggestion in normal waking states .

		Next come the conditions , preliminary and immediate , under which suggestion is effective -- with constant reference to the teacher 's task .

		The remaining four chapters , from the seventh to the twelfth , really deal with the influence of sug - gestion in the formation of character ; and we know of few more fruitful studies of moral education .

		Of peculiar interest are the conclusions drawn from the fact that indirect suggestion is always more power - ful than direct , owing to the contrariant ideas likely to be roused by direct suggestion .

		Speaking of a noted school-book , the author says : '' Yet for many boys the very title , ' Book of Moral Lessons , ' would be sufficient to bring up the resolve that under no circumstances would any of the moral apothegms therein contained be permitted to touch the springs of action '' -LRB- p. 167 -RRB- .

		The writer points out that many popular methods of moral instruction suffer from the weakness inherent in the direct form of suggestion .

		He comes to the defence of the classics and of Jiard studies in English literature : '' The harder the technique of the subject , and the more it is studied for itself , the more will the conditions for indirect moral suggestion be present '' -LRB- p. 177 -RRB- .

		The whole chapter from which we quote , '' Some Practical Applications , '' is of uncommon value to the teacher -- especially to the teacher of literature , in whatever tongue .

		Both
Caesar	ORGANIZATION	's Commentaries and
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's Odes would be vastly more vital and powerful in the school-room if turned by the method recommended thi-ough indirect suggestion to ethical stimulus and illumination .

		If there is any truth -LRB- and there most ^ par ' ^ tlT certainly is -RRB- in the poet 's assertion that '' self - reverence , self-knowledge , self-control , -- these three alone lead life to sovereign power , '' it nowhere more clearly demonstrates itself than in the domain of parental government .

		Mr.
Ernest Hamlin Abbott	PERSON	's pleasant and profitable little book `` On the Training of Parents '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- illustrates this truth with much shrewdness , humor , good sense , and evidence of actual and often perplex - ing experience .

		The obligation resting on parents to honor their children , no less than on children to honor their parents , is convincingly demonstrated .

		`` I sometimes wonder , '' says the author , `` if it is really just to lay the
Fifth Commandment	ORGANIZATION	upon all American children .

		Somehow , there seems to be something reciprocal implied in it .

		If that com - mandment is of universal application , it can be con - sidered so , I imagine , only on the ground that it states a duty owed ultimately not to the parents but to the
Almighty	LOCATION	.

		Certainly that parent who does not respect his children has no personal claim upon their honor . ''

		Two sentences a little further on strike the keynote of the book : '' Preliminary to teaching children how to obey is the process of learning how to command .

		When a child is intransigent , it is worth while to consider whether it is not he that is administering the rebuke . ''

		A fine capacity for as - suming the child 's point of view , and also a sense of humor , are revealed in the following : '' The one unescapable part of our children 's environment is -- ourselves .

		Over them we are always impending .

		At inconvenient times we rise in their way and impede their most absorbing occupations .

		On their excur sions into the wilds of fancy it is we who obtrude and with philistine complacency drive them back into the gross world of wash-basins and table manners .

		Three small boys are busy blasting .

		One is a work - man ; a second is the fuse ; the third is the hole , and is about to explode for the sixth time .

		Who inter - rupts with some trivial but insistent remark about less noise or clean clothes ?

		One of us .

		And the worst of it is that we who are so troublesomely recur - rent , and who are their source of supplies , seem to be incapable of appreciating the delights of becoming at will a trolley-car , an alligator , a goblin , or a hole in the ground . ''

		There is significance in the fact that the author is a grandson of that oldtime favorite of children ,
Jacob Abbott	PERSON	, whose numerous and excel - lent books include one on '' Gentle Measures in the Management and Training of the Young . ''

		director of the
Nobel Institute	ORGANIZATION	in
Stockholm	LOCATION	, has been led into astronomical fields by his researches in the borderlani between physics and chemistry .

		About five years ago he published a treatise on cosmical physics , which was recognized by astronomers as worthy of high praise .

		So cor - dially was that work received by scientists in general that Dr.
Arrhenius	PERSON	has developed and explained his theories in a popular way in a new work , '' Worlds in the Making , '' which has been done into very fair English by Dr.
H. Boms	PERSON	, and is published by
Messrs. Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	.

		The book opens with a discussion of the present state of the interior of the earth , as judged from the phenomena of volcanoes and earthquakes ; from which the author concludes that the crust can not be very thick , and that the interior core is gaseous .

		The gas , however , being under great pressure , is very viscous , and contains much iron and other metals .

		On the exterior of the earth , life is thought to have existed for millions of years , and to have a good chance of continuing -- thanks to the presence of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere -- for untold ages to come .

		The heat of the sun , the maintenance of which is commonly ascribed to a slow process of contraction , is more probably due , our author thinks , to powerful chemi - cal reactions , which may maintain the present output of light and heat for many thousands of millions of years to come .

		The pressure which 278 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, sunlight is now known to exert upon bodies is great enough to drive very small particles away from the sun itself , just as this force repels the tenuous matter in the tails of comets .

		Many of these par - ticles enter our atmosphere , and cause electric and magnetic disturbances , among which the aurora borealis is to be reckoned .

		The sun , as it contin - ually loses heat , will finally become comparatively cool , like the earth ; and while in this state it may come into collision with some similar body , thus giving rise to a spiral nebulae , from which a new solar system may be formed , to repeat the history of its predecessor .

		The evolution of worlds may thus `` continue in an eternal cycle , in which there is neither beginning nor end , and in which life may exist and continue forever and undiminished . ''

		The concluding chapter develops the theory that germs of lowly organic life are being continually carried away from the earth and other planets into the sea of ether , eventually to fertilize other worlds .

		It is to be regretted that neither the author , the trans - lator , nor the publisher of this thoughtful and stimulating book has provided it with an index ; for though the work contains only 230 pages , it is full of details many of which will be valuable for pur - poses of reference .

		The Comtesse In a third volume of the English and ParUin translation of the '' Memoirs of the the twenties .

		Comtesse de Boigne '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- the chatty Frenchwoman continues her recollections and impressions of persons and events through the decade 1820-30 , covering the latter part of Louis XVIII .

Charles X.	PERSON	, with some first-hand accounts of the stirring street scenes that madeJhe month of
July , 1830	DATE	, a mem - orable one for I ^ is and for
France	LOCATION	.

		As in the preceding instalments of this rather gossipy chron - icle , men and women of note in French history or literature are touched upon at frequent intervals , but not , one regrets to find , with very much of keen insight or remarkable descriptive power .

		The reader feels little better acquainted with Chateau - briand or
Talleyrand	LOCATION	or Guizot , after reading these memoirs than before .

		In the passing references to these and other celebrities there is one mention of
Cardinal Talleyrand	LOCATION	that might , so far as the con - text and the appended footnote and the index , too , are concerned , tend to deceive or bewUder the un - wary reader : he might pause to query whether the famous diplomat , the Prince of
Benevento	LOCATION	,
Abbd of St. Denis	ORGANIZATION	, Agent-General of the Clergy , Bishop of Autun , and holder of numerous other ecclesiastical benefices and titles , had also received the red hat as the crowning recognition of what
Mirabeau	PERSON	called his infdme conduite .

		It was , however , the great
Talleyrand	LOCATION	's uncle ,
Alexandre Ang	PERSON	^ lique , who at - tained to the cardinalate , though the index identi - fies him with the nephew .

		The publishers ' note in designating this instalment of the '' Memoirs '' as '' the third and final volume , '' might lead the reader to infer that the Comtesse had tired of her task long before her hand was palsied by age -- she lived to be eighty-five , or thirty-six years after the last events recorded in her third volume .

		As a matter of fact , the reminiscences were continued , we know not to what date , but a fourth volume has been edited for publication in the original , and will soon appear , if it is not already issued .

		A long chapter , describing the
Duchess of Berry	ORGANIZATION	's unsuccessful attempt to create a revolution in favor of her son , the Count of Chambord , was printed last month in the '' Revue des Deux Mondes . ''

		Those who have become inter - ested in the translated memoirs will hope for still another volume in English .

		experiences as a patient in several asylums for the insane is well maintained from cover to cover of his book -- `` A Mind That Found Itself '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- .

		As a human document , it should contribute effectively to a better under - standing of what insanity is and of the treatment it requires .

		It is an autobiographical narrative dealing with a phase of human experience that cries imperatively for - care and insight .

		The distrust that surrounds one whose mental health has been lost is difficult to overcome .

		We can not easily look upon it as illness , but rather as dethronement of all that is vitally human , a disorganization hardly to be recovered from .

		No reader of Mr.
Beers	PERSON	's nar - rative can fail to be impressed with the underlying community of thought and feeling that remains during the disturbed period , and requires for its ministration the same type of sympathetic attention that facilitates all varieties of convalescence .

		The psychological interest concerns itself with the inside view of insanity here recorded with close fidelity , and with an imusual ability of the recovered mind to rehearse in sane recollection the disturbed experi - ences .

		These were typically violent , and yet devel - oped about a few fundamental delusions , themselves subject to the oscillations of morbid depressed suspicion and grandiloquent elation .

		The other interest is humanitarian , and takes the form of a fervent protest against the brutal violence of attend - ants and the abusive mis-handling of unsympathetic and uncomprehending physicians .

		It is hardly conceivable that in this day and generation such practices as this narrative recounts should be so widespread .

		In the presence of such possibilities , the fear of impending insanity would be more than equalled by the dread of such abusive treatment .

		The plea is for the principle of non-restraint , -- a principle that has proved its value wherever honestly and appreciatively introduced .

		The book naturally carries with it , in spite of the critical care of friendly revisers , much of the intensity of an irritable tem - perament ; yet with ample allowance for this trait , the account rings true , and should do much to enlighten the public in regard to what is needed in the way of practical reforms for the work of minis - tering wisely to minds diseased .

		THE DIAL 279
William Penn	PERSON	^ '' ^ '
Colquhoun Grant	PERSON	, who claims portravedbv direct descent from
William Penn	LOCATION	, a descendant .

		gg ^ yg j ^ ^ j ^ g preface to her book , ''
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	and Courtier : The Life and Work of
William Penn	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- that `` the twentieth century still waits for a biography which will not only deal with
Penn	LOCATION	the
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	and politician , but
Penn	LOCATION	the man '' ; and such a biography she essays to furnish .

		But it is only a few years ago that Mr.
Sydney G. Fisher	PERSON	gave us his excellent work on `` The True
William Penn	PERSON	, '' a more detailed and intimate pic - ture than Mrs.
Grant	PERSON	has succeeded in producing , and one that bears evidence of greater study and care in its preparation .

		As an indication of Mrs.
Grant	PERSON	's too little effort to exclude from her book all that is insufficiently authentic , we quote from her preface : `` My thanks are due ... to
Dugald Stuart	LOCATION	,
Esq.	LOCATION	, for allowing me to reproduce his interesting original portrait of
William Penn	LOCATION	'' -- as if this were a hitherto unpublished and an undoubtedly authentic likeness of the man .

		On the contrary , prints of this idealized picture of young
Penn	LOCATION	in shining armor and with flowing locks -- painted no one knows when or by whom -- are common enough , taken both from the
Stuart	PERSON	original and from the copy of the latter in the possession of the
Pennsylvania Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		Moreover , its striking unlikeness to other portraits of
Penn	LOCATION	, and especially to the
Bevan	PERSON	carving in ivory which , by good contemporary testimony , is a lifelike repre - sentation of the man , makes it the least suitable figure to place as a frontispiece to a volume pur - porting to give the real WUliam
Penn	LOCATION	and no other .

		Mrs.
Grant	PERSON	tells her story pleasantly , and throws about the events of her great ancestor 's life a good deal of the historic framework that such a narrative requires ; but apart from the use she has made of a few hitherto unpublished letters , she can not be said to have produced an original work or one that fills any aching void in literature .

		Her literary style would be improved by more careful attention to punctuation : she overworks the comma , inserting it between two complete sentences where a full stop is called for , and even using it between the subject and the predicate of a very short and simple sen - tence .

		The genealogical tables are useful , and the large clear print of the book is beyond praise .

		Personaiitv , and ^ ^ ^ popular interest in affairs of other mysteries the mind is Still strongly tinged with ofpsvchoioav .

		the flavor of expectant mystery .

		In some measure , this wondering anticipation is sug - gestive , and possibly is a survival , of the attitude toward the mediaeval wielder of the black art .

		To those thus disposed , science is a fairy who bestows marvellous gifts -- electric lights and wire - less telegraphy , anti-toxins and seedless oranges , to say nothing of automobiles and air-ships .

		Mental science is to bring like marvels and yet more won - derful results , such as telepathic communications , thought-waves , the reading of the future , the unseen moving of tables , and trance states overflowing with revelation , to say nothing of communication with the departed and the cure of all iUs -LRB- including sin and poverty -RRB- by absent treatment .

		Reasoning is at best an uncertain art , and with analogy as a guide the popular vision is often led by a myopic leader .

		Yet it is well to recognize that the interest in mental functions and abnormalities is sound and deserves cultivation .

		It is on the whole fortunate that one who writes for the people on `` The Riddle of Per - sonality '' should present so valid a perspective of what is going on as does Mr.
H. Addington Bruce	PERSON	in his book with this title -LRB-
Moffat , Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- • It is true that material of the most various purport is confusingly set side by side , and that the reader is likely to carry away a wholly misleading notion of what psychologists are really interested in .

		The emphasis on the `` riddle '' of things is wholly out of proportion to the accounts of what we know of per - sonality and its vicissitudes .

		The man of science profoundly regrets that the public asks and absorbs this kind of a book , instead of a popularization of what psychologists are really studying ; but such being the case , he takes what comfort he can in the fact that the presentation is temperate and not extravagant , and he finds further comfort in the guidance offered by the author to prospective students , who , if they follow it , may find the path toward an understanding of personality , not as a mystery but as a profound natural development .

		Although it is not free from errors that one does not look for in the writings of a distinguished
Berlin	LOCATION	professor , it delights the reader from time to time by its felicitous summaries of complex situations .

		The attitude of sympathetic observer , which Dr.
Lenz	PERSON	assumes , often results also in well-balanced interpre - tations of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's motives and plans , impossible to those who are always hunting for evidences of Satanic intrigue .

		But if Dr.
Lenz	PERSON	is not shocked by the spectacle of brutal exercise of power -LRB- and no Bismarckian can well be -RRB- , he is not indifferent to British aggressiveness .

		He appears to accept the Napoleonic explanation as to why the approach of peace generally was found to be a mirage .

		It was not merely the outbreak of war in
1803	DATE	that
England	LOCATION	was responsible for , but the seizure of
Spain	LOCATION	was rendered inevitable by the turn of British policy indicated in
King George	ORGANIZATION	's speech from the throne in
January , 1808	DATE	.

		The best part of Dr.
Lenz	PERSON	's biography is the chapter on
Corsica	LOCATION	, which delineates the growth of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's character up to the siege of
Toulon	LOCATION	.

		From the evident attempt to penetrate the secret of his development , one expects that this dominant thought will be kept in the foreground during the treatment of the later career also ; but here we find events , rather than the hero 's moral or mental attitude , of chief interest to the author .

		280 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, Dr.
Lenz	PERSON	carefully analyzes the remains of
Napo	ORGANIZATION	- leon 's early literary efPorts , especially the essay for the prize offered by the
Lyons Academy	ORGANIZATION	, in which he discovers a theory of the state that is already '' essentially that of the ruler . ''

		Napoleon was then a young man of ideals intensely cherished .

		The danger , writes Dr.
Lenz	PERSON	, was that his ideal world should reveal itself as a world of illusion , and that '' his thinly disguised melancholy , grown intensified , should lead him to despise his ideals . ''

		This danger , the author intimates , had become a reality , partly as a result of the factional struggles in
Corsica	LOCATION	, before the period of his astonishing success began .

		In memory Scholarship is the chief pride of a of President scholar ; his fittest memorial is a
Harper	PERSON	.

		piece of scholarly work .

		President
Harper	PERSON	of
the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	was a scholar in the field of Semitic studies .

		His colleagues and confrhres in this large expanse have prepared and published , under the editorial supervision of Profes - sors
Robert Francis Harper	PERSON	of
Chicago	LOCATION	,
George F. Moore	PERSON	of
Harvard	LOCATION	, and
Francis Brown	PERSON	of
Union Theological Seminary	ORGANIZATION	, two sumptuous volumes of learned essays .

		Twenty-six of the leading Semitic scholars in the
United States	LOCATION	have each contributed a scientific treatise on some theme in which he is a specialist .

		These discussions cover a wide range of topics .

		Several of them are careful textual studies of some of the books of the Old Testament , and present the criticus apparaticus for a detailed exegesis of those books .

		Some of the papers are translations of early Sumerian inscriptions belong - ing to long ages before the Christian era , and reveal to us the fact that scholars are to-day masters of a language which a few years ago was practically inscrutable .

		There is no field of scholastic investi - gation in which greater strides have been made in the
last quarter-century	DATE	than in that represented by these researches .

		They touch all the South - western Asiatic continent , from the most ancient known dates , approximately 5000 B. C , down to the present day .

		The Assyrian and Arabic empires , with all that they meant for those times , are the objects of our investigators .

		No more fitting and enduring monument could be erected to the late President of the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	than these two noble volumes of scholarly treatises .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		The
University of California	ORGANIZATION	inaugurates its economics series of publications with a huge work , by Mr.
Wesley C. Mitchell	PERSON	, on '' Gold , Prices , and Wages under the Greenback Standard . ''

		It makes a volume of over six hundred pages , crammed with statistical tables and charts .

		Such a pace as is here set for the academic monograph will be hard to follow .

		In preparing her volume of '' More Modem Mono - logues , '' Miss
Marjorie Benton Cooke	PERSON	has worked , if possible , more successfully than in her earher collection , the vein of humorous character-study which she has made almost her own .

		We are particularly taken with the group of three heroines --
Ada	ORGANIZATION	,
Shaw	PERSON	, and Ibsen -- who come at the end of the volume .

		They are trifles , but amazingly clever , although perhaps no more so than many of the other studies .

		The

		Professor
Clarence S. Hamilton	PERSON	's '' Outlines of Musi - cal History , '' published by the

Canada	LOCATION	and the fruitless efforts of Choiseul to bring about an early peace .

		Several important maps are included in this section of the work .

		A new edition of Dr.
E. W. Scripture	PERSON	's '' Thinking , Feeling , and Doing '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- has recently appeared .

		This popularization of some of the data of modern psychology appeals to a legitimate clientele ; but it would make its appeal as effectively and more legiti - mately were it divested of its more sensational and tactless illustrations , both pictorial and linguistic .

		The occasion of a new edition might well have effected this improvement .

		The '' Cambridge Poets '' now number an even score of volumes , having been brought to that number by the '' Spenser '' which
Professor R. E. Neil Dodge	ORGANIZATION	has edited for
Messrs. Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Miffiin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The editor has worked long and arduously in the preparation of his text , which is the result -LRB- except for a few poems -RRB- of a double collation of the standard -LRB- mostly first -RRB- edi - tions .

		It is not easy to get the whole of Spenser within the limits of a single volume , and it takes nearly eight hundred of the two-columned ''
Cambridge	LOCATION	'' pages to do it .

		All the special features , both editorial and typo - graphical , which fit this series so admirably for the use of readers and students alike are once more exemplified in this noble tome . ''

		Corpus Schwenckfeldianorum , I. '' -- this is the im - posing title of a heavy quarto of more than seven hiuidred pages .

		Both volume and title become even more imposing when we learn that the complete '' Corpus '' wUl fill no less than seventeen such tomes .

		The origin of the work is the Schwenckfelder Church of
Norristown	LOCATION	,
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, but it comes to us by way of
Leipzig	LOCATION	, bearing the imprint of Messrs.
Breitkbpf	PERSON	und
Hartel	PERSON	.

		The editing of the work , on the other hand , hails from the
Hartford	LOCATION	Theological Semmary , being in the hands of Messrs.
Chester David Hartranft	PERSON	,
Otto Bemhard Schlutter	PERSON	, and
Elmer Ellsworth Schultz Johnson	PERSON	.

		We are informed that upwards of forty thousand dollars have been expended in collecting the material for this colossal publication ; how much more will be expended upon its manufacture we do not ven - ture to estimate .

		The volume now in print is devoted to `` A Study of the Earliest Letters of

		NEH ^ mission for the preface of a hook has been discovered by the brilliant author of '' iAn ^ American Student in
France	LOCATION	. ''

		He finds it a convenient repository for a secret ; for we all know that no one ever reads a preface I On that supposition tAbhe
Klein	PERSON	ingen - uously confides to the Preface of his new book his own secret : that it was not written by a student of
Chicago	LOCATION	; that its author is too old to go to school , -- except to teach there ; and that the name of the city where he lives is
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Perhaps the reader will not only pardon the disguise so can - didly admitted , but also envy the fortunate students under such a teacher .

FELIX KLEIN	PERSON	, of the
Catholic University of Paris	ORGANIZATION	The author has indeed discovered , or , if not discovered , at least invested with fresh charm , the Old World as epitomized in the bright life of the city to which all good Americans go eventually .

		His hero is a young American , who , with memories of college lectures on French history and art fresh in his mind , is peculiarly fit to appreciate what he sees .

		And the people with whom he comes into contact show him all the various phases of Old World life .

		From
Bernard de Pujol	PERSON	, urbane and witty , he learns the Royalist 's view of the present government ; the grave young Abbe sheds much light on the momentous
Church and State	ORGANIZATION	intricacy , and his thorough modernity comes somewhat as a surprise to the hero .

		Yet all his new friends offer their information , not patronizingly , but with that lightness of tone , that indescribable play of French irony which has its thrust good-naturedly now at French , now at American prejudice . ''

		The scenes which he visits in various parts of
France	LOCATION	are described with care , and historic and literary associations are touched upon .

		The author is well qualified to make such a book both instructive and entertaining . '

		NOTES 316 LIST OP NEW BOOKS 317 A DRA MATIC FEAST .

		Just
seven months ago	DATE	we made some com - ment upon the enterprise of Mr.
Donald Robertson	PERSON	in organizing a company of players , and planning a series of dramatic performances representative of the best classical and contem - porary dramatic authorship .

		We expressed confidence in his ability , and believed that he would prove successful in doing for the cul - tivated
Chicago	LOCATION	public what the amateurish management of the ill-starred New Theatre of the year before had attempted to do , and failed .

		The event has justified our prediction , and Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	's
Company	ORGANIZATION	has now closed its eight months ' season with an artistic record in which all concerned may take just pride .

		His work has been by far the most interesting done by anybody during the past year in the local the - atrical world , and it has a more than local significance , for it has transformed into a partly - accomplished fact what was before only the dream of a few idealists , namely , the creation of a theatre for the production of the best examples of the literary drama .

		This is an expression which we are not afraid to use , despite the flippancy of newspaperdom and the scorn of commercialized theatricalism ; we use it simply as a convenient phrase for describing all the works in dramatic form which it is possible to fit to stage conditions , and which are at the same time good literature , worth printing in books and reading in the library .

		It is obvious that the phrase includes all of the world 's dramatic classics and a considerable portion of the contemporary product as well .

		If it includes practically none of the pieces which audiences eagerly flock to our theatres to see , so much the worse for our theatres .

		That the phrase is comprehensive enough to include also many works written for the reader alone is not to the point .

		Again we say , so much the worse for our theatres , but this time in the sense that their unfriendly attitude toward plays which are also works of literary art has been the direct cause of the divorce which has long existed be - tween literature and the stage .

		Most English writers of the past fifty years who have cared to work in the dramatic form have been absolved from the technical obligations which that form imposes by the knowledge that literary work , 294 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, however good it might be as such , was certain to find scant favor in the eyes of the managerial tribe .

		Why go to the trouble of adapting scenes and situations to the needs of the spec - tator , when no spectator was likely to be pro- vided ?

		The managers , sacrificing everything else to sensational effect and shallow entertain - ment , have had their logical reward .

		Rejecting the drama of ideas and insight and poetical diction , they have fed , and forced the public to feed also , upon the husks offered them by second-rate play rights .

		Unwilling to accept the terms essential to any enduring compact between the man of letters and the stage , they have degraded the theatre from its nobler func - tion , and reduced it to show and artifice and superficiality .

		This exile of literature from the theatre , where it has a prescriptive if not a divine right to reign supreme , has long been a crying scandal .

		Much hard pioneer work must be done before the exile is ended , and Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	, who is engaged in doing just this kind of work , should be made to feel that his labors are appreciated .

		What uphill work it has thus far been , he alone could adequately tell us .

		The outsider has seen some of his difficulties , but not all of them .

		The meagre support given to his enterprise by a heedless public has been patent to all obser - vation , as has also been the ignorance and worse which has characterized the accoimts of his work in the daily press .

		With one honorable excep - tion , the newspaper writers who are supposed to keep us informed about what is going on in the theatrical world , have dealt with this remarkable work in a spirit of indifference at the best , and at the worst of malice mingled with mendacity .

		They even went so far as to say -- to take one glaring example -- that a certain play produced by Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	-- one of the noblest of its kind , and one given many times with great suc - cess in the country of its origin -- had never before been performed , and was never even in - tended by its author for stage-production !

		Upon this precious premise was based an argument for the impracticality and general futility of the whole enterprise , and the general ear of the pub - lic was thus grossly abused .

		Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	, fortunately , offers a rare com - bination of the idealist with the man of practical resourcefulness .

		It is this union of qualities which has carried him through his first season in the face of the discouragements offered by slender support , recreant reviewing , malicious misrepresentation , the difficulty of finding suit - able quarters , and the defection of some of his most trusted associates .

		Opposed to these ob - stacles he has had to offer only his own enthu - siasm and tenacity of purpose , his own versatile abilities as an actor together with his power to train his company to artistic imity of effect , and his readiness to seize upon every available point of vantage .

		With anything less than this equipment , he would long ago have come to grief .

		Having it , he has completed one season without material failure and with a highly cred - itable record of artistic success , and now , with brightening prospects , he is planning next year 's work .

		That the sapling which has thus weathered its first storms may grow into a sturdy tree must be the wish of everyone who has the real interests of our stage at heart .

		During the season of a little more than eight months , Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	's company has given us seventeen plays , with two or three exceptions works of established character .

		They have been presented in nearly two hundred afternoon and evening performances , mostly in
Chicago	LOCATION	and its suburbs , although about twenty-five of the per - formances have been given in outlying towns of
Illinois	LOCATION	,
Indiana	LOCATION	, and
Wisconsin	LOCATION	.

		The list of the plays is of great interest .

		Four of them have been one-act pieces , given either in groups or as curtain-raisers .

		These four are Lamb 's '' The Intruding Widow , ''
Browning	PERSON	's '' In a Balcony , ''
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	's '' L'Intruse , '' and Mr.
Cale Young Rice	PERSON	's '' A Night in
Avignon	LOCATION	. ''

		The thirteen longer works are the following : Moli ^ re 's '' L'Avare , ''
M. Pailleron	PERSON	's '' La Souris '' -LRB- '' The Triumph of Youth '' -RRB- , Goldoni 's '' Un Curioso Accidente , ''
Giacosa	PERSON	's '' Come le Foglie , ''
Calderon	PERSON	's '' Nadie Fie Su Secreto '' -LRB- '' Keep Your Own Secret , '' in
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's translation -RRB- ,
Senor Echegaray	PERSON	's '' O Locura o Santidad , ''
Gogol	PERSON	's '' Revizor , ''
Herr Haupt	PERSON	- mann 's '' Friedensfest , ' Ibsen 's ''
Rosmers	PERSON	- hohn , ''
Herr Bjornson	PERSON	's ''
Sigurd Slembe	PERSON	, '' Part II. , and '' En Hanske '' -LRB- `` A Gauntlet '' -RRB- ,
Brown	PERSON	- ing 's '' A Blot in the ` Scutcheon , '' and a newplay entitled '' The Law , '' by Mrs.
Solomon Sturges	PERSON	, an American writer .

		Such a list as this fairly justifies the caption given to the present article .

		The many thou - sands of persons who have witnessed these performances have had a unique opportunity to become acquainted with such a series of masterpieces as has never before been brought to the playgoers ' attention , either in
England	LOCATION	or
America	LOCATION	, in any single season under a single management .

		Only three of the thirteen plays have ever before , as '' far as we know , been pro- duced anywhere in the English language .

		And
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 295 the list is admirably representative of the various aspects of the modem drama .

		From such great classical writers as
Calderon	LOCATION	, Moli ^ re , and Goldoni , to the men who are the chief sponsors for the modern movement , the gamut has run , making it possible to view three centuries of the drama in historical perspective .

		Noteworthy also is the balanced cosmopolitanism of the list , which includes plays from the six most import - ant continental literatures of culture , besides examples of - English and American authorship .

		Those who have been privileged to watch this experiment at close range have much cause to be grateful to the man whose determined and practical idealism has borne this fine fruit .

		It is a satisfaction to be able to state that eco - nomical management has made Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	's enterprise self-supporting for the season now ended , and that , with brightening prospects , his work will be resumed next
autumn	DATE	.

		It has gained a foothold , and its continuance is prac - tically assured .

		Therein is matter for congrat - ulation to all concerned , and it is with unfeigned pleasure that we mingle our own congratulations with the rest .

		THE INTOXICATION OF WORDS .

		Some years ago I was sitting one evening on my porch , while a little distance away two colored coal - heavers were resting from their labors .

		They had the power to talk of Heaven and Hell ; and one of them discoursed in this wise : '' What 's a darkey want to go to Heaven for ?

		All he have to do there is sit up in the cold , cold night , enumerating the stars an ' counting the constellations of the Golden Host ; an ' then when the morning breaks he have to go down to the bottom of the garden an ' draw up millions an ' millions of buckets of water for the Children of
Israel	LOCATION	. ''

		I quote this speech because I think it affords a good example of the spell which mere words exercise over mankind .

		The most ignorant of men feel their power .

		Anyone who has listened to a darkey preacher of the old style can recall similar instances of unthinkable combinations of language which yet often had a touch of inspiration in them .

		Dry den confessed that a rhyme often helped him to a line ; and the negro speakers , laying violent hands upon fine words , sometimes found ideas tumbling in with them .

		More usually , however , they were like the
South Sea Islanders	LOCATION	who parted a chest of dress clothes among them , so that one wore a pair of breeches around his neck , another a coat belted around him like a skirt , and a third had a high hat perched upon his hairy horns .

		Words are not only for use -- they are for adorn - ment .

		They are not only the counters and coins with which we transact our business -- they are the jewels in which we array ourselves for dignity or pleasure .

		Properly used , they have the gleam and sparkle and color of gems , and they are as inde - structible .

		Genius showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold .

		Words are like deep-laden freighters plying between the shores of the abstract and the concrete worlds .

		They bring in their holds the spices , the webs of woven air , the fabrics of dream , from the one land , and take in return the corn and cattle and iron of the other .

		There are , properly , only two great systems of philosophy -- the system which makes all existence thought , as in
Plato	LOCATION	's Theory of Ideas , the Maya or Illusion of the
Hindoos	PERSON	, the Realism of the Schoolmen ; and the system which finds nothing in nature but matter and the sensa - tional experience of it .

		Words are the common carriers of both of these conceptions of life , as far , at least , as they are transferred from mind to mind .

		Whether the Idea and the Thing are one , and if so which it is that is the one , are questions not likely to be decided .

		But words are incarnations of the thought and symbols of the thing .

		In the hands of men entirely gi-eat , they are so much alive as to suggest the idea that the universe itself and all that is therein may be merely the written language of the Master Being of all .

		It is when words are new to us , when they sound to our ears like shells reverberant of varied oceans , when they glitter to our eyes with pearly opalescence , that their power is greatest .

		They are the spells which vitalize the magnificent make-believe of child - hood . ''

		That is a castle ! ''

		the boy cries ; and to the eyes of himself and his playfellows the old hair-cloth sofa swells out into barbican and battle - ments and keep .

		The cupboard is a robber 's cave , and jackets and pinafores become the panoply of knights or the garb of pirates .


India	LOCATION	is in one corner of the room and
Hudson Bay	LOCATION	in another .

		Prevailing poets , their undoubting minds believe the magic wonders that they speak .

		The child 's mind opens and expands to language more rapidly than to actual experience .

		It is , as a rule , dull to natural scenery ; it does not readily grasp human character ; it disdains the ordinary business of life .

		But out of words it weaves an enchanted world in which it moves in absolute disinterestedness .

		There is no shock of disillusion , because one experience in this world is just as good as another .

		There is as much excite - ment in losing a golden treasiu-e as in finding it .

		Being a hunted robber is as good fun as being a noble knight .

		Life is a delightful dream , and words are the substance out of which its hills and valleys and palaces and towns and people and pageants are created .

		Undoubtedly the artist 's mood is the child 's mood .

		Literature deals with much else besides art .

		It moralizes , it teaches , it satirizes , it exhorts .

		To the writer whose predominant tendency is for any of these functions , language is mainly a vehicle of thought , a medium of communication with mankind .

		296 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, It is not necessarily more sensuous or self-existent than mathematical formulae .

		But the pure artist merely dreams and creates ; and to him words are the most real of all real things , because he sees his visions rise out of them into existence , as clouds rise out of the sea .

		Not for him is it to doubt the truth of his word-embodied beings ; not for him to make any difference between the children of his brain -- to separate them into sheep and goats , to love and laud his good characters and hate his bad .

		He regards them all alike , so long as they can alike be clad in the vivid vesture of words .

		If he has any preference , it is for his dark or parti-colored projec - tions of sin and passion , because those are capable of more power and picturesqueness than his virtuous flock .

		On the other hand , the writer who is half artist and half moralist is continually in doubt as to the reality of his own creations .

		He is apt to speak of them contemptuously as puppets ; he rips his dolls open to show us the sawdust inside .

		He pursues his evil personages with implacable fury .

		His purpose is mainly moral ; and as he uses words only to convey his ideas , so he uses characters only to enforce them .

		All this may amount to very great work , but it is something quite different , and usually is inferior to the real artist 's dream-like disinterested reproduction of the world as fresh as on creation 's day .

		As words are most potent to children who are just learning them , so they are most pregnant with magic in the youth of a race when it is just forming its language .

		The discovery that things can be named , that we can pack the riches of the world into our minds , that we can in a way overrun and possess the earth by turning it into sign and sound , always intoxicates .

		And in the early stages of a nation 's growth , this discovery is very widely made .

		Then a poet addresses an audience of poets .

		Then brief and pregnant verse is preferred to dull and diluted prose .

		Then the images of life do not have to be spelled out and explained and illustrated and made visible by material objects , but hints and glimpses flash them at once into the minds of auditors themselves inflamed with creating fury .

		The one sensuous quality which inheres in words is sound .

		All their other powers to enlighten , to move , to intoxicate , depend on their arbitrary meanings , which we have to learn , on the way they are put to - gether by those who handle them , and on the associa - tions which they acquire .

		And though there is a large class of words , in every language , which give an echo to the sense , and sound like what they indicate , and though there is a still larger number of words of innately noble and mighty sound , yet in the main the delightfulness of words uttered in conjunction depends upon the skill of him who uses them .

		Alliteration , the repetition or contrast of vowel sounds , rhyme , assonance , the movement of words in quantity , accent , rhythm , measure , or the fixed employment of so many syllables or accents in a line , -- these are the sensuous resources of language , to which , in great part , it owes its intoxicating and memorable triumphs .

		They are really resources of verse ; for though prose can use some of them , it is seldom bettered by so doing .

		Alliteration is the most common means used to give distinction to moulded words , and its use ranges from the popular proverb up to the elaborate schemes of
Milton	LOCATION	or
Swinburne	LOCATION	.

		It is like the marking time , or keeping step , of a group of soldiers , which differentiates their movement from the vague shuffle of the crowd .

		It is apt to become an offence when too much insisted on ; and the greatest masters keep it half hidden , like a delicate chain thridding through and binding together their jeweled words .

		Milton usually has two or three sets of alliteration going at one time .

		Vowels have their alliteration as well as consonants , and it is upon their reduplication or sharp dissonances that much of the music of verse arises .

		Some poets , with all their care , can only bring forth light tinkling melodies ; while with others the vowels sound out rich and full like the notes of mighty bells or lordly organ-pipes .

		The principle of repetition of sound comes out most completely in rhyme and assonance , where , being undisguised , it is used to bind lines together and separate them from the con - text .

		Beyond the couplet and the quatrain , rhyme weakens sound by diluting it .

		I think such excess of rhyme weakens meaning , too , by a sort of subtle sympathy ; so that the regular sonnet and the Spen - serian stanza , while elegant and atrial , are less forcible and objective than simpler forms of verse .

		The principle of repetition is also involved in rhythm and measure , with their fixed use of quantity or accent ; but here it is the repetition , not of units , but of groups .

		A measured motion seems to be at the root of all such devices of language , and their material type is the dance .

		StUl larger repetitions of sound , as in the stanzas of a long poem , or the threefold division of a Pindaric ode three times repeated , may have some sensuous effect on readers at large ; but their appreciation is mainly for experts .

		I believe that , scientifically treated , the vibrations of sound can be made to transform themselves into color and figure .

		But there is only a remote possi - bility that words can so affect the nerves of men .

		All coloresque , sculpturesque , or architectural effects produced by language must be the result of the association of ideas .

		We early learn the meanings of words , and as we go through life each one of them gathers riches to itself until it draws after it a train - load of pictures and impressions .

		There is no reason in nature why one word should mean one thing more than another -- why the word '' splendor , '' for ex - ample , should not mean darkness , or vice versa .

		But once fixed in our minds that splendor means a certain quality of light and color , it absorbs into itself all our experiences of magnificent natural or human glories -- sunsets , serried mountain peaks , glowing autumn woods , great cities , man 's strength , woman 's grace , noble actions , and lofty dreams ; so that when the word is pronounced , all these concepts are shuttled before our eyes in one composite vision .

		When , therefore , the orator or poet or prose writer
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 297 begins his art-work which is to intoxicate or com - mand us , he has disposed upon his palette thousands of words which are vivid with our blood , trembling with our life .

		Caesar refuses his revolting legionaries the title of Milites -LRB- soldiers -RRB- , and calls them Quirites -LRB- citizens -RRB- , and so quells the mutiny with a word .

		The Irish multitude is cold to the idea of the
Trinity	ORGANIZATION	, until St.
Patrick	PERSON	plucks the familiar shamrock from the sod and exemplifies the trinal unity .

		The wielder of language has not only single words freighted with associate ideas at his command , but he has analogies , metaphors , comparisons , sim - iles , parables , tales , to draw upon .

		The whole experience of the race is his -- limited only by his hearer 's or reader 's intelligence .

		No other artist has a twentieth part of the weapons with which he is armed for the conquest of mankind .


Charles Leonard Moore	PERSON	, CASUAL COMMENT .

		A BRILLIANT PoLiSH GENIUS has passed prematurely from earth in the recent death of
Stanislas Wyspianski	PERSON	, who at the age of thirty-eight had distinguished himself as poet , painter , dramatist , and sculptor .

		It is said that at twenty-five he produced a masterpiece with his brush , another with his pen at twenty-six , and that in his last decade he gave more literature to the world than his compatriot Sienckiewicz in a lifetime .

		The son of a sculptor ,
Wyspianski	PERSON	naturally took up the chisel as his first chosen tool ; but , oppressed with the thought of his country 's unhappy fate , he seems to have needed more than one avenue by which to express himself and to attain a momentary forgetfulness of his melancholy .

		Noteworthy was his joining the movement of
Cracow	LOCATION	artists and writers to become the founders of a new race .

		Peasant women , healthy , ignorant , and unafflicted with nerves , were chosen to become the mothers of sturdy sons who should one day espouse their country 's cause and liberate her from the foreign yoke .

		The coarseness and shrewishness of
Wyspianski	PERSON	's mate seem to have grated on his nerves , but after she had borne him a number of children he married her , all the time toiling manfully for her and for their young family , -- painting wonderful pictures and writing plays innumer - able .

		His drama '' The Wedding '' caused him to be reckoned by his admirers as the greatest writer
Poland	LOCATION	had produced in a century .

		Losing the control of the fingers of his right hand some months before his death , he made the doctor bind a pencil to his liand , and so wrote on -LRB- though he could no longer paint -RRB- to the end .

		A heroic soul , surely , and worthy of the country that gave him birth .

		... , The rising standard of library schools is mat - ter for commendation .

		More and more is librarianship becoming recognized as a '' learned '' profession , and increasing honor will in future be paid to those who practise that profession .

		Entrance requirements and graduating tests in such library schools as that at
Madison	LOCATION	, or the one connected with the
University of Illinois	ORGANIZATION	, or the parent school at
Albany	LOCATION	, and others besides , are by no means ignobly easy to pass .

		In the current catalogue of the
Wisconsm Library School	ORGANIZATION	we read with satisfaction -LRB- under the heading , '' Extra Entrance Requirements '' -RRB- : '' It is desired that as many as possible shall come to the school with actual library experience .

		Practical work in a good library for a year or more , in addition to the educational requirements , is the best preparation for the year 's work in the school .

		Although desirable , such experience is often impossible , but accepted candidates who offer no library experience must spend at least one month in practical work in a designated library before the school opens in
Septem	LOCATION	- ber . ''

		And , what is even better , '' It is desirable that every student should be reasonably familiar with the most notable literature in all of the principal depart - ments of learning , through actual reading of the books themselves .

		But an intimate acquaintance with certain books is a special entrance requirement .

		A copy of this required reading list accompanies the application blank , and is sent only to those making formal application for entrance to the school . ''

		Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	at
Smith College	ORGANIZATION	, lec - turing on '' The Peasant in Literature , '' made a most favorable impression on her audience , and probably suggested to more than one hearer a comparison with her uncle
Matthew	PERSON	, who also lectured there in his American visit of twenty years ago , more or less .

		It was a felicitous reference , on the part of President Seelye in his introductory address , to the warm feehng cherished in this country for all members of
Thomas Arnold	PERSON	's family .

		Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's ease and grace of manner , and her command of an English not so baffling to American ears as her famous kinsman 's curiously enun - ciated speech , were a delight and in some degree a stu-prise to those who remembered
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's platform appearance .

		A scholarly study of the humble coimtryman in literature , from
Virgil	LOCATION	's time to Miss
Jane Barlow	PERSON	's , formed the substance of her address .

		That Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	has herself , in her stories , presented us with types of English peasantry that deserve to sur - vive in literature , will have occurred to all who take pleasure in her Derbyshire rural characters -- especially in her ''
Daffady	PERSON	, '' of `` Helbeck of Bannisdale , '' and her `
Lias Dawson	PERSON	, as presented in ''
David Grieve	PERSON	. ''

		These characters surely prove that Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	is not so far behind
George Eliot	PERSON	in a sense of humor as some have too hastily declared .

		A noteworthy circumstance in connection with Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's visit to
Massachusetts	LOCATION	is the arrangement she is said to have made with
Messrs. Houghton	PERSON	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	for the issue of a complete and imiform edition of her works , which will be illustrated , and will be heralded by a detailed prospectus in due course of time .

		This will be the first uniform edition of her writings .

		A publisher of the good old school has been taken from us in the death of
John Murray Brown	PERSON	, senior member of the well-known
Boston	LOCATION	firm of Little ,
Brown , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Not only those writers who have had personal experience of his genial approachableness and his ready response to all appeals in behalf of good liter - ature , but also the wider circle of readers and lovers of the best in the way of books , will regret his too-early departure from the scene of his useful labors .

		Named after
John Murray	PERSON	-- ■ the
John Murray	PERSON	of sixty years ago -- and inspired with similar ideals , Mr.
Brown	PERSON	was , line
Murray	PERSON	, the son of a prominent publisher and the father of a publisher ; in fact , two of his four sons ,
Murray	PERSON	and Philip , are associated with the paternal publishing house and in a position to hand on its tradi - tions to succeeding
Murray Browns	ORGANIZATION	.

		Not only did the 298 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, late Mr.
Brown	PERSON	succeed to his father in business , but he inherited from him the fine estate in
Belmont	LOCATION	that he made his home .

		Interesting himself in the welfare of his native town , he served for many years on the board of trustees of the
Belmont Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, and was be - loved and esteemed by all with whom this and other offices and duties brought him in contact .

		Among his classmates at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	were the late

Curtin	PERSON	's translations from the Polish , it will be remembered , and also his original works , were published by his classmate 's house .

		• • `` The ideal and the real in librarianship , as in every field of high endeavor , are so lamentably -LRB- or shall we say so ludicrously -RRB- discrepant that the spectacle of a graduating library-school class setting forth on its exalted mission in this world of illiteracy and material - ism may well move to thoughts that do lie too deep for tears , and that are therefore forced to avail themselves of a smile or a jest as the only avenue of outlet .

		A recent paragraph of ours -LRB- headed '' A Library Sign of the Season '' -RRB- touching , with an attempt at playful humor , on this aspect of the young librarian 's noble calling , has given unintended pain to at least one of our readers , who for some reason regards the paragraph as aimed at the
Library School of the University of Illinois	ORGANIZATION	, and takes occasion , in a friendly way , to deplore the acridity which , our correspondent thinks , seasons this and other items of our library comment .

		Perhaps it may be well to say here that the passage in question was suggested by a news item referring to a library school not in
Illinois	LOCATION	, and that our comment was of the most general and impersonal nature , applicable to hbrary schools in the moon -- if there are any there .

		But attempts at facetiousne.ss are always perilous , and we are glad to be rebuked , if the rebuke is deserved .

		It is at least gratifying to be charged with acridity rather than with insipidity .

		• • • More reading and less talking might be sug - gested as a cure for many of the ills to which this eagerly disputatious twentieth century is heir .

		The Rev. B. S ^ Lombard of
London	LOCATION	has attracted attention by declaring that many of the nervous diseases and much of the insanity that now afflict society are due to excessive indulgence in conversation .

		Wonderful , when one seri - ously considers the matter , is the amoimt of energy that can be dissipated in empty words ; and equally surprising is the gratifying discovery that unmeasm-ed volumes of energy may be stored up by the silent , thoughtful , atten - tive perusal of a powerful book .

		He who has not felt the renewal of force , the restoration of personal effec - tiveness , that often come with the reading of a play or only a page of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, or a book of Homer , or a chapter of Scott , has a pleasant sensation and a valuable experience still in store .

		To be sure , the spoken word and living presence of a gifted man or woman may equally , or in a greater degree , inspire one ; but how few of those with whom we daily consort speak with the tongues of angels , and how well convinced we are , or ought to be , that some half-dozen at least of the immor - tals have it always in their power to kindle us and make us glow -- unless there be something seriously at fault in ourselves .

		That ancient philosopher who put out his eyes in order to concentrate his gaze on the things within , would in this age have destroyed his hearing also , in order to hearken the more diligently to the still small voice in his own breast .

		There are those who , from com - pulsion and not from choice , have learned to value the quiet that comes with the dying away of outward noises , and to prize the precious time set free for the deeper things of literature and life when ordinary conversation has become inaudible to deafened ears .

		• • • A BEE-HIVE IN A LIBRARY is not an everyday sight , but this spectacle was seen , during the last Fall and
Winter	DATE	, in the children 's room of the
Medford	LOCATION	-LRB- Mass -RRB- .

		Public Library , whose resourceful librarian .

		Miss
Mary E. Sargent	PERSON	, firmly believes in showing the child of to - day , who is to be our citizen or perhaps our ruler of to-morrow , every possible attention of a helpful and educative sort .

		Hence this observation hive of bees , loaned by a Wobm-n bee-keeper , and watched by the little folk of
Medford	LOCATION	with intelhgent interest .

		Another novel mark of attention shown to the child , but perhaps not so keenly appreciated , is the insertion into books given out from the juvenile department , of slips of paper bearing the following suggestive lines -- the idea being borrowed from
Miss Hewins	PERSON	of the
Hartford	LOCATION	Public Library : '' THE LIBRARY GOOPS .

		/ '' With apologies to
Gelett Burgess	PERSON	. -RRB- ''

		The goops they wet their fingers To turn the leaves of books , And then they crease the corners down And think that no one looks . ''

		They print the marks of dirty hands , ' Of lollipops and gum .

		On picture book and fairy book As often as they come . ''

		These verses are also conspicuously posted for the ben - efit of all untidy children -- and one may hope to hear later of good results accruing .

		• • • An UNDESERVED ASPERSION , for which we are glad to make such amends as may be possible , was our recent inadvertent characterization of
New Orleans	LOCATION	as one of the only two large American cities '' that have thus far found life tolerable without a public library . ''

		The following statement , supplied on excellent authority , indicates a situation quite different : ''
The Fiske Free Public Library of New Orleans	ORGANIZATION	was founded in
1845	DATE	; though supported entirely by endowment , it afforded free library privileges .

		Its requirements , by reason of growth , were not covered by its income , and it was taken over by the city and additional support given in
1895	DATE	.

		The
Howard Memorial Library	ORGANIZATION	has been a free reference library for twenty years ; it has one of the best collections in the country , and is especially strong in American history .


New Orleans	LOCATION	was the recipient , in
1903	DATE	, of a gift of
$ 250,000	MONEY	from
Andrew Carnegie	PERSON	, for a new central library building with a number of branches .

		The new central building is nearing com - -LCB- -RRB- letion .

		Two of the branches have already been opened , and the others are already planned and under way .

		• c • A UTILITARIAN DEFENSE OF LITERARY CULTURE haS been made by an eminent Frenchman of letters ,
M. Paul Adam	PERSON	, in a contribution to the Revue H ^ ebdomadaire .

		Whereas Sir
Alfred Jones	PERSON	has recently declared that if he wished to spoil a young man for commerce he would send him to
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	or
Cambridge	LOCATION	,
M. Adam	PERSON	maintains
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 299 that it is just because the study of the classics has been abandoned by business men in
France	LOCATION	that the French are losing ground , relatively to other nations , in the commercial struggle for existence .

		The mental train - ing furnished by a classical education , he believes , is of value in the business world , and can be gained by no other course of study or system of drill .

		This valiant protest will fall on deaf ears , for the most part , but it is richly worth while to have made it .

		There is no honorable calling for which a good education in the `` humanities '' is too good .

		One can even measure calico better and sell it more successfully if , in the pages of great writers , one has caught a glimpse of the eternities and the immensities that no yardstick can begin to measure .

		To aim at doing well one small thing and no more , is to court failure even in that one thing ; while to be vastly greater than one 's work , and to do that work with the left hand , as it were , leaving unsuspected reserves of power for the emergencies that are sure to arise , is to command success .

		This utilitarian apologia for the higher truths and the deeper realities is hardly needed , but perhaps it is never entirely superfluous .

		, , .

		The removal of the reproach of senility will be accomplished if Dr.
Borland	ORGANIZATION	and Professor Metchntkoff have their way .

		The
Philadelphia	LOCATION	physician is bringing a powerful array of evidence to bear on the `` Century '' readers to convince them of the productivity and effec - tiveness of ripe old age , and the French bacteriologist is bending his energies toward the understanding and control of the fauna and flora of the intestinal regions and the prevention of the life-shortening ravages wrought by those microscopic forms of life in the basement sections of our alimentary canal .

		Let us think for a moment of the future gain to literature in this possible doubling of himian longevity .

		Though the coming litterateur of one hundred and fifty years might not break forth into songs of
spring	DATE	and lyrics of love , what a store of observation and ripened thought he would possess for the writing of historical and philosophical works !

		Systems of ethics and books of counsel to the young and collections of homilies would fall from his pen as naturally as mellow pears from the tree in
September	DATE	.

		Senility -LRB- or perhaps we shall prefer the term '' senectitude '' -RRB- will acquire an unimagined glory , and instead of saying with
Wordsworth	PERSON	that '' to be young was very heaven '' we shall feel that to grow old , in health and strength , is the crowning satisfaction of life .

		• • • Sensitiveness about one 's name , and a rigid in - sistence upon the proper observance by others of its established form and orthography , are common and on the whole creditable human characteristics .

		Occa - sionally , however , these are permitted to assume the proportions of a mania , not seldom betraying its victim into a situation either mirthful or distressing to the sane looker-on , A case in point , rich in irony , came recently to our notice .

		Not long ago a certain store received a postal card order bearing an unusually illegible signature .

		After long and prayerful cogitation , one particular guess at the occult scrawl was accepted as more probably correct than any other of numer - ous possibilities , and the order was despatched in due form .

		That the guess was a fairly good one , later developments proved , no less than eleven of the thirteen letters composing the signature being correct .

		But the true cognomaniac will recognize no degree or ex - tenuating circumstances in orthographic crime .

		Next day came a letter from him of the cryptic signature informing the astonished proprietor that all business relations between them had reached finality .

		Explana - tions or apologies , he took pains to specify , would be unavailing ; the decree was irrevocable .

		Sadly the pro- prietor perused this amazing letter , -- then an ironic chuckle escaped him .

		The first word of the missive was his own surname , and it was mis-spelled !

		• • • The man behind the manuscript is entertainingly discussed by '' a publisher 's first reader '' in the
April	DATE	issue of '' The Editor . ''

		The typewriter has done much to destroy individuality in authors ' manuscripts , but this '' first reader '' has the eye of a detective for those minute , inconspicuous marks of personality that still remain .

		Among the most curious are those described in the following extract from this interesting article : '' A sad moment comes to the
First Reader	ORGANIZATION	's heart when he chances on the Suspicious Man Behind the Manu - script .

		As he turns the pages of this Man 's story he comes on tell-tale bits of white paper or even on hairs placed at certain intervals throughout .

		This Man has laid a trap for the publisher .

		If his manuscript is n't read all the way through he is going to know it , and not only that , he means to know why also .

		Gently the
First Reader	ORGANIZATION	, to avoid trouble , shakes out the pages until he is fairly sure that all these
Sherlock Holmes	PERSON	devices have fallen out ; it is an innocent deception , has taken very little time , and may avoid feeling .

		But he sighs at the attitude of mind that demands of the cheese-taster that he shall eat the whole cheese in every instance to determine whether it is fresh or rancid . ''

		^ ... The public library book hospital is an important adjunct of the public library .

		Book-repairing and book - binding can be profitably done on the premises , especially if the librarian , or one or two of his assistanti , is deft - fingered and possessed of some mechanical ingenuity .

		After an experience of three years in conducting a bind - ery and repair shop in connection with the institution under his charge , the librarian of the
Easton	LOCATION	-LRB-
Pa.	LOCATION	-RRB- Pubhc Library is convmced that it is profitable for even small libraries to do their own rebinding and repairing .

		He believes that the work is well within the capacity of the average library assistant to master in a comparatively short time , and that his odd moments , if employed in this not unpleasant task , will keep the books in present - able condition .

		His report of the average cost of this rebinding and repairing is an astonishing one .

		In the
past year 1620	DATE	volumes were handled in his book hospital ,
1068	DATE	of them being rebound , and the total expense in - curred , including cost of materials , was only
$ 60.18	MONEY	.

		It must be a pretty poor book that is n't worth the expendi - ture of
four cents	MONEY	for a new binding .

		... A periodical with a creditable history , the familiar old orange-colored magazine known as '' Chambers 's Journal , '' has celebrated its three-quarter - centennial . ''


Auld Reekie	PERSON	'' has much to be proud of ; and among the products of its genius and industry not the least important are the works of literature and learning bearing the Chambers imprint .

		What a rich repertory of curious and instructive reading is contained in the faded yellow volumes of '' Chambers 's Miscellany , '' and even now there are those whose preference in ency - clopaedias is for the old , reliable Chambers .

May 16	DATE	, C ^ ^ It ^ to gooks .

		The Real ,
Hearn	LOCATION	.

		* It is most natural that noble achievement in literature should beget interest in the person - ality and life history of the author .

		The more we know about the man the better shall we interpret his utterances , and the more justly shall we estimate the value of his ideas .

		And yet is it not possible to know too much ?

		May we not thereby be tempted to look beyond the words , and fail nevertheless to take note of the extraordinary contradictions and inconsistencies that enter into the complexity of the human mind ?

		The work , when all is said and done , is the thing that is most worth dwelling upon .

		Can it add anything to the pleasure or profit with which we contemplate the lovely flowers of the lotus to be told that they
spring	DATE	from a bed of slime ?

		And when that fact is proclaimed may we not entertain a much exaggerated notion of its repulsiveness ?

		These questions are called forth by the pe - rusal of Dr.
George M. Gould	PERSON	's psychological study '' Concerning
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	. ''

		The book is a portrait rather than a biography . ''

		For those who boasted of being his friends , '' Dr.
Gould	PERSON	writes , `` it seems an astonishing thing that they should make
Hearn	PERSON	portray his vices , hie moral nakedness , so publicly . ''

		It might be supposed that one holding this view would gloss over these failings .

		Instead , per - haps no one else has more sharply delineated them .

		Having been heralded to the world , it is well that they should be shown in their true light .

		To correct misconceptions about them and to explain some of the traits that made
Hearn	PERSON	mil ike other men are among the purposes for which this book is written .

		For the best of
Hearn	ORGANIZATION	's literary work Dr.
Gould	PERSON	has high praise .

		The precious quality of his poetic prose meets with enthusiastic com - mendation .

		For the man himself he has com - passionate regard , but sees no reason why illu - sion as to his '' greatness '' should be entertained .

		He well says : '' Deprived by nature , by the necessities of his life , or by conscious intention , of religion , morality , scholar - ship , magnanimity , loyalty , character , benevolence , and other constituents of personal greatness , it is more than folly to endeavor to place him thus wrongly before the world . ''

		With this conclusion there can be no cavil ; • Concerning
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	.

		By
George M.Gould	PERSON	,
M.D.	LOCATION	With a Bibliography by
Laura Stedman	PERSON	.


Philadelphia	LOCATION	:
George W. Jacobs & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		though in passing it may be questioned whether personal greatness is necessarily synonymous with moral greatness .

		And has not the attri - buting of greatness , to which Dr.
Gould	PERSON	takes exception , been made , not to
Hearn	PERSON	himself , but to his writings , -- and in particular to his books about
Japan	LOCATION	, which Dr.
Gould	PERSON	aptly calls '' a benefaction and a delight to the entire world '' ?

		The many admirers of
Hearn	ORGANIZATION	's books need no longer rest under any misapprehension as to the mental make-up of the author .

		Of character , defined as '' the action or reaction of personality against circumstance , not under and dominated by circumstance , '' we are told that he had none whatever .

		This is how Dr.
Gould	PERSON	sums up his characteristics : '' His was the most unresisting , most echolike mind I have ever known .

		He was a perfect chameleon ; he took for the time the color of his surroundings .

		He was always the mirror of the friend of the instant , or , if no friend was there , of the dream of that instant .

		The next minute he was another being ; acted upon by the new cir - cumstance , reflecting the new friend , or redreaming the old and new-found dream .

		They who blame him too sharply for his disloyalty and ingratitude to old friends do not imderstand him psychologically .

		There was nothing behind the physical and neurologic machine to be loyal or disloyal ... He had no mind , or character , to be possessed of loyalty or disloyalty ... One does not ask originality or even great consistency of an echo , and of all men that have ever lived ,
Hearn	PERSON	, mentally and spiritually , was most perfectly an echo .

		The sole quality , the only originality he brought to the fact , or to the echo , was color -- a peculiar derivation of a maimed sense .

		He created or invented nothing ; his stories were always told him by others ... His merit , almost his sole merit , and his unique skill , lay in the strange facultj '' ^ of coloring the echo .

		... So that , fused as he was with his work , he himself became that impossible thing , a chromatic voice , a multicolored echo . ''

		Again and again are these things recurred to in the course of the book .

		Many of them are explained by
Hearn	ORGANIZATION	's defective vision ; others by the constitution of his mind , '' improcreant by inheritance and by education , by necessity and by training , by poverty internal and external . ''

		And yet , we are told , '' two attributes are beyond all analysis '' : '' One was a thing illogical with his character , his cleaving to an ideal of literary workmanship at the cost of selfishness , friendships , and temporary success ; and the other was his marvellous literary and psychologic sympathy with whatever mind , people , circumstance , story , or tradition , accident or choice brought before the echoing or mirroring mind . ''

		But do these attributes defy analysis ?

		Do they not negative the assertion that
Hearn	PERSON	's mind was '' without creative ability ,
spring	DATE	, or the desire for it '' ?

		It may be rash to differ from one who not only knew
Hearn	PERSON	intimately , but whose opportunities for insight have been excep
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 301 tional .

		Yet it seems clear enough that with all his limitations and disabilities
Hearn	PERSON	had never - theless within him a compulsion essentially crea - tive in its nature .

		The scope and direction of the creative impulse were determined by his myopia .

		The only thing possible for him to do was to write ; but writing may be an art , and whatever
Hearn	PERSON	was or was not , there can be no doubt that he was an artist .

		He may not have originated his stories , but he did create the beautiful vesture of words in which he presented them to the world .

		The mistake Dr.
Gould	PERSON	makes would seem to be the familiar one of regarding the content of works of art as insep - arable from the form , and of failing to perceive that the creative work of the artist may be , and indeed most frequently is , wholly spent upon the latter .

		On the whole , the picture of
Hearn	ORGANIZATION	drawn by Dr.
Gould	PERSON	does not differ materially from that to which we were accustomed .

		It is a little sharper in outline , a little more explicit in detail , that is all .

		Some mistakes have been corrected , and doubt is expressed as to the au - thenticity of the story of
Hearn	ORGANIZATION	's early years as given in his '' Life and Letters . ''

		There is a welcome list of unsigned editorials contributed by
Hearn	PERSON	to the
New Orleans	LOCATION	'' Times-Democrat , '' one or two of which are reprinted , together with a number of excerpts from letters and other writings .

		Somewhat more than half of the volume is taken up by Dr.
Goidd	PERSON	's interesting series of '' epitomes '' of all of
Hearn	ORGANIZATION	's books ; and a full bibliography compiled by Miss
Laura Stedman	PERSON	, which includes unpublished works in manu - script , papers contributed to periodicals , books and critical articles about
Hearn	PERSON	, and a long list of his translations printed in the
New Orleans	LOCATION	'' Times-Democrat . ''

		These are valuable features which can hardly fail of wide appreciation .


Frederick W. Gookin	PERSON	.

		The Hobo in Theory and Practice .

		* Two recently published books about the Tramp -LRB- or the Hobo , or the Vagrant , as one may choose to caU him -RRB- are interesting because they deal with the matter in rather a comple - mentary way , one handling the topic theoreti - cally and the other practically .

		Mr.
Edmond Kelly	PERSON	has thought the matter out , and provides • The Elimination op the Tramp .

		By
Edmond Kelly	PERSON	.

		New York :
G. P. Patnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		The Road .

		By
Jack London	PERSON	.

		New York :
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		a scientific monograph ; Mr.
Jack London	PERSON	has personally gone through the experience and pro- vides a romantic reminiscence .

		We recommend both books to the inquirer .

		Mr.
Kelly	PERSON	gives a study of the subject based on the system by which
Switzerland	LOCATION	has suc - ceeded in putting a practical end to vagrancy , and offers an adaptation of it to our conditions .

		He urges the necessity of some plan by means of which a magistrate -- police judge or other -- may be able to deal with all homeless men brought before him in a manner more just and useful than the simple sending everyone who can not pay a fine to the jail or penitentiary .

		There are aU sorts of people who may become vagrants for the time being , but especially three kinds .

		There are men who can work and wish to work if they can find employment , men who can not or will not do regular work on account of age or other cause , and men who do not want to work and will not if they can help it .

		The last only are the true wanderers , vagrants , tramps , hoboes .

		Of the first class there have been many this past winter .

		Mr.
Kelly	PERSON	thinks that the best thing to do for them is to devise some means by which such men can show that they really are working - men , and then to maintain them till they can be helped to some regular employment .

		The other classes make up the people for whom some sort of institutional plan seems necessary .

		Several European countries -LRB- small ones -RRB- han - dle this problem by means of farm-colonies .

		Mr.
Kelly	PERSON	gives an account of the Swiss system , which he believes to be the best .

		It con - sists essentially of one kind of colony to which are sent those who can and will do some sort of work , and another kind to which are sent those who do not wish to work but must be made to .

		If a man is really a working-man and can prove it -LRB- in
Switzerland	LOCATION	by a '' traveller 's relief - book '' -RRB- , the judge has no business with him .

		If a man is really a vagrant , but is willing and able to do some work , the judge can send him to a place where there is work that he can do .

		If a man be a true hobo , the judge can send him to a '' forced labor colony , '' where he will be made to work .

		If a man be sent to a forced labor colony for a term , he is afterward given the option of going to a free labor colony .

		If he wants to go , he has really made a start in becoming a decent workingman or laborer .

		If he refuses to go and returns to the road he will pretty soon come before a magistrate again , and the same thing will occur over again , except that he may then take the chance of going to the free labor colony 302 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, and be reformed .

		If he continue refractory , however , he can be dealt with , not as a tramp but as a criminal .

		Such being the plan offered by Mr.
Kelly	PERSON	, Mr.
Jack London	PERSON	's book gives an idea of the kind of people that such a plan must provide for in this country .

		On the face of it , Mr.
London	LOCATION	would seem to have been a hobo not for any literary or academic reason but because he liked to be , -- in fact for the same reason that any - one else might be .

		And this fact gives his book certain advantages and disadvantages as a docu - ment for anyone who wishes to study closely the phenomena of tramp life .

		It has , on the one hand , very considerable knowledge of the subject , but on the other it has the obvious unreliability of such a source .

		As to the matter of knowledge , of course such people think they know every - thing about their own way of life .

		A hobo always presents himself as '' wise , '' and Mr.
Jack London	PERSON	, like the rest , knows an extraordinary amount , although he does sometimes confess ignorance .

		As to the reliability of his informa - tion , he tells us himself of half a dozen times when he lied for his own advantage , and it will be a credulous reader who does not at least sus - pect the possibility of becoming one case more .

		Still , looking at the book with severely criti - cal eyes , one gets a picture of a person very difficidt to reform .

		Mr.
Kelly	PERSON	's plan works in
Switzerland	LOCATION	, and his adaptation to American conditions seems sound ; but the tramp , as
Jack London	PERSON	pictures himself and others , appears to us to need more vigorous treatment than a farm colony .

		One has to search diligently through the book to find any quality or trait -LRB- not purely physical -RRB- that is not vicious .

		Mr.
Jack London	PERSON	in his tramp days was , of course , a professional beggar and thief , and lived by what he could get out of the good-hearted and foolish .

		But he was otherwise a poor type .

		He tells us -LRB- among other such matters -RRB- how he made friends with a man for what he could get out of him and de - serted him at the first possible minute .

		He tells us how he joined a set of people and sold them out the first chance he got , and then sold out those who helped him sell out the others .

		He does not seem to have been a person who would be much improved by a farm-colony , even with forced labor .

		It does not seem probable that Mr.
Jack London	PERSON	would be much impressed with the plan that Mr.
Kelly	PERSON	proposes .

		Nor does Mr.
Kelly	PERSON	seem to consider just the type that Mr.
London	LOCATION	presents in his reminiscences .

		As to the value of what a third party may think -LRB- no specialist on either side -RRB- , there will be much doubt .

		With some diffidence , therefore , we propound some objections , with the idea of bringing the matter as fully to view as possible .

		And first as to the honest workman .

		The idea of identification is a very desirable one , but very difficult to carry out .

		For anyone who gives an identification-book or card can also withhold it .

		And as the proof that a man is a working-man must in general come from the person he has worked for , it will be seen that the plan gives a good deal of power to the employer .

		Mr.
Kelly	PERSON	recognizes this difficulty , but attaches less weight to it than we are inclined to .

		Passing that point , however , it shoidd be noted that the establishment of real municipal lodging-houses is not yet common , -- in fact , it is in the dim future .

		In most cities to-day there is no regular way of looking after an honest man out of work .

		This winter thousands have had to beg , and many have gone a step farther .

		In regard to farm-colonies in general , it is pretty clear that the plan is not in accord with the genius of the American hobo , who is not of the agricultural period of development , but is a sort of Ishmaelitish city-dweller .

		In other words , it is probable that the keeping him on a farm - colony would be a serious matter .

		And if the farm-colonies became practically penitentiaries the matter would not be much ahead of present conditions .

		Of course what the tramp needs is moral regeneration , and this reminds one natu - rally of General Booth 's '' Darkest England '' colony-plan .

		But this plan we need not discuss here .

		In theory it was not so very different from Mr.
KeUy	PERSON	's plan ; yet it was proposed twenty years ago , has had a great deal of money spent upon it , and is not to-day so striking a success that Mr.
Kelly	PERSON	even mentions it .

		We think , jn fine , that Mr.
Kelly	PERSON	's plan would be an improvement on present conditions , but we can not think that it would eliminate the tramp .

		The tramp to-day is the result of con - ditions of our civilization that must change before their present results pass away .

		THE DIAL 303 FYNES MORYSON : ELIZABETHAN Traveller .

		* The handsome volumes of Mory son 's valuable '' Itinerary , '' now coming from the press of Messrs.
James MacLehose & Sons	ORGANIZATION	,
Glasgow	LOCATION	, are doubly welcome ; for they not only make easily accessible a book of travel well worth know - ing , but also show that the bold venture of Mr.
Charles Hughes	PERSON	in issuing -LRB- in
1903	DATE	-RRB- his ''
Shakespeare	PERSON	's
Europe	LOCATION	: Unpublished Chapters of
Fynes Moryson	ORGANIZATION	's Itinerary '' has awakened enough of interest in the traveller to cause the reprinting of the older work .

		The original '' Itinerary '' appeared in
1617	DATE	, in a stately folio of nearly 900 pages , under the segis of
John Beale	PERSON	, dwelling at
London	LOCATION	in Aldersgate street .

		The new edition is to be completed in four volumes , with a brief '' pub - lishers ' note '' about the life of Mory son , and with a full index , a feature sadly missed by all who knew the old edition .

		Otherwise we are promised a faithful reprint of the original work '' except that the letters i , j , u , and v have been altered to conform to modern usage , and obvious printers ' errors , both of spelling and punctuation , have been corrected '' Mr.
Hughes	PERSON	gave us what he regarded as the most valuable portions of the manuscript which Mory son left unprinted .

		The pious wish of the worthy traveller was thus in part fulfilled some three hundred years after he had , as we may well believe , abandoned the vain search for a publisher . ''

		Shakespeare 's
Europe	LOCATION	'' follows the manuscript faithfully , except for obvious slips of the pen , even to the letters i , j , u , and v , thus reproducing the sincere and catholic spelling of the old '' Itinerary . ''

		The editor has made us his debtors by giving us a valuable Introduction , but failed , alas !

		to add the full index .

		Passages quoted below from the '' Itinerary '' follow the original edi - tion , as the reprint has , at this writing , not progressed far enough to supply all of them ; but the paging of the old has fortimately been indicated in the new edition .

		Shortly after the publication of '' Shake - speare 's
Europe	LOCATION	, '' it was my good fortune to take up both of
Moryson	ORGANIZATION	's works at the close of a fresh perusal of the genuine unabridged
Pepys	PERSON	's `` Diary '' of
Wheatley	ORGANIZATION	's ample pages .

		Surely it was not the mere chance of proximity that made the men appear as much alike as a staid older * An Itineraky .

Bohmerland	LOCATION	,

		and a frolicsome younger brother .

		To be sure , the Clerk of the Acts of the days of Charles II .

		may not seem at first glance to have much in common with the smug and pedantic tourist of the days of good Queen
Bess	PERSON	.

		The diarist bares his soul as no man before or after him ; and therefore the trim , precise , and rigid figure of the traveller , as he reveals himself in his own pages , may fail at first to suggest kinship with dear , honest , `` grafting , '' patriotic , truthful , lying , loving , licentious
Sam Pepys	PERSON	.

		The ex - ternal resemblance is , of course , closer to the
Samuel Pepys	PERSON	of
Braybooke	ORGANIZATION	's supplement , where solemn papers , letters , and memoranda almost make us lose the diarist in the Clerk of the Acts .

		Moryson is , nevertheless , an older
Pepys	PERSON	, who reveals the similarity , if in nothing else , in his wide-ranging curiosity , and in his sane and lucid , though unornamented , English .

		The personal equation , as necessary to know in the case of the traveller as of the diarist , is for the most part easily ascertainable for Mory - son .

		Even the industry of his editor has dis - covered little more about him than he has himself told .

		When the
Fellow of Peterhouse College	ORGANIZATION	,
Cambridge	LOCATION	, set sail for Stade , in
1591	DATE	, to begin his first journey on the continent , he was already old enough -LRB- he was bom in
1566	DATE	-RRB- to have most of his convictions firmly settled .

		As the third son of a numerous family , his financial prospects by way of inheritance were small .

		Of suffi - ciently bold and active spirit , we may believe that , despite the labored reasons which he gives for his undertaking , the real motive was the desire of change and adventure ; for travelling in
Europe	LOCATION	was then no mere holiday excursion .

		In its risk of death or captivity , and in its dangers by land and sea , it was more comparable -LRB- though the mere comparison is , of course , an exaggeration -RRB- with a journey into the heart of
Africa	LOCATION	to-day .

		The gambling spirit of the time regarded the odds against safe return as at least three to one , as may be evidenced by
Moryson	PERSON	's brother
Henry	PERSON	, who , when about to accompany him on his second voyage , put out # 400 , after a common form of speculation in those days , to receive .

		#
1200	DATE	on his return , or to lose all , -- and lost .

		Fynes staked a smaller sum in a similar way ; but though he walked
London	LOCATION	's streets again , the treachery of supposed friends cut him short of his expected gains .

		A firm will and an enterprising spirit were not
Moryson	PERSON	's sole equipment for his journey .

		The Fellow of Peterhouse was manifestly abreast of the learning of his times , priding himself as being more skilful in Latin than even the Teu - 304 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, tons , and speaking , before his return , French , German , and Italian fluently .

		A staunch Pro- testant hatred of Turks , Jews , Romish priests , Jesuits , and '' mere '' Irish , is never hidden ; while the '' English '' Irish come in for dislike only less violent .

		Everywhere through his writ - ings is revealed that spirit of condescension which even to-day so endears some travellers to the rest of the world .

		And yet at times he coidd see clearly and judge rightly of matters wherein the English came off only second-best .

		As in the case of
Pepys	PERSON	, appreciation of literary values was one of his weak points ; and if he had as frankly recorded his opinions now and then , they would doubtless have been as silly .

		Not least of his whole equipment was blindness to the beauties of art and nature .

		One delightful sen - tence -LRB- '' Itinerary , '' III. , p. 54 -RRB- , '' Sweitzerland consists of hills and
Mountaines	LOCATION	, so as they do likewise trauell on horseback , '' reveals the man like a lightning flash .

		That he had his senti - mental side we know from many little digres - sions , -- as when he lingers , for example , over the
Morosini	PERSON	family , famous in Venetian annals , '' for the Consonancy of that name '' with his own ; but the careless reader may be pardoned for seeing in him a typical stage Englishman solemnly recording his '' expences for horses and mans meat '' for the benefit of myriads of other Englishmen who should follow after him .

		Yet the very absence of most of what we look for in a modern book of travel is what makes
Moryson	PERSON	's work most valuable to the modem reader .

		Opinions about art , descriptions of scenery , attempts to give local color , we have galore , and will read none that smack of ancient days ; but the price of a sixteenth-century hen in
Poland	LOCATION	, the stockingless condition of the ladies of
Germany	LOCATION	, the laws of inheritance in
Venice	LOCATION	, -- these are topics that charm peren - nially .

		The events of
Moryson	ORGANIZATION	's life which interest us are few .

		Two journeys -LRB- separated only by some six months in
England	LOCATION	in
1595	DATE	-RRB- filled up the six years from
May 1 , 1591	DATE	, to
July 10 , 1597	DATE	.

		On the first he saw much of
the Netherlands	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	, and
Italy	LOCATION	-LRB- as far south as
Naples	LOCATION	-RRB- , with glimpses of
Poland	LOCATION	,
Bohemia	LOCATION	,
Austria	LOCATION	,
Switzerland	LOCATION	, and
France	LOCATION	; on the second and briefer , he went to
Jerusalem	LOCATION	and
European Turkey	LOCATION	by way of
Germany	LOCATION	and
Venice	LOCATION	.

		We learn also of a trip to the
North of England	LOCATION	, and a flying excursion into
Scotland	LOCATION	.

		In
1600	DATE	he accompanied
Charles Blount	PERSON	,
Lord Mountjoy	PERSON	, as a sort of secretary to the Irish wars .

		From the death of that nobleman , in
1606	DATE	, we lose about all trace of him , except for the publication of his '' Itinerary '' in
1617	DATE	.

		The industry of Mr.
Hughes	PERSON	has unearthed his will , and settled the date of his death as
February 12	DATE	, 1629-30 .

		Moryson 's worldly gear is a not uninteresting topic .

		When he set out on his first journey , his pocket was doubtless none too abundantly filled by the gifts of his father and by the annual stipend of # 20 from Peterhouse which he con - tinued to draw for a number of years as a travel - ling Fellow .

		But travelling was cheap in those days .

		A quotation on this point will also serve to illustrate the clearness of
Moryson	ORGANIZATION	's style , as weU as his tinge of pedantry and insular conceit -LRB- '' Itinerary , '' III. , p. 13 -RRB- : '' Fifty or sixty pounds sterling yeerely , were suffi - cient at the time when I was beyond sea , to beare the charge of a Trauellers diet , necessary apparrell , and two ioumies yeerely , in the
Spring	DATE	and Autumne , and also to serue him for moderate expences of pleasure , so that hee imitated not the Germans , who drinke and banquet as much abroad , as at home , nor the Italians , who liue they among Christians or Pagans , yet can not restraine their incontinency ; nor the Polonians , who being perhaps the sonnes of
Castellani	PERSON	, -LRB- I meane such as liaue the keep - ing of Castles , or like entertainments from the King onely for their life -RRB- , commonly spend more prodigally in
Italy	LOCATION	, and lite places , then at home , so as many times they spend their whole patrimony abroad .

		In which kind I can not but commend our Countrunen , who howsoeuer at home they may haue spent prodigally , yet going beyond seas , rather dispose their expences to repaire this former prodigalitie then otherwise and practise the rule of the Poet , .

		^ Intra f ortunam quamque manere suam : Each man his cote to fit , As his cloth will permit . ''

		His father died while he was on his first journey , leaving him bequests which amounted to about X500 , according to Mr.
Hughes	PERSON	.

		After the Irish war we hear of a pension of six shillings a day .

		Though his wiU reveals neither money nor lands , he seems to have lived in his latter years the peaceful and easy life of the unmarried scholar , doubtless pottering over his books and manuscripts to the very end .

		An amusing passage in his account of his visit to
Loreto	LOCATION	throws unexpected light on his reason - able content with his fortunes .

		Loreto brought all his Protestant zeal to a white glow , and it is a pity that we must be content with the quota - tion of a few lines of his narrative -LRB- '' Itinerary , '' I. , p. 100 -RRB- : '' When we came forth -LRB- as the Italians prouerbially speake of the Priests auarice ,
Euery Psalme	ORGANIZATION	ends in Glory he , ^ c. as if they should say .

		All religion to end in profit -RRB- it was necessarie for vs to cast almes into an iron chest behind the Altar , couered with an iron grate .

		Therefore , my consorts , of purpose to delight the Priests eares with the sound of money , as with musicke , did cast into that chest many brasse quatrines , but of small value , and my self e being last , when my turne was
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 305 to gfiue almes , did in stead thereof , gather some teane quatirnes -LSB- sic -RSB- of theirs , which lay scattered upon the grate , and got that cleare gaine by that IdoU .

		God forbid I should bragge of any contempt to Religion ; but since it appears , that such worship is vnpleasing to God : and because Papists will haue all their miracles beleeued , I will freely say by experience , that hauing gotten these few quatirnes in such sort as I said , yet after that , God of his mercy preserued me in my long and dangerous trauell , and from that time to this day , by his grace , I haue enioyed , though no abundant , yet a competent estate , and more plentifuU then in my former dayes . ''

		Mory son 's published '' Itinerary '' is divided into three parts of about equal length .

		The first is the Itinerary proper , -- a narrative of his daily route , the cost of food and horse hire , the enu - meration of the things seen at each place , at first sight as unpromising as
Pepys	PERSON	's record , but not unlike it in the interest which suddenly appears in the midst of the dullest narrative .

		The second part is an account of the Irish war , in which Mory son had a modest share .

		The third deals voluminously with such topics as the geography , traffic , diet , apparel , military forces , laws , and rulers of the states through which he passed .

		The manuscript which Mr.
Hughes	PERSON	has given us in print is , so far as published , essen - tially a continuation of the third part , dwelling at greater length on social institutions and usages .

		Different portions of the two books have differ - ent values .

		Mory son was both an observer and a compiler .

		Where he observes most , -- as in
Germany	LOCATION	,
Venice	LOCATION	,
Florence	LOCATION	, and
Turkey	LOCATION	, -- he is most valuable and interesting .

		Where he com - piles most , -- as in his long description of
Rome	LOCATION	, where , for fear of the priests , he dared stay only four days , -- he is most a bore .

		In several re - spects , too , he travelled at an auspicious time , knowing intimately the
Germany	LOCATION	of the good old days before the Thirty Years ' War , visiting
Turkey	LOCATION	when it was still a menace to
Europe	LOCATION	, and justly conscious , so soon after the defeat of the Spanish Armada , of the proud position of his own country .

		An Englishman of
Pepys	PERSON	's days would have seen a vastly different
Europe	LOCATION	and a humbled
England	LOCATION	.

		To the sober-minded reader , portions of Mr.
Hughes	PERSON	's publication , particularly those concern - ing
Germany	LOCATION	and
Turkey	LOCATION	, offer much valuable information not obtainable elsewhere .

		But far be it from us to commend Moryson merely on such utilitarian grounds .

		The lowest and basest of the reasons for accepting gratefully such a book is surely its usefulness .

		If there be those who , taking up the journal of the Clerk of the Acts , would rather read sometimes of the rising price of tickets to the pit , or of how Mrs.
Pepys	PERSON	made ready to apply the red-hot tongs to the nose of her erring though repentant husband , than of the voyage of Charles II .

		back to the
England	LOCATION	which he disgraced , they may find material to their liking in
Moryson	ORGANIZATION	's pages , though doubtless less delightsome .

		It will depend whoUy on the taste of the reader whether he regards the '' Itinerary '' or its continuation as the more enjoyable .

		More useful the latter certainly is for everyone in search of solid information .

		In this necessary division of opinion , and in view of the fact that ''
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's
Europe	LOCATION	'' has been accessible for several years , while the '' Itinerary '' has yet to gain its friends in its new form , we may find our excuse for confining ourselves hereafter ex - clusively to the latter .

		Unfortunately , there is not space to quote
Moryson	PERSON	's ambitious scheme of what the traveller should observe .

		He bids him note -LRB- III. , p. 10 -RRB- the fertility of the soil and its products , the mines of metals and precious stones , the abund - ance and kinds of food with the cost thereof , '' the rare and proper Beasts , ' costumes , habits , laws , '' the magnificence of Citizens , their house - hold stuffe , and in generall all speciall ` things , as
Statuaes	LOCATION	,
Colosses	LOCATION	, Sepulchers with the in - scriptions , Lybraries with the most rare Bookes , Theaters , Arches , Bridges , Forts , Armories , Treasuries , Monasteries , Churches , publicke houses ,
Vniuersities	PERSON	, with their Founders , re - uenewes , and disputations , '' rulers , religion , commerce , and lastly coins -LRB- for him a fascinat - ing topic -RRB- .

		Such a scheme is as generous as it is impossible , particularly for him who was as unmoved by literature or the fine arts as a man color-blind woidd be in a modem picture-gallery .

		After all , his was no purpose to entertain merely , for , to let him speak in his own words : '' I pro- fesse to write especially in this place to the Hu - manist , I meane him that affects the knowledge of State affaires , Histories ,
Cosmography	ORGANIZATION	, and the like , and out of that I write , let other men apply to their vse , what they iudge fit for them . ''

		At the beginning of Part III .

		he has a dis - cussion of the proper persons to travel , which is especially valuable in these restless days when we all rush over-seas .

		Unlike Plato , he decides against old men from fifty to threescore , on account of their liability to fatal illness and their proneness to run into vice .

		Nor may women and children go , and married men only for a brief season . ''

		But as in all actions they are happy that hold the meane , so middle age is most fit to visit forraigne parts , and to make vse thereof , hauing first laid a good foundation 806 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, of Arts and Sciences in general !

		, and specially those which they meane to professe , and being of so ripe discretion , as they can distinguish betweene good and euill . ''

		This passage , which might easily be paralleled by others from older English literature , helps to show how curiously we have now removed the boundary between middle and old age .

		Has the span of human life really grown greater ?

		Moryson , writing in all soberness long after the event , evidently meant himself when he spoke of the middle - aged scholar as best fitted for travel , though he was only about twenty-five at the beginning of his journey abroad and not much over thirty on his return .

		Like many before him , he con - sidered fifty as the border of old age .

		Moryson esteemed the Germans greatly , and gave much space to them .

		He admired their learning , industry , frugality , and honesty , but thought them quarrelsome , prone to scold their wives , and little given to politeness .

		Their drinking habits left him in endless amazement .

		He must have enjoyed life in
Italy	LOCATION	most , if we may judge by the amount of space he gave that country , praising the Italians for their polite - ness and amiability , but condemning them for dishonesty , cowardice , and incontinency .

		The Turk , then at the height of his insolence , if not of his power , called forth some of the most in - structive passages of both books .

		Of one theme , -- his own land , its inns and its men , even when they travel , -- he never tired , though his comments are never long and almost never odious . ''

		I haue obserued the Germans and French in
Italy	LOCATION	, to liue and conuerse most with their owne Countrimen , disdaining to apply themselues to the Italians language , apparrell , and diet , and the English aboue all others , to subiect themselues to the
Lawes	PERSON	, customes , language , and apparrell of other
Nations	ORGANIZATION	.

		And hence it is that the conuersation of the English abroad is wonderfuUie pleasing vnto strangers .

		Onely because they are forced to dissemble their Countrie among Papists , I haue found by experience , that other Nations , whose habit and name they take , haue reaped the commendation of this their vertue ; and it is certaine , that the Germanes , whom the English do often personate , haue thereupon beene often praysed in forraigne parts for their temperance , and other vertues lesse proper to them . ''

		-LRB- III. , p. 23 . -RRB-

		In this necessity under which the English labored , of having to take the habit and name of other nations , we have an allusion to the religious differences which color every page of the book .

		When
Moryson	PERSON	returned to
England	LOCATION	in Italian costume , constables waited outside the inn to arrest him , taking him for a Jesuit or a priest .

		In
Italy	LOCATION	, travel was possible for him only in the disguise of a Roman Catholic Ger - man ; and he fled from
Rome	LOCATION	after a stay of only four days , for fear that the special intoler - ance of Easter might bring him to a prison cell .

		Yet we find unexpected toleration in parts of
Southern Germany	LOCATION	and
Bohemia	LOCATION	, for the Thirty Years ' War was as yet only a distant menace .

		What we may call his asides are often inter - esting portions of
Moryson	ORGANIZATION	's narrative , as illus - trating some idiosyncrasy of the man , or as wonderfully pertinent glosses on the history of the lif -LRB- ; and customs of the times .

		We have already seen him pleasantly employed with the Morosinis of
Venice	LOCATION	.

		It is less pleasant to learn of his acquiring the unbreakable habit of going about with downcast eyes , because `` a Turke will not abide any Christian to looke him full in the face without striking him . ''

		Some - times we rim across an unexpected bit of senti - ment , as in the story of the Florentine Juliet who kept her Romeo -LRB- I. , p. 148 -RRB- : '' Neere that place lies a lane vupaued , in memory of a Virgin that dwelt there , whom a yong man loued , who was borne of a Family of a contrarie faction to hers , between whom many cruelties had been exercised , and they mutually louing each other , & despairing to get their friends consent for marriage , and at last being impatient of delay , resolued with what danger soeuer to meet together .

		But it happened , that the yong man being to ascend into the Virgins Chamber by a ladder , was surprised , who to saue the reputation of the Virgin , confessed that he came to rob the house , whereupon he was condemned to die , and being led to execution by the house where the Virgin dwelt , she laying aside all shame , came running out , with her loose haire about her eares , and embracing him , confessed the truth publikly , with which accident both their parents were so moued , as laying aside all former malice they contracted affinity , and the yoing man deliuered from the bonds of the hangman , was tied to her in the sweet bond of marriage .

		And of this wonderful euent , the
Florentines	LOCATION	thought good to keepe this memorie for posteritie . ''

		So , too , these comments illuminate the man - ner of life of the day , -- the unglazed windows of
Italy	LOCATION	; the bench or floor that offered the only chance for sleep in rural Polish inns ; the awful upper and nether feather beds of
Germany	LOCATION	, where the traveller suffered with his chance companion of the night ; the heated common dining-rooms of German inns , where men actually sat bare - headed ; the skates of HoUand , for which he had no name ; customs '' proper to the English , as the muffling a mans face with his cloke '' ; the '' Vmbrels , or things like a little Canopy ouer their heads , '' which men carry in
Italy	LOCATION	against the heat , though their use is dangerous , '' because they gather the heate into a pyramidall point , and thence cast it downe perpendicularly vpon the head , except they know how to carry them for auoyding that danger . ''

		What visions of
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 307 things ixnutterable lie in the simple statement : '' At the table , they -LSB- i.e. , the Italians , but some - thing similar is said of the French elsewhere -RSB- touch no meate with the hand , but with a forke of siluer or other metall , each man being serued with his forke and spoone , and glasse to drinke . ''

		His was in many ways another
England	LOCATION	; but who does not recall
Pepys	PERSON	, muffling his face in his mantel , or proud , on occasion , to wear his hat ceremoniously indoors ?


Charles Harris	PERSON	.

		The Dynasts .

		* It is a century since the epos of the Napoleonic wars filled the thoughts of mankind , and we are now only beginning to understand the events of those portentous years , and to view them in their true historical perspective .

		It may well be that another century shall pass before men are able to view in true literary perspective , and to praise aright , the colossal drama which Mr.
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	has consecrated to the Napoleonic theme .

		When the first section of '' The Dynasts '' was published , some four years since , the impression made by it was chiefly one of bewilderment .

		The second section deepened that impression , and brought with it a more definite sense of the power displayed .

		With the third section , now completing the work , we become conscious of a precipitation , still somewhat cloudy , of the aesthe - tical , ethical , and philosophical elements hitherto held in solution , and we feel that a gi-eat task has been worthily performed .

		How worthily , and to what enduring effect , the distant future must be left to decide .

		Here , at least , is the vision vouchsafed to one of the greatest spirits of our time , brooding for many years over one of the most extraordinary themes presented by the history of the modern world .

		That the out - come of such a preoccupation should be mere futility we can not for a moment believe .

		What - ever deductions criticism may hereafter make for ruggedness of form , incoherence of structure , and preposterous scenic investiture , there will always remain the sense of a great conception , power - fully presented , and endowed by its creator ynth .

		a strange kind of life .

		The three parts of '' The Dynasts '' comprise nineteen acts and one hundred and thirty scenes .

		The hmnan characters are numbered by the hun - dreds , and to these are superadded the Phantom Intelligences that hover over the scene , and dis - * The Dynasts .

		Part Third .

		New course upon it sub specie cetemitatis .

		It is to them that we must turn for whatever poetry we may expect to find in the work , for only a scant fraction of its bulk is to be described as being poetry at all .

		Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	's intellectual mastery is such that he can at times force poetry to his will , but the product is never quite without traces of the violence employed .

		We feel about him as we feel about
Emerson	PERSON	and
Whitman	PERSON	, that the stuff of poetry is in him , but coupled with the obstinate determination not to submit to its formal restraints .

		The poetical high - water mark of the entire work was probably reached in the comment of the Chorus of Pities upon the Walcheren expedition in Part II .

		-LRB- quoted in
The Dial	ORGANIZATION	, May 16,1906 -RRB- .

		Nothing quite equal to that in haunting and melancholy beauty is to be found in the volume now at hand .

		And yet there are single lines of infinite suggestiveness , such as the pathetic '' Disasters mostly have to do with ine '' of the Empress
Marie Louise	PERSON	; brief passages of biting force or amazing vision , such as these words of Davout at first sight of
Moscow	LOCATION	i '' What scores of bulbous church-tops gild the sky !

		Souls must be rotten in this region , sire , To need so much repairing ! ''

		or these of the Spirit of the Pities upon the field of
Waterloo	LOCATION	: '' Between the jars Of those who live , I hear uplift and move The bones of those who placidly have lain Within the sacred garths of yon grey fanes --
Nivelles	LOCATION	and Plancenoit , and others nigh .

		Where faith is vibrant still -- through untold years .

		Their dry jaws quake : ` What Sabaoth is this , That shakes us in our unobtrusive shrouds .

		As though our tissues did not yet abhor The fevered feats of life ? ' ''

		Probably the finest long passage is offered by the last monologue of
Napoleon	PERSON	, fleeing for his life after the final defeat of his insensate ambi - tion .

		It is
midnight	TIME	, he is drowsing in the saddle , and the voice of the
Spirit Ironic	ORGANIZATION	penetrates to his consciousness with the question : '' So I would ask ,
Ajaccian Bonaparte	PERSON	, Has all this been worth while ? ''

		Here is the monologue in full : '' O cursed hour .

		Why am I stung by spectral questionings ?

		Did not my clouded soul incline to match Those of the corpses yonder , thou should ` st rue Thy saying .

		Fiend , whoever thou may ` st be !

		... Why did the death-drops fail to bite me close I took at
Fontainebleau	LOCATION	?

		Had I then ceased This deep had been unplumbed ; had they but worked , I had thrown three-fold the glow of Hannibal Down History 's dusky lanes !

		-- Is it too late ?

		... Yea .

		Self-sought death would smoke but damply here !

		308 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, If but a
Kremlin	ORGANIZATION	cannon shot had met me My greatness would have stood : I should have scored A vast repute , scarce paralleled in time .

		As it did not , the fates had served me best If in the thick and thunder of to-day ,
Like Nelson	PERSON	,
Harold	PERSON	,
Hector	LOCATION	,
Cyrus	PERSON	,
Saul	PERSON	, I had been shifted from this jail of flesh .

		To wander as a greatened ghost elsewhere .

		Yes , a good death , to have died on yonder field ; But never a ball came passing down my way !

		So , as it is , a miss-mark they will dub me ; And yet -- I found the crown of
France	LOCATION	in the mire , And with the point of my prevailing sword I picked it up !

		But for all this and this I shall be nothing ... To shoulder Christ from out the topmost niche In human fame , as once I fondly felt .

		Was not for me .

		I came too late in time To assume the prophet or the demi-god , A part past playing now .

		My only course To make good showance to posterity Was to implant my line upon the throne .

		And how shape that , if now extinction nears ?

		Great men are meteors that consume themselves To light the earth .

		This is my burnt-out hour . ''

		The seven acts which this closing section of the work comprises deal with the Russian expedition , the final passages of the Peninsular campaign , the defeat of
Leipzig	LOCATION	, the exile to
Elba	PERSON	, and the Belgian campaign that ended on the field of
Waterloo	LOCATION	.

		Many scenes of subor - dinate interest are interspersed , taking us , now to
London	LOCATION	, now to
Malmaison	LOCATION	, now to the
Wessex	ORGANIZATION	coast , now to
Vienna	LOCATION	and
Schonbrunn	ORGANIZATION	.

		The stage-directions are more amazing than ever , as the following examples witness : '' The unnatural light before seen usurps that of the sun , bringing into view , Uke breezes made visible , the .

		films or brain-tissues of the Immanent Will , that pervade all things , ramifying through the whole army .

		Napoleon included , and moving them to Its inexplicable artistries . '' ''

		Thereupon a vision passes before
Napoleon	PERSON	as he lies , comprising hundreds of thousands of skeletons and corpses in various stages of decay .

		They rise from his various battlefields , the flesh dropping from them , and gaze reproachfully at him .

		His intimate officers slain he recognizes among the crowd .

		In front is the
Duke of Enghien	ORGANIZATION	as showman . ''

		The imagination that stage-directed the second part of '' Faust '' did not transcend the possible to this extent .

		As for the
Phantom Intelli	ORGANIZATION	- gences , the Spirits of Rumour , and of the Pities and of the Years , the Spirits Sinister and Ironic , they are present everywhere , commenting singly or in choral unison upon the scenes , as they are successively enacted upon the earthly stage .

		K it is to these Phantom Intelligences that we must look for the poetry of Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	's work , it is to them also that we must turn for its philosophy .

		As those who have read the earlier sections of the work already know , this is a philosophy that embodies the central doc - trine of
Schopenhauer	PERSON	-- the doctrine of a blind , unconscious , and aimless will immanent in all things , and unwitting of any definite purpose .

		`` Why prompts the Will so senseless-shaped a doing ? ''

		asks the Spirit of the Pities ; and the Spirit of the Years makes answer : '' I have told thee that It works unwittingly , As one possessed , not judging . ''

		Whatever light the author has for the darkness of his fellow-men , perplexed by the seemingly meaningless tragedy of existence , must be sought in that impressive '' After Scene '' in the
Overworld	LOCATION	, when
Europe	LOCATION	is visible only in the dim distance , and the Phantom Intelligences alone occupy the stage .

		SpiRrr OF THE Years . ''

		Thus doth the
Great Foresightless	ORGANIZATION	mechanize In blank entrancement now as evermore Its ceaseless artistries in Circumstance Of curious stuff and braid , as just forthshown .

		Yet but one flimsy riband of Its web Have we here watched in weaving -- web Enorme , Whose furthest hem and selvage may extend To where the roars and plashings of the flames Of earth-invisible suns swell noisily .

		And onwards into ghastly gulfs of sky .

		Where hideous presences churn through the dark -- Monsters of magnitude without a shape , Hanging amid deep wells of nothingness .

		Here may be noted Mr.

		With the German philosopher , the Will may attain to consciousness only in its indi - vidual objectification , and then only to the effect of an act of negation and consequent world - annihUation ; with the English poet the Will may become conscious in its cosmic character , and acquire positive purpose wherewith to shape a more rational world .

		The distinction is fun - damental .

		And thus the Will is invoked by the Pities in chorus : '' We hold that Thy unscanted scope Affords a food for final Hope , That mild-eyed Consciousness stands nigh Life 's loom , to lull it by and by . ''

		The
American Nation	ORGANIZATION	: 1865-1907 .

		* The appearance of the Index volume of '' The American Nation '' brings to a close a work that long before its completion has commended itself to all students of American history .

		The scholarship which has characterized the series as a whole , the convenient and tasteful form in which the volumes have been presented to the public , and the prompt - ness with which the publication has been carried through , have elicited admiration which is hardly qualified by the necessity of reading ten thousand pages , by the possible loss of individuality incident to a cooperative history , or by the repetition which is unavoidable in a work of this kind .

		Of the six volumes now before us , four contain the narrative of the
United States	LOCATION	from the Civil War to the present time , one is an index , and one is an essay , by the editor , upon American history .

		The first volume of this group covers the period of Recon - struction , and in it Professor
Dunning	PERSON	, whose essays on Reconstruction have for a decade stimulated all students of this period in our history , has written , in an easy and attractive style , another book that will be a necessary guide to students in this especial field .

		him to use them ; and it is of interest to compare the longer and the more concise treatments of the same epoch .

		Of late years no field of American history has been more industriously exploited than this Recon - struction period , -- especially with reference to the fate of individual States .

		The resulting monographs Professor
Dunning	PERSON	has used with discriminating care .

		Besides , he has broken the path into some new and important sources , notably the papers of
Andrew Johnson	PERSON	in the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		But behind all this is the thoughtful consideration which the author for many years has given to the problems of that time .

		The result is a fresh treatment which in many ways departs from the traditional accounts , which is marked by the absence of doctrinaire asser - tions , and reveals a detached yet sympathetic feeling .

		Thus , in the case of the labor laws of the
Southern States	LOCATION	, passed at the very close of the war , it is emphasized by Professor
Dunning	PERSON	that while such legislation was not tactful politically , and some examples of it were to be condemned as cruel and oppressive , the general purpose in the minds of those who enacted this body of law was an entirely reason - able and just one .

		Again , the quarrel between President
Johnson	PERSON	and
Congress	ORGANIZATION	is relieved to some extent of the intensely personal character which has attached to it , by the recognition of the fact that there was a more fundamental question involved , -- the conflict of the executive with the legislative branch of the government .

		Notwithstanding the necessary compression of a volume which has so much to tell , one of its most delightful features is the description of the person - alities which in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	or in ofiice swayed the
Nation	ORGANIZATION	's thought .

		The great trio ,
Thaddeus Stevens	PERSON	,
Charles Sumner	PERSON	, and
Henry Wilson	PERSON	, are handled without much reverence .

		In the case of the first , '' a keen and relentlessly logical mind , an ever ready gift of biting sarcasm and stinging repartee , and a total lack of scruple as to means in the pursuit of a legislative end , secured him an ascendency in the
House	ORGANIZATION	which none of his party associates ever dreamed of disputing . ''

		Sumner , however , `` made himself felt in a far different way .

		His forte was exalted moral fervor and humanitarian idealism .

		He lived in the empyrean , and descended thence upon his colleagues with dogmas that he discovered there ... He was the perfect type of that narrow fanaticism which erudition and egotism combine to produce , and to which political crises alone give the opportunity for actual achievement . ''


Henry Wilson	PERSON	's `` sympathy for the down-trodden was no less demonstrative than his colleague 's , '' but his '' tears in their flow never for a moment distorted his count of the votes to be gained for his party . ''

		Finally ,
George S. Boutwell	PERSON	is described as '' desti - tute of Sumner 's erudition and egotism and of
Wilson	PERSON	's cant , but exemplifying perfectly the hard merciless type which the Puritan conscience makes of a mediocre man . ''

		This volume extends through the two administra - 810 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, tions of Grant , with their varying currents of politics , to the disputed election of
1876	DATE	, and the decision rendered by the electoral
Commission	ORGANIZATION	in favor of
Hayes	LOCATION	.

		The story of the failure of Reconstruction in the
South	LOCATION	gives place to that of the economic development of the North and the depressing public scandals that disgraced the Republican rule .

		There is a chapter upon the judicial interpretation of Reconstruction : and if any fault-iinding were in order , we might be disposed to place it here and ask for a larger expression of Professor
Dunning	PERSON	's judgment as an historian on the relation to the facts of Reconstruction of the theories as to the location of sovereignty in the
United States	LOCATION	which different writers or different parties advanced .

		Perhaps this question has been anticipated , and the answer sug - gested , by Professor
Dunning	PERSON	, when he says that `` the final steps in reconstruction revealed with unmistakable clearness the truth of the southern view that a new Union had been created . ''

		It is expressly stated that the book is not to be merely a chapter of Southern history , but is to adopt and maintain a national outlook .

		Thus matters of diplomacy , of transcontinental railroad building , of national finance , as well as matters of national poli - tics , all have their place .

		Yet after all has been said , one can not lay the volume down without the feeling that the centre of interest historically as well as dramatically lies in the processes by which the
Southern States of the Union	ORGANIZATION	passed from the years of warfare to that condition of things which , for good or ill , has been and has thus far remained , '' the Solid South . ''

		It is , however , in the highest degree desirable and important that we should ever be reminded that even when apparently the isolation was most complete , and certainly the feeling of sec - tionalism was most intense , this history was but a part of a larger history : something which will be more and more realized both in thp South and in the North .

		The titles of the next three volumes , -- '' National Development , '' '' National Problems , '' and '' America the World Power , '' -- suggest at first sight a topical treatment .

		As a matter of fact each book treats of much the same topics , within the limits of a decade , more or less ; and together they cover the events of the last generation , from
1877	DATE	to
1907	DATE	.

		Thus the first of these three , written by Professor
E. E. Sparks	PERSON	, brings the narrative down to the election of
Cleveland	LOCATION	in
1884	DATE	; in the second .

		Professor
Davis R. Dewey	PERSON	continues it to the campaign of
1896	DATE	; while the story of the last ten years , including especially the account of the Spanish - American `` War , is left to Professor
John H. Latan	PERSON	^ .

		Through all the volumes run many threads that are the same : the course of party conflict , the growth of foreign policy , the various phases of the economic develop - ment of the
Nation	ORGANIZATION	.

		Professor
Sparks	PERSON	shows the fundamental changes that marked the close of the epoch of Reconstruction : it is significant that political history as such is not taken up before the sixth chapter of his book and then commands a relatively limited space .

		It is the recital of economic facts , and the statement of nascent economic problems , that gives the book its distinc - tion .

		Of course many of these economic facts and problems were , or soon became , intimately connected with politics , and thus the tariff , the currency , the expansion of inland commerce , and kindred subjects have been made the basis of partisan appeals to voters .

		But Professor
Sparks	PERSON	begins with an account of the Exposition of
1876	DATE	, with its expres - sion of the new spirit of the American people , -- the spirit of business enterprise now entering into a larger stage of activity , and prepared to do larger things than the men of the earlier
Union	ORGANIZATION	could have dreamed of .

		Careful study is thus devoted to the population of the country as it stood when the
last quarter	DATE	of the nineteenth century began , and later a chapter is given to the Immigration problem and one to the question of Chinese exclusion .

		There is a succinct account of the progress of invention and discovery , especially in the fields of electrical and mechani - cal engineering .

		Another chapter tells of the earlier phases of railroad development that marked the period under review , pointing out the favor with which the
Government	ORGANIZATION	, in the Act of
1866	DATE	, had viewed the unification of railroad systems in trunk lines , as con - trasted with the later hostility to consolidations .

		The wider change of sentiment towards the roads which expressed itself in the
Granger	PERSON	movement is dis - cussed , with helpful reference to the reports of early congressional committees upon the subject .

		In this way the reader is led up to the
Interstate Commerce	ORGANIZATION	Act of
1887	DATE	, which is treated at length in the suc - ceeding volume .

		Quite as valuable is the chapter upon industrial problems , where the agitation for a shorter working day , the extension into too familiar use of the ancient methods of the '' strike '' and the '' boycott , '' the growth of organization as expressed in the '' Knights of Labor , '' the weakness of militia in the face of labor difficulties , and the power of the Courts , are shown to have very soon called attention to the desirability of peace between labor and capital , and to have moved
Congress	ORGANIZATION	to the initial step of creating , in
1884	DATE	, a bureau of labor statistics .

		In the political part of the volume , the central theme is found in the factional fights of parties , and the concurrent struggles in the direction of civil ser - vice reform .

		The forces which led to the defeat of Blaine are clearly analyzed .

		The prominence of the West in
National	ORGANIZATION	affairs which is revealed so clearly by the author was , of course , no new pheno - menon , but Professor
Sparks	PERSON	brings out the social and economic conditions which regmphasized the influence of the West ; and thus the Mormons , the Indian tribes , and the interests of the cowboys and ranchmen , miners and railroad kings , appear with that effect of romance which we have since attri - buted to the '' West . ''

		Only one important topic seems to have been neglected , or left to another place -- the cultural development of the country .


1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 311 The frontispiece to the volume is a portrait of
James Russell Lowell	PERSON	; but as the name of that distin - guished diplomat and man of letters does not appear in Professor
Sparks	PERSON	's book , the picture would seem to be an overflow from the last volume of the text .

		If in the volumes thus far discussed the approach of the present has made itself felt , this becomes far stronger as one turns to the works of Professor
Dewey	PERSON	and Professor Latan ^ .

		In the former of these , the personality of President
Cleveland	LOCATION	takes the first place : the book covers his two terms of office , with the intervening administration of Presi - dent
Harrison	PERSON	.

		Professor
Dewey	PERSON	comments on the difficulties of the treatment of recent history : the unavailability of private papers , the overwhelming mass of detail not yet sifted and criticized , and the troubling question of proper perspective .

		He applies these to such definite problems as `` the relations of
Cleveland	LOCATION	to the ' reactionary spoilsmen ' of his first administration , the origin of the tariff message of
1887	DATE	, the failure of Sherman to secure the presiden - tial nomination in
1888	DATE	, the relations of
Harrison	PERSON	and
Blaine	PERSON	and the sudden resignation of the latter , and the swerving in our foreign policy marked by the Venezuelan message , '' -- problems which , he says , '' have still to be definitely interpreted by the historian . ''

		But notwithstanding these admitted limitations as to material and depth of treatment .

		Professor
Dewey	PERSON	has given a political history of these twelve years that is admirable in every respect .

		It is a period that demands able handling , for the currents and counter-currents of American politics are peculiarly confused and especially important .

		Not only were the executive and one or the other branch of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	during much of this time of different political faith , but within the parties there was positive disagreement .

		But while the history of parties and party leaders , and the narrative of our diplomatic affairs , are so satisfactorily carried through these years , the strik - ing characteristic of the volume -LRB- as the other writings of the author would lead one to expect -RRB- is the masterly discussion of economic questions .

		These are the real '' National Problems '' suggested in the title of the book , -- the varying fortunes of the protective tariff , the development of organized labor , the growth of trusts , the further attempts to regulate railroads , and especially the evolution of the monetary system of the country and the activity of the friends of the free and unlimited coinage of silver .

		The last topic , both in its special form and in its general relation to public finance , is treated extensively in four chapters scattered through the work , the last of which , that upon the campaign of
1896	DATE	, brings the book to a close with no little dramatic effect .

		The defeat of Mr.
Bryan	PERSON	is attri - buted to the fear felt towar * his policies by the business interests of the country , rather than to `` deep-seated popular adherence to the principles of the Republican party . ''

		There is also a sharp word of criticism for the Democrats , and '' the bickerings and dissensions which humiliated the Democratic administration . ''

		President
Cleveland	LOCATION	, concludes Professor
Dewey	PERSON	, '' was sacrificed by his party ; but even his enemies respected his consistency and firmness , and in later years have hastened to pay tribute which was denied when he retired from office . ''

		It is a coincidence not without interest that the first volume of Professor
Hart	PERSON	's series that treated the narrative of English-speaking
America	LOCATION	was written by a student of history from the oldest of the colonies , -- President
Lyon G. Tyler	PERSON	of
William	LOCATION	and
Mary College	ORGANIZATION	in
Virginia	LOCATION	, while the last narra - tive volume is the work of a younger scholar of the same
State	ORGANIZATION	, -- Professor
John H. Latand	PERSON	of Wash - ington and Lee .

		The work of the former dealt with English settlements before
1660	DATE	, but chiefly with the development of
Virginia	LOCATION	; in the latter 's volume the
National	ORGANIZATION	spirit of the new era is pre - dominant .

		In fact , one might almost substitute the word international , for the larger part of Professor Latan ^ 's book is concerned with the events that have removed the
United States	LOCATION	from the old-time isola - tion into the field of world-politics .

		The social and economic problems of
National	ORGANIZATION	importance , made so prominent in the volumes just preceding , are here disappointingly compressed into two chapters , where one finds , for example , but the briefest mention of the federal Railroad Rate law of
1906	DATE	.

		Two chapters are devoted to the two last Presidential elections .

		The remainder of the book is easily divisible into two halves .

		The first carries the story of the Spanish-American War from the intervention in
Cuba	LOCATION	through the peace negotiations of 1898-1899 and the Philippine Insurrection .

		Here one finds a careful narrative without any spirit of jingoism ; and if the style be here and there some - what journalistic , that is perhaps unavoidable in writ - ing of events so fresh in the public mind and thus far handled so exclusively in that manner .

		The second division to which we have referred lies within Professor Latan ^ 's chosen metier , in which his earlier writings have won him distinction .

		This is the his - tory of diplomacy , and the central theme of this volume is the `` sphere of international relations in which
America	LOCATION	is undoubtedly destined to play a larger part . ''

		This is elaborated in interesting and valuable chapters upon the Spanish-American Peace negotiations ,
American Diplomacy	ORGANIZATION	in the Orient , the Alaskan Boundary , the
Panama Canal	LOCATION	, our relations to
Cuba	LOCATION	and the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	, and , finally , the very vital topics of international arbitration and the forcible collection of debts due from one
State	ORGANIZATION	to another .

		In his development of diplomatic history , the author treats not merely the technique of foreign affairs but the wider economic and constitutional effects of diplomatic action .

		In a tone thoroughly controlled and impartial , he reviews
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	's decisions in the Insular cases , concluding that commercial and political interests decided the con - 312 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, stitutional position of our new possessions before
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	took up the cases , and that the Court 's decisions , '' confusing and unsatisfactory as they were from the standpoint of constitutional law , '' simply recognized un fait accompli .

		In the case of the
Panama Canal	ORGANIZATION	and the secession of
Panama	LOCATION	from
Colombia	LOCATION	, the author indulges in a couple of paragraphs of very keen and clear criticism of the President 's public ethics , remarking that full accept - ance of the President 's public arguments '' involved the recognition of the President as the agent of col - lective civilization , clothed with the power of regu - lating the international right of eminent domain . ''

		The chapters • on international arbitration , the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	, and the collection of public debts by foreign nations are closely inter-connected : in - deed the author considers that the last topic constitutes the most recent phase of the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	.

		He gives an excellent summary of the developments in
Venezuela	LOCATION	and
Santo Domingo	LOCATION	, clos - ing with a discussion of the unsatisfactory status in which the question has been left by the third Inter - national Conference of American States held at
Rio Janeiro	LOCATION	in
July , 1906	DATE	, and by the Second Peace Con - ference at the
Hague	LOCATION	, in
1907	DATE	.

		In the final volume of the series .

		Professor
Hart	PERSON	, as editor of the texts , considers American ideals from the standpoint of their historical development .

		The sixteenth volume , also contributed by him , was a discussion of the connected topics of slavery and abolition .

		This new volume is a review of American life in general .

		The author lays stress upon the his - torical or evolutionary treatment which differentiates his work from Bryce 's ''
American Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Professor
Hart	PERSON	wishes to prove that `` we are own brothers to our great-grandfathers . ''

		He thus recap - itulates American history along the great lines of geographic environment , race and social conditions , American government , and social and economic activities , concluding with a prospect of the future of American democracy .

		The book is a collection of summaries and generalizations , some of which seem strong and clear , others , such as the discussion of cul - tural development , much less satisfactory .

		Certain fundamental assumptions would be expected : sov - ereignty rested in the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	rather than in the
States	LOCATION	; the Puritans have furnished '' the little leaven that leavens the whole lump . ''

		But in general the outlook is one distinctly broad and sympathetic .

		Professor
Hart	PERSON	recognizes the incon - sistency with the theoretical democracy of Lincoln of the settlement , after the Spanish-American War , of the Philippine question ; but this inconsistency does not discourage his hope for the future .

		The failures of Democracy include the lack of discrimina - tion between high things and low , the toleration by Americans of poor city government , the contempt of expert opinion , intense party feeling , the love for excitement and the sensational press , the exist - ence of scandalous corruption , and the possibility of class rivalry .

		These defects are strongly put : what is lacking is the deeper philosophical analysis of what Democracy really is , -- or rather , what it is to be in the future .

		Well worthy of approbation is the '' Analytic Index '' to the series , prepared by Mr.
D. M. Matteson	PERSON	of the
Harvard University Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		In a work of this sort minor inaccuracies will occur , such as the failure to distinguish between the two persons named
Daniel Dulany	PERSON	.

		These are trifles , however , in view of the immense serviceableness of the Index to the twenty-six volumes , with general topical references also carefully worked out .

		It is asking too much , perhaps , and aiming at something too difficult of accomplishment , to expect such an Index to include more than it does of the biblio - graphical matter ; to reach this in unified form one has Larned 's Bibliography and similar works .

		As a word of conclusion , in leaving this note - worthy addition to the literature of American history , we may express an opinion as to its chief usefulness .

		As a work of reference it should be in every library .

		It will be of especial value to teachers .

		To the general reader single volumes will appeal , and thus popularize a scientific treatment of history .

		It is , however , far too extensive to be a '' popular '' history .

		On the other hand , only some of its volumes will serve the purposes of the specialist .

		With its many excellences , it is to be questioned whether the series as a whole has demonstrated the impossibility or the uselessness of the attempt to attain unity or uniformity in the work of a single master hand .

		`` An American Student in
France	LOCATION	, '' admirably translated , as was the earlier work , by the accomplished author , and generously illustrated , presents the author 's conception of the way things French impress an inquiring , observant , and serious-minded American student of about twenty-one years of age .

		The student is a compos - ite type , and , naturally , somewhat idealized ; hence not thoroughly real and '' convincing '' to the reader .

		But that does not prevent one 's deriving a good deal of entertainment and instruction from the Abba 's frank and comrade-like talks on various subjects of historic , political , religious , and literary interest , whosoever may serve as ostensible mouth-piece from page to page .

		Certain well-known cities , -- as
Paris	LOCATION	,
Versailles	LOCATION	,
Rouen	LOCATION	, -- are visited by the imaginary American youth , and % ther regions less familiar , -- as
Quercy	ORGANIZATION	,
Tarn	ORGANIZATION	, and
Auvergne	LOCATION	, '' where one can see , '' the author says , `` along with charming and curious landscapes , the most striking examples of our ancient manners . ''

		He apologizes for the con -
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 313 siderable space accorded to current politico-religious discussions , and notably to the separation of
Church and State	ORGANIZATION	, questions which he regards as among the most important that have arisen in
France	LOCATION	for a cen - tury .

		His views on the separation referred to may be gathered from the imaginary discussions of the subject in his book .

		He is broad-minded and looks at the matter from more than one point of view , but what he has put into the mouth of an imaginary French bishop is presumably the expression of his own opinion , '' More important still than this material readjustment , '' says the bishop toward the end of a long harangue , '' appears to us the moral renovation which the separation regime will impose on the clergy and the faithful .

		Henceforth the clergy , being in contact with the realities of existence and at the same time obliged to see , consult with , interest their people , and render account to them , will acquire a truer idea of modern life and its exi - gencies ; it will become more indulgent , while its qualities of initiative and intelligence will be devel - oped . ''

		In comparing things American with what is encountered on French soU , the
Abb	ORGANIZATION	^ , or the Abba 's '' student , '' is not invariably trustworthy .

		For example , after referring to
Jeanne d'Arc	PERSON	, '' the heroine who was burnt alive for witchcraft in
1431	DATE	, '' the American visitor says : '' I blush to think that at home , in
New England	LOCATION	, as late as the year
1692	DATE	, the heads of twenty-eight victims were cut off , eight in one day , under this same insane pretext . ''

		As a matter of historic fact , in
1692	DATE	, at the height of the Salem witchcraft frenzy , nineteen persons were hanged -LRB- not beheaded -RRB- on Gallows Hill , and one old man ,
Giles Corey	PERSON	, was pressed to death for refus - ing to plead .

		Modern progress ^ ^ '' Chapters in Rural Progress '' of the rural -LRB-
University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr. community .


Kenyon L. Butterfield	ORGANIZATION	presents a col - lection of addresses and magazine articles grouped imder a few general headings but all bearing on the same topic .

		The author is President of the
Massa	PERSON	- chusetts
Agricultural College	ORGANIZATION	, and has written and spoken much on a subject that he evidently has close at heart .

		He disarms criticism somewhat by calling attention to the fact that his book has the limitations of collected papers ; yet one questions if it would not have been more effective if the materials had been worked over and welded together more compactly .

		However , many of the chapters are admirably suited to be read before farmer 's institutes , grange meet - ings , and agricultural schools -- such audiences as first heard them from the author .

		The central thought running through all is the vital importance of the personal progress and development of the American farmer , if he is to hold his own in this swiftly moving century .

		This advancement must be not merely technical but cultural , -- not superficial but real , based on a wide and deep knowledge of the problems of the farm and the farmer . ''

		The farm problem consists in maintaining upon our farms a class of people who have succeeded in procuring for themselves the highest possible class status , not only in the industrial but in the political and social order , -- a relative status , moreover , that is measured by the demands of American ideals . ''

		The author then shows how the '' old farmer , '' with his sterling quali - ties , who furnished the backbone to earlier Amer - ican life , has merged into the '' new farmer , '' with advanced ideas and the energy of progress , and how both are in marked contrast to the '' moss-back . ''

		The section on '' Agencies of Progress '' gives his - torical sketches of the Farmers ' Institutes , the Grange , and the more recent ''
Hesperia Movement	ORGANIZATION	, '' describing also the valuable work these agencies are accomplishing to-day ; it treats of the rural school and the community , opportunities for farm women , the country church and progress , sketches what edu - cation may mean to the farmer , and gives a summary of recent progress .

		Mr.
Butterfield	PERSON	emphasizes the high service of educated women on the farm , the beneficial influence they may have on the community as well as on their homes , becoming a power in their generation and those to follow . ''

		An Untilled Field in American Education '' urges the study of agricultural economics and of rural sociology , not only in agricultural colleges but also in normal schools , theological seminaries , and universities , from which go the teachers and clergymen and editors who may wield the greatest power in their communities .

		The final chapter is entitled ''
Feder	PERSON	- ation for Rural Progress , '' and here the author lays stress on the subject as it is to be developed outside of the schools , his idea being that all the social agencies -- granges , institutes , all societies bearing on rural subjects of any sort , '' country teachers , preachers , editors , doctors , and business men , and , more than all , intelligent and progressive farmers '' -- should so federate in a '' League for Social Progress '' -LRB- of which he gives examples in leagues now exist - ing -RRB- that their work shall not be duplicated but ex - tended , that every phase of the rural problem shall be met by an adequate solution , that the specialist and the practical man shall come together , and that the cooperation of individuals shall merge into the cooperation of interests .

		We regret to note a few such solecisms as '' grand business proposition '' and '' enthuse , '' but in general the book is written in a simple and direct fashion that suits the subject .

		It should be in the hands of all who are in any way interested in rural progress , from the farmer to the school trustee .

Intel	ORGANIZATION	- 314 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, lectual or spiritual aspect of the subject -- although it is true that he intends '' to indicate everywhere a triune ideal of normal well-being and happiness . ''

		His philosophy of right living -- of training sym - metrically body and mind and soul -- he ventures to call a '' triunistic or unitrinian philosophy , '' the word '' trinitarian '' being preempted for another and a universally recognized purpose .

		At the outset the author does well to remind the reader that '' the culture of personality ... is a very complex and subtle process .

		It is not accomplished by the ac - quiring of knowledge and the adoption of morality alone , but by every moment 's life of the body , -- every deed , every word , every gesture , -- by the deliberate training of exercise and regimen , by the long course of habitual occupation , and by every brief act of each irrevocable instant .

		We not only transform our outward bodily persons by what we are , making them simulacra of our inmost selves , but in sober truth our most essential selves are in their turn reflexly transformed by the reacting influence of our physical habits and doing ^ . ''

		This will sug - gest to many , as it did to the author , the stanza from '' Rabbi
Ben Ezra	PERSON	'' ending , '' nor soul helps flesh more , now , than flesh helps soul ! ''

		And it is not surprising to find many pages of the book devoted to such themes as the form and function of the human foot , the art of walking correctly and of breath - ing properly , dancing as a fine art , the rhythm of grace , the sorcery of the hand , the importance of manners , and the notorious disregard of much that is hygienic and aesthetic in our dress .

		It is the Greek beauty of life that we are to realize anew , by proper attention to rhythmic grace of motion , to harmonious training of all parts of the body , and to the acquisition of that tunefulness of the whole being to which our latter-day devotion to narrower and narrower specialties is so hostile .

		Of athletics as practised in this day and generation Mr.
Carman	PERSON	has a poor opinion : he regrets that '' college athletics , which might have so great an influence for nobility and beauty in forming American manhood , are actually always too near exhibitionary gladiatorial professionalism , and tend to vulgarize and brutalize their students . ''

		The lesson of the book , it is need - less to add , is taught with a richness and poetic charm of style that make each successive chapter a new delight .

		Philosophy has been defined as poetry addressed to the understanding , just as poetry has been called philosophy addressed to the emotions .

		Mr.
Carman	PERSON	's book is both philosophy and poetry , and its appeal is twofold . ''

		Who 's Who in
America	LOCATION	'' has now Who 1st ' * ?

		reached its fifth biennial issue , and is thicker and more useful than ever .

		As compared with the first issue , the present one has three times the number of pages and nearly twice the number of biographies .

		It now gives us , in its twenty-four hundred closely printed pages , the essential facts about more than sixteen thousand living Americans .

		An important feature , now for the first time incorporated in the work , is a geo - graphical index , which brings together all the names of those living in any given city , state , or foreign country .

		It shows , for example , that about eight hundred Chicagoans are distinguished enough for inclusion in the work .

		The last entry in this index is as follows : ''
Wales	LOCATION	,
Craig y Nos Castle	PERSON	,
Patti	PERSON	,
Adelina	LOCATION	, prima donna . ''

		The editor , Mr.
Albert Nelson Marquis	PERSON	, contributes a preface which is both instructive and entertaining .

		It is the former be - cause it gives some valuable statistical gleanings from the work , and it is the latter because it reflects some of the humorously diversified opinions of the editor 's multitudinous correspondents .

		Perhaps the most amusing of these opinions is that of the clergy - man who calls it '' a vicious book , because it seeks to establish a man 's worth in the world by the position he occupies . ''

		The editor does not claim too much when he says , with pardonable pride , that the work `` has achieved a world-wide recognition as something fixed and requisite . ''

		Coming to us at the same time as its American prototype , we welcome the new vol - ume of '' Wer Ist 's ? ''

		This is the third issue of the work , which is described as '' voUkommen neu bearbeitet und wesentlich erweitert . ''

		volume has recently been pro- duced .

		This , however , has not yet come to our hand .

Patrick Augustine Sheehan	PERSON	, reflections of
Canon of Cloyne	ORGANIZATION	, poet , essayist , and an
Irish Canon	ORGANIZATION	, novelist , has issued a companion volume to '' Under the Cedars and the Stars , '' and has given it the unassuming title , '' Parerga '' -LRB- Long - mans -RRB- .

		Grouped under the four seasons , beginning with
Autumn	ORGANIZATION	, this collection of obiter dicta is devoted largely , and very acceptably , to brief comments on books and writers and the high themes of life , with just enough passing reference to the changing year to render the four division-headings not too meaningless .

		Like many idealists who lead an existence insufficiently rich in mundane interests and engrossments -- domestic , social , civic , and commercial -- this author has apparently failed to bring the ideal and the real into any tolerable modus vivendi .

		While he well says that `` idealism ... is the fulcrum , the only fulcrum , with which an Archimedean spirit can move , and lift , the human race , '' he is constrained to believe that '' poets and philosophers and dreamers must keep steadily at their task , ' weaving by
night	TIME	and day the magic web , ' and never turning to watch in the bald and bare realities of life the replica of the fairy images wrought by the spell of imagination in the mirror of their own fancies . ''

		He does not hesitate to assert that `` the world has become hopelessly and irredeemably vulgar , '' that `` the spirit of evil is everywhere , '' and that '' every poet who turns away from his magic mirror and stares boldly at the
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 315 realities of human existence becomes a confirmed pessimist . ''

		These are strong statements .

		But , surely , while there are in the world books like '' Parerga '' and writers like the
Canon of Cloyne	ORGANIZATION	, that world is not quite '' hopelessly and irredeemably vulgar . ''

		Let us wish for him that some day he may encounter some soul-stirring -LRB- perhaps even some heart-breaking -RRB- experience of reality to dissi - pate these vapors .

		An attractive feature of the volume is its occasional appreciative comment on Shakespeare ; but even in the midst of this the author pulls himseK up to ask , `` What .

		is it that repels me in Shakespeare ? ''

		and he continues : '' I admit all his intellectual vastness and greatness .

		He stands alone ; or Dante alone may stand unabashed by his side .

		Yet I can not read him with pleasure , but always as a study .

		And I can not read him for profit , even though he has my fullest meed of admir - ation . ''

		One '' valid reason '' for this he thinks to be that
Shakespeare	PERSON	's plays '' were written for tjie stage , not for the closet ; for the glare of footlights , not for the student 's lamp . ''

		Such a mixture of critical appreciation and temperamental aversion has rarely been brought to the study of Shakespeare as manifests itself , again and again , in
Canon Sheehan	ORGANIZATION	's pages .

		For this and other reasons the book is far from being commonplace or dull .

		Mr.
John R. Spears	PERSON	, who has already Z ` u ^ TnZv ^ .

		given to the public a history of the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	in five volumes and an abridg - ment of it in one volume , now presents a third work on the same subject in a single volume -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		The new book is more than an abridgment of the larger work or an amplification of the smaller one , for it is based in part upon a new reading of the sources .

		The author says in his preface that he '' has been animated by a desire to tell , in one convenient vol - ume that might be sold at a moderate price , the whole story of our navy , -- to describe all the import - ant battles , and to show how the nation has been affected at certain times by the work of its naval ships and at other times by the want of such a force . ''

		He has fairly succeeded in accomplishing his object as set forth in these words ; he has written a popular history of our navy , convenient in size , plain and straightforward in style , and generally accurate as to facts .

		At times his judgment is immoderate , -- as , for instance , when he says that
Lawrence	PERSON	was '' first on the list of foolhardy '' -LRB- p. 102 -RRB- ; that
New England	LOCATION	in
June , 1812	DATE	, was full of traitors -LRB- p. 86 -RRB- ; and that the battle between the '' Constitution '' and the '' Guerrifere '' saved the navy and the nation -LRB- p. 87 -RRB- .

		Some fault might also be foimd with the author 's arrangement of his materials .

		There seems to be no good reason why a chapter on the origin of the War of
1812	DATE	should precede one on the war with
Tripoli	LOCATION	, 1801-1805 ; or why the engagement between the '' President '' and `` Little Belt , ''
1811	DATE	, should come after the principal fights of the year
1812	DATE	.

		But these are minor defects in a generally creditable and useful book .

		A re-teiiina of ^ ^ selecting
Juan Ponce	PERSON	de Leon as the romance of the Subject of One of his volumes in Concede Leon , ^ j ^ g series of `` Heroes of American History '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , Mr.
Frederick A. Ober	PERSON	assumed the task of writing a biography with very slender materials at command , and this has necessitated the resort to padding , though the book be still a small one .

		The author 's familiarity with the
West Indies	LOCATION	has come to his assistance , and he has eked out the few well-known incidents of
Juan Ponce	PERSON	's career by a more detailed account of that sturdy conquistador 's exploitation of
the Island of Porto Rico	LOCATION	.

		He further - more finds occasion to correct some widespread but erroneous popular impressions regarding
Juan Ponce	PERSON	de Leon .

		He was not an old man to whom the
Fountain of Perpetual Youth	ORGANIZATION	was an especial desid - eratum when he set out in search of the
Island of Bimini	LOCATION	, being then but fifty-three years of age ; nor was the
Fountain of Youth	ORGANIZATION	the chief object of his search .

		Like all the adventurers of his time , he was seeking gold , and slaves to work the mines .

		Mr.
Ober	PERSON	clearly shows , also , that the year which saw
Juan Ponce	PERSON	on the shores of
Florida	LOCATION	was not
1512	DATE	, as is usually stated , but the one following .

		The book is an entertaining one , and a contribution , in its way , to historical literature .

Fernand Nicolay	PERSON	's `` Napoleon at the Boulogne Camp '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- with the expectation of finding a solution of the problems involved .

		They will discover , instead , the results of the zealous but rambling researches of a local antiquary , whose original interest in the matter sprang from the family ownership of the exact spot on the Plateau d'Ordre where stood the pavilions of
Napoleon	PERSON	and of his admiral ,
Bruix	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Nicolay	PERSON	tells diverting tales of almost every phase of the camp life at
Boulogne	LOCATION	.

		He describes the camp in detail , the flotilla , the training of the soldiers , and the incidents that enlivened the long months of waiting , including even the performances of the
Paris	LOCATION	Vaudeville company and the choral songs of the soldiers .

		In the final chapter he attempts to review the evidence in regard to the project for crossing the Channel , as late as
August , 1805	DATE	.

		For a task of this sort the author seems unfitted , for he gives more credence to the random and inexact recollections of Constant than to the results of the researches of Desbribre , based upon official papers preserved in the Archives of War and
Marine	ORGANIZATION	.

		• To write a life of Queen Victoria that VumTuTeent '' ^ ^ ^ ^ ll not take the form of a glowing eulogy seems to be an impossible , as it may also be an undesirable , achievement .

		Mr.
Frank Hird	PERSON	, in his '' Victoria the Woman '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , has certainly not produced a coldly impartial or unsympathetic biography .

		He emphat - ically calls her `` the greatest of the English queens '' and , what is more , `` the simplest , the kindest , the 816 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, purest , the most single-minded of women . ''

		The purpose of the book , as he explains in the preface , is `` to place before my readers in
America	LOCATION	, where the Queen was reverenced and so deeply admired , some impression of the influences that affected her early environment , some suggestion of the circum - stances that affected her later years .

		I have endeavored to show the Queen as a daughter , a wife , a woman , a mother , a friend , and a sovereign , and wherever it has been possible I have made use of the
Queen	ORGANIZATION	's own words , as it is in her letters and her diaries that her character , in all its charm of simplicity and naturalness , its warm affection , its impartiality of opinion , its instinctive understanding , its ever-ready sympathy , and true womanliness , fully reveals itself .

		Some of the letters have never before been published . ''

		In four hundred clearly printed pages , with a sufficiency of good illustrations , the growth of the Queen 's character is traced , with a considerable introduction of current history and politics .

		Nothing very new or very original was to be expected in such a study of so well-known a per - sonage ; but a serviceable and readable book has been produced , and for those who do not and can not own the voluminous and expensive '' Letters '' this volume , with its copious extracts from those letters and from the diaries , should serve as a welcome substitute .

THOMAS McKEAN	PERSON	THE `` master influence '' -- love , still love that makes the world go round -- is in evidence almost from the outset of the nar - rative , although not until the final page is the account of the fickle god closed and fairly balanced .

		The novelist sketches in succes - sion numerous variant phases of the grand passion -- lawless love , that ends in death ; the bitterness of vain longing ; reckless impulse with its tragical culmination -- these and kindred aspects of the main theme are brought into strong relief as the plot of the story is disclosed and developed .


Helen Mainwaring	PERSON	, the heroine , is an interesting as well as an at - tractive figure .

		A young woman of birth , breeding and wealth , it is her belief that she can live without love .

		Author of '' The Theory of Advertising , '' etc. .

		During the past decade the realization has grown up that since advertising seeks to influence the human mind , and phychology is the study of the human mind , therefore , the more the business man knows about psychology the better he will know how to advertise .

		Professor Scott 's book is the common meeting ground of the psychologist and the advertiser .

		The prevailing note of the book is its usefulness , for it is based on practical laboratory tests of the psychological effects of advertisements .

		Important principles are laid down and the application explained clearly and convincingly .

		Advertisers who say that the way to learn to advertise is -- to advertise , will find here just the book they need ; it is the boiled-down result of genuine experience interpreted accurately .

		Ambulator nascitur ^ nonjit .

		That the poet is born and not made , no one would dispute ; ' that the walker , like the poet , is born and not made , might not be so generally admitted , but was the belief of at least one authority on walk - ing ,
Thoreau	LOCATION	.

		A gift for poetry and a gift for walking are perhaps not found so often together as separate ; yet there are many instances of their happy union in one and the same person .

		Bards and minstrels we think of as making their way on foot from place to place , and even from country to country .

		Homer must have been a tremendous walker -- so little stationary that no fewer than seven cities claimed him as son .


Goldsmith	PERSON	, strolling over
Europe	LOCATION	and making music as he went , is a familiar example .

		Wordsworth composed his poems as he walked , elaborating long passages of verse before putting pen to paper .

		Walking for the love of walking , and for the enjoyment of nature by the way , seems to be a comparatively modern form of recreation .

		When
Wordsworth	PERSON	, in his third long vacation at
Cambridge	LOCATION	, in the
summer of 1790	DATE	, took staff in hand and , with a friend , made the tour of
Switzerland	LOCATION	on foot , he spoke of this pedestrian enterprise as an '' unprecedented course , '' and as indicative of `` a hardy slight of college studies and their set rewards . ''

		One of the poet 's biographers inclines to think that Words - worth and his companion were indeed the first students to indulge in this now so common relaxation from academic toil .

		Until about a century ago it seems rarely to have occurred to anyone that mountains and woods and rocky coasts are objects to be ad - mired , and to be visited even at much cost of bodily ease and comfort .

		One of the characters in '' Sir
Charles Grandison	PERSON	'' feels nothing but horror for the Alpine scenery of
Savoy	ORGANIZATION	, as viewed from the
Mont Cenis	ORGANIZATION	pass .

		He contrasts the region , '' equally noted for its poverty and rocky mountains , '' with the smiling fields of
France	LOCATION	, and declares that his spirits '' were great sufferers by the change . ''

		But for Sir
Charles	PERSON	's kindness and attention to his comfort , he feels that he never coidd have faced the terrible pass - age to
Italy	LOCATION	.

		Bishop
Berkeley	LOCATION	, a man of taste and sensibility , passing over this same mountain 334 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, road to
Italy	LOCATION	in
1714	DATE	, was '' put out of humour by the most horrible precipices , '' and advised a friend to choose the comparatively safe and pleasant route by sea .

		Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	-LRB- to quote one more eighteenth-century authority -RRB- was so little inspired by the scenery of the Scotch highlands that he could declare in aU serious - ness : '' It will readily occur that this imiformity ' of barrenness can afford very little amusement to the traveller ; that it is easy to sit at home and conceive rocks , heaths , and waterfalls , and that these journeys are useless labours , which neither impregnate the imagination nor inform the understanding . ''

		Perhaps if
Johnson	PERSON	had been a walker , instead of being obliged to sub - mit his unwieldly bulk to the jolts and jars of vehicular transport , he might have brought home a kinder remembrance of that '' uniformity of barrenness . ''

		As it was , he could just as well , so far as his susceptibility to scenic charm was concerned , have sat at his ease in the parlor of the '' Mitre '' and conceived rocks , heaths , and waterfalls , in any number and variety .

		For him , certainly , there was no pleasure in the pathless woods , no rapture on the lonely shore .

		It is refreshing to turn from the incorrigibly urban and sedentary
Johnson	PERSON	to that pedestrian enthusiast and enamoured mountain-climber ,
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	-- who , curiously enough , was one of
Johnson	ORGANIZATION	's warmest admirers .


Stephen	PERSON	's ascription of a moral quality to the innate love of walking is well known : a passion for pedes - trianism could not , to his thinking , consist with vicious habits .

		And however matter-of-fact and drily prosaic he may have chosen to imagine himself in his editorial chair or in the bookish seclusion of his study , there was something in the charm of natural scenery to make him break forth in song , at least in his earlier life .

		In that delightful and too-little-read early book of his , entitled '' The Playground of
Europe	LOCATION	, '' are to be found no fewer than thirty-eight quota - tions or adaptations from the poets , an average of one to every nine pages , which , for a writer by no means sentimental or romantic , is doing pretty well .

		He gives the reader the feeling of walking with him up steep mountain paths , across glaciers , over jagged rocks , along fearfid precipices , and down snowy slopes ; and with him the reader finds himself poetically inspired -- to the point of more or less apt quotation , at any rate .

		For poetic charm , just relieved -LRB- so to speak -RRB- by the subtlest suggestion of dry humor , what could be better than
Stephen	PERSON	's description of a sunset that he viewed from
Mont Blanc	PERSON	, after an all-day climb from
Chamouni	PERSON	for the purpose of witnessing , if weather conditions should be favorable , a spectacle of extraordinary grandeur that not more than half a dozen human beings had seen before him ?

		Let us transcribe a few sentences . ''

		Peak by peak the high snowfields caught the rosy glow and shone like sigfnal-fires across the dim breadths of delicate twilight .

		Like Xerxes we looked over the countless host sinking to rest , but with the rather difPer - ent reflection , that a hundred years hence they would probably be doing much the same thing , whilst we should long have ceased to take any interest in the performance ... We were between the day and the
night	TIME	.

		The western heavens were of the most brilliant blue with spaces of transparent green , whilst a few scattering cloudlets glowed as if with internal fire .

		To the east the night rushed up furiously , and it was diffi - cult to imagine that the dark purple sky was really cloudless and not blackened by the rising of some por - tentous storm .

		That it was , in fact , cloudless , appeared from the unbroken disc of the full moon , which , if I may venture to say so , had a kind of silly expression , as though it were a bad imitation of the sun , totally unable to keep the darkness in order . '' '

		With how sad steps , O moon , thou climb ` st the sky , How silently and with how wan a face ! ' ''

		Stephen walked with senses alert for every impression from without , but at the same time with no vacancy of mind within . ''

		You must walk like a camel , '' says
Thoreau	PERSON	, '' which is said to be the only beast which ruminates when walking . ''

		And yet the rumination must not be too engrossing . ''

		I am alarmed , '' confesses the same nature-lover and sturdy pedestrian , '' when it happens that I have walked a mile into the woods bodily , without getting there in spirit . ''

		Rather should one have the soul tuned in harmony with that of the jocund traveller who rises before the mind 's eye in the quaint old '' When he came to a grene wode .

		In a merry momynge , There he herde the notes small Of byrdes merry syngynge . ''

		What coidd better picture the escape from the asphyxia of towns and streets , and from the mustiness of libraries and studies ?

		Thoreau , who held that the noble art of walking comes only by the grace of God , said that he had met with but two persons who imderstood this art , who had a genius , so to speak , for sauntering ; and he took pleasure in going back to the derivation of '' saunter '' -LRB- from sainte terre -RRB- ^ a wood whose history is written on its face .

		He liked to think of every real walk as a sort of crusade .

		His crusades , how - ever , were preferably to the West , not toward the East -- probably because
Boston	LOCATION	and other cities of men lay not far distant in the latter direction , and the hermit of
Walden	PERSON	sought the uninhabited wilds . ''

		My spirits infallibly rise
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 335 in proportion to the outward dreariness , '' he tells us ; and further , with the true walker 's impulse toward poetry : '' I do not know of any poetry to quote which adequately expresses this yearning for the Wild .

		Approached from this side , the best poetry is tame .

		I do not know where to find in any literature , ancient or modern , any account which contents me of that Nature with which even I am acquainted .

		You will perceive that I demand something which no Augustan nor Elizabethan age , which no culture ^ in short , can give .

		Mythology comes nearer to it than anything . ''

		The swift bicycle did much to discredit plod - ding pedestrianism , and the automobile has , with the wealthy and fashionable , wrought still further mischief ; but inasmuch as far fewer can afford to own motor-cars than bicycles , and as the speedier vehicle has well-nigh put its prede - cessor out of use , perhaps walking may yet regain something of its former vogue , at least with the multitude who are not blessed -LRB- or cursed -RRB- with a motor-car income .

		To be sure , there is the convenient and inexpensive `` trolley '' to tempt one from the pedestrian 's path of rectitude ; but it will be long before it conquers -LRB- if it ever does conquer -RRB- our more rural districts and relegates pedestrianism to the limbo of the lost arts .

		Let us quote a contemporary poet 's words on walking as a beautiful and dignified bodily exer - cise . ''

		• An idea that shall help us to walk well , '' says Mr.
Bliss Carman	PERSON	, '' is to think of the walk as a moderated run rather than to think of tbe run as a modification of the walk .

		Fancy the Flying Mercury changing feet , and you have an ideal run .

		Fancy that run slackened in speed , and you have a godlike walk . ''

		It was said of
Adelaide Neilson	LOCATION	, as the same writer reminds us , that '' to see her walk was like listening to exquisite music , so well rhymed and eloquent was her motion . ''

		In
Salvini	PERSON	's walk , too , espe - cially in the character of
Othello	LOCATION	, there was majesty of motion ; and though -LRB- or because -RRB- he played the part in bare feet , his tread was dignified .

		These and other instances tending to prove that the poetry of motion is by no means confined to dancing are cited by Mr.
Carman	PERSON	, who is himself an accomplished pedes - trian as well as a poet .

		A friend and classmate of the writer 's offers another living example of a happy marriage of poetry and pedestrianism .

		He loves the woods and mountains and lakes , and can not take a hundred steps toward them without experienc - ing a strong impulse to break into verse , prefer - ably from Byron or Scott .

		Innumerable other scraps and tags of appropriate rhyme , haunting lines that may have lain unsuspected in his memory for twenty years or more , are called to mind by the ever-changing scene .

		It is a delight to walk with him , as with one who , in his own genial way , proves how true it is that a merry -LRB- and a poetry-loving -RRB- heart goes all the day , whereas your sad and prosaic one tires in a mile .

		Essays in Every-day Philosophy .

		* The much current talk about the simple life and a return to nature is , of course , a sure sign of increasing complexity and artificiality in our way of living .

		What we really are we are least inclined to talk about .

		Nevertheless , if we will persist in not living the simple life , it may be better than nothing to discuss it and read books in praise of it , even though thereby the risk is run lest we '' divorce the Feeling from her mate the Deed . ''

		A shrewdly observant and refreshingly inde - pendent woman of rural
Indiana	LOCATION	has of late years been expressing her views on subjects of human interest to all readers , in '' The Indian - apolis News , '' and , more recently , in '' The Ladies ' Home Journal . ''

		From the pages of the latter periodical there are now collected into a smaU volume , prefaced by Mr.
Edward Bok	PERSON	, a number of these informal but well - written disquisitions on topics congenial espe - cially to women -- unless the women are too pronouncedly of the '' new '' sort .

		These brief and sensible talks , entitled collectively '' The Ideas of a Plain Country Woman , '' are credited to '' The Country Contributor , '' beneath whose modestly assumed anonymity we will not seek to penetrate .

		That she is possessed of a keen sense of humor is made delightfully evident again and again , but nowhere more conclusively than in her regretful admission that women are • The Ideas of a Plain Country Woman .

		836 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, sadly lacking in this sense . ''

		I wish , '' she declares , `` that when Adam gave up that rib he had also parted with some of the funny-bone , so that his help-meet might be able to see the joke oftener . ''

		The writer is a wife and mother , and she praises and ennobles the homely joys of domestic life .

		Almost she persuades one that the lot of even a prairie farmer 's wife is richly blessed and beyond aU others desirable .

		To Miss
Zephine Humphrey	PERSON	, life with aU its joys and sorrows , and even its petty anxieties and vexations , is immensely interesting and decidedly worth living .

		Such at least is the impression one gets of her in reading '' Over Against Green Peak , '' wherein she describes , with freshness and gusto , her selection and pur - chase of an old house in rural
New England	LOCATION	, and her moving into and living in it with ''
Aimt Susan	PERSON	'' and ''
Jane	PERSON	, '' and , after a little , ''
Brid	PERSON	- get . ''

		Experiments with abandoned farms have already furnished forth literature in abundance , but that detracts nothing from the merits of Miss
Humphrey	PERSON	's venture in the same field .

		Her story is told out of her own experience , one can - not but believe ; and if here and there , for the sake of effect , she over-accentuates a note or strains her reader 's credulity -- as in her account of the butcher 's carts that drove madly by her door in a feverish haste to escape her patronage -- that must be excused as literary license .

		But it makes one thirsty to think of all the dinners of dried beef those three women had to eat in consequence of the very un - Yankeelike , uncom - mercial conduct of those meat-peddlers .

		Of all the experiences related in the book , one of the most enjoyable , to a book-reviewer at any rate , is the account of the putting in order of the library .

		Here is what is said of the little corner bookcase that held the collection of essays : `` All there , my hearties ?

		Then all is well .

		The assortment here is the least creditable , from a book col - lector 's point of view , of any the house contains .

		Odd , ragged volumes , mismated , despoiled , vagabonds of the shelf , merry survivors of statelier times when the gar - ments were at least stiff and new which now hang about them so recklessly , they look out into the room with a certain disreputable good-cheer which is quite irresist - ible .

		Their demoralization is completed by the fact that there is never a time when some two or three of them are not leaning confidingly across space to take advantage of the temporary absence of a next neighbor and have a chat with a next neighbor but one . ''

		Although we have selected the only bookish chapter in the volume for purposes of quotation , it must not be supposed that the book as a whole is not as fresh and exhilarating , tp nature-lovers , as the mountain air and mountain scenery that have largely inspired it .

		Like
Miss Humphrey	PERSON	, Miss
Helen M. Wins	PERSON	- low has a penchant for old run-to-seed farms , a humorous way of describing country scenes and events , and a fresh unconventional manner of looking at life 's problems and perplexities .

		In her '' Spinster Farm '' we are made acquainted with some original though not too clearly drawn characters , -- the Spinster ,
Janet Fleming	PERSON	by name , who purchases the farm and engages in chicken-raising ; her lively young niece
Peggy	PERSON	; the Professor , who pays persistent court to the Spinster ; young Robert Graves , who does the same to
Peggy	LOCATION	; and the humbler characters playing their useful parts in kitchen and barn .

		Homely reality is interspersed with romance ; but far be it from the reviewer to reveal the plot and spoil the story for others .

		Rather let it suffice here to give a specimen or two of the Spinster 's philosophy of life .

		Listen to her praises of rural as contrasted with urban existence . ''

		When I go into the city , to-day , I see everywhere the man with the muck-rake , his eyes ever on the ground , insensible to the world of beauty around him .

		People hurry on with eager , strained faces , wildly pur - suing the unattainable ; or , if it proves to be attainable , to what end ?

		The best countenances have a weary , unrested look ; the worst are worse than I ever realized before .

		So much of the real essence of life is lost to these hurried and breathless ones .

		I thank God for the privilege of living where I may look up to the stars and listen with quiet heart for the music of the spheres .

		After a day of noise , of struggling with pushing , jostling crowds in the city , the old low-ceilinged living - room , with its cheerful wood fire in the ancient fire - place , its comfortable old chairs , its books and its home atmosphere , seems to me the most refreshing spot on earth . ''

		And who would not wish to be an old maid after reading the following ?

		`` Things are altogether changed from the previous generation .

		To-day the old maid does not wear herself out working for her brother 's family or taking care of her sister 's children .

		If she has no money she teaches , or lectures , or writes books or poems , or she does anything but hang on the coat-skirts of somebody 's husband , and she feels self-respecting and self-dependent in conse - quence .

		She is as bright and happy as any young girl , and even better to those who have outgrown bread and butter .

		She has sense as well as freshness , conversa ^ tional power and wit as well as downright ability and good looks .

		She has live poets and notables and phil - osophers in her train .

		She wears well-fittmg gowns .

		... She does n't care whether she is married or not ; at least , one would never know if she does . ''

		The numerous illustrations from photographs , showing among other things the farm-house or '' mansion '' from two points of view , and also the spinster herself , help to make the story very real ; and if more were needed , we have the publishers ' word for it that '' most of the inci -

		THE DIAL 337 dents and all of the characters are real , as well as the farm and farmhouse , unchanged since Colonial days . ''

		What is one man 's paradox is another man 's platitude .

		So says
Bagshot	LOCATION	, and the saying is likely to prove its truth in the different impres - sion his utterances -LRB- as recorded in `` The Com - ments of Bagshot '' -RRB- will make on different readers .

		But no one , unless hopelessly didl and unimpressionable , can fail to find something re - freshingly original in many of
Bagshot	LOCATION	's opinions and judgments of men and things .

		Bagshot , let it be imderstood , owes his being to Mr.
J. A. Spender	PERSON	, whose name will sound not unfamiliar to those acquainted with the novels of Mrs.
J. K. Spender	PERSON	, his mother .

		Mr.
Spender	PERSON	chooses to style himself '' editor '' of the Bagshottian par - adoxes and platitudes , and gravely informs us that poor
Bagshot	LOCATION	is now no more ; but of course we all know what that kind of preface to this kind of book means in these days , and of course the writer himself knows that we know .

		Mr.
Spender	PERSON	's little volume is , in one respect at least , an improvement on its Bensonian arche - type : its chapters are of sententious brevity , and the book is ended long before the reader be - comes conscious of that fatigue which unbroken monologue , even from the brightest of essayists , tends to induce unless taken by snatches and read non-consecutively .

		These miscellaneous and widely-ranging comments are often so epigram - matically put as to make them very quotable .

		Here , for example , are a few neatly-expressed Bagshottisms . ''

		The common saying that you should know every - thing of something and something of everything Bagshot paraphrases as follows : ' It is necessary to fathom one 's ignorance on one suhject in order to discover how Uttle one knows on other subjects . ' '

		If the modern world abandons the religious idea of sin it will have to recover the Greek idea of virtue as a fine art .

		It is a pity that the two can not be combined .

		The next nation which leads mankind to a higher level of conduct will be one which adds conscience to instinctive good taste . '

		`` A large number of scholars are men of science gone astray , and many editions of classical authors are but chemical analyses of their component parts , from which the ele - ment of literature is excluded . '

		` If science enlarges the bounds of knowledge , it also enormously expands our conception of the unknown .

		The modern positive and scientific world has a sense of mystery which was altogether lacking in the ancient and mediseval world , and which is akin to the mysticism of the
East	LOCATION	.

		The scientific age is that which has the measure of its own ignorance .

		^ ' It is a solemn fact that the discovery of a new disease immediately creates a demand for it . ' ''

		Bagshot 's first appearance was made in '' The Westminster Gazette , '' of which Mr.
Spender	PERSON	is editor ; and these chapters are reprinted from its pages , where they seem to have attracted unusual attention .

		Their brightness and originality make them well worthy of republication in their pres - ent more convenient and permanent form .

		Mr.
Hubert Bland	PERSON	, author of '' Letters to a Daughter , '' and joint author -LRB- with his wife , ``
E. Nesbit	PERSON	'' -RRB- of `` The Prophet 's
Mantle	PERSON	, '' cheerfully reappears in '' The Happy Moralist , '' a collection of comments and opinions on liter - ature , art , music , socialism , love , marriage , ethics , and numerous other topics of interest to everybody , and offering endless possibilities of novel treatment at the hands of each successive essayist .

		Mr.
Bland	PERSON	's style is piquant , now and then a little cynical , characterized throughout by this-worldlLness rather than other-worldliness , but never other than light and bright and breezy and thoroughly readable .

		His advice on reading presents pretty well the man and his methods as a writer . ''

		My advice in the matter of literature is , browse freely among books , rifle a library as you would rifle a garden ; confine yourself to no author , to no subject , to no century .

		Boggle not a moment to lay down
Milton	PERSON	and to take up
Herrick	PERSON	; turn without a qualm of con - science from The Pilgrim 's Progress to The Decameron , from
Burton	PERSON	's Anatomy of Melancholy to the Arabian Nights of the other
Burton	PERSON	. ''

		His counsel to read dead authors rather than liv - ing ones , and to select the books that have sur - vived , is old and excellent ; but how would there ever be any survival of the fittest if all readers fol - lowed this advice and waited to see what should be cast aside as ephemeral , and what preserved for posterity ?

		Let no man shirk his part in the work of weeding out the worthless .

		In the domain of art , more especially modern French art , the author thus expresses himself : '' Remember the aim of Art is not to inculcate morality , but to give the Thrill .

		You can get the Thrill easily enough , if you put yourself in the right mood , from all these gracious curves and contours , these delicate flesh tints , these charming draperies .

		They are the kisses of art , as it were .

		Neither art nor life must be all kisses , but still there is room for kisses both in art and life .

		There is a time to kiss and a time to refrain from kissing -- a much longer time , alas !

		Well , these brilliant Frenchmen chose the time to kiss , and they immortalized it upon their canvas . ''

		In words reminiscent of
Emerson	LOCATION	, to whom he acknowledges his indebtedness , Mr.
Bland	PERSON	epi - grammatically says that '' the gist of Good Man - ners is to have none . ''

		Of all the verbs which authors so ingeniously use to avoid over - working the verb '' say , '' this author has gone far in his quest of the unhackneyed in employing the verb '' shrug . ''

		Many of the
Happy Moralist	ORGANIZATION	's chap - ters are in dialogue form , with a woman as the 838 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, Moralist 's interlocutor -- which makes for light - ness and grace , and relieves the monotony .

		Those who habitually shun '' improving '' reading will like Mr.
Bland	PERSON	's sophisticated and sufficiently superficial treatment of his themes .

		In '' The New Plato , or Socrates Redivivus , '' our old friend the humorist ''
Tom '' Masson	PERSON	reappears under the more dignified signature
Thomas L. Masson	PERSON	, but with as much love of fun and laughter as of yore .

		The temptation to parody the Platonic dialogue has been yielded to by others before Mr.
Masson	PERSON	, but probably no parodist has so struck the modern note as he has done in his ten brief colloquies on such subjects as marriage , gambling in stocks , bridge-playing , the tariff , the missionary , college education , socialism , and happiness .

		His English imitates successfully , and often amusingly , the
Jowett	PERSON	style ; in fact , it is plain that Mr.
Masson	PERSON	is no close student of the original Greek , nor need he be for his present purpose .

		Yet he would have done well to submit his proof-sheets to a Greek scholar before publication .

		Our old Platonic acquaintance Adeimantos repeatedly appears in '' The New Plato '' under the impos - sible form Adaeimantus , and '' gynseconitis , '' to denote -LRB- apparently -RRB- a woman 's club or club - building , is not happy .

		The classic tone , so well preserved for the most part in the
Jowett	PERSON	- like forms of expression , is now and then put at discord with a neologism that approaches very near to slang . ''

		All over , '' for '' everywhere , '' would never have been used by the Master of BaUiol , nor , probably , '' that is right , '' to indicate simple assent .

		As a sample of Mr.
Masson	PERSON	's wares , here is the close of a short dis - cussion of the tariif between
Socrates	PERSON	and Car - nigas .

		Carnigas speaks : '' I might say to you that the Tariff benefits the few at the expense of the many , and that is why it is imposed on all necessities except laborers .

		For the finan - ciers who control the
State	ORGANIZATION	wish to keep the price of everything high which they sell ; but labor , which they huy ^ they wish to obtain at the lowest price .

		But if I said all this you would not believe me . ''

		To which
Socrates	PERSON	replies : '' O Carnigas , how then could I help but believe you , seeing that you have become so rich by just such a method ? '' ''

		The essay , '' says Sir
Conan Doyle	PERSON	toward the end of his collected talks on books -LRB- under the attractive title '' Through the Magic Door '' -RRB- , '' must always be a somewhat repellant form of literature , unless it be handled with the lightest and deftest touch .

		It is too reminiscent of the school themes of our boyhood -- to put a head - ing and then to show what you can get under it . ''

		How true , alas , will both readers and writers of essays acknowledge that to be !

		Perhaps to avoid illustrating its truth , as far as possible , the author of '' Through the Magic Door '' has refrained from headings altogether , after having once named his book .

		The unnamed chapters are inspired by the writer 's old oak bookcase containing his favorite volumes , and he is led on to talk , confidentially and informally , about novels , poetry , history , essays , science , in a way that proves his own wide range of literary likings and also tends to broaden his reader 's outlook on the world of letters .

		The magic door is , of course , the door leading into the world of the imagination as depicted in the books of great authors .

		In his closing paragraph the writer modestly says to his readers : '' If I have put you on the track of anything which you did not know before , then verify it and pass it on .

		If I have not , there is no harm done , save that my breath and your time have been wasted .

		There may be a score of mistakes in what I have said -- is it not the privilege of the conversationalist to misquote ?

		My judgments may differ very far from yours , and my likings may be your abhorrence ; but the mere thinking and talking of books is in itself good , be the upshot what it may . ''

		The misquotations -LRB- not bad ones -RRB- are there , and the literary judgments are necessarily of debat - able soundness .

		How many readers , for instance , would make '' The Cloister and the Hearth '' a greater novel than '' Ivanhoe '' ?

		However , we are none the less indebted to this writer of novels for letting us know , in so pleasant a way , what are some of his favorites among novels , as also among works of a more serious nature .

		As an essayist and critic his style is informal and agreeable .

		In the opening pages of '' The Diary of a Looker-on '' Mr.
C. Lewis	PERSON	Hind frankly con - fesses that he has never read ''
Don Quixote	PERSON	, '' although he has read and heard so much about it that , before stopping to reflect , he was almost persuaded that his knowledge was first-hand .

		Asking others whether they had read the book , he could find no one who had done so .

		`` If you mean right through from beginning to end , I have n't , '' was the candid answer of one per - son , and the substance of several other answers .

		In the same way , concerning his latest collection of hap-hazard reflections on the lesser things of life and art and literature , few if any readers will be found to have read its three hundred and thirty-four closely printed pages '' right through from beginning to end . ''

		A dedicatory preface explains that '' The Diary of a
Looker	LOCATION	- on '' took shape at the suggestion of a friend .

		THE DIAL 339 The entries are selected from '' fourteen pocket - books closely written , a day to a page , records of things fancied , seen , felt , that seemed ^ worth preserving , '' and have already appeared , wholly or in part , in various English periodicals .

		The grouping by months breaks up the book into twelve parts or chapters , but the division desig - nations might as well have been numerals , or the first twelve letters of the Greek alphabet , or the twelve labors of Hercules , so little indic - ative are they of the subjects treated .

		As Mr.
Hind	PERSON	is preeminently an art critic , let us close this notice of his freely-rambling diary with a suggestive quotation on Color , which he calls '' The confessional of personality .

		Like the wind , it is there and here at once .

		It comes from unknown store - houses , differing in glory , finding expression in

Percy F. Bicknell	PERSON	.

		In English Gardens .

		* To garden-lovers , every garden has charm ; but the English garden is superlatively the garden beautiful , with a spell in its very name .

		Books about English gardens are almost always fascinating .

		For the American gardener , dif - ferences in climate and other conditions make many of their recommendations untrustworthy ; but as inspirations to the desire for a garden that shall be not merely a place to pick flowers out of , but a thing of beauty in itself , these books are unrivalled .

		And if the possession of such a garden is denied , a garden-book with the right kind of pictures is not to be despised as a substitute .

		Just such a book is Miss
Margaret Water	PERSON	- field 's '' Flower-Grouping in English , Scotch , and Irish Gardens . ''

		Smce Miss
Waterfield	PERSON	's '' Garden Colour '' was published , she has been busy exploring and painting more gardens .

		The color-plates in the new book , of which there are more than fifty , are all from her own sketches ; but in preparing the accompanying text she has been assisted by nearly a dozen other garden-lovers .

		and species , bedding plans , and methods of cul - ture , while others lean rather toward picturesque description of general effects , -- lend largeness to the outlook of the book .

		But amid so much variety of authorship and opinion , there is no lack of essential harmony ; all the writers belong to the new school of naturalistic gardeners , who protest against any sort of stiff and formal arrangement , have a horror of '' bedding out '' and particularly of '' carpet-bedding , '' and adopt as their standard Nature 's plan of strewing one flower about with a lavish hand , or grouping together two or three of harmonious coloring .

		So , while there is a special section entitled '' Wild Garden Notes , '' all the gardens painted and described are of the delightful variety that look as if , with Topsy , they '' just growed , '' though in fact their artless effects conceal long and patient exercise of the gardener 's craft .

		Irish and Scotch gardens get high praise for their luxuriance , beautiful surroundings , and truly artistic arrangement .

		Of English gardens , those of
Cornwall	LOCATION	are given first place for both naturalness and wealth of floral treasures .

		Most of the pictures in
Miss Waterfield	LOCATION	's book will be the despair of those who must do their gardening in cramped and temporary quarters .

		Overarching trees as a background for all the most beautiful effects , century-old walls with ferns and moss in their crannies , '' grass - walks '' and borders that have been unchanged since the '40 's , -- these are not to be had in a hurry .

		Besides incidental descriptions of the best fea - tures of many lovely gardens , there are chapters devoted to suggestions for the planting of
spring	DATE	bulbs and flowering trees , for rose and lily gar - dens , for the selection of climbers for walls and pergolas , for water-gardens , and for woodland effects .

		Thus , as a garden-book at once artistic and yet fairly practical ,
Miss Waterfield	PERSON	's leaves little to be desired within its chosen field .

		Oddly enough .

		Miss
Gertrude Jekyll	PERSON	's sub - ject , `` Colour in the Flower - Garden , '' is one that
Miss Waterfield	PERSON	has already treated , though in quite a different way .

		Miss Jekyll is inter - ested in one particular garden -- her own ; and judged by pictures and descriptions , it is cer - tainly beautiful enough to give warrant for all its maker 's loving enthusiasm and to provide abundant material for many delightful books .

		Like
Miss Waterfield	PERSON	,
Miss Jekyll	LOCATION	prefers nat - ural effects .

		She believes that a garden should make a picture , or a succession of pictures ; so that color and massing are as important to the gardener as to the artist , and should be his first and constant study .

		She is anxious to impress 340 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, her readers with the fact that in gardening , as in other arts , trifles are all-important .

		If trel - lises are painted an ugly green , the effect of the loveliest roses is marred .

		Supporting sticks must be concealed ; bare spaces must be tem - porarily filled while the plants in the border are growing to cover them .

		And as in this imper - fect world no bed can be in perfection for more than a month or two at a time , the skilful gar - dener must provide a succession of beauties so arranged that the right one will catch the eye at the right moment .

		One exception Miss JekyU admits to the rule of not trying to patch up one season 's border to look well in another : the bulb-bed , that problem of the amateur gar - dener , is too unsightly to remain through the
summer	DATE	.

		Miss
Jekyll	ORGANIZATION	's happy suggestion is to plant ferns in the bed , instead of scattered clumps of herbaceous plants .

		These wiQ cover the bare spaces better and wUl not require any of the digging so injurious to the bulbs in mid -
summer	DATE	.

		Miss JekyU pays an innocent tribute to her faculty for imparting the charm of her garden in previous books about it , when , in her pre - face , she begs her '' kind readers not to take it amiss '' if she says that she can not admit strangers to her garden , which is at once '' her workshop , her private study , and place of rest , '' and asks them to spare her failing sight the task of writing '' long letters of excuse and explanation . ''

		We can scarcely blame the over - enthusiastic persons who have unwittingly made Miss
Jekyll	ORGANIZATION	's life a burden .

		The photographs of her garden are tantalizingly lovely , and , colored by her vivid descriptions and suggestive comment , they are calculated to make every garden-lover sigh with envy .

		Ten acres of woodland threaded by alluring paths , carpeted here and there with daffodils and primroses , and cleverly blended with the garden proper ; a
June	DATE	garden , a border for late
summer	DATE	, a tiny '' hid - den garden , '' a grey garden , which ought .

		Miss
Jekyll	ORGANIZATION	explains , to have a gold garden beside it , -- these are only a few of Miss
Jekyll	ORGANIZATION	's treasures .

		Besides the pictures , there are de - tailed plans of many of the beds , and of some beds she would like to have if there were room for them .

		Everyone with a trace of gardening instinct will enjoy Miss
Jekyll	ORGANIZATION	's book , and those who work under anything like the same condi - tions will find it very helpful .

		The formal garden gets its share of attention in '' The Gardens of
England	LOCATION	in the Southern and Western Counties , '' being the special mid -
winter	DATE	number of '' The Studio '' for
1907-8	DATE	.

		It is edited by Mr.
Charles Holme	PERSON	; and Mr.
A. L. Baldry	PERSON	signs one of the three articles that make up the text .

		Of the hundred and thirty-six illustrations , eight are in color , the work of various artists , and the rest are from excellent photographs .

		In contrast to Miss
Waterfield	PERSON	and her coadjutors , and to
Miss Jekyll	PERSON	, the taste of the makers of this book leans toward the formal style of garden and the more studied type of landscaping .

		But gar - dening on a very large and sumptuous scale is bound to be somewhat formal ; and it is the great garden , -- with its marble statues and seats , its sun-dials and fountains , its majestic avenues and its grass-walks stretching between hedges of box or mossy walls of clipped yew , -- with which this monograph is concerned , both in pictures and text .

		A brief '' History of Garden-making '' traces the progress of the art from the quaint mediaeval type through the various stages of formality , fantasy , and pseudo - naturalism , to the intelligently composite style of to-day . ''

		The Principles of Garden-making '' formulates briefly such general rules as the necessity of keeping the garden in relation to the house and the site , and discusses the proper combination of formal gardening and landscap - ing .

		There is also a chapter of suggestive notes on the illustrations .

		Of these , the ones in black and white are very beautiful ; several of the colored plates show such a riot of hues as might possibly be pleasing in nature , but is certainly garish in art .

		THE DIAL 341 sonal association and acquaintance .

		Where is the happy child who has not played beneath these sheltering arms , or laughed to watch the flickering shadows of these leaves ?

		Where is the full-grown man , toiling beneath the heat and burden of the day , who has not found refreshing beneath the shades of some familiar tree ?

		And where is he who does not hope to find at length a longer rest beneath some
Bethel	LOCATION	oak , some whispering pine ?

		Our lives begin and end among the trees .

		This is the ordinary , the personal , shall we say the sentimental view of the subject .

		But there are other and more practical ways of looking at this strange type of vegetation .

		Utility asserts itself .

		Trees make forests for the mountain 's cover , fuel for the fire , beams for the palace and the home ; and architecture of every school pro- claims to them its obligation .

		The Gothic arch springs in the pattern of the elm , and all the graceful columns of the farther East are but the shafts of trees crowned in the richness of their flowers and leaves .

		Nay , the forests of earth are its wealth , the wealth of men and peoples .

		Uncounted millions do not tell their value ; the gold of the
Sierras	LOCATION	and the silver of
Nevada	LOCATION	have not equalled it .

		Even as these sentences are written , the President of the Republic , the Governors of all the States , are met in Wash - ington to play statesmen , if possible , for once ; to see whether perchance the preservation of the natural wealth of trees is a thing feasible under republican institutions , or whether stupid greed shall rule , while
California	LOCATION	and the
Caro	PERSON	- linas are made over into deserts even as
Palestine	LOCATION	and
Spain	LOCATION	and all the dead empires of the
East	LOCATION	.

		Small wonder , when we come to think of it , that men still write and read and study the books that tell of trees !

		Of the three tree-books treated in this article , the first in the list is by far the most pretentious and important .

		Dr.
Britton	PERSON	's work on '' North American Trees '' constitutes the third volume of a proposed extended series , the '' American Nature Series , '' which shall present in popular and yet scientific style the whole realm of the living world in arrangement , form , and function .

		We have here , accordingly , a descriptive list of all arboreal plants growing spontaneously in
North America	LOCATION	north of our Mexican boundary .

		This includes , therefore , not only plants indige - nous , but also such types as , having been intro - duced from other countries , have now escaped cultivation and established themselves as part of our common flora .

		Besides , there is included here every species which , though usually a shrub , does sometimes aspire to tree-hood by offering a single stem .

		Furthermore , the yuccas are described ; but the cacti are omitted .

		In aU , perhaps it is safe to say that we have here the longest list of the kind ever offered to English readers .

		The descriptions , while scientific , are in gen - eral easy of comprehension ; and since each specific characterization is accompanied by a wood-cut sketch intended to show detail of leaf and flower and fruit , identification of the mate - rial collected , anywhere from Klondike swamps to the everglades and even the islands of
Florida	LOCATION	, would seem a simple matter .

		The specific dis - tinctions are , however , often slight , and in some cases are confessedly illusive ; so that the student must sometimes be guided by locality rather than description .

		The text illustrations are , as far as pertinent , from
Britton	PERSON	and
Brown	PERSON	's '' North American Flora '' ; additional cuts illustrate in similar fashion all species extra-limitary to that work .

		Besides these , we have in the present volume some sixty half-tone reproductions of photo - graphs which afford an idea of the particular species as illustrated by a typical specimen often in its natural surroundings .

		As the work is intended as a hand-book , there is less occasion for a display of literary style .

		The author contents himself generally with a simple recital of the distinguishing character - istics of his plant , not without reference , how - ever , to its relationships and its uses .

		Even the splendor of the glorious sugar-pine , or the majesty of the hoary sequoias , fails to stir him to emotional expression .

		The tweedle-dum and tweedle-dee of nomen - clature , and all the inconsistency of the disfigur - ing use of capitals in common and scientific names , need not here detain us ; but one might have hoped that even a poor cottonwood should have attained immortality under some other specific designation than tweedyi .

		The photographic illustrations are in general not so good as this splendid book deserves .

		They fail of doing justice to the subject .

		If a species is to be so portrayed , a specimen for photograph - ing should be chosen which , if possible , will show the characteristic pose where the type is growing at its fairest ; not the poor stunted specimen of park or planting .

		In this book the palms , for this reason , are well shown .

		The figures of the white pine and the hackberry , the sycamore and the live-oak , do not , as it seems to us , even in far-away fashion suggest the beauty and sym - metry of these noble trees as still seen in their 342 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, valley homes from
Wisconsin	LOCATION	and
Minnesota	LOCATION	to the
Louisiana	LOCATION	delta .

		The same criticism must be made on the illustrations offered by Messrs.
Emerson	PERSON	and Weed , in their work entitled '' Our Trees : How to Know Them . ''

		Their volume lays special claim to utility on account of its plates .

		The photo-engravings of leaf and flower are good : those that display the tree itself are not .

		The figure of the cottonwood , for instance , wotdd never suggest the splendid tree familiar to every lover of nature who has crossed our western prairies .

		Mr.

Izaak	PERSON	, patron of good fishermen of the elder day , trolling for sea-bats or devil-fish larger than the favorite English punt , exchanging the calm perfection of his typical cloudy day for the fish - ing in
Florida	LOCATION	which Mr. Holder describes as '' sitting in a Turkish bath holding a string , '' and all in the interest of the art piscatorial !

		Yet this appears to be one of the mildest of the diversions so graphically pictured -- and photo - graphed -- in '' Big Game at Sea , '' wherein squids , octopusses -LRB- octopodes or octopi ? -RRB-

		The capture of some of these giants of the deep appears to be much the same sort of diver - sion that the prairie Indians found in attempting to lassoo the earlier locomotives of the trans - continental lines : in a number of authentic cases the fish took the man , and made off with him , boat and all .

		The excitement of the chase is undoubted , and Mr.

		THE DIAL 343 hundred pounds , and may yet be taken by a skilful angler with the ordinary light tackle ! ''

		In the Woods and on the Shore '' is Mr.
Richard D. Ware	PERSON	's narrative of the good times he has been having at various times and places with furred , horned , and feathered creatures in their native wilds .

		Much of his endeavor has been in
Newfoundland	LOCATION	after caribou , the New World variety of the reindeer .

		But the large and uncomely moose has been successfully pursued by him in
New Brunswick	LOCATION	; the black bear in assorted sizes , one of them about as big as a polo pony , fell to his prowess ; and to justify the second clause of his title , he shot wild geese , ducks , brant , and many smaller sorts of birds , and went a-fishing often as well as early .

		The book has a human side , too , for there seems no better way to become acquainted with one 's fellows -- not even the French method , of dividing an inheritance with them -- than by camping out in the wilds with them for a season .

		On some of his longest expeditions , Mrs.
Ware	PERSON	was a member of the hard-working company ; so that this book , unlike most of its fellows , has a feminine touch added to its other desirable features .

		The influence of the woods , coupled with the single-mindedness of the sportsman , has given a simplicity and directness to the style that is good to meet , and the pages may be aptly described as spacious .

		After Mr.
Holder	PERSON	's heroic bouts with piscine mammoths , Mr.
James A. Henshall	PERSON	's '' Favorite Fish and Fishing '' seems tame , but it is at least the work of one of the world 's great authorities on the topics of which it treats .

		The smaller game-fish of the North American continent are given full attention , and the work is an authentic natural history within its limits , as well as a guide to the genuine follower of
Walton	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Henshall	PERSON	knows the literature of his gentle art as well as its practical side , and he sets forth his descriptions with an enthusiasm and a grace that are decidedly alluring .

		Fishing is , after all , a serious business sometimes -- as all can attest who have seen stout gentlemen solemnly making casts over a grass plot in a city park miles from any water ; and this side of the art is never absent from these pages , though not with the same lack of humor .

		The book is profusely illustrated , every fish discussed having had his portrait taken by an artist of repute ; in addi - tion , there are many reproduced instantaneous photographs , some of them actually showing the fish leaping after a strike .

		Mr.
Edward Breck	PERSON	's book , '' The Wav of the
Woods	LOCATION	, '' has for its sub-title '' A Manual for Sportsmen in the
Northeastern United States	LOCATION	and
Canada	LOCATION	, '' and it fully justifies this in a thorough-going , practical manner .

		It is to such books as these that one goes for information about what to take to the woods to insure com - fort and health in the way of equipment and commissary .

		Illustrated with diagrams and photographs of actual camp-scenes , the novice can gain information from it which will enable him to avoid many mistakes -- even when it comes to taking photographs .

		It goes so far as to discuss quite exhaustively the several prob - lems presented by having women in the party ; it deals with possible illness and injuries , and it ends with a good working bibliography where - from further knowledge may be gained .

		Nature 's `` Fine Print . ''

		* '' We all read the large type -LSB- of Nature -RSB- more or less appreciatively , '' says Mr.
Bur	PERSON	- roughs , '' but only the students and lovers of Nature read the fine lines and the footnotes . ''

		His own excellent reading of the fine lines , as well as his uncommon appreciation of large type , is newly exemplified by '' Leaf and Tendril , '' a compilation of recent magazine articles .

		To the question of animal intelligence , which is the part of
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's fine print under most careful scrutiny at present , Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	de - votes considerable space .

		And the fact that Mrs.
Olive Thorne Miller	PERSON	, who is also a close student , presents an interpretation exactly the opposite of his , shows how baffling Nature 's text is at this point .

		Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	's belief that '' the animal is a bundle of instincts , impulses , affinities , appetites , and race traits , without the extra gift of reason , '' is well known .

		Mrs.
Miller	PERSON	begins her study with the remark that '' To study them intelligently we have even now first to divest ourselves of the old-time notion that birds -- and beasts as well -- are radically different from ourselves , that in place of the reason which governs , or should govern , our conduct , they possess only a blind instinct . ''

		Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	thinks that the idea of the individuality of birds and animals has been greatly over-emphasized .

		344 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, what is true of one member of a species is '' practically true of all the others . ''

		Mrs.
Miller	PERSON	quotes with approval from '' A Son of the Marshes '' a quite contrary opinion : `` A practical naturalist knows that all animals vary ; and you will find as much difference , compara - tively speaking , in the sizes and dispositions of a nest of young birds , or a litter of animals , as you will in a family of human beings . ''

		Mrs.
Miller	PERSON	upholds the theory of animal `` altruism , '' of the education of the young by their parents -- and even by their older brothers and sisters , -- and of sympathy and self-sacrifice ; while Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	turns a skeptical ear to the stories which apparently prove such theories .

		It is rather discouraging when two such authen - tic naturalists show by their disagreement that
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's fine print with regard to animal psy - chology has not yet been deciphered .

		But let us have patience , even though the study seems long ; for when we have learned how far animals are controlled by inherited impulses , and how far by reason , we shall have begun the solution of the problem with regard to man himself .

		Mrs.
Miller	PERSON	's book has to do with birds only , and collects much evidence from eminent natu - ralists with regard to these disputed points .

		It will be a valuable defense for those who uphold the same theories , though for pure delight in the reading one can not help grudging the pages that are thus taken from the writer 's record of her own discoveries .

		The scope of Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	's book is broader , including much on the general subject of Nature - study , with specific references to plants , animals , birds -- and men .

		To this are added some self - revealing statements of his own philosophy .

		If Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	should not write another book -- may the fear prove unfounded !

		-- we shall have in '' Leaf and Tendril '' the summary of his belief on many great questions .

		With him , the study of '' fine print '' has not led to the foot-note habit of mind , but to the developing and correlation of thought .

		His philosophy is of the wholesome and kindly sort which we like to think belongs to those who live much out-of-doors .

		He has practised and approved the simple life -- the '' direct and immediate contact with things , with the false wrappings torn away . ''

		He has worked the '' divine soil , '' and learned from it that `` the true inwardness of this gross visible world tran - scends anything we have dreamed of super - terrestrial bodies . ''

		He has found '' a God in the common , the near , always present , always active , always creating the world anew . ''

		He admits that evil follows good as its shadow ; it is '' inseparable from the constitution of things . ''

		Yet still he is content , coming to this cheerful conclusion : `` I would gladly chant a psean for the world as I find it .

		What a migjity inter - esting place to live in !

		If I had my life to live over again , and had my choice of celestial abodes , I am sure I should take this planet , and I should choose these men and women for my friends and companions . ''

Sea	ORGANIZATION	.

		* It is fortunate for science that the
Earl of Crawford	ORGANIZATION	is a sufferer from chronic rheumatism and asthma .

		We are not altogether sure that it is not fortunate for the Earl himself ; at least he informs us that the impossibility of remaining to face the cold and damp of English winters has been the cause of his wanderings , -- of voyages which have led him to many little-known shores , and given him innumerable experiences which any man might envy .

		In 1 902 he was preparing to go round the world in his splendid yacht , the ''
Valhalla	LOCATION	, '' when it was suggested to him that he really ought to bring back something for the British Museum .

		Being himself a trustee of that institution , he naturally regarded the idea with favor , and as a means of carrying it out took steps to add a naturalist to his party .

		Thus it happened that Mr.
Michael J. Nicoll	PERSON	made three voyages in the ''
Valhalla	LOCATION	, '' and wrote the book which is now before us .

		The work is not , and makes no pretense to be , a classic of travel , like
Wallace	PERSON	's '' Malay Archipelago '' or
Darwin	PERSON	's '' Beagle . ''

		It is merely a pleasantly written accoimt of the writer 's experiences , accompanied by many ex - cellent pictures of scenery and birds .

		There are no important generalizations or philosophical observations , no noteworthy contributions to geography or sociology , no ambitious attempts at word painting .

		There is , instead , a simple realism which permits the reader to accompany the author in thought to the various remote islands visited , to see them more or less as he saw them , and to search with him for the rare and new birds so many of them harbored .

		We approach a remote island in the
Atlantic	LOCATION	or the
Pacific	LOCATION	.

		It has , perhaps , never been visited by any naturalist ; or if so visited , only long ago and for a short time .

		THE DIAL 345 appear on the horizon , we wonder what birds and other creatures may live upon it .

		Nearly all such islands have pecidiar isolated species , found nowhere else in the world .

		Coming nearer , we see vegetation ; that looks promising .

		Can we land ?

		There is a heavy sea on , and the surf breaks noisily upon the beach .

		Sometimes it proves necessary to go away without landing , leaving the prospective discoveries to some more fortunate time and man ; but usually a way is found to get to shore , and then the hunt begins .

		Is there any land bird ?

		If so , it is practically certain to be new .

		The peak must be climbed , and the forests examined , or something will be missed .

		Thus we are led on , until we learn of success or failure , and the return to the ship , always a little regretfully and too soon .

		In the course of the three voyages , eleven entirely new birds were obtained , all on islands .

		In addition , many interesting observations were made on little-known species , and some good material was collected in other groups of ani - mals .

		Thus on the island of
Aldabra	LOCATION	, north of
Madagascar	LOCATION	, the very rare
Abbott	ORGANIZATION	's Ibis , known from no other place , was found .

		Mr.
Nicoll	PERSON	was very anxious to obtain a photograph , and approached a group of them very cautiously with his camera .

		The precaution was needless ; the birds , not accustomed to the wiles of man , were not only fearless , `` but so inquisitive that they waded across the pool , and , coming close up to the camera , began to peck at the tripod .

		We drove them back to the rocks , but before a plate could be exposed they were back again inspecting the legs of the camera ; it was only by repeated threats -- a novel experience for them and for us -- that we could keep them far enough away to enable us to get a series of photographs in proper perspective '' -LRB- p. 121 -RRB- .

		The result , as presented to us in the book , is a couple of the finest bird pictures we have ever seen .

		We can not take the space to tell here about the visit to
Easter Island	LOCATION	, and the new bird which has been seen there but could not be obtained ; about
Terra del Fuego	ORGANIZATION	and the steamer-duck ; about
Pitcaim Island	LOCATION	and the descendants of the mutineers ; about the sea - serpent , which was actually seen and is graphi - cally illustrated ; and many other things equally exciting .

		Let it suffice to commend the book equally to those who are obliged to make their voyages in an arm-chair , and to those who have the time and means to travel abroad in a cor - poreal capacity .

		* The author of '' The Log of the '
Laura	PERSON	' in Polar Seas , '' Mrs.
Bettie Fleischmann Holmes	PERSON	, may well congratulate herself on the mechanical make-up of her volume .

		The
University Press of Cambridge	ORGANIZATION	has recently been exhibiting some fine specimens of the printer 's craft , and this book is not the least beautiful it has produced .

		The paper is hand - made from an Italian mill ; the type is the exellent '' Bodoni '' face , designed and used exclusively by the
University Press	ORGANIZATION	; and the illustrations -- photo - gravure prints from untouched negatives -- are all of superlative merit .

		The half - leather binding , too , is pleasing and serviceable .

		For eleven weeks the party cruised about in search of the pic - turesque , and more especially for the big and little game which the Arctic regions afford .

		By far the most entertaining part of the book deals with the hunts for the great Polar bears .

		As thorough-going sports - men , bent on the quest of game , the party can not be blamed for any lack of sentiment ; yet the calm brutality manifested in the following account of a killing is , happily , not often encountered .

		The author fails in breathing a distinct personality into her account , -- a failure , no doubt , which may be a virtue in a log-book .

		After failing in his attempt to climb
Mount McKinley	LOCATION	, in
1903	DATE	, Dr.
Frederick A. Cook	PERSON	came to the following conclusion : `` Mt.
McKinley	PERSON	offers a unique challenge to mountain - eers , but its ascent will prove a prodigious task .

		It is the loftiest mountain in
North America	LOCATION	, the steepest mountain in the world , and the most arctic of all great mountains .

		The area of this mountain is far inland , in the heart of a most difficult and trackless country , making the transportation of men and supplies a very arduous task .

		The thick under - brush , the endless marshes , and the myriads of vicious mos - quitos bring to the traveller the troubles of the tropics .

		The necessity for fording and swimming icy streams , the almost perpetual cold rains , the camps in high altitudes of glaciers in snows and violent storms , bring to the traveller all of the discomforts of the arctic explorer .

		The prospective conqueror of
America	LOCATION	's culminating peaks will be amply rewarded , but he must be prepared to withstand the tortures of the torrids , the discomforts of the north pole seeker , combined with the hardships of the Matterhorn ascents multiplied many times . ''

		But on
September 16 , 1906	DATE	, Dr.
Cook	PERSON	, with a single companion ,
Edward Barrille	PERSON	, accomplished the ascent and stood on '' the top of the continent , '' at an altitude of 20,390 feet .

		The record of Dr.
Cook	PERSON	's two expeditions is interestingly , even thrill - ingly , told in the volume entitled '' To the Top of the Continent . ''

		Hunters , prospectors , adventurers , geographers , and the casual reader will each find food for his particular appetite in this well-told nar - rative .

		Excellent photographic illustrations , many drawings and maps , appendices written by various members of the expeditions -LRB- giving accounts of the natives , the fauna and flora , the geology , and the routes of proposed railways in
Alaska	LOCATION	-RRB- , and an excellent frontispiece in color from a painting by Mr.
Russell W. Porter	PERSON	, enhance the value and attractiveness of the volume .

		Mrs.
Fanny Bullock Workman	PERSON	and Mr.
William Hunter Workman	PERSON	, in their book entitled '' Ice-Bound Heights of the Mustagh , '' show in detail what a seri - ous sport mountain-climbing may become .

		The story of their climbs in the ice-world of the
Himalaya	ORGANIZATION	is a record of scientific observations and discoveries com - prehensible only to those who are masters of the science of geography , and of interest only to those who have some knowledge of mountain-climbing , or those who wish to enlarge their information regard - ing the physiography of the world .

		Here and there in the book the general reader will find gome ordinary statement of fact that will interest him .

		He will find pleasure in reading the descriptions of the many mountain peaks in the
Himalaya	LOCATION	which seem to bear a distinct individuality , and he will be forced to recon - struct his pigmy ideas of the vastness of the world .

		Ordinary standards of heights and distances are in - adequate in estimating the immensities of these Titanic mountains of the Mustagh . ''

		This fact , '' say the authors , `` is accounted for by the much greater altitudes and dimensions of the Himalayan snow - world , and by the wonderfully clear atmosphere which causes distant points to appear near .

		The mind is also dazed and overwhelmed by the immen - sity , and fails to comprehend it . ''

		Mr. and Mrs.
Workman	PERSON	, however , know this snow-world ; they have lived in it and have absorbed something of its atmosphere .

		Hence , their volume , though uninter - esting in many parts , gives the reader a proper con - ception of the vastness and remoteness of these giants of the earth .

		They have been fortunate , too , in their photographic work ; no such satisfactory pic - tures of mountain scenery have been published since Mr.
Douglas Freshfield	PERSON	's '' Round
Kangchenjunga	LOCATION	'' was issued in
1904	DATE	.

		We wish , however , that the authors had used their pens more in describing these impressive scenes .

		Our complaint only indicates that the writers were more scientific than literary in their pursuit ; and as mountain climbers bent on increasing the world 's knowledge of scientific geo - graphical data , they have succeeded to an unusual degree .

		It has been well said that no one knows anything about the Japanese except the Japanese themselves -- and they will not tell .

		Miss
Augusta M. Campbell Davidson	PERSON	, in her volume entitled `` Present Day
Japan	LOCATION	, '' verifies this saying by citing her many hope - less attempts to exchange ideas with the Japanese . ''

		As a rule , I observe , they do not care to tell you too much about their country 's past .

		They do not mind a picturesque legend , or a story of a grand battle , but they do not like you to know too much about their constitutional history , and it is well to betray superfluous information on points of this kind .

		There is a desire on the part of a good many of them to glide rather gently over the fact of the nonentity of the
Mikado	LOCATION	during so many centuries -LRB- to take one instance J , so as to give an air of antiquity to existing institutions .

		... I am told by those who can read them that the same tendency is to be discovered in the text-books of history used in the schools . '' ''

		If you could manage to get beliind the polite phrases of the most educated of Japanese you would find a profound conviction of the superiority of his country to every other to be at the root of his views on all subjects whatsoever .

		He certainly speaks to you very humbly about his country and very respectfully about yours .

		Everything in
Japan	LOCATION	, accord - ing to him , is poor and inferior , everything in your country all that is desirable .

		You may say as much as you like to try to convince him that there are certain things in your country that you do not particularly admire , and that you really do think much of certain things in his .

		He does not in the least mean what he says , and you may talk to the end of time without convincing him that you mean what you say ... There is not a Japanese alive who does not think his country worth any six of the countries of the
West	LOCATION	, but there is none who would be rude enough to say so .

		They act on this view all the same , and it is this , contrasted with their polite verbal depreciation , which gets them the character of being such unmitigated humbugs . ''

		These quotations will serve to show that the author has , to some extent , arrived at a fair understanding

		THE DIAL 347 of Japanese psychology .

		Her knowledge , moreover , is not mere snap observation , but is founded upon a study of the ethical forces and the national religion of the Japanese , their daily goings in and comings out , -- their social life , and their amusements .

		Though in no sense a heavy discourse , this revised edition of a series of letters home to English friends is complete in giving a wide and varied view of Japanese life .

		In brief , there are few books about
Japan	LOCATION	more illuminating and entertaining than this one .

		The principal motive of Sir
Hubert Jerningham	PERSON	's trip around the world was a desire to see
Japan	LOCATION	.

		His account of the journey , as told in the volume entitled '' From West to East , '' is consequently de - voted largely to the Land of the Rising Sun .

		More than half of the volume recounts his visits to the principal Japanese cities .

		Each city was evidently viewed for some single interesting fact or experi - ence illustrative of the general course of Japanese life .

		Thus ,
Osaka	LOCATION	invites a discourse on wealth ,
Kyota	LOCATION	on Old
Japan	LOCATION	,
Nara	LOCATION	on bronzes ,
Nagoya	LOCATION	on wrestling , and
Yokohoma	LOCATION	on Japanese art .

		Nikko interests Sir
Hubert	PERSON	because of its temples ,
Tokyo	LOCATION	because of its educational ideas , and
Kobe	PERSON	because of its progressiveness .

		Japanese religion , too , everywhere attracted Sir
Hubert	PERSON	's attention and criticism .

		Mukden and Port
Arthur	PERSON	were visited , and the famous battles which took place there are fought over again in detail , -- though the author disclaims all practical and theoretical knowledge of warfare .

		The rest of the world receives scant treatment in the volume .


San Francisco	LOCATION	,
Chicago	LOCATION	,
Niagara	LOCATION	, and
New York	LOCATION	are dismissed in the short space of one chapter .

		An appendix gives Admiral
Togo	LOCATION	's '' Report of the Battles of the Sea of
Japan	LOCATION	'' and the French text of the Treaty of
Portsmouth	LOCATION	.

		A reading of this book leads one to look upon the author 's report of his six months ' journeying as a sort of disjecta membra , written by a man who is capable of more valuable and entertaining writing than is contained in the present volume .

		Twenty-five years of drudgery at the
New York	LOCATION	bar brought Mr.
George L. Carlisle	PERSON	to the necessity of choosing between breaking down or breaking away .

		Selecting the latter course , Mr.
Carlisle	PERSON	took a year off and started on a trip around the world .

		Habits of activity with the pen would not , however , allow him to rest entirely , so he wrote an account of his journey .

		The resulting volume , entitled `` Around the World in a Year , '' would merit but little attention were it not for the author 's genial good sense , his freshness of observation , his odd turns of speech , his delightful scorn of all things praised by those more scholastically inclined , and his almost sinful disrespect for venerable objects , both sacred and profane .

		It is not given to every writer to speak in light terms of the ancient mummy of Rameses II. , to characterize the mountains of
Greece	LOCATION	as '' a fine lot of old timers , '' and to insist that the beauties of
Japan	LOCATION	have been over-praised although admitting at the same time that his view may have been perverted by a severe attack of the itch while in the
Mikado	LOCATION	's country .

		Among the places which caught Mr.
Carlisle	PERSON	's fancy and tickled his humor ,
Carlsbad	LOCATION	holds first place . ''

		It is an expensive place .

		Others go there for their health , but the hotel proprietors do not . ''

		A mud-bath ex - perience leads to some highly humorous remarks on the efficacy of this operation in relation to running for office in
America	LOCATION	.

		No country escapes without some gibe from the author 's facile pen .

		The judi - cious reader may be grieved at Mr.
Carlisle	PERSON	's irrev - erent tone , but he will find many compensations in the shrewd humor and the keen interpretations of the
New York	LOCATION	barrister .

		No one contemplating a motor trip through En - gland ,
Wales	LOCATION	, or
Scotland	LOCATION	should neglect a cursory reading of Mr.
Thomas D. Murphy	PERSON	's '' British High - ways and By-ways from a Motor Car . ''

		The volume bears a distinctive value in one respect : it recites the attractions of some of the lesser-known villages and towns seldom visited by the ' * quick-tripper . ''

		Ludlow , for example , though known to students of literary history as the place where
Milton	PERSON	's '' Comus '' was first presented , is seldom mentioned in accounts of tours in
Britain	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Murphy	PERSON	, however , is almost extravagant in his praise of the village .

		`` After visiting hundreds of historic places during our
summer	DATE	's pilgrimage , the memory of
Ludlow	ORGANIZATION	, with its quaint , unsullied , old-world air , and its magnificent church , whose melodious chime of bells lingers with us yet , its great ruined castle , redolent with romance , and its surrounding country of unmatched interest and beauty , is still the pleasantest of all .

		If we could re-visit only one of the English towns it would be Ludlow . ''

		Should any prospective traveller through
Britain	LOCATION	be fortunate enough to make his trip in a motor car , he will find Mr.
Murphy	PERSON	's book an excellent guide ; the maps of
England	LOCATION	and
Scotland	LOCATION	are suggestive road guides , and the incidental information about hotels and garages will save many moments of worry .

		The volume contains numerous and excel - lent illustrations , reproduced both in color and tint .

		Seven sketches of travel in
Italy	LOCATION	,
Sicily	LOCATION	, and
Greece	LOCATION	make up the contents of Mr.
T. R. Sullivan	PERSON	's '' Lands of
Summer	DATE	. '' ''

		Spring-Time with Theo - critus , '' the first chapter , has but little to do with spring-time , and still less with the bucolic poet ; it really recounts the author 's mishaps on a May-Day at
Catania	LOCATION	in
Sicily	LOCATION	, when he was held up in this miserable little village by labor-union decrees and strikes , thus upsetting his plans and retarding his progress toward
Greece	LOCATION	.

		In
Greece	LOCATION	, too , the un - expected and the distressing were always happen - ing , -- so much so that Mr.
Sullivan	PERSON	coined the expression , '' In
Greece	LOCATION	expect the unexpected . ''

		The author agrees with many other travellers that the road from
Corinth	LOCATION	to
Patras	LOCATION	, along the
Corinthian Gulf	ORGANIZATION	, with views '' across the blue waves to
Helicon	ORGANIZATION	and Parnassas , up the bay of Itea to the white gleam of
Delphi	ORGANIZATION	, '' is probably the finest railway journey in the world .

		Yet he chooses to dismiss the prospect 348 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, and to disappoint our hopes by the mere assertion .

		But the other chapters of the book are less disappoint - ing .

		The reader will enjoy the restful accounts of the author 's journeyings in
Tuscany	LOCATION	, of the trips from
Poppi	LOCATION	, the description of Camaldoli and of Abetone -- '' the finest spot on earth . ''

		No less interesting is the chapter entitled `` The Centenary of
Alfieri	LOCATION	at
Asti	LOCATION	. ''

		As this celebration happily coincided in
1903	DATE	with that of
Asti	ORGANIZATION	's movable autumnal feast , the vint - age , Mr.
Sullivan	PERSON	not only witnessed
Salvini	PERSON	's last performances in the dramatist 's greater plays , but also enjoyed seeing the '' continuous procession of the white oxen , bulls , or cows , yoked in pairs , '' cir - cling round the great square of
Asti	ORGANIZATION	, '' draggling loads of purple grapes along the Corso and its tributaries , to every courtyard in town . ''

		The romantically - inclined reader will find pleasure in the chapter entitled ' < The Wraith of a
Ducal City	LOCATION	, '' telling the story of how
Duke Vespasian Gonzaga	ORGANIZATION	built at Sabbioneta a marvellous city , which he intended should be only a lesser
Athens	LOCATION	.

		This
Kubla Khan	PERSON	caused streets , squares , pleasure-grounds , palaces , theatres , churches , colonnades , and triumphal arches to be planned and constructed with amazing swift - ness and incredible beauty .

		But when he died , in
1590	DATE	, the people whom he had forced to live in his capital city fled from the gilded environment , and to-day Sabbioneta stands desolate , -- '' magnificent , with empty courts and grass-grown streets , fortified against all but neglect and the treacherous enmity of time .

		Her glory had departed ; and no man ever dreamed of reviving it . ''

		Text , pictures , and binding are all of a spirit in this dainty book , making it an unusually pleasant volume for reading and possession .

		The little volume entitled ''
Panama	LOCATION	and Back '' recounts Dr.
Henry T. Byford	PERSON	's trip to the Pan -
American Medical Congress	ORGANIZATION	held at
Panama	LOCATION	in
1904	DATE	.

		His story , however , mentions only a reason - able proportion of the events which occurred at the meeting of the medical men , but contains much of the physician 's personal experience .

		The result of his observation is that , after trying everything , seeing everything , and discussing everything with learned and unlearned persons , he is convinced that everything in
Panama	LOCATION	is wrong or distorted , and everything or nearly everything in
Chicago	LOCATION	is right or nearly right .

		His summary of his trip is re - vealed in the comments , `` Very pleasant , but warm and sunshiny , '' and '' It was a great success and I got back safely . ''

		The worthy physician is never at a loss for a pun .

		In commenting on a bull-fight , he says : '' It was neither a hull fight nor a bully fight , it was merely a fight between bulls and buUies . ''

		Those who appreciate this sort of word-play will find a plethora of it in Dr.
Byford	PERSON	's book .

		The more diligent reader will occasionally find some per - tinent and sensible remarks on affairs in
Panama	LOCATION	, especially on the canal .

		The rapid pace of Mr.
John U. Higinbotham	PERSON	's dash through
the Netherlands	LOCATION	, as recorded in his volume entitled '' Three Weeks in
Holland	LOCATION	and
Belgium	LOCATION	, '' may be judged from this specimen day 's itinerary : ''
July 27	DATE	: Left Alkmaar 8:25 A. M. ; arrived Hoorn
8:45 a.m.	TIME	; left Hoorn
9:56 a.m.	TIME	; arrived
Enkhuisen 10:25 A. M.	PERSON	; boat to

Stavoren 2:57 P. M.	PERSON	; arrived Sneek 3:24 p. M. ; left
Sneek 7:12	PERSON	p. M. ; arrived Leeuwarden 7:53 p. M. '' Such a day must not be taken as wholly typical , however , for Mr.
Higinbotham	PERSON	was more leisurely at times , spending one whole day in
Amsterdam	LOCATION	, another day in
Brussels	LOCATION	, and a third day in
Antwerp	LOCATION	.

		Although the author evidently travelled with an accurately set watch in one hand and a '' rundreise '' time-table in the other , he made excellent use of his eyes .

		Of humor Mr.
Higinbotham	PERSON	has his due share , as wit - ness these examples : '' At
Assen	ORGANIZATION	we are scheduled for three hours in a fifteen-minute town . '' ''

		The Dutch have a dry sense of humor .

		Their new church in
Amsterdam	LOCATION	was built in
1408	DATE	.

		I asked the concierge if he thought the plastering thoroughly dry .

		They have also an exaggerated notion of the speed of an American pedestrian .

		If they tell you that anything is within fifteen minutes ' walk , and you reach it in half an hour , you have probably broken a record . ''

		Of the family which owns the house at Hougomont on the battlefield of
Waterloo	LOCATION	, Mr.
Higinbotham	PERSON	writes : `` They plant little biollets and souvenirs .

		These are sown in the
fall	DATE	, and the winter snows and
spring	DATE	rains bring them to per - fection .

		Early in the
summer	DATE	they are ploughed up and sold to the credulous . ''

		Mr.
Higinbotham	PERSON	's observations are so acute and well-balanced that we should like to have fuller records of his journeys .

		Those readers of books of travel who enjoy diluted facts of strange life in fictional form will find a book to their liking in
Miss Caroline Corner	ORGANIZATION	's volume bearing the title `` Ceylon : The Paradise of Adam . ''

		Having resided in the island for seven years , the author writes of the many peculiar institutions , customs , and manners of the Ceylonese .

		Much of the book is written in dialogue , with comments in solution , -- a method of composition which calls the reader 's imagination into play , but which does not entirely satisfy any desire he may have for an ex - tended explanation of Ceylonese life .

		If we are to believe the records of this volume , life in
Ceylon	ORGANIZATION	is more interesting and diverting than in any other part of the world .

		Our own view is that Miss Corner would have pleased the general reader more if she had been more expository and less fictional in her narrative .

		The '' Isle '' of Purbeck , described in Miss
Ida Woodward	PERSON	's volume entitled '' In and Around the Isle of Purbeck , '' is in reality a peninsula , situated at the south-east corner of the county of
Dorset	LOCATION	, and covering an area of one hundred and twenty square miles .

		To the local English historian , the geologist , the antiquarian , and the seeker of the picturesque , this area is of importance ; but for the general reader it has little interest .

		Celt ,
Saxon	LOCATION	, Roman , English , and even Phoenician , have left their trail in the
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 349 famous Kimmeridge clay of Purbeck ; and the English Kings , from the time of mythical Arthur to
Charles I.	PERSON	, have ever held
Purbeck	PERSON	in high honor as a place renowned for hunting .

		In its earliest days it was the scene of many miracles worked by now forgotten worthies of the church .

		In these later days it is famous for its clay , which is shipped to all parts of the world .

		But above all things , it is best known for its varied and beautiful scenery ; hills , dales , woodlands , marshes , rugged coasts , and valleys give a charm which '' age can not wither nor custom stale . ''

		For this reason .

		Miss
Woodward	PERSON	's account offers unusual opportunities to the artist , Mr.
John W. G. Bond	PERSON	, whose series of thirty-six plates in color forms a most attractive feature of the volume .

		The scene is the same as in ''

		govern themselves .

		The central political situation of the present novel is found in a compaign for the governorship -- a campaign in which the old order triumphs , but which reveals the handwriting on the wall .

		The love interest is supplied by the daughter of the railroad magnate and the son of his trusted corporation counsel .

		These are of the new genera - tion , and both have to face the problem of a duty divided between the promptings of filial piety and the clear conviction that their respective fathers are hopelessly in the wrong .

		This has long been a favorite situation with our novelists of tendency , and Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	uses it with striking success .

		Thus far we have said nothing of Mr.
Crewe	PERSON	, whom we should expect from the title of the story to be the chief figure , which he certainly is not , although he is an interesting one .

		This gentleman is a pompous and self-sufficient millionaire with a sense of duty -LRB- about equally divided between his own important self and the public -RRB- , who magnanimously decides to offer his services to the commonwealth .

		He becomes first a legislator , then a candidate for the governor - ship .

		He is so thickly encased in the armor of con - ceit that he can not dream of being taken at a less serious estimate than his own , and becomes an '' easy mark '' for the predatory politicians who flatter and bleed him at the same time .

		His is the most care - fully studied character in the novel , which perhaps justifies the title ; but the leading interest centres about the others .

		Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	, as we all know , is no outsider when it comes to writing about New Hampshire politics , and his satirical and vivid ac - count of the gubernatorial campaign shows in many ways that the writer has been in the midst of the fray .

		His book is too long , is rather loosely put together , and the manner of its setting forth is almost slovenly at times , but it is a story that has vitality , is informed by a fine idealism , and is pos - sessed of an interest that does not pall .

		`` King Spruce '' is a novel that takes us to the
Maine	LOCATION	woods under the guidance of a man who knows them , not only as a camper and nature-lover , but also as one acquainted with the practical business of lum - bering and conversant with its highly specialized dialect .

		There is too much of this technical speech for easy reading , but we do not need to understand all the terms employed to enjoy the tale , which is both virile and exciting .

		The hero is a college man , which would seem to be against him were the unfavorable impression produced by the fact not promptly modified by the information that his chief distinction had been won upon the football field .

		He finds teaching in the country school a little too tame for his taste , and sets out to beard the lumber magnate in his forest lair , having previously won the affections of the magnate 's daughter .

		His peace - ful overtures having been met with scorn and con - tumely , he proceeds to make himself really respected by starting a rival enterprise , and , incidentally , by applying the methods of scientific forestry to his work .

		He conquers the bully who acts as foreman of the enemy , dynamites the dam which gives the enemy 350 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, a motiopoly of water-rights , and outwits the organ - ization all along the line .

		King Spruce then comes to terms , and the hero marries the fair daughter with her father 's blessing .

		Mr.
Holman Day	PERSON	, the author of this book , is clearly an enthusiastic cham - pion of the cause of our wasted forests , but the cause is unobtrusively urged , which is perhaps as effective a way of urging it as the hammer-and-tongs method resorted to by others .

		That it is a cause of the ut - most importance to our national welfare will hardly be doubted by any well-informed American . ''

		Old Wives for New , '' the latest invention of Mr.
David Graham Phillips	PERSON	, is a novel with a prologue .

		The prologue is a
summer	DATE	day 's idyl in southern
Indiana	LOCATION	, the tale of a boy and a girl falling reck - lessly in love before either of them has learned any - thing of the realities of life .

		The sensuous note is forced , but the effect comes close to being poetical .

		In the long-winded tale that follows , poetry has dis - appeared , its place being taken by a particularly sor - did sort of prose .

		The boy has become a man , and even a magnate , while the girl whom he had made his wife has grown fat and slovenly .

		The author leaves nothing to our imagination on this score , for he describes the reasons for the husband 's estrange - ment with disgusting detail .

		Presently , the man goes off for a
summer	DATE	's outing in the northern wilderness , and there meets a woman whose delicacy and refine - ment are in striking contrast with the vulgarity and dowdiness of his wife .

		This woman , incidentally , is the proprietor of a fashionable dressmaking establish - ment in
New York	LOCATION	.

		The development of the story deals with the man 's efforts to obtain a divorce , and with his wife 's jealous opposition to the scheme .

		Eventually , she is forced to consent , after which she resorts to '' beauty-doctors , '' renews her youth , and succumbs to the wiles of the treacherous and fortune - seeking secretary of her former husband .

		The latter , instead of seeking at once the woman he loves , aims at first to protect her name from connection with the scandalous situation .

		This he accomplishes by the ingenious device of persuading a girl of easy virtue to go with him to
Paris	LOCATION	, and by making the most ostentatious display of their association .

		The dear public is thus diverted from its scent , and the reputa - tion of the dressmaker is saved from blemish .

		It would appear that the author expects us to consider this a most praiseworthy performance , and quite enough to condone the man 's offenses .

		It would be useless to try to find a moral in this incoherent fab - rication , which is one of the most revolting books , in both incident and general plan , that we have ever read .

		For a book not to be taken seriously in any liter - ai ' y sense , without either form or style , but having the characteristics of surprise and excitement that go to the making of an entertaining yarn , we may say a word of mild commendation in behalf of '' The Sixth Speed , '' by Mr.
E. J. Rath	PERSON	.

		It tells of an ingenious chauffeur who wearies of his menial ser - vice , calls his millionaire employer '' a damn fool , '' thereby separating himself from his job , and turns pirate in very up-to-date fashion .

		He invents , or somebody invents for him , a new motor which will propel a boat at the speed of more than a hundred miles an hour .

		His boat is secretly built and equipped , a trusty crew is secured , and he starts out to plunder the yachts of the wealthy .

		Audacity is his weapon , for all brutal arms are forbidden , and his lightning-like appearances and disappearances strike terror into the hearts of the owners of the pleasure squadron .

		The matter becomes so serious that the
United States	LOCATION	navy takes a hand , trying in vain to capture the bold buccaneer , and at last even international complications are produced by his deeds .

		A part of his equipment being a Marconi outfit , he reads all the wireless messages that are sent concerning him , and thus eludes capture .

		Huge re - wards are offered , at first for him , and then to him , with the promise of immunity , but he prefers to remain the terror of the seas .

		But an imminent war between the
United States	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	arouses his patriotism , and he decides to surrender , in order that he may place his motor at the service of the government .

		What is done to him after that we are not informed , for the closing passage of a perfunctory love story takes the place of the final explanation that we are awaiting .

		To `` The Spoilers '' succeeds `` The Barrier , '' a second story of
Alaska	LOCATION	much like the first .

		The scene is a trading-post which a lucky '' strike '' trans - forms into a mining camp ; the hero is an army officer who for the first time brings governmental authority into the region ; the heroine is a dusky maiden supposed to be a half-breed but in reality of pure white parentage ; the miscellaneous characters include two '' bad men '' and a big-hearted French Canadian who loves the heroine in secret , saves her by a daring exploit , and resigns her to his rival .

		Fighting goes on intermittently throughout the tale , and red blood courses in the veins of the men , some of it being spilled from time to time .

		It is all good thrilling conventional melodrama , written by a man with an eye for actuality and a sense of dramatic fitness . ''

		Fennel and Rue '' is hardly more than a novel - ette in volume , and rather less tha-n that in sub - stance .

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	seems to have surpassed his own previous efforts in spinning a considerable story out of a trifling incident .

		A young novelist receives a pathetic letter from an unknown young woman , takes it in good faith , and afterwards learns that it was only a trick .

		His pride is hurt , and he now takes the matter seriously in another way , writing the young woman a rather brutal letter .

		This is the prelude .

		The sequel brings the two to - gether in a country house , and he learns that his letter has had serious consequences , for the young woman is just recovering from the serious nervous illness which it occasioned .

		She is also a particu - larly nice girl .

		The conclusion would be obvious were we dealing with another than Mr.
Howells	PERSON	.

		The actual conclusion is whimsical , and anything but flattering to the hero 's conceit .

		It is all very
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 351 charming and slyly humorous in the working out , but can not be said to engage any serious interest - It is some time since we have read a story of the
American Revolution	ORGANIZATION	, and a fairly good one is now offered us by Mr.
Stephen Jenkins	PERSON	, who calls it '' A Princess and Another . ''

		The hero appears to us when a child , brought to
New York	LOCATION	by a French - woman whose services are sold in payment for her passage .

		The child is not her own , but the secret of his birth remains concealed for many years .

		The young woman is presently wooed and won by a
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	farmer of the neighborhood , and the boy thus finds a happy home among respectable hard - working people .

		His education is provided for , and at the outbreak of the war he is a fine young fellow in early twenties .

		He has an adventurous career , not becoming an ardent partisan of either cause , but serving for a time , more by accident than from conviction , in the tory ranks .

		He gets into trouble with the colonial forces , being found within their lines and taken for a spy , although his errand is of private concern only .

		Things look dark for him at first , but the devotion of the heroine produces the evidence that clears him at the critical moment , and at the same time he discovers his long-lost father in one of the French officers taking part in his trial .

		The story is mildly interesting , rather more roman - tic than real in plot and characterization , but is anchored with reasonable security to the essential facts of the historical situation . ''

		Prisoners of Chance , '' by Mr.
Randall Parrish	PERSON	, is a romance of adventure based upon the history of
Louisiana	LOCATION	in
the later eighteenth century	DATE	.

		The time is that of Spanish rule , and the story is set in opera - tion by the French attempt of
1768	DATE	to regain pos - session of the province .

		The leaders of the revolt are captured , sentenced to death , and confined upon a Spanish warship to await their execution .

		One of the prisoners is a certain
Charles de Noyan	PERSON	, married to a French girl whose hand had formerly been sought by one
Geoffrey Benteen	PERSON	, an English adventurer , who has spent many years in the wilderness fighting Indians and trading in furs .

		It is
Geoffrey	PERSON	who tells the story , which begins with his arrival in
New Orleans	LOCATION	after several years ' absence .

		His former love learns of his arrival , and appeals to him to save her husband .

		Being a resourceful man , this task is accomplished , and the three make their escape together in a boat headed up the great river .

		When the
Arkansas	LOCATION	is reached , they take to that stream , having added to their party a strange companion in the person of a red-headed
Yankee	ORGANIZATION	, a puritan preacher , valiant both as fighter and trencher-man , whose language upon all occasions is that of the con - venticle .

		Penetrating to the Ozark region , they come upon a strange tribe of natives , by whom they are taken captive .

		These natives , the author would have us believe , were the last remnant of the mound - builders , a savage race with strange rites and cus - toms .

		But , strange to say , they are ruled by a white queen , a Frenchwoman , who in some imexplained manner has gained the ascendancy over them .

		She is a cruel and passionate creature , who somehow reminds us of the '' She '' of Mr.
Rider Haggard	PERSON	's invention .

		The prisoners are condemned to be sacri - ficed , but contrive to escape after many exciting adventures , including the experience of a convulsion of nature that exterminates their savage captors , as well as the Puritan and the Frenchman .

		The latter is a poor thing , and we are not sorry to lose him , particularly as his wife is clearly predestined for
Geoffrey	PERSON	, and has loved him all the time .

		So the two survivors , being hurriedly united in marriage by a French priest conveniently produced for the pur - pose , start on their journey back to civilization , and the story ends .

		It is an excellent example of the sort of romantic narrative which Mr.
Parrish	PERSON	has cultivated with marked success , and upon which he has brought to bear the fruits of much serious his - torical investigation .

		Readers of current fiction have learned to expect a book by Mr.
J. C. Snaith	PERSON	to be something out of the ordinary . ''


William Jordan	PERSON	, Junior '' certainly fulfils this expectation , for a stranger book -- at once puzzling and fascinating -- has not often come our way .

		The hero is introduced to us as a boy , the sole companion of his father , who is a venerable scholar gaining a scant livelihood as the owner of a second-hand book shop in
London	LOCATION	.

		The boy has had almost literally no contact with the real world , and his mind has been fed upon the ancient classics to the exclusion of almost everything else .

		Greek is more familiar to him than his native English , and the only ideals he knows have been shaped by com - munion with the poets and philosophers of antiquity .

		We are called upon to follow the development of this naive and sensitive spirit as it is brought into contact with various aspects of common life , from the day when the boy first takes his father 's hand to be led out into the world of '' street persons '' to the day when the man , having toiled and suffered and felt the springs of sympathy welling up within his soul , lies upon his deathbed , leaving as his legacy to mankind a marvellous poem -- the very epic of humanity -- which has been distilled from his ex - perience .

		Four passages of his life are described for us with some particularity .

		First , the period which he spends in a day school for boys , where he first learns that there is such a thing as brutality in the world ; second , the years passed in clerical drudgery for a firm of publishers ; third , a term of imprisonment for an offence technically criminal although committed from the purest of motives ; and fourth , a season of wanderings , in which con - tact with all sorts and conditions of men is alternated with rapt communings with nature .

		These influ - ences , projected upon the background of his child - hood training , are what go to make of him a living soul , and are so blended for good and beauty that something like awe takes possession of us as we watch his dying hours .

		And to emphasize the ideal and fantastic character of this creation , the author provides for it a setting of the most unsparing real - ism , illustrated by photographic types of what passes 362 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, for humanity in modern
London	LOCATION	, made all the more vivid by touches of pungent satire , the representa - tives of actuality in both manners and speech .

		To the hero , this is all material for spiritual nurture , and his life blossoms as a water-lily from the bosom of a swamp .

		But no outline can do justice to this remarkable book .

		It puts for us in poignant modern terms some of the oldest of questions : What is reality ?

		What is the inner meaning of life ?

		What is the true path of the soul in its quest for happiness ?

		It would be too much to say that the questions are answered , but we may perhaps go so far as to say that the answers are broadly hinted at .

		Of this we are sure , that the book is one to love , and one that may act as a leaven upon the spirits that are not wholly stale , but are still capable of some sort or degree of fermentation .

		The moral of '' The Avenger '' appears to be that a man who resorts to blackmail , especially if a woman 's reputation is at his mercy , puts himself without the pale of the law , and becomes a legitimate object of private vengeance .

		Assassination becomes a virtue in such a case , and is duly meted out to two blackmailers in Mr.
Oppenheim	PERSON	's latest novel .

		The instrument of justice in this case is a retired army officer of the highest character , and we are given to understand that the author considers his conduct wholly praiseworthy .

		Since that is the point of view presented , we hardly see why the aforesaid officer should have committed suicide , which seems to be a weak concession to the bourgeois morality which the novelist scorns .

		Possibly , however , we are going far afield in seeking for a moral in a story so obviously designed for no higher purpose than that of sensa - tional entertainment .

		Considered as an invention merely , the story is neat and effective .

		The mystery is carefully guarded , and the factors which lead to its unravelling are introduced one at a time at dis - creet intervals .

		In the outcome it is cleared up , and there are no loose ends , unless we are still puzzled to know how the heroine got that latch-key , and why she turned so pale when told that the lawyer was on the track of the assassin .

		Construction is everything in such work as Mr.
Oppenheim	PERSON	has chosen to do , and in this respect he is steadUy improving .

		Miss
Elizabeth Ellis	PERSON	made her first appearance as a novelist , if we are not mistaken , about two years ago , when her story of ''
Barbara Winslow	PERSON	, Rebel '' called our attention anew to the happenings of
Monmouth Rebellion	ORGANIZATION	and the
Bloody Circuit	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was an amateurish work , but an interesting one that showed marked signs of promise .

		That the signs were not misleading is made plainly evident by '' The Fair Moon of Bath , '' now at hand .

		This is a tale of the Forty-five , that inexhaustible theme of roman - tic interest , and although it does nothing more than has been done a hundred times before , succeeds in holding our attention closely by its ingenious plot , its poetically-conceived love-interest , and its repro - duction -LRB- in the conventional manner , of course -RRB- of the speech and manners of English society in the days when
Nash	PERSON	held sovereignty at Bath .

		The Jacobite Conspiracy is a tenuous affair , and comes to naught , but it supplies an exciting basis for what is essentially a story of private character and social concern .

		Miss
Ellis	PERSON	is to be congratulated upon her success in dealing freshly with this well-worn theme .

		How
Sally Snape	PERSON	, a child of the slums , becomes Miss
Sarita Mainwaring	PERSON	, the idol of the music halls , and after that the happy wife of the still happier
Lord Kidderminster	LOCATION	, is circumstantially related in '' The Heart of a Child . ''

		Green eyes , red hair , and a certain artless grace , seem to have been the causes of this soubrette 's progress , as described by the lady who writes under the name of ''
Frank Danby	PERSON	. ''

		The heroine , we are told , preserves the childish heart in all her varied contacts with life , and this is why we are bidden to sympathize with '' Kiddie 's '' infatua - tion .

		It is not a bad reason , and is made almost con - vincing by the mass of corroborative detail brought to bear upon its support .

		Sally -LRB- or Sarita -RRB- is cer - tainly represented to us as a most engaging person , and is , moreover , a very real figure , while her lover , who appears at first as a `` Johnnie , '' grows into something quite like a man before we take leave of him .

		The author 's realism , as exhibited in her earlier books , has often come near to being disgusting , but in the present instance , save for a few touches of vul - garity , it is realism of a good and honest sort .

		She has an amazingly minute and sympathetic knowledge of the sort of life she describes , and she uses it , for the most part , discreetly and effectively .

		The gutter , the shop , and the variety stage , all contribute to the effect , and the heroine moves amid this shifting en - vironment as a distinctly individual appearance , and as a human being whose character wins and holds our respect .

		Briefs on
Books for Summer Reading	ORGANIZATION	.

		Two practical Mr.
Herman B. Dorner	PERSON	, author of Tet ^ lT the little manual of `` Window - gardener .

		Gardening '' -LRB- Bobbs-MerrUl -RRB- , is a teacher as well as a plant-grower , and his book is intended not only for the general public but for the school-room as well .

		The young folks are appealed to not by means of story but by practical advice in plain and simple language .

		The book is introduced by Professor
Stanley Coulter	PERSON	of
Purdue University	ORGANIZATION	, who emphasizes the value of nature-study in the school-room and the extent to which it may be de - veloped by the practice of window-gardening under the direction of teachers .

		An introductory chapter suggests the probable causes of failure in window - gardening .

		Following this are chapters on con - tainers , describing the advantages and uses of different kinds ; potting and re-potting , and trans - planting from the garden ; soils , their types and conditions , with formulae for their preparation ; watering , the right and wrong ways , and the effects of too much or too little water ; fertilizers and their uses ; light , heat , and ventilation ; insect

		THE DIAL 353 enemies and their destruction ; propagation by seed , and the care of seedlings ; the propagation and care of cuttings ; the use of bulbs for forcing , with advice on the best kinds for this purpose ; foliage plants , including ferns ; and flowering plants .

		As the book is small and the type large , the descriptions and instructions are necessarily brief ; but for this very reason , perhaps , they gain in clearness .

		There is no extraneous matter , and for the inexperienced the little volume will be a real help .

		-- Mr.
Tarkington Baker	PERSON	's volume entitled '' Yard and Garden '' -LRB- Bobbs -
Merrill	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- claims to be '' a book of practical informa - tion for the amateur gardener in city , town , or suburb . ''

		It gives in plain language instructions that should enable the beginner to evolve an attractive garden out of any ground , even an ugly one .

		The author is no Philistine : he does not advise beds of '' bedding-out '' plants on the lawn .

		He is both artistic and sensible : he explains the effectiveness of mass-planting , of hiding the '' bare feet '' of a house , of the beauty of outside planting that is developed inward ; and he cautions the amateur against the aimless curves of paths , against '' splotchiness '' of effect , against trying to do too much at once .

		Indeed , one of his wisest bits of advice is the sug - gestion to begin the garden one year , with the larger and more permanent plantings ; leaving the fiUing-in and foregrounds for successive seasons , when it will be more readily seen just what is needed .

		This is not in opposition to the making of a permanent plan before beginning to plant , the necessity of which is recognized ; but the author holds that in this way the plan can be more effectively carried out , while at the same time modifications that suggest them - selves from time to time can be more easily adopted .

		There are seventeen chapters , covering the various subdivisions of the subject ; and in some of these , as well as in the appendix , there are numerous reference-lists of plants , vines , and shrubs of dif - ferent classes and for varying purposes .

		The ap - pendix also includes outlines of several plans for planting city yards .

		The parks '' ^ ^ ^ multitudinous fascination of and gardens
London	LOCATION	has made a strong appeal of
London	LOCATION	.

		i ^ ^ gjy ^ ^ ^ ^ writers of books .

		We have had accounts of its Bohemian resorts , of its storied Squares , of its '' colour , '' as a young Japanese artist and a clever English essayist , between them , understand it .

		And now comes still another book , on ''
London Parks	LOCATION	and Gardens '' -LRB- Button -RRB- , written by Mrs.
Evelyn Cecil	PERSON	and lavishly illustrated in color and black-and-white by
Lady Victoria Manners	ORGANIZATION	.

		Like everything else about the great city , the parks are imposing in extent and deeply dyed with historical and literary associations .

		Mrs.
Cecil	PERSON	has something to say also about the botanical and decorative features of the parks , and more about their importance as green oases for the rest and recreation of the
London	LOCATION	poor ; but these matters are of far less interest , to American readers at least , than the memories of by - gone days , the bits of ancient gossip , the tales of brilliant assemblies and romantic meetings , that she has gathered .

		She groups the parks in five divi - sions : the
Royal Parks	ORGANIZATION	, which are the largest and most beautiful , though not of the greatest use to the greatest number ; the municipal parks , thoroughly democratic , seldom very decorative , with their in - evitable band-stands , cricket-pitches , playgrounds , and beds of simple hardy flowers by way of orna - ment ; the gardens belonging to institutions , like the
Charterhouse	ORGANIZATION	and the Inns of Court ; the Squares , most of them accessible only to the favored few who live on the streets surrounding them , but enjoyed from outside the railings by the larger public ; and , finally , a few notable private gardens that still sur - vive in spite of the smoke and over-crowding of the city .

		Mrs.
Cecil	PERSON	considers the houses abutting on the Squares as within her province , and surely they are , since the quality of their inmates gave the tone , fashionable or the opposite , to each enclosure .

		She writes at length of the history and development of the parks , -- the purchase of sites , dates of changes and improvements , and other such practical matters .

		The effect of so heterogeneous a mass of informa - tion is somewhat appalling taken en masse , but Mrs.
Cecil	PERSON	's book is meant rather for reference .

		It con - tains everything one could reasonably wish to know on the subject , together with some details that seem unlikely to be of the slightest possible interest to anyone .

Macmiilan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- English shires , jg ^ q \ \ known to lovers of books about rural
England	LOCATION	.

		Like their predecessors , the two latest volumes , dealing respectively with
Kent and Hampshire	PERSON	, are rather appreciations of the regions in all their varied aspects than formal guide - books .

		The text for the volume on Kent is furnished by Mr.
Walter Jerrold	PERSON	, and the illustrations , in even more generous abundance than usual , by Mr.
Hugh Thomson	PERSON	.

		In these latter , Mr.
Thomson	PERSON	, being with - out the collaborator who has aided him in previous volumes of the series , departs from his usual manner and shows himself a delightful landscape artist , with the same appreciation for the essential picturesque - ness of scenery that he has for the essential oddities of humanity .

		There are charming little figures in his landscapes , but they are all subordinated to the general effect .

		-- In the preface to his volume on Hampshire , Mr.
D. H. Moutray	PERSON	Read says : `` Hamp - shire to me is a bundle of memories , all colourful , and few but have a setting of sun-washed landscapes , sweet scents , and bird melodies .

		This is only the said bundle with notes and impressions of many happy days , motoring , driving , cycling , walking , in a country that I love entirely . ''

		Mr.
Read	PERSON	is a keen observer of natural beauties , an industrious recorder of historical and literary associations , and a writer of considerable charm .

		His '' gossip of bygone days and present ways '' in what he considers '' the most 354 THE DIAL , -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, perfect of English counties '' is a book in every way worthy of the series in which it appears .

		Nearly a hundred charming pen-and-ink drawings are con - tributed by Mr.
Arthur B. Connor	PERSON	, and a good map and an index are utef ul features deserving of mention .

		The humors '' ^ ^ ^ arduous a process seems implied and romance in the title of Mrs.
Mary Heaton	PERSON	oi yachting .

		Vorse 's `` The Breaking in of a Yachtsman 's Wife '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It is evidently true , as she says , that she and the breaker-in '' have played the most fascinating of all games , the game of yachting , as seriously as if it were our life-work . ''

		But she soon discovered that no yachtsman believes that any of his fellows can '' tell a canal-boat from a cup-defender , '' so she early took courage -LRB- this was while she was merely a yachts - man 's affianced bride , on the way to promotion -RRB- , and was the rather inducted into the enthusiasm that vivi - fies her work with a sweet reasonableness that quite belies the thought of any `` breaking in . ''

		Her book tells a great deal that one wishei to know about yachts -- enough , let us say , to enable a man insistently resi - dent on the western prairies to write an acceptable sea-story for the magazines ; but it is even more interesting in its mixture of the briny element with the moonlighton-the-water effects of early love .

		A voyager on many seas , and these as various as the differing shores of
Venice	LOCATION	and
Cape Cod	LOCATION	can make them , she and the faithful
Stan	PERSON	, yachtsman-in-chief , were attended by more than one pair of lovers in differing stages of infection .

		All the world loves a lover , of course , though the treatment accorded them here is probably the one that endears them most to the reading public that likes to be amused ; for Mrs.
Vorse	PERSON	's lovers are amusing .

		It is a pleasant book , flavored with more than one kind of salt .

		A beginner 's Twenty years ago Mr.
Garrett	PERSON	P. guide to the
Serviss	PERSON	published his first book on starry sky .

		^ jjg gtarry heavens , entitled ''
Astron	ORGANIZATION	- omy with an Opera-Glass . ''

		His latest book is named '' Astronomy with the Naked Eye '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , and is in the main a g ^ ide to the study of the con - stellations .

		The author devotes his opening chapter to interesting the reader in the beauty of the starry sky .

		He then follows the familiar plan of describ - ing the most conspicuous constellations for each month of the year , in order .

		There are twelve two-page charts of constellations , showing not only the stars but also the mythological figures in light tracings made with orange-colored ink .

		These charts are intended to enable the reader to pick out the stars in each group , and to perceive their relation -LRB- where any exists -RRB- to the mythological figures .

		Mr.
Serviss	PERSON	thereafter devotes his attention to his - torical and descriptive matter about the chief stars in each group , and succeeds in making his theme very interesting .

		Following the constellation chapters are four others , treating respectively of the Milky `` Way , the Zodiacal light , the planets , and the moon .

		A possible improvement on this excellent handbook would be the addition of skeleton maps of the con - stellations , showing only the brighter stars , and connecting them by dotted lines ; these would be of decided assistance to the learner in finding on the face of the sky the marvellous objects which the author has described so well .

		Solitary Nearly twenty years ago Mr.
Charles wanderings M. Doughty	PERSON	's account of his solitary in
Arabia	LOCATION	.

		wanderings through
Central Arabia	ORGANIZATION	was published by the
Cambridge Press	ORGANIZATION	, under the title `` Travels in Arabia Deserta . ''

		The scientific world at once acknowledged its value as an authori - tative answer to many vexed questions of Arabian geography and of the life and history of the desert tribes ; but the great bulk and the costliness of the original edition stood in the way of a general recognition of its extraordinary merits as a literary masterpiece of travel .

		In order that it may be so recognized and enjoyed , Mr.
Edward Garnett	PERSON	has prepared an abridgement of the original narrative , which , extending to a little more than half the orig - inal length , retains the personal chronicle , with its rare charm for the layman , and omits part of the vast store of detailed information on things Arabic , meant especially for the student or the traveller .

		The abridgment is entitled '' Wandering ^ s in
Arabia	LOCATION	, '' and is published in two well-made volumes by the Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	.

		The peculiarity of Mr.
Doughty	PERSON	's Arabian journeyings was that he went fearlessly among the fanatical Arabs , not only not concealing , but actually proclaiming , his race and his faith .

		His style has an oddly archaic flavor , but it is wonder - fully direct and trenchant , in fit correspondence with the incisive quality of his insight .

Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- .

		As the fully descriptive title indicates , the treatment is by families , beginning with such flowers as appear earliest in
spring	DATE	and ending with those that longest defy the frosts of autumn .

		In each case , representative species and genera of each family are selected , generally with reference to the ease with which they may be found ; and as much information is imparted concerning them as will satisfy without surfeiting the curiosity of the average youthful mind .

		Photographs and printed descriptions go as far as possible toward identification without the over-use of technical terms , special attention being paid to times and places ; and the book always keeps in view the giving of practi - cal information , which is admirably blended with literary flavor through apt quotation , largely from contemporary poets .

		Mr.
Stewardson Brown	PERSON	, curator of the herbarium at the

		Species are arranged in accordance with their scientific relationships , and there are keys to the genera , a general key to the families , a glossary , and an index to both common and scientific names .

		Seventy-nine full-page plates , about half of them in color , reproduce more than double that number of species , a great many of which have never been pictured before .

		Both water-color drawings and photographs are the work of Mrs.

		SOME RECENT GUIDE-BOOKS .

		The tourist who is plaiming a few weeks ' or a few months ' trip to
Europe	LOCATION	and means to avoid the vexatious baggage problem by '' travelling light , '' can not do better than fill a corner in his closely packed bag with Dr.
Wilham J. Rolfe	PERSON	's `` Satchel Guide to
Europe	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Hough	PERSON	- ton -RRB- .

		For a brief jotimey , particularly if it be also a first trip abroad , which necessarily keeps pretty closely to the beaten track , this little guide will be found entirely adequate .

		The
1908	DATE	edition , which has recently appeared , brings text and maps up to date .

		An outline of excur - sions in the
Dolomite	LOCATION	district has been added ; also a sketch of a short tour through southern
Spain	LOCATION	.

		It is amazing how much information aboui ; the entire toiu-ist region of
Europe	LOCATION	Dr.
Rolfe	PERSON	has managed to crowd into the compass of a volume a trifle smaller than the average - sized ''
Baedeker	PERSON	. ''

		The Egyptian tourist season extends from
October	DATE	to
May	DATE	.

		Within that time , we are assured by the anony - mous author of the handy little guide ''
Egypt	LOCATION	and How to See It '' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- , one may possibly count ten days , in the worst years , that are not quite perfect .

		The distinctive feature of the new guide is the attractive colored illustrations done by Mr.
A. O. Lamplough	PERSON	.

		The text is written in a style considerably less impersonal than that of the out-and-out guide-book , but it is sys - tematically arranged and there are outlines of tours of various lengths , an English-Arabic vocabulary , lists of hotels and banks , time-tables of the
Egyptian State RaQway	ORGANIZATION	, and much other useful information for trav - ellers .

		And a traveller through
Egypt	LOCATION	everyone who looks at Mr.
Lamplough	PERSON	's pictures will long to become .

		Mr.
Frederick A. Ober	PERSON	's '' Guide to the West Indies '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- includes , besides the matter covered by its title , an account of that more northerly g ^ up of islands , the Bermudas , and a glimpse of
South America	LOCATION	.

		Many illustrations will serve to whet the appetite of the hesi - tating tourist , and the excellent maps will assist him in planning his trip .

		As far as we know , this is the first comprehensive guide to the
West Indies	LOCATION	to be published .

		It describes the attractions , resources , climate , and his - tory of each island , gives a list of hotels and boarding - houses , with prices , and tells how to get to the various groups of islands from the
United States	LOCATION	,
Canada	LOCATION	, or
Europe	LOCATION	.

		A third edition of
Karl Baedeker	PERSON	's '' Handbook for
Spain	LOCATION	and
Portugal	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- contains two additional maps and ten more plans , and brings all the information of the text up to date .

		As the second edition bore date of
1901	DATE	, there has been ample chance for changes , par - ticularly in hotel and railway accommodations .

		Both , we are warned , are still poor , and in the case of hotels a deficiency in the supply for the accommodations of the increasing number of visitors has led to high charges .

		But the tourist who is willing to adapt himself to cir - cumstances can travel through
Spain	LOCATION	comfortably and at a cost not materially different from what he would spend elsewhere in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Measured by standards of duration , absence of violent commotions , maintenance of law and order , general prosperity and contentment of the people , and by the extent of its influence on the institutions and political thought of other lands , the English gov - ernment has been one of the most remarkable the vv ^ orld has ever known .

		No one , least of all any American , can feel that her institutions are foreign to his interest ; yet very few of them are thoroughly understood .

		Those which have been studied most have been considered without regard for proportion , or for their true relation to each other .

		Many of the forces at work have not been described in any treatise .

		They work below the surface and often escape students altogether .

		BRIEFER MENTION 883 NOTES 384 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 385 AN EDUCATIONAL SCANDAL .

		A great deal of education is being scattered about in these bustling days , and few young persons miss a share in the modern dispensation of knowledge .

		The supply is abundant , like that of the manna of fable , and it may seem ungrateful to question the quality of the food thus offered almost for the asking .

		But there are some curious-minded persons who can not help inquiring if the food is really of the most nutritious and health-giving sort , and who can - not help comparing it with that which was dealt out -LRB- with far more sparing hand -RRB- to the youth of a past generation .

		It cost that generation an effort to get educated at all , and commensurate with the degree of the effort was the strength of the determination to get the best education that the accumulated wisdom of the ages could pro- vide .

		Education is now so much a matter of course , and is presented in such a variety of shapes , that we are in danger of forgetting the importance of a wise choice , and of taking with too little deliberation the kind that lies nearest -LRB- ^ o our reach .

		The following instructive story , which we assure our readers is not the invention of a humorist , but the report of an actual occurrence , provides a case in point .

		It was at a gathering of the alumni , old and young , of a famous col - lege .

		One of the older men spoke , and the burden of his discourse was to the effect that in his student days college men took a serious interest in literature and the humanities in gen - eral , an interest which did not seem to be shared with them by the students of the younger gener - ation .

		He said by way of illustration that it was not uncommon for a group of his fellow - students to go out for an afternoon walk , and spend most of their time in talking about
Keats	PERSON	and
Shelley	PERSON	.

		This speaker was followed by a representative of the younger generation -- a graduate in engineering or something of the sort -- who frankly admitted the truth of what had just been said , and added , for his own part , that he had never heard of ''
Sheats	PERSON	and
Kelley	PERSON	. ''

		One can not have much intercourse with the yoimg college graduates of to-day without com - ing to realize that there are many in similar 368 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, case -- many men , that is , who have been sent out into life with the academic stamp upon them , duly documented as educated men , yet lacking in the very elements of an education in any liberal sense .

		They may have the formulas of the electrician upon their tongue 's end , but the simplest allusion to literature finds them blankly unresponsive ; nay , they may even be prepared to settle the business of a new Hoti ^ and yet know nothing of the spiritual message of ^ schylus or of Plato .

		The steadily increasing ignorance , on the part of our young college men , of matters absolutely essential to any kind of education that deserves to be called liberal , is nothing less than an edu - cational scandal .

		Professor
Wilbur L. Cross	PERSON	of
Yale	ORGANIZATION	has just given us a striking illustration of that ignorance in the case of the English Bible . ''

		Not long ago , '' he says , '' to recall an extreme case , not one of forty students under my instruc - tion coidd quite place Judas Iscariot ; and a venerable colleague of mine discovered a Jew among the seniors who had never heard of Moses . ''

		We have had much other testimony to similar effect of late years , and it seems fairly evident that the
Bible	LOCATION	, which is perhaps the greatest single source of liberal culture for English readers , has become a sealed book to a large fraction of the present generation .

		The Greek and Latin classics are in like case , and the best part of English literature is fast grow - ing unintelligible even to those of our young readers who have enjoyed what are euphemisti - cally called educational advantages .

		Upon this point we may quote Professor Grant Showerman of
Wisconsin	LOCATION	, who informs us of students who have told him that '' The Centaurs and ChinMeras were German tribes conquered by
Augustus	PERSON	, called Dolabella the goddess of peace , Aristides the goddess of the ' chace , ' Andro - mache a Greek hero at Troy , Astyanax an island ' some - where in the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	, ' and defined ` Soraotus ' as an intimate friend of
Horace	PERSON	to whom he expounded the carpe diem idea .

		According to one of them , ' Pil - grim 's Progress ' was ' one of the sources of
New England	LOCATION	history . '

		A single set of examination papers yielded the edifying information that
Penelope	PERSON	was the Muse of history , the wife of Achilles , the
Trojan Helen	ORGANIZATION	stolen by
Agamemnon	ORGANIZATION	, the goddess of wine , mirth , and the like , the mother of Proserpine , one of the Muses who presided over lyric poetry , and a kind of wine-jar . ''

		We should be inclined to say that many stu - dents nowadays get from their college life little but educational disadvantages .

		They are advised that '' sociology '' is as good as history , and take to it greedily ; they learn French through the medium of trivial fiction , and never hear of Bossuet and
Racine	LOCATION	; they absorb themselves in science , and get no realizing sense of the exist - ence of such a thing as art .

		It is not alone the classics and the Scriptures that suffer neglect , it is pretty nearly everything that is deeply significant for human culture .

		Just the other day we casually read on one page of a periodical written for educated readers that '' the public will not borrow
Gargantua	LOCATION	's mouth for things of a past generation , '' and on the next page that '' the Republic has no need of chem - ists ; nor , it seems , the Church of scholars . ''

		The two allusions set us to thinking ; for besides their obvious lesson , they put before us the question : How large a percentage of the recent graduates of any of our colleges would be likely to understand them ?

		There is nothing recon - dite about either of them ; yet we have a dark suspicion that neither the name of Rabelais nor that of Lavoisier has any associations at all for the average modern man who has been through the coUege mill and received the acad - emic certification that comes at the end of the course .

		The melancholy exhibits which have just been presented might be multiplied indefinitely -- far beyond the point at which they would still be capable of raising even a smile .

		Where shall the responsibility for them be fixed ?

		We doubt if it is to be fixed at all in any very defi - nite way .

		Certainly it would be unjust to charge it all to the account of the colleges .

		They do about the best they can with the plas - tic material placed in their hands for moulding , and should rest under no severer indictment than that of fostering a confused sense of values , and conducting an educational scheme in which there are far too many loose ends .

		The lower schools come in for some share of the censure , and the parents for some further share .

		But the evil must in large measure be ascribed to the general conditions of American life , to the ideals which are in the air , to the prevailing incentive of commercialism , and to the countless influences that encourage the frivolous disposi - tions of the young and discourage the develop - ment of their serious aptitudes .

		Against the pressure of the spiritually-enervating environ - ment to which our youth is almost everywhere exposed , it is little more than a vain resistance that may be offered by the school or the college .

		The young , man joins in the game , and plays it with zest , but the cards are stacked against him , and he loses steadUy without discovering the reason until it is too late for him to recoup .

		The moral of it all seems to be that our mod - ern society has thought to relieve itself of
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 369 educational responsibility by multiplying the mere machinery of education , forgetting the all-important fact that the ordering of the daily life , most of which is spent perforce outside of academic walls , is the controlling faxitor in the shaping of intellect and character alike .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		Vacation-planning by book and time-table may seem a rather cold-blooded performance , likely to take much of the zest and charm from one 's
summer	DATE	holiday at the very start .

		In vacation time all trammels are irksome -- • at least until one is old enough to have learned that one 's own unregulated impulses and whims are the worst of tyrants .

		At this season of the year many public libraries make a point of placing on open shelves and tables a collection of railway guides , summer-resort booklets , books on camping , canoeing , fishing , and itin - eraries of various kinds , so that their patrons may intel - ligently plan their
summer	DATE	outings .

		The current issue of the '' Bulletin of the Grand Rapids Public Library '' calls attention to its display of such material , and those whose wanderlust is willing to be regulated and controlled will profit by a visit to the library , if it lies within their reach .

		And not only can they learn where to go for their vacation , but also , if they are young enough to be able stiU to profit by such advice , they can learn at the same library where to go to school or college or university when their vacation is over ; for we read in the same issue of the Bulletin that '' the Library has gathered a very large collection of school and college catalogues and other literature which will help to solve this question . ''

		What human needs , we wonder as we read of the manifold activities of the libraries of our broad land , will these beneficent institutions ere long not be able to meet ?

		... Graduate schools for literary workers have been proposed and much written about and talked about of late .

		Foremost among the favorers of such schools is the energetic and enterprising editor of '' The World 's Work , '' who appears to be seriously in earnest in urging that the cause of creative literature can be served by placing our would-be great authors on a bench in a class-room and putting them through a prescribed course of studies and exercises and lectures and examinations .

		But , says one who evidently knows whereof he speaks , those who every year come from the remoter corners of our country to take post-graduate courses in the great universities , ardently seeking after the best that has been thought and said in the world , `` are bidden to provide themselves with an adding machine to count the occurrence of ' fish ' and ' flesh ' in the poetry of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries ; they are asked to hearken to the vowels and consonants singing together through the Dark Ages ; they are invited to embrace the inspiring relics of the Gothic gospels ; they are inducted into the physiology of the vocal organs ; they are set astride an enchanted booomstick and sent chasing Cuchulinn through the Celtic moonshine .

		Seriously , there is nothing more pathetic in the world than the sight of the ardent and aspiring souls from
Utah	LOCATION	,
Oregon	LOCATION	,
Texas	LOCATION	, and the isles of the sea , who come up to the graduate schools , and , in the faith and heart-ravishing impudence of little children asking for bread , receive a gold brick .

		So much for enlarging their acquaintance with great men and great ideas . ''

		Whether a school for authorship , a seminary for literary inspiration , could be planned and conducted with less disappointing results than the graduate courses above referred to , is a ques - tion .

		Perhaps a thoughtful reading of
Stevenson	PERSON	's '' Apology for Idlers '' might help one to an answer .

		Meanwhile , let us ask , can we by any stretch of the imagination think of our great creative authors as hav - ing fitted themselves for their work in a graduate school ?

		Would any number of years in such a school have inspired Poe to write '' The Raven , '' or Whitman '' Leaves of Grass , '' or
Mark Twain	PERSON	'' The Adventures of
Huckleberry Finn	PERSON	, '' or
Bret Harte	PERSON	'' The Luck of Roaring Camp '' ?

		How to express oneself correctly is a matter of elementary education ; but creative authors are bom , not made in graduate schools .

		• • • The function of the literary journal is vari - ously conceived .

		Some think it is to promote the reading of the best that is written in the world to-day ; and others say it is to serve as the busy man 's short-cut to a knowledge of what the teeming presses are produc - ing , and to save him the time and trouble of reading the books themselves .

		A literary journalist 's notion of the matter is well given in a passage from Mr.
Frederic C. Brown	PERSON	's recent address at
Atlantic City	LOCATION	on '' Literary Journalism in Theory and Practice . '' ''

		The literary journal , in a quiet way , '' he believes , '' is influencing the people who think .

		Many centuries ago Plato showed us how , by a process of percolation , profound results of the thinkers ultimately descend upon the non-thinkers .

		Is it not fair to maintain , then , that lacking so much that goes to make up commercial success , the literary journal , by revising and shaping and helpmg the scholas - tic life of
America	LOCATION	, is going a long way toward that intellectualism which is the salvation of any people ?

		Moreover , if the literary journal stand without much financial gain and without blatant success to urge it on a yellow way , and yet manages somehow and somewhere to rebuke the impatience of modern , rushing commer - cialism , is it not , after all , well worth while ? ''

		• • • The evolution of '' The Metropolis '' must be of interest to many out of the thousands now reading and discussing Mr.
Upton Sinclair	PERSON	's latest sensation .

		In an open letter he relates the many opportunities he has had for acquainting himself with the ways of the worshippers of mammon .

		His early associations and later experience seem to have qualified him to make his picture true to life , without resorting to any of the questionable methods that some of his critics have assumed , and without grind - ing his colors in the mill of his own mind , as others have charged him with doing .

		He says , among much else of an autobiographic nature : '' I had , of course , many oppor - tunities of getting into touch with social life in under - ground ways -LSB- some of which are described -RSB- .

		... I chose a much more obvious way of getting my material , so obvious , perhaps , that few would have thought of it .

		I sat down and wrote personal letters to the people I wished to meet .

		I told them frankly just what I intended to do , and I said that I should like to make their acquaint - ance .

		I said that I had talked with many people in get - ting material for my work , and that I had never violated a confidence , nor dropped the remotest hint as to the source of my information .

		I said that I would like to meet them privately and explain my purposes to them .

		370 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, In about three-fourths of the cases the result of this was that I met the person I wanted to meet . ''

		Refuting the charge that his pictures of club life have been taken from the caf ^ s , he says : '' I have lived in
New York City	LOCATION	off and on for eighteen years , and in that time I have been in just exactly one caf ^ .

		I do not know the taste of liquor , and I have never smoked tobacco , nor even drimk a cup of coffee .

		Living as a solitary student and hack-writer in lodging house garrets , I have been in and out and around the Tenderloin a good deal , but I never even realized what it was until a couple of years ago , when I began my study of the life of
New York	LOCATION	... As to the clubs , I have at various times been a guest of the Authors , the Players , the
Century	ORGANIZATION	, the
Union League	ORGANIZATION	, the
Lotos	LOCATION	, and the Metropolitan . ''

		In reply to the charge of having incorporated newspaper yarns in his novel , he admits that '' several of these items were gathered from newspapers , but so far as 95 per cent of the contents of the book is concerned , it has come directly from the lips of persons who themselves have taken part in what they described , and I should say that 60 per cent of it I have seen with my own eyes . ''

		Mr.
Sinclair	PERSON	has even sat down to a '' tospy-turvy limch '' -- not in a
Long Island	LOCATION	road - house , however , but near
New Rochelle	LOCATION	.

		• • • The comparative greatness of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	in tragedy can hardly be discussed without noticing how completely
Goethe	PERSON	was saturated with the works of his predecessor .

		He took lago from one play , and the worst part of Hamlet 's character from another .

		He borrowed Opheha bodily .

		Has it ever been noted how closely
Marguerite	PERSON	follows the pattern of Ophelia ?

		Each is a comparatively humble maiden wooed by a superior .

		There is the possible seduction in
Hamlet	LOCATION	and the certain one in
Faust	LOCATION	.

		Ophelia 's sug - gestive mad-song is echoed in
Faust	LOCATION	.

		The two girls are sisters in modesty , gentleness , and submissive worship of their lovers .

		To both come madness and death .

		Goethe lifted his Witches ' Kitchen from
Macbeth	LOCATION	, and the
Walpurgis Night	ORGANIZATION	is at least suggestive of the
Midsummer Night	ORGANIZATION	's Dream .

		Auerbach 's Cellar is reminiscent of the Boar 's
Head Tavern	LOCATION	,
Eastcheap	LOCATION	; and Dame
Martha	PERSON	might have been studied from Mrs. Quickly or
Juliet	PERSON	's Nurse .

		All this does not exhaust the tale of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's borrowings .

		To
Marlowe	PERSON	he was indebted for the whole idea of his work ; and the first scene of Faust in his study , particularly the opening soliloquy , is full of the English poet .

		The
Helena	ORGANIZATION	theme of the second part also came from him .

		From
Calderon	PERSON	's Magico Prodigioso ,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	absorbed a great deal .

		From the Hindoo drama in general and
Sakun	PERSON	- tala in particular he took the idea of the Theatre Prologue .

		And from the Book of Job he got the Prologue in
Heaven	LOCATION	.

		Truly , a splendid assortment of borrowed trappings .

		Yet the originality of
Faust	ORGANIZATION	is unquestionable , and it holds up its head among its fellows in literature in spite of the fact that it owes something to almost all of them .

		• • • • The '' BiBLioSMiLES , '' a merry offshoot of the serious and dignified
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	, receive a sort of official recognition in the current report of the
Los Angeles	LOCATION	Public Library . ''

		This annual , '' says the librarian .

		Dr.
Charles F. Lummis	PERSON	, '' has none of the exigencies of journalism ; but it would be a pity for it to lose a ' scoop ' ready to its hand -- since no other library report this year will contain the serious information that at the twenty-ninth
Annual Conference of the American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	that grave and reverend body en - joyed an unexpected parthenogenesis -LRB- vide
Isaiah ix.	PERSON	, 6 -RRB- .

		This mild protest against the solemnity into which the profession has fallen -- its tendency to ' forget that we are , after all , mere retailers of Tinned Humanity ... and that the books we pass out belong , after all , to the Public , and not to us ' -- is christened ' the
Bibliosmiles	PERSON	, a rally of Librarians who are
Nevertheless Human	ORGANIZATION	. '

		Its object is ' to keep the bookdiist off our own top shelves . '

		Membership is limited to thirty .

		All the official insignia of fraternalism are provided for .

		There will be annual meetings at the conference of the A. L. A .

		The motto of the order is -LRB- Virgil to date -RRB- `` Homo Sum -- and Then Some . ' ''

		But just why the birth of this interesting off -
spring	DATE	of grave and reverend parentage is called a '' parthenogenesis '' rather than , for example -LRB- if we may coin the word -RRB- , a '' gerontogenesis , '' is somewhat less clear than crystal , even with
Isaiah	PERSON	to sharpen one 's vision .

		.

		* , , This brief span of life seems , by a curious con - tradiction , the briefer the older we grow .

		`` Even at eighty-nine , '' said Mrs.
Julia Ward Howe	PERSON	on her next - to-ninetieth birthday celebration last month , '' individual life is very short .

		We can not do too much in the time we have .

		At my age one spends much time in remin - iscences .

		When I remember the events of fifty and sixty years ago , the cold welcome given those who cham - pioned the cause of anti-slavery and of woman 's suffrage , how they were elbowed out of the way -- when I remember that , and then see these very things adopted in the ordinary programme of progress , I think life is miraculous .

		I have learned that much about it , if nothing else .

		This is a time of great light and progress .

		Things that sixty years ago only philosophers and saints dreamed of , we , who are neither philosophers nor saints , talk about calmly to-day . ''

		This was at a luncheon tendered her by the
New England Woman 's Club	ORGANIZATION	, of which she is president .

		With the eager attention of nineteen rather than eighty-nine , she listened to all the speeches , gayly applauded the witticisms , and acknowl - edged each tribute of praise with a gracious bow .

		Heartily she joined in the singing of ''
Auld Lang Syne	PERSON	, '' and hers was the first voice to start the second stanza .

		Thus she is pictured to us by one who was present .

		Her closing words , which met with emphatic dissent from her assembled friends , were these : '' I take a good bit off the corner of all these fine things I 've heard about myself .

		I 'm sorry to say , ladies and gentlemen , '' shaking her head sadly , `` that I know better . ''

		... Qualifications for successful journalism are acknowledged to be many and varied , but a new one is rather amusingly emphasized in a
Baltimore	LOCATION	editor 's free and easy reply to a
North Carolina	LOCATION	aspirant to journalistic honors . ''

		A good literary style , '' writes the experienced newspaper man , `` is less essential than a good digestion .

		The journalist must be able to digest anything and nothing .

		He must be able to go three days without food ... The accidents and catastrophes which make up the news of the world have no regular office-hours .

		They happen at any old time , day or night .

		When they break loose the journalist must pro- ceed to record them , and he must stick to the task imtil they are recorded .

		As a result he must learn to stretch the hiatus between lunch and dinner until it attains the dignity of a geological epoch . ''

		As to rapidity of
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 371 promotion and the time required for reaching the top of the ladder , this painfully conscientious editor says : `` The question has interested us very much , and we have lain awake several nights figuring upon an answer .

		Working it out carefully after consulting more than 2,000 journalists and with the aid of the table of logarithms , the
United States	LOCATION	census reports for the period 1820-1900 , and all available dream books , we have settled upon 265.7645364827 years .

		We may be wrong about the decimals , but the 265 , we are sure , is reasonably correct . ''

		The higher positions in journalism are well known to be filled by men unreasonably averse to dying or resigning , but their tenacity of office and of life has never been so startlingly revealed as it is by an intelligent study of the foregoing figures .

		• • • The wireless way op typesetting , if what we hear is true , may relieve the present linotype operator of a part of his burden .

		Mr.
Hans Knudsen	PERSON	, the Danish inventor , after achieving fame in liquid air , now proposes to add to his glory by his mastery of the properties of non-liquefied air .

		Or , to be more specific , by means of electric waves generated in the atmosphere by methods known to wireless telegraph experts , he declares himself able to set type in an ordinary linotype machine in
Paris	LOCATION	-LRB- let us say -RRB- , the inventor himself being in
London	LOCATION	. ''

		I shall publicly demonstrate my new wire - less typesetting invention , '' is the
Dane	PERSON	's interesting announcement -LRB- as reported in the press -RRB- , '' within a few weeks .

		I have already had the first machine con - structed , and it proved successful , setting three thou - sand words an hour , at a distance , just as if the operator were working the machine .

		The time is not far distant when , with my invention , the
London	LOCATION	correspondents of the
New York	LOCATION	newspapers will be able to send their news straight to the printing press through the Mar - coni operator . ''

		And perhaps more astonishing still : '' I claim I can send pictures wherever
Marconi	ORGANIZATION	can send messages .

		Within a short time I shall be sending pictures of criminals and finger prints from
England	LOCATION	to
New York	LOCATION	. ''

		Puck 's putting a girdle romid the earth in forty minutes has long since come to be regarded as the work of a bungler ; but now that Mr.
Knudsen	PERSON	is going to put an illustrated newspaper -LRB- will it be illus - trated in colors , we wonder ? -RRB-

		from
London	LOCATION	to
New York	LOCATION	in the twinkling of an eye , poor Puck will wish the fertile brain of his creator had never given him birth .

		• • • Mr.
John Murray	PERSON	and the
London	LOCATION	'' Times '' have been enjoying a little legal tilt in the
King 's Bench Division	ORGANIZATION	of the High Com ^ t of
Justice	ORGANIZATION	, before Mr.
Justice Darling	PERSON	and a special jury , and the publisher has won -LRB- to the extent of #
7500	DATE	damages -RRB- from the newspaper .

		This litigation , which may be regarded as a closing skir - mish in the great '' book war '' whose cannon-thunders have echoed round the world , owes its cause to a

Queen Victoria Letters	ORGANIZATION	.

		The quar - rel is little more edifying than are most libel suits , but its peculiarity and its special significance to both sellers and buyers of books make it deserving of at least a pass - ing note .

		As Mr.
Justice Darling	PERSON	said in his summing up of the evidence , -- `` It is a very unusual action in many respects , particularly becaiise of the parties to it .

		It is not too much to say that The Times and the house of
Murray	PERSON	are practically institutions of the country .

		I can not help feeling that so far from its being an action of a commonplace nature , such as one hears tried every day , it is much as if it were a quarrel between
Magna Charta	ORGANIZATION	and the Bill of Rights . ''

		To a distant and im - partial on-looker , unendowed with legal acumen , the whole affair presents itself in a very plain Ught .

		The
Letters of Queen Victoria	ORGANIZATION	, interesting though they may be to the English public , are not a necessary of life ; and if their authorized publisher chooses to put a handsome price on them , the poor man may regret it , but , not being under the slightest compulsion to buy , it is absurd for him to cry out , as did Artifex , '' Now , sir , these figures ... spell simple extortion . ''

		The figures spell more than most of us like to spend on even a queen 's correspondence ; but to say that our pockets have been wrung is a misuse of language .

		... The function of the library bulletin is well conceived and aptly expressed in the initial number of '' The Library Guide , '' an attractive little periodical issued by the

		Compara - tively few , '' says the editor -LRB- whom we safely assume to be Mr.
James Shaw	PERSON	, the librarian -RRB- , '' know the extent of the riches contained even in a small library .

		A remark we frequently hear is , ' Why , I did not know you had that book in the library . '

		Hundreds of books are on the shelves , equally imknown to the general reader , books possessing vitality and interest , whose pages have power to touch life deeply , to brighten , beautify , and broaden it , to make it more enjoyable as well as more useful . ''

		The aim proposed by the
Aurora	LOCATION	'' Guide '' is to make more widely known , and more often and more intelli - gently read , the books bought and to be bought and undeserving of the dust and repose to which so many accessions are condemned by a too incurious public .

		The explanatory comments sprinkled through the '' List of New Books '' are brief and to the point , and other matter , including a picture of the well-filled Children 's Room , contributes to the interest of this promising publication .

		... The French novel in
France	LOCATION	would almost seem to be in less demand than abroad .

		A
Paris	LOCATION	correspondent of the
New York	LOCATION	'' Evening Post '' finds reason to believe that '' there must be in
France	LOCATION	a relatively larger num - ber of readers of books which are not novels , for cer - tainly the predominance of fiction during the publishing season is not so great in
Paris	LOCATION	as in
London	LOCATION	or
New York	LOCATION	. ''

		It has long been deeply regretted , by those concerned for the fair fame of French writers , that the yellow-covered novel of a certain familiar type shoidd be so much demanded by non-French readers , and that French literature as a whole should be so thoughtlessly and unjustly judged and condemned by alien censors whose knowledge of that literature extends , perhaps , not further than a second-hand impression of the inferior fiction manufactured -LRB- it may be -RRB- for export .

		It is with unusual satisfaction that we note this evidence of library activity in one of our Southern states .

		If in the past less than justice has been done to that part of our broad land , in these occasional comments on library mat - ters , it is pleasant to hail this sympton of a literary re - awakening in the

		A Perfect Woman .

		* A more sympathetic and satisfying portrayal of a beautiful character could not be imagined than Professor
Palmer	PERSON	's '' Life of
Alice Freeman Palmer	PERSON	. ''

		Fifteen years of happy married life , following and continuing a friendship that had ripened during
Alice Freeman	PERSON	's presidency of
Wellesley	LOCATION	, brought the two into so close an intimacy , without naerging their separate individ - ualities , that no better equipped biographer could have been desired for this wonderfully interest - ing and brilliant woman whose untimely death was so great a loss to her countless friends and admirers and to the noble causes she so valiantly championed .

		But though her life was compara - tively short , covering as it did less than half a century , the work of that life can not be said to have been left unfinished at her death .

		So alive was Mrs.
Palmer	PERSON	, while she did live , that her achievement , even when at thirty-two she relin - quished her college presidency , was something astonishing .

		What quality it was in her that made possible so speedy attainment of great ends must remain a mystery ; hers was a nature that had in large proportion the baffling element of genius .

		Her biographer himself says in his Introduction : '' I can not explain it .

		Probably genius is never expli - cable .

		The more nearly it is examined , the more intri - cately marvellous it appears .

		Fifteen years of closest companionship with Mrs.
Palmer	PERSON	did not disclose to me the pulse of that curious machine .

		She always remained a surprise .

		Yet I never tired of studying her ; for though we seldom can fully comprehend a person , in studying one who is great we can push analysis farther than elsewhere and with larger entertainment and pro- fit ; we discover a multitude of ingredients unsuspected at first ; and , most interesting of all , we come upon strange modes of turning trivial things to power and of gaily discarding what men usually count important .

		And even when at last we arrive at what defies analysis , being the very individuality itself , its beautiful mystery still lures us on and -- like
Keats	PERSON	's Grecian Urn -- enlargingly ' teases us out of thought . ' ''

		The rich and beneficent life of this woman falls into four chief divisions , in the biog - rapher 's treatment of it : first , what he calls her family life , from her birth in
1855	DATE	at
Colesvjlle	LOCATION	,
Broome County	LOCATION	,

Windsor Academy	ORGANIZATION	in

Life of Alice Freeman Palmer	ORGANIZATION	.

1902	DATE	.

		These four periods , while not exclu - sive of one another , are dominated each by special interests that are roughly indicated by the four designations chosen by the biographer .

		Externally , the early life is limited by conditions that may be regarded as commonplace enough ; but it is not our opportunities , it is the use we make of them that counts .


Alice Freeman	PERSON	took her life in her own hands , and , with restricted means and a rather frail physique to contend against , shaped it into a thing of beauty and of power .

		Characteristic of her was her early de - termination , in the face of much opposition , to go to college -- in the days when college education for girls was an experiment frowned upon by the majority .

		Her choice of far-away
Ann Arbor	PERSON	, becavise there she could have the same instruc - tion and receive the same degree as male stu - dents , shows the stuff she was made of .

		In this connection her views on co-education are of interest .

		While President
Hall	PERSON	and other educators , are fearing a feminization of schoolboys and coUege youths , and are demand - ing more exclusively male influences both in the teacher 's chair and in the student associates , Mrs.
Palmer	PERSON	continued to the end a firm be - liever in co-education .

		In her opinion , says her husband , the natural association of girls with boys in interests of a noble sort tends to broaden their vision , to solidify their minds , and to remove much that is hectic and unwholesome from the awakening instincts of sex .

		In the words of Professor
Hale	PERSON	of
Chicago	LOCATION	, as quoted by the biographer , '' It was Mrs.
Palmer	PERSON	's con - viction that the normal form of education for both sexes is that in which the natural relations -- begun in the life of the home and the neigh - borhood , continued for the great majority in the life of the school , and inevitably existing in the .

		later social life -- are carried without break through the four years of higher intellectual work .

		She may have been right or she may have been wrong ; but that such a woman , with her personal experience of
Ann Arbor	PERSON	, of
Wellesley	LOCATION	, of
Radcliffe	LOCATION	, and of
Harvard	LOCATION	, should have held this belief is a fact to be reckoned with . ''

		In the things of religion , no less than in those of education , Mrs.
Palmer	PERSON	always thought for her - self .

		H § r faith was of the orthodox complexion , but she held it not as a mere matter of conven - tion , but from personal conviction .

		A paragraph from a college letter to her mother illustrates this side of her character .

		The letter was writ - ten in a moment of considerable perplexity , when lack of money was about to force the writer to discontinue for a while her course at

Ottawa	LOCATION	,
Illinois	LOCATION	.

		This step she took without consulting her parents , though she was not twenty years old at the time . ''

		If you can help me through this year I will try as best I may to take up the paddle and push my own canoe afterwards .

		Whatever comes , dear mother , I know is best for me .

		It is all right .

		Still , I believe God helps only those who help themselves .

		I shall try to do my part , and I fully expect He will do the rest .

		... So I am waiting and trusting and working just as hard as I can while the day lasts .

		Do n't make yourself unhappy nor let any of the rest do so .

		Why should you when He has said , ' Seek first the kingdom of God and all things shall be added . '

		If our Father wants me to go through college , I know I shall go ; and if He does n't , I do n't want to .

		That is the end of it .

		Meanwhile I am planning and thinking .

		If it comes to anything , I will report . ''

		The personal influence -- or magnetism , as some would call it -- of this gifted and forceful woman must be made to explain many of her marveUous achievements .

		When , at the age of twenty-six , she was appointed acting president of
WeUesley College	ORGANIZATION	-- an appointment that led naturally to the presidency in the following year -- she was in doubt whether her young shoulders could bear so heavy a burden .

		Her final action shows her compelling influence on others and her quick resourcefulness .

		The story is best told in the words of the book . ''

		I have ah-eady shown the necessarily disturbed con - dition of the college in these early years .

		There were now fears of trouble from the more than usually ani - mated senior class .

		They had intimations of the election almost as soon as Miss
Freeman	PERSON	learned it herself , and were much elated over the prospect of being ruled by a president but little older than themselves .

		When
Miss Freeman	PERSON	returned to her rooms , she sent for this class .

		They came in a body , filling with their merry presence all her chairs , tables , and floor .

		She told them she had called them together because she needed their advice .

		She had been asked that day to become acting president of
Wellesley	LOCATION	.

		She was too young for the office .

		Indeed , its duties were too heavy for anyone .

		If she must meet them alone , she would have to decUne .

		But it had oc - curred to her that perhaps they would be willing to take part with her , looking after the order of the college them - selves , and leaving her free for general administration .

		If they were ready to imdertake this , she thought she might accept .

		Of course the response was hearty .

		They voted themselves her assistants on the spot , and difficult indeed it was for any member of the three lower classes to stray from the straight path that year . ''

		The various useful activities into which Mrs.
Palmer	PERSON	threw herself after her marriage and her settlement in
Cambridge	LOCATION	-- her service on the
Massachusetts Board of Education	ORGANIZATION	, her presi - dency of the
Woman 's Education Association	ORGANIZATION	, of the
Woman 's Home Missionary Association	ORGANIZATION	, and of other like bodies , her work as non-resident Dean of Women at
Chicago University	ORGANIZATION	, where she contrived to spend a few weeks each year , her part in organizing the great World 's
Colum	PERSON	- bian Exposition , and her share in other works of philanthropy too numerous to mention -- are matters of recent history and need not be dwelt on here .

		As a pleasing picture of her in her happy comradeship with her husband , let us quote a passage referring to their favorite method of touring
Europe	LOCATION	together in the '' sabbatical years '' that gave variety to their iiniversity life . ''

		The sport of bicycling suited Mrs.
Palmer	PERSON	's passion for independence as did little else .

		Ready as her sym - pathies regularly were , she was no less ready , when the burden of the world became oppressive , to throw them all aside .

		Then she would renew herself in utter free - dom and isolation , afterwards coming forth ardently social again .

		In her the child and the responsible woman were ever amusingly combined .

		It was the former that steered when she sat on her bicycle .

		At the call of the white road she felt all ties to be cut .

		The world was all before her where to choose .

		She could turn to the right or left , could feel the down - pressed pedal and the rushing air , could lie in the shade by the roadside , visit a castle , dally long at luncheon , gather grapes or blackberries from the field , stop at whatever small inn might attract at night , and for days together commune rather with nature than with man .

		To preserve the fullest sense of independence , we sent forward no trunk to meet us at appointed spots , but designed a soft bag for the bicycle which would hold supplies for three weeks .

		We made our nights long , beginning to ride about half-past nine in the morning and ending in time for the bath and rest before dinner .

		We rode slowly , avoiding records of more than forty miles a day , and dismoimting at every colorable excuse ; our rule for hills being that wherever a horse should walk , we would . ''

		The letters and unpublished poems of Mrs.
Palmer	PERSON	are drawn upon to complete the picture of her life and mind , her temperament and sympathies .

		A set of verses entitled '' The Butterfly '' -- some of its lines suggestive of
Tennyson	LOCATION	, and perhaps not unworthy of him -- is especially pleasing . ''

		I hold you at last in my hand , Exquisite chUd of the air .

		Can I ever understand How you grew to be so fair ? ''

		You came to my linden tree To taste its delicious sweet , I sitting here in the shadow and shine Playing around my feet . ''

		Now I hold you fast in my hand .

		You marvellous butterfly , Till you help me to understand The eternal mystery . ''

		From that creeping thing in the dust To this shining bliss in the blue !

		God give me courage to trust I can break my chrysalis too ! ''

		That the writer of these verses could have made 374 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, a name for herself in literature , had she so desired , can not be doubted ; but when her hus - band remonstrated with her for building no literary monument to her memory , and added , '' When you are gone people will ask who you were , and nobody will be able to say , '' she replied : '' Well , why should they say ?

		I am trying to make girls wiser and happier .

		Books do n't help much toward that .

		They are enter - taining enough , but really dead things .

		Why should I make more of them ?

		It is people that count .

		You want to put yourself into people ; they touch other people ; these , others still , and so you go on working forever . ''

		So little thirst had she for posthumous fame .

		The chief value to us now of Mrs.
Palmer	PERSON	's life , and of her husband 's record of it , lies in the renewed sense it imparts of the richness and worth of this our mortal existence -- of the end - less opportunities that lie ever open to us if we will but shake off our sloth and our bondage to convention .

		Laziness and conventionality Mrs.
Palmer	PERSON	hated above all else , and she early became convinced that most people are only half - awake .

		In the diffidence and self - searching with which Professor
Palmer	PERSON	has approached the task of preparing a biography , in any degree satis - factory , of his eminently gifted wife , we read at the outset fair promise of success in his difficult undertaking ; and we close the book feeling that no one could better have discharged this debt of love .

		It is a biography of unusual interest just now , and it is safe to predict that it will interest future generations of readers to whom
Alice Freeman Palmer	PERSON	's name may be unknown .

		It has a human appeal and a literary charm and finish that combine to make it almost an ideal book of its kind .


Percy F. Bicknell	PERSON	.

Symbolist Movement	ORGANIZATION	in Literature .

		* '' e/e sais Men que jene puis comprendre -- et cependant je sais quHl faut comprendre ^ Readers of
Maeterlinck	PERSON	will recognize the dazed loving cry of Selysette , who is trying to do her part in a superhuman effort of three characters to convince themselves that the perfect triangle of love may include three right angles ; and this mingling of bewilderment and struggle is not far from the mood begotten in many of us by our first contact with Symbolism .

		We felt that it was an attempt to evade '' the old bond - • The Symbolist Movement in
Literatube	LOCATION	.

		By
Arthur Symons	PERSON	.

		New York :
E. P. Button & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		age of rhetoric , the old bondage of exteriority , '' to substitute the language of the spirit for the language of the flesh ; that it was a call to the soul long starved on the husks of mat -LRB- -RCB- rialism or confined in the mud-walled prisons of extreme realism ; that it was a recognition of mystery and a yearning for the infinite .

		It was there - fore our duty to understand .

		But what did it all mean ?

		Blind faces huddled together and half seen through grudging windows ; a child weeping in a lonely tower on a dreary strand ; a sister sobbing with arms outstretched toward a relentless door , while her idolized brother is pitilessly done to death beyond the wall at the behest of a mysterious queen , -- all of these appeals stirred our emotions , but not seldom each of us read a different meaning in the sym - bol .

		Howbeit , when we grew fainthearted we remembered that after all Symbolism was a phase , an expression , of Mysticism , and that all lofty imaginations were marked by a mystic element .

		Our memories drifted back to the heaven-scaling myths of Plato ; and we recalled the teachings of
Emerson	LOCATION	, with his reiterated admonitions against literalism and earthliness .

		Even the cold scientific voice of Pasteur rang in our ears : '' How wretched are they who have only clear ideas ! ''

		Ever we felt that we might be holding in our hands a golden key to a glorious treasure ; and ever we feared that the fault must lie within ourselves .

		But now we may quote
Aglavaine	ORGANIZATION	's suggestive avowal that '' there is nothing more beautiful than a key , as long as we do not know what it opens , '' and we are no longer quite so prone to blame ourselves .

		Nay , we have lived to be able to write down these words from the lips of
Maeterlinck	PERSON	the essayist , who is constantly needed as a commentator on
Maeterlinck	PERSON	the dramatist . ''

		Is the poet 's duty not rather to furnish an explana - tion loftier , clearer , more widely and profoundly human than any his reader can find for himself ?

		It is time that the poet should realize that the symbol is legitimate only when it stands for accepted truth , or for truth which as yet we can not or will not accept ; but the symbol is out of place at a time when it is truth itself that we seek .

		And besides , to merit admission into a really living poem , the symbol should be at least as great and beautifid as the truth for which it stands , and should , moreover , precede tl \ is truth , and not follow a long way behind . ''

		With some such concession it becomes possi - ble to assign Symbolism its legitimate field and function .

		For the majority of us , life is made up of the day 's work in some form or other , of trivial pleasures and ordinary pains , and finally of our closer association with the mystery of things .

		The three divisions naturally vary as to relative
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 375 importance with almost every individual , even as they vary from time to time in the individual himself .

		Naturally , too , they interact and are not ultimately separable .

		Roughly speaking , however , the partition is valid , despite the myste - riousness of the commonplace and the occasional commonplaceness of what seems the supreme mystery .

		Even the most ordinary of us come at times very close to the final heights and depths , to heaven or hell .

		We rise for a moment to the level of the love of the woman who loves us ; we rebel with all frustrated spirits when we are torn from her and our dream .

		Or , in the brood - ing stillness of some four walls that shut us from the world , we seem to be borne out on the un - fathomable flow of time to eternity , untU we reach the realm where nothing is felt and noth - ing is real save the pidsations of the universe , with which the throbbings of our own heart are at one .

		In such a moment some of us are prone to feel that the mystery is solved , because we have realized that we are a part thereof ; and a deep joy is shed over our being .

		But to others of us the mystery appears only more transcend - ental , more baffling , more -LRB- let us be honest in our heart of hearts -RRB- more bitter .

		The music of the spheres to you may be a moan of pain to me .

		Howbeit , the true mystic , whether finding joy or pain , concludes that mystery is alike the final reality and the only clarity ; and it is a nat - ural step to conclude that only by myth and sym - bol can soul speak to soul .

		Le style de Vecole c'est la philosophie de Vecole .

		But herewith arises the old , old danger of emphasizing a part until it becomes more than the whole ; and only the supreme leader is safe .

		The greatest writer is he who compasses alike the day 's work with - out being filled by its soul-choking dust ; the trivial pains and pleasures , without being lulled in their benumbing circle ; and the highest mysteries , without losing himself in mysticism or ecstasy .

		To teach us about these things , he will command every possibility of the world of the word .

		Symbolism will be a noble minister of his will .

		But he will use it as
Plato	ORGANIZATION	used it , or
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, or Shakespeare ; and in his loftiest soaring he will never quite lose from sight the every-day world beneath ; the winged steeds of his imagination will never quite escape the masterfid rein .

		He will praise silence , as
Carlyle	LOCATION	or
Emerson	PERSON	praised it ; but he will speak to us by his word as well as by his reti - cence , and will remember that Symbolism is an approximation to the mysterious language of silence .

		Never will he make the symbol greater than what is symbolized , nor will he always disdain ordinary channels of communication in favor of the soul-message of figure and metaphor .

		Herewith , if a little presumption be allowed us , we may hope that we have touched upon some of the straying tendencies of the modem Symbolist movement as seen in French litera - ture during the last half-century .

		It is dis - tinctly a revolt against Materialism ; but its advocates must not insist that no other form of revolt can be beautiful and fruitful .

		In a prac - tical age , it dwells laudably on the importance of being and becoming as opposed to doing ; and yet we can not accept quite fully '' the infinite insignificance of action . ''

		Again , be - cause every great writer has elements of mysti - cism in him , and uses myth or symbol when he will , it is hardly fair to conclude that conscious and exclusive Symbolism should be made the whole of literature , or even that it represents the only line of advance from the present stage .

		Silence , if we care to be concessively esoteric , may be the most eloquent language of the soul , and the symbol may be nearer silence than the spoken word ; but it does not follow that a writer can be most effective by using only silences and symbols .

		Even between two souls in perfect communion -- to take the ex - ample to which the Symbolists themselves con - stantly recur -- the ideal lover and the ideal beloved , life could not be always an unbroken silence or its language limited to a caress .

		To make literature untempered Symbolism , the deliberate Symbolism that shall be the whole work and not the great moment therein , is equivalent to asking us to live always either in blinding light or depressing gloom . '

		• ' ■ A chacun son infini '' proclaims Villiers de L'Isle-Adam ; and we glady acquiesce .

		But for most of us , our infinity must still remember the day 's work and the lowly duties ; and literature must follow the steps of life or lose its only path to the heights .

		In so far as Symbolism brings us to a healthful and inspiring appreciation of '' the prophets who have redeemed the world , the artists who have made the world beautiful , and the lovers who have quickened the pulses of the world , '' in so far as it helps us to live at our finest intensity morally and aesthetically , we must heed its voice and acclaim its service .

		But withal it must come for judgment to the bar of life , where so many movements find pitiless arbitrament .

		In any event , whatever be our attitude to the movement , we must find its history keenly in - teresting ; and when the account thereof comes from the glowing pen of Mr.
Arthur Symons	PERSON	376 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	> the interest will for many be quickened into delight .

		One may quarrel with this frankly partisan historian at whatever turn one will ; but his book remains exceptionally attractive and enlightening .

		He has wisely chosen to fol - low the development of the principle in
France	LOCATION	, '' the country of movements , '' although he sees it spreading over all
Europe	LOCATION	as the one quick - ening impulse in literature .

		As a result of this deliberate limitation , he is able to give a con - nected and not inadequate treatment of the development of Symbolism in the hands of a strangely diverse group of men .

		There could hardly be a more enlightening comment on the potential inclusiveness of the movement than the depiction of its outworking in the actual instances he has selected .

		The mad and dream - ing
Gerard de Nerval	ORGANIZATION	, the proud aristocratic Villiers , the restless poet-trader-explorer Rim - baud , the sensual religious
Verlaine	PERSON	, the gentle aspiring
Maeterlinck	PERSON	, and the rest , -- where could one find such representatives of another literary movement ?

		Where could one find another movement that shoidd allow their kin - ship with all their divergence ?

		Mr.
Symons	PERSON	's introductory chapter is a bril - liantly clever attempt to identify the new Symbolist movement with the fundamental sym - bolism that has played so large a part in human development . ''

		Symbolism began with the first words uttered by the first man , as he named every living thing ; or before then , in heaven , when God named the world into being . ''

		A little later , we find interwoven
Carlyle	PERSON	's unfor - gettable vindication : `` In the symbol proper , what we can call a symbol , there is ever more or less distinctly and directly some embodiment and revelation of the Infinite , the Infinite is made to blend itself with the
Finite	ORGANIZATION	, to stand visible , and as it were attainable there . ''

		Thus our guide leads us skilfully up to the logical obstacles of our colder moods , and winningly persuades us they are not there , until we are almost ready to admit that in Symbolism we have set our feet upon '' the one pathway lead - ing through beautiful things to eternal beauty , '' and enabling literature '' to come closer to humanity , to everything in humanity that may have begun before the world and may outlast it . ''

		If we coidd read only Mr.
Symons	PERSON	and not some of the Symbolist literature itself , we might believe that herein art and conduct and the dream are at last brought into a glorious harmony that at once simplifies and beautifies these three elements of life which often appear so dissonant .

		From his glowing tribute it is hard to return to the thought that Symbolism too must have its frailties ; that it , like all other work of man 's hand , will show inequalities of craftsmanship ; that the lives of its votaries have frequently been far from indicating its saving grace ; that the mystagogue has some - times been hard to distinguish from the char - latan .

		Mr.
Symons	PERSON	himself is prompt to recognize that much of the output of the repre - sentatives of Symbolism has served no tangible purpose ; but nevertheless his pages glow with hope and faith .

		Always , as you read , you wish you could see with his eyes .

		The beginning of the movement our histo - rian traces to
Gerard de Nerval	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- 1808-1855 -RRB- , although with him Symbolism was still com - paratively unconscious .

		In this pathetic figure any student of human nature must find grim food for thought .

		Living the transfigured life of the dreamer , but sinking often to the most flagrant bestiality , he wrote between intervals of madness , or even during the very onslaughts of his malady .

		It is easy to be impatient with his vagaries when he is sane ; but it is almost impossible not to weep over the waking dreams of his madness .

		It was with strange appropri - ateness that his insanity declared itself by his leading a lobster into the Palais Royal at the end of a blue ribbon . ''

		-LRB- ' Because , ' he said , ' it does not bark , and knows the secrets of the sea . ' -RRB- ''

		But we must not mar for our readers the picture drawn by Mr.
Symons	PERSON	of this incredible writer , '' graceful and elegant when he is sane ; but only inspired , only really wise , passionate , collected , only reaUy master of him - self , when he is insane . ''

		We are bovmd , how - ever , to transcribe the estimate given as to his place in the movement we are discussing . ''


Gerard de Nerval	ORGANIZATION	, then , had divined , before all the world , that poetry should be a miracle ; not a hymn to beauty , nor the description of beauty , nor beauty 's mirror ; but beauty itself , the colour , fragrance and form of the imagined flower , as it blossoms again out of the page .

		Vision , the over-powering vision , had come to him beyond , if not against , his will ; and he knew that vision is the root out of which the flower must grow .

		Vision had taught him symbol , and he knew that it is by symbol alone that the flower can take vis - ible form .

		He knew that the whole mystery of beauty can never be comprehended by the crowd , and that while clearness is a virtue of style , perfect explicitness is not a necessary virtue . ''

		Here , if we follow Mr.
Symons	PERSON	, begins the lit - erature '' in which the visible world is no longer a reality , and the unseen world no longer a dream . ''

		With de Nerval arises that use of words '' which create an atmosphere by the actual quality of their syllables , as , according to
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 377 the theory of Mallarme , they should do , as in the recent attempts of the Symbolists , writer after writer has endeavored to lure them into doing . ''

		To him we may trace that striving for the perfection of form that shall annihilate form .

		In his lyrics we hear the preliminary notes that foretell the '' art of
Verlaine	PERSON	in bringing verse to a bird 's song , the art of Mallarme in bringing verse to the song of an orchestra . ''

		In his dramatic writing , the stage is prepared for Villiers to make drama '' the iembodiment of spiritual forces , `` for
Maeterlinck	PERSON	to make it '' not even their embodiment , but the remote sound of their voices . ''

		We may only tarry long enough to query whether it is quite certain that verse should be brought to the song of a bird or an orchestra ; whether it is not possible that the bird and the orchestra are doing their parts fairly well , and that verse has a function of its own ; and whether the drama is reaUy at its highest when it becomes only the remote sound of the voices of spiritual forces , as in some of the famous '' marionette '' plays .

		In any event , de Nerval seems to have made ready the mystic way to these mystic extremes .

		With ViUiers -LRB- 1838-1889 -RRB- , `` the
Don Quixote	PERSON	of Idealism , '' we come to the conscious stage of the movement , with which most of us are more familiar .

		In addition to authors mentioned elsewhere in the course of this notice , Mr.
Symons	PERSON	treats
Jules Laforgue	PERSON	,
Stephane Mallarme	PERSON	, and '' the later ''
Huysmans	PERSON	.

		With reference to the last named , '' who began by acquiring so aston - ishing a mastery of description that he could describe the inside of a cow hanging in a butcher 's shop as beautifully as if it were a casket of jewels , '' we should like to enter upon a controversy ; but already we have gone beyond our allotted space .

		It is safe to say that almost every reader will share the reviewer 's desire to fight it out on many points ; it is equally safe to say that those who quarrel most will not enjoy the book least .

		We have enjoyed it thoroughly , finding it stimu - lating and valuable .

		Our pleasure was greatly heightened by the style , which is worthy of the spirit wherewith Mr.
Symons	PERSON	approached his subject ; and that is saying much .

		We should point out , in conclusion , that the volume must be taken for what it is .

		It con - tains no systematic attempt to connect the modem Symbolist movement in literature with the great mystics of other centuries or other spheres .

		Upon the relations between mysticism and race-heredity it does not even touch , although the problem is fundamental .

		In short , we have before us not a searching philosophical treatise , but a delightful bit of literary history and aesthetic appreciation .

		A few pages of welcome '' Bibliography and Notes '' are appended .

		In the dedication to Mr.
W. B. Yeats	PERSON	, and in a list of '' works by the same author , '' we are reminded that the original English edition appeared in

		The EvoiiUTioN of Religious Thought .

		* A consideration of the personality of Dr.
Hoffman	PERSON	, author of '' The Sphere of Religion , '' and of the institutions which he represents , reveals a striking perspective .

		As compared with his predecessor in the true apostolic -LRB- i.e. , missionary -RRB- succession , he presents a notable example of progress .

		No deeper or more inter - esting change in men 's religious thought , belief , and life was probably ever wrought than that which has sQently taken place within the
last three decades	DATE	.

		The Protestant Reformation , linked as it was with politics , economics , new trade routes , the rise and fall of governments , and the sweeping away of the survivals of feudal - ism , was vastly more violent .

		The more modern change has been as the coming of morning light -- evolution without revolution .

		At
Schenec	PERSON	- tady , until the hour of his death in
May , 1877	DATE	, Professor
Tayler Lewis	PERSON	, past-master of Hebrew and seventeenth-century orthodoxy , contended valiantly for those notions of religion then thought mighty to save , but which are now , without observation , melting into the infinite azure .

		In this year of grace behold a feUow , elder in the same noble old Reformed Church in the same city .

		Professor
Lewis	PERSON	's successor in the professorial chair at
Union College	ORGANIZATION	, preach - ing that '' man 's religion develops as he himself develops . ''

		Axiomatic indeed , but hardly ac - cording to
Dort	PERSON	.

		Again he writes : '' Even if we allow that every word in Scripture came directly from the lips of the Almighty , no man could ever be more than probably certain that he correctly heard the words when they were uttered , or correctly wrote them down , or correctly understood them after they were written , either by themselves or in their mutual relations ... All that the profoundest thinker can do for them is to establish their probable truthfulness . ''

		This is the author 's comment on the Apostles ' creed , traditionally so called ; but it applies , he tells us , '' with equal force , to every creed in * The Sphere of Beligion .

June 16	DATE	,
Christendom	LOCATION	and to every system of theology .

		... Those who teach them are never justified in urging their acceptance upon others on any other ground . ''

		Golden words from a repre - sentative of that
Church	ORGANIZATION	which had , on Manhat - tan in
1628	DATE	, the first fuUy organized Protestant church on this continent , and which carries as historic impedimenta an enormous bulk of '' bal - ance of probabilities '' inherited from
Athanasius	LOCATION	and of mediaeval tradition from the apostles ,
Guido de Bres	PERSON	,
Ursinus	LOCATION	, and the theologians of the
State Church	ORGANIZATION	at
Dordrecht	LOCATION	.

		Yet these wise and sane words of Dr.
Hoffman	PERSON	will be acceptable to all churches .

		Let one read his thirteen analyses and digests of the sacred books of
Babylon	LOCATION	,
Egypt	LOCATION	,
India	LOCATION	, and
China	LOCATION	; of Jewish ,
Buddhist	LOCATION	, and Christian literature ; of the teach - ings of Mohammed ,
Joseph Smith	PERSON	, Mrs.
Eddy	PERSON	, and
Madame Blavatsky	PERSON	, and judge whether this man is not of the spirit of him who said , `` Other sheep have I , which are not of this fold . ''

		On his title-page he writes , '' Truth , by whomsoever uttered , is from God . ''

		Could any sentiment be more truly Christian in spirit !

		This is a book that may best be judged by quotations .

		Thus its power is manifest .

		Dr.
Hoffman	PERSON	asks that '' Every student of theology take up the subject pre - cisely as he would every other science ... We believe that even the teachings of Jesus should be ... accepted or rejected on the ground of their inherent reason - ableness . '' ''

		The view of today is that we get our ideas of God from what we know of the universe about us and from what we know about ourselves . '' ''

		God is all the time incarnating himself in human history .

		We can not set any limits to his incarnation in the future . ''

		In other words , what is in one century the artil - lery of the church becomes its baggage in the next .

		The '' sphere of religion , '' then , is like the sphere of the air : it is all around us and we are in it .

		Thus in fewer than four hundred pages Dr.
Hoffman	PERSON	shows his conception of the nature of religion and its influence on civilization .

		. ''

		Religion is the key to history . ''

		Crystal clear is the whole of this eminently sane and practical discussion .

		Even '' the man in the street '' wiU want to finish the book .

		That it will be widely read is certain .

		Issuing from a thinker who is prominently identified with one of the most con - servative churches of honorable history , notable for its sanity and power , its simplicity , direct - ness , and grasp , the book is a landmark in the history of religious thought .

		Two
New Studies of Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	.

		* When the sixth centenary of
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	was celebrated ,
three years ago	DATE	, there were pub - lished a few noteworthy books -- translations of his sonnets and interpretations of his life and work as one of the major apostles of the Renaissance .

		Since this impetus the interest has increased ; readers of all nationalities , who seek inspiration and delight from pure litera - ture , have responded to the products of this poet and humanist , and also have found pleas - lu-e in the biographical studies by his devotees of earlier as well as more recent years .

		Two notable contributions of the current season re - present an aftermath of research and inter - pretation , proclaiming the personal traits of
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	, his literary purposes , and his rank as adjudged by modem scholars .

		The brief study , ''
Petrarch	PERSON	and the Ancient World , '' by
M. de Nolhac	PERSON	, curator of the Palace of
Versailles	LOCATION	, is an expansion of an address delivered by the author in this country ' , and now issued as a volume in '' The Humanists ' Library '' from the
Merrymount Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is fitting that one who cherished and collected classic writings in their simple and beautiful forms should have been thus honored by Mr.
Updike	PERSON	in one of his finest examples of book - making .

		The aim of this study is definite , -- a recognition of
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	's work as scholar and humanist-poet '' who revived once more the worship of the Ancient World . ''

		In accom - plishing this work for literature ,
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	brought a mind of marked poetic sensibility to the study of the great masters of the clas - sics , especially Virgil and
Cicero	PERSON	.

		With scorn and keen raillery for all false science of his day , with a sharp tongue and pen against all charlatans ,
Petrarch	PERSON	was sometimes guilty of too great indifference towards contemporary methods and leaders .

		Archaeology and his - tory , especially from the perspective of the moralist , appealed to him both as a scholar and a poet . ''

		Petrarch dreamed as a poet , and wrote as a poet , even when he believed his mission to be the restoration and reproduction in his own books of the knowledge of the an - cients ; and that alone was enough to keep him from being a pedant , even when he paid the highest homage to pedantry . ''

		An interesting and valuable portion of this book is devoted to
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	's library and its gradual acquisition * Petrarch and the Ancient World .

1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 379 through personal quests and the aid of friends in many countries .

		With due emphasis the author recounts
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	's services to literature through the discovery and preservation , with the aid of trained copyists under his direction , of certain letters and discourses of
Cicero	LOCATION	.

		The second of our two biographical and critical studies is more detailed and ambitious .

		It is excellent in its revealment of
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	's temperament , of the vital influences of his en - vironment and friendships , and of the pictorial story , of his daily life at
Vaucluse	LOCATION	in activity as host and in literary retirement .

		The author , Mr.
Hollway-Calthrop	PERSON	, is discriminating and conservative in his treatment of the various aspects of the poet 's life .

		Acknowledging his obligations to earlier biographers -- notably de Sade ,
Baldelli	PERSON	,
Fracassetti	PERSON	, and
Koerting	PERSON	-- he casts aside some of the romantic suppositions indulged by other biographers , and frankly per - mits the reader either to imagine or to leave in mystery the identity of the poet 's mistress and the intimate details of
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	's relations with her .

		He says : `` Who was Laura ?

		Frankly , we do not know .

		In all probability Petrarch purposely destroyed all marks of identification ; if this was his intention , his success was complete , and the riddle will prob - ably never be answered with certainty . ''

		That
Laura	PERSON	was only an allegorical term , however , as some would surmise , the author of this study refuses to believe , in face of the CAddence from
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	's letters , and his notes in the Virgil which was his constant companion and is now preserved in the Ambrosian Library at
Milan	LOCATION	.

		Much effort has been made to show that
Laura	PERSON	was the wife of Count Hugo de Sade ; but such a claim rests largely on surmises and ingenious if not forced interpretations .

		Yet if the identity of
Laura	LOCATION	is hidden in secrecy , the author doubts not that she '' was a real woman , and
Petrarch	PERSON	was desperately her lover . ''

		Moreover , her influence was paramount in unfolding his emo - tional and poetic nature , in raising his standards of thought and piety until he confessed in his '' Secretum , '' '' Through love of her I attained to love of God .

		It was she who reclaimed my youthful spirit from all baseness . ''

		Intellect - ually , the youth became a man under the influence of this passion , and the immature verses of '' Juvenalia '' were destroyed by him as insincere and unworthy , while the '' Can - zoniere , '' written under the stimulus of this love and its memory , have given Petrarch an unques - tioned place among the world 's masters of love - songs and sonnets .

		Among the earlier influences upon
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	, as emphasized by this biographer , was the en - vironment of his childhood home on the Tuscan estate at
Incisa	LOCATION	.

		Although
Arezzo	LOCATION	chanced to be his birthplace , he passed there only a few months of babyhood , while the first seven years of an impressionable boyhood were spent amid the beauties and melodies of
Tuscany	LOCATION	.

		Bologna ,
Genoa	LOCATION	,
Florence	LOCATION	,
Rome	LOCATION	, and other places of historical and romantic associations , played their parts in his mental and poetic growth .

		Two influences which contributed largely to his happiness and temperamental development were his travels and his friends .

		He was , in truth , '' always a wanderer , '' yet he was also at times a hermit , a lover of the country , an earnest student , and a poet with such fixed and exalted aspirations that he well merited the '' Crown of Song '' bestowed by the hands of
King Robert of Sicily	ORGANIZATION	.

		The friends of Petrarch were many and of varied types -- popes and cardinals , statesmen and political intriguers , men of erudition and women of sensuous charm .

		In his friendship alike with Cardinal
Colonna	PERSON	and
Rienzi	PERSON	he proved a fervid politician and a wise counsellor .

		Of all his friendships , that with
Boccaccio	PERSON	has the greatest interest to literary students , and the younger man owed much of his development as poet to the cordial and stimulating friend - ship of Petrarch .

		The two men were supple - mentary in their mental qualities , as Mr.
Hollway-Calthrop	PERSON	has thus indicated : '' The life of neither could be reckoned complete till he had found his fellow .

		Petrarch had an anxious spirit ; under every rose he looked for the thorn , and if he failed to find it he vexed his soul with questioning whether it ought not to have pricked him .

		Boccaccio plucked the flower and wore it with a gay assurance that took no note of thorn-pricks ... They were alike in their enthusiasm for learning and in their indefati - gable industry , but they were alike in hardly anything else .

		Petrarch was incomparably the riper scholar , the sounder critic ; he had a more reasoned judgment , a more cultivated taste ;
Boccaccio	PERSON	had the more fertile imagination , the brighter wit .

		Petrarch was lucid in argument , but apt to be prolix in narrative ;
Boccaccio	PERSON	showed little talent ^ or disquisition , but his was the story-teller 's inimitable gift . ''

		By liberal quotations from
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	's letters , and through the testimony of friends , the biog - rapher gives a vivid impression of the life at
Vaucluse	LOCATION	, and of the lovable and regrettable traits of the poet .

		He acknowledges frankly the errancy of
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	's disposition in dealing with
Giovanni	PERSON	, his illegitimate and stubborn son whose perverseness and idleness increased rather than lessened under the rigorous and anxious 380 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, training of the father .

		Attention is given to
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	's poem ''
Africa	LOCATION	, '' which , although a failure artistically , is of value historically in tracing the revival of learning .

		Historical stu - dents are indebted also to his '' Lives of Illus - trious Men , '' consisting of thirty-one biographies , nearly one-half of the volume of seven hundred and fifty pages being devoted to the life of
Caesar	LOCATION	.

		While this study of
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	is essentially a personal revelation of the man in the midst of political and literary associates , and in happy retirement among his books and gardens at Vau - cluse , there are some forceful sentences of criti - cal analysis upon his place as poet and humanist .

		With characteristic caution , the true meaning of his mission is thus stated : `` When , therefore , we say that
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	founded Humanism and inaugurated the New Learning , we do not mean that he created sonaething out of nothing ; we mean that he inspired ideas and modes of thought , which preceding scholars had possessed in their own brains , but could not commimicate to society at large . ''

		In actual scholarship , and in Latin compositions ,
Petrarch	PERSON	was inferior to some of his contempo - raries and successors who are more directly con - nected with the Renaissance movement .

		He sought not merely to revive study of the classics but '' to bring the world back to the mental standpoint of the classical writers . ''

		The lover of
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	will rejoice in this latest sympathetic revelation of his personality , and the reader who first seeks acquaintance with the poet will find here a discriminating yet enthusiastic guide who has made good use of the material already pub - lished and added several unfamiliar extracts from
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	's frank and charming letters .

Henry Dwight Sedgwick	PERSON	's collected literature .

		pieces , `` The New American Type , and Other Essays '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , one 's attention is pleasantly arrested .

		The dedication , '' To
S. S. M.	PERSON	,
Amicse Mirabili	PERSON	,
Matri Admirabili	ORGANIZATION	,
Socrui Incom	LOCATION	- parabili , '' with its cumulative praise expressed in three successive adjectives in - bilis , each stronger than the preceding , is such a tribute to a mother-in - law as is not often met with in this naughty world -- in books at least .

		The '' new American type '' is the nervous , unreposeful type portrayed by Mr.
Sargent	PERSON	, Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	, Mr.
Alexander	PERSON	, and other modern painters of American portraits , as contrasted with the self-satisfied , self-contained type seen in the canvases of Stuart and
Copley	ORGANIZATION	.

		The essay was in - spired by a stroll through a picture gallery .

		The second paper treats of '' The Mob Spu-it in Litera - ture , '' and divides the reading mob into the prole - tarian or dime-novel-reading section , the lower bourgeois section , which is addicted to
Albert Ross	PERSON	,
E. P. Roe	PERSON	, and the like , and the upper bourgeois section , which reads such popular novelists as Win -
ston Churchill	LOCATION	,
Charles Major	PERSON	,
Thomas Dixon	PERSON	, Jr. , and HalHe
Erminie Rives	PERSON	.

		This mob spirit is not admirable , and in Mr.
Sedgwick	PERSON	's opinion , '' if there were critics , men of natural gifts and educated taste , experienced in the humanities , there would be no mob ; for the condition of headlessness , of ungnided - ness , is essential to a mob .

		But there are no Amer - ican critics , except Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	, who confines himself to a consideration of foreigners . ''

		Rather severe , this , on American literary criticism , or what passes as such .

		Moreover , even in
Europe	LOCATION	, in
England	LOCATION	and in
France	LOCATION	, where it seems to be ad - mitted that there are literary critics , the craze for the latest literary sensation is hardly less unrestrained than with us .

		In the third essay , on Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	, the author does her scant justice in denying her almost every excellence but '' cleverness . ''

		To him she is one who makes an effective display of what has been studied up in books and museums and pic - ture galleries , while on the deeper things of life she has little hold .

		Surely there are passages even in her brilliantly successful '' House of Mirth '' that show a moi'e than superficial acquaintance with stern realities .

		Other chapters , on educational , social , and bookish themes , follow ; and the book closes with an ingenious political forecast entitled `` The Coup d'Etat of
1961	DATE	. ''

		The writer 's ideals are high , and his style that of a critic '' of natural gifts and edu - cated taste , experienced in the humanities '' -- even though he does deny the existence among us of any such guides in the things of literature .

		Followers of the fortunes of the and ^ helook .

		American drama will note with in - terest the appearance in book form of Mr.
Percy Mackaye	PERSON	's new play , '' The Scare - crow '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		We do not suppose it can be called a closet ^ drama , for it is undoubtedly meant for the stage ; and yet we can not speak of it as one sees it on the stage , for we do not even know whether it has ever been acted .

		Considering the book thus -- with a thought of the stage , but still as a book -- we find a good deal of interest in it , but not quite as much as we should like .

		A play , to be really successful , should , to our mind , have some import or significance in its idea .

		We do not mean that it should necessarily be a miracle-play , or a problem-play , or a symbolic-play ; but it ought to have a subject that really interests people .

		And this * ' The Scarecrow '' has .

		The conception of Ravensbane as the incongruity between our real souls and our lofty pretensions or ideals , -- that is something that is worth while .

		If it be well done , people will be interested .

		In another quality of the drama -- namely , the being something that can

		THE DIAI .

		381 be readily seen , that shall present its meaning strongly in terms of sight , -- in this also Mr.
Mackaye	PERSON	is successful , especially in Act I. And as to structure , another dramatic necessity , the play has a plot .

		If , then , we find the piece to have these three excellent possibilities , of significance , scenic capacity , and construction , what does it lack ?

		We think it lacks coherence .

		The story of the play that is developed in the plot does not appear to us to have the same significance as the character of Ravensbane , as the general idea of the play .

		The two things distract our thoughts instead of intensi - fying the impression .

		And although if the play were presented we should doubtless be interested in what we saw , yet we do not readily imagine any definite situation , figure , or scene , that seems typi - cal of the one thing the author had it at heart to impress .

		So it is possible that the play would not have been entirely appreciated without the explana - tion of the preface .

		But of course a dramatist will want his work to impress itself without the help of comment .

		Tiie battle of ^ ^ ^ Massachusetts Commandery of Oetty '' burg , by the Military Order of the Loyal an eye-witness .

Frank A. Haskell	PERSON	's contemporary narrative of the battle of
Gettysburg	LOCATION	.

		A native of
New England	LOCATION	, a grad - uate of
Dartmouth	LOCATION	, and a
Wisconsin	LOCATION	lawyer at the outbreak of the Civil War , Colonel
Haskell	PERSON	was killed at Cold Harbor in
1864	DATE	.

		At
Gettysburg	LOCATION	he was an aide-de-camp on the staff of General
Gibbon	PERSON	, who temporarily commanded the Second corps of
Meade	ORGANIZATION	's army .


Hancock	PERSON	and
Gibbon	PERSON	were both wounded on the third day of the battle , and the opportunity thus came to Colonel
Haskell	PERSON	to take upon himself the bringing up of reinforcements , to distinguish himself by intelligent appreciation of the urgent needs of the moment , and by personal bravery , and also to see much of the contest that raged about the centre of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	line .

		A few days after the battle he rode back to the field from
Maryland	LOCATION	, and confirmed his conception of its topography .

		His narrative of the campaign , dated
July 16 , 1863	DATE	, was first published by his family , and a second edition , with certain unfortunate alter - ations and omissions , was printed by the
Dartmouth College Class of 1854	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is to be regretted that the present edition -- the third -- of this important chapter of contemporary evidence should not have given the narrative just as it was written by Colonel
Haskell	PERSON	.

		His classmate ,
Hall	PERSON	, an aide-de-camp on
General Howard	ORGANIZATION	's staff , has attempted to justify the omissions and alterations , in a foot-note in the pres - ent edition , with the unwarranted assumption that
Haskell	PERSON	, if he had lived , would have changed his view .

		Such an assumption is especially to be condemned from the fact that the suppressed views of Colonel
Haskell	PERSON	were the views always maintained by the most competent officers in the army --
Hancock	PERSON	,
Humphreys	PERSON	,
Warren	PERSON	,
Gibbon	PERSON	, and
General Meade	ORGANIZATION	himself .

		Functions and The ChuTch of To-day is a subject Ihe ^ Church ^ ^ ^ ^ offers SO many phases -- phases of To-day .

		so difficult of reconciliation and cap - able of so much deficiency and so much exaggeration in their presentation -- that candor and adequacy in a book about it are very observable qualities .

		The little volume of Dr.
Joseph Henry Crooker	PERSON	-LRB- `` The Church of To-day , ''
Pilgrim Press	ORGANIZATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	-RRB- is re - markable both for comprehensiveness and sobriety .

		The author works up to the line of truth , and rarely if ever transcends it .

		The functions he assigns the Church , and the reasons he gives for its existence , are sound and sufficient , and bear the emphasis put upon them .

		Even an opponent , if there is any pene - trative and lenient thought in him , can hardly fail to feel that the subject is broader and profounder than he has been accustomed to regard it .

		So gen - eral a movement among mankind , taking on so many directions , must stand closely associated with equally universal natural forces .

		An habitual mistake means something .

		This copious rendering of reasons , in the searching light of our time , in behalf of an institution so often and so deeply in error , means very much .

		The presentation is somewhat ideal , as it needs must be ; yet the real Church so opens the way to it , and gives so much impulse in the pursuit , that we feel at once that conception , search , and attainment are one growing and indivisible blessing .

		If the part played by the
Church	ORGANIZATION	is so comprehensive and catholic as not only to shake off special faults and bigotries , but to place every organization of this order on the broad basis of service rendered , we are led , without carping or criticism , to find in it the truest and simplest means of progress .

		There are gathered up in the Church -- a church that may assume forms as numerous as are the wants of men , and is to be judged in each of them by its imme - diate adaptability -- a depth and wealth of motive , a ceaseless incentive to effort not otherwise to be attained .

		The frequent failures of the Church indi - cate not so much its lack of intrinsic fitness as they do the ever-growing labor laid upon it .

		The author of this thoughtful book is to be congratulated on the inner light he brings to the theme , and his clear per - ception of its significance .

		Few great men of so long ago are inEnXtX ^ .

		represented by so large and rich a collection of letters as
Martin Luther	ORGANIZATION	.

		And these letters illuminate his career from every point of view , -- as reformer , as one of the founders of the modern High German tongue , and as a great typical German .

		They have been collected and well edited in
Germany	LOCATION	by De Wette ,
Kolde	PERSON	, and
Enders	PERSON	, aside from the smaller selections from them that appear in the various biogi'aphies and household editions of Luther 's works .

		But Luther is too little known at first hand by the mass of English-speaking people .

		Following the attitude of the
Lutheran Church	ORGANIZATION	, he has been represented as an almost super - human saint , surrounded already by a body of folk - lore .

		In fact , he was the most German man of the 882 THE DIAL , -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, past , with most of the frailties as well as most of the charm and greatness of the German character .

		This is revealed very frankly in his letters , and it was a good undertaking to present a considerable selec - tion of these to the English world .

		Mrs.
Currrie	PERSON	has followed the text and the chronology of De Wette , and has on the whole been wise in her selections .

		They are the letters which are most commonly cited in Luther biographies .

		In fact , they would constitute of themselves a fair biography of Luther if only they had been provided with more prefatory and explan - atory matter .

		It would have been desirable to introduce this matter at the expense even of some of the selections .

		It should have been stated , also , that the letters have been cut and altered in detail very much beyond what is indicated by the usual signs of omission .

		Finally , it is a great pity that a volume otherwise so handsomely and carefully prepared should not have been submitted to thorough criti - cism by an expert German scholar .

		Not only is the translation very free , -- it suffers from the presence on almost every page of numerous and serious errors in sense .


Eobanus Hesse	PERSON	, the humanist , is named and referred to persistently as
Cobanus Hesse	PERSON	, an error due evidently to mistaking a German capital E for a C , the two being quite similar .

		In the single short letter to Luther 's wife , of
July 29 , 1534	DATE	, occur these slips : In the ascription the jesting ` master ' -LRB-
Herr	PERSON	-RRB- before '
Kdthe	PERSON	' is omitted ; Wie Du mich losmachst is rendered , ' How long you will get quit of me , ' instead of ' How you can release me ' ; < Sonst komme ich vor dem neuen Bier nicht wieder ' is rendered , ' Or else I shall not be back before the new beer is ready , ' instead of ' Or else I shall never get back -LRB- i. e. , shall die -RRB- for -LRB- i. e. , on account of -RRB- the fresh beer . '

		Aside from this , several phrases are omitted or transposed .

		The translation of the whole book needs careful revision , for the under - taking is important and highly commendable .

Bacon	PERSON	's `` Essayes 7iew edition of or Counsels Civill and Morall '' in
Bacon	LOCATION	's essays , fygsh , clean , modem form , fully an - notated , prefaced , indexed , and otherwise admirably edited , can not do better than turn to the edition that comes from the careful and scholarly hand of
Miss Mary Augusta Scott	ORGANIZATION	, Ph.D. , Professor of English at
Smith College	ORGANIZATION	.

		One likes to learn , in Miss Scott 's preface , that , though she is a teacher of English , she is `` of those who deplore the dis - placement of Latin literature in our schools and colleges by vaguer subjects requiring less mental exertion . ''

		She well says that it is impossible to read
Bacon	LOCATION	understandingly without a knowledge ■ of Latin , as he is likely to quote Tacitus or Cicero or Seneca on almost every page ; and she has , in her editing of the Essays , '' made no effort to min - imize or to popularize '' these ancient classics . ''

		They are of the elect .

		They become more elect , more the aristocrats of letters , as an irrepressible and levelling democracy passes them by on its prim - rose path to an educational ideal of ' small Latin and less Greek . ' ''

		The notes draw frequently on two contemporary works for illustrative and explan - atory matter : they are the
King James	ORGANIZATION	version of the
Bible	LOCATION	and the plays of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		But Miss Scott is no mere bookworm : in the essay '' Of Gardens '' she has identified botanically all the plants and flowers there named , except those so familiar as to need no comment ; and she has also added a posy from
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays wherever possible .

		An eighty-page Introduction , which in - cludes an account of
Bacon	LOCATION	's life and literary work , precedes the Essays , and a full index completes the equipment of this serviceable and inexpensive edition .

		Times and From Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	's Sons comes manners in the latest book of Mr.
Thomas Nelson	PERSON	Old
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		Page , the genial Virginian writer of romances and pleasant historical sketches .

		The present work , which he calls '' The Old Dominion , Her Making and Her Manners , '' consists largely of papers that the author has read before historical societies and other gatherings .

		The collection is an appreciation of what
Virginia	LOCATION	has stood for in American history .

		The author writes in a reverent spirit .

		It is his belief that the early history of
Virginia	LOCATION	deserves more attention . ''

		No page of the history of the race will better repay patient study ; for none shines with more heroic deeds , or more sublime fortitude and.endeavor . ''

		Virginia was '' the foundation of a new nation . '' ''

		She brought forth in time a new civilization where character and cour - tesy went hand in hand ; where the goal ever set before the eye was honor , and where the distin - guishing marks of the life were simplicity and sin - cerity . ''

		The book is about evenly divided as to contents between the old times and the new .

		Chapters one to five , on the Beginnings ,
Jamestown	LOCATION	, Colonial Life , the Revolution , and
the University of Virginia	ORGANIZATION	, while containing no new material , are so well written , with emphasis so well placed , that the lay reader will be thankful to the author for the rewriting .

		The second part , on Reconstruction ,
Virginia	LOCATION	since the War , an Old Neighborhood , and an Old
Virginia	LOCATION
Sunday	DATE	, while good , is of less value historically .

		These latter essays are rather in the nature of an appreciation of social conditions in the latter days .

		The book is a good example of the service a practiced writer may perform in re-casting the work of scientific historians for the benefit of average readers .

		THE DIAL 383 the many beautiful illustrations , there are only two or three ground-plans and no accompanying estimates of cost .

		The object of the pictures is to educate the reader , subtly and by pleasant and easy stages , up to the lesson of the text .

		House-building is an art with which the layman who wants distinctive and lastingly satisfactory results will do well not to meddle .

		He may choose his site , taking care that it is both intrin - sically desirable and suited to his need ; and he must acquaint his architect , who should also be chosen with the utmost consideration , with his family re - quirements .

		Beyond that , it seems , he should be con - tent with the part of on-looker , until , when the house is built and furnished and the site beautified in ac - cordance with the architect 's plan , he may take over his property and enjoy it .

		Granted that the archi - tect is a good one , capable both in planning and in supervision , the enjoyment will be a lasting satis - faction , well worth both the extra cost and the re - nunciation of the delights of dabbling in the plans oneself .

		Having tried to inspire the reader with a wholesome distrust of his own power to superintend the building of just the house he wants , the authors attack certain popular prejudices , such as the insist - ence upon a certain favorite '' style '' for the house , or upon the conventional number of rooms when fewer and larger ones will really serve better .

		The final chapters complete the education of the would-be builder by setting forth some general principles of design and decoration which should guide him in judging architectural effects .

		The book is a strong presentation of the architect 's side of the case , -- but we think few house-builders will be willing to renounce , quite so completely as is here urged , a share in the planning and buUding of a house which they are to live in and pay for .

North America	LOCATION	.

		-LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- a volume on John and
Sebastian Cabot	PERSON	, the accredited discoverers of the North American continent , concerning whom com - paratively so little is known , Mr.
Frederick A. Ober	PERSON	takes occasion to present in readable form an account of the voyages of the Northmen to the western con - tinent five hundred years before the Cabots , and thus makes his book a narrative of discoveries in the region which we now know as
North America	LOCATION	.

		He is not in sympathy with the younger
Cabot	PERSON	, or with his claims to have been an original discoverer ; but he gives a vivid picture of his relations to his con - temporaries , makes a contribution to the history of post-Columbian discoveries and explorations , and succeeds in disentangling some of the contradictory accounts in which the history of those discoveries has been involved .

		For example , he presents and sums up the evidence , which he finds conclusive , that
John Cabot	PERSON	was in command of a ship that made a voyage to
America	LOCATION	in
1497	DATE	, and that he landed on the northeast coast , probably between Labrador and
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	.

		BRIEFER MENTION .


M. Georges Pellissier	PERSON	has written a volume on '' Voltaire Philosophe '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Colin -RRB- in which he sets forth the ideas of
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	upon metaphysics , religion , ethics , and politics .

		The author has made an interest - ing book , and has done his work conscientiously , having read the complete works of Voltaire by way of prepar - ation .

		`` We fancy that few writers upon the subject may claim as much .

		His standpoint is one of sympa - thetic admiration , but he is by no means an uncritical eulogist .

		He does the public a particular service in correcting the errors of many of
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	's ignorant or inimical critics .

		A volume of `` Studies in
Mew England Transcen	LOCATION	- dentalism , '' by Professor
Harold Clarke Goddard	PERSON	, is published in the series of ''
Columbia University Studies	ORGANIZATION	in English . ''

		It is a work of limited scope and inten - sive character , being primarily a study of the Unitarian movement as it merged into transcendentalism , and giving rather more attention to Channing and
Parker	PERSON	than to
Emerson	LOCATION	and
Thoreau	LOCATION	.

		The relations of tran - scendentalism to the practical life are discussed at much length , and there is a valuable appendix on the influence of German literature on nineteenth century
New England	LOCATION	thought . ''

		A Teacher of Dante '' is the title given to a volume containing seven studies in ItaUan literature from the pen of Mr.
Nathan Haskell Dole	PERSON	, published by
Mo # Pat	PERSON	,
Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The most instructive chapter is the first , which gives its name to the collection .

		As to the other sections , we hardly need say that it is impossible to be uninteresting when one is writing under such captions as '' Lyric Poetry and
Petrarca	PERSON	, '' ''
Boccaccio	PERSON	and the Novella , '' or ''
Alfieri	PERSON	and Tragedy . ''

		The essays are obviously intended for the general reader , so we may be excused from recording any detailed criticism .

		On the whole , however , our impression is rather imsatisfactory ; for we can not escape the feeling that the book might have been made much more valuable by its well-known author , as well as more attractive .

		The students of history in our high schools may not be grateful , but they certainly ought to be , for the intelligence and judgment that have gone into recent text-books for their use .

		The gratitude of the teachers is , of course , beyond question .

		Of the many good books in this field that have been prepared of recent years , none are more admirable than those which we owe to Professor
James Harvey Kobinson	PERSON	.

		His latest work , in two volumes , is `` The Development of
Modem Europe	LOCATION	, '' a work designed as an introduction to the study of current history .

		Covering only the period from the age of
Louis XIV	ORGANIZATION	.

		to the present time , these volumes present a much more ample treatment of the subject than is found in the ''
Western Europe	LOCATION	'' of the same series .

		Professor
Charles E. Beard	PERSON	has collab - orated with Professor
Robinson	PERSON	in the preparation of this work , which , like its predecessors , is pubhshed by
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Holland celebrates this
summer	DATE	the tercentenary of the birth of her greatest painter , and the attention of the English-speaking world is called to the fact by the pubUcation of an extra number of '' The International Studio '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- with seventy plates reproducing
Rembrandt	PERSON	's work and an appreciative commentary upon them by
Emile Michel	PERSON	, the French critic whose monumental work on
Rembrandt	ORGANIZATION	brings together so 384 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, ably the results of modern research into the facts of the painter 's life and achievement .

		The present essay does not , of course , attempt to be exhaustive either as com - ment or biography ; but because the author has his material in perfect command he has been able to com - press a very vivid picture of the painter 's personality and artistic development , and a clear account of his life as it related itself to his work , into a little over a hundred pages .

		His criticism does not confine itself wholly to the plates , and it keeps that happy mean between super - ficiality and technicality that is as rare as it is satisfac - tory .

		The plates , which are in photogravure or in tint on separately mounted sheets , are fine examples of the modern art of illustration , and for them alone the book would be well worth having .

		They include , besides many of Rembrandt 's masterpieces , landscapes and other studies in chalk , sepia , pen , and wash , and a number of etchings .
