		He has an irresistible theme , and he writes irresistibly .

		All the quiet charm of ''
Peter Ibbetson	PERSON	'' comes back to the reader as he opens the
October Harper	PERSON	's at the page where '' The Martian '' begins , and not even the imperishable
Paris	LOCATION	of '' Trilby '' has a sweeter glamour than that which is thrown over the
Paris	LOCATION	of these opening chapters ... The romance has the ring of Mr.
Du Maurier	PERSON	's best romancing ; the simple , almost nai 've , admiration of the boys for
Barty	PERSON	shows the author as we have known him in his highest estate , true , wise , free from the slightest suspicion of sentimentality or cant . ''

		The Martian '' opens again the portals of his delightful world , the story revives the tenderness , the sweetness , the original magic which many readers have feared could never be re-captured , and the four or five pictures reveal unmistakably the same hand that wrought the text .

		The recent celebration of the longest reign in English history has naturally called forth a great quantity of retrospective writing , and the history of progress during the sixty years of the Victorian period has been discussed in all of its aspects .

		In such a review of an eventful term of years , the history of literature neces - sarily plays a considerable part , and , in this case , the delimitation of a period by the dates of a reign is somewhat less arbitrary and arti - ficial than it is in others .

		It has often been pointed out that the Victorian age is one of the most distinctly defined in English literary his - tory , and it seems as certain as anything of the sort reasonably can be that the term ''
Victor	PERSON	- ian '' will become as fixed a thing in our literary annals as the term '' Elizabethan '' has been for the past two centuries .

		In point of fact , as every student knows , the former term is a better fit than the latter ; for what we call Victorian literature really belongs to the reign of the present Queen , while a large part of what is commonly called Elizabethan is , strictly speak - ing ,
Jacobean	LOCATION	, being seventeenth-century work .

		Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	goes so far as to reckon
Milton	PERSON	and his contemporaries within the Elizabethan period , and it is hardly probable that future historians will call Victorian the poets -LRB- if there are any -RRB- of the next mid-century .

		Perhaps the most astonishing reflection sug - gested by the subject of the Jubilee is that when
Victoria	PERSON	came to the throne in
1837	DATE	,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	and
Scott	PERSON	had been dead only five years .

		The mood of
Browning	PERSON	's question , '' Did you once see Shelley plain ? ''

		comes upon us when we realize that there must be a number of people living to-day who have seen and spoken with the poet at
Weimar	LOCATION	or with the novelist at
Abbotsford	LOCATION	, and that the reign of one monarch stretches back from the present year to a time when the loss of those two men was still fresh in the heart .

		They seem in so many ways so immeasurably remote from us even if we have taken from them daily inspiration all our lives long that it is difficult to imagine a time when men felt about them as we of to-day feel , for example , about
Tennyson	PERSON	and Renan .

		When we note , also , that
Coleridge	PERSON	and Lamb had died in
1834	DATE	, and that , in the very year 6 THE DIAL -LSB-
July	DATE	l , of
Her Majesty	ORGANIZATION	's coronation , the fatal bullet had sped to
Puskin	LOCATION	's heart , while
Leopardi	PERSON	had dashed himself to death against the prison-bars of an existence that ever seemed to him intolerable , the mood of retrospection becomes deepened in us , and we wonder that such '' far-off things '' can thus be linked with our own lives .

		We often speak of '' books of the year . ''

		Let us see what these books were in the year of grace
1837	DATE	.

		In poetry , there was
Browning	PERSON	's '' Strafford , '' which had already been preceded by ''
Pauline	PERSON	'' and ''
Paracelsus	ORGANIZATION	, '' but the poet had not yet found his audience , and was des - tined to wait for a full generation before tak - ing his place in the temple of fame .

		In fiction ,
Bulwer	PERSON	's ''
Ernest Maltravers	PERSON	'' appeared , and strengthened the hold upon the public already secured by ''
Rienzi	PERSON	, '' '' The Last Days of Pom - peii , '' and eight or nine other novels .

		Far more popular than these works , however , were the productions of a young writer known as `` Boz , '' who had published his famous '' Sketches '' the year before , and who , in the year of the coronation , completed the immortal `` Pickwick , '' and began the publication of '' Oliver Twist . ''

		In this year , also ,
Disraeli	PERSON	published `` Venetian , '' and stood midway in his flamboyant career as a writer of fiction .

		As for
Thackeray	PERSON	, his first serious appearance in lit - erature dates from this same year , with the publication of '' The Yellowplush Papers . ''

		The more solid '' books of the year '' were Whewell 's '' History of the Inductive Sciences , ''
Hallam	PERSON	's '' Literature of
Europe	LOCATION	, ''
Lockhart	PERSON	's biography of
Scott	PERSON	, and
Carlyle	PERSON	's '' French Revolution , '' at last rewritten after the heartbreaking destruc - tion of its first draft .

		When we bring together these titles that mean so much to the student of English literature , we can not help wondering whether any books of pure literature produced in the year
1897	DATE	will stand as high `` sixty years hence '' as '' Strafford '' and '' Pickwick '' do now ; whether the year has produced his - tories that will wear as well as
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	and
Hallam	PERSON	have worn , or a biography that is worthy to be ranked with
Lockhart	PERSON	's great achieve - ment .

		We have singled out for mention nine En - glish books of the year
1837	DATE	.

		Let us make the number ten by adding , merely for its suggest - iveness ,
Harriet Martineau	PERSON	's '' Society in Amer - ica . ''

		The condition of English literature on this side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	may be outlined by saying that
Irving	PERSON	had produced the greater part of his work , that rather more than half of
Cooper	ORGANIZATION	's tales had been given to the world , that the poetical reputation of
Bryant	PERSON	was well established , while the foundations were laid for the reputations of
Whittier	LOCATION	and
Longfellow	LOCATION	, and that the very year with which we are con - cerned was that in which
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's address on '' The American Scholar '' was heard and the `` Twice-Told Tales '' of Hawthorne collected for publication .

		While the showing for the year is not a remarkable one , even when we cast
Prescott	PERSON	's '' Ferdinand and Isabella '' into the balance , it is evident that American litera - ture was fairly on its feet , and that its future was promising enough .

		It is a curious coincidence that both the foremost American writer and the foremost English writer now living should have been born in the same year , and that the year of the accession of the Queen .

		With all his critical vagaries and artistic inequalities , the position of Mr.
Ho	PERSON	wells as our leading man of letters to-day may hardly be disputed , while the place of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	, as not merely the greatest of living English poets , but as the greatest poet now living in the world , is beyond any possible question .

		It is difficult to think of either of these men as venerable , but sixty years goes far toward making up the normal tale of human life , and both novelist and poet must henceforth , for as long as they shall be spared us , take their places among the .

		elders of the literary hierarchy .

		Mr.
H. D. Traill	PERSON	, in a recent summary of the English literature of the Victorian era , makes a rough division of the sixty years into three periods .

		The first score of years was a flowering time that brought into prominence the seven great names of
Tennyson	LOCATION	,
Browning	PERSON	,
Carlyle	LOCATION	,
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	,
Dickens	PERSON	,
Thackeray	PERSON	, and
Ruskin	PERSON	.

		During the second period the tide '' of high literary achievement was pretty steadily receding , '' and '' with the single , if the splendid , exception of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	, the period not only produced no new poet of supreme genius , but brought forth none with any pretensions to a place in the first rank . ''

		When we think of
Arnold	LOCATION	,
Morris	PERSON	, and
Rossetti	PERSON	, it is impos - sible to accept so rash a dictum as the above , yet it is no doubt true that these names , to - gether with that of
George Eliot	PERSON	, are not enough wholly to redeem the middle Victorian era from the charge of being essentially '' the age of Trollope as a novelist and of
Martin Tupper	PERSON	as a poet . ''

		As for the twenty years now ended , the principal things that Mr.
Traill	PERSON	finds to say are that the art of the novelist has displayed
1897	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL great vitality , and that if the new poets are but '' minor , '' they are far better than the minor poets of earlier periods .

		An examination of cisatlantic English litera - ture during the past sixty years reveals the fact that Mr.
Traill	PERSON	's three-fold division applies to our case also roughly , of course , because all such artificial divisions are rough but well enough to deserve employment .

		That is , our greater American writers accomplished the bulk of the best work during the first twenty - year period ; during the second period there was a distinct decline in productiveness , although a few brilliant names , as in
England	LOCATION	, redeem our literary annals from sterility ; and during the third period we find an expansion of the arts of fiction and poetry corresponding to what Mr.
Traill	PERSON	finds in the literature of his own country .

		All of which facts go to show , what a good many people still need to be shown , that all the deeper forces operating in the development of our common literature operate upon both sides of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	, and that the '' salt estranging sea '' can not bring about any real separation between the literatures of two nations having , up to comparatively recent times , a common history and a common intellectual and social tradition , while they still have , and always must retain , a common unifying speech .

		COMMUNICA TION .

		THE METRE OP `` IN MEMORIAM . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THB DIAL . -RRB-

		Professor
C. Alphonso Smith	PERSON	, in his interesting article on this subject in THE DIAL for
June 16	DATE	, says that he can not believe Mr.
Jennings	PERSON	is right in assuming that Tennyson '' thought he had invented the metre . ''

		The Professor appears to be misled by the fact that
Jennings	PERSON	makes this remark in commenting upon the publication of '' In Memoriam '' in
1850	DATE	.

		At that time the poet doubtless was '' too well versed in the lore of versifi - cation to consider himself the inventor of so simple a metrical combination '' ; but in
1833	DATE	, when he first used the stanza in '' You ask me why , '' etc. , he may not have seen
Herbert	PERSON	's volume , which -LRB- as I have said in my edition of '' In Memoriam '' -RRB- is very rare and scarcely known even to critical students of early English poetry .

		It is more remarkable that Ilossetti should have sup - posed , in
1844	DATE	, that he had rediscovered the metre .

		He had probably read
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's early poems in this form , if not the examples of it in
Herbert	LOCATION	and
Ben Jonson	PERSON	, but had forgotten that they were in the same metre .

		I have personally found that students and teachers who were well read in
Tennyson	LOCATION	had never noticed that these familiar early poems were in the metre of '' In Memo - riam . ''

		I have known more than one college teacher who was so ignorant of the elements of versification that he could not read a line of Shakespeare correctly if it contained any peculiarity of accent or syllabication .

		The study of versification is generally neglected in the secondary schools , and too often in the colleges .

		Apropos of the verse of '' In Memoriam , '' Mr.
Joseph Jacobs	PERSON	, in his little book on the poem -LRB-
London	LOCATION	, 1892 -RRB- , dwells upon the '' poverty and inaccuracy '' of the rhymes .

		He gives in an appendix a list of the '' false rhymes , '' which he makes out to be '' no less than 168 in
1448	DATE	couplets . ''

		The actual number is 48 or less , a few instances being open to question .

		Mr.
Jacobs	PERSON	includes many '' eye rhymes , '' like love , move , which all poets use freely ; and rhymes of dissyllables with mono - syllables , like flower , hour , that are absolutely faultless , the dissyllable being treated as a monosyllable in rhythm as in rhyme by all our poets at will .

		Rhymes like ear , hear , the words differing only by the aspirate , are also reckoned by Mr.
Jacobs	PERSON	, as by some authorities on verse , among his bad ones ; but they are used by
Milton	PERSON	-LRB- who has arms , harms , and high , I , if no others of the kind -RRB- and by many other poets .

		Tennyson , moreover , occa - sionally uses `` identical rhymes , '' like here , hear , and ours , hours , which are allowed in Italian and certain other languages , and are admitted by sundry English poets familiar with Italian ; as
Milton	PERSON	-LRB- who has ruth ,
Ruth	PERSON	, etc. -RRB- , and
James Russell Lowell	PERSON	-LRB- holy , wholly , etc. -RRB- .

		Besides here , ear -LRB- twice -RRB- , we find in '' In Me - moriam '' art , heart -LRB- twice -RRB- , hearth , earth , arm , harm , and here , hear , whirled , world , and moor , more .

		In the first edition there was another instance of this latter class of rhymes in cv. , which read : '' This holly by the cottage eave , To-night ungather 'd shall it stand ; We live within the stranger 's land , And strangely falls our Christmas eve . ''

		It now reads : '' To-night ungather 'd let us leave This laurel , let this holly stand ; '' etc. .

		The change was evidently made for other reasons than getting rid of the '' identical rhyme . ''

		Rejecting all these rhymes regarded as faulty by Mr.
Jacobs	PERSON	, we still have left some very bad ones : curse , horse ; is , this ; seas , peace ; Lord , guard ; sphere , there ; I , enjoy ; put , short , etc. .

		One , on , occurs three times , to say nothing of gone , one , and one , alone , which , though '' eye rhymes , '' are dubious examples of their class .

		Some familiar rhymes , as Mr.
Jacobs	PERSON	notes , are often repeated : Jlower , hour , eight times ; good , blood , seven times ; while love is rhymed - with prove seven times , and with move or remove eight times .

		THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, THE LATE MASTER OF BALLJOL , .

		*
Benjamin Jowett	PERSON	has had many pupils who have never paced Oxford streets , nor dined at
Balliol	ORGANIZATION	's table .

		They rejoice to have his biog - raphy in their hands to-day .

		It is well printed , well illustrated , well put together .

		Professor
Campbell	PERSON	has narrated the early life , Dr.
Abbott	PERSON	the years of the Mastership .

		They have left
Jowett	PERSON	mainly to speak for himself , and he speaks significantly .

		No period of religious history is likely to be better known than that which begins with `` The Aids to Reflection and Guesses at Truth '' in
1825	DATE	, or with `` The Christian Year '' in
1827	DATE	, and ends with the close of our century .

		The materials are even too copious .

		With the lives of Dr.
Martineau	PERSON	and
Archbishop Temple	ORGANIZATION	, when they shall be written , the collection for the future church historian to consider will be com - plete .

		The life of
Jowett	PERSON	is the last important addition .

		Perhaps its authors might have a more sensitive eye for local color , or keener scent for an illustrative anecdote .

		In their scrupulous exclusion of the '' mythology '' which springs up in the footprints of any marked per - sonality , they have perhaps gone too far .

		But we are in no mood for fault-finding .

		There is enough to enjoy and to be thankful for ; too much easily to digest .

		It was at the beginning of the long peace that followed the battle of
Waterloo	LOCATION	, in the year of the death of
Jane Austen	PERSON	and
Madame de Stael	ORGANIZATION	, that , on
April 15 , 1817	DATE	,
Benjamin Jowett	PERSON	was born .

		Through two previous
Ben	PERSON	- jamins , his father and grandfather , he traced his lineage to an austere patriarch , a convert of
Whitefield	LOCATION	, a
London	LOCATION	tradesman , of a plain yeoman stock , two of whose sons had been men of mark at
Cambridge	LOCATION	, as tutor at
Magdalen	LOCATION	, and Professor of Civil Law .


Jowett	PERSON	's father was associated with
Lord Shaftesbury in Fac	ORGANIZATION	- tory Eeform .

		He was a reserved , disinterested , lovable man , unsuccessful in business and in journalism , a devotee of music , a stout con - servative and orthodox churchman .

		It was in a sincerely religious household , of narrow means and modest station , bright with books and music and the air of liberal culture , that
Jowett	PERSON	passed a delicate and precocious childhood .

		By
Evelyn Abbott	PERSON	, M.A and
Lewis Campbell	PERSON	,
M.A.	LOCATION	.

		In two volumes , with portrait and illustrations .


New York	LOCATION	:
E. P. Button & Co	ORGANIZATION	When his companions were at play he would be stretched on the hearth-rug over Pope 's Homer or
Rollins	PERSON	's Ancient History .

		He knew his
Cowper	PERSON	almost by heart , as he knew
Virgil	PERSON	and Sophocles and Shakespeare afterwards .

		At
St. Paul	ORGANIZATION	's school from the age of twelve , a round-faced , bright-eyed urchin , clad in '' a perpetual sort of green sateen jacket , '' not at all a boy 's boy , a serious student and voracious reader ,
Jowett	PERSON	held his own as the best Latinist of the school and as one who could speak out what he chose to say .

		It was a power that endured with him .

		The decisive incident of his career , '' the happiest event of his life '' as he called it , was winning a Balliol scholarship .

		Beginning at nineteen , '' a puny chubby-faced lad , '' he went on in a natural scholastic evolution , from under - graduate to fellow , tutor , professor , master of his college , and vice-chancellor of the
Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity .

		Among his instructors were
William George Ward	PERSON	and
Archibald Tait	PERSON	, the future Archbishop .

		Stanley and
Temple	ORGANIZATION	,
John Cole	PERSON	- ridge and
Stafford Northcote	PERSON	,
Church	ORGANIZATION	,
Froude	PERSON	,
Brodie	PERSON	, and
John Ruskin	PERSON	were among his con - temporaries .

		It was an exciting time and a stimulating group .


Newman	PERSON	was still preach - ing at
St. Mary 's	ORGANIZATION	and
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	still sending up earnest students from Rugby .


Jowett	PERSON	was too busy and too poor to indulge himself much in society , nor was he swept away with the theo - logical whirlwinds about him .

		Already one of his distinctive gifts was visible .

		In whatever stress of conflict , he preserved '' a characteristic calm , a passionless tenacity . ''

		Again , as among his schoolmates , he '' held his own . ''

		Securing , while yet an undergraduate , a fel - lowship of his college in successful competition with maturer men ,
Jowett	PERSON	settled down to his university life .

		It was broken only by brief vacation journeys .

		Family cares pressed hard upon him , though he never married ; there was no money for extended travel until too late .

		Latinist as he was , he never saw
Rome	LOCATION	.

		Trans - lator of
Plato	ORGANIZATION	and Aristotle and Thucydides as he was , he never saw
Athens	LOCATION	.

		Far and wide ihrough time and space ranged his discursive ntellect , but his outward frame kept close to Dxford lawns and cloisters .

		Early responsi - bility came to him .

		He was tutor at twenty - ive , with
Arthur Clough	PERSON	and
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	for pupils .

		The reputation of his college quickly rose .

		It came to be expected that his pupils should take First Classes .

		He was a teacher complete to the finger-tips , suggestive in all he ' ; aught .

		He stimulated young minds , gave them
1897	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL methods , not results , gave them a wholesome distrust of the words that override things , the terminology which so often obscures truth .

		He began at this time to shed some of his tradi - tional evangelicalism , while always clinging to its essential verities .

		For a time
Newman	PERSON	attracted him .

		He was ready to think that if
Newman	PERSON	and his friends could gain in charity toward those who differed from them , their work might be '' almost one of unmixed good . ''

		It was a vast '' if , '' quickly followed by an '' alas '' upon further acquaintance .

		Now and always
Jowett	PERSON	hated religious agitation , while believing it sometimes a duty .

		He disliked religious discussion even with close friends .

		In later years he grew to set a higher value on outward expression , and was willing to risk cant rather than banish religion from familiar talk .

		He was anything but the satisfied rationalist , the jaunty liberal that Mallock caricatured in the '' New Republic . ''

		In every letter you feel the presence of a profoundly earnest and bur - dened believer , whose heart repels the doubts that his reason has suggested .

		Yet for all his shrinking from doubt , he would not stifle inquiry .

		The vision of the naked truth might be ever so terrible ,
Jowett	PERSON	must look with open eyes .

		He must champion the truth and speak out plainly .

		But he will insist that even error shall have fair play .

		He will stand with
Stanley for Ward	ORGANIZATION	in a moment of universal panic , until the tragedy dissolved in laughter at ''
Hilde	PERSON	- brand the Married Man . ''

		It was to that '' Socrates-Silenus , '' as
Jowett	PERSON	once nicknamed
William George Ward	PERSON	, that
Jowett	PERSON	owed his introduction to metaphysics .

		The new study for a while entranced him , but presently he weighed it and found it wanting .

		It lifted him out of the fogs of tradition into other vaporous regions of its own .

		Presently all clouds dispersed and he saw clearly .

		He come to look upon metaphysics as intellectual exercise rather than attainment , '' a necessity rather than a great good .

		Its air is too rare - fied to breathe long . ''

		His study of
Hegel	ORGANIZATION	left behind it a permanent deposit of the Hegelian attitude and method , and his comment on Hegelianism in the introduction to Plato 's '' Sophist '' is lucid and sympathetic .

		Yet he was never
Hegel	PERSON	's , nor was he any man 's , dis - ciple .

		It was about
1847	DATE	that , with
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	and
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	and others ,
Jowett	PERSON	undertook the cause of
University Reform	ORGANIZATION	.

		Always a radical , he was never a revolutionist .

		Because he went to the root of things he understood that time must be a factor in all healthy change and permanent progress . ''

		Nothing I wish less than to see
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	turned into a German or a
London University	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		As he said earlier , '' I wonder people do not feel the curse of hav - ing no old to entwine with the new . ''

		But he felt strongly that
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	needed reform , and that only fit reform could forbid revolution .

		In comparison with foreign universities , Ox - ford still remained mediaeval . ''

		We are so far below the level of the German ocean that I fear we shall one day be utterly deluged . ''

		So
Jowett	PERSON	did his part to bring his university nearer to his age .

		He was the natural successor to the Master - ship , when , in
1854	DATE	, Dr.
Jenkins	PERSON	died .

		Theo - logical prejudice prevailed and a '' safer '' and more learned , but less able , man was elected .

		It was not what
Jowett	PERSON	had yet done which turned the scales , but what he was felt to be capable of doing .

		As always , he would speak out .

		He justified the anxieties of his opponents by publishing his volumes on certain of
St. Paul	ORGANIZATION	's Epistles .

		The work was most original and bold .

		Before it was quite understood how bold , the Greek professorship fell vacant .


Jowett	PERSON	's fitness for it was beyond question , and he was elected at the paltry stipend of forty pounds a year .

		Friends came forward with a gift to make up the deficiency .

		But
Jowett	PERSON	re - fused it and waited ten years for the authori - ties to do what they should , and raise the sal - ary to the fit sum of five hundred pounds .

		Meantime he did not magnify his grievance , nor waste strength in bewailing it .

		With or without due compensation , he would work as if he perceived no connection between work and wages .

		To work was his business , to see that he was paid was Dr.
Pusey	PERSON	's or any other
Doc	PERSON	- tor 's responsibility .

		It was '' heroic industry '' with him at all times .

		As formerly in his tutorship , so now in his professorship , he spent himself for his pupils .

		He treated his relation to them as a pastoral charge , his department of Christian ministry .

		At all hours his door stood open .

		He was at the beck and call of anyone who needed him .

		It is hard to see how he got through his own work , thus busy with every man 's .

		He demanded from his stu - dents their best , implied a belief in their unde - veloped possibilities , '' and the belief seemed to create the thing believed in . ''

		Nor did his in - terest end with the days of their pupilage .

		Letter upon letter shows how faithfully and lovingly he followed them , with what tact and wisdom he counselled or chid them .

		He would 10 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, not cramp or enslave them .

		He would not rivet their growing minds upon a mould of his .

		He would only help them to be most and best themselves .

		He had doubtless his disappoint - ments , but he had also his rich rewards in a devotion , an affection , as he said with tears , '' far beyond his deserts . ''

		They judged best of that .

		The two stout octavos on the Epistles to the Thessalonians , Romans , and
Galatians	PERSON	were a contribution to a Commentary on the whole New Testament projected by Dr.
Arnold	PERSON	, which
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	and
Jowett	PERSON	long hoped to complete .

		If the first sample of
Jowett	PERSON	's method had met with greater favor , perhaps the purpose had been more fully accomplished and the Church yet more his debtor .

		The time was not ripe . ''

		I thought I had so expressed myself that re - ligious minds could not be wounded , ''
Jowett	PERSON	wrote .

		He did not find it so .

		He had not only laid aside accepted terminology , but he had touched to the quick cherished preconceptions , entangled as they were with deep religious feel - ing .

		He had assumed that all men loved the truth as purely as he and were as ready to wel - come any frank presentation of it .

		He had studied
St. Paul	ORGANIZATION	in his own light , and refused to subject him to controversial fires .

		To
Jowett	PERSON	the epistles appeared to be , not dogmatic trea - tises , but occasional letters preserved where others had been lost , revealing the mind and character of their author , and disclosing the period of his labors , as well as inspired with a precious message .

		Only by implication could the work be held controversial .

		It argued with nobody , refuted nobody .

		It asserted principles , suggested parallels , appealed to reason and con - science , and left the result to the judgment of open-minded readers .

		It was not that
Jowett	PERSON	rejected , but that he ignored as irrelevant , the authority of Greek or Latin fathers and
Angli	LOCATION	- can divines .

		What said
St. Paul	ORGANIZATION	's Greek in a dialect which was Hebraic and not classical ?

		What did such words from such a man at such a time really signify ?

		What was their force , broadly interpreted in the spirit rather than the letter , not as a legal document or theolog - ical dogma , but as impassioned and practical discourse ?

		What lessons of immediate duty had they for men to-day ?

		These were the ques - tions
Jowett	PERSON	sought to ask and answer , in sim - ple notes that did not evade difficulties and luminous disquisitions which marked an epoch in English theology .

		Since the days of the
Cambridge Platonists	LOCATION	, if we except
Coleridge	PERSON	and
Arnold	LOCATION	, no such voice had been heard as this . ''

		There was no mistaking what this man meant . ''

		There is much of such frank discus - sion now ; then there was little .

		Divines were enlisted in party camps and rarely ventured beyond them .

		This man walked in the open .

		His neighbors first stared , then grew pale , then reddened with rage .

		He held that when men were inspired they still remained human .

		It was a dangerous proposition ; it was no better than
Milman	PERSON	's calling Abraham an Arab sheik .

		It meant mischief , nobody knew exactly what or how , but it must be put down before it should go farther .

		Yet this was not the worst .


Jowett	PERSON	had ventured upon a thorough treat - ment of the great theme of the Atonement .

		The subject was in the air .

		Independently , at the same period ,
McLeod Campbell	ORGANIZATION	was handling it in
Scotland	LOCATION	and
Horace Bushnell	PERSON	in Con - necticut .

		It was a theme so interwoven with the most sacred memories and experiences that it could not be touched without jarring upon many of the simple and devout , as well as upon all the bigoted and dogmatic , spirits of the time .

		To use
Stuart Mill	PERSON	's luminous distinction , it was not what it denoted but what it connoted that gave occasion for alarm .


Jowett	PERSON	, who always dealt with truth as in a vacuum , forgot that others saw her veiled in a cloud and could not distinguish a dispersion of the vapor from an outrage upon the form .

		He spoke out plainly and gave more offence than there was need to give .

		To remove such obstructions the essay was rewritten for the edition of
1859	DATE	.

		Another essay was not ready for either the first or the second edition .

		In the
third edition of 1894	DATE	it has found its place .

		It was upon the inter - pretation of Scripture , and formed part of the volume called '' Essays and Reviews . ''

		That very unequal volume by several hands roused a violent commotion .

		The orthodoxy of the church was morbidly irritable .

		Convo - cation lost its head .

		Clamor and panic ruled the hour .

		Scholars like
Thirlwall	PERSON	, recent her - esiarchs like Hampden , even liberals like Mau - rice , joined the cry .

		The heresy-hunt began .


Jowett	PERSON	had spoken out , and now quietly held his own .

		Pained by the obloquy , he made no complaint , offered no apology .


Phillips Brooks	PERSON	in like case was grandly silent .

		It was a wise attitude at a season when men thought '' that no enlightened person should be - come a clergyman , and that the clergyman who became enlightened should be unfrocked . ''

		American opinion reflected English .

		When our one
Broad Church	ORGANIZATION	bishop of that period denied that each particle of the buried body
1897	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 11 would be re-united with its fellows in the final resurrection , an able layman remarked that the denial was just , but dreadful from the lips of a bishop .


Jowett	PERSON	said that if it rained mitres no one of them could possibly fit him .

		Cer - tainly no mitre could have muzzled him and no storm beating upon his mitred or unmitred head could have dismayed him .

		In a letter to Ten - nyson 's children he gave them in capitals two golden counsels , Never Fear and Never Cry .

		He had tried them both before giving them .

		He stood his ground and scorned to whimper .

		He liked success , owned to a prejudice against those who fail , but for his own part his only recognition of failure was as a spur to effort .

		It did not embitter him , if it left him sore .

		He would patiently tolerate even the intoler - ant .

		But he would `` wait for another world before joining in any closer union with them . ''

		It is the very instinct of self-preservation , akin to his who said of certain troubling spirits : '' They are good people .

		We shall meet them in heaven , and that is soon enough . ''


Jowett	PERSON	was seventy years old when a serious illness left him a chronic invalid , compelled to measure his tasks and reduce his hours of working .

		Still he made great plans and would toil to the last . ''

		What a fate , '' he said , '' for a man to retire for contemplation , and then to find he had nothing to think about .

		But per - haps he would never find out ! ''

		was his play - ful comment .

		Such hapless lot could not be
Jowett	PERSON	's .

		If he had nothing else to think of there were always the affairs of his friends to interest him .

		He had a marvellous genius for friendship and could love a score as few men can love anyone .

		The close of his life was shadowed by their departure .

		Stanley ,
Lord Iddesleigh	PERSON	,
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	,
Robert Brown	PERSON	- ing ,
Lord Sherbrooke	LOCATION	,
Alfred Tennyson	PERSON	, were gone , and it was time for an old man to 41 Wrap the drapery of his couch About him and lie down to pleasant dreams . ''

		At
Hedly Park	ORGANIZATION	, on a visit to dear friends , the not unwelcome summons came .

		It was a Sun - day afternoon , the first day of
October	DATE	in the year
1893	DATE	.

		As he lay in his last sleep '' the moon shone in and lit up his beautiful marble face and the shining white hair .

		There seemed a blending of the dignity of age and the sim - plicity and radiant freshness of youth . ''

		Among his last words were : '' Mine has been a happy life .

		I bless God for my happy life . ''

		It had been a rarely wise and useful and dis - tinguished life .

		It had spared no labor to at - tain excellence , it had spent itself on others , it had kept ever before it noble aims .


Jowett	PERSON	had early discerned the preciousness and ma - jesty of truth , and had followed where truth led him through all mazes of opinion .

		If he threw down idols it was not from love of de - struction , but to make room for the living spirit whose place they had usurped .

		Nothing can be less just than to regard
Jowett	PERSON	as one who sought revolution or fostered unbelief .

		He encountered and brushed aside doubts on his way to positive convictions . ''

		Doubt , '' he said in one of those earnest sermons which he preached to the young men with whom his days were spent , '' is not some great exertion of the mind , but mere weakness ... We may hope to live through it like other disorders . ''

		He declared indulgence in doubt '' the spirit most alien to that of inquiry .

		It might be called the ghost of inquiry . ''

		He bewailed the scep - tic mood which an age of science , not yet con - scious of its own limitations , had bred among the young .

		He felt that it was a mood not to be argued down but to be lived down . ''

		Our reason is in great measure dependent upon our will . '' ''

		Belief must radiate from life .

		What we are in a certain sense we shall believe . ''

		In his sermons and in his letters you feel that this great teacher is not primarily concerned with thought but with conduct and character , that he is moralist and pastor of souls even more than theologian or philosopher .

		You feel that to him simple goodness is the soul 's chief good . ''

		Let us know no other watchwords but the life of
Christ	LOCATION	, the mind of
Christ	LOCATION	, the cross of Christ , '' he said .

		The accusers of
Ian Maclaren	PERSON	and Bishop
Sessums	PERSON	might perhaps detect flaws in
Jowett	LOCATION	's theology .

		His working creed was more brief than the Athanasian symbol .

		It did not define miracles or state the precise limits of nature and the supernatural .

		It did not sharply dis - sever the inspiration of the Psalmists and
St. Paul	ORGANIZATION	from that of
Plato	ORGANIZATION	and
Tennyson	LOCATION	.

		It laid more stress on holiness than upon sin , upon love and pity than upon wrath and judgment .

		It emphasized the ethical elements of religion and found in conduct the safest criterion of character , and in character the surest evidence of life .


Jowett	PERSON	was a man of faith , though he sometimes saw dimly , of hope and love always .

		He was of the pure in heart , who may be blind to many things , but still see God .

		However he erred in opinion , he ever sought and served the truth .

		That is the orthodoxy that will be worth most to us when all accounts are reck - oned up .

		Meanwhile , these are safe watch -

		A former President of

		Then loosed the bandage and the sage , no more A sage but saint , beheld and knelt to adore . ''

		significance in the life which animates and beau - tifies our earth which it is worth our while to consider , not only for the widening of our intel - lectual horizon , but for the continual joy it may infuse into our daily experience .

		There are evidences of this late awakening in various pop - ular movements toward nature-study and in a rapidly increasing literature aiming to promote the same useful purpose .

		The array of books herewith presented testifies to the growing interest in the pages of
Nature	ORGANIZATION	.

		Few volumes are more entertaining than that in which Mr.
Skinner	PERSON	tells of the health and happiness to be found in cultivating '' Nature in a City Yard . ''

		The portion of the earth 's do - main lying in the rear of the author 's
Brooklyn	LOCATION	residence is only eighteen feet by fifty , yet from this restricted area he contrives to extract mar - vels of enjoyment .

		In the height of the flower - ing season he feasts his eyes upon nearly sixty varieties of plants in bloom at the same time .

		All the pleasures of a successful gardener are his ; but to these he adds the refinements of the man of culture , the humorist , and the philosopher .

		As he digs and plants and waters and prunes in his tiny , thrifty precinct , his thoughts are as busy as his hands , and every circumstance connected with his work suggests some sage , shrewd , genial , or merry idea .

		His writing proclaims him a man of versatility , a scholar , a wag , with keen insight , a light heart , and a passionate leaning toward nature . ''

		Pessimism is worse than tragedy , '' he avers ; '' it is a tragedy of the soul ; the attitude of a tired-out race .

		When we keep in touch with Nature we share her splendid life .

		For Nature , even a yardf ul of it , makes health in her communicant .

		Get away from self-consciousness .

		Think not of your mind nor of your fate .

		Why be always thinking on your end ?

		as graveyard literature hath it .

		We are here to live ; not to die . ''

		He is content with his lot ; and , reflecting on the cares and miseries of the rich , cheerily observes that '' The chief blessing of poverty is that other folks do n't ask you to help them to live . ''

		His pages are sown with wise and witty sayings , and provoke many a welcome laugh as well as serious moment of meditation .

		We have but to announce a new volume by Mrs.
Olive Thorne Miller	PERSON	to assure the nature-lover of a literary treat .

		Mrs.
Miller	PERSON	's writings are invariably crisp and spicy , and are composed of substantial as well as appetizing substance .

		`` Upon the Tree - Tops '' brings within a single pair of book - lids thirteen sketches of bird-life which , with one or two ex -
1897	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 13 ceptions , have previously attracted attention in the pages of '' The Atlantic Monthly '' and sim - ilar periodicals .

		They will bear a second pe - rusal , and in their present pretty setting are even more engaging than in their original form .

		They are accompanied by ten full-page engrav - ings by Mr.
F. Carter Beard	PERSON	, which are unus - ually interesting in design and are exquisitely reproduced .

		The opening sketch , describing '' Tramps with an Enthusiast , '' is perhaps the most entertaining of the entire number , from its abundant humor and lively incident .

		If there be a specially blissful experience in this mortal life , it is that which comes to a pair of enthusiastic ornithologists out in the field pursuing the objects of their affection under favorable conditions .

		Such were the circum - stances depicted in this opening chapter .

		Suc - ceeding portions of the volume relate with piquant grace Mrs.
Miller	PERSON	's observations of the humming-bird in nesting-time , the winter wren in its Northern home , the chat , the shrike , and other fascinating members of the feathered race in the happy relations of family life .

		The au - thor is one who looks upon nature with a keen and attentive eye , and tells us little that she has not seen and studied for herself .

		Her con - tributions to bird - literature are therefore as trustworthy in substance as they are agreeable in form .

		It is two years since Mr.
Frank M. Chapman	PERSON	published his valuable handbook on the '' Birds of
Eastern North America	ORGANIZATION	, '' and now he has followed it with a smaller supplementary work in which his masterly attainments in the science of ornithology are equally well shown .

		This second volume does not aim to give as compre - hensive a view of '' Bird Life '' in the
United States	LOCATION	as did the first , but it contains as much of the choicest information regarding a hundred or more of our familiar species as could be compressed within its limits .

		The opening chap - ters present a clear , concise summary of the evolution of the chief features of the bird , of its colors , of the curious phenomena connected with its migration , of its song and its domestic habits , together with directions for identifying and classifying it .

		The concluding portion is filled with attractive descriptions of the species we are most likely to meet in the woods and fields and by the wayside .

		The illustrations with which the book is generously provided are true to the life in form and attitude , and higher praise can not be given .

		The student who selects this work as a guide to his observations of bird - life will not go amiss .

		A half-dozen pleasant Summer sketches by Mr.
T. W. Higginson	PERSON	are included in the vol - ume entitled '' The Procession of the Flowers . ''

		The papers do not now appear in print for the first time .

		Some of them bear a date several years back ; but they well preserve their early freshness and charm .

		Their author has truly said : '' No person can portray nature from any slight or transient acquaintance . ''

		Mr.
Hig	PERSON	- ginson has loved and studied the phases of the out-door world throughout a long life-time .

		He knows the flowers , the insects , the birds , and seldom errs in writing of them .

		Not only their names but their individual traits , their distinc - tive peculiarities , are familiar to him ; and he characterizes each with the right word or the felicitous phrase .

		Of the humming-bird , '' the smallest of feathery things , and the loveliest , '' he asks : '' Did gems turn to flowers , flowers to feathers , in that long-past dynasty of the Humming - Birds ? ''

		And , lost in surprise over the miracle of a bird 's egg , he observes won - deringly : '' That one may bear home between his fingers all that winged splendor , all that celestial melody , coiled in mystery within these tiny walls !

		it is as if a pearl opened and an angel sang . ''

		Such books as '' Memories of the Months , '' by Sir
Herbert Maxwell	PERSON	, exemplify the full value of the powers of observation and appre - ciation .

		Nothing worthy of note escapes the author 's view or fails to yield a due degree of satisfaction .

		The precious habit of looking at things attentively and of transcribing at the instant the points exciting interest has put him in possession of a mass of valuable observations from which his present volume is drawn .

		They relate chiefly to objects in nature , and yet in part refer to the works of man , for the author is an earnest antiquarian as well as field natur - alist .

		Wide culture and a genial frame of mind are reflected in his literary style , which is unpretending and elegant .

		The '' Memories , '' having an intimate connection with the varying seasons , are ranged in sections under the suc - cessive months of the year , and thus form a coherent whole .

		With the embellishment of pictures , the fine letter-press , and the dainty binding , the book is a most attractive one throughout .

		The volume entitled '' Round the Year , '' by Professor
L. C. Miall	PERSON	, contains a series of natural-history sketches suggested by incidents which took place under the author 's observa - tion at different seasons and places in the year
1895	DATE	.

		He is a man of science and a trained 14 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, observer .

		No event in nature escapes his notice , and each is searched with a careful eye , that its origin and destiny may if possible be discovered .

		His sketches cover a multitude of subjects in astronomy , botany , meteorology , ornithology , entomology , and various other ologies .

		He leads the reader into studies that are profound although not prolonged , revealing , as he goes along , a mass of curious and engaging facts , such as lie in every object of the outer world , ready to disclose themselves to the inquiring mind .

		Some of his most interesting investiga - tions are connected with such subjects as '' Snowflakes , '' `` Catkins , '' `` The Cuckoo , '' '' Gossamer , '' '' The Structure of a Feather , '' and ''
Tennyson	PERSON	as a Naturalist . ''

		But his work is of an earnest and even quality through - out , blending instruction with entertainment in the manner of an adroit expounder .

		The book is very handsomely produced , the illustra - tions being especially minute in line and clear in cut . ''

		In the Garden of Peace '' is a winning title , and its effect is fully sustained by the chapters it binds together in a unified construction .

		The '' Garden '' was a '' Paradise of Birds , '' as its owner , ''
Helen Milman	PERSON	, '' asserts on the title - page and clearly establishes in the progress of her volume .

		It belonged to a secluded estate , remote from the village , almost hidden , indeed , by surrounding woods ; and it possessed ideal charms for the lover of Nature in her more quiet forms . ''

		It was aglow with the colors of a thou - sand flowers throughout the seasons of budding and blooming , gay with the butterflies sipping their sweets , and joyous all the year round with the life and the song of the birds which made their homes in every tree and bush , secure of the loved protection of the Adam and Eve who dwelt in unalloyed happiness in the midst of this earthly paradise . ''

		The chapters severally depicting the flowers and the birds glorifying the '' Garden of Peace '' are in such harmony with their spirit that one is soothed and de - lighted as with an actual ^ visit to the lovely scene .

		They impart a fresh sense of the pos - sibilities for the culture of our better selves , which the beautiful objects of nature always possess .

		Mr.
Robert J. Morris	PERSON	displays a decided lit - erary gift , as well as a keen love of sport , in the collection of sketches which bear the name of the first one in the series , ''
Hopkins	PERSON	's Pond . ''

		They have been written without effort and with - out restraint , a fine instinct permitting the au - thor to yield himself with entire abandon to the mood for description or reminiscence .

		He is an animated and engaging narrator , and has a gen - uine appreciation of nature , gaining our hearty good-will through these faculties , despite the lamentable fact that he rejoices in beguiling the duck to his death by means of a base decoy , and delights in torturing the captive trout until its last breath is expired .

		Messrs.
Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's promising series of '' Home Reading Books , '' edited by Dr.
William T. Harris	PERSON	, gives the first place in its
Natural History	ORGANIZATION	division to a valuable little work , by Mr.
James Newton Baskett	PERSON	, relating '' The Story of the Birds . ''

		The title is in a slight degree misleading , as the book is prac - tically a history of the evolution of the birds of their structure , pedigrees , costumes , and customs as far as this can at present be un - folded .

		In every respect it deserves commenda - tion , its author exhibiting a good command of his subject and a persuasive way of presenting it .

		His readers are expected to be largely of the juvenile class ; yet the older students of bird-lore will take pleasure in the volume , and profit also , so skilfully are its contents ordered , so clearly and with so much charm of manner are they set forth .

		There was room in the naturalist 's library for just such a treatise , and Mr.
Baskett	PERSON	has spared no pains to fit his treatise for useful service .

		The book is very neatly printed and excellently illustrated , and to aid the reader in easy reference to its myriad topics a compact analysis of the chapters is fur - nished at the beginning with an ample index at the close .

		To crown the merits of the volume , it is offered at a price so low that the humblest home may lay it among the treasures of its reading-table .

		The second number of Appletons ' series of '' Home Reading Books '' is less satisfactory than the first .

		It is a compilation of passages from various authors , relating to strange and striking members of '' The Plant World . ''

		In too many cases the extracts are not as simple and engaging in style as they should be .

		They lack life , and give one the feeling that they are done at second-hand , rather than from personal knowledge of the objects described .

		A few evince the enthusiasm of the botanist who speaks from actual experience .

		Surely the editor could have found abundant material for his purpose in the works of recent writers who depict Nature in all her forms with an intelli - gence and eloquence which capture the heart of every reader .

		THE DIAL 15 TRAVELS FAR AND VARIOUS .

		* The wheelman contributes a new element of interest to books of travel .

		The story of adventures of the steel steed , on various roads and in peculiar situations , takes the place of remarks , critical and otherwise , on horses and conveyances , or on steam - ers and railways , to which we have become accus - tomed in the older literature of travel .

		One of the latest contributions to the fast increasing books of bicycle travel is '' Sketches Awheel in Modern Iberia , '' by Mr. and Mrs.
W. H. Workman	PERSON	.

		The tale of their trip will hardly encourage imitators , for our authors suffered much from heat and from the villainous roads , were attacked by irate mule - drivers , and were stoned by malicious children .

		However , they sometimes had their reward , as in the forty-mile ride from
Elche	LOCATION	to
Murcia	LOCATION	, of which they say : '' We have taken grand rides , desolate rides , and lovely rides , but never one so intoxicatingly beautiful as this through African
Spain	LOCATION	.

		And in praising we echo the words of a German , one of the few writers on
Spain	LOCATION	who appear to have visited this region , Why is this lovely corner of the world so little known ? ' ''

		They made the tour of the principal cities of
Spain	LOCATION	, and varied their travels by a mule-back ride from
Tangier	LOCATION	to
Tetuan	LOCATION	,
Morocco	LOCATION	.

		The writers have little that is new or notable to tell , and the style is for the most part rather commonplace , though an occasional sketch , as that of their stay at the inn of
Tarancon	LOCATION	, shows considerable descriptive power .

		Foreign words are too much in evidence : in the space of three sentences we notice Spanish , German , and French .

		The book contains a fair map , and the photographic illustrations are clear .

		In ``

E. Neville	PERSON	-
Rolfe	PERSON	, English Consul for

Naples	LOCATION	of yesterday and to-day , on the survivals of ancient paganism and mediaeval witchcraft , on ex - cursions to the buried cities of

		Says our author : '' The time is coming when a Neapolitan will answer a letter , keep an appointment , have some little regard for truth and some small respect for the feelings of his neighbors .

		The cabman will some day drive with whips which do not rend the air with their terrible cracking ; they will learn kindness to animals , and the use of soap and water ; insect life will be kept at bay , and the city will fall to the dead level of
Paris	LOCATION	,
Berlin	LOCATION	, or any other civilized town . ''

		Yet we are glad to believe him when he elsewhere says that ''
Naples	LOCATION	has a quaintness and charm of her own , which municipalities can not destroy , and civilization can not altogether wreck . ''

		The author has long been resident in
Italy	LOCATION	, and , writing from full knowledge , has given us an excellent handbook to
Naples	LOCATION	and to
Campania	LOCATION	in general .

		Captain
S. L. Hinde	PERSON	tells us , in '' The Fall of the Congo Arabs , '' a simple but graphic story of the conquest and expulsion of the Arab traders from
Nyangwe	ORGANIZATION	and Kasongo by the Belgians of the
Congo Free State	ORGANIZATION	.

		This struggle the author regards as '' a turning-point in African history , '' in that it crushed out an incipient
Mohammedan Empire	ORGANIZATION	of slave raiders in the
Congo Basin	LOCATION	.

		Besides this first-hand account of a notable conflict between European and Arab , we find in this book many entertaining and instructive remarks on the country and its inhabit - ants .

		For instance , the author 's descriptions of the African road , of the '' water people , '' and of the pigmies , are distinctly interesting .

		On cannibals and their practices he gives the fullest information we have come across .

		He learned that '' The prisoner or slave who was to form the piece de resistance had always his arms and legs broken three days beforehand , and was then placed in a stream , or pool of water , chin-deep , with his head tied to a stick to prevent his committing suicide , or perhaps falling asleep and thus getting drowned .

		On the third day he was taken out and killed , the meat then being very tender . ''

		Again , he says that '' When the chief of the town who is of course an absolute monarch decides that a man must die , he hands him over to the people .

		He is immediately torn to pieces , and disappears as quickly as a hare is broken up by a pack of hounds .

		Every man lays hold of him at once with one hand , and with the other whips off the piece with his knife ; no one stops to kill him first , for he would by doing so lose his piece . ''

		During the two years ' war with Arabs , cannibalism was rife after battles and the storming of towns ; the '' human wolves disposed of all the dead , leaving nothing even for the jackals . ''

		Finally , as a picture 16 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, of African savagery , we can not refrain from quoting Captain
Hinde	PERSON	's description of N ' Gandu . ''

		The village , containing from ten to fifteen thousand inhabitants , was oval in form , and strongly fortified by a double ditch and loopholed earthwork , the whole being surrounded by a palisade .

		The top of every tree in this palisade was crowned with a human skull .

		Six gateways defended the village ; and , after passing through each gate , it was necessary to traverse a tunnel , some thirty yards long , made out of piles of large tim - ber , and loopholed throughout its whole length .

		On the top of this tunnel was a guardhouse , the floor of which was honeycombed into holes , through which the guard above could spear an unsuspecting passenger on the road below .

		The approach to each of these six gates was ornamented by a pavement of human skulls , the bregma being the only part that showed above ground .

		This pavement was of snowy whiteness , and polished to the smoothness of ivory by the daily passage of hundreds of naked feet .

		I counted more than two thousand skulls in the pavement of one of the gates alone . ''

		We cordially commend this volume as a fresh , enter - taining , and valuable account of a very dark spot in '' darkest
Africa	LOCATION	. ''

		The book contains in its final chapters a description of an exploring trip up the
Lualaba River	LOCATION	and into the
Lukuga River	LOCATION	, when the author was forced to turn back by serious illness .

		An elaborate map of a part of the
Congo Basin	LOCATION	adds to the value of the work .

		As a mighty hunter and fisher , Mr.
Abel Chap	PERSON	- man has ranged
Western Europe	LOCATION	from
South Spain	LOCATION	to
Spitzbergen	LOCATION	, and has written several accounts of his experiences , the present volume , `` Wild Nor - way , '' being the fourth and last of the series .

		Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	is of the best type of English big-game hunter .

		He is no butcher , but takes an intelligent interest in wild animals , and is a close student and fervent admirer of all wild life .

		He is a seeker of trophies , and obtains splendid specimens of reindeer and elk heads ; but he also has an interest in smaller animals , as witness this account of the lemming : '' If his powers were proportioned to his pluck , the lemming would make things lively for the hunter .

		Had the bear , the lynx , or the mighty elk but a thousandth part of the lemming 's aggressive ferocity , the relative position of hunter and hunted would be reversed , and an expedition to the f jeld would require an advance guard of cavalry and a support of Maxim guns .

		The lemming attacks with reckless fury the harmless passer - by .

		One small creature -LRB- smaller than a rat -RRB- will assail , without second thought , a couple of human beings weighing a hundred and fifty pounds apiece ; it will spring at one 's knees , biting and barking , and in pur - blind fury fall back all-ends-up to earth , only to renew the attack again and again .

		To-day , while one lemming was flying at me , another from a small stream joined in the demonstration , presently swimming across to get to close quarters . ''

		The author 's observations on birds will have some value for the ornithologist .

		His remarks on the Norwegian peasantry , on the
Lapp	PERSON	, and on Nor - wegian scenery , are frequently of interest .

		The opening of the
Northern	LOCATION
summer	DATE	is thus mentioned : '' Leaf bursts forth on tree and shrub while one watches it ; on all sides is heard the cracking of the buds of birch and plane-trees , the unfolding of fern-fronds is well-nigh visible . ''

		The greatest de - fects of this book are its fragmentary character , and also that lack of sentiment and imagination which is a trait of most English travellers .

		The illustrations , which are drawn from life , are ex - tremely clear , accurate , and interesting .

		Professor
E. A. Freeman	PERSON	's '' Sketches of Travel in
Normandy	LOCATION	and
Maine	LOCATION	, '' as reprinted from the ``
Saturday	DATE	Review '' and the `` Guardian , '' may be considered as an appendix to his '' Sketches of French Travel , '' and as a series of notes illustrative of '' The Norman Conquest . ''

		Their interest is not so much in their accounts of travels as in their anti- quarian description and discussion ; and hence they will hardly appeal to the general reader .

		But the connoisseur of mediaeval history and architecture will find these brief papers very suggestive and in - structive , being saturated with lore , and always competent , accurate , and incisive .

		The book con - tains much information , not easily found elsewhere , concerning out-of-the way historic places in north - western
France	LOCATION	.

		In this work , as in all his works , Mr.
Freeman	PERSON	brusquely speaks his mind on all occasions .

		For instance , his remarks on '' the brutal work '' of architectural restorations is full of sav - age denunciations .

		Mr.
Freeman	PERSON	's drawings of ancient buildings will appeal more to the architect than the artist .

		The volume contains an index , but has no map .

		Quite in contrast to '' In Tolstoi Land , '' lately noticed in THE DIAL , which depicted
Russia	LOCATION	fam - ishing , we now have a book giving a picture of
Russia	LOCATION	feasting . ''

		In
Joyful Russia	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
John A. Logan , Jr.	PERSON	, is a rather highly-colored narrative of the recent coronation proceedings , and a very eulogistic account of the Imperial family .

		The author also gives some interesting notes on Russian baths , restaurants , houses , horses , etc. .

		As a sample of his descriptions , we quote his account of the netting of the famous fish , the sterlet , in
Moscow	LOCATION	restaurants . ''

		The perfection of the sterlet is so dependent upon its size and freshness that in many of the crack res - taurants of
Moscow	LOCATION	, and of a few other cities that are near enough to the
Volga	LOCATION	, a great marble basin forms the centre of the dining-room .

		This basin is three - quarters filled with limpid water water in which great aquatic plants dwell plants between whose splendid leaves magnificent sterlet dart , lifting now and again their shapely heads to catch the spray falling from the fountain , that , with a slim , straight , and then gracefully - falling shaft of water , punctuates the small pool 's centre .

		The Russian gourmet who is old enough , and the Russian gourmet who is young enough , to take a keen satisfaction in the display of his gastronomical judgment and exquisite taste goes to the marble brink of this artificial lake and nets his own sterlet .

		The waiter hands him a net , fanciful of handle and silken of web .

		He grasps it , looks critical , then wise , and thrusts it into the pool .

		If he is lucky he brings up a fish .

		If not , he tries again .

		When , sooner or later , he 1897 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 17 captures his prey , with a gesture of triumph he hands his net to the attendant and hies to his potage .

		Almost before his soup is removed , the sterlet is brought to him , dressed in any way he has ordered , and cooked to per - fection .

		I noticed that most of the travellers dining at the
Moscow	LOCATION	restaurants liked to net their own ster - let .

		I did it once .

		But it was stupid sport , and after that I always left the selection of my fish to the waiter , who understood what I did not which were the choice specimens . ''

		As a narrative of a few weeks ' trip through Rus - sia , by a young , lively , impressionable , enthusiastic American , who was most magnificently treated by Russian officialdom , this book is very pleasant and readable ; but it can not well be taken as a serious , impartial , and thorough account of the
Russia	LOCATION	of to-day , although the author expresses very strongly his decided optimistic opinions on Russian society and government .

		The style sometimes over-does itself in point of vividness , and the way in which the author frequently alludes to his mother can hardly be called in good taste .

		The photographic illustra - tions are in the main fresh and interesting , and the colored pictures are fairly successful .

		The Armenian massacre has been somewhat dis - placed in popular interest by the Turko-Greek war , yet the volume of `` Letters from
Armenia	LOCATION	, '' by Professor
J. Rendel Harris	PERSON	and Mrs.
Harris	PERSON	, will be found of considerable interest by many .

		Mr. and Mrs.
Harris	PERSON	went to
Armenia	LOCATION	in
1896	DATE	, as dispensers of an English relief fund , and these letters to friends in
England	LOCATION	relate some of their experiences .

		They fully corroborate other accounts of the Turkish and Kurdish atrocities in
Ourfa	LOCATION	,
Harpoot	LOCATION	,
Eghin	LOCATION	, and other towns ; they show the apostolic unction and fervent piety of their
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	authors , and make plain how in
Asia	LOCATION	Minor to-day , as of old , '' the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the church . ''

		The writers have the highest praise for the Ameri - can missionaries .

		As information , the letters are only very brief and sketchy .

		As to style , they have little literary quality , being mostly familiar and commonplace in tone , and sometimes careless , as '' nice talks , '' ' < met us to tea , '' etc. .

		Professor
Harris	PERSON	, who is best known as a specialist on ancient
Chris	PERSON	- tian manuscripts , made some rather ineffective search for treasures in this line .

		The book contains a route map , and some photographic illustrations .

		It is pleasant to turn from the sufferings of
Armenia	LOCATION	, and view the prosperity of a country lately Turkish , but now under Austrian rule .

		That country is
Bosnia	LOCATION	, described by Mr.
H. C. Thomson	PERSON	in his book entitled '' The Outgoing Turk . ''

		Twenty years ago
Bosnia	LOCATION	was , like
Armenia	LOCATION	to-day , a land of extortion , robbery , and massacre ; but now , thanks to the enlightened administration of
Austria	LOCATION	, she can be depicted as a land of peace and prosperity .

		Our author visited not only the main cities , but also the remoter districts , and gives a careful and trust - worthy account of the social and industrial status of the inhabitants , throwing much light on the former
Mohammedan	DATE	government .

		The main cause of the Turkish misrule everywhere is , as he points out , the autocratic power of the Sultan , by which favorites are appointed to govern provinces , and a thorough - going spoils system is established .

		A subsidiary cause is the fact that the methods of modern com - mercial success are debarred the true
Mohammedan	DATE	, and he must turn to brute force to maintain himself in the luxury he loves . ''

		And there are many things to make it hard for a conscientious
Mohammedan	DATE	to succeed in business .

		His religious observances alone take up so much valuable time .

		Five times a day he must go to the mosque to pray .

		How is it possible for a man to compete with others , in the face of such interruptions as that ?

		More - over , the whole teaching of the Koran is against the spirit of modern trade .

		So , too , is that of Christianity .

		But , as a rule , in commercial matters , Mohammedans conform to what their religion teaches them , while the Christians frequently do not .

		Certain precepts of the Prophet have moulded the lives of his followers , and purified their every-day dealings .

		All over
Bosnia	LOCATION	, a
Mohammedan	DATE	's word may be trusted in matters of buy - ing and selling .

		He is bloodthirsty and treacherous and cruel , but he will not lie or cheat or steal .

		Go into the
Carcija	LOCATION	in
Serajevo	LOCATION	, and buy from a Christian or a Jew , and you must haggle with him , for you may be sure that he will ask you three or four times the proper price ; but it is not necessary to do so when you are buying from a Turk , for he will ask you only the real value of what he is selling . ''

		Mr.
Thomson	PERSON	made some incursions into
Herce	PERSON	- govina ,
Dalmatia	LOCATION	, and
Slavonia	LOCATION	, and gives a few observations on these countries .

		He concludes his valuable work with a general review of the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	question and a vigorous arraignment of English policy .

		The book contains some good maps , and the illustrations are admirably clear , serviceable , and artistic .

		`` A Ride Through Western
Asia	LOCATION	, '' by
Clive Big	PERSON	- ham , is a summary sketch of a rapid trip through
Asia	LOCATION	Minor ,
Persia	LOCATION	,
Central Asia	LOCATION	to
China	LOCATION	, and back by way of
Siberia	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	.

		The jottings on the earlier journeys seem somewhat perfunctory ; but the author shows greater interest in his Central Asian travels , and gives some useful information about Russian progress there .

		He notes that '' Rus - sia does not colonize in the sense that
England	LOCATION	does ; she annexes and absorbs .

		In a comparatively short time after she has occupied a country and subdued the inhabitants , that country becomes an integral part of
Russia	LOCATION	and the inhabitants try to become Russians . ''

		The power of
Russia	LOCATION	lies in its militiarism , with the Czar at its head , who is prac - tically a deity to his people .

		Away to the northwest frontier of
China	LOCATION	, at
Vierny	LOCATION	, Mr.
Bigham	PERSON	and com - panion attended a service at the
Basilica	LOCATION	on the '' Imperial Name-Day . '' ''

		We went into the church with an officer , and found it full of men in uniform .

		The Imperial prayer was being sung .

		The Bishop was standing on the altar steps making genuflexions , while a priest in the centre of the clmrch was chanting the prayer , his voice rising higher and higher as it proceeded .

		When he reached the last triumphant clause , '
Nicholas	PERSON	, son of
Alexander	PERSON	, 18 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, Emperor of All the Russias , ' the choir and congrega - tion joined in , the trumpets blared , and outside the field-guns boomed out one after the other .

		The effect was so splendid that one felt as if at a momentary glimpse the power of
Russia	LOCATION	was suddenly revealed . ''

		Mr.
Bigham	PERSON	's account in general is too cursory , superficial , and matter-of-fact to be distinctly inter - esting ; though it is evidently trustworthy as far as it goes .

		The book is provided with useful maps and illustrations .

		RECENT FICTION .

		* It has often seemed surprising to us that the novelist , in his eager search for unexploited romantic material , should have made so little of one of the most interesting phases of the history of nineteenth - century
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The story of the Italian revolu - tionary movement , from the intrigues of
Young Italy	LOCATION	to the definitive setting of the seat of govern - ment upon the Quirinal , is full of such incidents as the novelist most desires , and is informed by motives of the sort that best lend themselves to the purposes of romantic fiction .

		The subject , as a whole , is hardly inferior to that of the French Revo - lution , yet the latter has furnished forth ten times as many historical novels as the former .

		The author of '' The Gadfly , '' then , in taking for his theme the Italian conspiracies of the thirties and forties , has had the advantage of dealing with comparatively unhackneyed material , and we trust that his novel may be the forerunner of many others that shall deal with the same stirring period .

		Who Mr.
E. L. Voynich	PERSON	may be we can not say , but we have no hesitation in asserting that his novel is one of the strongest of the year , vivid in conception and dra - matic in execution , filled with intense human feel - ing , and worked up to a tremendously impressive * THB GADFLY .

		climax .

		The hero is a person whose life has been hopelessly embittered by deceit practiced upon his youth , and whom fierce sufferings , both physical and mental , have transformed from a dreamy and confid - ing boy into a reckless and cynical man , whose watch - word is the Voltairean ecrasez I ` infdme , and who throws himself heart and soul into the struggle against priestcraft and tyranny .

		The book is ex - tremely outspoken at times , and will probably give to many of its readers the same sort of offence that is given , let us say , by such a poem as Mr.
Swin	PERSON	- burne 's '' Before a Crucifix . ''

		The note of revolt is certainly very insistent and very shrill .

		Those who have a sense of the stern realities that underlie even the most traditionally sacred conventions of life will be able to enter into the spirit of this book and share the mood of the author ; those who have not that sense will probably read it with suspicion and shudder at its denouement .

		In '' A Rose of Yesterday , '' Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	pre - serves the unity of time in a rather remarkable way .

		The entire novel of more than two hundred pages is concerned with the happenings of a single day .

		These happenings , as may be surmised , are mostly conversations , and Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	's skill in the man - agement of dialogue is too well known to need further emphasis .

		The subject of the talk is divorce , and the book is little more than a lengthy plea for the sanctity of the marriage relation , sometimes made by the heroine herself , sometimes by the au - thor in those disquisitions which he never hesitates to introduce when padding is needed .

		Mr.
Craw	PERSON	- ford 's facility in composition sometimes degenerates into mere carelessness , as in his description of '' a young woman in black , '' who '' received the pay - ments of passing customers with a grieved manner . ''

		The book is a very tame performance , and adds nothing to the reputation of the author as a serious novelist . ''

		The Falcon of Lange * ac '' -LRB- but why the accent ? -RRB-

		is a story of the type made familiar by Mr.
Stanley Weyman	PERSON	and other romancers of that school .

		The scene is partly in
Brittany	LOCATION	and partly in
Mont St. Michel	LOCATION	, the time that of
Francis I. Historically	PERSON	, the book has been adorned with much conscientious detail , and while the plot shows slight powers of invention , the general effect is pleasing , an effect produced in large measure by the purity of the style .

		Mrs.
Whiteley	PERSON	is to be congratulated upon a piece of honest workmanship , imbued with the true romantic spirit , and provided with the most picturesque of settings .

		There is a wealth of picturesque and romantic material for the novelist in the life of
Spanish America	LOCATION	, and the field is as yet almost wholly un - worked .

		Mr.
Richard Harding Davis	PERSON	, in realizing the possibilities of this field , and in qualifying him - self for its cultivation by personal observation , has been enabled to produce a book that combines fresh - ness of interest with the excellent literary qualities otherwise to be expected of his work .

		His new '' Soldiers of Fortune '' is one of the most readable
1897	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 19 and entertaining books of the season .

		Its chief characters are North Americans interested in a min - ing concession obtained from the government of
Olancho	LOCATION	, which lively little Republic appears to be situated somewhere on the coast near
Venezuela	LOCATION	.

		There is a fine revolutionary scrimmage in which the American hero gets mixed up , and as romantic a love-story as the youngest of readers could wish for .

		Indeed , the book appeals to uncritical youth rather than to adult sobriety , for the former is un - mindful of flaws that might easily mar the enjoy - ment of the latter , and a sort of irrepressible boy - ishness is the chief note of the narrative .

		Mr.
M. Bourchier Sanf	PERSON	ord has found the material for an interesting narrative in the history of the Jesuit mission to the Hurons in the middle of the seventeenth century .

		The scene of the story is in the region which includes Sainte-Marie and
St. Ignace	LOCATION	, and the authorities for the historical part of the romance are , of course , the '' Relations des Je ` suites , '' as filtered through the pages of
Parkman	LOCATION	.

		The story is full of sympathy for the devotion and the heroism of the Jesuit fathers who spent laborious lives in the wilderness , and who shrank from no hardship and no danger in the performance of their task .

		In its ' earlier chapters , the book is deficient in vitality , and it is not until near the close that the dry bones of historical fact are made to live in a narrative that engages our interests .

		The story has the same sort of charm that we find in Mrs. Gather - wood 's work dealing with similar material , and is informed throughout by the loftiest ideals of conduct . ''

		The Mutable Many '' is a story that shows the hand of the trained journalist rather than the hand of the man of letters .

		There is no style to speak of , no genuine analysis of character , and but slight sense of the demands of literary art .

		But there is instead abundant action that does not flag , and a thoughtful presentation of a great social problem .

		There have been many other novels dealing with the conflict between labor and capital , but few that have done such even-handed justice to both aspects of the controversy , or that have produced the impression of being so closely in touch with the machinery of production , on the one hand , of strikes and labor organizations on the other .

		It is a far cry from '' Put Yourself in His Place , '' for example , to this up-to-date study of a similar subject .

		The funda - mental passions concerned are much the same , but the conditions and the methods are so different now that
Reade	ORGANIZATION	's novel is a matter of ancient history .

		Perhaps the best of Mr.
Barr	PERSON	's characters is the artist in his own conceit , who plays but a minor part in the narrative , but whose appearance the reader soon learns to welcome .

		We are told at the start that
Barney	ORGANIZATION	is a cad , and he probably is , but the epithet is inadequate , and we end with a real liking for him .

		Mr.
Barr	PERSON	's method of story-telling sug - gests that of Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	in its breeziness and its actuality , thus deriving , in a measure , from
Dickens	LOCATION	himself .

		Entertainment , at least , may safely be promised the purchaser of this book .

		Mr.
Frankfort Moore	PERSON	has been studying to good effect the manners and literary history of eighteenth - century
England	LOCATION	, and has turned out two books that are honestly , and almost brilliantly , written . ''

		The Jessamy Bride '' has
Goldsmith	PERSON	for its central figure , and his romantic attachment for
Mary Horneck	PERSON	for its theme .

		This part of the story is sweet , tender , and pathetic , and one can hardly read with dry eyes the closing pages , with their record of
Goldsmith	ORGANIZATION	's death .

		The famous production of '' She
Stoops	PERSON	to Conquer '' forms a leading episode of the work , and thereby introduces us to the pleasant company of the player-folk .

		Besides these
Garrick	PERSON	,
Colman	PERSON	, and Mrs.
Abington	PERSON	we have sketches of the other people in
Goldsmith	PERSON	's immediate circle , of
Burke	LOCATION	,
Reynolds	PERSON	,
Boswell	PERSON	, and the redoubtable Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	.

		There is nothing better in the whole volume than the scene -LRB- in one of the early chapters -RRB- in which
Garrick	PERSON	, disguised as a country clergyman , imposes upon the little group of
Goldsmith	PERSON	's friends , and administers such a snub to the author of the ''
Dic	ORGANIZATION	- tionary '' that we can not help sharing in the awe - stricken mood of the hearers .

		Mr.
Moore	PERSON	has imitated the ponderous Johnsonian manner with marked success , and has limned the other historical characters with much verisimilitude .

		His task was a daring one , but it is at least not so ill-performed as to make us regret the attempt .

		Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's other book is a collection of six short stories , having for their leading figures such historical personages as the uxorious Duke of
Marlborough	LOCATION	and his wife ,
Nell Gwyn	PERSON	,
Kitty Clive	PERSON	,
Peg Woffington	LOCATION	, and
Sarah Siddons	PERSON	.

		The stories are well-conceived and amus - ing , bearing upon every page the impress of an intimate study of the fascinating period wherein they are laid .

		Mr.
William J. Locke	PERSON	, the author of '' Derelicts , '' is credited upon the title-page with two other nov - els , which we do not remember to have seen , but which we should certainly be glad to read if they in any measure approach his present performance .

		There is nothing novel about '' Derelicts , '' either in plot or construction , and merely to summarize the story would give no notion of the true value of the book .

		The qualities that make it really noteworthy are the crystal purity of its style , the strength of its characterization , the delicacy and refinement of its motives , and its careful poise above the danger - ous depths of sensationalism on the one side , and sentimentalism on the other .

		It affords a sympa - thetic portrayal of warm human life , neither too idealized to lack substance , nor led too far astray into the thickets of realism to lose its distinctive character as artistic work .

		In theme , it is a study of guilt and expiation of a guilt that derives from weakness rather than from vicious predispo - sition , and of an expiation that is not merely exter - nal , but takes the form of a gradual and genuine upbuilding of character .

		It is not as strong a book , or as consummate a piece of workmanship , as Mr.
Allen	PERSON	's `` The Choir Invisible , '' but we can not refrain from bringing the two books into juxtaposition , for 20 THE DIAL , -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, the author of one would understand the other , and both are refreshing and purifying in their influence .

		A few more such hooks as these would suffice to turn the stream of current fiction into channels less muddied than those in which it has been running of late years .


William Massarene	PERSON	was an American from Da - kota .

		He was described in the vernacular of the northwest as '' a bull-dozing boss , '' and enjoyed the soubriquet of the '' Blasted Blizzard . ''

		He was an Irishman by birth , but emigrated to '' the States '' early in life , and amassed a colossal fortune by dis - reputable means .

		Having made his '' pile , '' he crossed the
Atlantic	LOCATION	and set about the conquest of English society .

		Of his success in this noble ambi - tion we may read at great length in the latest work of fiction to bear the name of '' Ouida '' as its author . ''

		The Massarenes '' is , like most of the imaginings of that ingenious writer , a curious mixture of strength , cleverness , vulgarity , and pretentious igno - rance .

		Its good qualities save it from utter condem - nation ; its bad qualities are beneath contempt .

		In the predominance of the latter , it is something of a reversion to the author 's older and worse manner , and its general tone of exaggerated sensationalism is quite unworthy of her .

		No one will be convinced that English society is so essentially corrupt as she would have us think , and no one will take very seriously her impossible '' Mouse '' and her equally impossible
Lord Hurstmanceaux	PERSON	.

		There are so many misprints in the book that we must be care - ful about ascribing to '' Ouida '' all of the curious things that meet the eye ; it is possible that the printer is responsible for '' the congenial country of mug-wamps and roarbacks , '' and even for `` smelted gold , '' but even the printer could not have invented such bad French as '' des bons gens . '' ''

		The Fascination of the King '' is an entertaining story of imaginary politics , the scene being laid in some unknown region of the
Far East	LOCATION	, and the hero being a European adventurer who has created a new
State	ORGANIZATION	and made himself ruler thereof .

		How his throne is assailed , and how , with the help of some English friends , he quells the conspirator and repulses the foreign foe , are matters that are made highly exciting by Mr.
Boothby	PERSON	's facile and prac - tised pen .

		The book is one of the lightly read and easily forgotten , but will serve for the occupation of a pleasant hour or two .

		The story of a sensitive nature , given up alter - nately to religious aspiration and debauchery , trying various ways of life , and making but poor success of them , is what we are given in '' The Fool and His Heart . ''

		The story has neither symmetry of design nor distinction of style , and although the hero , in his better moods , appeals to our sympathies , his waywardness and weakness of will prevents us from greatly caring what becomes of him .

		The book derives a certain interest from the glimpses which it affords of the Catholic schools in which the hero is educated , and from the semi-Bohemian episodes of his subsequent career as a struggling novelist .

		But the execution as a whole is slovenly , and the ethical tone disheartening . ''

		Christine of the Hills '' is the story of a girl of
Dalmatia	LOCATION	, endowed with beauty and musical talent , who marries a brutal peasant before she knows what marriage means , and afterwards , believing her husband to have been shot , gives her heart to a nobleman who has befriended her .

		Presently the husband reappears , drags his reluctant wife away to
Vienna	LOCATION	, and lives upon her earnings as a singer .

		Mr.
Max Pemberton	PERSON	has told this story prettily enough , but he is never quite successful in creating a strong situation , or in giving vitality to his pup - pets .

		The book is saved from insipidity by its romantic atmosphere and by the fascinating Dal - matian setting of its scene .

MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS .

		Mr.
Bradnock Hall	PERSON	's `` Fish-Tails .

		f ~ and Some True Ones -LRB-
Edward Arnold	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a seasonable little book , wherein the author tells some good fishing yarns and chats pleasantly about his own angling experi - ences in
Great Britain	LOCATION	and
Norway	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Hall	PERSON	, as we gather , is an
M.P.	LOCATION	, with a distressing , and , as he claims , undeserved , reputation for an almost puritanical sobriety .

		To this reputation he is , as a public man , of course obliged to live up .

		In sup - port of it , he has even put forth a book on ''
Bimet	PERSON	- allism as a Panacea for Pauperism '' a dreary chef d'ceuvre which , he believes , nobody has ever read , and which he plainly regards with loathing .

		He is , in fact , a slave to his reputation as a serious man .

		The harmless relaxations of others would be re - garded as breaches of propriety in him lapses which might cost him his reputation and his seat in the
House	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		I must not , '' he complains , '' be absent from my place in church , I must not play golf on
Sunday	DATE	, I must eschew clay pipes and beer , and books which others read with interest and enjoy - ment must not lie upon my table : in fact , I have to eat , drink , smoke , and read to order , and to travel three hundred miles to find a desert place to laugh in . ''

		In this country we do not regard our legislators so seriously .

		Fancy anybody here re - garding his '' Congressman , '' or even his Senator , as necessarily and ex officio a paragon !

		Mr.
Hall	PERSON	admits that in private , and when he feels sure no - body is looking , he shakes off his shackles .

		In the safe retirement of his library he relaxes , indulges in refreshing and unhallowed pranks as
Richard Swiveller	PERSON	used to relieve his feelings by stealthily flourishing a ruler over the head-dress of
Miss Brass	LOCATION	, when that maiden was safely engrossed with an Eject - ment or a Writ of Replevin .

		Mr.
Hall	PERSON	's pranks have usually taken a literary form . ''

		Oh , '' he ex - claims , '' that you could have seen my Post-obiter
1897	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 21 Dicta , or my Laughable Lyrics , by a Liliputian Laureate ! ''

		Some of these trifles have even been surreptitiously published among them the papers embraced in the volume before us .

		They are , says the author , '' some of the least trivial and the least slangy of their fellows . ''

		We find them crisp , readable , and chatty enough , and well suited to leaven the writer 's undeservedly grievous reputa - tion .

		They are accompanied by some passable washed drawings by Mr.
T. H. McLachlan	PERSON	, and there is an etched plate by the author .

		The Amer - ican '' brother of the angle '' will do well to slip Mr.
Hall	PERSON	's little book in his satchel when next he goes a-fishing .

		A satirical Very chatty and piquant is the little French observer book entitled '' A Diplomat in Lon - /
London	LOCATION	life .

		don -LRB- H olt -RRB- , translated from the French of
M. Charles Gavard	PERSON	.

		The author was , from
1871	DATE	to
1877	DATE	, a member of the
French Embassy	ORGANIZATION	at
London	LOCATION	, first as Chief Secretary , and then as Minister Plenipotentiary acting as Charge d 1 Affaires .


M. Gavard	PERSON	was a notably shrewd and withal slightly satirical observer .

		His official posi - tion gave him opportunities scarcely second to those enjoyed by our courted fellow-countryman , Mr.
Smalley	PERSON	, for studying at close range the smartest of
England	LOCATION	's '' smart set . ''

		That he made good use of those opportunities , his notes and letters amus - ingly attest .

		M.
Gavard	ORGANIZATION	's attitude , we may add , toward what '' Mr.
Guppy	PERSON	's '' fashionable friend '' Mr.
Jobling	PERSON	'' termed a '' swanlike aristocracy '' is by no means so deferential as is Mr.
Smalley	PERSON	's .

		The habitual note of unctuous reverence , tinged with respectful familiarity , which pervades Mr.
Smalley	PERSON	's reminiscences is not apparent in
M. Gavard	ORGANIZATION	's sprightly and rather caustic pages .

		Of the two writers , it is seemingly the Frenchman who is the better republican .

		Mr.
Smalley	PERSON	displays at times a strong Tory , almost a Jacobitical , bias ;
M. Gavard	PERSON	can speak of Royalty itself in a most unconcerned way .

		He glances merely en passant at Mr.
Smalley	PERSON	's friend the Prince as '' a man of pleasure , a heavy drinker , a great eater , impecunious , '' and so on .

		He paints the Queen as '' fat and short , with a dis - contented-looking face , '' and certainly no one familiar with the stock cuts in the
London	LOCATION	weeklies showing a stout , dissatisfied matron looking on crossly at the laying of this or that corner-stone or the genuflections of this or that
Lord Mayor	ORGANIZATION	, will impeach the truth of his description .

		M. Gavard , like most Frenchmen , is disposed to make merry over English art .

		The older men he can endure , despite contrasts of color that remind him '' of toast-and-jam . ''

		As for the moderns , he says , '' molasses candy if that 's what you like , there you have it , and there the mob stays ; I was liter - ally sick . ''

		At an '' afternoon '' at Lady
Burdett	PERSON	-
Coutts	PERSON	's
M. Gavard	PERSON	saw a masterpiece '' represent - ing two thick-booted legs in air , incomprehensible and mediocre from the point of view of art . ''

		As with painting , so with music .

		At one entertainment
M. Gavard	PERSON	records that he was regaled with the bag - pipes . ''

		Nothing is impossible , '' he concludes , '' in this absurd country . ''

		The impressions of this cul - tivated and observant Frenchman as to English poli - tics , art , manners , and humors , are graphic and amus - ing , and , in their light way , instructive .

		M. Gavard is very frank the more so , doubtless , as he clearly had no idea that his jottings would one day find their way into print .

		There are many matters of interest ind C cMecHng .

		that cluster about art which really have nothing to do with it as art .

		Just as an immense mass of scholarship gathers around every great name in literature , so there has gathered about the various fine arts , in the narrower meaning of the term , an immense mass of anecdot - age and gossip and technical information that is often very amusing and entertaining .

		Mr.
Frederick S. Robinson	PERSON	, in his book on '' The Connoisseur '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , has put together eighteen interesting chapters touching artists and works of art .

		The word '' connoisseur '' is a good one , for it means '' one who knows . ''

		Connoisseurs are the cherubs of art , i. e. , the second order in the hierarchy ; the seraphs , or those who love , coming first .

		Mr.
Rob	PERSON	- inson is deeply interested and widely informed .

		It is true that he does not seem really to apprehend the essential character of his subject , for he begins with the inquiry , '' What do lovers of art collect ? ''

		The real answer is that , as lovers of art , they collect nothing .

		When they collect , they become collectors or connoisseurs : not those who love , but those who know .

		This minor matter aside , however , Mr.
Robinson	PERSON	will be allowed to write of collecting on a good large scale ; and some of his early chapters arouse a fine glow of pleasure .

		When he comes to
Pliny	LOCATION	and
Vasari	PERSON	he seems to us not so happy ; for he can hardly be said to give , even remotely , an accurate idea of the work of either .

		If one is going to know about Pliny , one should begin , we think , by knowing something as to what it really was that he got together in his chapters on art .

		And as to
Vasari	PERSON	, it is well to know that although he was a most estimable man , his work has drawbacks as a foundation for study .

		The chapters on Gems , how - ever , on Jewels , and on the
Goldsmith	PERSON	and Silver - smith , do give us something of an idea of those very attractive minor arts .

		And the book as a whole is one which art-lovers will doubtless read with pleasure , although it can hardly be said to include a single artistic idea .

		We should like to see the admir - able little series of biographies of `` Women of Colonial and Revolu - tionary Times , '' now issuing from the press of Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons , placed within reach of every American woman .

		The books have the right ring .

		Their tone is sympathetic , yet critical ; they are evidently the fruit of patient reflection and re - search .

		They present in a concise and attractive way facts which a true American woman should 22 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, blush to be ignorant of .

		Patriotism needs , as it craves , a past of its own a national Golden Age of exemplary deeds and virtues , a heroic era which looms larger through the mists of time .

		It is not enough to feed the imagination on the annals of
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	.

		That
America	LOCATION	too has a past to be proud of , that American women need not look abroad for patterns of high conduct in the day of trial , these beautiful little volumes abundantly attest .

		The latest of the set is Mrs.
Anne Hollingsworth Wharton	PERSON	's ''
Martha Washington	PERSON	. ''

		Mrs.
Whar	PERSON	- ton 's fluent and animated pen shows no signs of flagging ; and she has really succeeded in the diffi - cult task of making her worthy , if not in herself very brilliant or distinguished , heroine the chief figure of her own biography .

		One closes the book with a clear impression of
Martha Washington	PERSON	as a distinct and not inconsiderable personality a stanch and devoted Virginian lady who decidedly counted for something even when viewed apart from her illustrious husband .

		To the high enter - prise of which he was the soul , and of which he re - mains the most splendid figure , she gave ungrudg - ingly all she had to give .

		Her counsels must have assisted in shaping his conduct ; and his conduct was singularly beyond reproach .

		Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	's portrait of her is painstaking and truthful a real portrait , and not a fancy sketch of the conventional '' Lady
Washington	LOCATION	'' idealized in the spirit of a certain fad now prevalent .

		In following her hero - ine 's career , Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	gives us incidentally some pleasing pictures of the manners of the time , notably as exemplified in the home-life of the Wash - ingtons .

		The little book is not only a capital one for popular reading : it can not fail to win the ap - proval of the more critical .

		There is an attractive portrait , after the original painting by
Woolaston	ORGANIZATION	.

		The most noteworthy characteristic * Professor Mach 's '' Contributions to the Analysis of Sensations '' -LRB-
Open Court Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the point of view by which they are inspired , rather than the facts therein re - corded or the results reached .

		It is the point of view prominent in the writings of
Helmholtz	PERSON	, and insists upon the essential unity of the underlying aspects of sensation and their causes .

		It is a point of view at once physical and psychological ; or , still better , it is the analysis of the essential nature of things underlying the methods and scope of both these sciences .

		Because physics was one science and psychology another and in many ways a totally different science , men seem to believe that the prov - inces of these two divisions of knowledge , their con - tent and fact-material , were necessarily diverse .

		Sensation is the common ground of physics and psychology , and , indeed , of physiology as well .

		The difference between these sciences , Professor
Mach	PERSON	insists , is not that they deal with totally different phenomena but that they deal with them in different ways .

		When we are discussing the objective forms of energy by which our senses may be impressed , we are physicists ; when we are analyzing the nature of the impression thus made upon us , the manner of our becoming acquainted with our environment , we are psychologists .

		The study of sensations from all possible points of view , the union of physical and psychological methods , holds out the promise of a wider and deeper insight into the true nature of sensation than would ever be possible if we hold apart what should be brought together .

		This domi - nant note of warning was more necessary , because less familiar , a dozen years ago , when the original of the present translation appeared , than it is now ; the predicted rejuvenation of interest in the study of sensation has in the main come to pass , and along the lines suggested .

		The contents of
Professor Mach	ORGANIZATION	's contributions will interest several classes of specialists , and it is a merited tribute to their inher - ent value to present them in an attractive English garb .

		It has been said of the late Professor Sylvester that in writing he stood very close to his subject , and made things large and important which others might be inclined to consider as of little consequence .

		Professor
Mach	PERSON	has the same tendency ; and in both men it is the outcome of an enviable enthusiasm for their chosen subjects , which gives to their pages a spice that is often lacking in works of pure science .

		Both in manner and in matter , the little volume is a valuable contribution to the analysis of sensations .

		No English poet is more steeped in .

		classical mythology
JJpn Spenser	PERSON	, and nowhere else can the purely E.n - glish student find so complete and attractive an exercise-book for the study of the subject as is afforded by the '' Faerie Queene . ''

		As an aid in such study ,
Miss Alice E. Sawtelle	PERSON	has compiled a dic - tionary to the '' Sources of Spenser 's Classical Myth - ology '' -LRB- Silver ,
Burdett & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , as her thesis for the doctor 's degree at
Yale University	ORGANIZATION	.

		The work seems to be very carefully done , and it is a great conven - ience to the student of Spenser to have at his hand so compact and orderly a presentation of the sub - ject , although little seems to be added to the knowl - edge presented in scattered notes by the various commentators and editors of the poet .

		We regret that Dr.
Sawtelle	PERSON	has not carried out further the too - brief general introduction to her book , even at the risk of repeating in part some of the generalizations of Jortin ,
Warton	PERSON	,
Percival	PERSON	, and other critics .

		Thus , it would be interesting to hear more in regard to such topics as the artistic methods employed by Spenser in handling his myths , the proportion of use and the sort of use made of the various classical poets , the kinds of myths he particularly affects and which he loves to elaborate , and the like .

		A serious omission in a field offering room for profitable re - search is the lack of investigation in the thesis into the subject of the coloring and the transmission of some of these myths to Spenser through the inter - mediary of the Italian literature of the Renaissance .

		We conjecture that a study of the annotations to
Tasso	LOCATION	,
Ariosto	PERSON	, and
Boiardo	PERSON	, as well as of the writ -
1897	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 23 ings of some of the Italian Platonists and humanists , would contribute to the rather scanty information now supplied us in relation to such topics as the Garden of Adonis , the story of Hippolytus and ^ Esculapius , and the dreaded name of Demogorgon .

		The last especially is a mysterious and interesting figure in literature , appearing in the verse not only of Spenser , but also of
Milton	LOCATION	,
Dryden	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	, and other English poets ; and yet the classical diction - aries and Dr.
Sawtelle	PERSON	give us very little help in regard to him .

		Besides the quotation from Dr.
Jortin	PERSON	, Dr.
Sawtelle	PERSON	might well have added the brief passage on Demogorgon from
Milton	LOCATION	's Latin writ - ings cited in
Todd	LOCATION	's
Milton	LOCATION	in the note to Paradise Lost , Book II. , line 964 .

		If easy writing makes hard reading , U * niay be that what is written at random will be read with concen - trated interest .

		The reader curious in the question may like to experiment with Mr.
L. F. Austin	PERSON	's '' At Random '' -LRB-
Ward , Locke & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Our own experience in this case was that we read the book much as it was written .

		In the last essay -LRB- if they be essays -RRB- the author tells how he met
Olivia	LOCATION	, a sparkling journalist , gazing into the window of a print-shop .

		She used to go there to look for ideas .

		Such , we fancy , must be the fate of anyone who has to write a weekly column about things in general .

		From such columns Mr.
Austin	PERSON	's book is made up , but we do not feel quite sure whither he went in search of ideas .

		Sometimes , obliviously , it was to the theatre ; sometimes it was to what he calls Mr.
Judson	PERSON	of the Dog - Licensing Department ; often he seems to have merely looked out of the window of some club .

		A few ideas he has got from
America	LOCATION	: American cider he thinks bad ; American after - dinner speeches begin during the oysters ; he was once cajoled and deceived by an American female interviewer .

		But practically his subject-matter is whatever you choose ; it is the treatment that is really the thing .

		Each number is a series of sections of about the same length , commonly of one para - graph each , with an indented heading and a few leads between every two .

		This literary form , as our readers are aware , allows the essayist much opportunity for easy badinage , good-natured satire , and quaint common-sense .

		We have already ex - pressed the opinion in these columns that such con - versation , while excellent in its weekly place , is hardly worth preserving .

		Criticism and preaching .

		In '' The Old Testament and Modern Life '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , the Rev.
Stopford Brooke	PERSON	endeavors in a se - ries of sermons to show that the modern critical view of the Old Testament is not incompatible with its use as a moral and spiritual guide for this age .

		That he has been successful in this attempt is , on the whole , questionable .

		The ideas of people in general about the application of criticism to the Old Testament are so indefinite that sermons prepared from this critical point of view have to admit too much of the apparatus of the scholar .

		The moral and spiritual emphasis is constantly weakened by acknowledgments that this or that story is mythical or legendary , or by defence and exposition of crit - ical results .

		The hearer 's degree of appreciation and the impulses toward better living are in fact limited in such a case to the influence of the person - ality of the preacher .

		When all this has been said , it remains true that such a book helps toward a truer appreciation of the Old Testament , and thus lays the foundation for more successful achievements in the same direction .

		It is especially interesting to students of the religious life of our time .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Mr.
Henry I. Sheldon	PERSON	's `` Notes on the
Nicaragua	LOCATION	Canal '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- comprise a brief descriptive account of this project by a man who has evidently made a care - ful first-hand examination of the route , and has become thoroughly convinced of both the desirability and feasi - bility of the canal .

		This book discusses the subject in all aspects , legislative , sanitary , and financial , and con - veys much useful information in a modest way .

		The volume is furnished with sketch-maps and some good illustrations .

		With commendable promptitude the second volume of Messrs.
Britton	PERSON	and
Brown	PERSON	's '' Illustrated Flora of the
Northern United States	LOCATION	,
Canada	LOCATION	, and the British Posses - sions '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- follows upon the first , which we praised in the highest terms when it appeared
last winter	DATE	.

		A third volume , soon to follow , will complete the work .

		There is little to say upon the present occasion beyond the reiteration of our former praises , and the statement that we are now taken through the Orders of the
Chori	ORGANIZATION	- petalfe -LRB- polypetalous flowers -RRB- and part way into the Gamopetalse .

		The volume before us include Orders 20 to 92 of the former series , and Orders 1 to 16 of the latter .

		The work should be in every school library , as a matter of course , and no summer house in the country , the home of an educated family , can afford to omit it from the furnishings .

		Dr.
Henry Sweet	PERSON	's '' Student 's Dictionary of
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	- Saxon '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a volume of about two hundred pages , which will serve as a makeshift pending the hoped-for completion of the exhaustive Bosworth-Toller work .

		It comes chiefly into competition with Dr.
Clark Hall	PERSON	's dictionary , which Dr. Sweet pronounced '' ter - ribly uncritical . ''

		Condensation and trustworthiness -LRB- as far as the work goes -RRB- are the objects chiefly aimed at in the preparation of the present work .

		The
Venezuelan Commission	ORGANIZATION	send us an instalment of their '' Report upon the True Divisional Line between the Republic of
Venezuela	LOCATION	and British Guiana . ''

		Two volumes are now published , one of text and one of maps .

		The text is devoted to the geography of the subject , and includes six papers , by expert writers , upon the maps of the territory in dispute .

		The accompanying atlas contains seventy-six maps , fifteen of which are new , the others being facsimile reproductions of old ones .

		As an example of book-making , this work does great credit to the
Government Printing Office	ORGANIZATION	, and stands in striking contrast to most of the productions that come from that source .

		His spirit is liberal and kindly and earnest , his literary style is limpid and charming , and his volume is sure to be more or less helpful to all .

		The book is the work of a man who is a master of clear English , who is not afraid to let himself think , and who dares to let the breath of the times blow through his pages . ''

		Chicago Tribune . ''

		It is rare that humor and pathos are so happily blended as in the personal experiences of Mrs.

		Her humor is pithy and crisp , and her pathos is of the genuine kind , rarely permitted to appear in books purporting to be autobiographical .

		The most of the problems have had classroom test .

		They add interest to the study and are helpful in making clear and fastening in the memory the principles and propositions of formal geometry .

		These problems are not to take the place of other geometries , but to be used with them ; the division into books , therefore , is made to correspond pretty closely with that of the geometries in most general use .

		No other book contains a graded set of problems on the first two books of geometry .

		Boys preparing for college will certainly take a lively interest in the questions , problems , and exercises selected from the college entrance papers , which were selected with great care , with the hope that they might prove helpfully suggestive both to teachers and pupils . ''

		52 THE TEACHING OF ENGLISH ONCE MORE .

		The teaching of English in our universities is a subject that has reached an acute phase of discussion of recent years , and in that discus - sion THE DIAL , as our readers know , has had its share .

		Still more recently , the discussion seems to have shifted its ground from the field of higher to that of secondary education , and pedagogical interest in the subject is now cen - tred upon the work of the preparatory schools and upon the admission requirements of the colleges .

		While both the theory and the prac - tice of the subject are still in a tentative and transitional state , it may be affirmed that we are at last on the way toward something like uniformity of methods and ideals , and that from the now seemingly chaotic condition of affairs something like a definite set of conclu - sions is on the way toward emergence .

		In '' The School Review '' for
June	DATE	we are provided with the means for taking as distinct a view of this important matter as it is possible at present to gain , and we propose to glance at the subject in the light of the documentary evi - dence there collected .

		The report of Dr.
A. F. Nightingale	PERSON	as Chairman of the
Denver	LOCATION	Com - mittee on
College Entrance Requirements	ORGANIZATION	, the report of Mr.
J. E. Russell	PERSON	on the subject of Requirements in English , and the report of Mr.
C. W. French	PERSON	on the English Conference of
May 31	DATE	, are the three documents upon which we have drawn , and an examination of their contents will be found both helpful and sug - gestive .

		The English Conference in question was held in
New York	LOCATION	, and the participants were a committee of fifteen delegates from the five associations of secondary schools and colleges that have played so important a part in the educational activity of recent years , and that are doing so much to make us hopeful of real progress in the matter of intermediate and higher education .

		Considerable differences of opinion were developed in the Conference , and adjournment until next
December	DATE	was had without outlining any permanent policy .

		It is interesting , however , to learn that '' the speak - ers were nearly unanimous in the opinion that there should be no difference between the reg - ular and college-preparatory courses in En - glish . ''

		The discussion was for the most part focussed upon a series of resolutions presented by Mr.
French	PERSON	.

		These resolutions called for a full four years of preparatory work , and offered a scheme for each of the four years .

		The scheme embodied one year of rhetoric and composition , one devoted to the history of the English language , and two devoted to a histor - ical survey of English literature .

		It also pro- vided for continuous essay-writing and for con - tinuous reading , both intensive and cursory , of carefully selected books .

		The resolutions also called for a settlement of college entrance requirements upon the basis of the work called for by the above scheme , and urged the adop - tion of a list '' of not less than one hundred and 36 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, fifty books '' from which preparatory schools might select the required reading for their courses .

		This last resolution , which is perhaps the most important of all , and which is certainly a step in the right direction , seemed to meet with scant favor , since about the only thing defi - nitely done by the Conference was the adoption of a brief and narrow fixed list for
1901	DATE	and
1902	DATE	, this being substantially the list hitherto adopted for
1900	DATE	.

		Dr.
Nightingale	PERSON	, who was not present at the meeting , sent a letter in ad - vocacy of what we believe to be the wiser policy of elasticity and latitude in the matter of required reading .

		This letter urges the adop - tion of long lists of books for both kinds of reading .

		Such questions as the following will not down , however conferences may try to sup - press them . ''

		Why designate a particular set for
1897	DATE	, another for
1898	DATE	, and so on ?

		Why not present a list good until
1905	DATE	, for ' read - ing ' and for ' study and practice ' out of which selections may be made according to the judg - ment of the school ? ''

		Why not , indeed ?

		The only reason which the partisans of rigidity have to offer is that college examiners would find it difficult to shape their questions with reference to such an extended list . ''

		Oh , the farce and the folly , '' Dr.
Nightingale	PERSON	exclaims , '' of shap - ing requirements for admission to college for the purpose of facilitating the making of exam - ination questions ! ''

		We are in hearty agreement with this posi - tion , and always ready to share the indignation of those who protest against rigid uniformity in anything but the veriest essentials of educa - tional policy .

		As for this particular policy of uniform reading , devised solely in the interest of the examiner , and almost fatal to the work of the instructor , it recalls nothing so much as the puerile plea of Mr.
Dingley	PERSON	in defence of his recent atrocious proposal for the taxation of knowledge .

		It will never do , he said in sub - stance , to permit books of any kind to enter the country without taxation , because we can not expect our overworked customs officials to waste their energies in determining whether books are more than twenty years old , or in what language they are printed .

		It is much simpler to clap a tax upon them all , and spare the tax-collector at the expense of all the stu - dents and readers in the land .

		Or , if this parallel be not sufficient , another may be found in Lamb 's famous essay on the economical Chinese method of roasting pig .

		Mr.
Russell	PERSON	's interesting report is largely in tabulated form , being based upon the replies to two circulars of inquiry sent to about three hundred teachers of English in the secondary schools and colleges .

		A few of the results of this investigation may be given .

		The first questions called for an opinion concerning the satisfactoriness of the present entrance require - ments , which are considered satisfactory by large majorities .

		The number of years of pre - paratory work needed to meet these require - ments is variously estimated at from one to four , the term of two years receiving the largest number of votes .

		These replies taken together seem to indicate a lower standard than should prevail .

		The preparatory work in English should certainly call for three or four years of study .

		An overwhelming majority of votes were recorded in favor of the proposition that in the selection of books for the required work , the governing principles should be : -LRB- 1 -RRB- the representation of distinct periods and types of literature , -LRB- 2 -RRB- the consideration of historical sequence , and -LRB- 3 -RRB- the equal representation of prose and poetry .

		Opinions were solicited con - cerning the fitness of the books in a list of forty-four , compiled from the actual require - ments of different colleges .

		Each book is marked as desirable , very desirable , unsatisfac - tory , or very unsatisfactory . ''

		The Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	'' is the only book in the list that does not get a single vote under the two adverse categories .

		Those that come next in accepta - bility are '' Miles Standish , '' ''
Evangeline	PERSON	, '' '' Ivanhoe , '' ''
Julius Caesar	PERSON	, '' '' The Lady of the Lake , '' ''
Marmion	PERSON	, '' '' The Sketch Book , '' and '' The Vision of Sir Launf al. '' Among the very desirable books are also '' As You Like It , '' '' Macbeth , '' and ``
Silas Marner	PERSON	. ''

		The most unsatisfactory book in the list is
Defoe	PERSON	's '' History of the Plague , '' the adoption of which by the colleges has always been a dark mys - tery .

		One hundred and seventy-eight votes are cast against it , and only thirty-seven in its favor .

		Other books that get at least fifty ad - verse votes -LRB- out of from three to five times that number -RRB- are '' Comus , '' Pope 's '' Iliad , '' '' Ly - cidas , ''
Dryden	PERSON	's ''
Palamon	LOCATION	and Arcite , '' and
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's '' Second Essay on
Chatham	LOCATION	. ''

		The majority of the books in the list are ratified by decided majorities .

		A question calling for additional suggestions elicited two hundred titles , among which
Tennyson	PERSON	's '' Idylls of the King '' received twenty-four suffrages ,
Emerson	PERSON	's '' Essays '' twenty-one ,
Franklin	PERSON	's '' Autobiography '' thirteen , '' The Deserted Village , '' '' The Essays of Elia , '' and ''
Henry 1897	PERSON	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 37 Esmond '' each twelve , and '' Hamlet '' ten .

		A second circular of inquiry sent out by Mr.
Russell	PERSON	included questions of more gen - eral scope , and elicited some interesting ex - pressions of opinion .

		The vote was almost unanimous that English should be pursued by all classes in the high school during the entire course , but opinion was about evenly divided between three , four , and five periods per week for the time allotment .

		A large majority voted for basing composition work chiefly upon the required reading .

		Exercises in paraphrasing poetry , correcting bad English , and condensa - tion were all recommended by fair majorities .

		Opinion was rather against the formal study of English literary history , and very strongly against courses in Anglo-Saxon and Early En - glish .

		Rhetoric and formal grammar as sepa - rate studies received large votes , but again opinion was very much at sea when it came to fixing the year in which these studies should best be pursued .

		Some of the questions were of such a nature that the replies to them did not admit of statistical presentation .

		In one case , for example , the replies '' show a widespread dissatisfaction with the English requirement even by those who accept it tentatively as the best possible at the present time . ''

		And the question which called for a statement of the main objects to be sought in the teaching of secondary English showed so great a diversity of opinion that we may well conclude that the real difficulty lies just here , and that we can - not expect anything but chaos in our work until we are substantially agreed upon what it is most desirable to do .

		The answers to this question ranged all the way from '' the analysis of a typical English sentence '' to a '' famili - arity with the greatest minds of all times , '' although from them all five ideals emerged in the following order of emphasis : * ' Habits of good expression , oral and written , '' '' a taste for good literature , '' '' an acquaintance with the outlines of English literature , '' '' culture and discipline , '' and '' the ability to read under - standingly . ''

		These are all worthy aims , no doubt , and if agreement can once be had upon their relative importance , we may well relegate to the limbo of the unimportant most of the other questions raised by the investigation now under consideration . ''

		If the main objects of teaching English are attained , '' to conclude our discussion with Mr.
Russell	PERSON	's most perti - nent closing inquiry , '' what matters it to the colleges , or to anyone outside of the schools , what list of books is studied ? ''

		SHAKESPEARE IN
CHICAGO	LOCATION	, II * The dramatic record of the past year in
Chicago	LOCATION	is an average one .

		It has been rather interesting to note the frequency with which adaptations of popular works of fiction have held the stage , and this tendency in dramatic productions may have some significance for one who at all studies the theatre of to-day .

		Old-time melodrama of the type represented by '' Monte Cristo '' and '' The Man in the Iron Mask , '' based on popular French romance , has held its own and shows some new development .

		To the unreasonable popularity of '' Trilby '' in its barbarous stage version of the past two seasons is undoubtedly due the attempt of Mr.
Clyde Fitch	PERSON	to reconstruct ``
Bohemia	LOCATION	'' out of Miirger 's romance . ''

		The Prisoner of Zenda '' has pursued its triumphal course , with the adaptation of Mr.
Townsend	PERSON	's ''
Chimmie Fadden	PERSON	'' as an odd competitor for pub - lic favor .

		Miss Phipps 's '' A Social Highwayman '' has achieved success in the hands of the
Hollands	LOCATION	, and Mr.
Theodore Hamilton	PERSON	's work in '' Pudd ` n - head
Wilson	PERSON	'' has won public approval .

		Mr.
Stuart Bobson	PERSON	has also made a success in the dramatization of Opie Head 's '' The Jucklins . ''

		Most interesting of all has been the appearance of Mr.
Mansfield	PERSON	in '' The Scarlet Letter , '' and that of Mrs.
Marlowe	PERSON	-
Taber	PERSON	in Mr.
Barren	PERSON	's arrangement of '' Romola . ''

		In comparing the season just closed with that of 1895-96 , we find an apparent lessening of interest in the Shakespearian drama .

		However , the season of 1895-96 was a remarkable one in this respect , and the mere falling off in the number of plays presented should not be regarded as especially sig - nificant .

		The following facts are noteworthy .

		While in the previous season eighty-eight Shake - spearian presentations are recorded , such presenta - tions number sixty-eight for the season of 1896-97 ; the number of plays staged , however , is the same in both seasons thirteen .

		``
Julius Csesar	PERSON	, '' '' Two Gentlemen of
Verona	LOCATION	, '' '' Macbeth , '' and '' Mid -
summer	DATE
Night	TIME	's Dream , '' included in the repertory of 1895-96 , were replaced by '' Much Ado About Nothing , '' '' Cymbeline , '' ''
King Lear	PERSON	, '' and '' The Tempest . '' ''

		Hamlet , '' which received twenty-six representations in the season before the last , was given but six in 1896-97 .

		`` The Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	'' also fell from a record of eleven to one of five . ''

		Othello , '' presented eight times in
1895-96	DATE	, was staged but once the past season ; a similar state - ment holds for '' The Taming of the Shrew , '' which in 1895-96 was given ten times .

		On the other hand , ''
Richard III	PERSON	. ''

		was brought out seven times in each season , while `` Romeo and Juliet '' received fourteen presentations during the past year as against four in that preceding .

		The notable fea - tures of 1896-97 were undoubtedly the revival of `` King Lear '' by
Frederick Warde	PERSON	, and that of * This article is in continuation of one in THE DIAL ol

		`` A PHILOSOPHER DECADENT . ''

		A REPLY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THIS DIAL . -RRB-

		Mr.
Camillo von Klenze	PERSON	's remarks on the translations of Volumes VIII .

		and XI .

		of the English version of
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's Works , in THE DIAL for
June 16	DATE	, can hardly be allowed to pass unnoticed .

		When approaching the end of his article , he seems to have suddenly bethought himself that it is always the proper thing for a reviewer to portion out strong doses of praise and blame .

		He deals out these articles in a great hurry , like a person who has been kept beyond his hours , and is anxious to get home .

		I happen to get the strong dose of blame .

		Of my translation , which compares at least favorably enough with the one he praises , he says , `` It is bad throughout , and in parts ignominious '' ; and after fur - nishing what purports to be a list of bad and ignominous passages , he adds , '' Such things ought never to be printed . ''

		But none of the four errors which he adduces as bad and ignominious are errors at all , except in the imagina - tion of a person in a flurried state of mind .

		He errone - ously refers to a passage as on page 9 -LRB- it is on page 19 in the English edition -RRB- , where he thinks I have com - mitted the terrible blunder of putting is instead of are .

		I insist , however , on the authority of grammarians -LRB- e. g. t Bain in his '' Higher English Grammar '' -RRB- that is is per - fectly correct in the passage , '' In his art there is mixed , in the most seductive manner , the things at present most necessary for everybody the three great stimu - lants of the exhausted . ''

		-LRB- A discussion of the same trivial question , which the ''
Saturday	DATE	Review '' justly ridicules , has been going on in a
London	LOCATION	newspaper , with reference to the expression used by Mr.
Jerome K. Jerome	PERSON	, '' A good woman 's arms ... is a life-belt . '' -RRB-

		I am further blamed for translating
Romane	PERSON	as ro - mances , which is certainly not an incorrect rendering .

		Neither is it erroneous to use the expression , `` prohibit themselves every ' if ' and for , ' '' when the Germans are spoken of in contrast to the '' aesthetic gentlemen '' who used '' if '' and '' for . ''

		-LRB- I understand that themselves is objected to , as redundant , which it certainly is not . -RRB-

		In the next passage I am blamed for preserving a metaphor by translating it literally , though not obscurely .

		Besides preserving the metaphor , the literal rendering seems best suited to the context .

		Here , however , Mr.
von Klenze	PERSON	again falls into an incidental mistake when he gives the original as '' Ich weiss nicht wo aus noch ein . ''

		The wo is redundant , and is not in the original .

		I know only too well that there are sufficient imper - fections in my translation , but in being the first to un - dertake voluntarily a difficult and important work -LRB- Dr.
Haussmann	PERSON	, the translator of the '' Genealogy of Morals , '' was the second to voluntarily undertake and complete a translation of one of
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's volumes -RRB- , I do not wish to be blamed for things which are not real errors .

		Apart , however , from his concluding paragraph , which is a curiosity in criticism , Mr.
von Klenze	PERSON	's arti - cle on
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's philosophy is valuable on the whole .

		It is an immense advance on the criticism in
Nordau	LOCATION	's '' Degeneration , '' and on some of the earlier criticisms of
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	which appeared in English -LRB- e. g. , the dis - graceful attack on Nietzsche which appeared in the '' International Journal of Ethics '' for
July , 1892	DATE	, p. 533 -RRB- .

		Surely , however , Mr.
von Klenze	PERSON	insists too dogmatically on
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's lack of the historical sense .

		The course of social development from the Renaissance to the present time is far too brief and exceptional to furnish data from which we can deduce with certainty the permanency of democratic institutions .

		Others than Mr.
John Morley	PERSON	, who believe in democratic institutions , would do well to study
Machiavelli	ORGANIZATION	, to whom , along with Thucydides ,
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	claims to be nearest akin .

		Nietzsche 's careful distinction , also , between hose -LRB- evil -RRB- and schlecht -LRB- bad -RRB- seems hardly to be grasped by Mr.
von Klenze	PERSON	.

		The word evil should therefore be substituted for bad in the passage : '' ` Good ' in other words is tantamount to harmless , ' tad ' to strong , pow - erful . ''

		We find
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	almost continually contem - plating moral phenomena of one kind or other in his voluminous writings ; it is therefore not at all correct to say , '' These revolutionary views
Nietzsche	PERSON	does not base on a careful comparative study of morality , but on the etymology of a few words . ''

		WHAT ARE `` SURVIVALS '' AND `` ARCHAISMS '' ?

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The discussion concerning the use of the verbs `` learn '' and '' teach '' reveals , as it seems to me , a surprising lack of accurate definition .

		I suppose it to be unques - tionable that the verb '' learn '' in a causative sense has had a widely extended and uninterrupted currency among English-speaking people for centuries .

		It is only the careful who consistently avoid it , and the careful are not the majority .

		Where one writer -LRB- as
Tennyson	LOCATION	-RRB- employs the construction with the English of an earlier day in mind , a thousand men , women , and children , of the masses , use it spontaneously , because with them it is the ordinary expression for the thought in mind .

		To call it either an '' archaism '' or a '' survival '' under such circumstances is to use language altogether too loosely for the purposes of philological investigation .

		May we not confine the term '' archaism '' to expressions not handed down in usage from age to age , but obtained
1897	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 39 directly from an older time across an expanse of gener - ations to which the usage was not known ?

		and is not a '' survival , '' strictly speaking , an expression which has been handed down from generation to generation in spontaneous usage , but within such narrow limits as to have escaped general attention and acceptance ?

		If I am wrong in this restriction of the terms , I am willing to be corrected ; but if there be not some such restric - tion they should be dropped from the vocabulary of philology as of no scientific value .

		MORE IJIGHT ON EARLY NORTHWESTERN HISTORY .

		* In the
Henry	PERSON	and
Thompson Journals	ORGANIZATION	, Dr.
Coues	PERSON	has found another rich store of materials such as he loves to handle .

		It is material , too , that he is admirably qualified to handle .

		No reader who has looked intelligently into the Doctor 's splendid editions of what he calls on his present title-page ''
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	'' and ''
Pike	PERSON	'' can doubt his perfect competency to edit any mass of material relating to early Northwestern affairs that , for its elucidation , demands an extensive knowledge of geography , ethnography , natural history , and of earlier or contemporary exploration and adventure in the same region .


Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	ascended the
Missouri River	LOCATION	to its headwaters , crossed the continental Divide , and then descended by the
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	to the
Pacific Ocean	LOCATION	, in the years 1804-05 .

		Pike , in 1805-06 , ascended far to - wards the sources of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	, and in 1806-07 penetrated the region southwest of the
Missouri	LOCATION	, until he found himself in Spanish territory and fell into the hands of the officers of
Spain	LOCATION	, who carried him away a prisoner into
Mexico	LOCATION	, but soon set him at liberty and per - mitted him to return to the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The
Henry	PERSON	and
Thompson	PERSON	explorations and adventures were in the regions of the
Red River	LOCATION	of the North , the Saskatchawan , the
Missouri	LOCATION	, and the
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	.

		The experiences of all these explorers and adventurers , with many points of divergence , agree in their grand features : they all extend deeply into new regions , and lay open to the world new ter - ritories previously known only to aboriginal man .

		It will be seen , also , that the ''
Henry	PERSON	and
Thompson	PERSON	'' to a degree overlaps the ''
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	'' territorially .

		The four men whose names figure in these titles were on the
Missouri	LOCATION	near the same time , and also on the
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	.

		To a great degree Dr.
Coues	PERSON	's studies of
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	fitted him directly for his present work on
Henry	ORGANIZATION	and
Thompson	PERSON	.

		The amount of exact and detailed information * NEW LIGHT ON THE EARLY HISTORY OF THE GREATER NORTHWEST .

New York	LOCATION	:
Francis P. Harper	PERSON	.

		that the editor has brought to the elucidation of these Journals will not surprise those persons who are familiar with the ''
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	'' and the ''
Pike	PERSON	. ''

		It suffices to say that the same patience , the same unwearied research , the same conscientious thoroughness , that marked the earlier works mark the present one as well .

		Dr.
Coues	PERSON	states in his preface that when he had completed his researches he found himself '' in the possession of some 4,500 memorandum cards , alphabetically arranged by subjects , and collectively constituting a sort of private cyclo - pedia of information concerning the
Northwest Company	ORGANIZATION	, the
X. Y. Company	PERSON	, the fur-trade of those days , the bourgeoise , their voyageurs and other engages , their Indian customers , their trading posts , their canoe routes and what not .

		in the way of biography , geography , eth - nography , and natural history . ''

		This vast amount of material is arranged in foot-notes to the text , and fills , if we may venture a hasty estimate , about a third of the total amount of space .

		The editor is so conscientious that he holds himself responsible for the antecedents and consequents of every person who is even named in the narrative .

		It is only rarely that we come upon a confession of inability to give some account of even the most obscure person .

		Indeed , some , if not much , of the information that is presented in these notes can never be of the slightest value to anybody , save to those specialists who may have occasion to go over the ground with a microscope .

		But these spe - cialists , we must remember , are the men for whom Dr.
Coues	PERSON	is writing .

		The work can never greatly interest the mere general reader .

		This is not because it does not contain much interesting matter , but because it is too minute , too much loaded down with unimportant things , and is wholly wanting in attractiveness of style .

		Still , for what it purports to be , and what it is , the work has great value .

		It is a modest state - ment to say , as the editor does on his title-page , that it sheds new light on the early history of the
Greater Northwest	ORGANIZATION	.

		Hitherto it has been easy to follow the steps of the explorers , traders , missionaries , and sol - diers , who first penetrated the country lying between the Lower Lakes and the
Ohio River	LOCATION	and the head of Lake Superior and the Mis - sissippi , and let in the light of day ; nor has it been difficult to follow the main lines of dis - covery and adventure that led from the
Upper Lakes	ORGANIZATION	and the
Mississippi	LOCATION	to the
Missouri	LOCATION	, the
Rocky Mountains	LOCATION	, and beyond the mountains to the Western ocean .

		But it has been diffi -
1897	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 41 cult to get other than general ideas of the con - temporaneous explorations , travels , and adven - tures by which the vast region beyond Lake Superior , west and northwest , was laid open to the knowledge of men .

		Even now , it is not easy for well-read men , at least south of the international boundary line , to grasp the fact that discovery at the North kept even pace with discovery at the South , and in some cases led the advance .

		Civilized men crossed the continent from
Canada	LOCATION	before they crossed it from the
United States	LOCATION	.

		In
1789	DATE
Mackenzie	ORGANIZATION	, starting from
Lake Athabasca	LOCATION	, followed the great river that bears his name to the frozen ocean ; and
four years later	DATE	, having crossed the Divide beyond the sources of
Peace River	LOCATION	, wrote in vermillion on a cliff overlooking the Pacific : ''
Alexander Mackenzie	PERSON	from
Canada	LOCATION	by land the
twenty-second day of July	DATE	one thousand seven hundred and ninety - three . ''

		But it was not until twelve years later that
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	, having disentangled them - selves from the mazes of the
Rocky Mountains	LOCATION	, made their way by the
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	to the ocean ; and it was not until
thirty-nine years later , 1832	DATE	, that
Schoolcraft	PERSON	discovered
Lake Itasca	LOCATION	.

		These remarks prepare the way for a proper appreciation of the
Henry	PERSON	and
Thompson Jour	PERSON	- nals .

		These writings will assist materially in pro- moting a fuller knowledge of the history of the
Greater Northwest	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Editor 's Preface , while comparatively brief , tells us plainly who
Henry	PERSON	and
Thomp	PERSON	- son were , gives a history of their journals , with their present location , and explains the methods that the editor has employed in pre - paring the material for the press .

		Henry was one of the proprietors of the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	Com - pany , and a trader .

		He is sometimes known as
Alexander Henry the Younger	PERSON	, and was the nephew of the Elder of the same name who is associated with the famous massacre at
Mackinaw	ORGANIZATION	.


Thompson	PERSON	, the editor explains , '' was a celebrated astronomer , geographer , ex - plorer , and discoverer in a word , the scien - tist , first of the
Hudson Bay Company	LOCATION	, then , during the whole period covered by
Henry	ORGANIZATION	, of the
Northwest Company	ORGANIZATION	, and later still of the
International Boundary Commission	ORGANIZATION	, which ran the line between the British Possessions and the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		Henry alone furnishes the text ;
Thompson	PERSON	goes into the foot-notes along with the editor himself .

		Mention of the preface suggests the serious criticism that we have to make on Dr.
Coues	PERSON	's editing .

		This is that he should not have prefixed to his work an introduction giving a rapid gen - eral account of the progress of discovery in the
Greater Northwest	ORGANIZATION	from the very first down to
1799	DATE	, or at least have given a view of the exist - ing state of affairs at the time when
Henry	PERSON	comes upon the scene .

		It is true that much of this information will be found in the notes , but in a scattered form .

		Such an account or view would have been of much assistance to nearly every reader who will turn these pages .

		Part III. , '' The
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	, '' brings us upon the headwaters of some interesting American history .


David Thompson	PERSON	, we are told , was not only the discoverer of the Saskatchawan and Athabascan passes over the
Continental Divide	ORGANIZATION	, and of the sources of the
Columbia River	LOCATION	and all the country of its headwaters and upper tributaries , but he was the first white man who ever descended the great river to the confluence of
Lewis	PERSON	's Fork or
Snake River	LOCATION	.

		On arriving at this point ,
Thompson	PERSON	took formal possession of the whole region in the name of the British Crown .

		Dr.
Coues	PERSON	quotes the following memorandum from
Thompson	PERSON	's Journal : ''
July 9	DATE	,
Tuesday	DATE	, -LSB-
1811	DATE	-RSB- ... \ a mile to the Junc - tion of the Shawpatin -LSB- Snake -RSB- River with this the
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	, here I erected a small
Pole	LOCATION	, with a half Sheet of Paper well tied about it , with these words on it Know hereby that this country is claimed by
Great Britain	LOCATION	as part of its territories , and that the
N. W. Company of Merchants	ORGANIZATION	from
Canada	LOCATION	, finding the fac - tory for this people inconvenient for them , do hereby intend to erect a Factory in this Place for the Com - merce of the Country around .


D. Thompson	PERSON	. ''

		Another interesting f actis that
Henry	PERSON	arrived at
Astoria	LOCATION	about a month before it was trans - ferred , along with
John Jacob Astor	PERSON	's other property , to British hands .

		This is
Henry	ORGANIZATION	's formal account of the transaction : ''
Dec. 13th	DATE	.

		-LSB-
1813	DATE	-RSB- .

		The Dolly had anchored oppo - site the fort ; before daybreak we got the powder on shore , and at 8 a. m. saluted the captain with seven guns .

		Mr.
Verdier	PERSON	, midshipman , four marines , and three seamen from the Raccoon , came ashore , having hauled the Dolly near the wharf .

		At 3 p. m. we fired three guns as a signal to the Racoon , and then hoisted the
Union Jack	ORGANIZATION	given us by the Captain .

		We collected all our men , armed with muskets ; the marines were drawn up in uniform under arms , and the sailors with Quartermaster Hill attended to the guns .

		The captain , in full uniform , broke a bottle of
Madeira	LOCATION	on the flag - staff , and took possession of this country and place in , the name of
His Britanic Majesty	ORGANIZATION	, calling this post
Fort George	LOCATION	.

		Three cheers were given by us all , and three rounds of musketry were then fired by our men and the marines .

		One of the latter had a narrow escape from shooting himself in the face , his gun having flashed and then gone off on being grounded .

		Eleven guns were fired from our four-pounder .

		We drank His Majesty 's health , and a speech to
Comcomly	ORGANIZATION	's son -LSB- was made by 42 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, Mr.
Franchere	PERSON	-RSB- .

		The ceremony ended by taking a few extra glasses of wine . ''

		*
Henry	PERSON	was not a traveller or an explorer properly so-called , but a business man intent on gain .

		He had a keen eye for the savage humanity that he saw around him , and does not mince his words when describing the miser - able beings that they were .

		Their drunken - ness , filth , thievery , murders , licentiousness , and superstitions are told in the most realistic fashion .

		Still , justice is done to such good qualities as the Indians had .

		Such a passage as the following , showing to what an acuteness the human senses may be cultivated , should delight the souls of some of our sense-realistic educators . ''

		We had not gone far from the house before we fell upon the fresh tracks of some red deer , and soon after discovered the herd in a thicket of willows and poplars ; we both fired , and the deer disappeared in different directions .

		We pursued them , but to no purpose , as the country was unfavorable .

		We then returned to the spot where we had fired , as the Indian suspected that we had wounded some of them .

		We searched to see if we could find any blood ; on my part I could find tracks , but no blood .

		The Indian soon called out , and I went to him , but could see no blood , nor any sign that an animal had been wounded .

		However , he pointed out the track of a large buck among the many others , and told me that from the manner in which this buck had started off , he was certain the animal had been wounded .

		As the ground was beaten in every direction by animals , it was only after a tedious search that he found where the buck had struck off .

		But no blood was seen until , passing through a thicket of willows , he observed a drop upon a leaf , and next a little more .

		He then began to examine more strictly , to find out in what part of the body the animal had been wounded ; and judging by the height and other signs , he told me that the wound must have been somewhere between the shoulder and neck .

		We advanced about a mile , but saw nothing of the deer , and no more blood .

		I was for giving up the chase ; but he assured me the wound was mortal , and that if the animal should lie down he could not rise again .

		We proceeded two miles further , when , coming out upon a small open space , he told me the animal was at no great distance , and very probably in this meadow .

		We accordingly advanced a few yards , and there we could see the deer lying at the last gasp .

		The wound was exactly as I had been told .

		The sagacity of the Saulteurs in tracing strong wood animals is astonishing .

		I have frequently witnessed occurrences of this nature ; the bend of a leaf or blade of grass is enough to show the hunter the direction the game has taken .

		Their ability is of equally great service to war-parties , when they discover the footsteps of their enemies . ''

		Two good maps are found in the pocket .

		The principal one is entitled `` Map of the
Northwest Territory of the Province of Canada from Actual Surveys	ORGANIZATION	during the years
1792	DATE	- * The `` Dolly '' was a small craft that Mr.
Aster	PERSON	's people had just built for their trade ; the `` Raccoon , '' a British armed vessel that had come into the river a few days before .

		1812 , '' and is attributed to
Thompson	PERSON	.

		Some section maps introduced into the body of the work would have been of much value to the reader .

		The carefully prepared Index fills a hundred double-column pages .

		The ''
Henry	PERSON	and
Thompson	PERSON	'' is brought out by Mr.
Harper	PERSON	in the same admirable style as the ''
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	'' and
Pike	PERSON	. ''

		HINSDALE .

		THE SECRET OF THE EAST .

		* There is now on many a bookshelf a certain lot of tattered , may be , and well-thumbed books of various appearance which is gradually being replaced by the more respectable and appro - priate set , mulberry-covered and already begin - ning to be well-known .

		They did good work , the old ones , some of them paper-covered , '' Plain Tales from the Hills '' in a roughly - printed `` Library , '' and `` The Light that Failed '' No. 1 in the
Heinemann	PERSON	and
Bales	LOCATION	- tier collection ; some of them in American editions , the two Jungle Books or '' The Seven Seas '' ; perhaps some stray Indian Railway edi - tion , '' Under the Deodars '' or '' Wee
Willie Winkie	PERSON	, '' or
Thacker , Spink & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's '' Depart - mental Ditties '' ; a motley lot , not much to look at , doubtless , but still a noteworthy set of books .

		It seems a little ungrateful to replace them , but the new ones are certainly very pleasing .

		Paper and print , of course , of the best ; other things interesting , too , the binding of the color of an old
Bokhara	LOCATION	rug , the little white medal - lions on the side with the elephant 's head and the lotus flowers , the curious pottery-pictures of Mr.
Lockwood Kipling	PERSON	, and here and there the added preface of the author .

		The first reading of the old books and the re-reading of the new ones are two different things .

		At first there was a sort of enchanting novelty ; each story as it came was something new , and one read it without bother of criticism or definition .

		Rudyard Kipling is now a per - fectly well-known element in literature , but even now not easily criticised or defined for all that .

		Nor are the '' Plain Tales from the Hills '' an obvious help in the definition .

		1897 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 43 knowing nothing of the others , is hard to say ; as it is , reading them with the others in mind , we take their most obvious quality to be smart - ness a careless , carefully-concealed knowing - ness , that is well acquainted with the great things of the world as well as the little , and which can therefore tell each story '' as it hap - pened '' with a clear appreciation of the signifi - cance of it all , whatever it be , and often with a sort of pity for those less well informed .

		Some - times , in '' Lispeth '' or ''
Tod	PERSON	's Amendment , '' it is a story of that native life of which the English in
India	LOCATION	are so complacently ignorant ; sometimes , in '' Thrown Away , '' '' Bitters Neat , '' '' Consequences , '' '' Kidnapped , '' '' A Bank Fraud , '' it is one of those strange things of life in general which people pass over with a stare , perhaps , because only an inner ring know the facts at bottom ; now and then , '' His Chance in Life , '' '' The Other Man , '' `` In Error , '' '' On the Strength of a Likeness , '' it is one of those unexplained ironies where no one really knows why it should not have been otherwise ; once or twice , '' By Word of Mouth , '' '' The Bisara of Pooree , '' it is a frankly mysterious matter that one might as well acknowledge without attempt at explanation .

		And all this strange secrecy with which
Nature	ORGANIZATION	veils its matters of true import is imitated in various absurd satiric grotesques , in which the con - cealed irony is nothing more than the exploita - tion of a germ-destroyer or the consummating of an engagement , while the secretive and avenging Nature appears in the guise of Lieu - tenant Hogan-Yale or the unscrupulous owner of Lady
Regula Baddun	PERSON	.

		All these matters are detailed with a simple directness , a complacent sententiousness , and an affectation of epigram which is wholly in keeping .

		Generally a snatch of simple-hearted cynicism ; generally a shrug of the shoulders at the end ; never any exhibition of sympathy with human passion , or interest in any indi - vidual human heart .

		And yet in this collection of cross-purposes and tragedies and whimsical - ities and clever dodges , melting down for the time the curt superiority , the unperturbed ac - quaintance with the world , the impassive inter - est in the event , are some half a dozen stories of native life , '' The Gate of the Hundred Sor - rows , '' '' In the
House	ORGANIZATION	of Suddhoo , '' '' Beyond the Pale , '' ''
Muhammad Din	PERSON	, '' which show that there is real power in all this , although not always power that understands itself .

		Still , although '' Plain Tales from the Hills '' are not an exhibition of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's full strength by any means , the book does much to give an insight into some of his later work .

		Whatever was mere smart knowingness passed away , or , more accurately , developed into a surer and truer feeling , the feeling that the real forces in life are not spread open to view , that the real thing is hidden from us , that the super - ficial is for fools ; that these hidden forces , the passions beneath the surface , which influence all men or many men , not one or two , are the matters of real fascination , the great but secret currents , which crop up here and there but are far more apt to work unseen ; that few men -LRB- and fewer women -RRB- know them , but that those who do are the worthy ones , soldiers , tramps , old beggars , outlaws , officers , or no matter what .

		If men can see beneath the surface they are men , and brothers .

		Such a feeling , at least , seems to be at the bottom of things , as we read the later volumes .

		Whence , otherwise , the greatness of
Mulvaney	ORGANIZATION	, with the unfaltering melancholy under his deep brows , a modern Odysseus without the youthful buoyancy of the Greek ?

		Could Ortheris or Learoyd have been friends of
R. K.	PERSON	had it not been for
Mulvaney	PERSON	?

		Yet being friends of
Mulvaney	ORGANIZATION	they partook at times of his high - souled woes .

		They feel , although intuitively , subconsciously , not with the direct assurance of
Mulvaney	ORGANIZATION	, that the world moves on in its own strange ways , not those mentioned in books .

		And those who see them clearly will smile , may be , at first , but after the first will rarely smile again , for on the whole , between four and twenty soldiers swimming the Irrawaddy to get into
Lungtungpen	PERSON	, and one man shooting another for interference in family affairs , there is only a difference of circumstance ; the fact in each case is that the true springs of action are as usual unknown or ignored , and that people play merrily in cooled lava which they think is rock .

		So it is with other things .

		Native
India	LOCATION	has its charm , aside from color and romance , be - cause life has gone on unchangingly for twenty centuries , according to its own unwritten laws whereof few Europeans know or care .

		The jungle fascinates one , too , because its inhabi - tants , more clever than humankind , know the laws of the life whereof they are a part .

		So children , understanding nothing perhaps , take matters far more simply with an adequate recog - nition of the springs of their simple action .

		Decent conventional society is futile enough , but those who fall from it like '' Love o ' Women '' and
Mclntosh Jellaludin	PERSON	are more patent ex - amples than anyone else .

		Such is the charm 44 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, of any life , where there is such an esprit du corps that important things may be taken for granted , whether it be the mess of a cavalry regiment , the guild of mendicants , or the scat - tered confraternity of those who go down to the sea in ships .

		Those who know and who else is worth bothering about ?

		are aware of the hidden powers of life and are thereby rendered grave .

		All the same , on the surface for men who know how to take it life is a hustling , breezy , invigorating affair .

		Take it all in the day 's work , be your task to personate an Indian God or make friends with an ele - phant , take it easily as it comes , and you will feel the blood in your body ; and a man of sense wo n't ask for much more .

		And if he keep a stiff upper-lip , never show the white feather , and be always fair and square , no one need ask any more of him .

		Realising this , and discarding or disowning the futilities and ineptitudes of conventional goings and comings , one may observe the strange things '' of Life and Death and men and women and Love and Fate , '' and take them at their worth .

		Hence the threescore tales of Soldiers Three , '' '' Military Tales , '' In Black and White , '' '' The Phantom Rickshaw . ''

		The feeling never takes direct form but it is never absent , in the rattling soldier-scrapes of
Mulvaney	LOCATION	,
Ortheris	PERSON	, and Learoyd , in the charm and color of the native episodes , in the later wonders and wanderings here and there nar - rated by soldier , sailor , or traveller .

		There is always a story or an event or a something done , save in half a dozen like `` The Amir 's Homily , '' `` The Children of the Zodiac , '' '' One View of the Question , '' '' The Enlighten - ments of
Paget	LOCATION	,
M.P.	LOCATION	, '' there is always the interest in life in action .

		And in these later volumes most of the futile charms of the '' Plain Tales '' are dropped ; the mannerisms of '' other stories '' and shrugging ending are mostly gone , while the naive cynicism and the grandstand fireworks have merged into the general point of view and a confidence in the general power of the idea .

		So we have the grateful directness and avoidance of immaterial delicacies of dic - tion .

		Told '' through the voice of one , two , or more people , '' there are thousands of details , but they all have something to do with the matter , and we get the story and are satisfied with it as a story .

		Then when we think about it afterward , it seems as though there were something more to it .

		As to the real value of all this , it is some - thing which would require a fresh discussion .

		We think it a standpoint which enables the story-teller to find stories and to compel the hearer to listen to them .

		We think it one of the secrets of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's hold on the reader .

		But we must be content with the suggestion , for there is no space here to develope it .

		And even such as it is , it does not account for Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's power of emotional phrasing , as we might call it , nor for his power as a poet , which is much the same thing thrown in a dif - ferent direction , nor for a certain discernment of general trends of emotion in this world .

		But these matters appear in the volumes now in hand , only here and there , and in a rather un - developed form , so they need not be commented upon at present .

		The paper on the Monuments of Yucatan , now before us , is the eighth in its series of printed documents , although the first in the line of Anthropology .

		In the winter of 1894-5 , Mr.
Allison V. Armour	PERSON	invited certain scientific gentlemen to make a trip with him , in his yacht '' Ituna , '' to Yucatan and
Mexico	LOCATION	.

		The three months were busily employed by all , and in this book Mr.
Holmes	PERSON	presents some of the archaeological re - sults of the trip .

		Notwithstanding all that has been written about Yucatan 's archeology , the greater part of the work still remains undone .

		No single locality has yet been completely investigated .

		Some have never been examined since
John L. Stephens	PERSON	wrote , as carefully as they were by him .

		Chichen-Itza , thanks to Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	, has been much studied and will no doubt finally be adequately described .

		Thorough investiga - tion in Yucatan is no child 's - play .

		Conditions of climate , life , surroundings , render it difficult in the extreme .

		Each visitor to
Yucatec	LOCATION	ruins ought to make an exact and accurate statement of his observations ; thus little by little a mass of reliable data will be accumulated .

		Mr.
Armour	PERSON	's party visited Mugeres , Can - cun , and

		THE DIAL 45 Chichen-Itza , in
Middle North Yucatan	LOCATION	.

		The time spent at these localities was far too short for systematic observation .

		Mr.
Holmes	PERSON	pre - sents us several new ground-plans and some new descriptions .

		His book also contains many plates from photographic originals .

		This is all good .

		There are , however , two features in his work which deserve special mention and render it one of the most important contributions in this field .

		-LRB- a -RRB- From a reading of the literature and from his field work , Mr.
Holmes	PERSON	has prepared a valuable comprehensive study of the archi - tectural details of
Maya	ORGANIZATION	buildings ; this material classified suggests the line of architectural evo - lution .

		The figures in illustration of this study are of much importance .

		In figure 1 , a series of outline drawings , showing examples of ter - races and pyramids , illustrates the range and variation of these structures ; the cut teaches more than a hundred descriptions and views would do .

		Once seen by the student , it renders such descriptions and views thereafter compre - hensible .

		The cut showing a series of ground - plans of Maya temples is equally helpful ; the plans are arrayed in order of complexity , be - ginning with the single room , with one simple doorway .

		Study of this cut alone will do more to orientate the student than anything before written .

		There is danger , however , that some readers will imagine that the series represents an evolution , which must always pursue the same line and ever pass through the same stages which is not , of course , true .

		-LRB- b -RRB- Notable are the panoramas .

		Few who have not been among the ruined cities of Yuca - tan and
Central America	LOCATION	can conceive the dif - ficulties that their study presents .

		Most of them are in forest or thicket .

		Often one may travel within a few rods of important structures without knowing of their existence .

		To secure a photograph of a single building it is necessary to employ a considerable force of men to clear away the vegetable growth that hides it .

		Fre - quently one building can not be seen from a neighboring building , and it is difficult for the student to keep clear ideas of orientation .

		Of course , carefully made ground-plans give the relation in position of the different structures , but to most persons ground-plans mean little .

		Mr.
Holmes	PERSON	presents ground-plans of
Uxmal	LOCATION	and Chichen-Itza ; but he does more .

		Opposite them he places panoramic views of the two places , as gained from an imaginary standpoint above .

		The gain in definiteness of conception is astonishing .

		Study of the ground-plan , indeed , gives the idea that certain buildings occupy certain positions with reference to each other .

		Study of the panorama gives the feeling that this was once really a place where men lived , and thought of the buildings as in use and hints of their purpose force themselves upon us .

		In these two features in the clear study of architectural details and in the panoramic views Mr.
Holmes	PERSON	's book is preeminently helpful .

		STUDIES IN MEDIAEVAL , LITERATURE .

		* There are two ways of dealing with the his - tory of general literature .

		One of them is the long-practised method of treating a literature as a national product , and studying its devel - opment with but slight reference to the parallel development of its contemporaries , ignoring the fact that all the literatures of modern
Europe	LOCATION	are to a considerable extent spiritually cognate .

		The other is the comparative method , which has gained much ground of late , and which rests upon the fundamental assumption that the literature of one country may best be understood when we take into account the con - temporary literature of the others , and that the conception of a literary species held by one race may be brought most clearly into view when we study the development of that species under other conditions of race and historical environment .

		It is in this comparative spirit that the series of volumes entitled '' Periods of European Literature '' has recently been under - taken and entrusted to the general editorial direction of Professor
George Saintsbury	PERSON	, who himself provides the volume which covers the literary product of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries .

		For the series as a whole twelve volumes have been planned , and assigned to men of excellent authority in their respective fields .

		Professor
W. P. Ker	PERSON	, for example , will write of '' The Dark Ages , '' Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	of '' The Romantic Revolt '' of the close of the eighteenth century , and Mr.
Walter H. Pollock	PERSON	of `` The Romantic Triumph '' of the early nineteenth century .

		Such a programme as this arouses high anticipations , and the vol - ume first to appear -LRB- which is the second in the chronological order -RRB- invites a careful scrutiny .

		EPIC AND ROMANCE .

		Essays on Mediaeval Literature .

W. P. Ker	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		46 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	gives to the book which deals with his particular cross-section of the literary tree the title of '' The Flourishing of Romance and the Rise of Allegory . ''

		In an editorial preface , he tells us at considerable length how particularly well he is qualified for his task .

		Lest his readers should still be in doubt , he afterwards recurs to this subject upon a number of occasions , telling us how much he has read , and how diligently he has devoted himself to the literature in question .

		This writing is mostly superfluous , for the test of a work is the way in which it is done , not the volubility with which the writer professes his competence , and , for the rest , the public knows tolerably well what are Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	's achievements , what his limitations , and what his idiosyn - crasies .

		It knows , for example , that he is an enormous reader and has a retentive memory ; it knows also that his strength is in the depart - ments of English , French , and German litera - ture , while it expects from him only second - hand information concerning most of the other departments that come within the scope of his survey .

		It knows , moreover , that he frequently indulges in obiter dicta that are more plausible than convincing , and that he is capable of writing in a most exasperating style .

		After an introductory chapter upon '' The Function of Latin '' as a vehicle for the mes - sage of medieval thought , the author plunges into his subject proper , taking
Bodel	PERSON	's familiar couplet for a text . ''

		Ne sont que trois matte res k mil home attendant , De
France	LOCATION	et de Bretaigne et de
Rome	LOCATION	la grant . ''

		Each of these three '' matters '' forms the sub - ject of a separate chapter .

		Of the chansons de geste he writes at length and with an exag - gerated enthusiasm which calls for a few pages of
M. Brunetiere	PERSON	as a corrective .

		He charac - terizes the chansons as '' the half - million or million verses of majestic cadence written in one of the noblest languages , for at least first effect , to be found in the history of the world , possessing that character of distinction , of separate and unique peculiarity in matter and form , which has such extraordinary charm , and endowed besides , more perhaps than any other division , with the attraction of presenting an utterly vanished Past . ''

		In a later passage he writes of the fabliaux in almost equally impas - sioned strain , and again we must refer to
M. Brunetiere	PERSON	for a saner sort of appreciation .

		In discussing `` The Matter of
Britain	LOCATION	, '' the author shows reasonable familiarity with the latest efforts of scholarship to bring some sort of order out of the curious tangle of fact and surmise that surrounds the Arthurian tale , and makes a strong argument for the claim of
Walter Map	ORGANIZATION	to be considered as chiefly respon - sible for the moulding of the Legend into the form which gave it a literary vitality so great and so enduring .

		Having discussed these sub - jects , and the '' matter of
Rome	LOCATION	'' -LRB- which deals chiefly with the tales of Troy and of Alexander -RRB- , Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	proceeds to the making of the English language and the settlement of its prosody .

		Here we come to the beginnings of English lyric , and the refrain , '' Blow , northerne wynd , Send thou me my suetyng , Blow , northerne wynd , blou , blou , blou , '' is not inaptly described as '' Tennysonian verse five hundred years before
Tennyson	PERSON	. ''

		A chapter entitled '' Middle High German Poetry , '' which is too brief to consist of much more than a series of phrases , is followed by a long disquisition upon '' The ` Fox , ' the ` Rose , ' and the Minor Contributions of
France	LOCATION	. ''

		The following passage upon the literary predom - inance of twelfth and thirteenth-century
France	LOCATION	is strikingly put , but hardly overdrawn : ''
France	LOCATION	, if not
Paris	LOCATION	, was in reality the eye and brain of
Europe	LOCATION	, the place of origin of almost every literary form , the place of finishing and polishing , even for those forms which she did not originate .

		She not merely taught , she wrought and wrought consum - mately .

		She revived and transformed the fable ; per - fected , if she did not invent , the beast-epic ; brought the short prose tale to an exquisite completeness ; enlarged , suppled , chequered , the somewhat stiff and monotonous forms of Provencal lyric into myriad-noted variety ; devised the prose-memoir , and left capital examples of it ; made attempts at the prose history ; ventured upon much and performed no little in the vernacular drama ; besides the vast performance , sometimes inspired from elsewhere but never as literature copied , which we have already seen , in her fostering if not mothering of Romance . ''

		In still another passage , we are told more suc - cinctly : '' It is the simplest truth to say that in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries
France	LOCATION	kept the literary school of
Europe	LOCATION	, and that with the single exception of
Iceland	LOCATION	, during a part , and only a part , of the time , all the nations of
Europe	LOCATION	were content to do , each in its own tongue , and sometimes even in hers , the lessons which she taught , the exercises which she set them . ''

		The chapter which closes up the French section of the history is brought to an end by a few paragraphs upon
Ruteboeuf	PERSON	, the chronicles of Villehardouin and
Joinville	LOCATION	, and the lovely tale of '' Aucassin et Nicolete . ''

		The remainder of Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	's work is devoted to chapters upon '' Icelandic and Pro- ven9al '' -LRB- thus curiously bracketed together -RRB-
1897	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 47 and '' The Literature of the Peninsulas . ''

		Here the author 's knowledge is most evidently de - fective , and he gives us little more than a meagre compilation ; but he is hardly to be blamed for not having made all the provinces of mediaeval literature his own , and , when all is said , there are probably few men living who could have covered the two centuries as satis - factorily as he has done .

		And his style , in spite of its mannerisms , is always sprightly and attractive , lending interest to the dullest subjects , and carrying the reader on without much jolting from theme to theme .

		We shall be pleased indeed if Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	's collab - orators contrive to make their several volumes as readable as we have found this one to be .

		Published almost simultaneously with the book just now under review , Professor
W. P. Ker	PERSON	's '' Epic and Romance , '' being a collection of essays on mediaeval literature , calls for con - sideration at the same time .

		As a collection of essays , rather than a continuous history , this book does not have the unity and the symmetry of Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	's volume , yet it has far more of these qualities than might be supposed .

		In scope , it is somewhat broader , ranging from the earliest productions of Teutonic poetry all the way down to the finished and self-conscious art of Chaucer and
Boccaccio	PERSON	.

		In the arrange - ment of its material , we find a twofold basis of classification .

		First , there is the division sug - gested by the title , and , throughout his treat - ment , the author keeps steadily in view the dis - tinction between the epic and the romantic forms .

		This distinction is set forth as follows : '' Whatever Epic may mean , it implies some weight and solidity ; Romance means nothing , if it does not convey some notion of mystery and fantasy .

		A general distinction of this kind , whatever names may be used to render it , can be shown , in mediaeval literature , to hold good of the two large groups of narrative belonging to the earlier and the later Middle Ages respectively .

		Beowulf might stand for the one side , Lancelot or
Gawain	PERSON	for the other .

		It is a difference not confined to literature .

		The two groups are distinguished from one another , as the respectable piratical gentleman of the
North Sea	LOCATION	coast in the ninth or tenth century differs from one of the companions of
St. Louis	LOCATION	.

		The latter has something fantastic in his ideas which the other has not . ''

		The other division of the author 's material causes it to be grouped -LRB- after the preliminaries are disposed of -RRB- under the three heads of Teu - tonic Epic , Icelandic Saga , and Old French Epic , and to each of these subjects a main sec - tion of the work is devoted .

		The first of them lies without the scope of Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	's book , but the other two run parallel with it , and a comparison of the respective treatments is instructive .

		Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	is at his best on the ground of French epic , and at his worst in the domain of Icelandic saga .

		Professor
Ker	PERSON	, on the other hand , is distinctly at his best in dealing with the latter subject , and the inade - quacy of Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	's treatment becomes very apparent when we compare it with this work of a real scholar in Icelandic .

		We know of no better treatment of the subject in English than may be found in - these chapters , and for them , even more than for the others , Professor
Ker	PERSON	has earned our gratitude .

		No truer thing than the following was ever said of Icelandic literature : '' Clear self-consciousness is the distinction of Ice - landic civilization and literature .

		It is not vanity or conceit .

		It does not make the Icelandic writers anx - ious about their own fame or merits .

		It is simply clear intelligence , applied under a dry light to subjects that in themselves are primitive , such as never before or since have been represented in the same way .

		The life is their own life ; the record is that of a dispassionate observer . ''

		We might say many other things in praise of these essays upon mediaeval literature .

		They display , for one thing , a happy gift of tren - chant epigrammatic expression , as in this state - ment : ''
Ulysses	PERSON	quoting Aristotle is an anach - ronism ; but
King Alfred	LOCATION	's translation of
Boethius	ORGANIZATION	is almost as much of a paradox . ''

		Or in this : '' The comprehensiveness of the greater kinds of poetry , of Homer and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, is a different thing from the premeditated and self-assertive realism of the authors who take viciously to common life by way of protest against the romantic extreme . ''

		As here ap - plied , '' viciously '' is a genuine critical epithet .

		We must find space , also , for praise of the author 's fine characterization of a heroic age , whether exemplified by Homer or by the chronicles of
Njal	ORGANIZATION	or
Kiartan Olafsson	PERSON	.

		Above all , we must praise the scholarly thoroughness of the entire work , and the mastery with which the author has handled his intricate and diffi - cult subject .

		48 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, FACT AND FICTION IN SOCIAL , STUDY .

		* Mr.
H. de B. Gibbins	PERSON	, the author of a popular '' Industrial History of
England	LOCATION	, '' has prepared an enlarged work with the same aim and outline , to which he gives the title '' Industry in
England	LOCATION	. ''

		The purpose of the author was to relate a concise story of economic history which might serve as a preliminary sketch for those who wished to gain the essential elements of the subject or to proceed to more elaborate treatises .

		The materials are divided into five historical , periods , from the Nor - man Conquest to
Modern England	LOCATION	.

		In each period the industrial life is brought into the foreground .

		Political , military , and ecclesiastical changes are noted only as they affect or are affected by economic activities .

		The productive processes , exchange , methods of agriculture and stock-raising , internal and foreign traffic , markets , roads , division of labor , regulative institutions , guilds , corporations , and industrial laws , are among the chief topics discussed .

		The book is written in the spirit of
Green	ORGANIZATION	,
Rogers	ORGANIZATION	,
Cunningham	PERSON	, and
Ashley	LOCATION	.

		The common daily life of the people is brought before us as in a drama , and is shown to have surpassing interest .

		As the author approaches the modern time , the materials become more abundant and the treatment more vivid and partisan .

		Sympathy for the workers is not concealed .

		It is the modern note throughout .

		Those who were once ignored by princes , historians , politicians , poets laureate , and ecclesiastics , are coming into recognition .

		Democracy not only insists upon the rights of the living but upon the rights of the dead .

		The proletarian is vindicating the per - sonal reputation of the poor .

		It is marvellous how much has been concealed , stowed away as insignifi - cant rubbish , barely alluded to in the effort to glorify the great .

		The emphasis falls now upon a different place .

		Such a book as the one under notice has more than antiquarian interest ; it reveals to us the master-thought of our own age while it describes the past .

		The maps , while few , are very valuable and instructive .

		The footnotes furnish a bibliography which directs to the best accessible sources and gives suggestive criticism of their contents and value .

		It would be a good book to put in the hands of a
University Extension	ORGANIZATION	class during the progress of a course of lectures on the labor movement .

		It is more special than
Green	ORGANIZATION	's '' Short History , '' and brings up the discussion of such subjects as the manor , village , mark , and f uedal organization to our own day .

		the condition of the working classes , and agricul - tural depression , are carefully treated , and the account has great contemporary interest .

		If any reader can learn anything new from the work entitled '' The Revolutionary Tendencies of the Age , '' his knowledge of economics and social history must be very limited .

		The inequalities of human life are described in somewhat florid style and with numerous dreamy allegories .

		Economic power is the goal of Democracy .

		Revolution is inevitable now that the people have come to their senses through universal education .

		If the horse were intelligent he would let no man ride him .

		But what will be the nature of the revolution ?

		Not absolute Socialism .

		What then ?

		It is not quite clear .

		But we needed no ghost to come from the abyss to tell us that riches give power and that poverty is exceedingly inconvenient .

		Perhaps this judgment should be tempered by the consideration that the author earnestly and forcefully urges the responsibility of the possessors of wealth , and places in very clear light the central aspiration of the working classes and their certain control of the future .

		He will not consider methods of violence , but hints at limitation of inheritance and other legal measures of redistribution of accumulated fortunes .

		The aim of the interesting little volume entitled '' Genesis of the Social Conscience '' is , as indicated in the sub-title , to show '' the relation between the establishment of Christianity in
Europe	LOCATION	and the Social Question . ''

		The method is the exact opposite of that followed by
Loria	PERSON	and
Marx	PERSON	from the economic to the spiritual .

		With a fixed and an - nounced purpose , political and economic history `` are passed coolly by . ''

		The germination and growth of a new valuation of the individual man are traced through the ages of Christian history .

		Christianity set an infinite price upon the soul .

		The idea of the one God involves the unity of the race , since all are equally made in the divine image .

		Personality implies freedom .

		The sense of sin reduced aristoc - racy to a level with the lowest ; '' all equal are within the
Church	ORGANIZATION	's gate . ''

		The notions of humanity , the Kingdom of God , duty , help to furnish '' the Re - former 's Conscience . ''

		Out of these beliefs are born the French Revolution , Democracy , universal suffrage , care for the '' downmost man . ''

		The book is more than a tacit protest against the materialistic explanation of history .

		It takes life at a higher level than the phrase '' Man is what he eats . ''

		It assumes that man can not live by bread alone , and indicates the social power of forces which seem small and dim only because attention is not bestowed upon them .

		The pages glitter with bright sayings , and there are many attractive passages .

		The reader may find some difficulty in keeping the thread of the argument , because the author leaps back and forth , from
Aquinas	PERSON	to
Aristotle	LOCATION	, from
Augustine	LOCATION	to
Rousseau	PERSON	, with alarming agility .

		He himself says : '' The vast bulk of events is untouched .

		1897 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 49 I shall seem to make ideas advance to the sound of the trumpet , like the things that happen in one of
Dumas	PERSON	' novels . ''

		The absence of events gives at times a rather unearthly impression ; but the mod - ern instances quickly remind one that a thoroughly practical man is teaching him .

		Incidentally , we wonder what the author means by saying -LRB- p. 225 -RRB- , ''
Lincoln	PERSON	's
Gettysburg	LOCATION	address , without the name of God in it , is religious to the core . ''

		Which text , of the three extant , did he have before him ?

		Mr.
Bellamy	PERSON	's new book , '' Equality , '' is written in a style that may seem to many tedious .

		To one acquainted with Socialistic literature , there is noth - ing in its principles that is new .

		The book is a re-statement of ideas already made familiar by
Marx	ORGANIZATION	,
Lassalle	LOCATION	, Proudhom ,
Fourier	PERSON	, ''
Merrie En	PERSON	- gland , '' and all the rest .

		But for all that , we must not ignore the message it bears .

		One-sided it is ; often unjust and exaggerated ; concealing the good of an age and minifying the difficulties of Socialism ; but honest , searching , earnest , all must concede it to be .

		The sins of our day are unsparingly exposed to view ; modern instances illustrate many pages ; the wrongs and cruelties that make the conscience of all good cities gnaw at the heart are graphically set forth .

		The story of the book is soon told : two lovers talk economics , the Socialist always coming off with easy victory because the capitalist advocate had already given up his cause .

		This is kept up through four hundred pages .

		It will not pay to buy the book for its dramatic interest .

		The gallery of pictures of '' Looking Backward '' is here somewhat enlarged .

		Marx never tried to tell what a socialistic society would be like .

		Even
Bebel	PERSON	's '' Die Frau '' carefully kept out of the proph - ecy business .

		Kantzby 's '' Erfurt Program '' dis - tinctly asserts that a Socialist ought not to try to depict the future state of the terrestrial
New Jeru	LOCATION	- salem .

		The weather prophets , dealing in their high towers with relatively simple elements , do not fore - tell the meteoric changes of the next week , and they are in luck if they are right for forty hours in ad - vance .

		But here is a prophet who makes a pano - rama of a city which is not yet to exist for a century .

		It looks like courage .

		The fundamental doctrine of '' Equality '' is Com - munism . ''

		The corner-stone of our state is economic equality .

		... What is life without its material basis , and what is an equal right to life but a right to an equal material basis for it ?

		What is liberty ?

		How can men be free who must ask the right to labor and to live from their fellow-men and seek their bread from the hands of others ?

		How else can any government guarantee lib - erty to men save by providing them a means of labor and of life coupled with independence ?

		... What form of happiness , so far as it depends at all on material facts , is not bound up with economic conditions ? ''

		The Declaration of Independence , therefore , logic - ally leads to Socialism of a communistic type .

		Lib - erty and happiness are impossible without a secure income .

		The imaginative writer of '' Equality '' distributes promises of a salary of
$ 4000	MONEY	a year to all citizens with a lavish hand .

		Why that particular sum was fixed , and out of what annual national income it is to be paid , are questions which are easily waved aside .

		The poet is under no such vulgar obligations as a statistician or an economist .

		And in judging the book we must steadily remember that we are reading a poet , like the author of Utopia , and not a serious work on economics .

		All through the book there seems a protest against the law of competition , as being cruel and unjust , as immoral .

		But the author usually fails to see that it is a simple wnmoral force , which can be used for good or evil according to human intelligence , character , and social organization .

		He does catch a glimpse of the idea that this blind energy , like gravity and lightning , may be harnessed and driven when he writes -LRB- p. 38 -RRB- about '' ranking , '' by which he means '' the figure which indicates his previous standing in the schools and during his service as an unclassified worker , and is supposed to give the best attainable criterion thus far of his relative in - telligence , efficiency , and devotion to duty .

		When there are more volunteers for particular occupations than there is room for , the lowest in ranking have to be content with a second or third preference . ''

		The horns of the beast of competition are tipped with gold and the tail is decorated with ribbons , but they are there , even in the
Communistic Heaven	ORGANIZATION	.

		The address -LRB- p. 99 -RRB- to the Masters of the Bread is a very incisive piece of irony .

		It is an appeal to capitalists for permission to be their slaves for a morsel of bread . ''

		O Lords of the Bread -LSB- say the laborers -RSB- , feel our thews and sinews , our arms and our legs ; see how strong we are .

		Take us and use us .

		... Let us freeze and starve in the forecastles of your ships ... Do what you will with us , but let us serve you , that we may eat and not die . ''

		The professional men , college professors , editors , and lawyers , cringe before the same potentates : '' O Masters of the Bread , take us to be your servant .

		... Give us to eat , and we will betray the people to you , for we must live .

		We will plead for you in the courts against the widow and the fatherless .

		We will speak and write in your praise , and with cunning words confound those who speak against you and your power and State . ''

		The preachers also beg of the capitalists : `` We must have bread to eat like others .

		... In the name of God the Father will we forbid them to claim the rights of brothers , and in the name of the
Prince of Peace	ORGANIZATION	will we preach your law of competition . ''

		The cry of the women and the children is almost too pathetic and suggestive to repeat .

		And there is only too much truth in the picture .

		When we come to look closely at the facts , how - ever , things are not so bad or so dark .

		Not all great publishing-houses , for example , are dominated 50 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, by heartless Capitalism , for on the title-page of this vigorous plea for Socialism stands the name of the great house of
D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The contrast starts a smile , and emphasizes the promise that the Revolution is to he bloodless .

		The treatment of the question of police and mil - itary force -LRB- p. 318 -RRB- deserves study on the part of all who desire to know what wage-workers almost universally feel in the cities of this country .

		They regard the
National Guard	ORGANIZATION	simply as a Capitalist Guard .

		`` In
1892	DATE	the militia of five States , aided by the regulars , were under arms against strikers simultan - eously , the aggregate force of troops probably making a larger body than General
Washington	LOCATION	ever com - manded .

		Here surely was civil war already ... To this pass the industrial system of the
United States	LOCATION	was fast coming it was becoming a government of bay - onets . ''

		This state of things is rightly regarded as full of peril .

		The morality of family inheritance is absolutely denied , but general social inheritance is not ques - tioned .

		According to the author , the people of a county or state or nation may hold as their own goods which their ancestors toiled for , but the immediate children of the particular persons who earned this property have no claim as members of the family .

		This discrepancy seems to have escaped the attention of the author .

		He says : '' While the moralists and the clergy solemnly justified the inequalities of wealth and reproved the discontent of the poor on the ground that those inequalities were justified by natural differences in ability and diligence , they knew all the time , and everybody knew who listened to them , that the foundation principle of the whole property system was not ability , effort , or de - sert of any kind whatever , but merely the accident of birth , than which no possible claim could more com - pletely mock at ethics . ''

		When the Revolution comes , capitalists will not be reimbursed for their losses ; they will be glad enough to escape punishment for their former oppressions .

		The book entitled '' Woman and the Republic , '' by
Helen Kendrick Johnson	PERSON	, is calculated to make summer weather in some quarters pass rapidly from warm to hot .

		A man who has for many years advo - cated woman suffrage almost feels the courage ooze out of him when he reads this woman 's book accus - ing the universal-suffrage movement of being un - just , undemocratic , and all that is evil .

		To what are we coming ?

		Chivalry is at a discount ; the desire to be fair is not appreciated .

		But these vigorous chapters will provoke discussion .

		One can already hear the champions of '' equal franchise '' cutting the rods with which to chasten this `` slave '' who dares defend her oppressor , the tyrant man .

		Just imagine a woman , one who has studied history and law books , retailing such rank heresy and trea - son as this book contains .

		`` The movement to obtain the elective franchise for woman is not in harmony with those through which woman and gov - ernment have made progress . ''

		The universal suf - frage has not helped , but has hindered , the anti- slavery movement , missions , charities , the war for the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, the opening of trades and professions to women .

		Woman suffrage is at war with democratic principles , and is allied with monarchy , aristocracy , and ecclesiastical oppression .

		The author subjects to criticism the claim that woman suffrage can rest on the maxims '' Taxation without representation is tyranny '' and `` There is no just government with - out the consent of the governed . ''

		The laws relating to property , it is claimed , have been improved by men far more rapidly than if women had votes .

		The influence of women on political life is great because it is non-partisan .

		The Suffrage Woman 's Bible is declared to be so poorly edited that the women who gave it to the world have no claim to a respectful hearing on educational subjects .

		In rela - tion to religious preaching , it is said : '' While the possibilities of her nature tend to make her supreme in capacity to point the way to higher regions , it also contains qualities that may render her pecu - liarly dangerous as a public leader . ''

		The disabilities of sex are such that women can - not perform the duties of a voting citizen , and there - fore ought not to be clothed with power to get the country into trouble when force is required to de - fend it . ''

		To attempt to put it -LSB- the ballot -RSB- into the hands of those who are not physically fitted to main - tain the obligations that may result from any vote or any legislative act , is to render law a farce , and to betray the trust imposed upon them by the con - stitution they have sworn to uphold . ''

		The privi - leges of a voting citizen imply police , jury , and military duty , and it is not enough to '' distribute tracts and hold conventions . ''

		In relation to the Home , the author believes that '' the Suffrage movement strikes a blow squarely at the home and the marriage relation . ''

		And , to sum up all : '' The greatest danger with which this land is threat - ened comes from the ignorant and persistent zeal of some of its women .

		They abuse the freedom under which they live , and to gain an impossible power would fain destroy the Government that alone can protect them .

		The majority of women have no sympathy with this movement ; and in their enlightenment , and in the consistent wisdom of our men , lies our hope of defeating this unpatriotic , unintelligent , and unjustifiable assault upon the integrity of the American Republic . ''

		THE DIAL 51 BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Cicero and his friends .

		One is not surprised to see the name of a new translator on the title-page of ''
Cicero	PERSON	and His Friends , '' the third volume of
Boissier	PERSON	's works , which the Putnams have put forth in English dress , and the change proves on examination to be a decided improve - ment .

		We find none of the glaring blunders in classical names , references to classical literature , Latin quotations , etc. , which marred the other two volumes , and the thought of the original seems to have been reproduced with a fair degree of accuracy as a general thing .

		To the latter point , however , some surprising exceptions will be noticed , as the reversal of the sense of a passage on page 328 by the reproduction of a double negative , and the weak '' all that he wills he means , '' page 309 , for '' tout ce qu'il veut , il le veut bien . ''

		Perhaps it is too much to ask a translator to correct inaccuracies in his original , but one who takes up such a work as this for translation ought to know the twenty - first book of Livy well enough not to let omnibus take the place of omnis in the words '' Qucestus omnis patribus indecorus visus '' The faults of this translation are irritating to the reader because they are faults which might easily have been re - moved had the translator -LRB- Adnah
David Jones	PERSON	^ taken a little time for revision .

		A sentence here and there shows that he can place the word '' only '' in a fitting position , but we have counted more than fifty passages in which he has failed to do so .

		He splits infinitives with the barbarous glee of an Indian splitting skulls , and does not care enough for accuracy of expression even to avoid such bungling as ''
Cicero	PERSON	was perhaps more indebted for this union ... to Catiline rather than to himself . ''

		And yet the reader will find that the charm of Boissier rises above all these infelicities , and makes the book well worth the time necessary for its reading .

		The `` Famous Scots Series '' -LRB- im - tn fi
Sco	ORGANIZATION	P t r hLts .

		Parted by Scribner -RRB- has pretty well established its reputation by this time , so that we have now a good idea as to what to expect of new volumes .

		The last two to reach us that on
Smollett	PERSON	, by Mr.
Oliphant Smeaton	PERSON	, and that on
Boswell	PERSON	, by Mr.
Keith Leask	PERSON	are as good as the volumes already published .

		Mr.
Smeaton	PERSON	gives a brisk hearty account of the great novelist , in a good broad style , and succeeds in keeping the sympathy of the reader with his rather difficult sub - ject .

		We are a little puzzled at his thinking that
Smollett	PERSON	died in his fifty-second year , when he has given the dates of his birth and death as 17211771 , and also at his saying that
Thackeray	PERSON	achieved with rare effect '' the evolution of character through the medium of letters . ''

		Probably , however , there are letters in some of
Thackeray	PERSON	's novels , and certainly a year more or less in a man 's age is a minor matter .

		As for
Boswell	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Leask	PERSON	rescues him from the pil - lory of Macaulay only to gibbet him anew .

		His con - ception of
Boswell	ORGANIZATION	, more complete and accurate than
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's , differs from it chiefly , we are inclined to think , as
1831	DATE	differs from
1897	DATE	.

		The present
Boswell	PERSON	is nearly as contemptible as
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's ; he seems more natural to us , because some of his traits an exaggerated sensibility and versatility and an exaggerated self-importance are rather common to-day .

		Boswell seems also to have been quite lacking in principle and in power , so that we under - stand his being able to write
Johnson	PERSON	's life no better after we have read his own .

		Both
Smollett	PERSON	and
Boswell	PERSON	are men worth writing of .

		But in a series of Famous Scots they are in curiously incongruous company .

		Taking them all in all , they were , we suppose , as lacking in Scotch characteristics as any Scots one would readily think of .

		English politic * and subject of English politics of the development of eight hundred years ago is not of the national spirit .

		itgel ver y interesting , yet when set forth to show the development of national character , and the danger of permanent deterioration that was then escaped , it takes on both interest and value .

		Professor
O. H. Richardson	PERSON	has rewritten the his - tory of the middle portion of the thirteenth century in his monograph , '' The
National Movement	ORGANIZATION	in the
Reign of Henry III	ORGANIZATION	.

		and its Culmination in the Barons ' War '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , in such a way as to present clearly , first , the denationalization of En - gland under the exactions and aggressions of the papacy , the swarm of foreign favorites , and the weak wilf ullness of the
King	LOCATION	; then the reaction of these upon the national spirit in church and people , resulting in the rise of a strong national spirit and the firm establishment of the fundamental rights of the people .

		It is a thoroughly creditable piece of work , based on an independent study of the sources , yet steadied by the work of the master in this field , Bishop
Stubbs	PERSON	.

		It is not without a spice of hero - worship in the sympathetic account of the great
earl Simon	PERSON	, yet this is not so strong as to vitiate the work , while adding zest to it .

		It is interesting to note that the publication of the book is followed immediately by the election of its author to a pro- fessorship at
Yale	ORGANIZATION	.

		From the press of Edward Arnold comes '' The Beggars of
Paris	LOCATION	, '' written by
Louis Paulian	PERSON	.

		Lady
Herschell	PERSON	's name is on the outside , but she is merely the translator .

		The author turned beggar and ex - plored
Paris	LOCATION	.

		He lived by begging , and beat his way with delightful success .

		He discovered that begging is a lucrative profession which thrives on thoughtless almsgiving .

		One stands by a wall , rubs his eyes till they smart , and collects twice the wages of a mechanic simply by holding out his dirty cap .

		All the tricks of the trade are here exposed in de - tail , and the story is enlivened by anecdote .

		The records of the
Bureau of Associated Charities	ORGANIZATION	, or of the Relief and
Aid Society	ORGANIZATION	, would furnish par - Segging as a fine art .

		52 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, allels for nearly every type .

		The social need is a radical treatment of the whole class ; an offer of work to the able-hodied , prompt arrest of every beggar , humane hiding from publicity in suitable almshouses of those whose infirmities and friendless condition make it impossible for them to be self - supporting .

		This lesson applies to
America	LOCATION	as well as to
France	LOCATION	.

		The story is so interesting that it is a good book for charity workers to circulate .

		Professor
Giddings of Columbia	ORGANIZATION	has rendered no small service in prepar - ing , under the title '' Theory of So - cialization '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a syllabus of his larger work on `` The Principles of Sociology , '' already noticed in THE DIAL .

		It is a great advantage to have the argument outlined by the author himself , apart from the vast mass of material by which he illustrates and establishes his vital ideas .

		The sylla - bus is enriched with some new examples , and cer - tain propositions about appreciation , utilization , and characterization appear here for the first time .

		The definition of his famous phrase , '' consciousness of kind , '' as now given is , '' the state of consciousness in which a perception of resemblance , sympathy , and liking , and a desire for recognition , are com - bined . ''

		The statement of the modes of equality -LRB- p. 35 -RRB- is very suggestive , and helps to give defi - niteness to a word which expresses the aspirations of the democracy , but is misleading and hurtful unless it is explained and its limits accurately and rationally bounded .

		The volume entitled `` Thackeray 's Haunts and Homes '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- allures in the first place by its title , and in the second place by the beauty of the illus - trations , which occupy the larger part of the space in the volume .

		The illustrator is also the author , and was
Thackeray	PERSON	's personal friend ,
Eyre Crowe	PERSON	, A.R.A. His book consists of a sheaf of sketches made for the sake of preserving the outward look of
Thackeray	PERSON	's habitations before the inevitable house - wrecker shall sweep away these literary vestiges .

		The text follows , in approximate chronological se - quence , the connecting links in the chain of events which led to the various changes of
Thackeray	PERSON	's surroundings .

		The book is welcome both for its artistic and biographic value , since it brings one quite near to the immortal Thackeray '' in his habit as he lived . ''

		The conditions of our
Lord	ORGANIZATION	' t life on
Earth	LOCATION	.

		The questions involved in a discus - sion of the life of Jesus while on earth are again in the front rank .

		Professor
Mason	PERSON	delivered five lectures on this theme before the
General Seminary	ORGANIZATION	in
New York	LOCATION	in
1896	DATE	, on the Bishop Paddock foundation , and they are now published in book form by Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Though somewhat over - grown with verbiage , the lectures reveal a careful study of the Gospels and of the literature of the topic .

		Of the five lectures , the most strikingly new in inan -
Tolstoi	PERSON	' t Gotpel in brief .

		ner is that on `` Our Lord 's Knowledge upon Earth , '' though the position is practically the same as that held by the most illustrious of the
Church Fathers	ORGANIZATION	.

		While the book is modern in construction it is ancient in position , and adds next to nothing to our weapons of warfare .

		Count
Lyof N. Tolstoi	PERSON	has crowned his literary works with one which , though a condensation of a larger work , should be entitled '' My Gospel in Brief . ''

		It is a fusion of the four New Testament gospels into one , but into the one that the author conceives to be the true one .

		He omits '' all passages relating to the life of John the Baptist ,
Christ	ORGANIZATION	's birth and genealogy , his miracles , his resurrection , and the references to prophesies fulfilled in his life . ''

		With these expunged ,
Christ	ORGANIZATION	's teaching is , according to
Count Tolstoi	LOCATION	, the most conventional presentment of metaphysics and morals , the purest and most complete doctrine of life , and the highest light which the human mind has ever reached .

		-LRB- Pub - lished by
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- LITERARY NOTES .

		The third of Mr.
G. P. Humphrey	PERSON	's '' American Colonial Tracts '' is a reprint of '' A State of the Province of
Georgia	LOCATION	, Attested upon Oath , in the Court of
Savannah	LOCATION	,
November 10 , 1740	DATE	. ''

		The date of the original is 1742 .

		The most northern paper in the world is printed at
Godthaab	LOCATION	, in
Greenland	LOCATION	, and is called '' Lsesestof . ''

		It is a missionary sheet , made for the Eskimos , and has been the means of teaching many of them to read the Danish language .

		The
New Amsterdam Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	announce for imme - diate publication '' Women Novelists of Queen
Victoria	PERSON	's Reign , '' and a new revised edition of '' Lady
Hamilton	PERSON	and
Lord Nelson	PERSON	, '' an historical biography by Mr.
John Cordy Jeaffreson	PERSON	.


Daniel Greenleaf Thompson	PERSON	, of
New York	LOCATION	, the author of '' The Philosophy of Fiction in Literature '' and other works , died at his home on the tenth of
June	DATE	.

		He was a lawyer by profession , and was for a term of years President of the
Nineteenth Century Club	ORGANIZATION	.


Henri Meilhac	PERSON	, who , both by his own unaided pen and in collaboration with
M. Hale	PERSON	`` vy , has contributed so much to the gaiety of theatre-going people , died in
Paris	LOCATION	on the sixth of
June	DATE	, at the age of sixty-five .

		He succeeded
Labiche	PERSON	in the
Academy	LOCATION	about ten years ago .

		Mr.
Edward Arnold	PERSON	will shortly publish Sir
Harry Johnston	PERSON	's '' British Central Africa , '' and announces for immediate publication Mr.
Grant Allen	PERSON	's new book , '' An African Millionaire . ''

		The same firm will also issue in sumptuous form the unique work on which Mr.
Albert Hartshorne	PERSON	has been engaged so many years , '' Old English Glasses . '' ''

		The American Monthly Review of Reviews '' is the new title of the popular periodical edited by Mr.
Albert Shaw	PERSON	.

		In course of time , it will doubtless come to be known more briefly as '' The American Monthly , '' which reminds us -LRB- obsit omen -RRB- that a magazine thus entitled was once published in
Chicago	LOCATION	, and came to an
1897	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 53 early end .

		We are glad that the change has been made , although for a time it may be found a little con - fusing , but the magazine in question is so different from , and so vast an improvement upon , its English prototype , that it ought to have a distinctive name of its own .

		We have received the first four numbers of '' La Diplomatic , '' a new semi-monthly review published in
Paris	LOCATION	, and edited by
M. Rene '' BreViaire	PERSON	.

		Its special field is that of diplomatic affairs and international poli - tics , but it has also departments of musical and theat - rical affairs , of society , sport , and finance .

		It thus appeals to a considerable range of interests , and we have found it very readable .

		It is attractively printed and well illustrated .

		Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	of the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	is about to publish for the
Egypt	LOCATION	Exploration Fund part of a papyrus book found at
Behnesa	LOCATION	, on the edge of the Libyan desert , by Mr.
Bernard P. Grenfell	PERSON	and Mr.
A. S. Hunt	PERSON	of
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		There will be much con - troversy as to the antiquity of these '' Logia , '' but it is not improbable that the collection was made at the be - ginning of the second century , or even earlier , and the writing of the sentences may date from the second cen - tury .

		The sayings are detached , without context , and each begins with the words '' Jesus saith . ''

		In addition to reproducing the leaf by collotype process , it has been decided to print a cheaper edition for a few cents so that the treasure may be brought within the reach of everyone .

		THE INDEPENDENT says : '' Of all the ' aids ' for the popular study of the
Bible	LOCATION	, which belong in the general class of Teachers ' Bibles , THIS is EASILY FOREMOST AND BEST ... The marked feature of the ' Treas - ury ' is that every part of it is new , and that it contains none of that sequacious compilation which is based on works once in repute , but which at the best rise no higher than belated attempts to bring an old thing up to the gauge of a new one .

		... The number of contributors who hare taken part in the work is thirty-eight .

		They make a list which commands con - fidence and challenges admiration . ''

		THE SUNDAY SCHOOL WORLD says : '' ... Looking at the '
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	' in its broader features , and as the latest ' Helps ' for Teachers ' Bibles , the intelligent reader will , we think , pronounce it a decided advance upon any that have hitherto appeared .

		This is evident in the log - ical order of the material , in the proper arrangement of the engravings and illustrations , blended with the descriptive text and fitting in the place where they belong .

		Placing the Concordance , proper names and subject index under one alpha - betic list also has decided advantages .

		This is a drama of frail human nature aspiring to perfection and struggling to attain the highest ideal .

		The story opens in the Isle of Man , but the action takes place for the most part in
London	LOCATION	, and the author 's strenuous preparation for this book is suggested by the succession of moving and dramatic scenes from a strange and unknown life in the world 's metropolis .

		His mastery of the human drama has never been shown so forcibly .

		The romance throbs with life , and the emotional force of these pictures of aspiration , temptation , love , and tragedy reaches a height which will make a lasting impression upon the literature of our time .

		Immense changes are undoubtedly in store for the coming century .

		The industrial transformations of the world for the past hundred years seem to assure for the next hundred a mutation in social conditions commensurately radical .

		The tendency is undoubtedly toward human unity , social solidarity .

CONTINENTAL	ORGANIZATION	LITERATURE I. Following our custom of several years , we print in this and the following issue of THE DIAL a summary of the literary activity of the past twelvemonth in the principal European countries , based upon the invaluable series of special reports contributed to the '' Athenaeum '' for
July 3	DATE	.

		Thirteen countries are covered altogether , and we follow the alphabetical arrangement of our English contemporary . '

		Professor
Paul Fredericq	PERSON	, writing from Bel - gium , records a considerable achievement in the department of national history , noting many monographs and collections of import - ance .

		Among books of travel there is '' En Congolie , '' by
M. Edmond Picard	PERSON	, who went out to
Africa	LOCATION	to scoff and remained to pray ; and a posthumous volume of '' Lettres de Voyage , '' by
Emile de Laveleye	ORGANIZATION	.

		In literary criticism there is ''
Dante	PERSON	et Ses Precurseurs , '' by
M. Zanardelli	PERSON	, and a `` Discours sur le Renouveau au Theatre , '' by the
M. Picard	ORGANIZATION	already named .

		In belles-lettres , the '' original and extravagant ''
M. Emile Verhaeren	PERSON	has produced two volumes of verse , and
M. Mae	PERSON	- terlinck a collection of ''
Douze	PERSON	Chansons . ''

		The same
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	has also printed the prose drama '' Aglavaine et Selysette , '' which certainly has an enticing title . ''

		While the Flemish movement agitates all
Belgium	LOCATION	violently in view of a law which is to place the Flemish language on a complete footing of equality with French , which has been recog - nized as the official language of the kingdom since
1830	DATE	, Flemish literature does not share in the polemics and the agitation of French literature in
Belgium	LOCATION	.

		It is in a state of dull placidity . ''

		The most noteworthy Flemish pro- ductions are
M. Cyriel Buysse	PERSON	's novel , '' Op ' t Blauwhuis , '' and a few historical studies .

		Professor
V. Tille	PERSON	's Bohemian report may be illustrated by the following extracts : '' Bohemian literature during the period 1896-7 has not shown so much vigour as in the preceding twelve months , although the number of publications is still very large .

		Many collections of verse have appeared , but few of them rise above mediocrity ... One of the most beautiful and powerful collections of patriotic verse is
Neruda	PERSON	's posthumous
Friday	DATE	Songs , ' which sprang from passionate love of his country and people , and show anew what a mind was lost to the Bohemian nation by his death .

		... In fiction Bohemian litera - ture still lacks the modern novel of character a want not compensated by some attempts at shorter tales of this class .

		Stories of all kinds and shades are coming out as numerously as poems , but the majority of them do not rise above the average , and many of the produc - tions of even older story-tellers follow the beaten path , without attempting to be artistic .

		The best of them are still those that delineate minutely the life of the Bo - hemian country people , as the subject itself secures attention . ''


Denmark	LOCATION	, whose literary affairs are chroni - cled by Dr.
Alfred Ipsen	PERSON	, has a somewhat more interesting story to tell . ''

		Our sesthetic liter - ture appears to have reached a point where form has been developed to the highest perfec - tion , but it would also now and then seem as if we were at a loss for the material to fill in the 62 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, form . ''


Herr H. F. Ewald	PERSON	, `` the Nestor of Danish authors , '' has published ''
Liden Kir	PERSON	- sten , '' a new historical novel which combines the romantic feeling of Ingemann with the more exacting scholarship of the present day .

Herr Holger Drach	PERSON	- mann , our brilliant poet , celebrated in

		From the
King	ORGANIZATION	and the Court , however , he received no sign of sympathy or regard , owing to the unsatisfactory character of his domestic life .

		The inspired and rich quality of his work is a feature of our literature in these times of spiritual decline and mannerism .

		Gen - erally so fertile , he has not this year produced any new volume , but has only revised and altered one of his plays of earlier years . ''

		An important undertaking in a more serious field is the great subscription history of
Denmark	LOCATION	, upon which seven of the foremost Danish historians are now engaged .

		M.
Joseph Reinach	PERSON	opens his interesting ac - count of the year in
France	LOCATION	with some remarks upon the effects of free trade in literature . ''

		It is probable , '' he says , '' that the
second half of the nineteenth century	DATE	will seem to future history chiefly characterized , from this special point of view , by the activity of the literary exchanges between
France	LOCATION	on the one side , and on the other certain foreign countries , notably
Russia	LOCATION	, the Scandinavian peoples ,
England	LOCATION	, and even
Germany	LOCATION	.

		No one can doubt that
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	owes much to
Balzac	LOCATION	and George Sand ; but
Tolstoy	LOCATION	, in his turn , has exercised a con - siderable influence on several of our country - men of to-day .

		Ibsen , he too , derives from
George Sand	PERSON	, and above all
Alexandre Dumas	PERSON	the younger .

		... I am ready to believe that the French novel has for several years past left its mark on the English novel , which now attacks subjects before which it once recoiled . ''


M. Zola	PERSON	, we are told by
M. Reinach	PERSON	, is losing his prestige in
France	LOCATION	. ''

		All his old disciples have deserted him to enter on other paths , and he is visibly outliving his reputation . ''


M. Bourget	PERSON	, also , has less vogue than heretofore . ''

		It would be too much to say that adultery has ceased to take a chief place in the French novel ; but its place is growing less year by year .

		People are decidedly tired of this sort of story . ''

		The one masterpiece of the year is the Basque story of '' Ramountcho , '' by ''
Loti	PERSON	. ''

		Other works of fiction that have attracted much attention are the '' Jardin Secret '' of
M. Prevost	PERSON	, the '' Jean d'Agreve '' of
M. de Vogue	ORGANIZATION	, the '' Image '' of
M. Emile Pouvillon	PERSON	, and the ''
Orme	PERSON	du Mail '' of M.
France	LOCATION	.

		The latter book '' is a succes - sion of sketches of administrative , ecclesiastical , and political life in the provinces .

		These sketches are lively , witty , and their style recalls at once Renan and Voltaire ; but I really must ask readers not to believe that all our prefects and all our bishops resemble the figures in
M. France	LOCATION	's book . ''

		As for poetry , '' M. Cop - pee has deserted it for journalism , M. Sully -
Prudhomme	PERSON	for philosophy and science .

		M. de
Heredia	PERSON	has never written , as the world knows , more than one volume of sonnets ;
Leconte de L'Isle	ORGANIZATION	and
Banville	PERSON	are dead , and have left no heirs to their places . ''

		Two new writers of verse , MM .

		F. Gregh and Rivoire , show signs of promise .

		Literary criticism and history are in a flourishing condition , and are illustrated by many good books .

		The
Due de Broglie	ORGANIZATION	has written on
Malherbe	PERSON	, and
M. Hallays	PERSON	on Beau - marchais , for the '' Grands Ecrivains Fran - 9ais . ''

		M.
Petit de Julleville	ORGANIZATION	's monumental history of French literature is making satisfac - tory progress .


M. V. Rossel	PERSON	has written an important book on the literary relations be - tween
France	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	.

		M.
Henry Har	ORGANIZATION	- risse has left
Columbus	LOCATION	for the Abbe
Prevost	PERSON	, and has brought the author of ''
Manon Les	PERSON	- caut '' into the clear light of history .

		M. Duclaux 's '' Pasteur '' attempts '' a history of this great spirit , the genesis of his discoveries , the outcome of his struggles . ''

		The celebrated history of ''
Elle	PERSON	et Lui '' has been revived , and has resulted in the publication of much new material concerning both
George Sand	ORGANIZATION	and Alfred de Musset . ''

		The controversy , it seems , is lasting long enough to provide still a theme of animated discussion at literary dinners .

		I am not at all clear whether it would not have been better to let these dead people sleep undis - turbed in their graves . ''

		Among the more solid publications of the year are
M. Fouillee	ORGANIZATION	's work on '' The Positivist Movement , '' the '' Car - nets , '' written in 1863-64 by
Taine	PERSON	-LRB- '' there 1897 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 63 is in this small volume almost all the substance of the * Origines ' '' -RRB- , the Vicomte d'Avenel 's researches on '' Le Mecanisme de la Vie So - ciale , '' Leon Say 's posthumous `` Les Finances , '' M. Block 's ''
Petit Dictionnaire Politique	PERSON	et Social , ''
M. Perrens	PERSON	's `` Les Libertins en
France	LOCATION	au XVIIme .

		Siecle , '' the tenth volume of MM .

		Lavisse and Rambaud 's '' Histoire de
France	LOCATION	, '' and endless books and memoirs relating to the
First and Second Empires	ORGANIZATION	.

		This documentary literature includes the '' Correspondance Ine - dite '' of Merimee , the '' Correspondance '' of
Victor Hugo	PERSON	, and the '' Derniers Me moires des Autres , '' by
Jules Simon	PERSON	.

		Even the real history of the
Third Republic	ORGANIZATION	is '' beginning to emerge from the farrago of occasional publica - tions , '' and is in a way summed up in the single volume of Challemel-Lacour 's speeches , '' a manual of philosophy from which all students of public affairs , whatever their country , can draw equal profit . '' ''

		The imaginative literature of
Germany	LOCATION	, '' says
Hofrath Robert Zimmermann	PERSON	, '' is arrayed under the banners of realism and symbolism .

		Its strength lies in the drama ... On the other hand , lyric and narrative poetry is de - clining . ''

		The dramatic '' prize juries '' have awarded the honors of the year to
Herr Haupt	PERSON	- mann and
Herr	PERSON	von Wildenbruch .

		Probably the most important work of the year is
Herr Hauptmann	PERSON	's fairy drama , '' Die Versunkene Glocke . ''

		Here '' the writer transports himself and his audience to the realm of fairyland ; the supernatural weapons , the elfs , the spirits of the water and the wood , who take part in the action , possess the same reality as the human beings , the bell-founder
Heinrich	PERSON	and his family , with whose destiny elfs and mortals interfere , mingling in the play as in ' A Mid -
summer	DATE
Night	TIME	's Dream . ' ''

		Other dramatic productions of the year are
Herr Sudermann	ORGANIZATION	's three one-act pieces called ''
Morituri	PERSON	, ''
Herr Fulda	PERSON	's '' The Son of the Caliph , '' also a sort of fairy tale , with a
Nietzschean Uebermensch	ORGANIZATION	for a hero ,
Herr Hirschfeld	PERSON	's '' Die Mutter , ''
Herr Hango	PERSON	's `` Nausicaa , '' and
Herr Eber	PERSON	- mann 's '' Die Athenerin . ''

		The two works last mentioned are Viennese productions , deriving from
Grillparzer	PERSON	and
Munch	ORGANIZATION	-
Bellinghausen	PERSON	.

		In poetry , a new volume by
Herr Detleff	PERSON	von Liliencron , including '' Poggfred , '' styled by the author '' a topsy-turvy epic in twelve can - tos , '' occupies the place of first importance .

		In this lyric-narrative work , '' descriptions of na - ture , sketches of moor and heath , literary out - bursts of indignation and enthusiasm ,
Ariosto	PERSON	- like pictures of love , and Verestschaginesque pictures of battles alternate with pessimistic reflections , passages of mystical devotion , and references to the world 's history . ''

		The author , we are told , '' is deemed by his admirers the first lyric poet of the age , '' while '' by many others he is regarded as one of the most gifted . ''

		The most important novel of the year is
Herr Spielhagen	PERSON	's '' Faustulus , '' a Pomeranian story , having for its hero '' a doctor transferred from the over-intellectual atmosphere of a large town to a small one , '' and playing therein the parts of both
Faust	LOCATION	and Mephistopheles .

		`` There are few novels which afford the reader such a feeling of a?sthetic contentment through scenic excellence and living characterization , of eth - ical satisfaction through the dramatic conse - quentially and impartial justice . ''

		Other works of fiction that have attracted considerable atten - tion are ''
Das Rathsel	PERSON	des Lebens , '' by
Herr Heyse	PERSON	; ''
Herbstreigen	PERSON	, '' by
Herr	PERSON	von Saar ; '' Die Siegerin , '' by
Frau Clara Sudermann	PERSON	; ''
Der Zauberer Cyprianus	PERSON	, '' by
Herr	PERSON	von Wildenbruch ; '' Friihschein , '' by
Herr J. J. David	PERSON	; `` Heimkehr , '' by ''
Ossip Schubin	PERSON	'' ; Schleichendes Gift , '' by
Herr Adolf Wil	PERSON	- brandt ; '' Im Chiemgau , '' a historical novel by
Herr Felix Dahn	PERSON	; and a narrative of old Ratisbon , by Dr.
Georg Ebers	PERSON	.

		The historical literature of the year centres mainly about the Emperor
William I.	PERSON	, whose centenary was cele - brated in
March	DATE	.

		Professor
Oncken	PERSON	's '' Unser Heldenkaiser '' is an '' inspired '' account of the career of the restorer of the Empire .

		Herr von Strautz 's '' Illustrirfce Kriegschronik '' pictures the wars of
1864	DATE	,
1866	DATE	, and
1870	DATE	.

		The death of the three great historians ,
Treitschke	ORGANIZATION	,
Sybel	PERSON	, and
Ernst Curtius	ORGANIZATION	, has given a heavy blow to historical scholarship .

		The quater-centenary of
Melanchthon	ORGANIZATION	's birth has also called forth a considerable literature .


Gottfried Keller	PERSON	's let - ters is the most important book of the year in the way of literary memoirs .

		There are several noteworthy books in philosophy and aesthetics , among them being
Alfred von Berger	PERSON	's volume of critical essays , a monograph on the Greek philosophers by
Herr Gompertz	PERSON	, a work on the esthetics of tragedy by
Herr Johannes Volkelt	PERSON	, and
Herr von Hartmann	PERSON	's '' Kategorienlehre , '' which forms the tenth volume of the philoso - pher 's collected works .

		`` A publication at once original and symptomatic of the tendencies of thought among the present generation in the field of literature , and more especially of the pictorial arts , is the periodical '' Pan , '' which is now in the second year of its existence , and 64 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, may be regarded as the organ of the modern school . ''


Greece	LOCATION	, represented in this symposium by Professor
Lambros	PERSON	, contributes few items of interest to the year 's chronicle . ''

		The Muses are no friends of Mars . ''

		Dr.
Kerameus	PERSON	has published some unedited letters of the Patriarch Photius from manuscripts preserved at
Mt. Athos	LOCATION	, and Professor
Lambros	PERSON	has printed from the same source the fables of
George	PERSON	- ZEtolos , a Greek author of the sixteenth century .

		More important for the history of modern Greek cul - ture is the following announcement : '' The chief event in literature is the beginning of a project due to the generosity of a rich Greek who is settled at
Odessa	LOCATION	, a former burgomaster of that town .


Gregor Maraslis	PERSON	has undertaken to make the Greeks acquainted with masterpieces of the historical , philo - logical , archaeological , and philosophical literature of other countries by means of the best possible translations .

		The series will be printed at
Athens	LOCATION	, and arrangements provide for the appearance of a part of one hundred and sixty large octave pages every month ; the get-up is excel - lent , the price very low .

		From another point of view also the collection is of interest even for foreigners , as it will supply the best materials for the study of modern Greek .

		Later on the yearly parts will be doubled in number , and the library will , in accordance with the founder 's design , also include original works , perhaps even pay attention to jurisprudence and medicine . ''

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		JAPANESE SELF-TAUGHT .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I have already called your attention to the increasing popularity of the English language in educational and journalistic enterprises in
Japan	LOCATION	.

		This renewed interest in that well-nigh '' universal language '' has arisen , of course , from the fact that , in about two years from now , when the new treaties go into effect , this entire Empire will be thrown wide-open .

		In view , therefore , of the near approach of '' mixed residence , '' the Japanese people realize the necessity of becoming familiar with that language which will be spoken by the largest num - ber of foreigners coming to , or resident in ,
Japan	LOCATION	.

		But mixed residence will not impose a duty on the Japanese alone ; it will also bring upon the foreigners the neces - sity of knowing more or less of the vernacular .

		This shows to us the raison d'etre of a book recently published , under the ambitious title of '' Japanese Self - Taught , '' by Messrs.
Kelly & Walsh	PERSON	, of
Yokohama	LOCATION	.

		The author is a European , who has become a natural - ized Japanese , has taken a Japanese name , and has a good practical knowledge of the Japanese language .

		He says in the preface : `` The book is not intended for learned sinologues , but for persons who , while having only a limited time at their disposal , desire to gain some insight into the construction of Japanese colloquial sen - tences , and to familiarize themselves with words useful to them in their vocations without wading through an intricate mass of confusing grammatical rules . ''

		The book is not , therefore , a grammatical treatise or a scientific exposition of this peculiar language ; nor is it ungrammatical or unscientific .

		It is preeminently a practical handbook , of which one special feature is a collection of five hundred colloquial phrases , given in both the '' familiar '' and the '' polite '' styles of speech .

		This distinction is a very important one , and is also very difficult ; but it is very carefully expressed and explained in these colloquial exercises .

		The commercial vocabulary is especially comprehensive and valuable .

		On the whole , the book seems to be one which will prove very useful to travellers and business men in giving a good working knowledge of the Japanese language .

		PREPARATORY ENGLISH .

		A TEACHER 'S EXPERIENCE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		After reading your interesting editorial on '' The Teaching of English Once More , '' I am tempted to give a bit of my own experience in preparing pupils for col - lege in English , an experience covering fifteen years .

		When I began the work , I found that by keeping my eye upon the examination likely to be set it was not a difficult task to prepare the pupils to pass '' with credit '' ; but I soon found also that this method was not devel - oping any literary taste or love of the study ; and I con - cluded that it would be better to give up the study en - tirely than that such results should follow .

		From that time I have valued the student 's disposition toward his work his enthusiasm and love of reading far more than his ability to reproduce the story of which he read .

		The former I consider a much better preparation for doing the English work in college .

		I have been con - firmed in this opinion by the testimony of my pupils and the opinion of the best teachers of English in the colleges ,
Harvard	LOCATION	,
Yale	ORGANIZATION	, the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology	ORGANIZATION	, and the smaller colleges generally .

		I do not imply by this that I make less of written work than formerly ; as a matter of fact , written work i & much more frequent ; but after there has been created an interest in the subject this work loses its terrors and is done with pleasure and profit .

		Again , when properly related to written work , as a means and not an end , rhetoric becomes one of the most interesting of studies .

		Instead of having the pupil cor - rect the bad English of others , I set him to work upon his own .

		When I return his themebook with marginal signs indicating faults of diction or construction , he is required to rewrite the sentence in which such errors occur and to make a reference to the rhetoric where the error is discussed .

		This literary study , composition , and rhetoric are correlated in such a way that the pupil sees at once the organic relation of one to the other .

		The pleasure and profit of this work , both to teacher and pupil , may not admit of the test by the formal examination , but it is as real as life itself , and gives to every exercise its most enduring quality .

		The question which I would now ask is this : Is it not possible to order the examinations in English for en - trance to college so that the student may reveal some - thing of these essentials for college work , literary taste and love of the subject ; ability to write clear , con - cise , and vigorous English , which in itself is evidence of a knowledge of the principles of rhetoric ?

		I believe that there are many classrooms where this is being done every day .

		THE DIAL 65 00b .

		ACROSS AND AROUND
SPITSBERGEN	LOCATION	.

		* The gratification of the -LRB- to most of us -RRB- rather unaccountable impulse which periodically drives men like Sir
William Martin Conway	PERSON	, Mr.
MacCormick	PERSON	, and Mr.
Whymper	PERSON	from the snug security of their '' ain firesides '' to the uttermost parts of the earth in quest of wastes unexplored and peaks unclimbed , is becoming a matter of some difficulty .

		To people with a taste for real pioneering , an up-to-date map offers a comparatively barren and perplexing prospect .

		The once vast areas which the old cartographers used to embellish with figures of griffins and other then not incredible monsters have shrunk to an insignificant stretch or two near the Poles .

		Africa is no longer a Dark Continent save in respect of the alleged '' shadiness '' of its stock-jobbing and land - grabbing operations ; and , since
Nansen	PERSON	, people have already begun speaking of the
North Pole	LOCATION	in that tone which
Jeffrey	PERSON	was charged with using toward the Equator .

		Sir
William Martin Conway	PERSON	could hardly , one would think , have been beset with an em - barrassment of riches in the way of alluring fields for exploration and adventure when he elected to go to
Spitsbergen	LOCATION
last summer	DATE	.

		The island was not inaptly described by the sport - ing member of Sir
William	PERSON	's party as a land '' botched in the making and chucked aside unfinished . ''

		Being the most accessible of all Arctic lands ,
Spitsbergen	LOCATION	is the one that has been most frequently visited .

		The
Gulf Stream	ORGANIZATION	, pushing its warm waters northward , melts in the ice-covered polar sea , an open bay extend - ing in
summer	DATE	to the 80th and sometimes even to the 82d parallel of north latitude .

		This bay forms a convenient avenue of approach to
Spitsbergen	LOCATION	, which skirts , through several de - grees of latitude , its eastern side .

		The com - parative accessibility of the island has marked it as a goal of the
summer	DATE	tourist .

		The ubi - quitous '' trippers '' are already carrying droves of cockneys of all nations to its ice-girt shores a fact that was once brought home to our author and his companions in a rather amusing way .

		They discovered in a particularly bleak and desolate spot on the coast what appeared to be the grave of a sailor , a lone mound * THE FIRST CROSSING OF

Hamburg	LOCATION	.

		D. 29 , 7 ,
1893	DATE	. ''

		Much valu - able sentiment was bestowed on this tumulus , and the fate of the apparently ill-starred '' Vogelgesang '' was duly deplored : but it was learned some weeks later that the monument was one raised to commemorate a gigantic beer - drinking bout or Kneipe enjoyed by a party of tourists who had come up in the big
Hamburg	LOCATION	- American liner on the date given . ''

		Assur - edly , '' says the narrator , '' the vulgarization of
Spitsbergen	LOCATION	has begun . ''

		While , however , the coasts and outlying islands of
Spitsbergen	LOCATION	have been pretty fre - quently visited and partially explored , its in - terior was , up to the date of Sir
William	PERSON	's expedition last
summer	DATE	, practically unknown .

		To reveal the character of this unknown in - terior was the main object of his journey , the expense of which was partly borne by the
Royal Geographical Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		With Sir
William	PERSON	went Dr.
J. W. Gregory	PERSON	-LRB- author of the '' Great Rift Valley of
Africa	LOCATION	'' -RRB- , Mr.
A. Trevor-Battye	PERSON	, and Mr.
E. J. Garwood	PERSON	, each of whom contributes a special chapter to the present work .

		The results of the venture in some respects sur - passed , in others fell short of , expectations .

		The party crossed overland from Advent Bay -LRB- their base of operations -RRB- to
Klok Bay	LOCATION	, from
Klok Bay	LOCATION	to
Sassen Bay	LOCATION	, and from
Sassen	PERSON	to
Agardh Bay	LOCATION	, on the east coast , and back to
Advent Bay	LOCATION	.

		Thirteen mountain ascents were made .

		A sketch survey of a specimen area of about six hundred square miles in the heart of the middle belt of the country was brought home , besides a more rapid outline chart of the hills bordering
Wijde Bay	LOCATION	.

		In addition to the main cross-country expedition , a subsidiary one was made in the little touring steamer '' Ex - pres , '' chartered for the purpose , round the coasts of
Spitsbergen	LOCATION	.

		The main island was -LRB- the condition of the ice proving exceptionally favorable -RRB- nearly circumnavigated , this trip thus forming the most complete voyage of reconnaissance ever accomplished in a single season .

		Almost all the great fjords that pen - etrate
Spitsbergen	LOCATION	were entered to their heads .

		The west , north , and south coasts of
North - East Land	LOCATION	were viewed , from
Cape Platen	LOCATION	round to
Cape Mohn	LOCATION	.

		Landings were made at the
Seven Islands	ORGANIZATION	, and Wiches Land -LRB- King
Carl	PERSON	's Land -RRB- was closely approached .

		Some six hundred photographs of all parts of Spits - bergen were brought back .

		Such were the topographical results .

		The scientific ones , says 66 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, the author , '' were more important , and will be duly chronicled hereafter . ''

		About two months in all were spent at
Spitsbergen	LOCATION	, of which time thirty-six consecutive days were employed in the journey into the interior .

		More could have been accomplished had the weather been less persistently foggy , and had the party not been handicapped by their Nansen sledges .

		These , says the author , '' while excellent for ice-work , are the worst for boggy and stony places ... Our combination of ponies with
Nansen	ORGANIZATION	sledges was about the worst possible . ''

		The practical results of the journey were , however , as we have said , on the whole satisfactory ; while , adds Sir
William	PERSON	, '' even had we accomplished no exploration nor added aught to scientific knowledge , the journey would have been worth while for the mere pleasure of it . ''

		Among the '' pleasures '' may be reckoned , we presume , the spectacle of the vagaries of certain tourists found disporting themselves at Advent Bay .

		One of these especially , a gentleman who had come up from Trondhjen to see
Herr Andree	PERSON	and his balloon , added much to the general joy . ''

		His costume was most picturesque long boots , a long ulster , a great fur cap , a revolver slung round his waist , a horn over one shoulder , and a camera over the other .

		The horn , he explained , would be valuable if he were to be lost on the mountains whose gentlest sloping foot he never approached .

		He walked up and down the beach with dramatic gait , then turned towards the bay and solemnly fired off all the chambers of his revolver , after which he blew a blast on the horn .

		Then he fired off his camera in all directions , and so re - turned to the ship and vanished . ''

		Most of the tourists brought rifles with them , under the impression that '' bears , or at least reindeer , herded at every point along the shore . ''

		Many were the narrow escapes from the stray shots of these ''
Nathaniel Winkles	PERSON	. '' ''

		A bullet came close over the tent of one of my companions .

		Others whizzed near the heads of the sal - vage men working at the winterers ' wreck .

		One fool - ish creature is said to have mistaken a photographer with his head under the cloth of his camera for a reindeer , and put a bullet through his hat .

		Another , when we were away in the little steamer on the north coast , stalked , and I believe fired , upon our inoffensive ponies . ''

		In
August	DATE	, while circumnavigating Spits - bergen in the '' Expres , '' Sir
William	PERSON	touched at
Danes Island	LOCATION	, the scene of
Herr Andree	PERSON	's preparations for his proposed aerial voyage to the
Pole	LOCATION	.

		The invitation of this intrepid -LRB- some say rash -RRB- aeronaut to go over his balloon-house with him was eagerly accepted . ''

		... We were shown how the gas was made , and the long silk pipe meandering among the stones to con - vey it into the balloon .

		The great distended sphere filled the roofless wooden house and bulged out above .

		Like all balloons , when seen near at hand , it appeared surprisingly large .

		It is related of a shy curate , who had sat in absolute silence throughout a dinner at the squire 's house , that with the coming of desert he sud - denly remarked , apropos of nothing , ' The cuckoo is a larger bird than you 'd suppose . '

		The same general statement I maintain to be true of balloons .

		They are all larger than you would suppose ... No one could see Andre * e and not be struck by the evident force and capacity of the man .

		In his presence , the idea that any wavering of intention found place in his mind was inconceivable .

		Pestered , as he had been for weeks , by inquisitive visitors , he seemed on the defensive , and suspicious of criticism in every question .

		He had been told that his scheme was in every respect impracticable . '

		They said I could not set up and inflate my balloon in this place .

		I have set it up and inflated it .

		They said it would not hold the gas for a sufficient time without leakage .

		It has now been inflated for ten days or more , and it does not leak .

		There were two little needle-point holes only , and those were easily mended .

		We have considered everything and provided against every acci - dent , and now we are certain that , whenever the right wind blows , we can start without a hitch .

		It is not enough for me that the wind should be from the right quarter .

		I must have a chance of decent weather , so that we may be able to see something ... There is always plenty of wind early in the season .

		Three days of a moderate wind , blowing approximately from the south , is all we need .

		After that the wind may blow how it pleases , it can not help taking us toward some of the land that encircles the polar ocean .

		We can re - main afloat for three weeks , and in that time , with any luck , we ought to be carried down to some habitable country . ' ''

		It seems clear that good luck , no less than good management , is relied upon by
Herr Andree	PERSON	to bring his venture to a successful issue .

		While Sir
William	PERSON	's adventures in the frozen north were not , comparatively speaking , of a specially thrilling or novel order , the story of them is pleasantly told and affords a clear impression of a considerable specimen tract in the hitherto unknown interior of
Spitsbergen	LOCATION	.

		The descriptions of Arctic scenery are notably graphic , supplemented as they are by a profu - sion of excellent pictures , comprising eight large colored plates reproduced in facsimile from Mr.
H. E. Conway	PERSON	's drawings , and about one hundred full-page and text illustrations from photographs and sketches .

		There are two maps -LRB- engraved originally for the
Royal Geographical Society	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , one a sketch map of the mountains along the shores of
Wijde Bay	LOCATION	, the other a sketch map of the interior tract traversed by the author .

		The volume is a notable specimen of sound and elegant English book-making , and forms a handsome addition to Messrs.

		THE DIAL 67 THE EVOLUTION OF A CONSTITUTION .

		* The American concept of a Constitution differs radically and fundamentally from the British concept .

		The difference is so great that the ordinary student of his own system is constantly embarrassed in his efforts to under - stand the corresponding features of the trans -
Atlantic	LOCATION	system .

		The American constitution is established , surrounded by a protective en - vironment , made independent of legislative changes , and has an appearance of fixity .

		The British constitution seems , to an American versed in the principles of his own system , to be so variable , so transitory , and so illusive , as to scarcely deserve the name of '' constitution . ''

		Yet the Briton prefers his own system , believes it a true '' constitution , '' and deems the Amer - ican plan to be straight-laced , repressive , and tyrannical , and therefore less fitted than his own to the genius of a free people .

		So variant from each other are these two systems of gov - ernment , that the provisions of the one are scarcely '' thinkable '' to those immersed in the ideas and concepts which distinguish the other .

		It is the object of Professor Macy 's treatise on '' The English Constitution '' to make its peculiar principles '' thinkable '' to the average American .

		By this means , he seeks to enable students in our colleges more fully to contrast the British institutions with our own , and thus to understand more clearly the features which distinguish the American constitution .

		Such a treatise naturally takes a popular form , which will commend it to the attention of a wide circle of readers .

		Very properly , the author presents it , not as a substitute for the treatises of English jurists on their own constitution , but as an introduction to those treatises for American students .

		The period of the estrangement and separa - tion of the American colonies from the mother - country was one of protracted discussion con - cerning the nature and character of the British constitution .

		The plan of artificial alterations of that constitution , to conform to modern views , had been proposed , only to be rejected , in
England	LOCATION	.

		With the exception of the changes introduced by the Bill of Rights and the Suc - cession Act , the development of the constitution of the empire was allowed to '' drift . ''

		That changes in that constitution were imminent , was apparent to the colonists ; indeed , it was * THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION .

		A Commentary on its Nature and Growth .

		By
Jesse Macy	PERSON	,
M.A. New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		their unalterable opposition to the changes pro- posed by the parliamentary party , and their adherence to the constitutional principles under which they had built up their colonial govern - ments , that brought upon the colonists the mil - itary power of
England	LOCATION	, resulting in the war of the Revolution and the withdrawal from the empire .

		The Atlantic-wide isolation of the colonies , and the extent of their reliance on the provisions of their charters , naturally developed a disposition toward written constitutions .

		Given this disposition , joined to a conservatism which adhered to the principles of the old con - stitution of the empire , given , on the other hand , the laissez-faire disposition in the islands to allow the constitution to be changed by leg - islation , as occasion might arise , and we have two distinctive theories of government , which in a little more than a century have developed into the two types of constitution , so radically diverse that each has its own vernacular , which must be studied by itself , and for a thorough comparison of the two there must be transla - tion of the terms of the one into the language appropriate to the other .

		Mr.
Macy	PERSON	furnishes the key for such a translation of the principles of the unwritten British constitution into the American vernacular .

		The first part of his treatise sets forth the powers of the several governmental agencies of the British system , namely , the two houses of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, the Crown , the
Ministry	ORGANIZATION	, and the Courts , and explains the '' checks and bal - ances '' of that system .

		The essentials of these several agencies , in the constitution as now operative , are tersely stated , and their points of difference from their American correlatives are sharply accentuated .

		The `` checks and bal - ances '' which in
America	LOCATION	inhere in the written constitution are in
England	LOCATION	found , not in the law , but in what Mr.
Dicey	PERSON	happily calls '' the conventions of the constitution . ''

		Says Mr.
Macy	PERSON	: '' The constitution , viewed simply as a combination of the forces which centre in the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	, con - sists of certain habits , customs , and understandings , in accordance with which the separate parts are harmonized and prevented from mutual encroachments . ''

		And how are these understandings enforced and these encroachments prevented ?

		Not by appeal to the courts .

		Following Mr.
Dicey	PERSON	in his `` Law of the Constitution , '' Mr.
Macy	PERSON	explains in more condensed form the mode in which the English '' conventions '' check and balance .

		The conservatism of old political habits has as full sway in government as the 68 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, conservatism of old fashions has in the cus - tomary dress of the people .

		He says : '' I once tried to point out to a
Birmingham	LOCATION	Radical the perils of the English Constitution .

		He replied that every Englishman was at heart conservative ; that this was as true of the laboring man as of the nobility .

		The checks which the American expects to enforce by judi - cial process , the Englishman expects to maintain by the state of mind of the citizen . ''

		And what is the office of the English courts ?

		Do they not enforce the principles of
Magna Charta	ORGANIZATION	, and protect the liberty and rights of the free man ?

		Yes ; but not against the legis - lature .

		It is against encroachments by the ministerial officers that the courts set them - selves .

		The judiciary do not undertake to check the legislative department , as under the Amer - ican system .

		Hence there is no such vast growth or development of constitutional juris - prudence as in this country .

		How the present governmental agencies have been evolved out of those which distinguished the earlier constitution of
England	LOCATION	, is enter - tainingly shown by Mr.
Macy	PERSON	.

		The old prin - ciples which were thought to be essential to that constitution , have been ostensibly preserved ; but how transformed !

		The prerogative of the Crown , that relic of despotism , that ready weapon of the tyrant , that bulwark of '' the divine right to rule , '' has not been abolished , but has been perpetuated as a power of the cabinet , and transmuted in their hands into the active agent of modern democracy .

		To illus - trate in these columns the details of the evolu - tion , in this and other features of the British constitutional system , would be to reprint here page after page of Mr.
Macy	PERSON	's treatise .

		The second part of his work is a commentary upon the constitutional history of
England	LOCATION	.

		Here the processes of political evolution , which have given to the majority of the
House of Com	ORGANIZATION	- mons the extensive powers of government which were once exercised by Tudors and Stuarts , are traced with sufficient detail to make them clear to non-British readers .

		The revolution is shown to have been more evolutionary than revolu - tionary , the principal change effected thereby having been the final rooting up and destruc - tion of the old pretense of a divine right to rule , while the
Tudor	PERSON	and
Stuart	PERSON	idea of a unified and concentrated government has been retained as a distinguishing feature of rule by the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	.

		The genesis and the develop - ment of the Cabinet ; the rise of political par - ties ; the continuing antithesis of the '' conserv - ative '' and '' liberal '' party principles ; the respective offices of cabinet , ministry , and par - ties , in the work of government ; the general tendency toward democracy , and the increase of that tendency under the Reform Act , all these are illustrated in running commentary by Mr.
Macy	PERSON	.

		The present English idea of a '' Constitution '' as a something fundamental in the government of the empire , is of modern origin ; and its genesis and evolution are traced by our author .

		The puzzle , the mystery , as that constitution appears to be to numerous Americans , is analysed and explained : it is shown to inhere largely in the conservative re - tention of old forms and doctrines of govern - ment put to new uses .

		The powers once exer - cised by tyrants are harnessed to the plough of modern democracy , and are made to prepare the fallow fields for the growth of progressive ideas .

		A stubborn conservatism adheres to old forms , while it fills them full of radical ideas . ''

		The Queen , the
Lords	LOCATION	, and the Commons '' profess to unite in enacting measures that work the will of the
Commons	ORGANIZATION	only ; and the Com - mons find it easier to work their own absolute will by the employment of what seem to Amer - icans to be merely effete fictions in government .

		If , after all , the system still appears to us to be an anomaly , Professor Macy helps us to see how it happens that the anomalous can have a normal and useful operation .

		THE DECORATIVE ILLUSTRATION OF BOOKS .

		* The history of the fine arts is everywhere , among civilized peoples , a record of the influ - ence of a succession of ideas , each in turn dom - inating for a longer or shorter period the char - acter of what is produced .

		As soon as an idea becomes commonplace it ceases to yield full aesthetic satisfaction to cultivated minds .

		In the search for novelty some one among the many seekers happens upon a conception that captivates popular fancy ; other artists lay hold of it also , work it over , develope and extend it , until it too becomes commonplace , and some new notion , or an old one resurrected , attracts attention instead .

		Time was when these move - ments were of sufficient duration for the forma - tion of schools and of styles .

		1897 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 69 cheap reproductive processes , and the restless craving for constant change which is so con - spicuous a feature in modern life , they tend to become shorter and shorter and to degen - erate into mere passing fads ; nor is it unusual for more than one to be in progress at the same time .

		The closing decades of the nineteenth cen - tury have witnessed many such movements .

		Among them none is more noteworthy than the development of what bids fair to reach the dignity of a distinct school of decorative book illustration .

		The pioneer in this movement , and for many years almost its sole exponent , was
Walter Crane	PERSON	.

		It seems , therefore , pecu - liarly fitting that a book treating u Of the Dec - orative Illustration of Books , Old and New '' should come from his hand ; it is all the more disappointing that the result should be meagre and unsatisfying .

		Mr.
Crane	PERSON	takes pains to state that his book , which owes its origin to three Cantor Lectures delivered by him before the Society of Arts in
1889	DATE	, was written '' in the intervals snatched from the absorbing work of designing . ''

		While this in a measure ac - counts for its deficiencies , it hardly explains why so much should be left unsaid .

		Instead of carefully tracing out the causes of the move - ment and following its development from year to year and from hand to hand , as we should naturally expect , he has given us merely a con - siderable number of pictures , accompanied by a collection of rather disconnected remarks upon illuminated manuscripts and the illustra - tion of early printed books ; some appreciative , if not always discriminating , comment on the work of contemporary artists ; and here and there a few words upon decorative principles .

		What he says is for the most part sound and well-considered , but it falls far short of consti - tuting a comprehensive survey of his subject .

		It may be noted , also , that the English is occa - sionally slipshod , as in the following sentence : '' Although the designs have no Persian char - acter about them which one would have thought the poem and its imagery would naturally have suggested , yet they are a fine series . ''

		The movement now in progress Mr.
Crane	PERSON	calls a '' revival , '' but this is true in a limited sense only .

		There is a world of difference between the purely adventitious qualities , the crude simplicity and naivete resulting from inability to overcome technical difficulties , which the works of the early designers exhibit , and the deliberate self-restraint that distin - guishes the designs of the modern men .

		In spite of superficial resemblance , the difference is not merely one of degree or of process : it is a difference in kind .

		Imitation being much easier than invention , with but few exceptions the general tendency of graphic art in all coun - tries and in all times has been toward as much realism as the artists were able to represent .

		The earlier designers of book illustrations , although dominated by conventional ideas in regard to treatment , achieved decorative effect less through conscious aim in that direction than from inability to compass greater realism .

		Concurrently , with increased command of the resources of expression came a decline in per - ception of the higher qualities of harmonic rela - tion of line , mass , and light-and-dark , which are distinguishing characteristics of all enduring achievement .

		The reopening of our eyes to these fundamental qualities is directly attribu - table to the influence of the art of
Japan	LOCATION	the one country in the world where they have never been lost sight of , but on the contrary have ever been insisted upon as prime essentials .

		Perhaps the most interesting item of informa - tion which Mr.
Crane	PERSON	gives is the statement made in speaking of his early designs for chil - dren 's books which have made his name a household word on both sides of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	: '' It was , however , the influence of some Japanese printed pictures given to me by a lieutenant in the navy , who had brought them from there -LSB- sic -RSB- as curiosities , which I believe , though I drew inspiration from many sources , gave the real impulse to that treatment in strong outlines , and flat tints and solid blacks , which I adopted with variations in books of this kind from that time -LRB- about 1870 -RRB- onwards . ''

		In spite of this admission , it is apparent from what he says a few pages further on that Mr.
Crane	PERSON	has never really learned to understand Japanese art nor to appreciate its higher qual - ities .

		Why this should be so , considering his accomplishments as a designer , it is difficult to comprehend .

		When he says that '' They may be able to throw a spray of leaves or a bird or fish across a blank panel or sheet of paper , drawing them with such consummate skill and certainty that it may delude us into the belief that it is decorative design ; but if an artist of less skill essays to do the like the mistake be - comes obvious , '' it is plain that he does not perceive that the controlling idea in the mind of the Japanese artist is composition compo - sition of line in which each leaf or branch or smallest detail must be right in its harmonic relation to every other detail without violating truth of form or of structure , and composition of mass in which the shape and proportion of 70 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, the blank spaces and the value of the contrast afforded by them is as much a matter for thoughtful consideration as any other element that enters into the result .

		If this is not deco - rative design , then what is it ?

		Surely it is widely removed from what Mr.
Crane	PERSON	aptly denominates '' the art of pictorial statement . ''

		As if further to emphasize his misunderstand - ing , he reproduces as examples of Japanese decorative illustration a drawing -LRB- divided into two -RRB- by
Hokusai	PERSON	, from the ''
Mangwa	PERSON	, '' a book of miscellaneous sketches entirely pictorial in their intention .

		It is true , as Mr.
Crane	PERSON	says , that Japanese books '' do not furnish fine ex - amples of page decoration as a rule . ''

		But , on the other hand , neither do English , French , German , or American books ; in
Japan	LOCATION	, as elsewhere , we must turn to the works of par - ticular men for that .

		Were Mr.
Crane	PERSON	familiar with the range of Japanese book - illustration , he would have had no difficulty in finding ex - amples in which the design is arranged so as to fill the space completely a point he lays much stress upon , but which is far easier to accom - plish than the subtle balancing of form and blank space that he does not seem to appre - ciate .

		The real value of the book lies in the pictures , which fill nearly two - thirds of its 335 pages .

		For the most part they have been selected with excellent judgment , but are distributed through - out the text in such a manner as to make the book a troublesome one to read ; while their con - nection with the author 's remarks is so slight that they can not in any exact sense of the word be said to illustrate them .

		With scarcely an exception , however , each one is interesting for itself , and while some of them suffer from too great reduction and others from inharmonious setting , they are on the whole very well repro - duced .

		Taken together , they form a service - able collection for students of decorative illus - tration .

		While it can not be said of the examples given of works by contemporary artists that they furnish an adequate representation of the aims and tendencies of the school , it is perhaps inevitable that a collection made up from the works of a considerable number of men of vary - ing merit should reveal the weakness inherent in the movement rather than its strength , to show which it should be limited to the best works of the leading men .

		And this is espe - cially true of a movement which as yet has been more fruitful of promise than of matured performance .

		THE ETERNAL , PROBLEM OF THE BALKANS .

		* A book that throws light on the
Eastern Question	ORGANIZATION	is always timely , for the question is eternal ; but the present complications in the peninsula give special interest and value to Mr.
William Miller	PERSON	's work on
Roumania	LOCATION	, Bul - garia ,
Servia	LOCATION	, and
Montenegro	LOCATION	.

		Each of the petty divisions is a sensitive spot , and the interests of no one of them can be touched without an instant disturbance in the others .

		There are the conflicting race feelings , first of Turk and Christian , then of Slav and Greek ; there are the mighty plans and jealousies , racial and commercial , of
Russia	LOCATION	and
Austria	LOCATION	, and the petty race and national animosities of
Bulgaria	LOCATION	and
Servia	LOCATION	and
Greece	LOCATION	.

		Anything that ex - plains the historical origins of these animosities , and lays bare their roots , has interest for the reading public in its inquiries into present con - ditions and its forecasts of the future .

		Mr.
Miller	PERSON	's book is a collection of four brief outline histories of about a hundred pages each , written in a straightforward way without pre - tense and without special literary skill , cover - ing the whole period in each from the times of the Roman sway to the present day .

		It is not easy to find pleasure in the long series of brawls , assassinations , raids , and treacheries that make up most of the annals of these countries .

		But for the present interest in the relations of these states , few would read them whose patriotism did not glorify them .

		But the book explains so much in which we have an interest that it commends itself to students of current politics for its matter as well as for its impartiality .

		It is the author 's belief that '' the only true settlement of the mutually conflicting claims of these historic states , which periodically endan - ger the peace of
Europe	LOCATION	, is a Balkan Confed - eration , such as was sketched by the late M. Tricoupis . ''

		Yet he lets the facts speak for themselves , and hints at no method of bringing about this hoped-for settlement .

		And the facts , one must admit , offer little promise of a settlement based on any compromise of national claims , or of any firm union of the hos - tile races .

		There is not yet developed enough of political self-control or of practical political sense among these new nations to permit such a settlement or such a union for a long time to come .

		THE DIAL 71 modern political methods and increasing pres - sure of financial and political conditions may bring about the subordination of sentimental considerations and the compromise of opposing claims sooner than might be expected .

		The individuality of these several peoples is brought out by Mr.
Miller	PERSON	in an interesting way . ''

		It has been truly said that the Montenegrin is the exact opposite of the Bulgarian .

		Put both in a drawing - room , and the Montenegrin , who has never bowed his neck to a foreign master , will look and behave like a gentleman , while the Bulgarian , but lately set free from the Turkish bondage , will look and behave like a boor .

		Put the two upon a waste plot of ground , and the Bul - garian will convert it into a garden of roses , while the Montenegrin will look on .

		This is the result of the national history . ''

		This history is
Homeric	LOCATION	, as are the political institutions of the people .

		The author quotes with approval Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	's extravagant utterance : '' In my deliberate opinion , the traditions of
Montenegro	LOCATION	, now committed to His Highness -LRB- Prince
Nicholas	PERSON	-RRB- as a sacred trust , exceed in glory those of Marathon and
Thermopylae	LOCATION	, and all the war-traditions of the world . ''

		But this Homeric glory gives less promise of prosperity under twentieth-century conditions than the common plodding virtues of their plebeian neighbors .

		Yet even the Mon - tenegrins are abandoning the patriarchal and predatory life for a constitution and trade .

		Full justice is done in this work to the states - manship of
M. Stambuloff	PERSON	, but his serious faults are not covered .

		Prince
Alexander	PERSON	is portrayed with enthusiastic admiration .

		His military prowess , his organization of the army of
Bulgaria	LOCATION	, and his social charms , made him '' the best possible ruler of a country like Bul - garia in time of war ; but he was lamentably deficient in the arts of a statesman . ''

		And this was the cause of his undoing at the hands of
Eussia	LOCATION	, whose plans for the absolute control of
Bulgaria	LOCATION	his patriotism had brought to naught .

		This story of
Alexander	PERSON	's reign and fall is the most spirited portion of the book .

		As to
Alexander	PERSON	's Machiavellean successor , Mr.
Miller	PERSON	is non-committal , giving a negative description that is much more favorable to him than is the current opinion .

		Prince
Nicholas	PERSON	of
Montenegro	LOCATION	is evidently a favorite with the author , and
King Charles of Roumania	ORGANIZATION	receives high praise for his civic and military virtues .

		The way in which
Eussia	ORGANIZATION	has wrested one Balkan state after another from the Turks , only to turn gratitude to hostility by her domineer - ing and grasping policy , is one of the interesting points of the book .


Russia	LOCATION	's position in the peninsula was a few months ago hardly stronger than at the beginning of the century ; while broader statesmanship would have put her at the head of a group of loyal dependent states , and thus in virtual control of the whole pen - insula .

		FAITH AND PHILOSOPHY .

		* Some time since , in commenting on a group of religious books , we drew attention to the increasing force of the historical element in the interpretation of religion .

		We have occasion to renew the obser - vation in connection with the books now before us .

		A thorough study of doctrine , in its historical de - velopment , is sure to carry with it a new estimate of its value and its relation to human life .

		It is in the record of events that the potency and the impo - tency of beliefs finally declare themselves .

		To this statement we add , as an associated truth , the ultimate identity of faith and philosophy .

		A sound philosophy gives us the basis of faith ; and faith , in pushing its inquiries , encounters constantly the reasons for and against its conclusions found in the underlying philosophy .

		Whatever objections or confirmations science may offer to faith , the ulti - mate tribunal is that higher reason which we desig - nate as philosophy .

		Philosophy is sure to renew itself with every generation .

		It is the unfailing effort of the mind to understand itself of the reason to complete itself , returning to its own centre with all its stores of knowledge .

		This fellowship of faith and philosophy has always been apparent , and is the more apparent as the capricious elements involved in the supernatural are eliminated .

		The thought of faith is the strength of reason in the highest range of our experience the conjoint edu - cation of the mind and heart in apprehending and comprehending the spiritual world in which we are .

		Science deals with the world as physical ; philosophy deals with it as spiritual ; and religion works the results of both into the most comprehensive and vital experience . ''

		72 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, course of the
Lyman Beecher Lectures	ORGANIZATION	at
Yale	ORGANIZATION	.

		These lectures have usually been of a sprightly character , growing directly out of the experience of some large-minded preacher , and delivered under the stimulus of being directed to those about to engage in the same form of service .

		They have been stim - ulating rather than instructive , and practical in a large rather than in a narrow way .

		The nine lec - tures before us are a favorable example of their kind .

		They are on such themes as '' The Genesis of a Sermon , '' '' Problems of Preaching , '' '' The New Dogma , '' '' The Minister 's Care of Himself . ''

		They are full of the inner life of the speaker , are clear and pleasing in style , and are sustained by a constant and light play of the imagination .

		They can not fail to interest all who hold in high esteem the work of the minister .

		They are the expression of successful service , and enter in a familiar man - ner into the secrets of its power . ''

		The Gospel for an Age of Doubt '' is also a volume of
Yale Lectures	ORGANIZATION	.

		It does not stand for quite as spontaneous , free , and varied a personal experience as the previous volume ; but it flows none the less with a strong , full current , from the heart of the man .

		It is an excellent representation of what we are having manifold examples of an effort to make the words and character of Christ the centre of belief and persuasion . ''

		The deep question , the important question , the question of widest interest , is what to preach to the men and women of to-day , to cheer them , to uplift them , to lead them back to faith and through faith to a brave , full , noble life '' -LRB- page VI . -RRB-

		.

		The volume has a finished form .

		The thought is quickened by a wide familiarity with stimulating religious literature , and supported by a voluminous appendix of excerpts .

		The author has spared no pains to make the lectures a suitable utterance of the overruling idea .

		They have a deep inspiration of faith which adapts them , not merely to those who preach Christ , but to all who believe in him .

		The volume on '' The Nicene Theology '' is com - posed of lectures given in the
Princeton Theological Seminary by Professor Scott of Chicago Theological Seminary	ORGANIZATION	.

		Their purpose is to establish the essen - tial soundness of that Christian development of doc - trine which issued in the
Council of Nice	ORGANIZATION	and the
Nicene Creed	ORGANIZATION	.

		The discussion is especially influ - enced by the distinctive criticism of
Schultz	PERSON	and others , separating the words of Christ from the doc - trinal and historical facts associated with them . '

		A recent critic of this position maintains that Bitschl lands in only three fundamental doctrines , namely , trust in God , faithfulness to duty , and uni - versal love to man '' -LRB- page 17 -RRB- .

		The cry in the - ology , Back to
Christ	LOCATION	, has much the same difficulty as the cry in philosophy , Back to
Kant	PERSON	.

		Neither of them is profitable as an exact direction .

		Both of them should mean a divesting of the mind of un - profitable subtleties , and returning to more practical spiritual ideas .

		Our wisdom lies not so much in going back to
Christ	LOCATION	, trying once more to construct the doctrinal force and exact historical settings of His words , as in going forward with Christ , appre - hending and fulfilling His regenerative purpose .

		We are to arrive at the heart of His doctrine by doing His will .

		A discussion which critically undoes past work in theology or critically does it over again is not going back to
Christ	LOCATION	as a spiritual power , but is a fresh casting of lots over His vest - ments .

		Christ becomes the plaything of philosophy , as a doll is the plaything of children who dress and undress it in endless sequence .

		Professor
Scott	PERSON	is erudite , and full of material , but he does not show much analytic and condensing power in presenting his subject .

		The less learned pupil would be quite sure to lose his way in this accumulation of state - ment and criticism .

		We are at a loss to understand why the opinions of every German every blessed one of them should be regarded as a new and important fact to be dealt with in theology .

		A generation so superheated by scholarship yields a good deal of very volatile matter .

		The two volumes entitled '' God the Creator and Lord of All '' are made up of eleven hundred and thirty compact pages .

		They discuss the nature of God , His creation , His government , physical and moral .

		The attitude of the author is one of mild orthodoxy .

		Reason , with him , underlies the entire framework of thoughts and things .

		The basis of his philosophy is intuitional .

		The work is carefully elaborated , and , without being brilliant or impres - sive , is full of sober thought .

		It neither goes astray nor leads astray .

		The work is a philosophy of our higher spiritual conceptions .

		While one would not venture to say that these volumes are the last of this species , he can not but feel that the species is one soon to disappear .

		It has already much fallen off since the twenty sound volumes of
Gerhard	PERSON	.

		Like some noble form of life that frequented the mountains or abounded on the plains , and in its own era drew at once the attention , but is now hard to be found , the systems of systematic theology which have followed each other in prolific generation no longer express the power nor claim the position that once fell to them .

		They are too much elaborated from within ; they are too exact and rigid in their conclusions ; they give more attention to the pro- cesses of thought than to the ever-growing data of thought , and often overlook data because they have found no sufficient place for them .

		The practical empirical side of life is nearer to us than ever , mak - ing its own demand on our speculative processes .

		The '' History of Christian Doctrine '' belongs to the '' International Theological Library . ''

		This itself is a promise of careful and adequate work , a promise the volume fulfils .

		A history of doctrine , like a history of philosophy , though the doctrines and the systems may disappear , always remains an intensely interesting record of human life .

		Such a history calls for keen insight and wide sympathy .

		The volume before us is comprehensive and com - pact .

		It is exceedingly full , and at the same time very concise .

		It is thus better fitted for reference ,
1897	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 73 and less fitted to make a single and forceful impres - sion .

		It treats of ancient , mediaeval , and modern theology .

		The last division is especially complete and interesting .

		The author enters into his narra - tive as one of living experiences , and gives it a biographical cast .

		The personal side attracts him quite as much as the speculative side .

		Professor
Fisher	PERSON	makes a distinction between theology and philosophy which is hardly satisfactory , and which affects somewhat his own presentation . ''

		The - ology discusses the facts of Christianity .

		Philos - ophy begins with the data of consciousness , and builds them into a system by a process in which historical events have no place . ''

		We should hold , rather , that the explanatory process is essentially the same in theology and in philosophy .

		The facts of Christianity must be rendered on their rational side as the basis of doctrine , and the data of con - sciousness must be interpreted as the experiences of mind in contact with the world , or they can give no safe footing to thought .

		Neither set of data can be separated from their historic evolution . ''

		Evil and Evolution '' is a noteworthy book .

		It is a piece of well-reasoned philosophy on the origin of evil .

		The presentation is clear , comprehensive , and penetrating .

		The author justly feels that the central idea the idea most of all to be watched over in a rational construction of the spiritual world is the conception of the character of God , the good - ness of God .

		If we lose or obscure this , all is doubt , confusion , fear .

		The writer returns to the concep - tion which has been so prevalent in faith , that of a perverse principle a Satanic Personality as the source of evil ; thus relieving the character of God from a burden not otherwise to be escaped .

		The point is argued with much fulness and large re - sources of physical knowledge .

		It is not made to rest on Christian faith or any phase of faith .

		The volume is one fitted to deeply interest those whose minds linger about such inquiries .

		It is in many ways suggestive , and is a good antidote to a dog - matic and flippant temper .

		Its conclusions are , however , so directly against the entire drift of speculative thought at present , that it will hardly do more than make a ripple .

		While there are many points of which one would desire to speak , we must satisfy ourselves with referring to two or three .

		The author , in common with a good many others , seems to us to misrender the omnipotence of God .

		Omnipotence can only mean the power to do what is capable of being done .

		It looks to physical re - sources .

		Omnipotence can not make one scheme of action to include the advantages of all schemes , nor enable it to escape the evils incident to it .

		A scheme is to be judged by its entire makeup of tendencies .

		These are not capable of every combination , but only of certain combinations .

		The question con - cerning the Spiritual Universe is not whether it includes evil , but whether , taken as one whole , it is an inadmissible combination of good and evil .

		The evil must in every case be weighed with the good with which it is associated .

		The author would not deny this assertion , but he has not felt its full force .

		Nor does the writer feel , as fully as he ought , the present entire coherence of the spiritual world , rendering any intervention of Satan , any conflict between the two Principles of Evil and Good , inadmissible .

		The world is being rid of evil , but by exactly the same processes as those which include it .

		The author makes too much of happiness as happiness .

		He is in the empirical slough on that subject .

		Selfishness and love extend down to the vegetable kingdom .

		His new adjustments would primarily make the world more pleasurable , not more spiritually power - ful ; would give it an instinctive and organic cast , not a free and holy one .

		The dramatic power of the spiritual world is not adequately rendered by him . ''

		The Philosophy of Belief '' is the most imposing volume of our present series .

		It stands associated with and in completion of '' The Reign of Law '' and '' The Unity of Nature '' by the same author .

		The characteristic of all three books is their vigorous hold of the physical world on the one hand , and of the spiritual world on the other .

		Very few authors pursue so unswerving a path between science and faith ; few so well apprehend the unity of the world as a physical and spiritual product .

		The present vol - ume lays emphasis on the spiritual side of life , dis - closes it as thoroughly interwoven in the framework of things , and as immutable in its leading principles as are the physical laws with which it is associated .

		The spiritual world is as much a part of the entire world as are the atmosphere and sunlight and clouds of the earth they enclose .

		The topics of the volume are intuitive theology in which the interlock of perceptive and intuitive truths is traced , the the - ology of the Hebrews and Christian theology in which spiritual principles find fullest expression , and Christian belief in its relation to philosophy .

		The style of the author is voluminous and discur - sive , but the thought is easily intelligible , and gains great cumulative power .

		To those who at all share the convictions of the writer , the unmistakable and eternal foundations of truth seem to be disclosed .

		He thus defines the purpose of philosophy : '' But we must never forget that the original meaning of the word denotes no less than the love and desire of knowledge in that largest sense which is identified with the pursuit of Wisdom .

		It represents the constant struggle and desire of men to bring their own thoughts and conceptions more and more into conscious corre - spondence with the system of the universe in which they live .

		There can be no higher aim than this .

		It affords room for the exercise of all the most powerful faculties we possess .

		It is an aim which not only must include theology , but must regard it as the central and ultimate object of attainment .

		If there be a universe at all , the great endeavor of philosophy must be to conceive how its unity can be made intelligible , and on the other hand to understand how it is that , in some aspects , it so often appears as if it were divided . ''

		Philosophy and religion both rest on the intelligi - bility pervasive and complete of the world in which we are .

		74 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		lish literature Professor
Edward Dowden	PERSON	's Prince - a * affected by the ton lectures upon '' The French Revo - French Revolution .

		lution and English Literature '' have been published in a neat volume -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , and make interesting reading , although they traverse exceedingly familiar ground , and bring to their sub - ject in the way of illumination little that is new .

		In this respect they are something of a disappoint - ment ; for we have a right to expect much of Pro- fessor
Dowden	PERSON	in the way of interpretative comment and philosophical treatment .

		We get , however , little of these things , but instead a straightforward history of revolutionary thought in
England	LOCATION	, begin - ning with the precursors and theorists of the move - ment , with
Cowper	PERSON	and the author of ''
Sandf	ORGANIZATION	ord and
Merton	PERSON	, '' with
Godwin	PERSON	and
Mary Wollstone	PERSON	- craft , going on with the conservative reaction so eloquently championed by
Burke	PERSON	, and finally dis - cussing the effect of the new ideas upon
Burns	PERSON	,
Southey	PERSON	,
Coleridge	PERSON	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	, and
Landor	ORGANIZATION	.

		The subject is of so intense an inherent interest that a dull book could hardly be made of it , and nothing akin to dulness may be predicated of the book before us .

		It is simply sober rather than brilliant , although it now and then , in some epi - grammatic sentence , almost partakes of the latter quality .

		It is pleasant to be told of eighteenth century sentimentalism that '' the first of duties was no longer to act aright , but to be touched by a deli - cate distress . ''

		Likewise there is point in saying that '' the gospel of
Rousseau	ORGANIZATION	is translated by Cow - per into the gospel according to St.
Paul	PERSON	, '' and in the statement that '' whether
Burke	PERSON	help us to under - stand the Revolution or not , assuredly the Revolu - tion should help us to understand
Burke	PERSON	. ''

		Here is a very judicial estimate of Byron : '' To acquire a right feeling for
Byron	PERSON	and his poetry is a discipline in equity .

		It is easy to yield to a sense of his power , to the force and sweep of his genius ; it is easy to be repelled by his superficial insincerity , his license , his cynicism , his poverty of thought , his looseness of construction , his carelessness in execution . ''

		And there is food for ample reflection in such a passage as the following , which contrasts the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	heroes and heroines of Byron once so very much alive and now so completely dead with certain popular figures in recent works of fiction , such as
Robert Elsmere	LOCATION	and Dodo . ''

		Perhaps
Nora Helmer	PERSON	and
Hedda Gabler	PERSON	may by and by repose in the old marionette box , and the wires by which their limbs are convulsed may have grown rusty ; perhaps the sawdust already escapes from a clerical garb that was so fresh a few years since ; perhaps a sprightly heroine of two or three seasons ago is no longer so atrociously sprightly . ''

		There is little in the main line of Professor
Dowden	PERSON	's thought that will not find general critical acceptance , but we are some - what surprised to find him saying that ''
Shelley	PERSON	, unlike
Wordsworth	PERSON	, and unlike
Coleridge	PERSON	, was defi - cient in the power of original thought . ''

		Can one be so sure of that , when we consider how rare a thing '' original thought '' must always be ?

		Strictly speaking , is there so very much of it in
Wordsworth	LOCATION	and
Coleridge	PERSON	?

		And is it fair to say that
Shelley	PERSON	does not produce the impression of a forceful thinker -LRB- setting aside as practically insoluble the question of originality -RRB- in almost as marked a de - gree as either of the others ?

		He was less than thirty when he died , to be sure , while the others lived on into the time of ripeness , and this fact alone makes the comparison a trifle unfair ; but the real difficulty seems to be that some people find exact thought incompatible with melodious utterance .

		One gift should be enough for a poet , and the poet who presumes to think should remain rugged in his utterance .

		The same preconception has , in our own day , discredited the intellectual force of Mr.
Swin	PERSON	- burne , and given rise to the curious notion that
Browning	PERSON	was a more profound and exact thinker than
Tennyson	LOCATION	.

		_ Buddhism A - voluntary association of gentlemen sympathetically interested in the study of religions expounded .

		invited Professor
Rhys Davids	PERSON	to deliver a series of lectures upon Buddhism , which have been printed in a neat volume of 230 pages , under the title , '' Buddhism , Its History and Liter - ature '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		The keynote of the exposition is a thorough sympathy with the Buddhistic explana - tion of the universe and
Buddha	ORGANIZATION	's panacea for all its woes .

		This fact , coupled with Professor
Davids	PERSON	's ample and exact knowledge of his field , makes the contents of the book interesting and profitable read - ing .

		The treatment is somewhat too brief to be altogether satisfactory who could present
Chris	PERSON	- tianity adequately in two hundred pages ?

		But the writer has succeeded in putting forth with clearness and force his own conception of the salient features of this fascinating religious system .

		He is an advocate of the originality of Buddha in his psy - chological and ethical positions , and contrasts the traditionalism of the rest of the world , which is still bound in the fetters of the primitive '' soul '' theory .

		Of course , one does not look for criticism of Bud - dhism in these lectures , though they are , so far , it would seem , defective .

		How anyone can trace the history of Buddhism without a critical estimate of its defects is hard to understand .

		But Professor
Davids	PERSON	successfully accomplishes even this .

		He is an optimist with respect to both the past and the future of Buddhism .

		Cooper is at his best in out-of-door stories .

		When , in an ill-advised hour , jje set himself to berating the Amer - ican people for their imperfections as judged by European standards , he was repaid with the outcry of disturbed complacency , an outcry which might be to-day translated , without losing force , into a crit - ical dictum against these damnatory works as litera - ture .

		Similar treatment has been accorded `` Martin Chuzzlewit , '' and might well be extended to Mr.
Kip	PERSON	- ling 's '' American Notes , '' both of which sketches of Revival of a forgotten work by
Cooper	PERSON	.

		1897 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 75 American life lack that essential part of truth which lies in observing facts in their due proportion .

		And so some persons may question whether , after all , the reprinting of the '' Autobiography of a Pocket - Handkerchief '' -LRB- The
Golden Booke Press	ORGANIZATION	,
Evans	PERSON	- ton , 111 . -RRB-

		is worth while .

		Certainly Mr.
Walter Lee Brown	PERSON	has done his full duty in his laborious foot - notes of the variant readings found in the three printed forms of
1843	DATE	; and corrected by compari - son with the original manuscript , fortunately at hand .

		It is evident from these foot-notes that
Cooper	PERSON	was more painstaking in his revision than he is usually given credit for .

		It appears , however , that the first half of this volume was more carefully re-read than the somewhat slovenly and hurried remainder .

		One asks if there was a '' period of French influence '' in American letters at this time , for the characters affect French terms in their con - versation , and even the descriptive passages are be - spattered with French phrases .

		Yet the story is distinctly better than many amateur compositions or similar subjects , and , as the publishers say in their advertisement , here is an opportunity to com - plete your set of Cooper an opportunity never before offered by an American publisher .

		It is but just to add that the book is made attractive enough in appearance , and handsome enough in its heavy paper , to open the purse of any bibliophile suscep - tible to such blandishment .

		All by
Mark Twain	PERSON	.

		The eight pieces in
Mark Twain	PERSON	's `` How to Tell a Story , and other Essays '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- may be classified as follows : Two are professional recollections of a professional humorist ; two are appropriations , by the same humorist , of material which the literary critic has commonly thought of as his own property ; one is a seizing of that inestimable privilege of the humorist , the utterance of true wisdom ; one is a collection of material for the Society for the Pro- motion of
Psychical Research	ORGANIZATION	; two are subversions of the opinions of M.
Paul Bourget	PERSON	and Mr.
Max O'Rell	PERSON	.

		Of these , '' Travelling with a Reformer '' has long been sealed with the seal of universal ap - proval : the essay is a good thing , and a service to the American people .

		It is also very funny in places , as , indeed , are the other essays , though why '' essays '' it would be hard to say .

		The two rambles of the professional humorist are of course humorous , but they have so much professionalism about them as to be a trifle wearisome , at least to such as like to have a little spontaneity in life .

		The two invasions of literary territory , '' In Defence of
Harriet Shelley	PERSON	'' and an indictment of
James Feni	PERSON	- more
Cooper	PERSON	, will suffer , we fear , from being found in company with the '' Jumping Frog '' and the '' Golden Arm . ''

		They will not generally be regarded as contributions to critical literature , although the first , we think , holds the right ground , and the second says some very sensible things .

		The articles on
Paul Bourget	PERSON	's book throw light on what is already the most ancient of history , that of the day before yesterday .

		The examples of mental tele - pathy should be filed away for future reference and further information on the subject .

		Such are the separate parts of a book which is all by
Mark Twain	PERSON	, a matter far more important than the particular facts just communicated .

		We hope that the author will soon offer us a companion volume entitled '' How to Write an Essay , and other Stories . ''

		Evolution of the stars .

		Under the title , '' Researches on the Evolution of Stellar Systems '' -LRB-
Nich	ORGANIZATION	- ols Press ,
Lynn	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	-RRB- , Professor
T. J. J. See	PERSON	, of the
Lowell Astronomical Observa	ORGANIZATION	- tory , presents a compilation of researches valuable to the student of physical astronomy , but not to be recommended to the layman for seaside reading .

		Prefacing with a general account of double-star investigations '' from
Herschel to Burnham	PERSON	, '' and an acute mathematical discussion of the methods by which delicate observations are translated into de - lineations or orbits , Professor See has collated the observations , wherever made , upon forty binary stars , and presents the diagrams of their orbits .

		In each case , a star in the remote heavens , found to be separable into components only by telescopes of the finest definition when used by eyes of the acutest perception , has been by various persons separately observed , and the relative distances of the com - panion from its central sun have been determined , as well as its corresponding angular positions .

		These data , duly discussed and accurately platted , show that the companion moves in a planetary orbit about a masterful central body , and that the laws of gravitation , as discovered by
Newton	PERSON	and form - ulated by
Kepler	PERSON	, are dominant at those remote distances in the celestial universe as certainly as where the moon cycles its monthly circuit about the earth , and the planets weave their annual tracery upon the Zodiac .

		Conclusions of this sort produce the prof oundest impression upon the unprofessional reader .

		Professor
Harold W. Johnston	PERSON	, of the
University of Indiana	ORGANIZATION	, has done a very timely service to the cause of classical study by the preparation of a volume on `` Latin Manuscripts '' -LRB-
Scott , Foresman & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It is true that the pupils in our secondary schools , and even in our colleges , can come into contact with Latin literature only in printed editions , but many questions arise in the minds of such pupils as to the production and transmission of Latin books , and it is well that the answers to such questions should be put into accessible form .

		The subject is treated under three heads , the History of the Man - uscripts , the
Science of Palaeography	ORGANIZATION	, and
the Science of Criticism	ORGANIZATION	.

		The book is copiously illus - trated by reproductions of pages from famous manuscripts , among them the '' Codex Romanus '' of Catullus , which had lain hidden from the learned world under a mistaken classification in the
Vatican Library	ORGANIZATION	, and was brought to light during the past year by Professor
Hale	PERSON	of the
University of Chi	ORGANIZATION	- Latin classict in original manuscript .

		76 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, cago .

		Perhaps the book would have been im - proved if a larger number of the critical processes described had been illustrated by concrete ex - amples ; but it is sufficiently plain to serve a good purpose in the hands of Latin teachers , and no such teacher should be without it unless he is provided with something more extensive in the same line .

		Literature of mutic .

		Although music was the first of the arts to possess a special dictionary of its own , no classification of the works most useful to the student in the principal departments of musical literature has been in ex - istence .

		This want has now been supplied by Mr.
James E. Matthew	PERSON	in his work on '' The Literature of Music '' -LRB-
Armstrong	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The first five chapters of this work trace the principal objects with which musical literature occupied itself in the different countries of
Europe	LOCATION	down to the end of the eigh - teenth century .

		The remaining six chapters con - sider some of the special branches into which it has been directed , under the headings : Histories of Music , Dictionaries of Music , The Literature of Sacred Music , The Literature of the Opera , The Literature of
Musical Instruments	ORGANIZATION	, The Literature of Music as a Science .

		Thus an inquirer in any one of these fields is furnished with an admirable guide showing how and where to go for the books which are of special interest and up-to-date , as well as those which are notable either for their curiosity , their scarceness , or for the important influence they have exercised in a past age .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		The average buyer and reader of books , even when he imagines himself an ardent '' book-lover , '' is too apt to be ignorant of the proper methods of handling and caring for his volumes .

		He will handle a book as he does his newspaper , and care for it as he might for a brick or a block of wood .

		In an attempt to dispel some of this ignorance , Mr.
Arthur L. Humphreys	PERSON	, a member of the great
London	LOCATION	bookselling firm of ''
Hatchards	PERSON	, '' has written an excellent little volume entitled '' The Private Library What we Do Know , What we Do n't Know , What we Ought to Know , about our Books '' -LRB-
London	LOCATION	: Strange ways & Sons -RRB- .

		In addition to much sound practical advice on the care and treatment of books , the arrangement of libraries , etc. , Mr.
Hum	PERSON	- phreys writes pleasantly on many such subjects as '' Book Values , '' '' The Art of Reading , '' '' Old Country Libra - ries , '' '' Book Hobbies , '' etc. .

		In print , paper , and bind - ing , the volume should please the most fastidious .

		In ''
Cuba	LOCATION	in War Time '' -LRB-
R. H. Russell	PERSON	-RRB- , Mr.
Richard Harding Davis	PERSON	expresses his contempt for the numerous '' Cuban war-correspondents '' so-called , who , while pop - ularly supposed to be in the midst of the fray on the island , are in reality turning out their '' copy '' from the security of
Florida	LOCATION	hotel piazzas .

		There are rumors afloat that Mr.
Davis	PERSON	's own war sketches , contained in the present volume , were produced in this way ; but we think any impartial reader of his book will readily acquit him of the charge .

		Although nothing more than a collection of newspaper sketches , Mr.
Davis	PERSON	's book is graphic and interesting , and from it may be gained a very good idea of the present condition of affairs on the ill-fated island .

		Mr.
Frederic Remington	PERSON	, who accom - panied Mr.
Davis	PERSON	on his trip to
Cuba	LOCATION	, contributes a number of illustrations to the volume , which , with a few exceptions , are sensational and poorly - drawn .

		In '' The Aurora Borealis '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- ,
M. Alfred Angot	PERSON	, of the
Central Meteorological Office	ORGANIZATION	of
France	LOCATION	, gives a concise resume of the history of these always interesting and often strikingly beautiful phenomena , illusive and evanescent meteors of the upper air .

		Facts are stated and illustrated and explanatory theories are discussed .

		With most modern physicists , the author prefers that which recognizes in the aurora a mani - festation of electric energy , active in the upper atmos - phere and most frequently in polar latitudes , but ad - mits that much remains in this field to be explained or discovered .

		The volume closes with a list of all re - corded auroras since
1700	DATE	.

		Mr.
J. N. Lamed	PERSON	, editor of the successful '' History for Ready Reference '' and Public Librarian of
Buffalo	LOCATION	, has printed `` A Talk about Books '' -LRB-
Peter Paul Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- originally addressed to a body of high school stu - dents .

		It is pleasantly written and contains much sound and sensible advice about reading .

		It may be warmly recommended to the attention of young persons and their parents , being the same sort of thing , in spirit if not in eloquence , as Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	's '' The Choice of Books '' and Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	's lecture '' On
King	PERSON	's Treas - uries . ''

		Rev.
Jenkin Lloyd Jones	PERSON	, who some years ago pub - lished a pamphlet entitled `` Ten Great Novels , '' the outcome of correspondence with a number of critical readers , has now sought to obtain a similar consensus of opinion in the field of poetry . ''

		Ten Noble Poems '' is the title of the pamphlet now issued , and it contains lists and explanatory letters from sixty-seven corre - spondents .

		The poems were to be measured by '' the test of poetic form , ethical insight , and spiritual inspira - tion . ''

		Wordsworth 's '' Intimations '' gets the largest vote , followed by '' In Memoriam , '' ''
Saul	PERSON	, '' and Gray 's `` Elegy . ''

		No less than two hundred and thirty-eight poems are named altogether .

		The pamphlet makes very interesting reading .

		Professor
Ralph S. Tarr	PERSON	publishes , through the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	, a '' First Book of Physical Geography , '' a treatise for still younger students than those for whom the author 's '' Elementary Physical Geography '' was designed .

		This is the third text-book produced recently by Professor
Tarr	PERSON	, and has the admirable qualities of clearness and strictly scientific method that characterize its predecessors .

		The illustrations are numerous and attractive , helping out the text in a highly satisfactory way .

		The Literary Year-Book '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- , edited for
1897	DATE	by Mr.
F. G. Aflalo	PERSON	, is a venture of a new sort , and must be judged leniently .

		Its contents consist of liter - ary causeries , alternating with portraits and biographical sketches of writers who have recently come to the fore .

		This reading-matter is distinctly readable , although any - thing but profound .

		The reference features of the book include a literary calendar for the year , lists of public libraries and literary clubs in
England	LOCATION	, and very useful -LRB- although far from complete -RRB- directories of British authors , publishers , and booksellers .

		Altogether it is a useful compendium and one to be recommended to bookmen of all sorts .

		1897 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 77 LITERARY NOTES .

		Mr.
E. W. Porter	PERSON	, of
St. Paul	ORGANIZATION	, publishes a pretty text of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's '' Omar , '' with the various readings of the four editions .

		Messrs.
Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish an '' Elementary Arith - metic , '' by Mr.
William W. Speer	PERSON	, Assistant Superin - tendent of the
Chicago	LOCATION	public schools .

		Two new volumes in the '' Centenary '' edition of Car - lyle have just been published by Messrs.
Charles Scrib	PERSON	- ner 's Sons .

		They are two of the four which will contain the complete ''
Cromwell	PERSON	. ''

		It is said that Professor
W. I. Knapp	PERSON	's long-expected life of
George Borrow	ORGANIZATION	will be ready for publication in the
Autumn	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dr.
Knapp	PERSON	is probably the most learned of living Borrovians , and has traced the wanderings of his scholar-gypsy all over
Spain	LOCATION	.

		The doctoral dissertation of Miss
Ellen C. Hinsdale	PERSON	, daughter of Professor
B. A. Hinsdale	PERSON	of
Ann Arbor	PERSON	, is entitled : ''
Ueber	PERSON	die Wiedergabe der Lateinischen Futurums bei den Althochdeutschen Uebersetzern des 8.-10 .

		Jahrhunderts . ''

		It is printed at
Gottingen	LOCATION	, at which university
Miss Hinsdale	LOCATION	took her degree .

		The
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	have sent us
Volume III	ORGANIZATION	.

		of Montaigne and Volume IV .

		of the '' Morte d' Arthur '' in their `` Temple Classics , ''
Heywood	PERSON	's `` A Woman Killed with Kindness '' in their '' Temple Dramatists , '' '' Lost Illusions '' in their edition of Balzac , ''
Snarley	PERSON	- yow '' in their collection of standard English novels , and '' Dream Tales '' in their edition of the novels of Tour - gue `` nieff .

		The death of Mrs.
Oliphant	PERSON	last month has been fol - lowed by the death , on
July 20	DATE	, of Miss
Jean Ingelow	PERSON	, a woman whose poetical reputation was once consider - able , but seems to have declined of recent years , although a few of her pieces are still among the most generally familiar in the English language .

		Her several novels once had a considerable vogue but are now almost wholly forgotten .

		Several scholars in
Japan	LOCATION	are now making a special study of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	.

		Among them is the Rev.
Masahisa Uyemura	PERSON	, who is said to have under contemplation the composition of an essay on the great Italian poet .

		A society under the title of ''
Danate Kenkyukwai	PERSON	, '' an association for studying
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's writings , is likely to be organized by the admirers of the poet .

		These interest - ing facts are furnished by the ''
Japan	LOCATION	Times . ''

		It is with great pleasure that we note the unanimity with which all the periodicals that stand for an enlight - ened civilization have expressed their condemnation of the President 's appointment of a new Librarian of Con - gress .

		Instead of selecting a professional librarian for this important post -LRB- assuming that Mr.
Spofford	PERSON	was to be displaced -RRB- a politician with no qualification whatever for the work is chosen , presumably at the dictation of some local '' boss . ''

		We did not expect that President
McKinley	PERSON	would deal civil service reform such a slap in the face as this , and his protestations of friendship for the movement must hereafter be taken subject to a considerable discount .

		We are glad to state that the new tariff law of the
United States	LOCATION	, objectionable as it is in many of its fea - tures , does not embody the crowning atrocity of a tax upon all kinds of books .

		The provisions of the old law are substantially retained , leaving untaxed all books for public institutions , all books printed in foreign lan - guages , and all English books more than twenty years old .

		Even such a
Congress	ORGANIZATION	as that now in office found itself unable to ignore the unanimous protest made by all who represent intelligent public opinion when the
Dingley	PERSON	tax upon education was first bruited , and in this matter , at least , the law has not taken a step backward .

		The shameful tax upon art , however , has been made a part of the law , and refutes any idea that our latest tariff-makers could have had the interests of civilization really at heart . ''

		The Century '' for
September	DATE	will make the follow - ing announcement : '' With the aim of encouraging literary activity among col - lege graduates , ' The Century Magazine ' offers to give , during four successive years , three prizes of

		A New Historical Novel by Mrs.

		A SON OF THE OLD DOMINION .

		Price ,
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		`` Mrs.
Harrison	PERSON	has inhaled the very spirit of Virginian life in ante-Revolution days , and not so much penned it as exhaled it upon the pages of this delightful book .

		... It is without question Mrs.
Harrison	PERSON	's best work , and as a study in American historical literature , though of a later date , deserves a place by the side of Mr.
Stimson	PERSON	's ` King Noanett . ' ''

		Boston Transcript . ''

		We heartily recommend it to our readers as one of the best light historical stories recently published .

		It secures attention at once , and holds it firmly to the end : moves fast enough , yet turns aside into pleasant nooks of Old Dominion customs , religions , politics , and at the close leaves the reader better acquainted with an important period of American colonial history , and highly pleased with the outcome of the main thing , the sweet and pure love-story running all the way through the book , with a very captivating ripple of its own .

		Mr.
H. M. S. van Wickevoort Crommelin	PERSON	, in summarizing the literary activity of the twelvemonth in
Holland	LOCATION	, remarks that '' some of our younger novelists are more struck by the problems which life offers than by their influ - ence on man .

		They attempt to analyze doubt , dejection , hereditary crime ; they show the wan - ing influence of moral and religious principles , and the great mass of superficial thinkers , of which the reading public largely consists , revels in this very modern work , which is recom - mended by its agreeable form . ''

		He instances in support of this thesis such books as Mr.
Adema	PERSON	's '' Wormstekigen , '' Miss
Lohman	PERSON	's '' Vragensmolde , '' Mr.
van Doorne	PERSON	's `` Twij - fel , '' and Mr.
Coenen	PERSON	's ''
Een Zwakke	PERSON	. ''

		This last work , the gloomy and depressing tale of a cowardly suicide , is said to be '' the last word of realism . ''

		To the question , '' Will romanti - cism revive ? ''

		the writer replies : '' I have to chronicle two novels and one dramatic poem which are all but romantic . ''

		In '' Drogon , '' by Mr.
van Schendel	PERSON	, '' we meet with the man who scorns worldly power , and whose ideal is to find the ' Ring of Jesus . '

		The wisdom this ring carries with it he hopes to impart to mankind . ''

		In '' Irmenlo , '' by Mr.
van Oordt	PERSON	, '' the conflict between heathenism and
Christendom	LOCATION	in the
Middle Ages	LOCATION	is treated with singular dramatic power . ''

		The poem referred to is '' Lioba , '' by Mr.
van Eeden	PERSON	.

		The author '' has with this work captivated once more the hearts of his countrymen .

		It marks a considerable advance in his artistic development , being much more truly poetical and less philosophical than his recent works .

		The influence of the great mas - ters , of
Swinburne	LOCATION	and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, is unmis - takable ; the descriptions of nature are equal to those of our best modern poets , and in many parts the writer surpasses our great seventeenth century poet
Vondel	PERSON	, of whom he often reminds us . ''

		On the whole , Dutch poetry keeps rather ahead of Flemish , and '' the literary regenera - tion in the north has been followed by no equal movement on the part of our southern neigh - bors . ''

		Other works of fiction are ''
Jeanne Col	PERSON	- 84 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, lette , '' described as '' a big anti-Semitic novel in two volumes , '' by Mr.
Willem Paap	PERSON	; and '' Metamorfose , '' a '' dissection of a modern nov - elist , '' by Mr.
Couperus	PERSON	, '' whose delicate writ - ing is one of the features of to-day . ''

		The most important of learned works are Dr. van
Deven	PERSON	- ter 's '' Hellenic Studies , '' and Professor Mul - ler 's ''
Onze Gouden Eeuw	PERSON	'' of Dutch history .


Herr Leopold Katscher	PERSON	's article on
Hungary	LOCATION	begins with a long list of publications called forth by the millennial celebration .

		These include Mr.
Szilagyi	PERSON	's '' Millennial History of
Hungary	LOCATION	, '' Mr.
Beothy	PERSON	's histories of Hungarian literature , Mr.
Laurencic	PERSON	's '' The Mellennium of
Hungary	LOCATION	and the
National Exhibition	ORGANIZATION	, '' and Mr.
Ferencczi	PERSON	's life of Petbfi .

		In fiction , Mr.
Jokai	PERSON	has been silent , but Mr.
Herczeg	PERSON	has pub - lished two volumes , '' Szabolcs ' Marriage , '' and '' The First Swallow . ''

		There are also the '' Sep - tember '' of Mr.
Ambrus	PERSON	, `` our bitterest scep - tic , '' and books by Mr.
Szomahazy	PERSON	, '' one of the best among our lighter storytellers , '' Mr.
Brody	PERSON	, `` our leading realist , '' and Mr.
Timar	PERSON	, `` a young and able writer . ''

		As for poetry , Mr.
Endrbdi	PERSON	's ''
Kurucz	PERSON	Songs '' come first . ''

		None of our poetry since Petbf i 's has appealed to our patriotism with such force and perfection as this splendid production . ''

		There are young poets in
Hungary	LOCATION	as elsewhere , and among them are mentioned
Baron Nikolics de Rudna	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Fer	PERSON	- encz
Martos	PERSON	, and Mr.
Emil Makai	PERSON	.

		The most popular play of the year has been a translation of '' Trilby '' !

		Scholarly publications include a history of Italian Literature by Mr.
Antal Rado	PERSON	, a collection of essays by Mr.
Diner	PERSON	- Denes , and an '' Old Hungarian Library '' of critical annotated texts , started under the edi - torship of Professor
Gustav Heinrich	PERSON	.

		Signer
Giuseppe Giacosa	PERSON	, writing of
Italy	LOCATION	, says that during the year '' most of our greatest writers have either produced little or nothing , or published works not of a purely literary char - acter . ''

		Despite this fact , however , the article proves to be of considerable interest , and tempts to fuller illustration than we have space here to give . ''

		In poetry , the influence of
Carducci	PERSON	and d'Annunzio is less marked than formerly .

		Nor , notwithstanding the vogue of the French and
Belgium	LOCATION	symbolists , has the lily of mystical aspiration hitherto flourished among us .

		Faith - ful in this respect to its traditions , the lyric poetry of
Italy	LOCATION	has no affinity for the occult . ''

		Among volumes of new poetry may be men - tioned Signer Vitali 's sonnets on the '' Epopea del Risorgimento , ''
Signer Rossi	PERSON	's '' Ore Cam - pestri , '' and the `` Nuovi Versi '' of the late
Contessa Lara	ORGANIZATION	.

		A very recent small volume of verse entitled '' Madre , '' by
Signer Cena	PERSON	, impels the writer to hail a new poet , and to say : '' For some years past I have read no verses of such pure and continuous inspiration . '' ''

		The novel is developing in two different directions under the influence of two powerful minds .

		D'Annun - zio has founded a school ; Fogazzaro has inspired , not disciples , but followers .

		The formal qualities of the first are , in part at least , of a kind easily acquired , while the intense inward fevour of the second attracts to him none but spirits already kindled .

		Both are idealists : Fogazzaro through his passion for the ideal , d'Annun - zio through the habit of idealization .

		Fogazzaro contem - plates life in its reality and complexity ; there is no person too insignificant , no action too trifling for him to regard it as material for art ; yet there breathes through - out every one of his writings a vivid transcendentalism , indicating that he yearns and strives after an unseen world after some supersensual good ,
D'Annunzio	PERSON	thinks nothing worthy of artistic treatment but himself , and himself not in as far as he resembles the rest of humanity , but in those points wherein he differs from them .

		By dint of collecting and refining with wonderful mastery his own sensations , and making of them , as it were , the pivot of the universe , he has attained to an idealized sensuality , a wantonness of the intellect , in which he places the quintessence of life and the nobility of human nature , as shown by his .

		recognizing in those so endowed the right of ruling over other men .

		D'An - nunzio will take a permanent place in our literary his - tory , but his literary influence will have benefited those only who admire him without wishing to take him as a model .

		It is a good thing to have noted in his verse and in his prose the capacity of the Italian language for renewed and genuine freshness and for the most inti - mate actuality , but only so far as it encourages every one to carry on for himself the task of linguistic puri - fication , seeking for himself at first hand , guided by his own inclinations and his own aims . ''

		The new works of fiction chiefly noted are '' La Morte di Orfeo '' and ''
Roberta	PERSON	, '' by
Signor Zuccoli	PERSON	; '' L'Incantesimo , '' by
Signor Butti	PERSON	; '' La Signorina X. di X , '' a philosophical novel published anonymously ; '' La Prova , '' by Sig - nora di Luanto ; and '' L'Arauleto , '' by the writer who signs herself '' Neera . ''

		The '' most interesting book of the year '' is stated to be '' L' Europa Giovane , '' by
Signor Ferrero	PERSON	, the sociologist .

		In this book '' he collects the im - pressions and observations gathered on a jour - ney through
Europe	LOCATION	, and especially during his stay at
Berlin	LOCATION	,
London	LOCATION	, and
Moscow	LOCATION	.

		Though not fond of diffuse word-painting , which , on the contrary , he avoids as far as possible , his delineation of things , actions , and people is clear and definite .

		Ferrero possesses in an eminent degree the artistic faculty of seizing on salient points , of marshalling them in brief and effec - tive sentences , and of embodying them in vivid images . ''

		Other works of a serious character are a continuation of the facsimile reproduc -
1897	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 85 tion of Leonardo da
Vinci	PERSON	's ''
Codex Atlanti	PERSON	- cus '' ; Dr.
Ridella	PERSON	's ''
Una Sventura Postuma	PERSON	di
Giacomo Leopardi	PERSON	, '' clearing the poet 's memory from the calumnies of
Ranieri	PERSON	; the two volumes of the work entitled `` Per Antonio llosmini nel Primo Centenario dalla
Sua Nas	PERSON	- cita '' ; and
Signor Negri	PERSON	's ''
Meditazioni Vaga	PERSON	- bonde , '' a volume of religio-philosophical es - says , which '' treat metaphysics pretty much as Eenan treated the character of Christ . ''

		The Norwegian '' books of the year '' have , of course , been Dr.
Nansen	PERSON	's account of his Arctic expedition and Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	's ''
John Gabriel Borkman	PERSON	. ''


Herr C. Brinchmann	PERSON	, who is our annalist , takes these two books as too well known to need any description .


Herr Bjornson	PERSON	has published nothing , but
Herr	PERSON	Lie has produced '' Dyre Rein , '' and
Herr Garborg '' Laeraren	PERSON	, '' both of these works being dis - tinctly problem-novels .

		Other fiction includes
Herr Obstfelder	PERSON	's `` Korset , ''
Herr Krag	PERSON	's
Ada Wilde	PERSON	, ''
Herr Kinck	PERSON	's Sus , '' and
Herr Tryggve Andersen	PERSON	's '' I
Kancelliraaden	PERSON	's Dage , '' '' a grand historical novel . ''

		The re - mainder of this article is devoted chiefly to Dr.
Bing	PERSON	's '' Tider og Idealer , '' a treatise on French ideals in painting and literature ; a new edition of
Wergeland	LOCATION	, edited by his latest champion ,
Herr Naerup	PERSON	; a new translation of
Snorre Storlasson	PERSON	, the work of Professor Storm ; and a monograph on '' Helge-Digtene i den ^
Eldre Edda	PERSON	, '' by Professor
Sophus Bugge	PERSON	. ''

		Following his revolutionary , and hence much - impugned , opinions on the origin of the Norse myths , he has also in this instance employed his vast learning to place the very core and centre of Northern heroic myths among the settlements of the Norsemen , surrounded by
Kelts	PERSON	and Anglo-Saxons , in the British Isles . ''

		Contemporary Polish literature , for most readers outside of
Poland	LOCATION	, is summed up in the one name of
Henryk Sienkiewicz	PERSON	.

		This name , however , does not occur in Professor
Adam Belcikowski	PERSON	's summary of the year , but we have instead the unfamiliar names of Mr.
Boleslaw Prus	PERSON	, author of `` The Pharaoh , '' Mr.
Przy	PERSON	- borowski , author of '' The Knight
Mora	PERSON	, '' Mr.
Choinski	PERSON	, author of '' The Last Romans , '' Mr.
Gawalewicz	PERSON	, author of '' Belonging to Nobody , '' and a long list of other writers with other works of fiction .

		The remainder of the paper is little more than a catalogue of the more noteworthy books of poetry , drama , history , and biography .

		The annals of literary
Russia	LOCATION	are told at great length by Mr.
L. A. de Bogdanovitch	PERSON	, who mentions few names of which English readers have ever heard .

		Most contemporary literature in
Russia	LOCATION	sees the light in the monthly reviews , on account of the special conditions of the book-market and the risks involved in any more permanent form of publication .

		Among the few actual books described are the follow - ing : '' The Russian Novel and Russian So - ciety , '' by Mr.
K. Golovin	PERSON	; some extremely pessimistic '' Thoughts on the
Essential Points of Public Activity	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Professor
Kareieff	PERSON	; and the '' splendid '' biography of
A. S. Kho	PERSON	- miakoff , the theologian , by Mr.
V. N. Lias	PERSON	- kovsky .

		Various novels , published as serials in the reviews , are discussed in the closing half of the paper .


Spain	LOCATION	is the last country in the `` Athenaeum '' list , since
Sweden	LOCATION	is for some unexplained rea - son ignored , and works in history and other departments of serious scholarship form , as in past years , the substance of the report .

		Don
Rafael Altamira	PERSON	writes the article , and singles out the following three historical works as being of the greatest importance : The '' History of the Social Institutions of
Gothic Spain	LOCATION	, '' by
D. Eduardo Perez Pujol	PERSON	; '' The Despatches of the Pontificial Diplomatists in
Spain	LOCATION	, '' by
D. Ricardo de Hinojosa	PERSON	; and the second volume of the ''
Spanish Navy	ORGANIZATION	from the Union of the Kingdoms of
Castile	LOCATION	and Aragon , '' by
Senor Fernandez Duro	ORGANIZATION	.

		Two works of great interest to the student of literature are thus described : ''
Senor Perez	PERSON	Pastor 's ' Documentos Cervantinos hasta ahora IneMitos ' contains more than fifty docu - ments , notes , various facsimiles , and an index of proper names .

		Some of the documents refer to the private life of
Cervantes	PERSON	and his family , in particular his daughter , and others to the writings of the immortal author , from '
Don Quixote	PERSON	' to ' Persiles and
Sigis	PERSON	- munda . '

		All of them throw fresh light upon the biog - raphy of
Cervantes	PERSON	and the bibliography of his writings , and although the critics may perhaps find matter for dispute in the significance and interpretation of some of the documents , there can be no doubt , generally speak - ing , of their historical value ... Quite as important as the volume of SeHor Pastor is that of
Don Ramdn Mene	PERSON	* ndez Pidal , ' La Leyenda de los Infantes de
Lara	PERSON	. '

		The writer studies this famous legend in the chansons de geste , in the ancient chronicles , in histories and ballads , in the drama , in modern poetry , finally in the folk-lore of to-day , paying special attention to the philological and critical examination of ancient documents . ''

		Senor Cotarelo 's ''
D. Enrique de Villena	PERSON	: du Vida y Obras '' and Senor Yxart 's '' El Arte Escenico en Espana '' are two critical works of value .

		In fiction , the chief items chronicled are D.
Juan Valera	PERSON	's '' Genio y Figura , ''
Senor Galdos	PERSON	's ''
Misericordia	PERSON	, '' and
Senor Una	ORGANIZATION	- muno 's `` Paz en la Guerra , '' a story of the Carlist struggle in the north of
Spain	LOCATION	.

		THE STUDY OP MAN AND OF CIVILIZATION .

		* '' When the first edition of
Katzel	ORGANIZATION	's VolJcer -
Jcunde	PERSON	was published in 1885-8 , it at once took its position as a guide book to the study of Man and Civilization . ''

		So says Mr.
Tylor	PERSON	in his introduction to the translation of that work , which appears in English under the name '' The History of
Mankind	LOCATION	. ''

		This translation is made by Mr.
A. J. Butler	PERSON	, from the second German edition .

		The later edition differs somewhat in arrangement from the earlier , and is more con - densed , being in two volumes instead of three .

		Mr.
Tylor	PERSON	's commendation is none too high ; every student is under real obligation to Pro- fessor
Ratzel	PERSON	for his work . ''

		The History of
Mankind	LOCATION	'' is really a man - ual of general ethnography .

		It is a descrip - tion of peoples : a study not only of their phys - ical characters , but also and even more fully of their life and institutions .

		In many of his positions the author is a conservative .

		He emphasizes somewhat strongly the common humanity of all races , and minimizes racial dif - ferences .

		He appears to attribute much of phys - ical racial difference to difference in form of culture .

		He seems to consider all races capable of easily acquiring civilization if they are placed within reach of civilized life .

		In fact , he says : '' The introduction of the so-called lower races into the circle of the higher civilization , and the overthrow of the barriers which once were raised high against such introduction , is not only a brilliant feat of humanity but at the same time an event of the deepest scientific inter - est. .

		For the first time , millions of what was considered the lowest race the blacks have had all the ad vantages , all the rights and duties , of the highest civilization thrown open to them ; nothing prevents them from employing all the means of self - formation which and herein lies the anthropological interest of the process will neces - sarily be transformation .

		If we could say to-day with approximate certainty what will become in the course of generations of the 12,000,000 of negro slaves who have within the last thirty years been freed in
America	LOCATION	, and who will , in the enjoyment of freedom and the most modern acquisitions of culture , have multiplied to 100,000,000 , we could with certainty answer the ques - tion as to the effect of culture upon race distinctions . ''

		And before the ink is dry on the page ,
Hoff	PERSON	- man 's book appears , giving a searching analy - sis the first adequate study so far of the race traits and tendencies of the American negro .

		There are not to-day even 12,000,000 * THB HISTORY OF MANKIND .

		of them ; there never will be 100,000,000 .

		They are not being hopefully affected by our civilization , and it looks as if their last state might be worse than their first .

		As for the distant future what is their outlook ?

		Is it not extinction ?

		And why ?

		Because they are negroes , and race traits are terribly strong .

		Ratzel 's position is always one of happy optim - ism , curiously blind to the reality and pro- fundity of race unlikeness .

		Of course all men are human ; of course human brains everywhere and always are capable of great achievement .

		We believe that the apparently simple inven - tions of early man were as great victories of the intellect as are our complex inventions of to-day .

		But to give a white man 's civilization to the negro , and to have him assimilate it , is no easy task .

		Many generations of time and constant action of many influences changing the whole man phy - sical , mental , moral are necessary .

		And dur - ing the experiment the lower race is like to die .

		Ratzel 's work as it now appears is handsomely printed and illustrated .

		The illustrations are chiefly portraits of peoples made from direct photographs and pictures of museum speci - mens ; while not always exactly fitting the text , they are interesting and instructive .

		There are nine colored plates , which show groups of na - tives , habitations , or carefully arranged masses of their art products .

		The work is divided into '' books , '' of which the first and part of the second are contained in the first volume .

		Book I. in 144 pages , presents the '' Principles of Ethnography . ''

		In thirteen chapters it sketches the field and makes a comparative study of human achievements and institutions .

		How civilization rises and spreads , and some of the elements of culture , are discussed .

		This book issued separately would make a good text in ethnography for class use .

		It shows , as no other book in our language , the value of ethno - graphic specimens and the mode of using them in study .

		The author believes in migration of arts and borrowing between tribes .

		Two sets of opinions are urged at present in this matter .

		The one claims that the finding of a given art or object , just the same among widely separated peoples , proves contact and mutual influence between these in the past , or community of descent .

		The other asserts that mankind is psychically a unit , and that everywhere , given a certain need or certain conditions , men widely sundered will independently invent the same things and think the same thoughts .

		As a con - crete illustration , some authors find the begin - nings at least of native American art in some

		THE DIAL other district , and look upon it as an importa - tion ; others find nothing here that suggests a foreign origin , and assert that North American art has grown up here from the beginning .

		Our author is one of the former class .

		He believes that the geographical distribution of an art , of a decorative style , of a peculiar belief or custom , is often a means of tracing relation - ships and contact between peoples and of fol - lowing lines of migration .

		Just at the present in our country the contrary view is carried to an astonishing extreme ; the principle is a good one , but may be easily carried too far .

		Ratzel 's book is then particularly important here at this time .

		While a whole culture may not be readily assimilated by a race far below those to whom it belongs , elements of arts and industries may easily be borrowed and are sure to be carried to new homes by tribes in migration .

		The second part of this volume is devoted to the
American Pacific Group of Races	ORGANIZATION	.

		Three clusters of peoples are studied the races of
Oceania	LOCATION	, the Australians , the Malays and Malagasies .

		In the study of these , the same course practically is pursued for each .

		The physical geography of the area occupied is ex - amined , the flora and fauna are described in their human relationships , and the races them - selves characterized .

		Then follow descriptions of the houses , dress , weapons , and other belong - ings , the mode of life , the social structure , the government , the religion .

		The mass of ma - terial presented is enormous , and it is extremely condensed .

		It is not easy reading , but is care - fully put and of great importance .

		The work deserves a great success in
America	LOCATION	, both among special students and more general readers .

		AMERICAN LITERATURE .

		* Two books about American literature , quite different but each very good in its way , are
evi	ORGANIZATION	- dence that
America	LOCATION	has produced a literature that is more than an echo of English literature , since it is filled with American scenery , Amer - ican thought , American character , and that this literature is well worthy of consideration .

		who does not love to listen ?

		Indeed , no one with less gifts as a raconteur could hope to take a period seemingly so barren for letters as that which began with the arrival of the `` May - flower '' and ended with
Irving	PERSON	's `` Rip Van Winkle , '' and make a book of four hundred pages without a dull line in it .

		What he says of
Benjamin Franklin	PERSON	and his '' Poor Richard '' sayings may with truth be applied to himself : '' Whoever can put new force and new beauty into an old truth by his method of re-stating it , is doing good work doing indeed what most of the good sermonizers are bent upon .

		No matter what old metal you may use , if you can put enough of your own powder behind it ' t will reach the mark . ''

		Only those authors whose birth-date falls before the beginning of the present century are included in this survey , the three names of principal importance being
Cooper	PERSON	,
Irving	LOCATION	, and
Bryant	PERSON	.

		Of all these , Mr.
Mitchell	PERSON	can speak from personal friendship , or at least acquain - tance , and the touches of personal reminiscence are very happy .

		It makes us realize how near our past really is when we read our author 's personal recollections of the memorial meeting at the death of
James Fenimore Cooper	PERSON	, a meet - ing which was called to order by
Washington Irving	LOCATION	and presided over by
Daniel Webster	PERSON	, and where eulogistic speeches were made by
Bancroft	LOCATION	and
Bryant	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Mitchell	PERSON	's characterization of
Cooper	ORGANIZATION	's powers and limitations may be cited as an ex - ample of the happy art with which he can put a bit of sound criticism in a taking form . ''

		There are writers to whom the details are every - thing ; and to whom elaborate finish , happy turns of expression , illustrative streaks of humor , give largest value and most consequence .

		With
Cooper	PERSON	' t is far otherwise ; there 's little finish , there 's no humor ; no ingenious turn of a sentence or a thought brings yon to pause either to weigh it or enjoy it .

		He is making his way to some dramatic end by bold , broad dashes of descriptive color , which he may multiply or vary with tedious divergencies , without spoiling his main chance .

		Hence there is no American author , scarce any popular author , who loses so little by translation .

		The charm that lies in light , graceful play of language about trifles is unknown to him . ''

		As the guest of
Washington	LOCATION	Irving at Sunny - side , Mr.
Mitchell	PERSON	has visited Sleepy Hollow , the creator of '' Rip '' and ''
Ichabod Crane	PERSON	'' pointing out the exact route of the memorable night-ride of a certain headless horseman , and dwelling with roguish delight on his own boyish escapades in the region afterwards made famous by his pen .

		Irving was doubtless the best loved by his contemporaries of any of this early group .

		He was not one of those strenuous souls who delve new channels for thought ; but his charac -
88	DATE	THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, ter was so clean , his language so full of grace , his sympathies so true and noble , his humor so genu - ine and abiding , that his books beam with a kind - liness that should not and will not be forgotten .

		The illustrations in Mr.
Mitchell	PERSON	's book are of great value , including pictures taken from rare portraits or engravings , facsimiles of old manuscripts or fragments of scarce books , maps , and a chronological chart showing the sequence of events having relation to development of American lands and letters .

		Like the three volumes of `` English Lands , Letters , and Kings '' previously published , this book and its probable successor bringing the story into the present time , may be commended especially for young persons as a stimulus to further study .

		Professor Painter 's '' Introduction to Amer - ican Literature '' begins with
John Smith	PERSON	and includes the present day .

		The classification is into five periods : First Colonial ,
Second Colo	ORGANIZATION	- nial , Revolutionary ,
First National	ORGANIZATION	, and
Second National	ORGANIZATION	.

		Quite properly , the '' First National '' period occupies the principal space , including as it does all of our greatest names
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Hawthorne	LOCATION	,
Longfellow	LOCATION	,
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	,
Whittier	LOCATION	,
Holmes	PERSON	.

		It would be difficult to better , in an equal number of pages , the characterizations of these men , and their respective parts in the life of the times are well differentiated .

		The Tran - scendental movement , the founding of the `` Atlantic Monthly , '' the formation of the
Saturday Club	ORGANIZATION	, the publication of '' The Dial , '' the Brook Farm experiment , are all given a place , but no more than their due place , as fac - tors in the evolution of American thought and letters .

		The book , though primarily designed for the use of schools , has a critical value and a largeness of treatment entitling it to a wider audience .


ANNA B. McMAHAN	PERSON	.

		THE FIRST ANNOTATION OF CARLYI/E 'S MOST CHARACTERISTIC WORK .

		* In the sixty-three years that have passed since
Carlyle	PERSON	's most characteristic book was reluctantly admitted in instalments to the pages of '' Eraser 's Magazine , '' this '' prose poem '' has steadily grown in importance , until now it marks , perhaps better than any other single work , the transition in English thought from the sense-philosophy of
Locke	LOCATION	to the faith in spiritual realities that followed in due time .

		At last a worthy annotated edition of ''

		Edited by
Archibald MacMechan	PERSON	, Professor in
Dalhoosie College	ORGANIZATION	.

Boston	LOCATION	:
Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Resartus '' has appeared , and Professor Mac - Mechan , the editor , is to be congratulated upon the industry , sympathy , and erudition with which his task has been accomplished .

		Of the four sources of the original work , copious ex - tracts from
Carlyle	LOCATION	's journal are here given in the notes , revealing a surprising fidelity of transcription in the process by which the au - thor thus turned the product of his private meditation to account .

		The use made , too , of his unfinished novel , ''
Wotton Reinfred	PERSON	, '' is striking in its ready adaptation , sometimes with very slight changes , to the new purpose in hand .

		As to the parallelism discovered between ''
Sar	ORGANIZATION	- tor '' and on the one hand the earlier essays , as well as on the other the translations from the German , there is doubtless room for some further work to be done , although the editor has also tilled this field faithfully .

		The inter - esting query , '' Who was Blumine ? ''

		is an - swered with a triple reference to
Margaret Gordon	PERSON	,
Catherine Fitzpatrick	PERSON	, and
Jane Welsh	PERSON	, with convincing data in each case , leav - ing the reader in agreement with the editor that the '' flower goddess '' is a composite portrait .

		But why should not the same liberal view prevail touching
Carlyle	PERSON	's style ?

		In general , the editorial analysis at this point is distinctly a service ; yet there is an apparent jealousy for the author 's originality that will not suffer ad - mission of any palpable degree of indebtedness to the Germans , and in particular to Richter .

		It is declared that
Carlylese	PERSON	is the product of early years at home , showing itself in letters antedating German influence .

		There is not space for an extended argument upon this dis - puted question , but a few facts may be stated and left to show their own bearing .

		Professor MacMechan regards the use of Germanisms as artfully designed to give the book an atmos - phere .

		But the earlier essays also are dotted with capitalized nouns , and show a gradual approach from an ordinary style to that with which later readers are familiar .

		Also , when the translation of ''
Wilhelm Meister	PERSON	'' ap - peared , it was blamed for its too frequent Ger - manisms , a fault that received censure again on the appearance of the specimens of German Ro - mance .

		Moreover , there is at least an attempt in '' Sartor '' to write in two different styles , that of the professor and that of the editor .

		That of the former , by a singular coincidence , is characterized by
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	in almost the same language as he had formerly employed in de - scribing the eccentricity of
Richter	ORGANIZATION	's literary manner .

		Which of the two styles is
Carlyle	LOCATION	's
1897	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 89 own ?

		Both are his , in so far as he is unsuc - cessful in differentiating the two .

		He confesses such failure by repeatedly using the device of apology , because the editorial style has been contaminated by contact with the professional metaphor and crabbedness .

		Is not the truth , in this instance as in the case of
Blumine	LOCATION	, that
Carlylese	PERSON	is a composite product , the result of a tendency plus an influence ?

		The Notes contain many grateful rays of light , from a variety of sources .

		It is here , if anywhere , that the results of collaboration are manifest .

		Many recondite allusions are satis - factorily traced to the fountain-head , while many other quotations are given that are chiefly illustrative of the similar products that the time-spirit may evoke from different men .

		About a dozen hard nuts are left uncracked , to tempt the teeth of future editors .

		The indebt - edness of
Carlyle	LOCATION	to the
Bible	LOCATION	and to Shake - speare appears , to the degree of the assimilation of these two books into the very flesh and bone of his diction .

		The long passage , afterward suppressed , from the first edition of '' Pelham , '' shows on how firm a basis of fact rests the pro- fessorial satire against the luckless dandiacal body .

		But was there any need , one asks , for striving to identify the alleged defect in the Latinity of the famous Swiftian epitaph , a de - fect alleged as excuse for not carving these muddy sentences upon the Zahdarm tombstone ?

		The only serious omission from the body of editorial contribution is an apt discussion of the place held historically by '' Sartor '' in the devel - opment of English thought .

		There are hints of such relations , here and there ; but it would seem that a work of so great significance should be accompanied by some formal account of the larger causes and conditions out of which it grew .

		The fact still remains that the first anno - tated edition of
Carlyle	LOCATION	's most original work is a valuable aid to the study of nineteenth-century literature .

		MURRAY 'S HISTORY OF GREEK LITERATURE .

		* A history of Greek literature , well written , concise yet full enough to give the reader an appreciative sense of its spirit and form , would be a real boon .

		Of this not too high ideal , the volume before us falls short .

		The book might more properly be called a critique than a his - * A HISTORY OF ANCIENT GREEK LITERATURE .

University of Glasgow	ORGANIZATION	.


New York	LOCATION	:

		tory of Greek literature .

		The writer has mani - festly a close and large acquaintance with his subject , and a just appreciation of many ele - ments of Greek life and thought .

		But some - how he fails to give that account of the litera - ture of the ancient Hellenes , and that insight into the forces and ideas that made it what it was and still is , that we have a right to expect from an historian .

		After reading the first chapter , which treats of Homer , one must still ask what are the char - acteristic features of the Greek epic , and what is Homer as literature ?

		A good deal that is instructive is said about the Homeric Question , but one not familiar with the discussion would hardly get a distinct idea of the chief theories and points at issue .

		With Professor
Murray	PERSON	's characterization of
Pindar	ORGANIZATION	, the admirers of the '' Theban Eagle '' are likely to find fault , and the opinion of the rest is not worth considering .

		The chapter on
Herodotus	ORGANIZATION	, while giving a just estimate of the scope and credibility of the his - tory , fails to do justice to the style and diction of this delightful story-teller .

		In the chapter on ^ Eschylus , the author speaks of Thespis ' own deme
Icaria	LOCATION	as being near to Eleusis , evidently in ignorance of the brilliant discovery of the true location of this deme by the late Professor
Merriam	PERSON	.

		It is rather a novel view to hold that JEschylus is in religious thought generally the precursor of Euripides .

		The chapters on Sophocles and Euripides are perhaps the most satisfactory of the book , though both writers are not closely enough related to the trend and tendencies of their own times .

		In spite of the caveat in the Preface , Aris - totle 's rank and influence as a writer entitle him to more space than is allowed .

		There is plenty of fine writing in the book ; occasionally , indeed , there is an attempt at '' smartness . ''

		No one will find it dull reading .

		But , as was said at the outset , the layman still needs a clear , objective , reasonably complete outline of the history of Greek literature within the compass of a single octavo volume .

Aug. 16	DATE	, MONOGRAPHS IN AMERICAN HISTORY .

		* The facility and economy of modern printing have made possible the preservation of all worthy results of investigation in every field of human ac - tivity .

		Formerly , the fruit of perhaps years of study and patient inquiry was embodied in a `` thesis , '' which , after presentation and as careful reading as the penmanship would allow , was carefully filed away in some dusty drawer as a counterweight in the balance against the diploma which was issued upon its authority .

		At the present day , the '' thesis '' is presented ready for the printer , and , indeed , fre - quently comes to the examiner in the desirable form of print .

		Thus issued , it is ready for exchange and for general distribution , carrying its information or message to the bounds of the reading world .

		Nor , indeed , is such publication confined to the student body .

		The modern teacher feels the pressure from a class larger than the one within his classroom ; he responds to the demand for the utilization of his time , aside from teaching , in investigation and sum - ming of results .

		In addition to these classes of contributors , professional men who find the ardor of student days returning to them give the benefits of their trained powers of examination to some subject , often in close touch with the teacher , and finally entrusting to the medium of the university the pub - lication of the results .

		In this way has grown up the present extensive system of monograph publication through regularly established channels .

		No university can now afford to be without its '' Studies '' or '' Annals . ''

		So rapidly these accumulate and so far they extend that one may picture the future investigator buried , like the maiden of old , beneath a mass of treasure , or imagine him lamenting the preemption of the last bit of un - occupied ground .

		Many of these efforts show the cramped hand of the student ; many of the conclu - sions reached exhibit the callowness of youthful minds ; the larger number of them would be much improved by being allowed to ripen in the sun of a few post-doctorate years .

		ture judgment , and as frequently clearing the ground for subsequent work , they are worthy of a promi - nent place in the literature of their respective sub - jects .

		The field of
American History	ORGANIZATION	, with the adjacent grounds of
Political Science	ORGANIZATION	, has been occupied with publications which compare favorably with other subjects both in number and quality .

		The materials are to be found on every hand , the sub - ject is inviting , and in probably no people of the world will the history of its growth and develop - ment be so fully described as in our own .


Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	, under the skilled direction of Professor
Albert Bushnell Hart	PERSON	, began several years since a series of studies in History and
Polit	PERSON	- ical Science which were described at the time in THE DIAL .

		He has recently revived the plan under the certainty of the
Henry Warren Torrey	ORGANIZATION	fund .

		The four numbers issued , bearing the title '' Har - vard Historical Studies , '' are the largest and most scholarly set of monographs given out by any insti - tution .

		The first is from the pen of a negro , Mr.
William E. Burghardt DuBois	PERSON	, of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, now conducting a special investigation into the con - dition of the negro people of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, under the direction of the
University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	.

		He presents a history of the '' Suppression of the African Slave Trade to the
United States of America	LOCATION	,
1638	DATE	-
1870	DATE	, '' with copious references , an exhaustive chron - ological conspectus of slave-trade legislation , and a very full bibliography .

		The second volume of the series , '' The Contest over the Ratification of the
Federal Constitution	ORGANIZATION	in the State of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, '' by Professor
Samuel B. Harding	PERSON	of the
Indiana University	ORGANIZATION	, is in line with the many recent investigations into the birth - years of American political parties .

		The frequently discussed attitude of
Hancock	PERSON	toward the Constitu - tion is here shown to be that of a politician who lends his influence for the sake of being supported as a possible candidate for the presidency or the vice-presidency .


Samuel Adams	PERSON	is described as also wishing to make some political popularity out of the struggle .

		Such revelations , together with the de - scription of the haste of these patriots to be favor - able to the new instrument when the
Boston	LOCATION	mechanics had declared for it , must prove an icono - clastic shock to the old style eulogistic conception of our political fathers and bring nearer the day when we shall study our men of affairs as they were .

		The third volume , '' A Study of Nullification in
South Carolina	LOCATION	, '' by Professor
David F. Houston	PERSON	of
the University of Texas	ORGANIZATION	, is devoted largely to refut - ing the statement in
Draper	PERSON	's '' Civil War '' that
Calhoun	PERSON	fostered and led the Nullification movement of 1828-32 .

		The economic and political changes occurring soon after
1820	DATE	, and the consciousness of the coming danger to slavery , produced a revulsion and a discontent in the people which
Calhoun	PERSON	simply followed .

		The author finds no direct , and but two indirect , results of the Nullification agitation : a deepened conviction of the conflict of interest be -
1897	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL tween the North and the South , and a hastening to the belief that secession was the only remedy left for the state against the Federal government .

		The investigation has been broad , the results are clearly stated , but the collocation is rather desultory .

		The fourth volume of the series , on '' Nominations for
Elective Office	ORGANIZATION	in the
United States	LOCATION	, '' departs from the purely historical ground which the preced - ing numbers assume .

		It comes from the hand of a scholar who has had later training in the practical aspect of the subject under consideration .

		Mr.
Dai	PERSON	- linger has served as a member of the
Massachusetts Senate	ORGANIZATION	, and his opinion upon the growth of nomina - ting machinery in the
United States	LOCATION	, its present status , its defects , and especially upon the remedies to be applied to existing evils , will be worthy of a hearing even from those who complain that the ordi - nary '' studies '' of the seminar are remote from the bounds of practicability . ''

		Three reforms '' says Mr.
Dallinger	PERSON	, `` are urgently needed : a diminution in the number of elective offices ; the absolute sep - aration of national and
State	ORGANIZATION	politics from local affairs ; and above all , the radication of the spoils system in the public service , and the consequent de - struction of the class of professional politicians . ''

		In connection with the sketch of the growth of the nom - inating system , Mr.
Dallinger	PERSON	gives a number of re - productions of ballots , blanks , etc. , which are most interesting and commonly inaccessible .

		A recent number of the ''
Columbia University Studies in History	ORGANIZATION	, Economics , and Public Law '' deals with '' The Struggle between President
John	PERSON	- son and
Congress	ORGANIZATION	over Reconstruction . ''

		In follow - ing the well-known lines of `` The
Congressional Globe	ORGANIZATION	, '' this monograph furnishes a fresh illustra - tion of the difficulty in making a broad estimate of an event so recent as Reconstruction .

		When occur - rences fresh from the mould of time shall be allowed to cool , and additional evidence be brought from reserved papers and material added from private resources , a clearer crystallization of facts may re - sult .

		The author finds it `` a fortunate thing for the country that the attempt -LSB- to convict
Johnson	PERSON	-RSB- failed . ''

		Lincoln had been sustained in his assumption of powers ; but , with
Johnson	PERSON	in the chair ,
Congress	ORGANIZATION	determined to resume its powers .

		In the violence of the reaction with which the country responded , the pendulum went too far and `` our institutions were in greater danger than they were before .

		But just as the Civil War had settled the question as to the indissolubility of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, so no less em - phatically did the failure of the impeachment trial confirm the equality of the three departments of our government . ''

		The tobacco industry of
Virginia	LOCATION	was so intimately connected with the slavery question before
1860	DATE	that it was an object of frequent and comprehensive study .

		Its later development and present conditions form the subject of a monograph by Professor
B. W. Arnold , Jr.	PERSON	, published in the series of ''
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	Studies . ''

		Although the tobacco industry declined immediately after the close of the Civil War , owing to the necessary diversion of labor to food-producing crops , the loss of slave labor , the rise of competing manufactures and the growth of urban population , yet in
1894	DATE	the state added over two and a
half millions of dollars	MONEY	to the internal revenue , and '' the finest residences , hotels , chambers of com - merce , educational institutions and public buildings have , for the most part , been built by profits from tobacco . ''

		The conclusion reached in the paper is that only fine tobacco will repay the cultivator , that the farmer must be educated to more skilful pro- duction , and that the evils of unrestricted competi - tion seem quite as pernicious as those of trusts .

		Rather remote from the intensive studies of the universities is a set of monographs most daintily gotten up by the
Preston & Rounds Co.	ORGANIZATION	, of Provi - dence , R. I .

		This
Rhode Island	LOCATION	series treats of the early colonial history of that state , the last number being the life of the pious
Samuell Gorton	PERSON	, the first settler of
Warwick	PERSON	, who rejoiced in bestowing upon his daughter the remarkable Scriptural name of
Mahershallalhashbaz	LOCATION	, and contested all his life for the privilege of independent thought .

		The story is made up of tags , reminiscent and reflective , and only the fact that they come from a genial mind and a warm heart , and that somehow they produce in their scrappy way the impression of superabundant life , do they save the hook from inanity and encourage the reader to persevere to the end .

		The first chapters of the hook are much the best , and , taken by themselves as a picture of French schoolboy life half a century ago , they are a fitting pendant to the story of
Tom Brown	PERSON	at Rugby .

		The famous construction of '' triste lupus , '' for example , is at least equalled by the achievement of the youth who makes '' J'estime les Danois et leurs dents de fer '' out of '' Timeo Danaos . ''

		We are sorry when
Barty	PERSON	leaves school , for he becomes far less interesting , and the people with whom he associates bore us not a little .

		Of course the book is attractive in spots throughout , made bright by sparkling bubbles of humor and serious by touches of poignant pathos , but in spite of these things it drags undeniably especially from the time when Martia begins to get in her uncanny work just as '' Trilby '' drags after the ill-advised introduction of the hypnotic motive . ''

		The Mar - tian '' will doubtless have many readers , just as '' Trilby '' had them , but we can not predict for it any measure of enduring fame , however brilliantly the author 's talent flashes out here and there .

		When a writer starts out to cultivate a Mere - dithian style he should at least be equipped with an elementary knowledge of English syntax .

		Mr.
J. C. Snaith	PERSON	, to whom this observation refers , mars what would otherwise be a good piece of work by the grossest of solecisms .

		He repeatedly uses '' like '' as a conjunction , and is so enamored of split infini - tives that he seems to go out of his way to make them .

		As for the Meredithian quality of his style , an extract may serve as illustration . ''

		Softly , softly !

		she twisted the knob within her cunning palm , she made no sound , she let no faint creak arise , but there it was unlatched with a secrecy excelling feline .

		Now she jammed one taut finger-tip against the panel 's face , applied the most expert nicety of pressure , and the door opened one-eighth of an inch , nor made no sound .

		A thread of lamplight curled out and made love to her sparkling face .

		It ad - mired her nostrils most , it saw the throb of battle in them .

		Success was now piping to her blood ; it swelled on the martial song and incited her eyes to flash rebellion . ''

		Not a bad imitation , surely , and '' Fierceheart the Soldier '' is written throughout in this sort of English .

		It purports to be a romance of the Forty-five , and it really is concerned in a way with the events from Prestoupans to
Culloden	LOCATION	.

		But its chief interest is domestic , and lies in its extremely strong and subtle characterization of some half - dozen persons .

		Fierceheart himself is a character not unlike the Nelson of history and the
Volodyovski	PERSON	of fiction , a brave soldier and an exceeding fop , equally concerned with love of country and the curl - ing of his wig , and inexorable when some point of honor is in question .

		And he is only one of the several strong and vital figures by which this book is made something distinctly out of the common .

		In Dr.
Doyle	PERSON	's recent novels we look in vain for the qualities that won for ``
Micah Clarke	PERSON	'' and '' The White Company '' such deserved admiration .

		In ''
Uncle Bernac	PERSON	, '' the latest of these productions , there is a fair degree of interest and a certain vigor of handling , but one would never think of reading the book a second time .

		The story is of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	at
Boulogne	LOCATION	, about to set out for the conquest of
England	LOCATION	, and is concerned chiefly with the adven - tures of the son of a French refugee royalist , who returns to
France	LOCATION	to offer his sword to the Emperor .

		The figure of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	is sketched in a theatrical , '' Madame Bejane '' sort of fashion , and one gets from it no impression of vitality .

		It portrays a few of the man 's humors , but not the man himself .

		The whole narrative , in fact , is sketchy , written currents calamo , and hurried to a tame conclusion . ''

		Middle Greyness '' is a novel whose scenes are laid alternately in
Australia	LOCATION	and in
England	LOCATION	.

		It tells of a man who has make a wreck of his own life -LRB- although we are not told just how -RRB- , and who relinquishes his two sons to a wealthy relative , who agrees to provide for them on condition that the father shall disappear completely .

		So the father takes to the
Bush	PERSON	and the sons are sent to the Uni - versity .

		How the father , despite his agreement , does come into the lives of his sons , unknown to them , and how the latter go their several ways the one to degradation and the other to fame is set forth with much prolixity .

		The father , con - scious of '' the black streak '' in his own character , hopes to find it subdued to '' middle greyness '' in the characters of his sons .

		This is the explanation of the title , and it must be said that the author harps upon these and some other favorite phrases with undue persistence .

		The book is not very well writ - ten , and its best passages are those which relate to
Australia	LOCATION	.

		Here we have pages of description which fairly glow with color , and which are filled with what may be called the passion of the
Bush	PERSON	.

		On the whole , the book is not a strong one , although it has flashes of genuine power .

		Similar characteristics must be ascribed to the collection of a dozen sketches that the author of '' Middle Greyness '' has brought into a volume entitled '' Mere Sentiment . ''

		Some of these , also , are Australian in theme , and all of them lie rather without the usual rut of the teller of stories .

		They are not very carefully worked out , and are brought to somewhat abrupt conclusions .

		Mr.
A. E. W. Mason	PERSON	's thrilling story of '' The Courtship of
Morrice Buckler	PERSON	'' gave us a taste for its author which is hardly satisfied by his new book , '' The Philanderers . ''

		He is better at intrigue and adventure than in the analysis of character which he attempts in the present work , and the reader feels

		THE DIAL 93 but a languid interest in his
London	LOCATION	society figures the fickle maiden who adds conquest to conquest , the vain and petty litterateur , and even the late leader of an African expedition , now turned pro- moter and busied with the floating of a new enter - prise .

		We should have liked him better had he remained in
Africa	LOCATION	where the beginning of the story finds him .

		`` Mr.
Peters	PERSON	'' is a novel that begins with a lynching-bee in
Western America	LOCATION	, and ends by drop - ping the hero into the sea at
Leith	LOCATION	.

		This hero is a gentleman of Swiss-Italian extraction , the son of the innocent victim of the lynchers , and a child at the time of the fatal occurrence .

		When he grows up , his one object in life is to track the two men who were chiefly responsible for the tragedy , and to avenge upon them his father 's death .

		The scene is mostly laid in
Edinburgh	LOCATION	, to which the two men find their way , and the tedium of the motive above out - lined is relieved by the introduction of a number of minor characters none of whom turn out very inter - esting .

		The book has some touches of grim humor and a few fairly animated scenes , but it undoubt - edly drags in many places , and the general effect is one of incoherency .

		Nearly every one of the char - acters is blurred in the delineation , and we search in vain for some clean-cut and vividly-conceived figure with an unmistakable personality of its own .

		On the whole , one is glad when the victims of Mr.
Peters	PERSON	are out of the way and he himself is drowned , for he might have gone on fumbling indefinitely with his ineffectual plans for revenge .

		Mr.
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	's work is always carefully conceived and elaborated with much artistic finish .

		He has recently added two books to his lengthening list .

		One of them , '' The Pomp of the Lavilettes , '' is the story of a French Canadian village at the time of
Papineau	ORGANIZATION	's abortive rebellion -LRB- 1837-8 -RRB- .

		It is a strong piece of work , dramatic and stirring , per - haps not quite as good as '' Valmoml , '' but holding the attention absorbed in the fortunes of its leading characters , and brought to a finely tragic ending .

		`` A Romany of the Snows , '' Mr.
Parker	PERSON	's other new book , is a volume of nine short stories , in many of which our old friend Pierre figures .

		It has the crisp atmosphere of the Northern wilderness , the mystery and the romance of life among a simple people who live close to nature , and are none the worse for being without the trappings of a sophis - ticated civilization .

		Some months ago our readers were informed of the fund of entertainment awaiting them in Mr.
Louis Tracy	PERSON	's '' The Final War . ''

		No less auda - cious in conception , and fully as beguiling for an idle day , is Mr.
Tracy	PERSON	's new romance of '' An Amer - ican Emperor . ''

		Just why the book should be fur - ther styled `` A Story of the Fourth Empire of
France	LOCATION	'' is not altogether clear , and we fear that the author has got the two historical empires mixed up with the three republics .

		Be that as it may , this story of an American multimillionaire , who makes himself Emperor of
France	LOCATION	, without shedding any blood in the attempt , is what unconventional youth would call '' a rattling good book , '' and what sober reflection is bound to admit to be animated and exciting in a very marked degree .

		It is a sort of compound of the daring of
Dumas	LOCATION	, Sue , and
Jules Verne	PERSON	, with no style to speak of , and with nothing that could be called delineation of character , but with inventive and narrative qualities that do some - thing to make up for the lack of more serious ones . ''

		A Princess and a Woman '' is a romance of the `` Zenda '' type , and tells how a dashing young American officer won the heart and the hand of a princess , in spite of the determination of the Rus - sian court to force her marriage with the ill-favored Prince of
Carpathia	LOCATION	.

		It is a fairly clever and well - managed book , written by Mr.
Robert McDonald	PERSON	, and published as the first of a new copyright series of cloth-bound volumes to be sold at the very low price of
twenty-five cents	MONEY	each .

		The projector of this commendable enterprise is Mr.
Frank Munsey	PERSON	, the proprietor of a well-known monthly magazine .

		When one of Mr.
Stockton	PERSON	's books has been de - scribed , the epithets needed for the rest of them are exhausted .

		`` A Story-Teller 's Pack , '' containing eleven tales , exhibits the whimsical humor with which we are so familiar , the ingenuity of invention , and the cheery outlook upon life .

		The stories are certainly amusing , particularly those called '' The Staying Power of Sir
Rohan	PERSON	, '' `` As One Woman to Another , '' and `` The Widow 's Cruise . ''

		prepared for publication Number Twelve of the Publications that bear the name of this organization .

		It is entitled ''
Bryant	PERSON	's Station and the
Memorial Proceedings	ORGANIZATION	held on its Site under the Auspices of the
Lexington	LOCATION	Chapter D.A.R.
August the 18th , 1896	DATE	, in Honor of its Heroic Mothers . ''

		The contents , which are contributed by different authors , are entitled `` The Lexington Chapter , D.A.R. , '' `` The First Act in the Siege of
Bryant	PERSON	's Station , '' `` The Women of the Station , '' an original poem , `` The Story of the Station , '' `` The Battle of the Blue Licks , '' and an '' Historical Sketch of the
Filson Club	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The `` dark and bloody ground , '' strange to say , was not inhabited by Indians at the time when the men from
Virginia	LOCATION	and the
Carolinas	LOCATION	began to enter in and take possession ; it was the bone of contention between the tribes lying to the south and the north , and the familiar name was given to it for this very reason ; still , the northern savages held the region in a firm grasp , and it was rescued from them only by bloody and desperate 94 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, contests like those of
Bryant	PERSON	's Station and the Blue Licks .

		It is difficult to make students of old-world history believe that these conflicts in the western wilderness rank in importance with the battles that brought the countries of central and northern
Europe	LOCATION	under the dominion of civilized man ; but time is showing that such is the fact .

		The
Kentucky	LOCATION	stories are the more important because they fre - quently show British officers from
Canada	LOCATION	leading the Indians on their forays .

		It was at
Bryant	ORGANIZATION	's Station , the reader will remember , that the women and girls , twenty-eight in number , when the garrison was on the point of perishing for water , issued from the gate , covered as it was by the rifles of the war - riors in hiding , proceeded to the
spring	DATE	, filled their pails and piggins , and returned in safety to their hus - bands , fathers , and brothers who were standing to their guns behind the stockade , the savages refrain - ing from firing upon them or seizing them because their white commander had ordered them to wait until guns were heard on the other side of the station .

		A
Kentucky	LOCATION	orator has compared the act to the deed of
David	PERSON	's three mighty men of war who broke through the ranks of the
Philistines	LOCATION	and brought water for their chieftain from the well at
Bethlehem	LOCATION	.

		The act was in fact a more daring one . ''

		The basin of the
spring	DATE	was not deep enough to plunge the vessels and thus fill them at once .

		They had to dip the water with gourds , and thus tediously and slowly fill their vessels .

		During this slow process , which lengthened moments into hours , a glance to the right or left might have met the glittering black eyes of bloodthirsty savages peeping from behind trees or from among the undergrowth which concealed them .

		... The girls were not probably fully aware of the danger incurred , but the women comprehended the situation fully , '' says one of the writers , '' and by an act of cool and deliberate courage won for them - selves a name which should never pass from the memorial page of our history . ''

		The present num - ber is one of the largest of the
Filson Club Publica	ORGANIZATION	- tions , and appears , in the same sumptuous style as its predecessors , from the press of Messrs.
John P. Morton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, of
Louisville	LOCATION	.

		An entertaining little book that comes with a certain timeliness , after recent events in the
East	LOCATION	, is Captain
John Codman	PERSON	's '' An
American Transport	ORGANIZATION	in the Crimean War '' -LRB-
Bonnell , Silver & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Mr.
John Codman Ropes	PERSON	, the author 's cousin , has supplied a brief commendatory introduction .

		The book forms at once a capital sailor 's yarn and an instructive foot - note to the history of the Crimean war .

		Captain Codman sailed for
Marseilles	LOCATION	,
May 20 , 1854	DATE	, in command of the ''
William Penn	PERSON	, '' a small steam freighter with accommodations for twenty odd passengers .

		The ''
Penn	LOCATION	'' was a pioneer vessel of her class , and her experimental venture proved a failure .

		After lying idle at
Marseilles	LOCATION	for a time , she was chartered by the French government for transport service , and sent to the
Crimea	LOCATION	with a A Yankee skipper in the Crimean war .

		cargo of stores and ammunition and a detach - ment of troops .

		The author 's account of this trip , and of the ''
Penn	LOCATION	's '' subsequent adventures as a transport plying between the scene of hostilities in the
Crimea	LOCATION	and the various bases of supplies , is decidedly readable .

		After the expiration of his contract with the French , he took service with the Turks , the runs being mostly between
Constanti	PERSON	- nople and
Varna	LOCATION	or Eupatoria .

		His experiences with the Turks were on the whole agreeable .

		In their service , he says , '' we had an exceedingly easy time .

		The French idea of putting off nothing for the morrow that could be done to-day was exactly reversed .

		... I honestly think there was a great deal of pay for very little work . ''

		Captain Cod - man 's account of Turkish officials and their ways is amusing and not unfavorable .

		His first encounter with the Turk , officially , was at
Nagara Point	ORGANIZATION	in the
Dardanelles	LOCATION	, where the ''
Penn	LOCATION	'' went aground '' on the very spot where Leander landed when he swam the Hellespont . ''

		The reigning official of the place ,
Suleyman Pasha	PERSON	, was most kind and attentive to the stranded `` Giaours , '' and it was mainly through his aid that the ''
Penn	LOCATION	'' was finally floated .

		When the question of remuneration was delicately broached to this good Samaritan , he seized Captain Codman 's hand , and placing it upon his heart , replied : '' God pays me , my brother . ''

		Could -LRB- or would -RRB- a Christian have said more ?


Suleyman Pasha	PERSON	was a strict -LRB- if literal -RRB- observer of the forms described by the Prophet .

		When he dined on board the ''
Penn	LOCATION	, '' Captain Codman , on the principle of not tempting one 's brother to offend , carefully excluded wine from the table . ''

		Think , then , '' he says , '' of my astonishment at a gentle hint from the
Pasha	LOCATION	as to champagne !

		It was of course immediately produced .

		Upon my remark - ing that it had not been offered before on account of what I supposed to be his religious scruples , he replied with an air of perfect sincerity , ' Wine was forbidden by the prophet ; not champagne .

		Cham - pagne did not exist in his day ; how then could he have forbidden it ?

		Marshallah !

		God is great , ' con - tinned
Suleyman	PERSON	, smoothing his beard and soothing his conscience . '

		Pass the bottle . ' ''

		Captain Cod - man 's little book is well worth reading .

Chapman	PERSON	's `` Marriage Ques - in literature ... / , _ .

		.

		, , tions in Modern fiction , and other Essays '' -LRB-
John Lane	PERSON	-RRB- is recent ; the others belong to different years in the past decade , although all have been carefully revised for publication .

		The book is therefore interesting , if only as giving some idea of the increase of a tendency which most of us have got so used to that we hardly appreciate it .

		Yet it certainly is remarkable that the chief novels of the last few years should so often deal in one way or another with what may be vaguely called '' mar - riage questions . ''

		And this larger sphere the sphere of ''
Tess	PERSON	of the d'Urbervilles , '' of '' Trilby , '' of ''

		THE DIAL 95 the nebula -LRB- so far as this matter is concerned -RRB- of the more intense core furnished by such books as '' The Story of an African Farm , '' '' The Heavenly Twins , '' '' The Woman who Did , '' '' Jude the Ob - scure . ''

		Books like these latter are more or less propogandist ; but even books like the former show the workings of the thought of our time .

		In view of all this , Mrs.
Chapman	PERSON	argues , simply enough , and sensibly , for indissoluble marriage and no divorce at all .

		The conclusion is a difficult one to avoid , if one accepts the idea of a life-union of one man and one woman as being the ideal to be ulti - mately attained .

		We need not , however , give Mrs.
Chapman	PERSON	's arguments nor our own commentary ; it is enough here to mention her rational tone and her success in avoiding the absurdity and tediousness one sometimes finds in discussions on the subject .

		Beside the title-essay , and four others on marriage and divorce , there are two on literary topics : one on '' The Disparagement of Women in Literature , '' and one on u St.
Paul	PERSON	and the Woman Movement , '' both interesting .

		The first amazes us -LRB- trained as we were to an opposite view by Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	in his monograph on '' Queen 's Gardens '' -RRB- by the devel - opment of the thesis that Shakespeare arrogantly , and in a domineering way , regarded women as inferior to men .

		The second essay shows that St.
Paul	PERSON	emphasized the inferior position of women , a matter of very slight importance , since there are few wives who , however sound on the question of verbal inspiration , regard the word '' obey '' as other than an empty conventionality .

		This matter of the inferiority of woman does not appear to us to be one to be settled by present argument .

		There can be little doubt that woman was the inferior sex , phys - ically and mentally .

		Without inquiry into the rea - son , such was the fact , and on that fact arose tradi - tion and convention .

		Now , we understand , the fact is otherwise , or at least ought to be .

		New traditions and new conventions will doubtless accommodate themselves to the new fact .

		Meanwhile , why not let
St. Paul	ORGANIZATION	and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	rest in peace ?

		lan -RRB- J 8 ft cont ribution to the Source , or laboratory , method of teaching history .

		Stated in its extreme form , this method puts the pupil , as soon as he is furnished with any , even the slender - est , thread of historical narrative , at the sources , or documents , and leaves him , with more or less help , to elaborate his own history from the materials .

		Stated in a more conservative manner , it introduces the student , when he has made a certain rather indef - inite degree of progress in the study of historical text-books , to original material , and leaves him , under competent direction , to check and work out results for himself , and , what is more important , to master the method of historical investigation .

		At the core , the two forms of statement do not disagree ; the only open question is , How soon the pupil shall be introduced to the source method ?

		The truth is , this question can not be answered in term ; sources will be so gradually introduced in good history teach - ing , and text-books so progressively laid aside , that there is no abrupt passage from the one method to the other .

		Carried to an extreme , the new method will do much harm ; used judiciously , it is capable of accomplishing great good .

		In fact , it is not so '' new '' as it seems to be ; to read the Declaration of Independence , the Constitution of the
United States	LOCATION	,
Washington	LOCATION	's Farewell Address , or
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's Inaugural Addresses , is to study history in its sources ; so that what is really new is the enhanced emphasis and the new methods of providing and handling material .

		Professor
Hart	PERSON	holds to the source method in its more conservative form , and has undertaken to prepare a series of volumes of sources to promote its use .

		Volume I. -LRB- `` Era of Colonization , 1492-1689 '' -RRB- , now before us , is the first of the series .

		The selections are well made , well arranged , and well printed ; and the volume , like those that are to follow , can not fail to receive a warm welcome from all teachers and students of American history .

		We have heard a very competent professor of American history express regret that the apparatus of annotation and criticism is not more abundant ; and the point seems to be well taken .

		Still , considerable assistance of this kind is afforded the reader .

		The book takes its place at once on the shelf as indispensable .

		Early critical The '' Quarterly Review '' was once work of much vexed at Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	Mr. GO *** .

		because , while
Clark	PERSON	Professor of Poetry at
the University of Cambridge	ORGANIZATION	, he prefaced his learned work '' From Shakespeare to Pope '' with a poem in which he represented himself as a spar - row sitting on a clothes-line in Mr.
W. D. Howells	PERSON	's back-yard .

		We think that this was a harmless fancy on the part of the amiable critic , and we regret that he has not prefaced the revised edition of his `` Seventeenth Century Studies '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- with a little poem representing himself as a lark , disdaining the earth in the roseate dawn and blithely singing of divine things while lost in the empyrean .

		Such a conception would , we think , attune the mind of the reader to the '' criticism '' in the book , which is called '' a contribution to the his - tory of English Poetry . ''

		Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	himself has elsewhere expressed his idea of the advantage to the writer of literary history of '' a rare combination of exact knowledge with the power of graceful com - position . ''

		The fact that he does not mention sound judgment as another useful possession will not sur - prise those familiar with his work .

		This book cer - tainly shows graceful composition : Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	has the gift , or art , of writing , in a way that interests one .

		But as for exact knowledge and sound judg - ment , these are things that no one need expect from him .

		This book has been before the public fourteen years , in part more .

		In that time it has been criti - cised for absurdities of judgment and statement , not so much as some of the works of Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	, 96 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, it is true , but still enough to be noticed .

		In the present edition , some additions have been made , but not a single correction ; nor is there any allu - sion to any criticism , except a letter from Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	in regard to one of his poems , concerning which Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	appeared to have a false idea .

		The book is the same charming composition which has attracted so many to various half-forgotten poets of the seven - teenth century that its sins of omission and com - mission are doubtless often forgiven it .

		A converted Thirty years of recreative study fill pagan of the the fat volume containing Archbishop third century .

		Benson 's `` Cyprian , his Life , his Time , his Work '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- .

		The author found peculiar fascination in the story of this converted pagan .

		As a sort of mental athletics , and retreat from the duties of his church , be has pursued for thirty years a very minute investigation of the lit - erature on this ancient church father , and his book represents monumental and scholarly and loving sympathetic industry .

		The period of history whose story is told here covers fifteen years -LRB- 246-260 B. C. -RRB- in the
third century	DATE	.

		The charming city of
Carthage	LOCATION	, the queen of
Northern Africa	LOCATION	, is the principal scene of the Cyprianic trials , triumphs , and tragedy .

		Cyprian 's heathen education , his con - version to Christianity , his promotion in the Church , his sacrifices , his sufferings , his theological beliefs , his persecutions , and his martyrdom , are all fol - lowed out with such nicety of detail and keenness of discrimination as to leave nothing further to be de - sired .

		The persecutions of Roman emperors , the Church councils , the dogmas of leaders , are analyzed and set forth with scholarly exactness .

		Though he was a close imitator and admirer of Tertullian , we are led to see that
Cyprian	ORGANIZATION	occupies a unique place in the African Church .

		It is refreshing to see that the author has utilized the best and latest literature on the subject ; the Index gives the titles of ninety - four works , in
Latin	LOCATION	, German , and French , quoted and referred to in the body of the book .

		Foot-notes abound , as they should , in confirmation of the views advanced by the author .

		Ten appendices deal with special themes touching the times of Cyprian .

		A few woodcuts and three elegant maps add to the attractiveness of the volume .

		Though not easy read - ing for other than Church historians and similar specialists , this sumptuous volume will not for long years cease to be the standard life of the great African churchman .

		Memories of
Hawthorne	LOCATION	.

		No American author has achieved a reputation more secure than that of
Hawthorne	LOCATION	.

		Hence , perhaps , it will be with many that of no American author would they more gladly see a volume of Memories .

		It is pretty certain , however , that the real interest in
Hawthorne	LOCATION	concerns itself more with his work than with his personal character , and it is very probable , too , that no matter how many volumes of reminis - cence might appear , we should never know much more of him than we might now .

		Hawthorne would seem to have been more or less like the man in '' Wakefield '' : he habitually lived in the next street from his family .

		Still , they sometimes saw him , and these little snatches make Mrs.
Rose Hawthorne Lathrop	PERSON	's '' Memories of Hawthorne '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- an exceedingly interesting book , as indeed every - one would imagine .

		It is , as Mrs.
Lathrop	PERSON	says , really written by her mother , being largely made up from
Sophia Hawthorne	PERSON	's letters .

		The interest in the book is partly domestic : it is the picture of Hawthorne playing blindman 's buff with the '' Old People '' -LRB- as he called his children -RRB- , or of
Hawthorne	PERSON	cultivating incomparable vegetables in the garden of the
Manse	ORGANIZATION	, or harvesting water-lilies on the Assahet ; and it is partly historical : as with the skating-party , for instance , of
Hawthorne	ORGANIZATION	wrapped in a cloak , skating like a Greek statue , Thoreau figuring dithy - rambic dances and Bacchic leaps , and
Emerson	PERSON	all tired out coming to rest by Mrs.
Hawthorne	PERSON	.

		Lit - erary the book is not , in the sense , that is , that we do not learn from it much of
Hawthorne	LOCATION	the man of letters .

		It is as well that we do not : Hawthorne the genius is to be found sufficiently in what he wrote .

		In this volume
Hawthorne	PERSON	the man , amid his surroundings , comes to view cordially and even intimately .

		He was a man rather different from what any reader of his books would imagine , and although in this book he is always in the background , yet even though he be not clearly presented , we get probably a truer idea of his personality than we could from a more definite presentation .

		Mr.
J. E. Farmer	PERSON	's `` Essays on French History '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- are two in number , and they make but a slender volume .

		The author has not burrowed very deeply into the sources of history , and his style is somewhat crude ; yet he has got together many details in the history of two important periods that even careful readers could find only with some dif - ficulty .

		The opening essay is on '' The Rise of the Reformation in
France	LOCATION	and its Relation to Martin Luther ; '' the other , which is a stronger piece of work , is a sketch of the history of '' The Club of the Jacobins . ''

		The description of the methods used in controlling the Assembly and directing the current of affairs by organized mob violence is of special interest .

		The history of British
India	LOCATION	, as told by
R. W. Frazer	PERSON	in his recent addi - tion to the '' Story of the Nations '' series -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , is a most interesting narrative and a good piece of popular history-writing .

		Beginning with the early history of Indian commerce , Mr.
Frazer	PERSON	traces the rise of English influence through the founding and growth of the
East India	LOCATION	Company ;
England	LOCATION	's bitter struggles with the Portuguese , Dutch , and French ; the gradual conquest of the vast country ; and the later history of the organiza - tion and strengthening of the government .

Hastings	PERSON	,
Havelock	PERSON	, and
Lawrence	PERSON	, are described briefly but with spirit .

		England 's policy in seizing the principalities and appropriating the wealth of the princes is not upheld from the strictly moral point of view , but the author significantly likens it to her present policy in
South Africa	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	's policy in the
Northern Pacific	LOCATION	which he regards as justi - fiable aggressions for the sake of trade and imperial influence .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		The fifth volume of
Henry Craik	PERSON	's '' Selections from English Prose '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- concludes an important work , which was reviewed at length in THE DIAL of
Sept. 1 , 1893	DATE	.

		The volume includes passages from forty-six different writers , beginning with
Scott	PERSON	and ending with
Stevenson	PERSON	.

		The original plan for four vol - umes only has been enlarged to include a fifth , owing to the riches of our prose literature , so that the number and variety of the examples chosen have been corre - spondingly increased .

		The selections have been well made , the introductions are by the same well-known critics and men of letters , and , owing to its nearness to ourselves , the last volume of the set surpasses in interest and value any that have preceded .

		The complete work is now published in a handsome library edition , in the same number of volumes .

		The Chautauqua books for the coming year , five in number as usual , have just been published by
Messrs. Flood & Vincent	ORGANIZATION	, and are as usual well-chosen and attractive . ''

		This work is also published by Messrs.

		Imperial
Germany	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Sidney Whitman	PERSON	, is a new edition of a work nearly ten years old .

		Last of all , we have a volume upon '' The Social Spirit in
America	LOCATION	, '' by Prof.
C. R. Henderson	PERSON	, whose name is very familiar to our readers , and whose work forms an admirable introduction to the subject of social science .

Congress	ORGANIZATION	, as those of Mr.
Spofford	PERSON	, Mr.
Solberg	PERSON	, and Mr.
Hutcheson	PERSON	, to leading and responsible positions in the library .

		While it must be a matter of regret that the selection of a chief for our national library was not made from among profes - sional library managers , rather than made on political grounds , yet it is to Mr.
Young	PERSON	's credit that he under - stands so well the kind of men needed for the successful working of the great institution under his charge .


Baron Pierre de Coubertin	PERSON	is a young French writer who is rapidly making his mark in serious literature .

		We received some time ago his valuable work on '' L'Evolution Franchise sous la Froisieme Re ` publique , '' which is now soon to appear in an English translation .

		Still more recently , his '' Souvenirs d'Ame ` rique et de Grece '' has been published , and we have found the sketches of travel which it contains interesting without being frothy .

		The author is a keen observer of men and manners , and his style has an agreeable animation .

		The
London	LOCATION	'' Review of Reviews '' announces that the seventh volume of the valuable and exhaustive '' Annual Index to Periodicals , '' covering the year
1896	DATE	, is now ready .

		The indexing and compilation of the volume is the work of Miss

		122 HERO-WORSHIP .

		Two or three years ago , Professor
John W. Burgess	PERSON	made some suggestive remarks , which we are about to quote , upon the ethics of hero - worship .

		Their immediate application was to the American anti- slavery agitation and the
John Brown	PERSON	cult , but they convey a lesson and a warning that should be taken to heart in con - nection with many other subjects , not only in the department of political history , but in all the fields of human endeavor . ''

		I consider , '' he said , '' that the highest responsibility resting upon an historian is the right selection of those personalities which he holds up for the worship of after generations .

		The morals of the age are determined most largely by the character of its heroes .

		No amount of precept , religious or ethical , will have one tithe of the influence in forming the ideals of our youth that hero - worship possesses .

		If there is , then , one mo - ment more solemn than another in the life of the historian , one when he should seek more earnestly than at another to be delivered from all prejudice , error , and weakness , it is when he essays the role of the hero-maker .

		If he fails in this , he may well question if all the other good he may have accomplished has not been over-balanced .

		There is a mawkish notion prevalent among the members of a certain very advanced class of people in almost all parts of the world , that if you add cant to crime you lessen the crime .

		Some of them think that the outcome of such a combination is the most heroic virtue .

		All of us judge crime more leniently when committed by persons who have views in common with us upon some important subject , and against persons whom we regard with feelings of hostility .

		But the moralist , the historian , and the inventor of epics are under bonds to civilization to rise above such weak - ness . ''

		The false kind of sentiment that is here con - demned in such impressive terms has done much mischief in perverting the ethical judg - ments passed by mankind upon the conspicuous figures of history .

		In ancient times , it deified Alexander the Great and
Julius Caesar	PERSON	, to say nothing of a long line of lesser conquerors and leaders of victorious hosts .

		In our own century , it has made of Napoleon a subject for eulogy rather than for execration , it has in a measure justified the career of the man of '' blood and iron '' who looms so large in the history of modern
Germany	LOCATION	, and it is now en - gaged in glossing over the unscrupulous methods of the ambitious adventurer who has come to regard
South Africa	LOCATION	as his own personal ap - panage .

		It would seem , indeed , when we con - sider these and the many similar cases which history presents to our view , that success , by whatever means achieved , is too often taken by the public as the adequate test of greatness , and that a man 's career passes for heroic if 106 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, only it be sufficiently brilliant to attract wide - spread attention , and sufficiently daring to impose upon the imagination of men .

		The ethical philosopher , of course , bases his judg - ment upon other criteria than these , for he knows that failure is often more heroic than success , and that many a mute inglorious ca - reer , with which only the few are acquainted , may offer a finer example for the emulation of mankind than is offered by the lives of those who shine in the fierce light that beats upon the seats of the mighty .

		Carlyle has done much to glorify the type of man who succeeds by sheer strength of will , and the gospel of brute force has collected a singular company in his gallery of heroic figures .

		Yet it is from
Carlyle	LOCATION	himself that we have chosen a passage which emphasizes , better than it has often been emphasized , the eternal distinction between the strength that should command our admiration and the strength that is perversely employed . ''

		A certain strong man , of former time , fought stoutly at
Lepanto	ORGANIZATION	; worked stoutly as Algerine slave ; stoutly de - livered himself from such working ; with stout cheerfulness endured famine and nakedness and the world 's ingratitude ; and , sitting in jail , with the one arm left him , wrote our joyfullest , and all but our deepest , modern book , and named it '
Don Quijote	PERSON	' : this was a genuine strong man .

		A strong man , of recent time , fights little for any good cause anywhere ; works weakly as an English lord ; weakly delivers himself from such working ; with weak despon - dency endures the cackling of plucked geese at
St. James	LOCATION	's ; and , sitting in sunny
Italy	LOCATION	, in his coach - and-f our , at a distance of two thousand miles from them , writes , over many reams of paper , the following sentence , with variations : ' Saw ever the world one greater or un happier ? '

		This was a sham strong man .

		Choose ye . ''

		While this comparison , in its straining for antithetical effects , is not altogether fair to
Byron	PERSON	, whose life was at least closed by a piece of genuine heroism , yet in the main it enforces a lesson that should be taken to heart .

		The Byronic cult was undoubtedly in its day respon - sible for a great deal of sickly sentimentalism , and its influence still lingers in English litera - ture .

		As contrasted with
Shelley	PERSON	's ardent and high-souled devotion to great causes and fine ideals , the passion of Byron at its best seems theatrical and insincere , and the gospel of '' Childe Harold '' is but a poor thing when viewed in the glowing light of the '' Prometheus Unbound . ''

		In literature , as in other departments of hu - man activity , there are sham heroes as well as genuine ones .

		This statement is not meant to imply that a writer whose private life will not bear the closest scrutiny is for that reason un - heroic as a literary figure , for the weakness of will by which personal conduct is so often mis - shapen may coexist with an intellectual life of the rarest distinction .

		And since the essential thing about a writer is his work , he has a right to be judged by that work , almost irrespective of the life that lies behind it .

		The figure of
Schopenhauer	PERSON	, for example , is one of the most heroic in literature , although the character of the man , as apart from the writer , left much to be desired .

		But the noble sincerity of his work , and its exaltation of fine ideals in both thought and conduct , are qualities so marked that we are quite justified in ignoring the un - lovely aspects of the personal biography .

		On the other hand , the most conspicuous of literary figures may fail to assume heroic proportions if the work for which it stands have any sug - gestion of pose or insincerity .

		We may be very indulgent to the infirmities of the flesh , pro- vided only they do not fetter or drag down the spirit .

		There is a false ring , which no sound - ing rhetoric can altogether deaden to the dis - .

		cerning ear , in the work of many masterful writers , and when that ring is once detected , the power of the voice to shape our intellectual ideals becomes sadly weakened .

		This false note may be caught over and over again in
Byron	LOCATION	; it makes the Whitman cult seem a strange phenomenon to minds entirely well - balanced and sane , and it lessens the effect - ive appeal of even such giants as Hugo and
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	.

		When we think of certain figures in litera - ture as peculiarly heroic , we do not usually stop for analysis , but are content to rest the judg - ment upon a mixture of impressions , in part derived from the life , and in part from the work .

		Scott and Balzac are good examples of this , for both are heroic figures in a very genuine sense , and we hardly know whether to admire them the more for their courageous struggle against ad - verse material conditions or for their resolute pursuit of a great creative purpose .

		Instead of taking these men for our illustration , let us take instead a man who was a hero of litera - ture pure and simple , a man whose career has for the literary worker the same sort of lessons that the career of Spinoza has for the philoso - pher , of
Gordon	PERSON	for the soldier , or of
Mazzini	PERSON	for the statesman .

		THE DIAL 107 bert , and our task is made easy by borrowing from the eloquent address made at
Oxford	LOCATION
last June	DATE	by
M. Paul Bourget	PERSON	. ''

		No man was ever more richly endowed with the higher virtues of a great literary artist , '' says
M. Bourget	PERSON	. ''

		His whole existence was one long struggle against circumstances and against himself , to live up to that ideal standard as a writer which he had set before himself from his earliest years ... He remains ever present among us , in spite of the new developments assumed by contempo - rary French literature , for he gave to all writ - ers the most splendid example of passionate , exclusive love of literature .

		With his long years of patient and scrupulous toil , his noble contempt of wealth , honours , and popularity , with his courage in pursuing to the end the realization of his dream , he looms upon us an intellectual hero . ''

		And yet , with all his passion for the imper - sonal , with all his striving to view life from the outside , holding , or at least expressing , `` no form of creed , but contemplating all , '' the final lesson of
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	's life is , as his eulogist ad - mits , that no man may wholly exclude himself from his writings .

		Had the author of '' Madame Bo vary '' really done so , '' they would not have reached us all imbued with that melancholy savour , that subdued pathos which makes them so dear to us .

		... This gift of expressing in their writings more than they themselves sus - pect , and of achieving results exceeding their ambition , is only granted to those courageous and sincere geniuses whose past trials have gained for them the priceless treasure of wide experience .

		Thus did Cervantes write '
Don Quijote	PERSON	, ' and
Defoe	PERSON	'
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	, ' little dreaming that they infused into their writings , the former all the glowing heroism of
Spain	LOCATION	, the latter the dogged self-reliance of the
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	LOCATION	.

		If they had not themselves for many years practised these virtues of chivalrous enter - prise in the one case , of indomitable endurance in the other , their books would have been what they intended them to be mere tales of adven - ture .

		But their souls were greater than their art , and imbued it throughout with that sym - bolic power which is the efficient vitality of books .

		In the same way
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	's soul was greater than his art , and it is that soul which , in spite of his own will , he breathed into his writings , gaining for them a place apart in the history of the contemporary French novel . ''

		Thus we come back , after all , to the position that heroism in literary production is somehow the outcome or reflex of something heroic in the character and the temper of the writer .

		It may be only a streak , so blended with others as to be almost undiscernible to observers of the man apart from his books , yet it is the deepest and truest part of him , and a noble book of any sort may well give pause to the judgment that too hastily condemns a man 's life because it is visibly flawed .

		But those men are the fittest subjects for hero-worship in whom the life and the word are the most fully conso - nant , whose lives are poems , and whose words are acts .

		Such a hero was Goethe , with his life-long devotion to the ideal that held the whole of life to be even more important than its separate elements of the good and the beau - tiful ; such was
Milton	PERSON	, whose '' soul was like a star , and dwelt apart , '' and yet whose heart '' the lowliest duties on herself did lay '' ; such was
Dante	PERSON	, whose exiled soul still '' possessed the sun and stars , '' and whose divine poem was wrought not as a poem merely , but '' With close heed Lest , having spent for the work 's sake Six days , the man be left to make . ''

		A MODERN TYPE OF UNIVERSITY INSTRUCTOR AT
BERLIN	LOCATION	.

		The treatment of German literature in universi - ties has been as varied as the philosophical , political , aesthetic , philological , and psychological ideals of those who have represented it .

		During recent years , the '' Young Grammarian '' school , to which the monuments of literature have served chiefly as a medium for the exhibition of organic processes in language , has exercised great influence in
America	LOCATION	.

		The attractiveness of this school is not hard to ex - plain : it had , while still `` young , '' the freshness of all beginnings , and it was a field in which a given amount of specialized research was rewarded by a maximum quantity of material and new results .

		Whether the school has already reaped its best fruits , is a fair question , though one which does not properly belong here .

		Certain it is that its methods of research have intruded entirely too much into the field of literary history ; and the inquiry can not be avoided , especially in the
United States	LOCATION	, whether the great widening of the scope of Germanic courses has been accompanied by a corresponding deepening of their contents .

		The most successful and popular among the pro- fessors of the humanities in the
University of Berlin	ORGANIZATION	is one who deals with the broadest realities , and who lays the chief accent upon the aesthetic element .

		I have not been able to get figures as to the attend - ance upon the three courses given by Professor
Erich Schmidt	PERSON	during the winter semester , but they were all crowded ; the '' private '' course on Faust 108 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, must have included five hundred enthusiastic hearers .

		The underlying conception of Professor
Schmidt	PERSON	's influential position in this central uni - versity is that he stands as a guardian of the na - tional literary treasure , and has the duty of being fully acquainted with it himself , of preserving it unimpaired , and of demonstrating it to others .

		His ideal of criticism aims at arriving at the sum-total of all those factors which have united to produce literature : on the one hand , the historical and philo - logical treatment of national culture , of the '' spirit of the times , '' and of general intellectual move - ments ; and , on the other hand , the sharpest possible characterization of the individual author .

		His chief virtuosity lies in tracing the historical genesis of a given work after the method of natural science , following the sources , with much elegance of demon - stration , back to their earliest germs , and controlling for this purpose an immense store of information , embracing the ancient classics and the literature of
France	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	,
Spain	LOCATION	, and
Italy	LOCATION	.

		The most convincing impression which Professor
Schmidt	PERSON	's lectures have made upon me has been that of the absolute interdependence of the peoples of culture , the emphasis of the fact that no author or period can be conceived of as standing alone , unconnected with a long chain of preexisting influ - ences ; that a pedantic conception of '' plagiarism '' is most irrational .

		Particularly has he placed in the light of a new revelation the enormous influence of the great and noble English national literature upon
Germany	LOCATION	.

		In the treatment of this matter , as in many other ways , he shows absolute candor , fearlessness of results , and disregard of popular prejudices in dealing with scientific truths .

		The treatment is throughout objective rather than dog - matically philosophical .

		He is equally masterful in estimating the total tendency of a period , in an appreciation of the entire personality of an author or of a single work ; as a rule , such concrete judg - ments disclose the larger points of view .

		Every product is scrupulously tested and stamped with its exact value , a very different thing from a reca - pitulation of its contents .

		These estimates are the perfection of condensed expression ; each word is weighed on the gold-balance , and produces its full effect .

		One lively epithet sometimes fixes for good the final worth of an elaborate work .

		In these judgments , with all their directness and finality , there is to be noticed the self-restraint and reserve of a large nature , and an abstinence from arbitrary personal bias .

		In treating of a period , while much attention is paid to the workings of international influence , there is also a consideration of the force of political life upon literature .

		In dealing with an author , an estimate is made of the various sides of his personality , his growth and development , his methods , his merits and limitations , how far he is the child of his age , and how far he reaches beyond it ; his biography is considered as far as it is con - nected with his literary activity , and , especially , an estimate is given of his permanent contribution to the national literary stock .

		In the discussion of an individual work , there is the consideration of its relation to the times in which it was written , of its structural technique , style , movement , and psycho - logical workings ; of its nearer and remoter sources , especially the history , as far as it can be traced , of its chief motif .

		The influence of the work upon its own and later times is weighed .

		In matters relating to form and metrical values , Professor
Schmidt	PERSON	shows , what all professors do not possess , the finest feeling for rhythm and delicate internal harmo - j nies .

		Not less admirable than these positive critical | deliverances are the wise omissions : the throwing j overboard of merely microscopic details in linguis - tics , biography , and bibliography .

		The last matter is usually disposed of by naming the best edition of the text , and perhaps the titles of one or two new books ; and then come the words , '' for the rest , see Goedeke . ''

		Professor
Schmidt	PERSON	, as was also the case with
Scherer	PERSON	, has made Goethe-studies the crown of his work ; and it is particularly in the presentation of the results of his detailed researches in this field that one notices a favorable contrast with that phi - lology which of late years has lavished such elabo - rate pains upon the publication of Unedited Scraps from
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's Waste-basket .

		I can not speak too highly in praise of Professor
Schmidt	PERSON	's own literary style : it is clear , direct , and penetrating ; not a word is to be spared , and yet it is wrought out to a finished perfection of form not unworthy of one who in literary criticism stands in direct succession to
Lessing	PERSON	and
Herder	ORGANIZATION	,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	and
Schiller	PERSON	.

		This praise must often be withheld from eminent critics : one needs only to mention the choppy , English-Channel style of the admirable
Herman Grimm	PERSON	, which , over here , is usually as - cribed to the influence of our own
Emerson	LOCATION	, but which , in my opinion , stands about as near to that of
Walt Whitman	PERSON	.

		There is lively movement , trenchant diction , brilliant wit , and unreserved hu - mor , but no cheap embellishment ; though occasion - ally metaphorical , the style is always chaste .

		At the same time , Professor Schmidt by no means abhors the crisp , forcible , idiomatic phrases , bor - dering on the very colloquial , in which the German language is so rich , and which often hit the mark squarely in the centre .

		I note with less enthusiasm occasional touches of the distinctively national Ger - man flavor of Derbheit , a term which Anglo-Saxons are prone to translate by the very rude word '' coarse - ness . ''

		Now that co-education has become estab - lished in
Germany	LOCATION	, this feature is at times trying .

		I partly sympathize with the standpoint , and prefer it to that of another professor , who excluded all women from his courses this term because he felt that their presence would lay some restraint upon his freedom of treatment .

		In the academic field , if anywhere , plain facts must be handled without circumlocution , and Professor
Schmidt	PERSON	resolutely asserts '' das gute
Recht	PERSON	der Kritik '' in this direc - tion .

		Good .

		This is quite different , however , from a gratuitous amplification of Aristophanic features ,

		THE DIAL 109 which has more than once been accompanied by hilarious merriment and rapturous applause on the part of the gentlemen of the audience , who looked around gleefully to see how the young women present were '' taking it , '' in an unchivalrous way which made one 's blood boil , but then , chivalry is perhaps not the most strongly emphasized trait in
Bismarck	LOCATION	's
Germany	LOCATION	.

		The delivery is in a power - ful , resonant , dramatic voice , and the lecturer looks his audience squarely in the face , although he fol - lows his manuscript closely .

		Among the select group of young scholars who make up the Seminar , one has a freer opportunity of coming to know the resources which are at the disposal of its leader , to become more and more impressed with his broad grasp of general relations , joined to an immense mass of detailed information , and to see what demands of actual work the great scholar lays upon himself and his students .

		Woe to the youth who attempts by '' brilliancy '' to cover up any negligence in scientific research !

		Still more intimate is the circle of the '' Germanistic Kneipe , '' which comes together every
Monday	DATE	night at the '' Great Elector . ''

		The group includes some of the most brilliant men in
Berlin	LOCATION	literary circles , as well as a small number of advanced students .

		Professor
Schmidt	PERSON	is always there , even when he has to come late after lectures or receptions , and dominates the conversation , which is lively and free and darts with most unexpected bounds into new paths .

		The whole tone of the gatherings is that of harmless , entirely informal good-fellowship , and the talk is less on professional questions than on those of general interest in a highly-cultured society .

		Now and then the evening is given over to pure fun on the part of the students , which the Professor enters into and enjoys more heartily than anyone else .

		At
Christ	LOCATION	- mas-time there was a tree , with presents , poems , music , and a Bierzeitung ; at the close of the semester there was resurrected and presented an ancient comedy of
Holberg	ORGANIZATION	's , with all its archaic accessories .

		Professor
Schmidt	PERSON	's influence on the students is a goodly thing to witness : a free asso - ciation , free imparting , and the great stimulus of personal contact .

		A few words as to Professor
Schmidt	PERSON	's career may not be unwelcome .

		He was born in
Jena	LOCATION	, where his father was a well-known professor of zo - ology .

		From his early days in the gymnasium , his chief interest has lain in modern German literature .

		In
Strassburg	LOCATION	he became an intimate disciple of
Scherer	PERSON	.

		He began teaching in
Wttrzburg	LOCATION	, was for three years decent in
Strassburg	LOCATION	, and later became professor in
Vienna	LOCATION	.

		In
1885	DATE	, when the Goethe archives were made public , the Grand Duchess of
Weimar	LOCATION	invited him , along with
Loeper	PERSON	and
Scherer	PERSON	, to take charge of them , and he has had a responsi - ble share in the
Weimar	LOCATION	edition of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's Works .

		It was during this period , about ten years ago , that his discovery of
Fraulein Gochhausen	PERSON	's copy of the '' original '' text of Faust opened up a new era in the criticism of that work .

		After the death of
Scherer	ORGANIZATION	, in
1886	DATE	, Professor
Schmidt	PERSON	was called to
Berlin	LOCATION	to succeed that unequaled master in the field of the history of German literature .

		He is one of the youngest members of the
Royal Academy of Sciences	ORGANIZATION	.

		His great work on
Lessing	PERSON	, and his fre - quent essays in the field of literary investigation and criticism , show his fertility in production as well as in exposition .

		Personally , he is very hand - some : in the prime of life , with a commanding presence , a superb physique , and overflowing vigor and energy .

		I fancy that I recognize in him vari - ous points of resemblance to
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	.

		A rapid , intense worker in the study , he allows himself to throw off its constraints completely and to enjoy the rich and varied social life which
Berlin	LOCATION	affords ; and he is a much-sought guest in that upper world which unites the leaders of society , the statesmen , thinkers , artists , musicians , and men of letters , and especially where that large group of brilliant and cultured women is to be encountered who lend a fineness and elegance to social life which are missed in regions where the Kneipe of the men is practically the only form of intercourse , but which have been a distin - guishing ornament of
Berlin	LOCATION	for generations .

		For music and the drama , especially , he has the liveliest appreciation .

		Like
Helmholtz	PERSON	, he has broken com - pletely with the traditions of the pedantic , distraught , slipshod '' typical '' German professor , and offers an instance of that particularly modern type a uni - versity instructor of highest rank who is at the same time a finished man of the world in all that con - cerns outward appearance , sense of form , social facility , and address .

		In this may perhaps be traced some influence of his
Vienna	LOCATION	period .

		Probably no Germanic scholar would question the value and legitimacy of any of the points of view from which Professor
Schmidt	PERSON	approaches the treatment of literature : the difficult question , as in most of the practical philosophy of life , is one of proportions .

		It is in his successful harmony of com - bination that I find most to admire .

		An adequate discussion of the whole theme would require an ex - act estimate of the relative treatment of the different factors involved .

		To dismiss the subject with a word , I would say that there is perhaps at times too much dwelling upon that which must be sub - tracted from an author before the essence of his own personality is to be considered .

		In following the elaborate demonstration of external sources , I have sometimes thought of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's sharp criticism of Herder for venturing to mention , in a discussion of '' The Diver , '' the old chronicle in which
Schiller	PERSON	had found the tale .

		The lines laid down by Pro- fessor
Wetz	PERSON	of
Giessen	LOCATION	in his interesting and sug - gestive tract on the study of the history of litera - ture , in which he maintains that the chief emphasis must always be laid upon the psychology of the author , seem to me correct .

		At a time when militarism and industrialism have more than ever before drawn men 's thoughts away from the intellectual inheritance of the past , it is most encouraging that the perennial mission of lit - THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, erature in its highest and deepest sense is being so successfully demonstrated in the great centre of German civilization .

		Nor is this fact without its wholesome lesson of humility to those who have been entrusted with the duty of representing and expound - ing literature , in view of the emphasis which it lays upon the demand for the fullest equipment on the part of those who attempt to carry out this respon - sible task .

		DANTE AS A TONIC FOR TO-DAY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I have been unpleasantly surprised lately at some dis - paraging remarks on
Dante	ORGANIZATION	made by well-known writers .

		One of your contributors , in a recent communication to THE DIAL , speaks rather proudly of the fact that the dust on his copy of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	is undisturbed from year to year ; and a professor of English literature in one of our largest universities , lecturing on the world 's great poets , denies -LRB- according to the statement of one of his students -RRB- to Dante the highest rank in poetry , the basis of his criticism being that the Divine Comedy is too grotesque and too mediaeval to appeal to the modern reader .

		Without desiring to enter into a -LRB- surely unnecessary -RRB- discussion of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's claims to greatness , I should like to indicate briefly why , contrary to the implications in the above remarks , the
Divine Comedy	ORGANIZATION	is of especial value to-day as an antidote to many morbid tendencies in literature .

		1 .

		The poem is a practical one , it is the work of an ardent reformer .

		Many of his ideas on bartering and corrupt politics remind us irresistibly of Dr.
Parkhurst	PERSON	and the
Lexow Commission	ORGANIZATION	.

		His remarks on the evils of indiscriminate and unrestricted immigration might furnish our own congressmen with arguments on this live question of the day .

		His contemptuous and indig - nant rebuke of the vanity of sensational preaching might be read , studied , and inwardly digested by many a pop - ular preacher of the present time .

		His religious ideals are high , and as sound as those of to-day -LRB- due allowance being made for the difference of the times -RRB- .

		In many respects they coincide with those of Luther himself .

		2 .

		There has been a great deal of discussion in recent years on the conflict between realism and idealism .

		It is interesting to note how
Dante	ORGANIZATION	illustrates and com - bines both of these theories .

		Many of his pictures of Hell are repulsive almost disgusting and photo - graphic in their minuteness .

		He never hesitates to call a thing by its right name .

		He , as well as the modern novelists , saw the grossness of life the sensuousness , the lust for power and wealth , and all the meanness of the heart of man ; yet he , unlike them , saw also the noble , the sweet , and the tender side of life .

		Balzac and Zola have written only Infernos ;
Dante	ORGANIZATION	has given us a Purgatory and a Paradise .

		3 .

		One of the noblest qualities of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	is his indom - itable optimism , in spite of sorrows , injustice , hardships ; and his unfailing belief in the inherent goodness of man and the final triumph of right .

		Throughout these scenes of sin and vice , of violence and of spiritual wick - edness in high places , we hear , as it were , a clear , sweet voice , like that in
Browning	PERSON	's ''
Pippa	PERSON	Passes '' singing the words , '' God 's in his heaven , All 's right with the world .

		1 ' There is no moral weakness in the Divine Comedy , no whining despair , none of that melancholy which brooded over the early nineteenth century literature , and which still lingers on in the form of a cynical pessimism .

		4 .

		But the greatest of all benefits to be derived from the study of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	lies in his deep and all-pervading spirituality .

		Endowed with marvellous intellectual power , with an ardent interest in all kinds of science and learning , a practical politician and man of affairs , he yet saw all earthly things against the background of eternity .

		No poem ever written has left the reader so impressed with the reality of the unseen world .

		Surely never were such lessons needed more than in the present materialistic age .

		I believe , with Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	, that the lover of books should first of all seek to become intimate with the great poets in the world 's literature ; and I have endeavored to carry out this theory in my own case .

		I trust that I do not undervalue the genius and power of Homer ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, and
Milton	LOCATION	; but were I to be asked '' What one book outside of the Bible would you recommend as a life-long companion , not merely from an intellectual or literary standpoint , but as a moral and spiritual aid ? ''

		I should unhesitatingly answer , `` The Divine Comedy of Dante . ''

		It is a de - lightful thing to yield to the charm of the sensuous beauty of
Keats	PERSON	, to drink in the elegant music of Ten - nyson , to penetrate the spirit of Nature with Words - worth .

		The joy thus inspired may be compared to that inspired by moonlit
summer	DATE	nights ; or by long golden afternoons spent beneath forest trees or in sunny glades touched with the magic beauty of fairy-land ; or by those hours of quiet reflection when '' Even the motion of our human blood Almost suspended , we are laid asleep In body , and become a living soul . ''

		But how inferior are even such elevated joys as these to the exultation felt by the mountain climber , when after long hours of toil and hardship and escape from danger , in which every faculty of mind and body has been called into action , he reaches the summit and experiences what Mr.
Whymper	PERSON	calls `` one glorious hour of life . ''

		Such is the joy , deep , lasting , ennobling , that fills the soul of the patient student of
Dante	LOCATION	; this is the reward of him who reads the Divine Comedy '' with the spirit and with the understanding also . ''

		A HISTORY OF THE BRITISH
NAVY	ORGANIZATION	.

		* The initial volume of Mr.
Laird Clowes	PERSON	's History of the
Royal Navy	ORGANIZATION	gives abundant assurance that the completed work will satis - factorily supply what has been a long - felt want .

		The work is planned upon a sufficiently liberal and comprehensive scale .

		It is to be divided into fifteen historical sections -LRB- of which six are included in the opening volume -RRB- , each corre - sponding either with the duration of a dynasty , or of a political period , or of a great war .

		The first section covers the period previous to
1066	DATE	, beginning with the primitive and partly conjec - tural maritime activities of the early Britons ; the second covers the Norman Age
1066	DATE	to
1154	DATE	; the third , the Angevin Age
1154	DATE	to
1399	DATE	; the fourth , the Lancastrian and Yorkist Age
1399	DATE	to
1485	DATE	; the fifth , the Tudor Age
1485	DATE	to
1603	DATE	; the sixth , the first Stuart Age
1603	DATE	to
1649	DATE	; the seventh , the time of the Commonwealth
1649	DATE	to
1660	DATE	; the eighth , the age of the Restoration and the Revolution 1660 to
1714	DATE	; the ninth , the early Han - overian Age 1714 to 1763 ; the tenth , the period of American Revolution
1763	DATE	to
1793	DATE	; the eleventh , the wars of the French Revolu - tion
1793	DATE	to 1802 ; the twelfth , the
Napo	ORGANIZATION	- leonic and American wars 1802 to
1815	DATE	; the thirteenth , the period from
1815	DATE	to the build - ing of the first ironclads in
1856	DATE	; the four - teenth and last section , the period since
1856	DATE	.

		Each section is subdivided into chapters deal - ing respectively with the civil and the military sides of British naval history and with the his - tory of voyages and maritime discovery during the period under review .

		The work will be completed in five royal octavo volumes , appear - ing at the rate of a volume every six months .

		The volumes are to be separately indexed .

		Warned by the example of his too sanguine predecessor , Sir
Harris Nicolas	PERSON	-LRB- who undertook single-handed a work of considerably more than Gibbonian proportions , and died at the outset of it -RRB- , Mr.
Clowes	PERSON	has planned his book upon a liberal yet feasible scale , and has availed himself to a judicious extent of the advantages of cooperation .

		An ample corps of assistants has aided him in the preparatory work of mak - ing researches , copying documents , hunting up portraits , plans , and so on .

		Besides these sub - * THE ROYAL NAVY : A History from the
Earliest Times	ORGANIZATION	to the Present .

Brown , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		altern helpers , eminent writers especially qual - ified for their respective tasks have aided Mr.
Clowes	PERSON	in the treatment of those periods into the records of which his own researches have been confessedly relatively imperfect .

		Sir
Clements Markham	PERSON	has contributed ten chap - ters on the history of voyages and discoveries from
1485	DATE	to present times ; the very important chapter on the major naval campaigns of
1763	DATE	-
1793	DATE	falls to the share of Captain
A. T. Mahan	PERSON	to whom , we fancy , is mainly due the newly - awakened interest of our English friends in the comparatively neglected maritime history of their country ; Mr.
H. W. Wilson	PERSON	-LRB- author of '' Ironclads in Action '' -RRB- contributes chapters on the history of voyages and discoveries up to
1485	DATE	, and upon that of the minor naval opera - tions from
1763	DATE	to
1815	DATE	-LRB- except those of the War of
1812	DATE	-RRB- ; the story of the War of
1812	DATE	is magnanimously entrusted to Mr.
Theodore Roosevelt	PERSON	; Mr.
Edward Fraser	PERSON	writes the two chapters on the military history of the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	, from
1603	DATE	to
1660	DATE	.

		It will be noticed that the delicate task -LRB- Mr.
Clowes	PERSON	's book being of course intended scarcely less for the use of American readers than of English ones -RRB- of treating of the periods of active hostilities be - tween this country and
England	LOCATION	has been entrusted to two American writers .

		On this point Mr.
Clowes	PERSON	feels constrained to add a word or so incidentally , though he does it '' a little unwillingly . '' ''

		When it became known in the
United States	LOCATION	that my friends Captain
Mahan	PERSON	and Mr.
Theodore Roosevelt	PERSON	were to contribute to the book chapters dealing with our unhappy conflicts with
America	LOCATION	, a certain
New York	LOCATION	literary journal , which generally displays better taste , congratulated itself that at last English readers would be told the whole truth about those wars .

		It went on to insinuate with gratuitous offensiveness that , although Captain
Mahan	PERSON	, being perhaps spoilt by British appre - ciation of his books , might hesitate to speak out , Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	might be trusted to reflect American opinion in its most uncompromising form , and that I might live to be sorry for having secured the cooperation of that distinguished writer and administrator . ''

		Trusting that the offending journal will , '' if only for the sake of international and personal comity , '' refrain from repeating the observa - tions in question , the writer goes on to say : '' The point that struck me as being most ungenerous in the attack of the
New York	LOCATION	paper was the sugges - tion directed , not against us Britons , but against Captain
Mahan	PERSON	and Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	.

		To insinuate that one of these is capable of deliberately subtracting from the truth in order to pander to English vanity and that the other is capable of deliberately adorning the truth in order to pander to
American Chauvinism	ORGANIZATION	, is surely to outrage the honor of both and to besmirch the dignity of American history . ''

		112 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, Mr.
Clowes	PERSON	takes this matter altogether too seriously ; and it was certainly unwise to devote an entire page or more of what is meant to be a durable and authoritative historical work to a casual newspaper fling that would have other - wise escaped general notice .

		The
New York	LOCATION	allusion to Captain
Mahan	PERSON	certainly seems ill - advised , if not ill-natured ; and it may perhaps be construed as hinting an opinion that that distinguished author has been guilty of grow - ing suspiciously warm over the achievements of British valor and seamanship , in a book whose success was largely conditioned upon its fav - orable reception at the hands of the British public .

		But it must be remembered that Captain
Mahan	PERSON	is himself a seaman .

		He has written of his profession with professional enthusiasm .

		The annals of
Trafalgar	ORGANIZATION	,
Lepanto	ORGANIZATION	, and
Mobile Bay	LOCATION	, of the exploits of
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	, De Euyter , and
Jean Bart	PERSON	, of Farragut and
Decatur	LOCATION	, are alike the muniments of his calling .

		Captain
Mahan	PERSON	undertook the task of demonstrating the his - torical glory and importance of that calling ; of making clear the potent influence of
Sea Power	ORGANIZATION	upon history .

		A moment 's reflection ought to show any American mentally above the `` jingo '' stage of patriotism that it would have been impossible for Captain
Mahan	PERSON	to do justice to his thesis without dilating somewhat warmly upon the achievements of that nation whose annals afford him by far the most cogent proofs of the soundness of it that is to say , without producing a book that English readers would find especially palatable .

		No one conversant with Captain
Mahan	PERSON	's works , and capable of appreciating their characteristically candid and philosophical spirit , will doubt for a moment that his promised contribution to Mr.
Clowes	PERSON	's book will be , whatever the international issues he is called upon to discuss , as free from the appre - hended tendency to '' pander to British vanity , '' on the one hand , as from that to defer to Amer - ican '' jingoism , '' on the other .

		If there be in
England	LOCATION	or
America	LOCATION	a writer upon whom intel - ligent and liberal people of both countries would be likely to cordially unite as a specially desirable expositor and judge of those issues , that writer is undoubtedly Captain
Mahan	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Clowes	PERSON	's not unrighteous indignation over the innuendo at
Captain Mahan	ORGANIZATION	's expense leads him perhaps into some misconception of his critic 's comfortable prediction as to Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	.

		To predict that in the forthcoming history the honeyed words of the former would be duly offset by the plain truths of the latter , is not necessarily to brand Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	as a '' good American '' of the obstreperous type so distressing to '' The Nation , '' for example , or to insinuate that he is morally capable of re - garding the task entrusted to him by the con - fiding Mr.
Clowes	PERSON	chiefly as a splendid oppor - tunity to advance his political prospects at home by treating his countrymen to an ener - getic display of '' tail-twisting . ''

		Probably all that the
New York	LOCATION	writer meant to convey as to Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	was his conviction that that plain-spoken and somewhat positive gentleman might safely be looked to for a more forcible and explicit statement of the American side of the standing disputes arising out of the unlooked - for results of the naval engagements of
1812	DATE	than our English friends have been accustomed to find in the accounts of their own historians .

		That the
British Navy	ORGANIZATION	can be worsted , is a proposition the average Briton finds next to impossible to entertain ; that the
British Navy	ORGANIZATION	was worsted , disastrously and almost uniformly , by the American in
1812	DATE	, is the plainest of historical facts , and is no more to be denied than that the French were beaten at
Trafalgar	ORGANIZATION	, or , we may say -LRB- with some misgivings -RRB- , than that the American land forces were pretty gen - erally and rather ignominiously beaten by the British at the outset of the war in question .

		The fact , then , of British naval defeat in
1812	DATE	being sun-clear and undeniable , it has obviously remained for British patriotism to solace and reassure itself by accounting for that fact in a way that may not only save , but even redound to , the credit of the vanquished .

		Essentially , these explanations amount to the plea that in nearly every one of the famous sea-duels of
1812	DATE	the British ship was at the outset so greatly overmatched in point of tonnage or armament or general condition , that , even though defeated , she bore off the real honors of the day , while her antagonist was entitled only to that dubious sort of glory a big or a strong man may claim as the victor in a phys - ical encounter with a small or a weak one .

		Such is the relatively comfortable view most English authorities incline to of the actions between the '' United States '' and the ''
Mace	PERSON	- donian , '' the '' Constitution '' and the '' Guer - riere , '' the '' Constitution '' and the ''
Java	LOCATION	, '' and so on .

		The view taken of them in
England	LOCATION	at the time they occurred was hardly so cheer - ful , judging from the tenor of some extracts from the press given in Mr.
Maclay	PERSON	's interest - ing work .

		Even the '' Times '' seems to have been wrought up into a state bordering on hys - teria , as the tidings of successive British defeats
1897	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 113 came in .

		The loss of the first frigate is an - nounced with grave surprise , as a passing instance of the inscrutable ways of
Providence	LOCATION	, and is duly deplored in a tone of funereal de - corum .

		But when the news of the loss of the second frigate came in , the '' Thunderer '' was moved to exclaim : '' In the name of God , what was done with this im - mense superiority of -LSB- British -RSB- force !

		Oh , what a charm is hereby dissolved !

		The land spell of the French is broken -LSB- alluding to
Napoleon	PERSON	's retreat from
Moscow	LOCATION	-RSB- , and so is our sea spell ! ''

		Still deeper and more genuine is the note of consternation in the '' Times 's '' comments on the loss of the ''
Java	LOCATION	, '' the third frigate in suc - cession beaten in single fight by the vessels of the young Republic that had dared question the right of the Mistress of the Seas to rule her empire with the irresponsible sway of a Turkish pasha : '' This is an occurrence that calls for serious reflec - tion this , and the fact stated in our paper of yester - day , that
Lloyd	PERSON	's list contains notices of upward of five hundred British vessels captured in seven months by the Americans .

		Five hundred merchantmen and three fri - gates !

		Can these statements be true ?

		And can the English people hear them unmoved ?

		Anyone who had predicted such a result of the American war this time last year would have been treated as a madman or a traitor .

		He would have been told , if his opponents had condescended to argue with him , that long ere seven months had elapsed the American flag would have been swept from the seas , the contemptible navy of the
United States	LOCATION	annihilated , and their marine arsenals rendered a heap of ruins .

		Yet down to this moment not a single American frigate has struck her flag . ''

		It would be ungenerous to grudge our En - glish friends any reasonable lenitive to the smarts of their admitted maritime reverses of
1812	DATE	; but we fervently hope that Mr.
Roose	PERSON	- velt , in his forthcoming chapter on those events , will , while doing full justice to British valor and seamanship -LRB- to belittle which would be to belittle our own achievements -RRB- , at least politely but firmly insist , with due marshalling of admis - sible evidence , that the American victories were not on the whole , what some English writers in effect labor to show , rather discreditable than otherwise to the victors .

		To recur to and widen the application of our former Biblical illustra - tion , it was assuredly the navy of the infant Republic , not that of
Great Britain	LOCATION	, that in
1812	DATE	paralleled the conduct of the Hebrew stripling who braved the might of Goliath of
Gath	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Clowes	PERSON	's work is not , of course , to be , what usually passes for naval history , a mere narrative of sea-fights .

		In addition to giving the more familiar story of military exploits and great voyages of exploration and discovery , it will deal extensively with what may be called the natural history of the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	.

		The evolution of the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	as a national establishment will be traced in reasonable detail , as will the development of naval architecture , from the pinnace -LRB- picta -RRB- , or great British war-canoe of
Caesar	ORGANIZATION	's day , down to the huge and complex constructions of modern times .

		The later chapters of the work are to contain copious accounts of the evolution of modern ships and armament .

		The social life of the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	, a rather promising topic , will not be neglected .

		Judging from the profusion of interesting specimens before us , the illustra - tions are to be precisely what they should be real lights on the text , and not mere embellish - ments .

		They can not be better or more com - plimentarily characterized than by likening them to the invaluable plates in Mrs.
J. R. Green	PERSON	's admirable edition of her late husband 's magnum opus .

		Mr.
Clowes	PERSON	's undertaking is a very important one , largely and liberally con - ceived , and , thus far , carried out in a way upon which he and his publishers are to be warmly congratulated .

		As the only complete history of the
British Navy	ORGANIZATION	, the work can scarcely fail of the substantial success it now bids fair to deserve .

		AN ENGLISH BARD AND HIS SCOTCH EDITOR .

		* Mr.
Henley	PERSON	's edition of the Letters of Lord
Byron	PERSON	form the initial volume of what ought to prove a work of prime importance in its kind : a definitive edition or at least an amply anno - tated edition of the works in prose and verse of one of the greatest of English poets .

		Mr.
Henley	PERSON	's purpose in writing these very full and excursive notes may best be set forth in his own words : '' I have written on the theory that to know something of
Byron	PERSON	, one should know something of the aims and lives and personalities of contemporary men and women , with something of the social and political con - ditions which made his triumph possible .

		I can not believe that this first instalment , for all its bulk , will go far towards the accomplishment of such an end .

		But I confess to cherishing a hope that , by the time I have finished my task , I shall be found to have formed a col - lection of facts and portraitures , which , by making for a juster apprehension of the quality and temper of
Byron	PERSON	's environment , will make for a more intimate understand - ing of
Byron	PERSON	's character and
Byron	PERSON	's achievement .

		Both these are extraordinary ; neither can be explained , or * THE WORKS OF LORD

		114 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, shouted , or sniffed away ; and it is merely futile to attempt an estimate of either till one can do so with some knowledge of revelant and significant circumstances , and with a certain sympathy -LRB- or the reverse , if it must be so -RRB- , with the influences under which the character was developed and the achievement done . ''

		From these prefatory remarks it is evident that Mr.
Henley	PERSON	has formed a clear and bold conception of his duty as an editor ; and , from this first completed volume , it is equally evident that he is competent to the energetic carrying - out of this considerable enterprise .

		Indeed , whatever editorial defects Mr.
Henley	PERSON	may ex - hibit , deficiency in energy is certainly not one of them .

		If sympathy with his author , and an energy and vivacity scarcely second to the en - ergy and vivacity of his author , were the only qualifications of an editor , then might Mr.
Henley	PERSON	be pronounced an almost ideal editor of Byron .

		In one respect these notes to
Byron	PERSON	's letters may be considered a greater achievement than the letters themselves .

		Mr.
Henley	PERSON	in his notes is as far from being dull as is Byron in the letters .

		Considering how much rarer a lit - erary product than a body of interesting letters is a body of interesting notes about equal in bulk , Mr.
Henley	PERSON	's performance is certainly remarkable , perhaps unprecedented .

		After reading one of
Byron	PERSON	's racy letters one learns to turn with something like instinctive eagerness to the notes , which are seldom disappointing , after the usual manner of notes , and which fre - quently surprise by their fulness and apposite - ness of illustration .

		As might be expected from the programme laid down by Mr.
Henley	PERSON	in his Preface , a large portion of the notes is devoted to biographical comment upon
Byron	PERSON	's friends and acquaintances .

		The material for this por - tion of the notes is evidently selected for the illustration it furnishes of those characteristics in which
Byron	PERSON	's times differ from our own , and it is put together with great literary skill .

		We shall look forward with unusual interest to the volumes of this edition which are to fol - low .

		We would not say one word that might tend to do aught but encourage Mr.
Henley	PERSON	in his enterprise .

		But a Scotchman is not easily discouraged ; and no harm is likely to come of a frank statement of the defects of an editor who has already scored so signal a success .

		In a word , then , Mr.
Henley	PERSON	's defect is a defect of temper .

		He annotates a passionate author pas - sionately .

		His confident and minatory attitude excites suspicion or irritation .

		He fails to treat persons who in any way incurred
Byron	PERSON	's dis - pleasure with anything of what the French nicely term menagement .

		As an example of a note which is probably as untrue as it is brutal , take this upon
Byron	PERSON	's mother : '' In person she was dumpy and plain , in disposition passionate , in temper furious and tyrannical , in mind a superstitious dullard , and in manners a naturally awk - ward and untrained provincial . ''

		The notes upon
Byron	PERSON	's sporting proclivities are full of curious information .

		In
1807	DATE	,
Byron	PERSON	mentions to Miss
Pigot	PERSON	a swim of three miles '' in the Thames from Lambeth through the two bridges , Westminster and Blackfriars . ''

		Mr.
Henley	PERSON	notes : '' This was
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	's first glimpse of Byron .

		He witnessed the performance in part , and he ' noticed a respectable , manly-looking person , who was eying some - thing in the distance ' -LRB-
Byron	ORGANIZATION	's head -RRB- .

		The < manly - looking ' one was Gentleman
Jackson	PERSON	. ''

		Upon this worthy there is a long and entertain - ing note , from which we make an excerpt or two : '' Yet for over thirty years he was the most picture - esque and commanding figure in the sporting world , and exercised an influence unique in its annals .

		The truth is , he was a vast deal more than an accomplished boxer and teacher of boxing and a brilliant all-round athlete .

		He was also a man of character and integrity polite , agreeable , reputable , a capital talker , a person of tact and energy and charm ...
Byron	PERSON	had always a great regard for
Jackson	PERSON	; walked with him at
Cambridge	LOCATION	, and told an excited remonstrant that '
Jackson	PERSON	's man - ners are infinitely superior to those of the fellows of my college whom I meet at the high table . ' ''

		After a good deal more about
Jackson	PERSON	, the annotator goes on to relate how
Moore	PERSON	went with him in
1818	DATE	to see the fight between Tur - ner and '' the Nonpareil '' at Crawley Downs : '' It lasted two hours and twenty minutes , and
Keats	PERSON	, who saw it , ' tapped his fingers on the window pane , ' to give
Cowden Clarke	PERSON	an idea of the rapidity of the Non - pareil 's hits . ''

		Had Byron been in
England	LOCATION	at the time , there would have been three poets among the spec - tators .

		In the still longer and not less inter - esting note apropos of '' '
Bob Gregson	PERSON	,
P.P.	LOCATION	' -LRB- ` Poet of Pugilism ' -RRB- , '' Mr.
Henley	PERSON	reminds us that
Byron	PERSON	was '' a member of the
Pugilistic Club	ORGANIZATION	one of the hundred and fifty
Corin	PERSON	- thians , that is , with whose countenance and inside whose ropes and stakes all decent mills were done . ''

		This note after a long digres - sion containing a Scotch laird 's account of a fight -LRB- at which Byron must have been present -RRB- between
Cribb	PERSON	, the renowned '' glutton , '' and
Jem Belcher	PERSON	, '' the man of genius who had re - inspired and renewed the art , '' concludes as follows : '' A dreadful age , no doubt : for all its solid founda - tions , of faith and dogma in the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, and of virtue and solvency in the
State	ORGANIZATION	, a fierce , drunken , gambling , ' keeping , ' adulterous , high-living , hard-drinking , hard - hitting , brutal age .

		But it was
Byron	PERSON	's ; and
Don Juan	PERSON	1897 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 115 and The Giaour me as naturally its outcomes as Absalom and
Achitophel	ORGANIZATION	is an expression of the Restoration , and In Memoriam a product of Victorian England . ''

		It is in the note of five pages in small type upon
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	that Mr.
Henley	PERSON	gives the freest play to his satirical vein .

		For Hunt 's book on `` Lord
Byron	PERSON	and his Contemporaries '' there can be no forgiveness : accordingly Mr.
Henley	PERSON	pursues Hunt with a ferocity which the good-natured
Byron	PERSON	would himself have been the first , at least in his cooler moments , to deprecate .

		The reputation of Hunt is macer - ated in a caldron containing all the most spiteful things ever said about him , the whole steeped in the vitriol which is Mr.
Henley	PERSON	's peculiar product .

		This '' character '' -LRB- as they used to say in the seventeenth century -RRB- concludes as follows : '' It is fair to add that Hunt wrote with true piety of
Shelley	PERSON	-LRB- but if , as
Trelawney	ORGANIZATION	says , he really did pre - fer his own Muse before
Shelley	PERSON	's , the density of his conceit is not to be expressed in terms of words -RRB- and
Keats	PERSON	; that he lived to a green old age ; that he num - bered
Carlyle	PERSON	among his many friends ; and that another of them ,
Charles Dickens	PERSON	, was severely taken to task for presenting him as the
Harold Skimpole	PERSON	of
Bleak House	ORGANIZATION	.

		A person of parts , no doubt of parts , and a certain charm , and a facile , amiable , liquorish tempera - ment .

		But there was no clearer , keener vision than
Keats	PERSON	's ; and I fear that
Keats	PERSON	's word about
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	must be remembered as the last . ''

		It is evident that the fear expressed by Mr.
Henley	PERSON	in the last sentence is not very distress - ing to him .

		Keats 's remark that Hunt was '' vain , egotistical , and disgusting in taste and morals '' was probably born of a passing mood of suspicious irritability .

		That it could not have been his settled conviction seems to be shown by his friendly relations with Hunt be - fore and after .

		To quote such a remark as a final judgment is something more than uncrit - ical , it is malicious .

		Keats 's vision was un - doubtedly at times clear and keen , although apt to be colored by his moods ;
Carlyle	PERSON	's vision especially his eye for a charlatan was cer - tainly '' clearer and keener '' ; and
Carlyle	PERSON	, after the searching test of a house-to-house intimacy with Hunt for many years , wrote of him and to him with warm and reverent admiration .

		Our own
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	, whose fault was certainly not lack of clearness and keenness of vision , found it in his heart to pronounce Leigh Hunt '' as pure - minded a man as ever lived . ''

		A good rule is to distrust a critic of Mr.
Henley	PERSON	's acerbity when he begins with a profession of fairness -LRB- '' it is fair to add '' -RRB- : it means mischief .

		Had Mr.
Henley	PERSON	really meant to be fair , he would have added that
Dickens	PERSON	earnestly disclaimed any intention of portraying
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	in the character of
Harold Skimpole	PERSON	. ''

		He was in all public and private transactions the very soul of truth and honor , '' said
Dickens	PERSON	.

		While not one of the masterful minds of his time ,
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	was one of the most educative writers .

		Few men have exhibited in the profession of letters more genuine heroism .

		Happy would it be for the world if some men of more vivid genius had set an example of equal magnan - imity and equal purity in the exercise of the literary craft .

		Even
Moore	PERSON	, the devoted friend of
Byron	PERSON	, does not wholly escape Mr.
Henley	PERSON	's lash .

		His translation of the `` Odes of Anacreon , '' to which he owed the nickname of
Anacreon Moore	PERSON	, is done '' as it were into scented soap . ''

		His '' Loves of the Angels '' is '' a mild Whig Paradise , done by a tame , suburban Byron . ''

		As to character , '' For all the smirk in his love-songs and the sting -LRB- as of nettles -RRB- in his satire , he was a worthy and magnanimous little man . ''

		-LRB- And such we trust , little or big , is Mr.
Henley	PERSON	! -RRB-

		In
Francis Jeffrey	PERSON	, Mr.
Henley	PERSON	has a fair mark , which he hits square in the bull 's - eye : '' At the time of
Byron	PERSON	's writing ,
Jeffrey	PERSON	, a sound enough critic according to his lights , had edited The
Edinburgh Review	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- 1802 -RRB- for some ten years , and had made it the first periodical in the world .

		His chief faults as an editor were -LRB- 1 -RRB- a trick of mixing politics with criti - cism , so that your Tory seldom , if ever , got fair play at his hands ; and -LRB- 2 -RRB- a tendency to be ' high-sniffing ' and superior , which prevented him from considering anybody , or anything , excepting from his own peculiar point of view , which was that of a flippant -LRB- because divinely gifted -RRB- Whig .

		Hence some enormous blunders and an influence which made on the whole for mischief , and was not more bitterly resented than it deserved . ''

		If Mr.
Henley	PERSON	carries out his undertaking in the spirit and with the verve of the present volume , he is likely to produce the most vivid and interesting body of notes with which the life and works of any English author have been illustrated .

		But Mr.
Henley	PERSON	, like
Byron	PERSON	him - self , has the defect of his quality .

		He is either too kindred in spirit to
Byron	LOCATION	, or else he is too opinionated a Scotchman , to be a critic of dis - crimination .

		He is over-vigorous , over-confi - dent , over-much in sympathy with his author .

		All his portraits are sharply etched in black - and-white , his penchant for black has been sufficiently exemplified .

		He pays court to Clio in much the same cavalier way in which
John Byron	PERSON	paid court to
Miss Gordon	LOCATION	of Gight .

		Having possessed himself of her ma - terial treasures , he leaves her , little dreaming that the Muse of History never yields her most 116 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, precious secrets either to the cajoler or to the bully .

		It is not of the Kingdom of the Truth that it was said that men of violence take it by force .

		The Truth most frequently lies in the nuance , the delicate distinction , the fleeting glimpse , the anxiously qualified phrase ; and in these your men of violence , your Byrons ,
Macaulays	PERSON	, and Henleys , deal not .

		To say this is not to deny their usefulness , but to de - termine their limitation .

		Writers of this class may be interesting in a thousand ways : they may whip us into wholesome activity with their passion , sting us with their satire , move us with their eloquence , melt us with their pathos , en - ergise us with their power .

		But one function , at least , is reserved for writers of a more con - templative cast , of a quieter style : and that is , to make us give ear to the '' still small voice '' of Truth .

1887	DATE	many of these tablets were offered for sale in
Cairo	LOCATION	; and it was then discovered that the natives had ruthlessly broken the larger tablets in order to conceal and carry them more easily .

		Of their content , nothing was known .

		In the

February 18	DATE	and
March 24 , 1888	DATE	, Professor Sayce offered an account of some of the tablets in the pos - session of
M. Bouriant	ORGANIZATION	in

		The names of the two Pharaohs written in cuneiform were identified with their hieroglyphic forms by
Erman	PERSON	; and thus at once it was clear why the letters were found at
Tell-el-Amarna	ORGANIZATION	, the capital built by Amenho - tep IV .

		Such a find as this has necessarily brought out an extensive literature of the subject -LRB- see Bezold-Budge , '' Tell-el-Amarna Tablets , '' pp .

		; but it is only in Dr.
Winckler	PERSON	's book on '' The Tell-el-Amarna Letters '' that all the texts have been collected and transla - ted .

		It therefore forms the most convenient source for this material which the historian can find .

		The letters , of which there are two hundred and ninety-six , fall into two main classes , ac - cording to Dr.
Winckler	PERSON	: I. , '' Letters from Kings of
Western Asia	LOCATION	, '' thirty-six in number ; and II. , '' Letters from Phosnician and

		Space will not permit any detailed criticism of the translations , or any account of the content of this remarkable correspondence .

		The translation from the German very notice - ably shows the influence of the German idiom , especially in the preface ; and a few misprints are also present , e. g. , Rainapa for Rianapa -LRB- p. 337 -RRB- , and '' loin '' for loan -LRB- on p. 413 -RRB- .

		THE DIAL 117 FOCALIZED ox THE BIBLE .

		* The versatile mind and pen of Dean
Farrar	PERSON	have brightened and lightened many a page within the
past quarter	DATE	- century .

		Biblical literature and
Chris	PERSON	- tian history have received rich bequests from the fertility of his brain and the deftness of his hand .

		His latest volume contains a collection of some of his choicest thoughts on the meaning and supremacy of the
Bible	LOCATION	.

		The book contains twenty-three chap - ters on a wide scope of themes .

		But these may be classified as treating -LRB- 1 -RRB- of biblical introduction , -LRB- 2 -RRB- of methods of interpretation , -LRB- 3 -RRB- of the effects of the
Bible	LOCATION	on the lives and literature of great men .

		To one already familiar with the books of the au - thor , this volume contains nothing new .

		Its pages abound with references to his earlier books , and exhibit the same breadth of learning and fullness of culture .

		The style is strikingly Farrarian , and for the most wins the confidence of the reader by the mere force of rhetoric .

		The views presented are in the front ranks of the most progressive churchmen ; in fact , they often overstep the bounds of the pro- gressive conservative school .

		Too much space is wasted in showing the irrationality of positions long ago left in the rear .

		Even '' the allegorical method '' of interpretation now employed by no reputable interpreter covers nearly twenty pages .

		Then farther on in his book -LRB- p. 238 -RRB- , the author himself suggests that the allegorical interpretation of Lot 's actions in the mountain is the most reasonable .

		The '' verbal dictation '' chapter -LRB- p. 104 sq. -RRB- is equally a skeleton of past beliefs . ''

		Plenary inspiration '' -LRB- p. 114 sq. -RRB- is merely a '' general inspiration '' such as inspires Christians to-day .

		The chapter -LRB- XVIII . -RRB-

		on the '' Supremacy of the Bible '' is a collation of the opinions of sixty-five prominent litterateurs , philosophers , scientists , statesmen , generals , and philanthropists , as gathered from their writings on the value of the
Bible	LOCATION	as literature and as a guide to right living .

		The whole book is peculiarly mis - cellaneous to be from the pen of Dean
Farrar	PERSON	.

		It is full of good things , mingled with obsolete and exploded views of other days .

		A CONCORDANCE TO THE GREEK TESTAMENT , according to the Texts of

		Edited by Rev.
W. F. Moulton	PERSON	,
M.A.	LOCATION	,
D.D.	LOCATION	, and Rev.
A. S. Geden	PERSON	,
M. A. New York	LOCATION	:
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		of Old Testament criticism is quickened to action by the accession of such recruits as Professor
Hommel	PERSON	.

		This protest , though uttered in sharp terms , is com - paratively mild .

		The author does not sever his connection with the analyst school , for in the early part of his book he says , in apparent sincerity , '' At the present time , students of the Old Testament are almost unanimous in recognizing the existence of four different main sources '' of the
Pentateuch	LOCATION	, namely , the Priestly code , the Jehovist , the
Elohist	LOCATION	, and the Deuteronomist .

		Also in his treatment of the texts -LRB- e. g. , Gen. 14 -RRB- is reconstructed on a purely subjective basis , with as much positiveness as would be done by any disciple of Wellhausen .

		On the basis of style and language , he conceives that we can separate chapters and parts of chapters and assign them to their proper sources .

		The only noteworthy difference between the radical school and Professor
Hommel	PERSON	lies in the value attached by the latter to Hebrew tradition .

		Our author traverses in the main the field of per - sonal names , and on the philological composition of these attempts to trace the origin of the language , the people , and the religion of old
Babylonia	LOCATION	and Palestine .

		The names in Babylonian , Egyptian , Arabian , and Palestinian documents are analyzed with a distressing amount of detail , such as can be followed out only by an expert in oriental learning .

		These tests precipitate for the author two important facts : -LRB- 1 -RRB- the Arabian origin of the Hammurabi dynasty of
Babylonia	LOCATION	and the Hyksos dynasty in
Egypt	LOCATION	, -LRB- 2 -RRB- the purely mionotheistic character of the early religion of Arabia there being no traces of either Fetishism or Totemism .

		The identifications , though often convincing , are now and then exceed - ingly questionable .

		The palaeographic methods of Professor
Hommel	PERSON	in his earlier works have fore - warned scholars against his frequent phrases , '' ab - solutely proved , '' `` unquestioned , '' etc. , appended sometimes to purely hypothetical cases -LRB- e. g. , p. 39 and 129 , 157 top , 199 bottom , etc. -RRB- .

		The author , too , dashes ahead with conjectures where caution should suggest silence .

		The material is not new , except in a few cases , but has received large atten - tion from archaeologists during the past score of years .

		The endless wrangle over the order and date of dynasties whose discovered remains are as yet mere fragments is next to a waste of time .

		The contested results are at best conjectures , and any scheme based thereon is insecure .

		The position of the author , in antagonizing extremists , is this : the Priest 's Code is preexilic ;
Deuteronomy	LOCATION	was known to
Hosea	LOCATION	, and was not a pious fraud of
Josiah	PERSON	's day ; the law and the account of its origin arose in
Moses	LOCATION	's day ; and the parables of
Balaam	PERSON	and the Song of
Deborah	PERSON	were contemporary documents .

		These conclusions are reached chiefly through the use of personal names .

		The book is almost wholly tech - nical ; it is popularly uninteresting , and of value only to Orientalists .

		It reads almost like a Hebrew lexicon , and will yield its best results in the fields of philology and ethnology .

		There was no gain in translating it into English , for all who can follow THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, the author to profit are acquainted with the German language .

		Mr.
Amos Kidder Fiske	PERSON	, the author of `` The Myths of
Israel	LOCATION	, '' has made his debut too late in history .

		His mythical scheme for Genesis has re - ceived an archaeological blow from which it can never recover .

		Even admitting a documentary ori - gin of the book , there is still enough of archaeolog - ical evidence to drive him from the field .

		Does the monumental testimony set before us within the
past quarter-century	DATE	pass for nothing ?

		For example : he sees simply a legend in the fourteenth chapter of Genesis , '' The picture of Melchisedek is a device for giving an ancient sanctity to Salem , '' etc. .

		But Professors Sayce ,
Hommel	PERSON	, and others could point out on the monuments to Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	the names of the legendary kings here mentioned , as well as con - firmation of some of the facts connected with the description of Melchisedek .

		A disregard of the best and latest results of archaeological research nul - lifies the value of this beautifully printed book .

		Since the appearance of the critical editions of the Greek text of the New Testament by
Tischen	PERSON	- dorf and
Wescott	PERSON	and Hort , scholars have had no up-to-date
Greek Concordance	ORGANIZATION	.

		The great work of
Bruder	PERSON	has served its day with distinction .

		Neither the original work nor the repaired edition of
1888	DATE	has made it what scholars need and demand in order to do the most effective work in
New Testament	LOCATION	lexicography and exegesis .

		The new Concordance , edited by Dr.
W. F. Moulton	PERSON	and the Rev.
A. S. Geden	PERSON	will therefore be welcomed .

		The real author of the book , Mr.
Geden	PERSON	, has done a work monu - mental in character and amount .

		He has embodied in this Concordance all the critical results of three of the best critical editions of the New Testament , namely , Tischendorf -LRB- 8th edition -RRB- ,
Westcott	PERSON	and Hort , and the English Revisers .

		The
Westcott	PERSON	and Hort Greek text has been assumed as the standard , and with it have been compared the other two texts .

		Marginal readings also have in all cases been in - cluded .

		It is thus seen that this work includes all the marginal critical material of three great editions of the
Greek New Testament	ORGANIZATION	.

		These are each indi - cated by appropriate abbreviations .

		Differences of reading are set forth in a line immediately beneath the text concerned , but to avoid unnecessary repeti - tion or useless bulkiness only such variations are noted as affect the form or construction of the word under consideration .

		Care has been exercised to secure in the form of the quotation , as far as pos - sible , grammatical completeness .

		Special usages and constructions are indicated by small prefixed numerals , whose significance is noted at the head of each article .

		Every attempt has been made to re - duce the element of personal preference in these cases to a minimum .

		Abbreviations have been em - ployed in the text only in the case of indeclinable words and of the article .

		Another important fea - ture of the Concordance is that in which the usage of words in the
New Testament	ORGANIZATION	is compared with the Greek of the
Old Testament	ORGANIZATION	and of classical writers .

		These variations are noted by asterisks and a dagger ; and are based , regarding the Sep - tuagint , for the most part upon the new
Oxford Concordance	ORGANIZATION	.

		This , we do not hesitate to say , is the part of the work which must be tested before adoption .

		It opens a field that few scholars are able to enter with any great familiarity , and one in which fewer can put forth decisions of real value .

		Mr.
Geden	PERSON	, however , has done his part cautiously and carefully , and would no doubt claim slight credit for originality in his announced opinions .

		Still one more point adds to the efficiency of this
Concord	LOCATION	- ance as a tool for New Testament workmen . ''

		Of all direct quotations from the Old Testament , the Hebrew text is given immediately beneath the Greek ; occasionally also of passages in which only an indirect or disputed reference is present . ''

		The Hebrew text followed is that of
Baer	PERSON	-LRB- as far as published -RRB- and Theile .

		But a question arises here which will not down , namely : Why cite the Hebrew text of the Old Testament , when the majority of the quotations in the
New Testament	ORGANIZATION	are from the LXX .

		?

		Why would it not have been better to give us the LXX .

		where it agrees with the quotation , or the Hebrew where the same result is apparent , or both where neither exactly agrees ?

		Such a pre - sentation would have materially aided the user of the book , and would have imposed no great burden on the editor .

		The volume is beautifully printed , with but few Greek and Hebrew accents broken off in the presswork .

		Errors are rare compared with the immense care necessary to secure correctness .

		The book is a boon for every biblical scholar who wil1 use it -

		BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS .

		A doubtful French critic of
America	LOCATION	. ''

		America and the Americans from a French Point of View '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is not a very easy book to deal with , for it is full of sharp criticism of Americans and of American life .

		Now , where such criticism is well - founded , the thing to do is to get some good out of it ; and where it is not well-founded , the thing to do is to do nothing .

		But there is always a difficulty in determining whether adverse criticism is well - founded .

		It is always easy for a traveller to pick faults with the life he happens to observe , and travellers are very apt to do so .

		Our reception of a work on
America	LOCATION	is very apt to be influenced by the spirit in which the author observes and the sin - cerity with which he writes , and , it may be added , by the value of the positive suggestions he makes .

		In the present case there are no positive suggestions , so that that matter may be passed over : the author does not affect to be able to rearrange matters and make them better than they are , he merely points out where there are possibilities of improvement .

		Unfortunately , however , it is obvious that the writer got together his material with a mind quite set on
1897	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 119 making the sharpest attack possible .

		It is true , he says a great deal about kindly feeling for
America	LOCATION	, and about the kindly manner in which he was there received .

		We have no doubt that he may have been received with kindness , but there is no reason to suppose that he has any kind feeling in return .

		The tone of the book is , from beginning to end , carping ; now and then it is malicious , now and then it is hypocritically benevolent .

		So one can not think the book the work of an open-minded observer : it is the work of a man on the lookout for flaws .

		Nor is it a sincere book .

		Although said to be the diary of a Frenchman which he wrote for the pleasure of his sister , but which he permits to be translated at the suggestion of two American friends , it seems much more like the original work of an American .

		Without going into particulars , there is a good deal that seems to us inconsistent with the chosen char - acter .

		It seems to us that the author would have done better had he pretended he was a Russian who knew the English language .

		Since it would seem , then , that the book is written by someone who has adopted a silly mask for the pleasure of saying sharp things , it is hard to take just the right atti - tude about it .

		It certainly does note many points about our national life which deserve adverse criti - cism , as , for example , that we are too confident that machinery can do everything ; that we are too devoted to seeming to be busy ; that our politics are not worthy a great republic ; that we have too great admiration for money and material comfort , and so on .

		These criticisms , which we must acknowledge to be well-founded , though not especially new , give the book a sort of value .

		Probably , however , they will not have much more effect on
America	LOCATION	and the Americans than usually attends the efforts of an anonymous fault-finder .

		Dr.
Otto Georg Wetterstrand	PERSON	is a Hypnotism as a o j v. u t. v .

		A curative agent .

		Swedish physician who has intro - duced into the countries of the far north the methods of treating disease by suggestion , which has been so completely and successfully de - veloped in the south , notably in
Paris	LOCATION	and
Nancy	PERSON	.

		His experience with hypnotic suggestion as a thero - peutic agent he has recorded in a volume recently translated into English by Dr.
H. G. Petersen	PERSON	, with the title '' Hypnotism and its Application to Prac - tical Medicine '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		The volume is largely composed of extracts from a physician 's case-book , properly classified and annotated .

		The claims made for this agency are modestly urged , and with no straining to exhibit it as infallible , as supernatural , or as a panacea .

		Like all legitimate forms of treat - ment , it has its successes and failures , is better adapted in some cases than in others , and is based upon well-recognized principles of physiological ac - tion .

		Almost the entire gamut of ills that flesh is heir to is represented in the record of cases successfully treated , from insomnia and neuralgia to paralysis and epilepsy ; from stuttering and neurasthenia to hysteria and blindness ; from anaemia and rheuma - tism to asthma and heart disease , on the whole , an array of evidence which no unprejudiced reader can afford to ignore .

		It is , however , in nervous complaints of functional origin that hypnotic sug - gestion finds its most potent application , acting in other troubles by influencing general conditions of recuperation rather than directly upon the parts affected .

		Dr.
Wetterstrand	PERSON	allows the facts to speak for themselves , and indulges in no theories or strained explanations .

		He is an adherent of the
Nancy	PERSON	school of hypnotism , and thus regards the essential nature of suggestion as a purely psychical process , which the physician should utilize advisedly and judiciously , and not leave to the ill-considered and pernicious manipulations of charlatans .

		The trans - lator has added to the volume a few essays on kin - dred topics , which detract from rather than add to the value of the work .

		His remarks on hypnotism and other topics are mere random observations , furnishing the author an opportunity of gathering about them quasi-philosophical discussions in which the scientific method is conspicuously absent .

		To the art-student and the speculator a?p d on art ' the 8ub 3 ect of Landscape in Poetry is a singularly interesting one .

		There are various ways of looking at the matter .

		The most useful way is to consider how far poetry can deal with landscape and how it does deal with it , to attempt something of the task of
Lessing	PERSON	in the light of a hundred years ' observation of Nature .

		The landscape of the last century , in poetry and in painting , is worth all the landscape in the world , in all preceding centuries .

		So if one wished to talk about something that would really count , one would revise the conclusions of the '' Laokoon '' in the light of Tur - ner and
Monet	ORGANIZATION	on the one hand , and of
Wordsworth	PERSON	and
Tennyson	PERSON	on the other .

		This Mr.
Palgrave	PERSON	has not done in his '' Landscape in Poetry '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		He remarks that `` to trace landscape in colour through its parallel course to landscape in words would be a most interesting study '' ; but he has him - self been content to trace historically the sense of nature in the poetry of the world from Homer down .

		This treatment , we think , rather misconceives the subject .

		Nature in Poetry is one thing ; Landscape in Poetry is another .

		One may conceive of Nature in a philosophic way ; the word Landscape connotes an artistic apprehension .

		And the study of an artistic apprehension necessitates the study of pos - sibilities and methods , and the comparison of dif - ferent arts .

		Mr.
Palgrave	PERSON	attempts to conceive of landscape philosophically ; but when he says '' land - scape '' he means what is commonly called '' nature , '' though in a somewhat restricted sense .

		We can not , however , think it right to call
Wordsworth	PERSON	a `` poet - landscapist , '' when one really means to explain his sense of the `` pre-ordained secret harmony '' be - tween Nature and the heart of man .

		Mr.
Palgrave	PERSON	's view is probably of more general interest to the student of human thought than our own , but our view is the one that is interesting to the artist and 120 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, the lover of poetry as poetry .

		Taking his book for what he meant it to be , however , and not despising it for what it might better have been , it will be found a very good work on the subject .

		It is a little too much of a golden treasury of pictures in poetry , and too often leaves the reader to make his own general - izations .

		Still , the English reader has not anywhere else such a view as is here given , and Mr.
Palgrave	PERSON	's book must be valued accordingly .

		m * ' , antiquity A 8eries of papers , varying greatly in in the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	character and value , upon the Arch -
United	ORGANIZATION	state * .

		geology of the
Eastern United States	ORGANIZATION	, by Mr.
Henry C. Mercer	PERSON	, appear in the publications of the
University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	, with the title '' Researches upon the Antiquity of Man in the
Delaware Valley	LOCATION	and the
Eastern United States	ORGANIZATION	'' -LRB-
Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		In the leading paper Mr.
Mercer	PERSON	investigates the question of the argillite `` turtle - back '' and other rudely-chipped implements which Dr.
Abbott	PERSON	claims to have found in undisturbed glacial gravels .

		He analyzes the material , showing that actual finding in situ is claimed for compara - tively few specimens .

		Mr.
Mercer	PERSON	's own investiga - tions have yielded no truly glacial relics .

		On the other hand , they have brought to light a quarry where argillite was taken out , and a site where it was worked up into form , both plainly modern .

		Mr.
Mercer	PERSON	, while finding no evidence of Quater - nary man in the
Delaware Valley	LOCATION	gravels , does find evidence at one site of two periods of occupancy by early peoples .

		During the older of these , argillite was used almost to the exclusion of chert , jasper , etc. , in the manufacture of implements ; during the later , it is relatively an uncommon material .

		This , though an interesting fact , is not new .

		The other papers in this volume deal with ossuariez , shell - heaps , and cave exploration .

		The material has little general interest , but well deserves record .

		The present interest of
the University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	in archaeology is most fortunate , and may be ex - pected to yield important additions to the science .

		The late Professor
T. H. Green	PERSON	the `` Professor Gray `` of Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	was unquestionably the most influential philosophical thinker of this generation in
England	LOCATION	.

		As an interpreter of certain of the great masters of the past , he pointed out the real nature and the bearing of the problems they were dealing with , and the extent and the grounds alike of their successes and failures , with an insight and skill such as we find in no professed historian of philosophy ; while as a constructive thinker he ranks among the leaders of the idealistic school .

		For these reasons , no student of the subject can afford to neglect his writings ; but as these are by no means easy reading , a connected statement of Professor Green 's views , with the grounds on which they are based , will be of obvious value at least to the begin - ner .

		Such a service Mr.
W. H. Fairbrother	PERSON	has aimed to perform in his volume entitled `` The Philosophy of T. H. Green '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		In a comparatively short space he has given a clear , sys - tematic , and accurate presentation of
Green	ORGANIZATION	's meta - physical , ethical , and political theories .

		Some por - tions of the work , indeed , will hardly be intelligible except when read in the light of the text they are intended to explain .

		But this can not be urged as an objection , since the aim of the book is distinctly stated to be '' to help the younger student to read Green for himself . ''

		This useful mission it is admir - ably adapted to fulfil .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Both amateurs and artists interested in lithography will admire the handsome quarto volume entitled '' Some Masters of Lithography '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- , containing twenty - two representative lithographs reproduced in photogra - ure , with full descriptive text .

		The author , Mr.
Atherton Curtis	PERSON	, has made such selections from the plates of the greatest lithographic artists as would best set forth the resources and the highest achievements of the art , from Senefelder to
Gavarni	LOCATION	.

		The twelve artists whose careers and work are presented include
Ge	ORGANIZATION	` ricault ,
Bonington	LOCATION	,
Isabey	LOCATION	,
Delacroix	LOCATION	,
Daumier	PERSON	, and
Raffet	ORGANIZATION	.

		These critical studies are the results of careful work , which has included the examination of over 15,000 prints at the
Bibliotheque Nationale	ORGANIZATION	; and the plates may be regarded as successful reproductions of the original lithographs .

		A revised and enlarged edition of Mr.
W. J. Hardy	PERSON	's well-known work on '' Book - Plates '' is imported by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		The number of per - sons interested in this subject has largely increased , says Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	, since the work first appeared , in
1893	DATE	; and these will welcome this improved edition , which con - tains considerable additional matter and at least one interesting new plate .

		We glean the curious bit of information that in
America	LOCATION	the taste for book-plates seems to prevail chiefly among lawyers .

		Messrs.
Rand	PERSON	,
McNally & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have published a trans - lation , made by Mrs.
C. A. Kingsbury	PERSON	, of About 's '' The King of the Mountains . ''

		We do not recollect any pre - vious translation , and , if this be indeed the first , it cer - tainly was high time for the work to be done , for in the '' Rod des Montagues '' About is at his best , and the story has a perennial interest , to say nothing of its timeliness just now when the Greeks are getting so much attention .

		The satire of the tale is somewhat extravagant , but events have justified a great deal of it , and there is at least no doubt of the entertaining qualities of the ro - mance .

		LITERARY NOTES .

		Messrs.
T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are to publish an English translation of '' The Pharaoh , '' a remarkable historical novel by Mr.
Boleslaw Prus	PERSON	, a Polish writer .

		Volumes 2 and 3 of the report of the
Venezuelan Boundary Commission	ORGANIZATION	have been issued from the Gov - ernment Printing Office , completing that very thorough , although hardly very valuable , work .

		The '' Examination Bulletin '' for
June	DATE	of the
Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity of the State of
New York	LOCATION	is devoted to the subject of '' College-Entrance English , '' and is a document of great value to all engaged in that department of educa -

		THE DIAL 121 tional work .

		It is edited by Dr.
Richard Jones	PERSON	, and contains articles by a number of competent specialists , as well as a great variety of specimen examination papers sent by colleges all over the country .

		Messrs.
D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have just published three of Mr.
Hamlin Garland	PERSON	's novels in a neat uniform edi - tion .

		The titles are : '' A Spoil of Office , '' '' A Member of the
Third House	ORGANIZATION	, '' and '' Wayside Courtships . ''

		The '' Graduate Courses '' for 1897-98 , just issued by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is the fifth annual publication of that useful work .

		It is both concise and accurate , and wisely conservative in its definition of '' graduate '' work .

		The third volume of Mrs.
Martha Foote Crow	PERSON	's '' Elizabethan Sonnet-Cycles '' contains
Michael Dray	PERSON	- ton 's '' Idea , ''
Bartholomew Griffin	PERSON	's '' Fidessa , '' and

		Cover designed by

$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		For the background of this romantic story the author has chosen a little-worked but extremely interesting time and place ,
New York	LOCATION	in the early
18th century	DATE	, when the manners and customs were part
Datch	PERSON	and part English , with Indians and Frenchmen lurking in the shadows .

		The romance has a new scheme of plot , and hurries on through a series of vivid adventures in the lives of two brothers and the handmaid who is free to serve , but not to plight her troth , till the end of the story .

		A Puritan maid from
New England	LOCATION	lends a piquant contrast to her Dutch relatives , and thus all types of colonial Americans are on the stage .

		The book does not , naturally , detail all sides of the present complex
Harvard	LOCATION	life ; but for the side which it does treat , the typical prosperous , happy side , it does the best thing , tells the truth , and tells it in a most delightful fashion .

		We feel sure that so accurate a picture of modern college life has not yet been drawn , and that all college men will appreciate this and heartily welcome the book .

Boston Courier	ORGANIZATION	.

		Some of the best romantic works of to-day are from the pens of those writers who go to the distant past for their inspiration and ideas .

		Of this class of writers , they are the most successful when historical knowledge enables them to tell a simple tale in which human nature throbs strongly , and not pedantically , amid the glamour of by-gone days , when faith was strong , and life was painted in more glowing tales than it can be to-day .

		Such a story is `` The Falcon of Langeac . ''

		It is more idyllic and sweet in character than a Hope tale ... The spirit of the
Middle Ages	ORGANIZATION	has rarely been better reflected in a story by a modern author .

		LITERARY NOTES .

		161 BOOKS OF THE COMING YEAR .

		The rich and varied list of publications an - nounced for the coming season , which appears in the present number of THE DIAL , com - prises well over a thousand titles , and is the most extensive that we have ever published .

		To call especial attention to a few of these forthcoming books is a somewhat invidious task , except in the case of the small number of those whose appearance has long been await - ed , and which are sure to command a wide circle of interested readers .

		These , at least , may properly be singled out from the mass for special notice , and with them a few others that , either from the standing of their authors or on account of the inherent importance of their subject-matter , seem to deserve a word of at - tention in advance of their publication .

		But there will doubtless be many others , of no less importance , that we shall fail to mention , and the coming months will doubtless bring the usual number of surprises in the shape of im - portant publications that will come to our table unheralded .

		It is not difficult , upon this occasion , to name the work which will unquestionably stand as '' the book of the year . ''

		The biography of Lord
Tennyson	PERSON	, to which the son of the poet has devoted five years of pious toil , will appear on
October 6	DATE	, the anniversary of
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's death .

		It will be a handsomely-illustrated work in two volumes .

		We can not help regret - ting the rather noticeable tendency of publish - ers , during recent years , to produce works of such universal interest as this in so expensive a form as to place them beyond the reach of purchasers with modestly-lined purses .

		The authoritative life of
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	is a work that every reader will wish to possess , but that few will be able to acquire on account of the cost .

		Most book-lovers and literary students will have to go without it until the publishers see fit to prepare a popular edition .

		In this case , and in such others , say , as those of Dr.
Nan	PERSON	- sen 's book ,
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	's letters , and the life of
J. A. Symonds	PERSON	, it seems ill-advised , even from the business standpoint , to produce them in a style that makes necessary a price that is almost prohibitive .

		Another case in point is that of 138 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, the most important book upon
Richard Wag	PERSON	- ner yet produced in English .

		Mr.
H. S. Chamberlain	PERSON	's forthcoming biography of the great composer is a work so necessary for the library of both the musical student and the general reader that many hearts will be made heavy by the price that is set upon it .

		In this case , however , our complaint is perhaps not wholly reasonable , for the value of the work -LRB- as we can testify from inspection of an ad - vance copy -RRB- depends largely upon the illustra - tions , and such plates are expensive things to prepare .

		The book will certainly be cheap at its price , although the fact will hardly console the many who can not afford to place it upon their shelves .

		After naming the above two works of pre - eminent importance , we may call attention to a few others in the department of literary biography , history , and criticism .

		We are promised the life of
Harriet Beecher Stowe	PERSON	, by Mrs.
James T. Fields	PERSON	; the recollections of Mr.
Aubrey de Vere	PERSON	; and a volume upon
Thomas	PERSON	and
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	as educators , by Sir
J. G. Fitch	PERSON	.

		We are also to have , at last , Mr.
Archer	PERSON	's translation of the important Shakes - pearian work of Dr.
Georg Brandes	PERSON	.

		The let - ters of Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	and a second series of letters by
Victor Hugo	PERSON	are among the most in - teresting of our announcements .

		We must also mention Professor
Palgrave	PERSON	's new '' Golden Treasury '' of modern English poetry , Dr.
Skeat	PERSON	's `` Chaucerian and Other Pieces '' -LRB- a volume supplementary to the Oxford Chaucer -RRB- , Professor
Dowden	PERSON	` ja '' French Literature , '' Mr.
David Hannay	PERSON	's volume on '' The Later Re - naissance , '' and President
C. W. Eliot	PERSON	's col - lection of essays and addresses entitled '' Amer - ican Contributions to Civilization . ''

		Mr.
Mosher	PERSON	's charming reprints will appear , as heretofore , just before
Christmas	DATE	, and will add ten choice numbers to his catalogue .

		In the domain of pure literature , mention must first be made of '' The Water of the Wondrous Isles , '' one of the two romances left by
William Morris	PERSON	for posthumous publica - tion .

		No announcement of the other , '' The Sundering Flood , '' is made as yet .

		American song will be worthily represented by Mr.
E. C. Stedman	PERSON	's '' Poems Now First Collected . ''

		The output of fiction promises to be of great and varied interest .

		Among the more import - ant titles are the following : '' St.
Ives	PERSON	, '' by
R. L. Stevenson	PERSON	; '' Light Shineth Through the Darkness , '' by Mr.
Henryk Sienkiewicz	PERSON	; * ' Captains Courageous , '' by Mr.
Rudyard Kip	PERSON	- ling ; ''
Hugh Wynne	PERSON	, Free Quaker , '' by Dr.
S. Weir Mitchell	PERSON	; `` The Days of
Jeanne d'Arc	PERSON	, '' by Mrs.
M. H. Catherwood	PERSON	; '' Cor - leone , '' by Mr.
Marion Crawford	PERSON	; ''
Paris	LOCATION	, '' by
M. Zola	PERSON	-LRB- completing the trilogy of
Lourdes	LOCATION	,
Rome	LOCATION	,
Paris	LOCATION	-RRB- ; ''
Dariel	PERSON	, A Romance of Sur - rey , '' by Mr.
R. D. Blackmore	PERSON	; '' The Jug - gler , '' by Miss
Mary N. Murfree	PERSON	; '' The Story of an Untold Love , '' by Mr.
Paul Leicester Ford	PERSON	; and '' Three Partners ; or , The Big Strike on Heavy-Tree Hill , '' by Mr.
Bret Harte	PERSON	.

		From the numerous titles belonging to books of the more solid and erudite classes we hardly know what to choose .

		In history , there are , besides some important continua - tions , such works as '' Old
Virginia	LOCATION	and Her Neighbors , '' by Professor
John Fiske	PERSON	; '' The Westward Movement , '' by Mr.
Justin Win	PERSON	- sor ; ''
France	LOCATION	under
Louis XV.	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
James Breck Perkins	PERSON	; '' The Evolution of the Aryan , '' by
Rudolph von Ihering	PERSON	; and `` Sea Power and the Future of the
United States	LOCATION	, '' by Captain
A. T. Mahan	PERSON	.

		There is to be a sumptuous illustrated translation of
Pausanias	LOCATION	, and several volumes in an import - ant series of '' Handbooks of Archaeology and Antiquities . '' ''

		The English Stage , '' by the acute and ingenious French critic ,
M. Augus	PERSON	- tin Filon , will be a very interesting book . ''

		The
Meaning of Education	ORGANIZATION	, and Other Es - says , '' by Dr.
Nicholas Murray Butler	PERSON	, will deserve and get the attention of all educators .

		Mr.
Oscar Fay Adams	PERSON	's '' Dictionary of Am - erican Authors , '' an entirely new work , will be a valuable aid to the bibliographer , as will also the third supplement -LRB- 1892-96 inclusive -RRB- to
Poole	PERSON	's '' Index to Periodical Literature . ''

		IN A VOLUME OF LOWELL 'S LETTERS .

		Lowell , I never met thee while on earth ; Yet thou so livest in these words of thine That thy rich nature friendly seemeth mine While musing on their golden-freighted worth In these thou speakest , and my heart 's deep dearth Is springing with sweet flowers , and new wine Of
Cyprus	LOCATION	gladdens , while o'erhead entwine Leafy traceries ` gainst the blue ; and mirth Draws smiles that soften into deeper look , As closer breathes thy soul 's most dear aspiring For life beloved and finely truthful art .

		Thou yearnedst after love : grateful I took The hand thou openedst here , silent desiring Thou knewest the winning of thy reader 's heart .


FREDERIC L. LUQUEER	PERSON	.

		1897 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 139 WHAT IS `` AMERICAN STYLE '' ?

		In attempting dispassionately to analyze our lit - erary characteristics , we are met at the threshold by a difficult and fundamental question What is style ?

		Style is as difficult to define as it is easy to recognize ; but only by getting a conception of it , at least approximately clear , can we intelligently dis - cuss a distinctively national style .

		And first let us see what it is not .

		Style is fre - quently confused , to a degree at least , with subject - matter ; for example , it is thought that
Whittier	LOCATION	, having written much concerning the subject of Slavery , would therefore possess a distinctively American style .

		Such an opinion , however , is too easily susceptible of a reductio ad absurdum to be tenable .

		Keats 's fruitless attempt to enter into the spirit of the majestic Greek myths ;
Corneille	ORGANIZATION	's in - ability to put into the mouth of
Horace	PERSON	or his two brothers other than XVII .

		century Frenchisms , and other examples innumerable , demonstrate the im - possibility of reproducing the style of an author or a period by mere skilful use of subject-matter .

		It is true that subject-matter , in proportion as it is trivial or ennobling , weakens or elevates the style ; but , in jest or earnest , the same distinctive qualities inhere .

		Nor is style dialect a proposition by no means so self-evident as the first .

		For we are accustomed to determine a writer 's style , more or less , by his phraseology and trick of expression ; not only by his accustomed sequence of words , but by his methods of constructing the words themselves ; that is , by his '' form of language , '' or dialect .

		But dia - lect is , essentially , local spoken language or patois ; written dialect being therefore only an attempt to reproduce that external form , the shell , rather than its internal essence , or kernel .

		This kernel , the true style , is what we are seeking to examine .

		There - fore , to say that the '' Yankeeisms '' of
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	's `` Biglow Papers , '' or the military jargon of
Kip	PERSON	- ling 's soldier-ballads , constitutes the one American or the other English national style , is to stigmatize our language as vulgar and ridiculous .

		It is true that the ideal style is said to be `` the speech of the people in the mouth of the scholar , '' but it must be the rough pig-iron of the people 's speech worked into the tempered steel of the schol - ar 's pen , not pedantic but symmetrically simple .

		Mr.
Brander Matthews	PERSON	struck the key-note when he called this `` the wild flowers of speech plucked betimes with the dew still on them . ''

		But if style is neither matter nor dialect , is it then grammar and rhetoric ?

		Plainly not ; a man may be minutely accurate in grammar , and struc - turally perfect in phrase , yet lack the individuality of thought and facility of expression which stamp the hall-mark of '' self '' upon every sentence of an
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	or a
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	.

		Clearly , then , we must go deeper than matter or dialect , grammar or rhetoric , down to the man himself . ''

		Le style , c'est 1 ` homme , '' said
Buffon	PERSON	.

		This definition , so terse , so strik - ing , so famous , is , like most epigrams , the truth , but not the whole truth .

		If by the man we mean the character of the man , and what else could we mean ?

		character and style are not always in ac - cord .

		The gross sensuality sometimes displayed by
Poe	PERSON	, the man , is strangely out of tune with the refined delicacy of `` Anabel Lee . ''

		The weakness and immorality of
Jean Jacques Rousseau	PERSON	, the man , make the subtle eloquence of
Jean Jacques Rous	PERSON	- seau , the author , hard to explain .

		A man 's style is frequently not what he is , but what he thinks he is .

		He may reverse
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	's description , and by a sparkling goblet of imagination , become temporarily a Dr.
Jekyl	PERSON	in what he writes , but in character be still Mr.
Hyde	PERSON	.

		Nor are thoughts ever the '' self '' alone . ''

		Ideas can not go about naked , '' said
Bui	PERSON	veer
Lytton	LOCATION	.

		They must wear the apparel of the national clothing - house , so to speak , the garments of Race , Sur - roundings , and Epoch .

		It is evident , then , that style is the man , yet more than the man ; it is the dynamic of the ma - chine , whose parts are the material characteristics into which language can be analyzed .

		From another point of view ,
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	defines it charmingly , but in a fashion too poetic to be scien - tifically exact , as `` that exquisite something called Style , which makes itself felt by the skill with which it effaces itself , and masters us at last with a sense of indefinable completeness . ''

		Having attempted to reach some comprehension of what style is , viewed from the standpoint of the scientist and of the poet , we are next led to inquire what , if there be such a thing , is a national style ?

		This has been defined as `` an average style de - duced from the examination of many or most of a nation 's authors '' ; but such a definition is super - ficial .

		If a style is personal , it partakes of the character of the person , as evidenced in his daily life .

		If a style is national , it partakes of the character of the nation as evidenced in its daily life .

		In other words , it is not the '' average of the best styles '' which constitutes a national style , but it is rather the style of those who , be they great or small , most truly voice the national character .

		There is as much individuality in a nation as there is in an individual .

		If we can analyze these national characteristics , and , taking them as a test , try the writers of a nation by them , we shall arrive thus , and only thus , at a true conception of the lit - erary style of that nation .

		Let us take the French as an example .

		For a just , even though a French , analysis of their psy - chological process , let us turn to
Taine	PERSON	: `` When the Frenchman conceives an event or an object , he conceives quickly and distinctly .

		... At once and without effort he seizes upon his idea .

		But he seizes that alone .

		... He is only moved super - ficially ; he is without large sympathy ; he does not perceive an object as it is , complex and combined , but in part , with a discursive and superficial knowl - The style that could be called `` distinctively 140 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, French '' would be , speaking broadly , that possess - ing the characteristics described above .

		So , in solving the problem of a distinctively American style , we would first ask ourselves whether there is a distinctively American charac - ter , and if so what are its essentials .

		That there is , universal opinion attests .

		From
England	LOCATION	to
Japan	LOCATION	, from
Norway	LOCATION	to the
Cape of Good Hope	LOCATION	, none is so easily recognizable as the American type .

		Though Englishmen , at least sensible Englishmen , have ceased to expect the typical American to pass his waking hours and , for that matter , most of his sleeping hours with trousers in boots and pistols in belt ,
Jonathan	PERSON	has still every whit as much individuality as
John	PERSON	.

		What are the forces whose resultant is this indi - viduality ?

		In so far as I can analyze them , they are : 1 .

		The youthf ulness of the national life .

		From this youthfulness comes , naturally enough , a cer - tain intensity and rush of life , characteristic of all youth , which tends to make us lacking in precision , careless of detail , somewhat superficial in reasoning , quick to grasp but weak to hold .

		2 .

		Democracy .

		Our intensely democratic feel - ing engenders self-respect and self-sufficiency ; a breadth , though not a depth , of view ; independ - ence and disrespect for old institutions ; and a lack of that conservatism which should subordinate the warm heart to the cool head .

		3 .

		Heterogeneity .

		We are a hybrid nation , | and though pride of birth is sometimes a correcting and restraining influence , the consciousness of our some - what hazy lineage tends to destroy prejudice and render us cosmopolitan and broad .

		4 .

		Natural variety .

		No other people on the face of the globe can see greater contrasts of scenery , greater extremes of climate , or greater varieties of products , than those who dwell between the
Great Lakes	ORGANIZATION	and the
Rio Grande	LOCATION	, the
Atlantic	LOCATION	and the
Pacific	LOCATION	oceans .

		This engenders a bold , free , broad conception of nature , an intense appreciation of her various moods , and an expression of those moods excelling that of any other nation in its un - trammelled artlessness .

		Here , nature is young , as well as we ; sometimes she is stately and grand , with all the self-conscious dignity of young womanhood ; sometimes she is impetuous , effervescent , sparkling , and free , with the memory of her childhood , un - touched by human artificiality , still vivid ; but in whatever mood she be , we have had and still have poets to appreciate and express her .

		These , then , are the forces , these the effects , observable in our national character .

		If there be any other nation having these same characteristics , and writers to express them , distinctively American style is an impossibility .

		But it needs no argu - ment to show that no other nation is the resultant of such forces in such proportions .

		Wherever , there - fore , we can find within our borders prose or poetry having such characteristics as have been enumerated , we shall have found a distinctively American style .

		SOME QUESTIONS OF GERMAN TRANSLATION .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THB DIAL . -RRB-

		In your issue of
July 16	DATE	, Mr.
Thomas Common	PERSON	of
Glasgow	LOCATION	, whose translation of
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's Works I re - viewed in an earlier issue , claims that my criticism of his translation is altogether unfair ; that I dealt out my blame of it '' in a great hurry '' ; that the errors I adduce are no errors at all '' except in the imagination of a per - son in a flurried state of mind . ''

		It hence becomes my unpleasant duty to show why I was bound to regard this translation as '' bad throughout , and in parts igno - minious . ''

		First , as regards the four errors I quoted .

		I , for one , am offended by a construction like '' in his art there is mixed ... the things , '' etc. .

		I am , however , willing to yield to higher authority , aud admit that on that point I was over-severe .

		But to translate '' Die
Romane Dos	PERSON	- toiewsky 's '' -LRB- Vol .

		VIII. , p. 48 of the German edition -RRB- by `` the romances of Dostoiewsky '' shows a lack of linguistic sensitiveness .

		Dostoiewsky 's works are not romances , they are distinctly novels .

		No one ever spoke of Flaubert 's '' Madame Borary '' or Zola 's '' La Terre '' as '' romances , '' though he might apply that term to '' Guy Mannering '' or to Me ` rime'e 's '' Colomba . ''

		Similarly , to translate sick verbieten '' -LRB- p. 38 -RRB- by '' pro- hibit oneself '' is awkward .

		All these translations are , however , excusable compared with Mr.
Common	PERSON	's ren - dering of '' ich weiss nicht aus noch ein '' -LRB- p. 217 -RRB- by '' I do not know out or in . ''

		Mr. Common naively calls this '' a metaphor , '' and says : '' I am blamed for preserving a metaphor by translating it literally , though not ob - scurely .

		Besides preserving the metaphor , the literal rendering seems best suited to the context . '' ''

		Ich weiss nicht aus noch ein '' is an idiomatic phrase which every German understands . ''

		I know not out or in '' is no English at all , and is totally unintelligible .

		These last three passages are , however , not the only ones open to criticism .

		The book is freckled with bits of bad translation .

		I subjoin a list , which , for lack of space , can not lay claim to completeness .

		Page 61 .

		`` I have my readers everywhere ... / have not them in

		These samples of Mr.
Common	PERSON	's method of transla - tion will suffice to show that he must have worked care - lessly and in haste , and that he lacks literary sense .

		Furthermore , he seems not sufficiently to master German to understand thoroughly idiomatic constructions .

		A JAPANESE MAGAZINE OF FOREIGN LANGUAGES .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I beg leave to call your attention to one more manifestation of the broad spirit which now prevails in this empire with reference to the necessity of a better knowledge of foreign things .

		Another magazine has just been launched on the crowded sea of journalism ; it is called ''
Gwaikoku Gogaku Zasshi	PERSON	, '' or '' Foreign Language Magazine . ''

		Its object is to assist students to acquire English , French , German , Italian , Spanish , Russian , Chinese , and Korean .

		The first number con - tains exactly 200 pages in the body of the work ; the table of contents , printed in each of these languages , occupies eight pages ; and there are several pages of advertisements in both Japanese and English .

		It is published by the Hakubunkwan ,
Tokyo	LOCATION	, and sells at 25 sen a copy , or
2.70 yen	MONEY	per year .

		The first edition of 6,000 was exhausted at once ; and a second edition is in print .

		A cursory examination of the English portion reveals comparatively few mistakes or misprints , and indicates that , in general , the work has been well done .

		The English section takes up more than half the issue ; the German section occupies one-fifth ; the French section not quite one-tenth ; the Russian , Italian and Spanish sections four pages each ; and the Chinese and Korean sections six pages each .

		The con - tents include lessons , conversations , letters , news items , current events , extracts from literature , essays , poems , etc. .

		Each language is taught under such headings as the following : '' Pronunciation , conversation , gram - mar , composition , translation , reading matter , current notes , etc. '' There are also illustrations , including one of Queen
Victoria	PERSON	.

		The editor-in-chief is Mr.
S. Ohashi	PERSON	, who is assisted in each department by a special - ist -LRB- a Japanese -RRB- in that language .

		The Spanish sec - tion , however , is under the supervision of Prof.
Emilio Binda	PERSON	.

		The publisher 's note speaks of '' the import - ance to our people of all these languages , whether considered from political , educational , commercial , or any other point of view '' ; and also says that , '' as mixed residence will soon be a matter of reality , '' '' the study of foreign languages is , therefore , of urgent necessity .

		THE LACK OF SCIENTIFIC WORK IN RHETORIC .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The inadequacy of recent books on rhetoric , and the generally feeble and unscientific way in which the sub - ject is at present taught in our schools and colleges , seem to me to call for comment and for protest .

		If we may judge from their writings , many authors of text-books on this subject neither conceive the pos - sibility nor appreciate the desirability of a Rhetoric having its basis in definitely known psychological principles , studies of development of language power in race and individual , and in perfected methods of investigation .

		The science of rhetoric is fifty to a hundred years behind economics and psychology , and in many respects its present condition is like the ear - lier stages of these and other sciences .

		The work of each writer is generally unadvantageously individ - ual in some respects each author usually attempt - ing to cover the whole field of the subject .

		There also is much less division of labor and intelligent co - operation than in a highly developed science .

		Such is the necessary result of the comparative absence of scien - tific methods methods capable of being accurately described and criticised , thus rendering the results verifiable and making it possible rationally to estimate their value .

		The broader generalizations from which each author makes his deductions , as in the abstract economics and the old psychology , are reached by pro- cesses of which the authors themselves are not clearly conscious .

		Although philology , sociology , and psycho - logy stand ready to make contributions of methods and conclusions , students of rhetoric have been much slower than students of more progressive sciences to avail them - selves of such aid .

		How many college text-books treat general principles at all adequately ?

		In how many pop - ular texts do we find expositions of the real nature of language power , its relation to mental development and to ultimate aims in life , and of its value to human society ?

		The broader ethical , aesthetic , and social im - ports of the power of verbal expression are generally ignored .

		An occasional reference to commercial utility , and appeals to class pride or ambition , are frequently the only references to any rational aim in the science .

		Notwithstanding various merits of some recent works , and that some are in part to be excepted from these criticisms , there is a very real need of a science of rhetoric employing the methods of modern sciences .

		This way she passed , for at the crossing see A messenger , new come from

		A PENDANT TO BOSWEL.L , .

		* In the preface to his edition of the '' Letters of
Samuel Johnson	PERSON	'' Dr.
George Birkbeck Hill	PERSON	expresses the hope that he may live to complete the main work of his life as a scholar by a new edition of the '' Lives of the Poets . ''

		From this projected task he has been turned aside , temporarily , as we trust , by a suggestion from Mr ,
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	to edit all those writ - ings which have long been included under the general title of '' Johnsoniana . ''

		The fruit of Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	's happy proposal now lies before us two beautiful volumes , at all points such as the nice judgment of their lamented pro- moter would have approved of , elucidated and enriched editorially as only Dr.
Birkbeck Hill	PERSON	could have done it .

		The work contains nearly everything worth reading -LRB- outside of
Boswell	PERSON	-RRB- that has been written about , or that is trust - worthily recorded as having been said about , the
Sage of Bolt Court	ORGANIZATION	by people who knew him in life , besides certain matter of an auto - biographical character or interest from the hand of the great man himself .

		Dr.
Hill	PERSON	has not , of course , been able to offer much that is new or even tolerably unfamiliar in the way of
Johnsonian	DATE	lore ; but he has put the old in the best possible shape for reading or for reference .

		The main omission is Madame D'Arblay 's '' Diary , '' from which he had at first thought of giving extracts , but which , he concluded after reflection , '' is too good a piece of work to be hacked in pieces . ''

		Readers , therefore , who would fain know `` gay

		Some slight additions have been made to the hitherto general stock of Johnsoniana .

		By collating the text of '' Prayers and Meditations , '' with the original manuscript preserved at

Hill	PERSON	has been enabled to make some corrections and to supply some omissions .

		To the rich collection of ``

Robert B. Adam	PERSON	, of
Buffalo	LOCATION	,
N. Y.	PERSON	, Dr. Hill warmly expresses his indebtedness .

		Several hitherto unpublished letters to and from Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	are added through the kindness of the owners of the originals .

		* Dr.
Hill	PERSON	's opening volume is devoted to the longer pieces , including the `` Prayers and Meditations , '' printed with
George Strahan	PERSON	's Preface to his first edition , of
1785	DATE	; Dr.
John	PERSON	- son 's '' Annals '' of his life up to his eleventh year ; Mrs.
Piozzi	PERSON	's '' Anecdotes '' ; and
Arthur Murphy	PERSON	's '' Essays on
Johnson	PERSON	's Life and Genius . ''

		Volume II .

		forms a rich storehouse of Johnsonian miscellany .

		There is a great array of '' Anecdotes , '' and a collection of let - ters most of which are now printed for the first time ; there are Apophthegms from
Hawkins	PERSON	's edition of
Johnson	LOCATION	, Extracts from
Boswell	ORGANIZATION	's Letters to
Malone	PERSON	, and the '' Recollections '' of
Miss Reynolds	LOCATION	; there are
Hoole	PERSON	's and Wind - ham 's narratives of
Johnson	ORGANIZATION	's closing days ; there is the Biographical Sketch by
Tyers	PERSON	; there are two papers by
Reynolds	PERSON	, on
Johnson	PERSON	's '' Character '' and on his '' Influence , '' together with the genial painter 's two capital '' Dia - logues in Imitation of
Johnson	ORGANIZATION	's Style of Con - versation . ''

		Among the letters given we note an interesting one -LRB- from the collection of Mr.
Adam	PERSON	-RRB- setting forth Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	's views on literary property .

		It is dated
March 7 , 1774	DATE	, and was written , as Dr.
Hill	PERSON	surmises , to
William Strahan	PERSON	. ''

		SIR : I will tell you in a few words , what is , in my opinion , the most desirable state of Copyright or literary Property .

		The
Authour	PERSON	has a natural and peculiar right to the profits of his own work .

		But as every Man who claims the protection of Society , must purchase it by resigning some part of his natural right , the authour must recede from so much of his claim as shall be deemed injurious or inconvenient to Society .

		It is incon - venient to Society that an useful book should become perpetual and exclusive property .

		The Judgement of the Lords f was therefore legally and politically right .

		But the authour 's enjoyment of his natural right might * Messrs.

		1897 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 143 without any inconvenience be protracted beyond the term settled by the Statute .

		And it is , I think , to be desired -LRB- 1 -RRB- That an Authour should retain during his life the sole right of printing and selling his work .

		This is agreeable to moral right , and not inconvenient to the publick , for who will be so diligent as the authour to improve the book , and who can know so well how to improve it ?

		-LRB- 2 -RRB- That the authour be allowed , as by the present act -LSB- 8th of Queen
Anne -RSB-	PERSON	, to alienate his right only for fourteen years .

		A shorter time would not procure a sufficient price , and a longer would cut off all hope of future profit , and consequently all solici - tude for correction or addition .

		-LRB- 3 -RRB- That when after fourteen years the copy shall revert to the authour , he be allowed to alienate it again only for seven years at a time .

		After fourteen years the value of the work will be known , and it will be no longer bought at hazard .

		Seven years of possession will therefore have an assign - able price .

		It is proper that the authour be always incited to polish and improve his work , by that prospect of accruing interest which those shorter periods of alien - ation will afford .

		-LRB- 4 -RRB- That after the authour 's death his work should continue an exclusive property capable of bequest and inheritance , and of conveyance by gift or sale for thirty years .

		By these regulations a book may continue the property of the authour , or of those who claim from him , about fifty years , a term sufficient to reward the writer without any loss to the publick .

		In fifty years far the greater number of books are forgotten and annihilated , and it is for the advantage of learning that those which fifty years have not destroyed should become bona communia , to be used by every Scholar as he shall think best .

		In fifty years every book begins to require notes either to explain forgotten allusions and obsolete words ; or to subjoin those discoveries which have been made by the gradual advancement of knowl - edge ; or to correct those mistakes which time may have discovered .

		Such Notes can not be written to any useful purpose without the text , and the text will frequently be refused while it is any man 's property . ''

		One of the more unfamiliar anecdotes , tell - ing of an amusing rencontre between the Doctor and
Gilbert Stuart	PERSON	, the American painter , at that time studying under Benjamin West , is taken from
Stuart	PERSON	's '' History of the Rise of the Arts of Design in the
United States	LOCATION	. '' ''

		Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	called one morning on Mr.
West	PERSON	to converse with him on American affairs .

		After some time Mr.
West	PERSON	said that he had a young American -LRB-
Gilbert Stuart	PERSON	-RRB- living with him , from whom he might derive some information , and introduced
Stuart	PERSON	.

		The conver - sation continued -LRB-
Stuart	PERSON	being thus invited to take a part in it -RRB- , when the Doctor observed to Mr.
West	PERSON	that the young man spoke very good English ; and turning to
Stuart	PERSON	rudely asked him where he had learned it .

		Stuart very promptly replied , Sir , I can better tell you where I did not learn it it was not from your diction - ary . '

		Johnson seemed aware of his own abruptness , and was not offended . ''

		Dr.
Birkbeck Hill	PERSON	has , as usual , enriched his margins with a mass of notes that are often as good reading as the text and rarely fail to requite the added bulk of volume they entail .

		His encyclopaedic knowledge of his theme is mated with a faculty of anticipating reasonable doubts and queries and an honest zeal to clear the path of the reader .

		The work is a rarely rich and diversified one a book of intensest human interest , that one opens at random with the assurance that the eye will be caught and the attention fixed by some word , wise or witty or vividly pictorial .

		For all considerable libra - ries , it forms the indispensable pendant to
Boswell	ORGANIZATION	's indispensable book .

		THE LITERARY HISTORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION .

		* In the work that he originally entitled '' The History of American Literature , '' Professor
Moses Coit Tyler	PERSON	undertook '' to examine the entire mass of American writings during the Colonial period so far as they now exist in the public and private libraries of the country , '' even to the extent of '' making an appropriate mention of every one of our early authors whose writings , whether many or few , have any appre - ciable literary merit , or throw any helpful light upon the evolution of thought and style during those flourishing and indispensable days '' ; and to present all the valuable fruits of his exami - nation in such literary form as would commend them to the public favor .

		How well he succeeded in this arduous undertaking is shown by the place that the work has steadily held during the almost score of years that have elapsed since its publication .

		Professor
Tyler	PERSON	, how - ever , did not abandon the child of his study at its birth , but has continued to watch over it , remedying its defects as he discovered them or they were pointed out to him , until he has now presented us with a revised and improved edi - tion , bearing a title somewhat changed .

		But , what is more to our present purpose , he also gives us the first volume of a new work , or perhaps it would be better to say an extension of the old one ; for his original scheme , as he first described it , embraced `` the history of American literature from the earliest English settlements in this country down to the present time .

		144 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, which never lived to complete it ; but we may hope that to Professor
Tyler	PERSON	will be accorded a happier lot .

		In '' The Literary History of the American Revolution '' Professor
Tyler	PERSON	attempts a thing before unattempted , so far as we are aware , to say nothing of performance .

		It will be well to let him state the case in his own words : '' There would , perhaps , be no injustice in describing this book as the product of a new method , at least of a method never before so fully applied in the critical treatment of the
American Revolution	ORGANIZATION	.

		The outward history of that famous procedure has been many times written , and is now , by a new breed of American scholars , being freshly rewritten in the light of larger evidence , and under the direction of a more disinterested and a more judicial spirit .

		In the present work , for the first time in a systematic and a fairly complete way , is set forth the inward history of our Revolution the his - tory of its ideas , its spiritual moods , its motives , its pas - sions , even of its sportive caprices and its whims , as these uttered themselves at the time , whether con - sciously or not , in the various writings of the two parties of Americans who promoted or resisted that great movement . ''

		The plan of the author has been to let both parties in the controversy the Whigs and the
Tories	ORGANIZATION	, the Revolutionists and the Loyalists tell their own story freely in their own way , and without either of them being liable , at our hands , to posthumous outrage in the shape of partisan imputations on their sincerity , their magnanimity , their patriotism , or their courage .

		More - over , for the purpose of historic interpretation , the au - thor has recognized the value of the lighter , as well as of the graver , forms of literature , and consequently has here given full room to the lyrical , the humorous , and the satirical aspects of our Revolutionary record its songs , ballads , sarcasms , its literary facetice .

		The entire body of American writings , from
1763	DATE	to
1783	DATE	, whether serious or mirthful , in prose or in verse , is here deline - ated in its most characteristic examples , for the purpose of exhibiting the several stages of thought and emotion through which the American people passed during the two decades of the struggle which resulted in our na - tional Independence . ''

		The older writers dealt almost wholly with the political and military aspects of the Revolu - tion ; some of the younger ones have widened the view , taking in economical , social , and other factors ; but it remained for Professor Tyler to conceive and execute a work that is exclusively devoted to the subjective or spiritual factors of the period as they are expressed in literature .

		Professor
Tyler	PERSON	first teaches us to '' distin - guish between those writings which were the re - sult of certain general intellectual interests and tendencies , apart from the Revolutionary move - ment ; and , secondly , those writings which were the result of intellectual interests and activities directly awakened and sustained by that move - ment . ''

		The writings of the second class , which give the period its character , he divides as fol - lows : Correspondence ,
State	ORGANIZATION	papers , oral ad - dresses , secular and sacred , political essays , political satires in verse , popular lyric poetry , minor literary facetice , dramatic compositions , prose narratives of actual experiences , indi - vidual or collective .

		This classification , how - ever , does not impose upon him his method of treatment , for he chiefly holds to historical se - quence , the very '' order of time whenever they severally came into life , and wrought their work in the world , thus permitting the principal members of those different groups of literature to appear upon these pages and to unfold their message to us somewhat as they actually made their first appearance in the successive scenes of that great transaction in which they were so significant a part . ''

		Again , his purpose is not so much to call attention to the independent artistic value of these writings as to their hu - manistic and historic value .

		These are the main lines of the work , and surely it is necessary only to draw them to indi - cate at least the great value of a well-educated work that should follow them out .

		Professor
Tyler	PERSON	has given us the first volume of such a work , in more than five hundred pages , with a promise of a companion volume that shall bring the story down to the close of the war .

		The new work has the qualities of the earlier one : thorough research , judicious handling of materials , and a clear , vigorous , pleasing style , dashed with plenty of the writer 's personality .

		As in the earlier work , it is not always easy to see in a writer or in a writing all that Professor
Tyler	PERSON	sees in it .

		But this fact gives us no offence .

		This is a case where an author is not only permitted but expected to imitate the good bishop in magnifying his office .

		In other words , an enthusiasm born of the/acA is required in order to see and write the history of American literature down to
1783	DATE	as large as Professor
Tyler	PERSON	sees and writes it .

		The work offers many interesting points for discussion , and we shall draw attention to one of them .

		It does full justice to the Loyalists , both in the amount of space that is devoted to them five full chapters , to say nothing of frequent occasional mention , and in the view that is taken of their attitude toward the great questions of the period .

		At the close of one of these chapters the writer corrects what he calls '' three grave errors closely connected with the whole subject , and still prevalent in popular American expositions of it . ''

		These errors are -LRB- 1 -RRB- '' to represent the Tories of the American Revolution as a party of mere negation and
1897	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 145 obstruction '' ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- to represent them '' as a party opposed either to any reform in the rela - tions of the colonies with the mother country , or to the extension of human rights and liber - ties here or elsewhere '' ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- to represent them '' as composed of Americans lacking in love for their native country , or in zeal for its liberty , or in unwillingness to labor or fight , or even to die , for what they conceived to be its inter - ests . ''

		While it is impossible for any man holding the traditionary view to accept this criticism , historical investigation is neverthe - less leading us to it slowly but irresistibly .

		Professor
Tyler	PERSON	goes so far , as we understand him , as to yield the old contention that the course pursued by the British Parliament in taxing
America	LOCATION	contravened the ancient prin - ciple of no taxation without representation .

		At the same time , we understand him to be a good American patriot and a believer in the Amer - ican Revolution .

		What is by no means uni - versal now among American scholars and his - torians , he maintains that the two central charges of the Declaration of Independence were true , namely , that the ministerial policy , which was the royal policy , evinced a design to reduce the Americans under absolute despot - ism , and had as its direct object the establish - ment of an absolute tyranny over them .

		In fact , his view of the Declaration is altogether more enthusiastic than the one we sometimes find American historical scholars upholding .

		How , then , does Professor
Tyler	PERSON	reconcile his high estimate both of the Loyalists and of
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	?

		This question brings us to what we consider , logically speaking , the greatest defect of the book .

		This is the failure anywhere to present , so far as we have observed , a consistent general statement of the author 's own theory of the Revolution .

		No doubt he has such a theory .

		Perhaps , too , the well-read student will be able to extract this theory from scattered passages in the volume ; but this student should not have been put to this labor , or the less well - equipped reader exposed to the hazard of mis - conceiving the author 's meaning , as is now the case .

		Perhaps Professor
Tyler	PERSON	holds in reserve a statement of the lines of argument on which he vindicates the Revolution .

		We sincerely hope such is the case .

		In one view , the
American Revolution	ORGANIZATION	was one of the tragedies of history .

		As though it were not enough to put asunder two peoples of a common origin that had many reasons for working out their destiny together , it ruthlessly divided the younger of these peoples into two not very unequal and altogether implacable factions , ending in the complete suppression or extirpation of the weaker one .

		When one witnesses the qualities of mind , culture , and character that the American Loyalists show in Professor
Tyler	PERSON	's History , and contemplates the prosperous communities they established in the great nation to the north of us , he recalls the curse that
William of Orange	ORGANIZATION	, as he beheld in battle the splendid valor of the Irish regiments in the French army , pronounced upon the cruel fate that had denied to him the services of such soldiers .

		B A
HINSDALE	LOCATION	.

		NOTHING BUT LEAVES .

		* '' Patrins '' are bunches of leaves by which Miss
Guiney	PERSON	shows the path she has taken .

		On the whole , however , it is a pity that she should not have marked her path with great sign - boards , so that it might be avoided .

		It is a dangerous path : Miss
Guiney	PERSON	may have trod - den it in safety , but there have been many and there will be many who have tried to follow it without success .

		To speak directly , we dissent from the attitude in life commended by
Miss Guiney	LOCATION	.

		For instance , the scholar , to her mind , is one who knows already all he wants to , and goes about smilingly diffusing the scorn of education , '' conversing consumedly about the weather '' ; the '' out-of-doorling '' does not do anything while he is out-of-doors , but '' simply moves or sits in eternal amalgamation with the eternal . ''

		Now , though everyone knows that there is some sense in the attitude which
Miss Guiney	LOCATION	has in mind , it must also be plain that for one who can attain a sensible state to be humorously described as above , there will be a thousand Miss Nancies ,
Willieboys	LOCATION	, and absolutely imbecile chumps , who are rejoiced at such an opportunity for mere blatant assumption .

		And these nonenti - ties , who hope that they will be thought some - thing of by dint of doing nothing , are an awful bore of which we have already too many . ''

		The oddest and choicest of social attitudes , '' says
Miss Guiney	PERSON	, is an attitude of sacred indifference .

		It is true you must n't fall into anything so foolish as the '' cheap indifferentism so called ; the sickness of sophomores '' : you must be something more distinguished , something like
Lucius Gary	PERSON	,
Viscount Falkland	PERSON	.

		Now , of course , there is a fine indifference to foolish things , as well as a foolish indifference to fine things and foolish things alike .

		And equally , of course ,
Miss Guiney	LOCATION	has somewhere in mind the hope that she has really got the right article .

		But , not to be personal , we do not think she has .

		Her essays not only have no backbone and no other bones , but they have no vitals and no breath of life .

		It may be more vulgar , but we should prefer a man who , if a scholar , would always gladly learn and gladly teach , and who knew what was worth learning and teaching and what was not ; we prefer a man who , if he loves out-of-doors , loves to do things out-of-doors , even if it be to shoot deer or catch salmon ; we prefer a man who says something when he opens his mouth , even if it be not always the best and choicest remark possible , to one who smiles and can think of nothing worth saying .

		It 's a good thing to be willing to commit yourself .

		Miss
Guiney	PERSON	likes to think of
London	LOCATION	as being a quiet place ; we prefer to think of it as noisy and hustling and full of people , cads as well as others .

		Miss
Guiney	PERSON	likes to think of domestic animals conquered by man and curb - ing their great power to the melancholy superi - ority of unfeeling intellect ; we prefer leviathans which we ca n't hook and bulls in -LRB- somebody else 's -RRB- china-shop .

		Miss
Guiney	PERSON	thinks that art is made of seemly abstinences : some art may be , but to an art made of seemly absti - nences and nothing else , we prefer an art made of unseemly affirmations .

		At bottom , doubt - less , it does n't really matter what you do , and it does n't really matter whether or not you do anything ; but this fundamental principle must be kept well out of sight , unless you are willing to go still-born to the grave .

		Historically speaking , this indifferentism is partly a reaction against the violence of Car - lyle and partly a conventional imitation of the descendants of the French-romantic reaction against conventionalism .

		It has manifested itself in fine forms , and , more often , in forms like the present .

		We think , on the whole , it is a sort of dry-rot in art .

		We will bet a big red apple that anyone who reads '' Patrins '' can see what the effect of such an attitude has been on
Miss Guiney	LOCATION	.

		It has deprived her of the power of thought and the power of style .

		Each essay is based on a fancy , not on an idea .

		Each sentence is set down with tender solici - tude as to how it will look , rather than with a compelling desire that it shall mean something .

		This is a pity .

		Miss
Guiney	PERSON	could do some - thing , perhaps , if she would give up the idea that there was nothing worth her doing .

		We have spoken of Miss
Guiney	PERSON	's style , and it is best to be more particular on the subject .

		Miss
Guiney	PERSON	's style is a combination of meti - culated Emersonianism and effeminate imita - tion of
Stevenson	PERSON	.

		It takes for fundamental principle the theory that an essay is a string of aphorisms , a sequence of declarative sentences , without formal connection .

		This crude and unrhythmical kind of prose is adorned with an enormous accumulation of figures of speech and painfully selected adverbs and adjectives .

		To what is original is added an equal amount of quotation .

		The whole is stuck over with such expressions as '' marry '' and '' methinks '' and all the syntactic affectations adopted by those who have rediscovered the Elizabethans .

		Such a style we have no hesitation in pronouncing bad , no matter how clever .

		For clever this book of essays undoubtedly is , clever and '' charming '' as well .

		But certain things will have been taken for granted about Miss
Guiney	PERSON	's work , so we have thought it worth while to allude to some others .

		The Navajo are the most advanced tribe of the great Athapascan family of Indians .

		Their linguistic relatives are usually of the wilder , and in some respects least attrac - tive , tribes of the continent .

		The Apaches ,
Montagnais	ORGANIZATION	, Slaves , are among their speech kindred .

		The people are not , however , pure of blood , but are much mixed with their neighbors , notably with various Pueblo and
Shoshonean	PERSON	peoples .

		They have borrowed much from con - tact , and , being energetic , they have often im - proved their borrowings .

		Possibly they learned smithing and weaving of the Pueblos ; but if so , they now surpass their teachers .

		Their daily life and arts , their houses and industries , tales and religion , all have been profoundly influ - enced by the arid environment in which they live .

		Three classes of legends are preeminent among the stories of our Indian tribes the origin or cosmogonic legend , the migration legend , the culture-hero legend .

		Sometimes the three are clearly separated ; sometimes one story presents one element overshadowing the rest ; sometimes the three are inextricably combined .

		It is the origin legend of the Navajo that occu - pies the chief place in this book .

		In it are included elements of migration and culture-hero stories .

		The legend is long and detailed .

		It is subdivided into four sections , headed '' The story of the Emergence , '' `` Early events in the Fifth World , '' '' The War-Gods , '' The Growth of the
Navajo Nation	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The people have come up from one after another of four previous worlds into this present stage of existence the fifth world .

		Each of the worlds has its own characteristics ; in each , the people had strange experiences .

		Nothing has happened without significance , and the impress of the past is upon the present , and the songs and ceremonials of this time are the result , and in some cases the dramatization , of those ancient happenings .

		All things around that need explanation are dealt with in this native philosophy .

		Dr. Mat - thews has translated the legends simply and with directness .

		On the whole , the
Navajo Origin Legend	ORGANIZATION	appears more consistent and definite than most American Indian cosmogo - nies .

		One or two passages taken quite at ran - dom will illustrate the style and content .

		Sec - tion 163 describes the making of First Man and
First Woman	ORGANIZATION	.

		The people '' mentioned were not truly human beings : '' The gods laid one buckskin on the ground with the head to the west ; on this they placed two ears of corn , with their tips to the east , and over the corn they spread the other buckskin with its head to the east ; under the white ear they put the feather of a white eagle , under the yellow ear the feather of a yellow eagle .

		Then they told the people to stand at a distance and allow the wind to enter .

		The white wind blew from the east , and the yellow wind blew from the west , between the skins .

		While the wind was blowing , eight of the Mirage Peo - ple came and walked around the objects on the ground four times , and as they walked the eagle feathers , whose tips protruded from between the buckskins , were seen to move .

		When the Mirage People had finished their walk the upper buckskin was lifted the ears of corn had disappeared ; a man and a woman lay there in their stead . ''

		Sometimes the incidents narrated contain a hint at real happenings in the tribal history .

		Thus , it is likely that the Navajo first got maize , or corn , from the Pueblos or
Kisdni	LOCATION	, as is sug - gested by section 189 . ''

		After this it was told around that the
Kisani	PERSON	, who were in camp at a little distance from the others , had brought with them from the lower world an ear of corn for seed .

		Some of the unruly ones proposed to go to the camp of the Eisani and take the corn away from them ; but others , of better counsel , said that this would be wrong , that the
Kisani	PERSON	had had as much trouble as the rest , and if they had more foresight they had a right to profit by it .

		In spite of these words , some of the young men went and demanded the corn of the
Kisani	LOCATION	.

		The latter said , after some angry talk on both sides , ' We will break the ear in two and give you whichever half you choose . '

		The young men agreed to this bar - gain , and the woman who owned the ear broke it in the middle and laid the pieces down for the others to choose .

		The young men looked at the pieces , and were consid - ering which they would take , when
Coyote	ORGANIZATION	, getting impatient , picked up the tip end of the ear and made off with it .

		The
Kisani	PERSON	kept the butt , and this is the reason the Pueblo Indians have to-day better crops of corn than the Navajos .

		But the Pueblos had become alarmed at the threats and angry language of their neighbors and moved away from them , and this is why the Navajos and the Pueblos now live apart from one another . ''

		Throughout the legends , of course , are items of belief , tribal practices , religious customs , either described or incidentally mentioned .

		In explanation of these , Dr.
Matthews	PERSON	's notes and pictures are most valuable .

		Professor Fillmore 's discussion of the Navajo music is both interesting and valuable .

		It is based upon a considerable collection of phono - graphic records .

		While Navajo music presents perhaps little that is truly characteristic , it fairly represents American Indian music gen - 148 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, erally .

		In the words , figurative language especially metaphor and simile abounds .

		Of rhetorical forms , antithesis , synecdoche , and climax are not uncommon .

		Those peculiarly favorite devices among savage and barbarous races , repetition and refrain are everywhere .

		Rhyme is rare .

		The words of a number of the songs are given with interlinear translation into English , and the melodies of ten are written out in ordinary musical notation .

		All in all , the volume is an important con - tribution to
American Ethnography	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is the only one of the later Memoirs of the
American Folk-Lore Society	ORGANIZATION	good as they all are that is really to be placed alongside of No .

		FAITH INSTINCTIVE .

		* We may accept reason as our proper guide when - ever it is present , but there are many times when it does not cover the ground .

		We are bringing reason very freely to the task of correcting religious belief ; and yet much of that belief rests , and must continue for a long time to rest , on instinctive tendencies , and on the force of events only partially amenable to reason .

		Religion has not arisen primarily as the product of reason , but as the result of feelings and of instinctive influences , inevitable in their action , and capable only of the slowest correction by later inquiry . ''

		The heart has its reasonings which the reason knoweth nothing of . ''

		A hasty application of reason results in increasing the unreason already present in these obscure fields of thought in which so many impulses contend with each other .

		If one explores a mountain range by torchlight , he may reach a few certain conclusions , but there will re - * LATER GLEANINGS .

		main a vast amount of mystery and darkness unre - solved .

		The books under criticism enforce this relation between the clear and the obscure in faith . ''

		Later Gleanings , '' by Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	, occupies itself chiefly in putting limitations on the quick skepticism of our time .

		It is congenial to the mind of a statesman to give great force to the familiar renderings of belief , to the conceptions which , over large surfaces and for long periods , have governed men 's thoughts and actions .

		The volume is especially valuable as en - countering the feeling that the old beliefs must give way at once to the attacks of modern criticism .

		The work is made up of thirteen essays , most of them occupied with a presentation and qualified defence of current topics of religious discussion .

		Colonel Ingersoll , Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	, and Pro- fessor Huxley come under consideration .

		The vol - ume also contains several historical essays on the early history of the
Church of England	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volume on '' Christian Instincts and Modern Doubt '' contains five essays .

		The one entitled '' The Present State of Religious Thought in Great Brit - ain '' comprises most of the volume .

		The author shows much insight .

		While feeling the force of current criticism , he is in hearty sympathy with the faith-tendency which idealizes the world and makes it primarily the realm of mind .

		He does not set himself the task of a systematic defence , but ex - poses sharply in many ways the spiritual barrenness of the assaults that come from a physical rendering of the world .

		Emerson ,
Browning	PERSON	, and
Martineau	PERSON	are discussed with considerable fulness and much sympathy .

		Among the secondary essays is one entitled `` The Unwisdom of Secularism . ''

		The volume arises from a sense of the ruling force of spiritual intuitions , and yet of the many ways in which they still need reconciliation in our thoughts with the facts and events which envelope us . ''

		The Place of Death in Evolution '' involves a still deeper conviction of the spiritual thread of life appearing but obscurely and slowly in the physical history of the world , and at length separating itself out in an adequate revelation of its own higher nature .

		The book is well conceived , but the thought is atten - uated , and receives more emphasis than it will easily bear .

		If the physical relations of death had been treated as incidental to its moral relations , the pro- portion of parts would have been better preserved , and the resources of the author been more fairly dealt with . ''

		Bases of Religious Belief , Historic and Ideal , '' is a work of scholarship and insight .

		It rests on the intuitional philosophy applied with reason and correction .

		It is made up of two parts .

		The first treats of the religious questionings which have arisen in connection with historic and scientific crit - icism ; and the second , of the belief in an imma - nent intelligence , as urged on metaphysical , ethical , aesthetical , and spiritual grounds .

		The author says in the preface that he has aimed to give simply a resume of the conclusions of modern thought .

		1897 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 149 This is more apparent in the first than in the second part .

		The result is some want of firm direction in the thought .

		It is neither definitely historical nor critical .

		In the second part , the author gives more freedom to his own mind .

		The result is a well-balanced and careful statement of the grounds of belief .

		We are disposed to criticise such expressions as '' the God-consciousness '' as inaccurate and misleading , even when the under - lying idea is unobjectionable .

		The word , con - sciousness , is slipping very much away from its direct and needed use .

		Consciousness can no more be made to stand for the elements involved in consciousness than the sunlit , rippling surface of the ocean for the obscure depths hidden under it . ''

		The Open Mystery '' can hardly be pronounced a successful volume .

		It is a re-cast of the early his - toric parts of the Old Testament .

		The author assigned herself a difficult task , and had neither the insight nor the critical power necessary to make its execution interesting to the well-informed reader .

		4 < Foretokens of Immortality '' is not an unpleas - ing rendering of the familiar convictions on immor - tality .

		It will soothe and assure the thoughts of those predisposed to belief .

		It is doubtless a result of the shifting farm of religious beliefs that so many are turning to the doctrine of immortality , struggling to give it a firmer and more vital hold .

		An exhortation to courage quickens the courageous , but makes slight appeal to the timid .

		So is it with the proofs of a future life . ''

		In this Present World '' is a volume of sermons of a plain , practical , and somewhat penetrative order .

		It is a good specimen of the prolific species to which it belongs . ''

		Jesus Christ During His Ministry '' is an inter - mediate volume between two others , '' Jesus Christ Before His Ministry , '' and '' The Death and
Resur	PERSON	- rection of Jesus Christ , '' which is to follow .

		The author expresses his aims in these words : '' I pro- pose , in fact , to speak above all things of Jesus himself , to ask what he thought , what he proposed to do , what he professed to be , and , as my general title says , what he said of his person , what authority he claimed , and what work he desired to do . ''

		The book deserves warm commendation .

		The thought is clear , penetrative , and free from prolixity .

		It helps to a more realistic grasp of the life and char - acter of Christ , and of the circumstances of his ministry . ''

		Christian Worship '' is composed of a series of lectures , given in
Union Theological Seminary	ORGANIZATION	, on Liturgies , by leading men of different forms of faith .

		The introductory lecture , ` by Dr.
Charles Cuthbert Hall	PERSON	, is on '' The Principles of Christian Worship '' ; the closing lecture , by Dr.
Thomas S. Hastings	PERSON	, is on `` The Ideal of Christian Worship . ''

		The eight intervening lectures present Primitive Christian Liturgies , The Greek Liturgies , Roman Liturgies , Lutheran Liturgies , The Liturgies of the Reformed Church , The Book of Common Prayer , The Book of Common Order , Worship in Non-Liturgical Churches .

		The reader is thus put in pretty full possession of what is current in forms of Worship , and of the feeling which underlies liturgical worship . ''

		Some Aspects of the Religious Life of
New England	LOCATION	'' is a book quite in order , and interesting .

		The purpose of the author is to give '' the religious life itself its dominating motives , its characteriz - ing experiences , its manifestations of spiritual power in the careers of the men and women of the nine generations that have dwelt upon
New England	LOCATION	soil since the landing of the Pilgrims . ''

		This task he has accomplished with insight , fairness , and con - siderable fulness .

		The volume serves to emphasize in still another way the force of events in determin - ing the current tendency of religious thought .

		The reason busies itself narrowly with the particular phase of work the circumstances assign it .

		The chapter on the present period is especially interest - ing ; a period in which the sense of sin is widening out into that of ethical law , in which doctrine is displaced by social theory , and the general welfare is substituted for personal piety .

		Religious devel - opment is cyclic , with actions and reactions ; a thorough recognition of the fact makes us at once more charitable , more peaceful , and more useful .

		JOHN BASCOM .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		A volume of ^ n one ^ ms recently-published let - essays by ters , the late Master of Balliol wrote Prof essor James .

		ag f O H OW8 : I f ee l very deeply that one can not live without religion , and that in proportion as we believe less , that little , if it be only an aweful feeling about existence , must be more constantly present with us ; as faith loses in extent it must gain in intensity , if we do not mean to shipwreck altogether . ''

		This passage would serve very well as a text for the '' Essays in Popular Philosophy '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- that Professor
William James	PERSON	has brought together into a volume made up from his occasional addresses and con - tributions to periodicals during the past score of years .

		This choice of a text is chiefly justified by the first four of the essays , '' which are largely con - cerned with defending the legitimacy of religious faith . ''

		The essential position of the author might almost be illustrated by
Shelley	PERSON	's '' Prometheus , '' wherein we are exhorted '' To hope till hope creates From its own wreck the thing it contemplates . ''

		There are cases , says Professor
James	PERSON	, '' where a fact can not come at all unless a preliminary faith exists in its coming . ''

		Now while this is unde - niable as a general proposition , it is a dangerous principle to be taken as a guide by the untrained seeker after religious and philosophical truth .

		It is doubtless sometimes true , as in the case of the mountain-climber who can save his life only by a dangerous and terrible leap , that `` faith before - 150 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, hand in an uncertified result is the only thing that makes the result come true , '' hut this is not quite the same thing as saying that faith in the cardinal doctrines of religion is the condition upon which their realization depends in any other than a sub - jective sense .

		Professor
James	PERSON	might retort that this is , after all , only an ingenious way of begging the question , and that the subjective sense is the one most important to be considered in these high matters .

		But the defense that he actually does bring forward is made from a very different point of vantage , being substantially that his book is not addressed to a popular audience , exposed to the dangers of over-credulity , but rather to an aca - demic audience suffering from a '' mental weakness brought about by the notion , carefully instilled , that there is something called scientific evidence by waiting upon which they shall escape all danger of shipwreck in regard to death . ''

		There is some - thing in this , to be sure , but not quite as much as the author would have us think , and the opposed view of such men as
Clifford	LOCATION	, for example , seems to us supported by a closer-knit logical cogency .

		It is all a question of degree , and the author 's chapter on '' Psychical Research '' affords evidence that he carries his own principle of believing the things that we want to believe a little farther than most clear-sighted thinkers are willing to carry it .

		But there is no escaping the fascination of the author 's exposition of his characteristic views , and the reader is ready to say more than once : `` Al - most thou persuadest me to set in abeyance the thinking part of myself , and to let the heart dictate where the reason has held sway hitherto . ''

		The felicity of expression , the charm of manner , and the sympathetic hold upon life that are so richly displayed in these pages , make them remarkable among recent contributions to philosophical thought .

		Were the reader to reject in toto the fundamental teachings of this book , he still could not fail to profit by it , for it is the product of a rich and acute mind , which adorns every subject that it touches .

		The uncrowned monarch of the seven - teenth centur y is in this latter age beginning to stand forth in all his moral and political grandeur .

		Dr.
R. F. Horton	PERSON	has made a study of him as a religionist , and has embodied his results in ''
Oliver Cromwell	PERSON	: a Study in Personal Religion '' -LRB-
Thomas Whittaker	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The trend of his study is shown in his portrayal of the staunch , unbending , constant , moral and religious force of the almost invincible
Cromwell	PERSON	.

		This re - ligion was not a side issue of the great hero , but it was the hero himself .

		In each civil strife , in his clashes with monarchy , in his appeals for the people , sturdy , eternal , and uncompromising religious prin - ciples controlled his action .

		His devotion to the cause of humanity is but the fruit of an inward life divinely planted and nourished .

		To exhibit these traits the author recites many of the pivotal points in his active career , but does it with such a sincere and devoted purpose as to allay all differences be - tween him and those who may not agree with him .

		Young men , and older ones , too , will receive a gen - uine inspiration to nobler action in the reading of this book .

		Dr.
S. R. Gardiner	PERSON	delivered six lec - tures at the
University of Oxford	ORGANIZATION	on ''
Oliver Crom	PERSON	- well 's Place in History '' which now form a neat little volume of 120 pages -LRB- Longmans -RRB- .

		These discourses do not deal with the biography of the hero , but '' estimate his relation to the political and ecclesiastical movements of his time . ''

		Dr.
Gardiner	PERSON	embodies his lectures in a wonderfully lucid , clear , clean-cut , and forcible tongue .

		His estimate of
Cromwell	ORGANIZATION	is well-balanced , and eminently just , though not identical with some other writers .

		Crom - well , he says , '' was for that which has been the characteristic feature in English political history , the policy of bit-by-bit reform '' -LRB- p. 41 -RRB- .

		Cromwell 's settlement of
Ireland	LOCATION	was simply the beating down of everything opposed to British supremacy , while the constructive work was left to others -LRB- p. 57 -RRB- .

		Cromwell was not constructive , he was rather a mediator , a moderator -LRB- p. 81 -RRB- , embodying within himself elements '' of championship for liberty , of a crusher of free institutions , of a defender of op - pressed peoples , and of an asserter of the country 's right to dominion '' -LRB- p. 114 -RRB- . ''

		It is time for us to regard him as he really was , with all his physical and moral audacity , with all his tenderness and spiritual yearnings , in the world of action what
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	was in the world of thought , the great - est , because the most typical , Englishman .

		General
James Grant Wilson	PERSON	, in
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	.

		his study of
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	in the `` Great Commanders Series '' -LRB-
D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , necessarily devotes most of his attention to the period of the Civil War .

		A brief sketch is given of the points of interest in the life of Grant both before and after that period , but it is for the most part written in a perfunctory man - ner .

		On the other hand , the story of the great campaigns is told with enthusiasm and with clear - ness , though it is possible that , to a non-military reader , the detailed accounts of the movements of this or that brigade or regiment may be somewhat confusing .

		These details will , no doubt , be of great interest to the old soldier who took part in the battles described , or to one who desires to make a careful study of them .

		But the majority of the readers of this book will not have had any military training , and therefore will not be able to estimate , from mere detailed battle accounts , the genius of the man who commanded in battle .

		What is needed is either broader and less technical descriptions of battles and campaigns , with more of the personality of Grant thrown into and illuminating them , or explanatory notes to indicate wherein such and such a movement or march gave evidence of great mili - tary ability .

Illinois	LOCATION	to his final victory over Lee in
Virginia	LOCATION	, the impres - sion is left upon the mind of the reader that all that has been learned about
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	's great genius in war is that he was aggressive , courageous , and always confident of the ultimate success of his cause .

		By far the most interesting portion of the work is to be found in the letters to the Hon.
E. B. Washburne	PERSON	, for in these
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	revealed to his friend sentiments and opinions not often shown even to his intimates .

		The concluding chap - ter , also , upon

		They present a history of its dis - coveries from

		After a somewhat elaborate sketch of that section of
Kentucky	LOCATION	, the guides lead off to the route of pits and domes .

		Many questions of the visitor are answered by the well-prepared chapter on '' the natural history of the cavern . ''

		The book - let is illustrated by a large number of beautiful half - tone cuts of some of the most pleasing and startling views in the cavern .

		In
1893	DATE	, President
Whitsitt	PERSON	of the
Southern Baptist Theological Sem	ORGANIZATION	- inary published two articles in ''
Johnson	PERSON	's Universal Cyclopaedia '' on '' Anabaptists '' and '' Baptists '' in which he held that the evidence at hand does not warrant one in asserting that the English Baptists practised immersion as baptism prior to
1641	DATE	.

		In the Cyclopdia Dr.
Whitsitt	PERSON	says regarding the baptism of
Roger Williams	PERSON	: '' The ceremony was most likely performed by sprinkling ; the Baptists of
England	LOCATION	had not yet adopted immersion , and there is no reason which renders it probable that
Williams	PERSON	was in advance of them in that regard . ''

		The venerable pastor , Dr.
H. M. King	PERSON	, of the
First Baptist Church of Providence , Williams	ORGANIZATION	's stamping ground , promptly calls down the
Southern Seminary President	ORGANIZATION	, and , if argument and evidence settle the case , states and makes his point with clearness and precision , that

		It makes a sumptuous volume of nearly six hundred pages , illustrated by facsimile title-pages , a vignette of the interior of the Athenseum , and an engraving of the Stuart portrait .

		The Wash - ington collection of books was begun in
1848	DATE	, when a number of citizens subscribed to a fund for the purchase of books from the

Sept. 16	DATE	, ANNOUNCEMENTS OP FALL , BOOKS .

		THE DIAL 'S list of books announced for Fall issue by American publishers , which has become an important annual feature of the paper , is this year very much the largest ever given .

		It contains over 1100 titles , against 900 last year ; and represents sixty houses , nine more than last year .

		The feeling of encouragement and general improvement that marks the business world at present has evidently reached the publishers , and the showing made by them in the following List reflects the greatest credit on their activity and energy .

		The outlook for a prosperous season is certainly good , and the American publishing trade is to be congratulated on its alertness to take advantage of the '' turn in the tide . ''

		The classification of the books into departments adds greatly to the usefulness and interest of the List , and furnishes the basis of some analysis and comment in the leading editorial article of this issue .

		The department of Juveniles is deferred until our next number .

		All the books here given are presumably new books new editions not being included unless having new form or matter ; and the List does not include Fall books already issued and entered in our regular List of New Books .

A. S. Barnes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by
Julia M. Colton	PERSON	, an account is given of all the more important events of Swiss his - tory .

		The book is well written and accurate , but the author confines herself so closely to the statement of political events that little impression or picture of the Swiss as a people is left to the reader .

		A good index makes the work valuable for handy reference .

		Messrs.
T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are still engaged in the praiseworthy work of publishing editions of standard literature that are at once attractive and inexpensive .

		Among their recent issues we note with particular satisfaction four volumes of their pretty '' Faience '' edition , including
Hawthorne	PERSON	's '' Scarlet Letter , ''
Meri	PERSON	- meVs '' Colomba , '' Sir
Lewis Morris	PERSON	's '' Epic of Hades , '' and
M. Anatole France	PERSON	's '' Crime of
Sylvestre Bon	ORGANIZATION	- nard . ''

		Messrs.
Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	have just published a new edition of '' Mrs.
Keith	PERSON	's Crime , '' by Mrs.
W. K. Clifford	PERSON	.

		This rather remarkable novel first appeared in
1885	DATE	, when the author was entirely unknown , except as the widow of the brilliant scholar whose name she bears .

		It has many crudities , but a certain underlying power has kept it alive , and many readers who know Mrs.
Clifford	PERSON	only through her later novels will be glad of the opportunity to revert to her first piece of fictional work .

		Messrs.
L. C. Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	announce a new edition of Mr.
William Kirby	PERSON	's romance , '' The Golden Dog . ''

		The publication is authorized by Mr.
Kirby	PERSON	, and the fact that the author is still living will come as a surprise to many readers , for his book somehow seems to belong to a very remote past .

		It is still very popular in
Canada	LOCATION	, and its only rival , according to the testimony of the stalls and windows of book-shops in
Montreal	LOCATION	and
Quebec	LOCATION	, appears to be Mr.
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	's '' The Seats of the Mighty . ''

		The object of a new edition of the '' Faerie Queene , '' projected by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is to supply a pleasant , handy , inexpensive edition for general use .

		Each of the six volumes is to contain one book , and the first volume is now issued .

		Its special features are a brief introduc - tion by the editor ,
Kate M. Warren	PERSON	, a somewhat full glossary , and a sufficient number of notes at the end of the volume to serve the uses of those who have neither access to larger editions , nor time to consult books of reference .


Wagner	PERSON	's novelette , '' A Pilgrimage to Beethoven , '' was written by the composer during his first stay in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Although it was a sort of pot-boiler , it has sufficient importance to warrant its preservation as a piece of literature , while its value is great considered as a document in the life-history of that extraordinary genius .

		The chevalier tells his own story , but he is the most charming of egoists .

		He wins our sympathies from the outset by his boyish naivete , his downright manliness and bravery ... Not only has Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	written an excellent tale of adventure , but he has shown a close study of character which does not borrow merely from the trappings of historical actors , but which denotes a keen knowledge of human nature , and a shrewd insight into the workings of human motives ... The fashion of the period is kept well in mind , the style of writing has just that touch of old-fashioned formality which serves to veil the past from the present , and to throw the lights and shadows into a harmony of tone ... The work has literary quality of a genuine sort in it , which raises it above a numerous host of its fellows in kind . ''

		This work , based on thirty years ' expe - rience of teaching French to English boys , does not profess to be a systematic grammar or dictionary , but to combine many of the practical advantages of both , with the addition of much which is not generally to be found in either .

		The chief difficulties which an En - tlishman finds in learning to speak French uently and correctly arise from the forma - tion of sentences , the collocation of words , the similarity of words and phrases in the two languages which are really different , and the dissimilarity of those which are frequently the same .

		Rules and examples for the avoid - ing of these pitfalls are given in this book , and , in addition , a section on '' Deceptive Resemblances , '' and a list of 3,000 idiomatic expressions in everyday use .

		194 A LITERARY ANNIVERSARY .

		The
October	DATE	number of '' The Atlantic Monthly , '' which celebrates the fortieth anni - versary of that periodical , is as noteworthy an issue of a magazine as has ever appeared in this country , and is at the same time sugges - tive of a good many reflections concerning the history of American literature , both periodical and general .

		In this case , indeed , the ordi - nary distinction between these two kinds of literature , together with the implied notion that one is inferior to the other , very nearly vanishes , so closely have the interests of the ''
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' always been bound up with those of literature in the best sense .

		Not only has a large part of what we all recognize as the per - manent literature of the nation first seen the light in the pages of this magazine , but it has also occupied from the start , and with no lapse from its high aims , the unique position ex - pressed by its constant purpose '' to hold liter - ature above all other human interests , and to suffer no confusion of its ideals . ''

		In describ - ing the position of the ``
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' as unique , we have no intention of disparaging the work done by the illustrated monthlies , which have placed so much wholesome and instructive reading in the hands of the public , which have contributed so notably to the development of popular artistic taste , and which have offered so generous an encouragement to the profes - sion of letters by providing a satisfactory mar - ket for all sorts of good work .

		But the fact remains that the great success of the ''
Atlan	PERSON	- tic '' has been achieved and maintained without the adventitious aid of pictures , that the time - liness of a theme or the notoriety of a writer have never alone been sufficient to secure ad - mission to its pages , and that it has not been willing to attack the social and political abuses of the time unless it might enlist the grace of literary form as an efficient ally in the crusade .

		The temptation to pursue ideals somewhat less severe than these must sometimes have been very great .

		The illustrated monthlies have grown up and flourished like green bay trees -LRB- although we would not have the simile of the Psalmist carried to its logical conclusion in all their cases -RRB- , while the ``
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' has enjoyed its modest prosperity in unenvious self-respect .

		It has seen some of its contemporaries broaden their circulation to an extent tenfold that of its own without swerving from the lines which it originally marked out .

		It has viewed with equa - nimity their successful exploitation of one popu lar theme after another , and has refrained from following their example , so alluring from the standpoint of the counting-room , because their methods savored necessarily of journalism .

		It has stood calmly aside while the lions of the hour have been captured and placed on exhib - ition by other magazines , because its editors have always demanded something more than the ephemeral interest that attaches to men and subjects that are but the fashion of the 174 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, day .

		It has eschewed the pictorial appeal to popularity because of its abiding faith in the virtue of a singleness of aim , and because it has recognized the fact that illustrations can not be associated with literature without some lower - ing of the technical standards of the latter art .

		And for the exercise of this threefold restraint , if it has fallen behind in the race for commer - cial success , it has won the respect and the loyalty of all who can fitly appreciate a fine ideal constantly pursued , of all for whom the dignity of the literary calling is a matter of deep personal concern . ''

		Holding fast to the faith of its founders , '' such is its proud and well - warranted boast , `` that literature is one of the most serious concerns of men , and that the high - est service to our national life is the encour - agement and the production of literature , the `
Atlantic	LOCATION	' has never had owner or editor who was tempted to change its steadfast course by reason of any changing fashion . ''

		The names of the owners and editors who have thus handed down the magazine whose record is so enviable are inscribed upon a roll of honor in the minds of the generation that has grown up with the life of the ''
Atlantic	LOCATION	. ''

		Of the publishers there are
Phillips , Sampson & Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Ticknor	PERSON	and Fields , and the successors of the latter down to the present firm of Messrs.
Hough	PERSON	ton ,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Of the editors there are
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	, -LRB- 1859-61 -RRB- , Fields -LRB- 1861-71 -RRB- , Mr.
Howells	PERSON	-LRB- 1871-80 -RRB- , Mr.
Aldrich	PERSON	-LRB- 1880 90 -RRB- , and Mr.
Scudder	PERSON	-LRB- 1 890-97 -RRB- .

		Nor must we omit the name of Mr.
Walter H. Page	PERSON	, who became associated with Mr.
Scudder	PERSON	in
1895	DATE	, and whose vigorous editorial policy has given new life and strength to the magazine during the past two years .

		Some of the recent numbers , indeed , have contained groups of articles so solid in content and so dignified in form as to challenge a favorable comparison with the best issues of the old days , when the contributors to the magazine included the half dozen greatest men in American literature .

		A list of the famous productions that first saw the light in the ''
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' would be too lengthy to find a place in these notes , and only a few may be even mentioned .

		At the very start ,
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	insisted `` that Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	should be engaged as the first contributor , '' and to that insistence we owe the fact that the first number contained the beginning of the '' Auto - crat '' papers .

		Emerson 's '' Brahma '' also ap - peared in that first number , and proved `` caviare to the general . ''

		There were a dozen other prin - cipal contributors besides these two , and three of them are living to-day .

		A few of the famous poems written for the ''
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' are ''
Paul Revere	PERSON	's Ride , '' `` The Wonderful
One-Hoss Shay	PERSON	, '' `` The Chambered Nautilus , '' ''
Barbara Frietchie	PERSON	, '' `` The Commemoration Ode , '' `` Friar
Jerome	PERSON	's Beautiful Book , '' `` The Fool 's Prayer , '' and '' Prospice . ''

		We name only poems so gen - erally familiar that the names of their authors come to the mind at once .

		In fiction , besides the many serials , there are such stories as ''
Marjorie Daw	PERSON	'' and '' The Man Without a Country . ''

		In sober scholarship there are such writings as
Clarke	PERSON	's '' Ten Great Religions , '' and the scientific papers of Agassiz .

		In short , there is no department of American literature , whether creative or scholarly , that would not be much the poorer were it without the works that have represented it in the ''
Atlantic	LOCATION	Monthly . ''

		For forty years , then , this magazine has been devoted to '' literature , science , art , and politics '' -LRB- so runs the cover - title -RRB- , and `` literature '' has rarely been missing even from the treatment of the other major themes .

		The editor draws a parallel between the contents of the magazine for its first and its fortieth years which well shows how steadfastly the same intellectual aims have been pursued .

		Rather than repeat this comparison , we prefer to suggest certain con - trasts between the contents of the anniversary issue now before us and any possible issue of the magazine forty years ago .

		The proverb that men and their interests change with the changing times could not receive a better illus - tration .

		Mr.
James Lane Allen	PERSON	's '' Two
Prin	PERSON	- ciples in Recent American Fiction '' requires for its inductions a literature of some matur - ity , and such a paper could hardly have been written in
1857	DATE	.

		M. Brunetiere 's contribution stands for our modern cosmopolitanism , and an essay by a foreign critic would have been a strange phenomenon indeed in the provin - cial days of the ''
Atlantic	LOCATION	. ''

		Almost equally strange would have been an essay upon a young contemporary Italian novelist , and such a nov - elist could he have been discovered as Sig - nor d'Annunzio . ''

		A Russian Experiment in Self-Government , '' by Mr.
Kennan	PERSON	, embodies a whole range of ideas that forty years ago had hardly found their way into the consciousness of writers upon political and sociological prob - lems .

		In fact , there was no `` sociology '' in those days , and political science scorned those studies in primitive organization that are now its very life-blood .

		`` The Old View of Child - hood and the New '' presents a contrast that
1897	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 175 could hardly have been imagined at a time when all views of childhood were indistin - guishably old , and when pedagogy had not yet reared its head among the arts .

		As for a story of '' Twenty-five Years ' Progress in
Equatorial Africa	LOCATION	, '' if told at all in
1857	DATE	, it would have been either like the story of `` a cycle of Cathay , '' or a bold essay in romantic fiction .

		At that time there were no '' Recent Discov - eries Respecting the Origin of the Universe , '' for the instrument was unknown that should first make such discoveries possible ; and there could not have been any discussion of `` The Upward Movement in
Chicago	LOCATION	, '' for there was no
Chicago	LOCATION	worth viewing from such a stand - point .

		Finally , we may remark that the very interesting article entitled '' Forty Years of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	Monthly '' could hardly have had a prototype even of the prospective sort , in the first year of the magazine 's history , for no prophetic vision could have foreseen that the problem offered by the material subduing of a new continent was to be succeeded by the infinitely more difficult problem of subduing its rapidly expanding population to the decen - cies and the amenities of civilized life , or that the `` Atlantic Monthly '' would become so po - tent an agency in the performance of that latter gigantic task .

		LITERARY VAL
UES	ORGANIZATION	.

		A few years ago it was widely conceded that
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	had invented style , that
Tolstoi	PERSON	had discovered human nature , and that
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	had said the last word about the problem of the universe .

		Dissentients there were , indeed , who held that
Flaubert	PERSON	was really the first writer who had ever properly expressed himself , that the Goncourts had dug up those '' human documents '' we have heard so much about , and that Renan had given the final thrust to theology and philosophy with his dagger of ironical condescension .

		It has always been so , I suppose .

		In the forties they were wondering where Macaulay '' got that style , '' and had little doubt that
Dickens	PERSON	had super - seded
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is with literature as with the weather our memories are short , and every season is the hottest or the wettest we have known .

		Now , however , that we are nearing our century 's end , there is noticeable a pause , a lull in our lauda - tion of ourselves .

		We are beginning to wonder how our time will appear at the roll-call of the ages .

		Modernity in literature is a taking bait .

		People have a natural prejudice for reading about them - selves and their sons-in-law .

		They like to see in print familiar names and places .

		But after all , the main things we have to write about are the perma - nent facts of nature , and the emotions , thoughts , and actions of our unchanging humanity .

		An author who tries to create a literature out of his own head may be modern , but he is not like to become immor - tal .

		Even the decalogue promises long life to those who honor their fathers and their mothers .

		There are authors like
Spinoza	ORGANIZATION	and
Kant	PERSON	, who have , of course , no concern with the concrete mani - festations of character , and who might as well ex - press themselves in algebraic symbols as in common language for all they have to do with style , yet who , nevertheless , have that in their thought which lifts their works out of the category of the mere litera - ture of knowledge , the dull domain of facts , and places them among the proud imaginations of man - kind .

		There are authors , like Le Sage and
Dumas	PERSON	and
Jane Austen	PERSON	, who have hardly an idea to their backs , and no more style than is needed to tell a story rapidly and plainly , yet whose creative force power over essential human nature is so pro- digious that ''
Gil	PERSON	Bias '' and '' The Three Guards - men '' and '' Pride and Prejudice '' are like to last as long as men read .

		And of course there are au - thors , like Gray , who coin the commonplaces of the world into words of gold .

		Style is not single but complex .

		It is hard to catch it in the act , to fix this
Cynthnia	PERSON	of the min - ute in any one toilet .

		As far as prose is concerned , style seems to be a vivid realization of all that can be said on a subject and an apt selection of the most telling points .

		It certainly does not consist in hunt - ing for fine words .

		Mr.
Pater	PERSON	, in his essay on Style , concentrates his attention on a single writer
Gustave Flaubert	PERSON	; and lovingly describes his agonies of composition .

		A greater master of ex - pression than
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	,
John Keats	PERSON	, says of poetry that if it did not come easily it had better not come at all .

		Keats , in the old phrase , corrected his verses with care , but he made no fuss about it .

		We do not correct our verse or prose to-day ; we strive for the '' ultimate word , '' the '' chiseled phrase , '' the '' enamelled expression , '' and record our struggles with complacency , as if the contortions of the
Sybil	PERSON	were of more importance than the oracle she has to utter .

		Still speaking of prose , the more we regard style the more it resolves itself into mental endowments , thought , imagination and so forth .

		I open a story of Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	's who , if not the first of writers , is a very good one I open ''
Mark	PERSON	- heim '' or '' The Pavilion on the Links , '' and what do I find ?

		An original and audacious way of look - ing at things , and much richness of experience and imagination .

		He has plenty of the bank-notes of thought in his pocket , and does not have to make one idea do the work of ten .

		Mere terseness and happiness of language follow as naturally as the day the sun .

		A great deal of modern prose , however , is given up to the attempt to do more than exhibit what the author has inside him .

		It tries to rival painting in rendering nature , and music in repro - ducing sound , and is so delicate of scent that , as Catullus says , you wish you were all one nose .

		176 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	,
Marini	PERSON	and
Gongora	PERSON	and the Pre ` cieuses of Moliere are re-born in every generation .

		There are styles to - day which can only be understood through the pores .

		Poetry is on quite another footing in regard to style .

		It is a formal art .

		Something sensuous is added to the idea .

		It is its business to be beautiful , its right to be adorned .

		Prose ought to go straight to the mark ; it is the paradox of poetry that in it a curved line is the shortest distance between two points .

		Perhaps every poem which has got itself remembered has a certain movement which dis - tinguishes it from all other verse .

		It is in this matter that poetry has its triumph over prose .

		Prose may be , though it seldom is , as concentrated as verse ; thought and creative force may express themselves as well in one as in the other , but the returns , the correspondences , the accelerations , the retardations , the discords , and the harmonies of verse give it a power to express life itself .

		It is motion made apparent .

		Both in poetry and prose , style seems to demand an indescribable union of personality and the past .

		One must be individual , or as a stylist one does not exist ; one must be universal , or as a stylist one dies .

		Many can model themselves on the masters , but they will fail of style for a lack of that freedom and freshness which can only come from some inward fount .

		Many may have a native daring , strength , and originality , yet fail of style for want of mod - eration and measure .

		It is necessary to fight for one 's own hand , yet to follow a flag which has led the generations .

		Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	, in the mass of his work , tried to write Latin prose in English , and achieved no style .

		Carlyle , in `` Sartor Resartus , '' threw aside all reasonable restraints of language , and achieved no style .

		It is a narrow bridge to walk , and there is an abyss on either hand .

		To have style is to be of equal validity with nat - ural things , to be as strong as winds and tides and sunbeams ; to have creative power is to be as a god .

		It is an uncalculable thing to create a real human being , and to create a world is more than to con - quer one .

		An appearance of the gift is common enough .

		Mimicry and observation will do the trick .

		Readers are quite ready to make believe ; and as children christen a stick or a rag , and read into it all the qualities of a living baby , so grown folk accept from their novelists or their historians who are only novelists who plagiarize their plots and do not have to invent names for their characters labelled dummies , and for the instant think that they are alive .

		But a genuine creation is a different thing .

		It is a magnet of tremendous strength , and tends to draw all minds to it and make them like itself .

		Achilles created
Greece	LOCATION	in his own image , and
Hamlet	LOCATION	has almost absorbed
Germany	LOCATION	.

		There are many bad ways of creating character .

		Our contemporary trick of dialect and local color must have been the invention of a lazy writer who wished to make other people write his books for him .

		The exploitation of what is called a '' type '' is another feeble method .

		The moment an author looks upon another human being from a superior point of view , and hails him as a '' type , '' he ceases to have any power over him .

		The old method of '' humors '' practiced by
Ben Johnson	PERSON	had a better reason in it , though of course it was quite false .

		Of all the amazing methods of creation , however , that produced by
Victor Hugo	PERSON	was the queerest .

		He went by recipe so many ingredients to such a result .

		Some of his explanations as to how he made his characters read like directions for compounding an omelette or a sauce !

		Character in analysis is the last infirmity of minds which are almost genu - inely creative .

		It is so near life , it betrays as a rule such knowledge of human nature , that one is tempted to take it for what it seems .

		But in the main it is a puzzle put together only to be taken apart .

		Invention is not enough , observation is not enough .

		Great as
Hawthorne	LOCATION	is , there is a quality of cold curiosity in his dealings with some of his creatures which is as repellant in effect as a surgical operation .

		Enthusiasm and admiration are neces - sary even in satire .

		One half of
Dryden	ORGANIZATION	's charac - ters of
Rochester	LOCATION	and Shaftesbury , and of Pope 's
Addison	PERSON	and Villiers , are superb and unmeasured eulogy .

		What the poet or novelist needs to do is to draw his creation into his soul live in it and feel for it the love that mothers bear for their chil - dren , whether they are good or evil .

		This method has the one disadvantage that it stamps something of the creator 's personality upon the creation , so that all
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's men are poets and all Mo - liere 's wits .

		The fact that an author has enjoyed a character is one test of its reality .


Jane Austen	PERSON	evidently delighted in her curates , whereas Char - lotte BrontS half hated and wholly dispised hers .

		The difference is felt .

		There is hardly anyone in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's world villains , criminals , or fools included whom he did not evidently love , hardly any one against whom he would have been willing to draw an indictment .

		It is curious , indeed , that wickedness and weak - ness force themselves to the front as the protago - nists of almost every drama .

		Great literature is the biography of criminals and fools .

		Average moral - ity and average intelligence are not the stuff out of which to create characters that will interest .

		Evil , indeed , seems to be the energetic force of the uni - verse , and is the cause of the obstacles and collis - ions from which events
spring	DATE	.

		Every great cre - ative poet is a Manichaean .

		In spite of himself ,
Milton	PERSON	was forced to make the devil his hero ; and
Richardson	PERSON	was shocked to discover that his Love - lace was a most attractive monster .

		The populace are willing to pay for crime .

		Nothing sells a news - paper like a murder .

		Even in the natural world , those lurid villians of nature 's melodrama , the light - ning and the storm , get infinitely more spectators than the milder and beneficent agencies of sunlight and dew .

		Goethe said that he had learned from
Poly	LOCATION	- gnotus that our business on this earth was to enact hell .

		Except
Poe	PERSON	and
Hawthorne	PERSON	, no American writer has ever had any suspicion of this fact .

		Ever

		THE DIAL 177 since that adventure in
Boston Harbor	LOCATION	, there has been a flavor of tea in all
New England	LOCATION	literature .

		One test of a creation is to note whether it is per - fectly clear and understandable .

		If it is , it prob - ably is a bad piece of work , a puppet moved by wheels and pulleys , and warranted to do the same thing whenever wound up .

		About the greatest fig - ures in fiction , there is something of mystery , some possibilities of the unexpected .

		We do not under - stand them thoroughly , any more than we under - stand our neighbors or ourselves .

		Goethe 's Hamlet is the real one , but so is
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's , and
Hazlitt	PERSON	's , and
Kean	PERSON	's , and Booth 's , and Irving 's , and yours and mine .

		However diverse and contradictory these different impressions are , they are all aspects of the one mighty and mysterious figure which is forever veiled from full view .

		Thought and thinkers have gone a good deal out of favor of late .

		We have acquired a practical turn of mind , and our crowned contemporaries are not metaphysicians or preachers , but electricians and the like .

		Foe , who was a great critic in his own lines , conducted a life-long polemic against didacticism and metaphysics .

		It is curious to note , though , that he is perhaps the most metaphysical poet in the whole range of literature .

		The concepts of
Time and Space	ORGANIZATION	, Birth and Decay , Being and Non-Being , wander up and down his works like ghosts in a deserted house .

		Herein lies his superi - ority to
Hawthorne	LOCATION	, whose speculations were theo - logical , and exercised mainly on the question of sin and redemption , hardly touching the wider prob - lem of Evil .

		However it has come about , the pro- found subjects that have engaged literature for all ages are tabooed to it , and writers are bidden to seek lighter and more objective themes .

		And why ?

		The abstract is not the didactic .

		To think in poetry does not imply that you are going to turn
Adam Smith	PERSON	into rhyme .

		Abstractions lie at the root of life , and we can not produce the flower without planting the slip in the ground .

		Man must think , or sink to the level of the animals .

		He is fighting in the dark , thrusting and parrying against an ob - scure opponent , and he does not know whether it is named Annihilation or Immortality .

		Granted that the problems that rise about us are insoluable by any system of speculation , yet by facing them man will at least realize his soul , which by forgetting them will die out of him .

		Arnold , in his essay on
Wordsworth	PERSON	, condemns the poetry of revolt .

		But what great literature is there which is not the literature of revolt ?

		Ideal poetry and satire
spring	DATE	alike from one root a pro- found dissatisfaction with ordinary life .

		Job com - plains , and Achilles sulks in anger , and Prometheus rebels , and
Faust	ORGANIZATION	makes pact with the Enemy , and Alceste in proud honesty wishes to leave the world , and
Don Juan	PERSON	, with indomitable will , wishes to ruin it .

		Everywhere there is revolt and upheaval .

		What is the secret of those proud and melancholy souls , the great poets , which so embitters them with life ?

		Is it not that they carry within them a standard of perfection and greatness , measured by which the world stands condemned ?

		The world knows very well how to protect itself from its disgusted great men .

		Homer and
Dante	PERSON	were compelled to be little better than tramps ;
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and Moliere were , by the law of the land , vagabonds , and in a day when they hanged that sort of people in order , I suppose , to give them some visible means of support .

		But the ideal and standard of the poet always ends in prevailing , in being accepted though never in being realized .

		Is it too late for another word about '' Patrins '' ?

		Mr.
Hale	PERSON	, in his article on the book and its author in THE DIAL of
September 16	DATE	, seems to agree with
Wetherell	PERSON	's criticism of the Inquirendo : '' It is well , lopsided ; and so mortal serious you know , '' but may we not quite fairly add his conclusion : `` Not that it is n't great fun , too .

		You will carry the audience . ''

		Mr.
William Dean Howells	PERSON	argues quite convincingly that it is not within the province of the critic to decide whether a story is worth telling , but whether it is well told : he is to say whether it is good of its kind , not whether the kind is to his personal liking .

		Therefore , if a man deliberately announces , '' I go a-gypseying , '' we need not apply strictly commercial tests to his gleanings , or insist that he bring back with him a bag of wheat , threshed and winnowed of chaff .

		Bather does not the declaration stir something within us to respond , '' We also go with thee , '' as when your favorite playmate used to say , '' C 'm on : le 's go somewhere . ''

		Life has other staples than wheat , and there is both value and delight in mint and bramble-berries , and that nondescript plunder with which
Nature	ORGANIZATION	entices her chil - dren into the `` Great Playground . ''

		We never outgrow the idyllic delights of sauntering , of simply going somewhere outside of beaten paths ; cut - ting switches for the pleasant feel of the smooth bark ; watching the minnows at the footbridge , and leaning with delicious tremors over the deep hole by the hem - lock ; turning aside for sweet-flag and choke-cherries , browsing on spicy birch twigs , sprouting beech-mast , slippery-elm bark , or whatever wild delicacy may be in season .

		Does any man grow up properly who never filled a torn hat with small , russetty sugar-sweetings and lay blissfully in the warm stubble to munch them and fling the cores at a grey spot on the gnarled trunk ?

		`` Going somewhere , '' with no thought of arriving ; `` do - ing nothing out of doors '' but healthily busy in fellow - ship with the great universe of things that are leisurely ripening , and soaking full of sweetness and sunshine .

		There is need of plowing and sowing and gathering into barns , but this is the legitimate '' return of the native '' to the patrimony inherited from Eden before the trouble - some specification about '' the sweat of thy brow , '' was inserted in the title-deeds .

		Miss
Guiney	PERSON	is at her best when she invites us to these excursions , discoursing meanwhile in such whim - sical fashion that the veriest plodder must smile 178 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, indulgently as he turns from his task to listen , even though she mocks at his ambition and reviles his assumptions .

		He need not take her altogether in earn - est or insist that the stone she throws at pretentious learning is really aimed at kindly wisdom , insensibly diffusing its atmosphere of peace .

		To be able to carry the '' patrimony of liberal education along with one as a sure and inseparable treasure , '' without '' feeling it any burden or incumbrance '' this surely is not to turn traitor to one 's opportunities or be disqualified for good citizenship , and if we confess that Miss
Guiney	PERSON	's '' lib - eral education '' in the wit and wisdom of the
Eliza	PERSON	- bethans is sometimes an incumbrance to her talk , we need not deny her the '' power of thought and the power of style . ''

		Is this really a trifling age in which men are in danger of turning aside at every tempting stile to stroll in flowery meadows when they should be girding up their loins and addressing themselves seriously to their journey ?

		Are there not more than enough serious books , considering that we ourselves do not wish to read them , but only feel that their perusal would benefit our neighbors ? ''

		The Great Playground '' never seemed so attractive ; the '' Harmless Scholar '' is infinitely fas - cinating , and we feel sure it was he who , in some happy moment , dreamed out the true '' Ethics of Descent . ''

		Is '' Quiet
London	LOCATION	'' a misnomer ?

		But who knows Lon - don if not Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	, and has he not declared that in
London	LOCATION	alone one may find a typical and abso - lutely perfect rural walk , over such velvet turf , under such majestic trees , that he longs to be a department clerk , compelled to traverse its delightful way morning and evening . ''

		Puppy '' and '' A Fine Gentleman '' are improving acquaintances , worthy to be named in the same category with many a literary politician ; certainly they do not discredit '' His Late Majesty '' by their manners or morals .

		We even prefer their companionship to that of royalty , and could wish that
Miss Guiney	LOCATION	in her gyp - seying had gone oftener afield through the green lanes frequented by such nnpatented nobility , leaving
King Charles	PERSON	to his parks and pleasure grounds , but even so we feel she is quite sure to '' carry the audience . ''

		SIR
HARRY JOHNSTON	PERSON	IN BRITISH CJCNTRAL ,
AFRICA	LOCATION	.

		* The region somewhat pretentiously styled
British Central Africa	LOCATION	lies north of the
Zambesi	LOCATION	and in the
South Central	LOCATION	part of the continent ^ and is bounded on the north by
Lake Tangan	LOCATION	- yika and the
Congo Free State	ORGANIZATION	, on the north - east by German
East Africa	LOCATION	, and on the east , south-east , and west by Portuguese posses - sions .

		Politically the country is divided into
Sphere of Influence	ORGANIZATION	and Protectorate the former division being administered under the charter of the
British South Africa Company	ORGANIZATION	, the latter under the
Imperial Government	ORGANIZATION	di - rectly .

		The
Sphere of Influence	ORGANIZATION	is much larger than the actual Protectorate , which ia chiefly confined to the districts bordering on
Lake Nyasa	LOCATION	and on the river
Shire	PERSON	.

		The chief agent in bringing this region under British control was Sir
Harry H. Johnston	PERSON	, the accom - plished and versatile author of the volume now before us .

		The ambitious title '' British Cen - tral
Africa	LOCATION	'' was , it seems , prospectively -LRB- and , as it turned out , prematurely -RRB- conferred by Sir
Harry	PERSON	, who hoped at the time that it would cover a larger and , politically , a much more im - portant district than it now does .

		As he says : '' On the principle that it is disastrous to a dog 's in - terest to give him a bad name , it should be equally true that much is gained at the outset of any enterprise by bestowing on it a promising title .

		I therefore chose that of ' British Central Africa ' because I hoped the new sphere of British influence might include much of
Central Africa	LOCATION	where , at the time these deeds were done , the territories of foreign powers were in a state of flux , no hard and fast boundaries having been determined j therefore by fair means
Great Britain	LOCATION	's share north of the
Zambesi	LOCATION	might be made to connect her Protectorate on the
Upper Nile	ORGANIZATION	with her Empire south of the Zam - besi . ''

		Eventually , however , the well-laid schemes of the author and his political chiefs looking to continuity of British possessions went u a-gley , '' the boundaries of German
East Africa	LOCATION	and of the
Congo Free State	ORGANIZATION	becoming conterminous in the district north of
Tanganyika	LOCATION	, an arrange - ment which interposed a strip of foreign terri - tory between
British Central Africa	ORGANIZATION	and the English Protectorate to the north of it .

		THE DIAL 179 granted by the terms of the
Anglo-German Convention	ORGANIZATION	.

		Similarly the Belgian agents were able to establish their claims to the country west and southwest of
Tanganyika	LOCATION	; so that
British Central Africa	LOCATION	, so far from attaining the territorial limits and relations to which its founder originally aspired , is now a compara - tively isolated inland country having free ac - cess to the sea only by a navigable river under international control , and forming a nearly exact geographical parallel to the
State of Para	ORGANIZATION	- guay in
South America	LOCATION	.

		The present work deals only with that east - ern portion of British Central Africa which came within the author 's personal experience , that is to say it is mainly confined to the reg - ions bordering on
Lakes Tanganyika	LOCATION	and the
Shire	LOCATION	river .

		Of these comparatively little known regions it gives by far the fullest , weight - iest , and most entertaining account that has yet appeared .

		The narrative and descriptive por - tions of the work are as a whole admirably done they are so well done , indeed , that one regrets the more a certain rather trifling or flippant note that crops out in them occasion - ally , and tends to lower the tone of a scholarly and in some respects even brilliant book .

		It will prove something of a shock , for instance , to the serious reader to find an eminent natur - alist and geographer suddenly dropping the thread of his recital to refresh himself with a quite irrelevant scrap of doggerel , such as this : '' There are all sorts of girls , there is every kind of girl , There are some that are foolish , and many that are wise ; You can trust them all .

		no doubt , but be careful to look out For the harmless little girlie with the downcast eyes . ''

		No book is the worse for humor ; but humor , like Sir
Harry Johnston	PERSON	's '' girls , '' has its sorts and kinds .

		The author has treated his theme with ency - clopaedic fulness , as a glance at the table of contents indicates .

		Chapter I. tells us , by means of a vividly picturesque series of typical set scenes and panoramas , '' What the Country Looks Like . ''

		The succeeding eleven chapters discuss severally the '' Physical Geography of the Country '' ; its '' History '' -LRB- which really begins with
Livingstone	PERSON	, though the author hazards some interesting conjectures as to its remote past , based on researches into language , examination of racial types , traditions , etc. -RRB- ; the '' Slave Trade '' ; '' European Settlers '' ; '' Mis - sionaries '' ; '' Botany '' ; Zoology '' ; '' The Na - tives '' ; '' Languages . ''

		Much detailed infor - mation , mainly scientific , is contained in the Appendices to the several chapters .

		The au - thor 's turn for scientific pursuits and political enterprises is coupled with an artist 's sense of the beauties of nature and an artist 's delight in depicting them .

		This dualism of tempera - ment , if we may so style it , lends his book its pe - culiar character .

		The volume reveals by turns the man of sensibility , and the man of hard facts .

		It seems as if Sir
Harry	PERSON	were possessed alternately of the spirit of
Michelet	PERSON	, and the spirit of '' Mr.
Gradgrind	PERSON	. ''

		Of his pictorial style a set scene or two from his opening pano - rama of Central African scenery may serve as examples . ''

		A steadily flowing river .

		In the middle of the stream an islet of very green grass , so lush and 90 thick that there are no bright lights or sharp shadows simply a great splodge of rich green in the middle of the shining water which reflects principally the whitish - blue of the sky ; though this general tint becomes opal - ine and lovely as mother-of-pearl , owing to the swirling of the current and the red-gold color of the concealed sand-banks which in shallow places permeates the reflec - tions .

		Near to the right side of the grass islet separ - ated only by a narrow mauve-tinted band of water is a sand - bank that has been uncovered , and on this stands a flock of perhaps three dozen small white egrets closely packed , momentarily immoveable , and all stiffly regard - ant of the approaching steamer , each bird with a gen - eral similarity of outline almost Egyptian in its monot - onous repetition .

		The steamer approaches a little nearer , and the birds rise from the sand-bank with a loose flapping flight and strew themselves over the land - scape like a shower of large white petals ... The afternoon is well advanced , and in the eastern sky , which is a warm pinkish blue , the full moon has already risen and hangs there a yellow - white shield with no radiance .

		On the opposite bank of the river to the palm trees is a clump of tropical forest of the richest greeu with purple shadows , lovely and seductive in its warm tints under the rays of the late afternoon sun ... Tiny king - fishers of purple - blue and chestnut-orange flit through the dark net-work of gnarled trunks , and deep in this recess of shade small night-herons and bitterns stand bolt upright , so confident of their invisibility against a back-ground of brown and grey that they do not move even when the steamer passes so close by them as to brush against the tangle of convolvulus and knock down sycamore figs from the glossy-leaved , many-rooted fig trees . ''

		The following transports us to the moon-lit depths of a Hyphasne palm forest . ''

		... Each palm is surmounted by a graceful crown of fan-shaped leaves in an almost symmetrical oval mass , radiating from the summit as from a centre .

		The fruit which is clustered thickly on racemes is seen by daylight a bright chestnut brown and the size of a
Jaffa	LOCATION	orange .

		This brown husk covering an ivory nut is faintly sweet to the taste and is adored by elephants .

		It is on that account that I have brought you here to see with the eye of the spirit a herd of these survivors of past geological epochs .

		Somehow or other it seems more fitting that we should see the wild elephant by moonlight at this present day .

		He is like a ghost revisiting the glimpses of the moon this huge grey bulk , wrinkled even in babyhood , with his monstrous nose , his monstrous ears and his extravagant incisor 180 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, teeth ... Now you hear the noise they make an occasional reverberating rattle through the proboscis as they examine objects on the ground half seriously , half playfully ; and the swishing they make as they pass through the herbage ; or the rustle of branches which are being plucked to be eaten .

		But they are chiefly bent on the ginger-bread nuts of the palms and to attain these , where they hang out of reach , they will pause occasionally to butt the palm trees with their flattened foreheads .

		The dried stems and the dead fronds crash down before this jarring blow .

		The elephants pause every now and then in their feasting , the mothers to suckle their little ones , a huge bull to caress a young female with his twining trunk , or the childless cows to make semblance of fighting , and the half-grown young to chase each other with shrill trumpetings .

		Before the first pale pink light of early dawn the moonlight seems an unreality .

		In a few minutes the moon is no more luminous than a round of dirty paper and with the yel - low radiance of day the elephants cease their gambol - lings and feasting , form into line , and swing into one of those long marches which will carry them over sixty miles of forest , plain and mountain to the next halting - place in their seeming-purposeful journey . ''

		British
Central Africa	LOCATION	is a well-wooded coun - try , especially in the
Nyasa	LOCATION	province , though here and there on the line of water parting between the river systems there are compara - tively barren spots , where the trees are poor and scrubby and the plants grow in scattered tufts .

		There is nowhere any large unbroken area of the dense tropical forest characteristic of
Western Africa	LOCATION	; but in the moister districts there are occasional patches of woodland quite West-African in character , and containing , moreover , certain trees , birds , and mammals hitherto believed to be peculiar to that region .

		From this and other facts the author is led to surmise that `` the whole of
Africa	LOCATION	was once covered with more or less dense forest , but that the climate in the eastern half being drier than in the west , the ravages of the bush fires started by man have made greater headway than the reparatory influence of nature . ''

		The geology of the country seems to be relatively simple .

		The commonest formation is a mixture of met - amorphic rocks , grauwacke , clay - slates , gneiss and schists .

		The principal mountain ranges are mostly granite .

		In the stream valleys and depressions , especially in the
Nyasaland	LOCATION	prov - inces , is found the black `` cotton '' soil -LRB- a deposit of the shells of molluscs mixed with black vegetable earth -RRB- , so highly valued in
India	LOCATION	, and which is usually extremely rich for cultivation .

		In the sandstone formation of the
West Shire	LOCATION	district and round the northern half of
Nyasa	LOCATION	, coal is found a little shaley on the surface , but probably overlying good combustible coal .

		As to gold , to the
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	adventurer driven by the auri sacra fames , British Central Africa appears to hold out -LRB- as yet -RRB- no especially glittering bait .

		`` In the
Marimba	ORGANIZATION	and Central Angoniland districts , also in the mountains of the
West Nyasa	LOCATION	coast region , and in parts of the
Shire Highlands	LOCATION	, a gold-beariug quartz exists .

		Alluvial gold is reported to exist on the Northern Angoni plateau , in the
West Nyasa	LOCATION	district , and at the head-waters of the
River Bua	LOCATION	, just within the Protectorate .

		In the valleys of the rivers flowing south to the Zambesi -LRB- in
Mpezeni	LOCATION	's country -RRB- gold really does exist , and was worked at Misale by the half-caste Portugese in the last , and in part of the present cent - ury .

		Although there are many reports that payable gold has been found in the rock , which only needs the requisite machinery to crush out , at anything from 10 dwts .

		to 1 oz .

		per ton , no conclusive evidence has yet been offered to support these statements by specimens which can be submitted to analysis . ''

		In the interesting chapter on '' Missionaries '' the author discusses in a very candid , and , as he claims , impartial way the character and value of missionary work in
Central Africa	LOCATION	.

		Im - primis he declares that '' No person who desires to make a truthful statement would deny the great good effected by missionary enterprise '' in that country .

		This good appears to him , as we gather , to be mainly of the secular and practical kind the essentially religious re - sults of missionary labor -LRB- as indicated by the numbers of real converts made -RRB- being rela - tively small .

		Hence , it seems probable to Sir
Harry	PERSON	that when the history of the great Afri - can states of the future comes to be written the early missionary will figure therein prim - arily as the temporal , rather than the spiritual , guide of the natives , and as the bearer of use - ful European arts and handicrafts to a be - nighted continent .

		All of which , one may suggest in passing , will depend largely upon the mental attitude of the future historian and his generation toward the general question in - volved .

		Says the author : '' The pioneering propagandist will assume -LSB- in fu - ture history -RSB- somewhat of the character of a Quetzal - coatl one of those strange half-mythical personal - ities which figure in the legends of old American empires ; the beneficent being who introduced arts and manufactures , implements of husbandry , edible fruits , medical drugs , cereals , domestic animals .

		... It is they -LRB- the missionaries -RRB- too who in many cases have first taught the natives carpentry , joinery , masonry , tailor - ing , cobbling , engineering , bookkeeping , printing , and European cookery ; to say nothing of reading , writing , arithmetic , and a smattering of general knowledge ... At the
Government	ORGANIZATION	press at
Zomba	LOCATION	there is but one European superintendent all the other printers being mission-trained natives .

		Most of the telegraph stations are entirely worked by negro telegraph clerks also de - rived from the missions . ''

		We are to conclude , then , that the verdict of the impartial observer of missionary work

		THE DIAL 181 in
Central Africa	LOCATION	must be almost wholly in its favor .

		The author finds , nevertheless , that there exists in some quarters a bitter prejudice against the missionaries , and a tendency to deny or to disparage their services .

		The causes of this feeling , he concludes , are two : '' -LRB- 1 -RRB- The Cant which , by some unaccountable fatal - ity , seems to be inseparably connected with missionary work , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- the arrogant demeanor often assumed by missionaries toward men who are not of their man - ner of thought and practice , though not necessarily men of evil life . ''

		Sir
Harry	PERSON	's charges as to '' cant '' and '' ar - rogant demeanor '' are doubtless not altogether ill-founded in a certain proportion of individual cases ; but it will probably be objected that in thus broadly explaining the existence of the prejudice in question he takes account only of the ways and character of those who are the objects of it , without at all troubling himself to look into the ways and character of those who harbor it ; and that an explanation thus grounded is at best only half an explanation .

		To fully understand why the Central African missionaries are disliked '' in some quarters , '' and to decide fairly just how much or how little they are themselves to blame for it , we must first know who it is that dislikes them .

		Certain incidental admissions of our author 's seem to throw a little light on this point .

		He remarks , apropos of the alleged '' arrogant de - meanor '' of the missionaries , that the average European -LRB- lay -RRB- pioneers are not '' very credit - able specimens of mankind . ''

		They are aggressively ungodly , they put no check on their lusts ; released from the restraints of civiliza - tion and the terror of ' what people may say , ' they are capable of almost any degree of wickedness . ''

		Such being the character of a large contin - gent of the white population of British
Central Africa	LOCATION	, the prejudice there against missionaries seems explicable on other grounds than those given by Sir
Harry	PERSON	.

		The missionary is not likely to be a universally popular man in a community largely made up of '' aggressively ungodly '' people , to whom his presence is a restraint and his ways are a rebuke and to whom , moreover , all profession of piety is '' cant , '' and who would naturally resent a decent attitude of official aloofness from loose ways and loose company as savoring of '' arrogant demeanor '' and the spiritual conceit of the '' unco guid . ''

		In point of fact , there is , as it seems to us , a fundamental rivalry between the African missionaries and the army of self-seek - ing or merely nomadic adventurers now stream - ing thither in the wake of the Rhodeses ,
Jame	PERSON	- sons , and Barnatos .

		What dreams of future theocratic states in
Africa	LOCATION	the more ambitious missionaries may not unreasonably have cher - ished before the tide of European invasion set in , we do not know ; but there is evidently still a clash of aims and ideals between the mis - sionaries and the political agents who are wrangling over and parcelling out the land and , incidentally , shoving aside or shooting down the original holders of it .

		Even the godly Boer , trusting in providence and his rifle , treats the black man as a mere beast of burden .

		In fine , to the missionary
Africa	LOCATION	is primarily the Lord 's vineyard where the Lord 's work is to be done ; to almost everybody else who goes out there it is a vast field for political and commercial exploitation , where a good deal of even devil 's work may be done , if only the use - ful end is likely to be secured thereby .

		The African must , and should , give way before the '' Africander . ''

		But it is in the meantime rather hard for the missionary to see his once special province overrun and his pious toil among the heathen threatened with undoing by industrial civilization 's advance guard of largely graceless adventurers , who have little of civilization to bestow upon the black man save the contagion of its vices .

		The volume is an exceptionally handsome one , profusely and beautifully illustrated from drawings by the author and from photographs .

		Sir
Harry	PERSON	's experiences of things African is perhaps more thorough and many-sided than that of any other living authority ; and the reader who is interested in things African is not likely to find a dull or an uninstructive page in his book .

		E. G. J. ART AND LIFE .

		* The relation of literature to life or , one might as well say , of art to life is a very important question .

		A question it has been since Aristotle , and a question it will remain until someone has either genius enough to divine the adequate answer or scholarship enough to work the answer out .

		And it is important , because nowadays art is becoming a very great possibility in life , a possibility which if rightly used may amount to much .

New York	LOCATION	:
Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	.

		182 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, the great circumstances which comes some - how to his notice is infallibly Art .

		Religion , Learning , Science , Politics ,
Society	ORGANIZATION	, Work , Athletics , each one of these , of varying kind and in varying degree , is one of the things that go to make up the surrounding of circumstance wherein he developes .

		Each may help him to make of himself what he does make of himself .

		Art of some kind is as universal as these other circumstances , and is said by many to be as useful , if one can avail oneself of it .

		An enor - mous literature is at everybody 's command ; the theatre is open to very many ; music is only a little less accessible , and in some forms is even more accessible ; pictures are not so uni - versal , but still are not uncommon ; statues may be found by the earnest seeker , and here and there one sees architecture .

		Nobody can entirely avoid art , and nobody tries to do so .

		Everybody has some dealings with art .

		How many make it a thing of real good to them ?

		How many are really influenced by it ?

		The novel is at present the most omnipresent form of literature .

		It is a prevalent opinion that novel-reading may have bad results .

		But except in one direction , few seem to imagine that novel-reading may have good results .

		That one direction points toward direct teach - ing conveyed by fiction .

		Without discussing the real value of novels with a purpose , we may ask , Are there many novel-readers who are aware that they may be influenced , if they choose , by the novel as literature ?

		There are in our country numerous literary clubs .

		In how many of them is literature re - garded as a moulding power , and in how many is it conceived as a repository of facts ?

		Some literary clubs make literature a much more interesting and amusing thing than it was be - fore ; some show that it will reward the earnest student with a delightful form of mental exer - cise ; and we hope that there are some that give their members the idea that literature may , if they choose , be a matter of vital and eternal service to them .

		Our colleges and universities , without ex - ception , maintain professors of literature .

		Some of these professors have succeeded in making it clear that modern literature contains as many matters which may be made the sub - ject of scholarly research as do the classics .

		Others have succeeded in arousing in their students a sort of high-pitched idealism which is fascinating in college , although sometimes forgotten when once out of it .

		Is there more than one , most unacademic of professors that he is , whose students can not escape from the consciousness that literature may be the breath of life to the spirit ?

		We think that Americans are , as a people , practical enough to make some use of litera - ture , if they see that it can be of use in the everyday solutions of the problems of living .

		We think that literature is nothing to them because they have no idea of what it may be .

		We think it the duty of our chief literary critics to tell them the truth on this subject .

		The three great English critics of our gen - eration ,
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	,
Walter Pater	PERSON	,
John luiskin	PERSON	, had each his theory on this matter , definite enough to be understood without great difficulty .

		Even the critics of secondary rank ,
John Addington Symonds	PERSON	,
Vernon Lee	PERSON	,
Fred	PERSON	- eric
Harrison	PERSON	, are continually revolving the question .

		Being men of letters and not scien - tists , they do not always go about the business in the most direct and systematic manner ; still , they go about it seriously in ways of their own .

		It is a fault of American criticism that it has not as yet had very much to say upon the subject .

		But now we have two volumes by two of our best-known essayists , which at first sight would seem to deal with the matter .

		It may be hypercritical to remark , first , that neither of the books does deal very fully with the matter .

		Mr.
Warner	PERSON	's volume is a collec - tion of essays named from the first essay : the others '' have been selected for their general relation to the theme of the title essay , that is to say , the connection between our literary , edu - cational , and social progress . ''

		Colonel Hig - ginson 's collection is not a collection of '' Essays on Literature and Life , '' but of some essays on literature and other essays on life or some as - pect of it .

		`` The Relation of Literature to Life , '' although we have spoken of it as a question , is really a very vague matter , and may include almost anything .

		Literature may be an effect of Life : so Taine regarded it .

		It may also be regarded as a cause , or an influence : that is the view that we have spoken of above , and that is the point Mr.
Warner	PERSON	considers in his first essay and elsewhere .

		His conclusion hardly satisfies us .

		Literature , he points out , is wrongly regarded by the multitude as a thing apart from life -LRB- p. 19 -RRB- ; it is really , how - ever -LRB- p. 22 -RRB- , a thing of immense value to everyone .

		So far , there is nothing to dispute ; but why is poetry , literature , art , of value to everyone ?

		Because , says Mr.
Warner	PERSON	, it is '' not merely the comfort of the refined and
1897	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 183 the delight of the educated ; it is the alleviator of poverty , the pleasure-ground of the igno - rant , the bright spot in the most dreary pil - grimage '' -LRB- p. 28 -RRB- : it is a matter '' of present enjoyment '' -LRB- p. 49 -RRB- or of future , its main ob - ject is to entertain -LRB- p. 151 -RRB- , to lift the burdens of life by taking us for a time out of our hum - drum and perhaps sordid condition : it is the help and solace of the many -LRB- p. 117 -RRB- .

		This seems to be Mr.
Warner	PERSON	's main opinion : as will be noticed , it is expressed in several places .

		We regard it as rather a commonplace idea ; it has long been familiar , and it does not in itself settle anything .

		For the fact is that some people enjoy good literature and more enjoy bad literature .

		What is really needed is something that will show why good literature is a better solace than bad .

		But if art be a solace in the hardships of life , how can we be satisfied to say that the value of any genuine piece of literature is in '' the enlargement of the mind to a conception of the life and devel - opment of the race '' -LRB- p. 293 -RRB- ?

		Is '' enlarge - ment of the mind '' necessarily '' a solace '' amid the hardships of life ?

		Is it not the next step which is the step really worth while ?

		Why not get at the real difficulty ?

		Why content oneself with illustrating views that have already been often illustrated ?

		We do not think that Mr.
Warner	PERSON	solves the question when he ad - vises that a taste for good literature be incul - cated in the common schools .

		The trouble is that the youthful mind does not always take naturally to good literature , and the average common-school teacher is not always able to show that good literature is something really to be desired .

		Take it all in all , although we have only touched the central point , Mr. War - ner does not do much toward making clear what part literature must have in life : what he says has been said before , and does not touch the really difficult point .

		Colonel
Higginson	PERSON	does not give us even as much help as Mr.
Warner	PERSON	, the reason being , as we have indicated , that he has not anywhere made any effort to deal with the subject indi - cated by the title of his book .

		He has merely collected a number of his recent essays and given them a title which seemed to include them all , as it would include almost every - thing else .

		The essays are rather like good mellow winter apples ; and we have enjoyed them .

		We disagree with
Colonel Higginson	PERSON	's apparent view that literature is chiefly valuable as a mine of unfamiliar quotations ; but that is a minor detail .

		We think that everybody will like to read the book , and that no one will gain from it many ideas on the connection between literature and life .

		It is a pity , but neither of these books really addresses itself to what is an important matter , and a matter which they seem to affect to deal with .

		They bring us no farther on the way .

		They will be read with interest , and soon for - gotten ; for though each is the work of a man of great talent , neither is a book to be taken seriously .

		Being lightly written , they will be lightly read .

		184 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, since accumulated , many must be passed over with - out mention , but there remain a score or more that shall receive some attention .

		By virtue of both its subject and its excellence , `` The Builders and Other Poems , '' by the Rev.
Henry Van Dyke	PERSON	, is entitled to the first place in the American section of the present survey .

		Mr.
Van Dyke	PERSON	can lay no claim to great distinction among the host of our minor poets , but a great occasion sometimes lifts a man above his natural height , and the sesquicen - tennial celebration of
Princeton University	ORGANIZATION	proved such an occasion for this sincere and large-souled divine .

		The '' Ode '' which he recited upon that occasion is a fine example of this academic sort of composition , and has a considerable inherent value .

		One of its noblest passages is the following : `` Softly , my harp , and let me lay the touch Of silence on these rudely clanging strings ; For he who sings Even of noble conflicts overmuch .

		Loses the inward sense of better things ; And he who makes a boast Of knowledge , darkens that which counts the most , The insight of a wise humility That reverently adores what none can see .

		The glory of our life below Comes not from what we do , or what we know , But dwells forevermore in what we are .

		There is an architecture grander far Than all the fortresses of war , More inextinguishably bright Than learning 's lonely towers of light , Framing its walls of faith and hope and love In deathless souls of men , it lifts above The frailty of our earthly home An everlasting dome ; The sanctuary of the human host , The living triumph of the Holy Ghost . ''

		The publication of this poem has given the author occasion also to collect some half-hundred pages of random verse , obviously written with no set pur - pose of becoming a poet , but merely as the expres - sion of some insistent mood or striking phase of natural beauty .

		It is all very pleasing and in perfect good taste , although it never becomes particularly impressive .

		It is such verse as almost any cultured thinker of sincere life and high ideals may pro- duce from time to time , and for which life is at least none the worse , either for the writer or his audience .

		Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	's new volume is entitled '' For the Country , '' and includes poems -LRB- some old and some new -RRB- written for patriotic occasions and in memory of our great soldiers .

		It `` is devoted to the idea of a vital nationality , and a citizenship as self - sacrificing and courageous in peace as in war . ''

		The American public knows well how unflinchingly Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	has stood for these civic ideals , and his verse is the refined expression of a life that has been in the best sense one of service .

		We some - times wish that Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	's metres were less un - tamed , and that he would not try so many experi - ments in stanzaic form , but he always has some - thing to say , and his voice is urged by a genuine lyrical impulse .

		That when far from home he is not forgetful of his native land is evidenced by these verses from '' A
Winter	DATE	Twilight in
Provence	LOCATION	, '' a poem written at the beginning of last year . ''

		Dear country mine !

		far in that viewless west , And ocean-warded , strife thou too hast known ; But may thy sun hereafter bloodless shine , And may thy way be onward without wrath , And upward on no carcase of the slain ; And if thou smitest , let it be for peace And justice not in hate , or pride , or lust Of empire .

		Mayst thou ever be , O land !

		Noble and pure as thou art free and strong : So shalt thon lift a light for all the world And for all time , and bring the Age of Peace . ''

		It is not difficult to read between the lines of this poem dated just at the time of the amazing out - burst of jingoism that seemed for a moment to threaten a fratricidal war between the two nations that , of all nations in the world , have the deepest reasons for living in amity and in the common possession of a great historical past .

		The widow of the late
Timothy Otis Paine	PERSON	has published a thin volume of selections from his poems which , by their unaffected simplicity and their closeness to the heart of nature , at once dis - arm criticism and make to their readers an appeal of which more elaborate verse often fails .

		There is something very winsome about this description of `` The Evening Primrose , '' for example .

		`` The primrose blooms at eventide .

		And , where I go , the highway side It lights up with its yellow blow : What else it does I do not know , Except , all day , and , until blowed , The bud is gray , with slight perfume , Till eve unfold a clean sweet bloom . ''

		That keenness of observation which , as the prefa - tory memoir tells us , '' caught the reflection of a violet in the clear eyes of a grazing cow , '' is re - vealed in many a pretty versicle of this collection .

		We are sometimes reminded of
Emily Dickinson	PERSON	, as in the two quatrains called '' Good Work . '' ''

		Who praised when sun , moon , star , Great earth , and sea spread far Were made ?

		But yet what worth From laboring sun , sea , earth ! ''

		Put work enough in all Thon doest , great or small , And let the ages tell How much thou didst , and well . ''

		Still more frequent are the suggestions of Emer - son , with whom the author had no slight spiritual kinship on the mystical or `` transcendental '' side .

		His life was that of a Swedenborgian minister and a scholar in the ancient tongues .

		The study of
Solomon 's Temple	ORGANIZATION	and the Egyptian '' Book of the Dead '' were to him more serious preoccupations than the phenomena of modern life could afford , and he once wrote that if he knew anything , it was '
Ezekiel	PERSON	's heart . ''

		He was born in
1824	DATE	, lived his adult life as a pastor in
East Bridgewater	LOCATION	,
Massa	PERSON	- chusetts , and died a year or two ago .

		Mr.
John James Piatt	PERSON	's volume of verse , mostly occasional , has for its leading features two odes ,
1897	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 185 one for the
Cleveland	LOCATION	Centennial , the other for the dedication of the
Cincinnati Music Hall	ORGANIZATION	.

		We make an extract from the latter : '' Look , what high guests attend our happy rite , With earth-woven wreaths but sphere-enchanted faces , The Masters of Delight !

		First he , of the elder days , Whom the great organ owns With its vast-bosomed , earth shaking , heaven-reaching tones -LRB- Let the proud servant throb his loftiest praise ! -RRB-

		.

		Next he , who built the mighty symphonies , One for each muse , who , chaunting joy and peace , Thrills us with awe and yearning infinite , Picturing divine repose , love 's world - embracing height !

		Then he , whose noblest strain Brings Orpheus back to quicken earth again , To conquer darkness and the dread under-powers , Charming lost love from the deep doors of hell , And lo , the choral master , highest in fame -LRB- A thousand voices lift to greet him well -RRB- , Who breathes sure faith through these frail hearts of ours !

		And many another well - beloved name , Ay , many another , comes with these , Star-like , with spheral harmonies : Welcome each and all , To our festal
Hall	PERSON	, Long be its music - lifted dome For their abiding souls the transient home . ''

		Mr.
Buckham	PERSON	's '' The Heart of Life '' is a volume of the tasteful '' Oaten Stops '' series .

		It is a collec - tion of simple lyrics of nature , and of the everyday moods of life , pretty and facile , but not striking .

		The following is a favorable example : '' Out of the bosom of God comes the day , Flood of the tenderness nothing can stay ; Love that up-springing sets the world singing , Steeples a - shine and the silver bells ringing .

		Infinite motion of infinite ocean , Light but the symbol that broadens for aye , Out of the bosom of God comes the day . ''

		The above remarks may be repeated in the case of Mr.
Urmy	PERSON	's '' Vintage of Verse , '' except that his nature-lyrics are given the local coloring of the
Pacific	LOCATION	coast .

		One stanza will do as well as a score . ''

		The sun has set , and evening skies Begin , like rosebuds , to unfold , While on the distant mountain-tops Still linger faint , stray gleams of gold , Like kisses pressed by angel lips Or touches of God 's finger-tips . ''

		There is no offense in such verse , and likewise no strength .

		It is merely the echo of a great voice reflected a hundred times or more .

		There is some measure of strength , albeit fitfully displayed , and some command of the deeper harmo - nies of rythmical utterance in the poems modestly entitled '' Fugitive Lines , '' by Mr.
Henry Jerome Stockard	PERSON	.

		The finer qualities of his verse are dis - played in the sonnets , as well as in such a lyric as ''
Fallida Mors	PERSON	, '' from which we quote a stanza . ''

		For thon dost come a friend , Or if thou shudder in with cerements stoled , Or sweep swart as a Memphian King , or bend An angel fair as
Titian e'er	ORGANIZATION	did feign , For thou dost come a friend , since thou wilt hold
Nepenthe	ORGANIZATION	for life 's pain Unto my lips , and round me fold , Like some rich garment , peace that shall not end , While days and months and years be onward rolled . ''

		Mr.
Robert W. Chambers	PERSON	has written some rol - licking songs '' With the Band , '' so suggestive of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's barrack-room echoes that the reader did not need to be reminded of the source of inspi - ration by a piece directly inscribed to the English poet .

		Since this piece is one of the best in the volume , we must quote from it . ''

		May that blessed day come early ,
Tommy A.	PERSON	, When the British nation learns That it 's silly to be surly .

		Not a Boy in Blue but yearns ,
Tommy A.	PERSON	,

Tommy A.	PERSON	'' Other pieces are more suggestive of Mr.
Bret Harte	PERSON	-LRB- from whom Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	himself really derives -RRB- , and the famous ballad of the '' Heathen Chinee '' is provided with a not unworthy counterpart in the tale of '' A Man from
Noo York	LOCATION	, '' who was about as guileless as Ah Sin . ''

		Sa-ay , He said that he did n't know poker , An ' he swore that he did n't drink rum ; Which , stranger , I '11 state I 'm no soaker ,
Leastways	LOCATION	, I ` in no all-around-bum .

		An ' he said that he did n't like ladies , Yet I seen him smile twice at my Anne ; He was young so he said and afraid his Simplicity shocked me !

		Oh , damn 1 An ' he feared some nefarious man Might play him a game of flim-flam , If be pushed the door , An ' walked on the floor , Where the wicked men rush the can . ''

		The rest of this moving tale may easily be imagined .

		We should like to quote from u The
Texas Rangers	ORGANIZATION	, '' which is in the same vein , but space forbids . ''

		The Visit to West Point '' gives a barrack-room view of the meddlesome legislator much like the inside views of Parliamentary commissions which Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	has given us with such telling effect .

		A second sec - tion of this volume is more serious , and has touches of an art not unlike Mr.
Dobson	PERSON	's .

		Its prevailing note , however , is less restrained , being well illus - trated by the stanzas entitled `` The Worm Turns . ''

		186 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, `` While I ` ra tugging my mustache , Leaning on the window-sash , In the garden , you , below , Decked in ribbon , lace , and bow ,
Promenade	LOCATION	, six men in tow . ''

		Men who hang upon your lips , Bend above your finger-tips ; Each his humble tribute pays ,
Litts	PERSON	to you his ardent gaze , Turning your small head with praise . ''

		You are pleased to treat with scorn Men , as though beneath you born .

		You believe it when we say : ' Man is born but to obey !

		You are made of finer clay . ' '' '

		Man is built from common dirt , Scarcely fit to touch your skirt !

		Woman is his better half , Better angel !

		queen !

		his staff ! '

		Pray excuse me while I laugh .

		`` If we call you ` angel , ' ` queen , ' Take it simply that we mean WE are KINGS !

		Oh , do n't yon know , You 're not really angels though , Till Saint
Peter	PERSON	tells you so ? ''

		`` At the Gates of Song , '' by Mr.
Lloyd Mifflin	PERSON	, is a collection of one hundred and fifty sonnets , selected , so the author tells us , from about twice that number .

		Mr.
Mifflin	PERSON	is evidently a facile ver - sifier , for the present volume is accompanied by a notice of three other books of poems '' now in course of publication . ''

		Although these sonnets bear a modest title , it is evident that their author takes himself very seriously .

		He presents the public with his portrait as well as his poems , and , after remark - ing upon the difficulties of the sonnet-form , adds that '' he is proud in the consciousness that if he has added nothing to the lustre of that narrow and intricate domain of literature , at least he has not tarnished it with anything indecorous and unseemly . ''

		Both of the foregoing claims may well enough be allowed , for the sonnets -LRB- except for an occasional liberty taken of set purpose with the structure -RRB- are conspicuously correct in form , well-balanced , smooth - sounding , and each the expression of a definite thought .

		But with all this technical correctness , they are somehow lacking in the power to thrill or even deeply to stir the reader .

		A good typical ex - ample is '' Build Thou Thy Temples . '' ''

		Reward lies in the work , not in the eye Nor voice of critic .

		Whether in the mart , Or on the Heliconian hills apart .

		Toil at thy temples builded in the sky .

		Dreams are , in sooth , the only verity .

		The world with scorn may lacerate thy heart Insult with praise too late ... Delve at thine Art : Beauty shall never unremembered die .

		`` The sculptor , unillustrious and alone , Pent in the still seclusion of his room ,
Carves	LOCATION	, through the vexed vicissitude of years , Some marvel in
Carrara	LOCATION	, but the stone Men heed not till it stand above his tomb The cold commemoration of his tears . ''

		One may find no fault with such work as this .

		It is truly noble in sentiment , and excellently put .

		Only and this is the feeling with which we have read Mr.
Mifllin	PERSON	's work throughout it lacks the imaginative vision ; its ideas have long been stereo - typed ; and its phrasing rarely escapes from the conventional mould .

		Mr.
Henry Hanby Hay	PERSON	, whose '' Created Gold , '' published some time ago , we were able to greet with a qualified kind of praise , now approaches the public with a new volume , '' Trumpets and Shawms . ''

		Trumpets we know , but we are a little uncertain about shawms .

		The author calls them '' dulcet , '' and compares them with gentle bells and tinkling rills .

		We have not found much that is dulcet in the volume , but the blaring quality is very evident .

		Mr.
Hay	PERSON	is a Manxman , it seems , and has persuaded that other Manxman , Mr.
Hall Caine	PERSON	, to write an introduction for the volume .

		We are told that the poet '' has given us the very color and scent of our lovely and beloved little island . ''

		A judgment passed by so competent an authority must be allowed , although the Manx influence is less noticeable than the influence of the man
Robert Browning	PERSON	, who has evidently been Mr.
Hay	PERSON	's model .

		Sometimes he succeeds in giving us a very fair imitation of the sort of dramatic idyl or monologue that
Browning	PERSON	produced so readily .

		`` The Court Awards It , '' being Shylock 's soliloquy the day after the trial , is a case in point .

		`` Oh , dog !

		the opportunity was thine To face the crowd , which , though it hated , feared ; And take the guilty flesh with even hand , And show their justice what their justice is !

		Wail not for that , but rather tell thyself The cavilling court had birthed one cavil more , A hundred hands had plucked away thy steel ; Thou might ` st not .

		Never Jew found Christian just .

		Oh , had I dared to dash the court aside .

		Under the fifth rib strike , and end it all !

		And do as they do , say the man was cursed , And then proceed to execute the curse . ''

		Mr.
Hay	PERSON	's qualities , and their defects , may be well illustrated by the closing lines of '' A Vestal . ''

		The climax of the gladiatorial combat has been reached , and , '' Dread stillness the horror entrances , All pause for the signal of death , While a
Vestal	LOCATION	, with dead , pallid glances Looks down and indraws her calm breath : Death broods o'er the ebony ocean , Men gazing and fearing , but dumb ; Till the
Vestal	LOCATION	, sans warmth or emotion , Points down to the earth with her thumb .

		All are gone -LRB- and the carcass is somewhere -RRB- , The Csesar to revel and shame , While the Virgin , slow pallid and dumb fair , Preserves the perpetual flame . ''

		Mr.
Lessor	PERSON	's '' Echoes of Halcyon Days , '' we learn , date from ten or more years ago , when the author , too , dwelt in
Arcadia	LOCATION	.

		Their belated pub - lication is influenced '' partly by the promptings of perhaps over-zealous friends , partly by the author 's parental desire to congregate the mental offspring of a period antedating his embarkation on the ' bubble , toil , and trouble ' of a professional career . ''

		That career , he takes pains to inform us , has borne '' literary fruit in the form of a treatise on ' The Historical Development of the Jury System . ' ''

		We
1897	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 187 do not know that treatise , but we trust that it is lucid and worthy of its high theme .

		The '' Echoes , '' however , have been wafted to our ears , and the author 's confession of '' long addiction to the philos - ophy of stoicism '' emboldens us to say that they are not remarkable .

		We quote from the touching and tragic tale of ''
Lucian	PERSON	and
Lydia	PERSON	. '' ''

		As his blood was ebbing fast and faster ,
Lucian	PERSON	oped his glazing : eyes once more , Turned a mute curse on the cruel master Angels to the seat of judgment bore : Then one long look on his loving maiden Of eternal hope that one look said : And his soul , of earthly woes unladen , From his mangled body upward fled . ''

		If any more '' echoes of halcyon days '' yet linger in Mr.
Lessor	PERSON	's memory , we trust that he will sup - press them .

		The law is an excellent profession , and , without knowing anything of Mr.
Lessor	PERSON	's professional career , we have no hesitation in saying that his chances of shining as a legal luminary are considerably greater than his chances of success in wooing the fickle muse .

		We get back into the domain of true poetry when we turn to the exquisite volume which bears the honored name of Mrs.
Harriet Prescott Spofford	PERSON	.

		Here is imagination and to spare ; here also are chastened thought and melodious utterance .

		We should like to quote at length from the varied con - tents of this collection , but must remain content with a single sonnet . ''

		When in the dark of some despairing dream Sorrow has all her will with me , and ease Is full forgotten , through her dear degrees Steals Music , beckoning with a hand supreme For me to follow .

		Straight I see the gleam Where the winds dip them in the far bright seas That roll and break about the Hebrides , See white wings flash and hear the sea-birds scream . ''

		Or it may be in palace gardens falls The moonlight on white roses , where the swell Of one great lover 's heart in passion calls To deeps in other hearts .

		And , listening , well I know , while sink my slow dissolving walls , So Music lured Eurydice from hell . ''

		This poem is peculiarly typical of Mrs.
Spofford	PERSON	's work , because it is one of several that show her to be no stranger to the message that music bears to the soul .

		Her apprehension of the divinest of the arts is something deeper than the merely conven - tional appreciation of most poets .

		They use musical terminology as a rhetorical adornment merely ; the present writer seeks to give it a real verbal inter - pretation .

		Miss
Ruth Lawrence	PERSON	's sheaf of '' Colonial Verses '' consists of short poems written to accom - pany a series of photographs taken at Mount Ver - non .

		The verses are correct and pretty , embodying a graceful sentiment , but in no way remarkable . ''

		Beneath the Trees '' is a good example . ''

		Beneath the trees at even-glow I wander , meditative , slow , Where courtiers brave with gold and lace Befitting well the stately place , Once gayly sauntered to and fro . ''

		On velvet turf by green hedge-row I picture statesman , scholar , beau , And dainty damsel fair of face , Beneath the trees . ' '

		The rays upon the dial show How swift the deepening shadows grow .

		The noble fathers of our race Are gone , with all their wit and grace , They laid their ashes long ago Beneath the trees . ''

		In Mr.
John Stuart Thomson	PERSON	, we must welcome a worthy accession to the growing choir of
Cana	LOCATION	- dian singers .

		His '' Estabelle and Other Verse '' is a noteworthy production , and gives him an un - doubted right to a place in the group of poets headed by Professor
Roberts	PERSON	, Mr.
Lampmann	PERSON	, and Mr.
W. W. Campbell	PERSON	.

		Our extract may be no more than a single stanza the closing one from the long and beautiful * ' Ode Written in
Autumn	DATE	. '' ''

		Strange suns begin to light the shorter days ; The Indian
summer	DATE	and the harvest moon Give way before the banks of purple haze ; Cicadas pipe at eve their shrilly tune , Bucolics of the melancholy time ; The mower now surveys the low-laid grain , And picks a last belated berry red ; The corn-ricks ' shadows lengthen on the plain ; Soft on the breeze I hear a distant chime Tolling a requiem for th ' untimely dead . ''

		It is remarkable how close to the heart of nature these young Canadian poets contrive to keep .

		They have the faculty of observation minute , accurate , and at the same time sympathetic in a degree quite extraordinary even to-day , and almost unknown in English poetry before
Tennyson	PERSON	opened our eyes .

		Mr.
Thomson	PERSON	's poems are nearly all lyrics of nature , and many of them strike a note of pure and singular beauty .

		By way of interlude between the American and the English section of this survey , we may at this point say a word about a modest booklet of French verse , written by
M. Rene * de Poyen-Bellisle	PERSON	, of the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, and entitled `` Journe'es d' Avril . '

		Je n , ^ cris plua de vergi > says the author , '' Ce sont mes peche 's de jeunesse , Que pour rechauffer mes hivers En vieux grandpere je caresse . ''

		We take the liberty of doubting the exact truth of this observation , and hope to read many more verses by M. de Poyen-Bellisle before he reaches grandfatherly years .

		There are some charming things in the present collection , cameos in the man - ner of Gautier , musings in the manner of Musset , and sonnets of skilful construction .

		One of the shorter pieces is this '' Enigme . '' ''

		II avait dpuise '' tout le possible humain ; Les Empires s ` e ` taient e ` branle 's sons sa main , L' Art s ` dtait enrichi de ses efforts utiles ; Gi See a lui les deserts 4taient beaux et fertiles ; Mais il restait toujonrs petit et me ` content ; Et sans pouvoir trouver , cherchait ; sombre , haletant !

		Puis U n jour il comprit !

		et courbant bas la tSte , Joyeux il murmura : ' Ta volonte '' soit faite ' ! ''

		One of the best things to be found in this volume is 188 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, the really remarkable translation of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's '' When in disgrace with fortune and men 's eyes . ''

		The closing verses are as follows : `` Soudain je pense a toi ; tout rit dans ma pensee Et coimne 1 ` alouette au ciel bleu s ' ^ langant Chante un hyrune d'amour avec le jour naissant ; J'ai bientot oublie ma misere passe * e , C'est que , je t ` ainie tant , que quand je pense a toi Je ne changerai pas mon sort avec un roi ! ''

		Of all the verse evoked by the jubilee of Queen
Victoria	PERSON	, Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's '' Recessional '' has made the deepest impression , and best deserves to be long remembered .

		Probably next in importance to that noble poem is the '' Jubilee Greeting at Spithead to the Men of
Greater Britain	LOCATION	, '' written by Mr.
Theo	PERSON	- dore Watts-Dunton .

		This work , albeit only a thin pamphlet , is also noteworthy as being the first pub - lication of its author in anything that may be called book form .

		The foremost of living English critics , and one of the most notable of living English poets , Mr.
Watts-Dunton	PERSON	has thus far been content with the suffrages of the few who have found him out , who have learned to detect his personality in un - signed pages of `` The Athenaeum , '' or who have treasured up in scrap-book his furtively-appearing sonnets .

		A volume of his '' Poems '' has now been promised us for more than two years past , but we shall not believe in it until it actually lies upon our table .

		The '' Jubilee Greeting '' now published is a poem in twenty-two stanzas , one of which we have selected , not without difficulty , as representative of the whole . ''

		They fought with
England	LOCATION	long ago ; They strove with her whose gate the billows keep ; On Channel chalk they sleep below In caverns of the great North Sea they sleep . '

		Thus soldier , priest , and mariner , ' He said , our guardian angel said , ` shall perish ; My deeps have still a sepulchre For all whom envy or hate shall stir To strike across them strike at
England	LOCATION	, her The billows cherish . ' ''

		The grave austere note of the above excerpt char - acterizes this fine poem throughout .

		The work is fittingly dedicated '' to our great contemporary writer of patriotic poetry ,
Algernon Charles Swin	PERSON	- burne . ''

		Mr.
Francis Thompson	PERSON	's volume of '' New Poems '' is , like its two predecessors , a very Klondike for the gold-hunters of song , and its treasures are almost as difficult of access .

		The public is fairly well informed by this time of Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	's distressing mannerisms , verbal perversities , and wanton obscu - rities of thought .

		It knows also that whoever is prepared to brave hardships in the quest of beauty may often find it , imbedded nugget-like in the rough matrix of Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	's verse .

		Here , for exam - ple , is treasure-trove such as shall reward the dili - gent seeker . ''

		Happiness is the shadow of things past , Which fools still take for that which is to be I And not all foolishly : For all the past , read true , is prophecy , And all the firsts are hauntings of some Last , And all the springs are flash-lights of one
Spring	DATE	.

		Then leaf , and flower , and falless fruit Shall hang together on the unyellowing bough ; And silence shall be Music mute For her surcharged heart . ''

		But to reach this passage he must make his way through a '' discinct nature , '' and over '' coerule pampas of the heavens , '' where '' reel the swift spheres intemperably , '' besides witnessing many other strange sights and sounds .

		Mr.
Watson	PERSON	's '' The Year of Shame '' has been on our shelves so long that it has lost something of its timeliness .

		It consists mainly of sonnets on the Armenian question , including those previously pub - lished in '' The Purple East . ''

		The Bishop of Here - ford contributes an introduction , in which he assures us that '' it is the spirit of Isaiah that is represented in this book of poems . ''

		This is flattering to Mr.
Watson	PERSON	, if not to the prophet .

		But the poet has suf - fered before this from the praises of his injudicious admirers .

		There is real fire in his work , although it blazes up with too furious a rhetoric to produce the deepest impression .

		For example , he calls the Sultan '' Abdul the Damned . ''

		Most poets would have let it go at that , but Mr.
Watson	PERSON	's wrath is unsatisfied , and he continues : '' In a world where cruel deeds abound , The merely damned are legion : with such souls Is not each hollow and cranny of Tophet crammed ?

		Thou with the brightest of hell 's aureoles Dost shine supreme , incomparably crowned , Immortally , beyond all mortals , damned . ''

		This is the mere impotence of wrath .

		Compare these '' Dirffl '' with those of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	, for example , and one gets the difference between froth and freshet , between fire and flame . ''

		So soon is dead indifference come ? ''

		asks Mr.
Watson	PERSON	.

		Yes , and with indifference to the theme of his out - pourings a greatly abated interest in the sonnets themselves .

		Vehemence is one thing , and deep - seated indignation another .

		Mr.
Watson	PERSON	may have had the latter , but he has put only the former into his verse .

		He has written neither Swinburnian '' Dirse '' nor '' Chatiments '' after the manner of Hugo , but merely a set of turgid and overwrought sonnets .

		We should not speak so severely were Mr.
Watson	PERSON	a poet of less pretensions , but he has been so clamorously belauded that it becomes the evident duty of criticism to speak the exact truth about his work .

		He must be measured by higher standards than those usually set for minor poets , since comparison with the greatest has been chal - lenged , if not by him , at least for him by his friends and admirers . ''

		A Shropshire Lad , '' by Mr.
A. E. Housman	PERSON	, is a collection of short poems , extremely simple in diction , which strike a thin but pure lyric note .

		Here is one of them : '' From far , from eve and morning And yon twelve-winded sky , The stuif of life to knit me Blew hither : here am I.
1897	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 189 '' Now for a breath I tarry Nor yet disperse apart .

		Take my hand quick and tell me , What have you in your heart .

		`` Speak now , and I will answer ; How shall I help you , say ; Ere to the wind 's twelve quarters I take my endless way . ''

		Almost equally simple , but now more animated , now informed with a deeper passion , are the poems contained in Mr.
A. C. Benson	PERSON	's new volume .

		Here the author shall be his own critic , and a part of his '' Envoi '' at once illustrate and describe his verse . ''

		I can not sing : as sings the nightingale Frenzied with rapture , big with rich delight , Till lovers lean together , passion-pale , And chide the awestruck silence of the
night	TIME	.

		`` I can not sing as sings the brooding dove , At windless noon , in her high towers of green , A song of deep content , untroubled love , With many a meditative pause between . ''

		But I can sing as sings the prudent bee , As hour by patient hour he goes and comes , Bearing the golden dust from tree to tree , Labours in hope , and as he labours , hums . ''

		Mr.
Benson	PERSON	's poetry is very genuine , and impresses the reader with its sincerity and artistic restraint .

		Mr.
Hilaire Belloc	PERSON	's '' Verses and Sonnets '' are by turns quaint , musical , and passionate .

		The son - nets exhibit his best work , although some of them take great liberties with the form .

		We quote the sestet from '' The Poor of
London	LOCATION	, '' an invocation to the justice of God . ''

		The Poor of Jesus Christ whom no man hears Have called upon your vengeance much too long .

		Wipe out not tears but blood our eyes bleed tears : Come , smite our damned sophistries so strong , That thy rude hammer battering this rude wrong Ring down the abyss of twice ten thousand years . ''

		Mr.
J. S. Fletcher	PERSON	's '' Ballads of Revolt '' are six in number , and make up a very small book indeed .

		They mark with deep irony the contrast between what life really is and what the idealist would have it to be , between the mechanical observance of religion and its innermost spirit .

		Perhaps the most impressive of the ballads is '' The Scapegoat , '' which has for its theme the life of Christ . ''

		Then woke the world with sudden stir , -LRB- Whence came this power our hearts to draw ?

		Call ye this man a carpenter ?

		He is a God ! -RRB-

		they cried in awe . ''

		Ah me , it was no god they hailed , No arbiter of life and death , But a poor man who dared and failed , A carpenter of
Nazareth	LOCATION	. ''

		Failed ?

		Aye , for still the nations bend To their false gods a servile knee , And still the scapegoat finds his end On the dark heights of Calvary . ''

		But here and there upon the sun Some man still fixes dauntless eyes , And says ' Amen !

		It is begun ; Let the new life in me arise ! ' ''

		The similarity of this work to that of Mr.
John Davidson	PERSON	is obvious , and it may be said that Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	does not suffer in the comparison .

MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		An Englishman 's We nave * > & Mr.
G. W. Steevens	PERSON	's instructive studies little book entitled '' The Land of the Dollar '' -LRB-
Dodd	PERSON	-RRB- with pleasure and , we trust , some profit .

		The author is a wide - awake , open-minded Englishman who visited our shores during the progress of the recent president - ial campaign , and his book is a reprint of letters written by him while on the wing through the States , to the
London	LOCATION	'' Daily Mail . ''

		The mental attitude of the average English traveller to
America	LOCATION	is one of amused curiosity .

		He comes to
America	LOCATION	predisposed first of all to laugh ; and he usually laughs his fill at least so long as he remains on this side of the line that divides us from
Canada	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Steevens	PERSON	brought to our shores an abundant stock of curiosity , and a sense of humor by no means deficient .

		But as a traveller he is not primarily the man who laughs .

		His liking for '' Max ` Rell '' is evident ; but he can hardly be said to have taken the Frenchman as his model .

		He came to this country chiefly to study us at close range during the bustle of an exciting political campaign .

		To this end he attended conventions , large and small , local and general ; he watched miles upon miles of political parades , and endured hours upon hours of political oratory ; he heard both candidates speak ; he saw the arrival at
Canton	LOCATION	of one of those aston - ishing `` delegations '' this time one from
Portage County	LOCATION	, '' the finest county in the country , '' as Mr.
McKinley	PERSON	took care to point out with great force in his address ; he witnessed the placarding of the returns , and the subsequent frenzied jubilation of the victors .

		Mr.
Steevens	PERSON	describes all this with some humor , but with an ever-present sense of the real gravity and dignity of the main situation .

		He endeavors to outline clearly for the benefit of his English readers the trend of the looming political , social , and economical issues which must from now on , even at the best of times , haunt the consciousness of the people of this country , and which it only needs a period of `` hard times '' like the one now waning to bring to light with startling distinctness . ''

		Good times '' are now setting in ; and we shall probably go on in the old way for another decade or so mak - ing hay prosperously while the sun shines and taking little or no thought for the morrow .

		But `` hard times '' will recur ; discontent will recur ; the cry for change will recur .

		There will again be -LRB- who can doubt it ? -RRB-

		the ominous confrontation at the polls of candidates representing respectively the class whose interest it is to conserve , and the class whose only seeming chance of salvation it is to pull down .

		The crisis may again be tided over ; but , speaking in the light of current indications , one may fairly say that he would be an optimistic prophet indeed who should predict that it will be averted or its asperities softened by the wise antic - ipatory reforms and concessions of those now in a position to make them .

		Mr.
Steevens	PERSON	is no such prophet , nor indeed does he venture much into 190 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, direct vaticination .

		His view of our national future is not on the whole a sombre one that is , of our ultimate luture .

		If there are storms ahead for us , they will at least purify the air .

		Growing class an - tagonisms , and a widespread conviction that to get dollars is the one end of life these , Mr.
Steevens	PERSON	concludes , are the twin sources of our national peril .

		The lighter topics usually touched upon by the tourist are not neglected in the volume , which is , all in all , much the best of its kind that has come to our notice of late .


Sophia V. Bompiani	PERSON	's brief '' His - The Waldentet .

		tory of the Waldenses '' -LRB- A. .


S. Barnes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is an excellent essay upon the characteristics , chief personages , and events in the history of that most ancient body of religious reformers whose descendants to-day oc - cupy a small part , not more than three hundred square miles , of the Cottian Alps .

		Historians have usually ascribed the organization and faith of the Waldenses to
Peter Waldo	PERSON	, a distinguished preach - er of the twelfth century , but the author accepts rather the traditions of the people themselves , quoting many authorities in support of a much earlier origin .

		It is shown that when the
Paul	PERSON	- icians of
Armenia	LOCATION	, fleeing from the persecutions of the eastern emperors , emigrated to
France	LOCATION	in the
eighth century	DATE	, and there established the sect known as the Albigenses , they found in the Wal - denses , just across the Italian border , a people of similar religious beliefs .

		The traditions of the Waldenses assert that they were driven from southern
Italy	LOCATION	, in the time of the second and third centuries , to the Alpine valleys , where they have since lived .

		About one-third of the book is devoted to this contention for the antiquity of the people , while the remainder , written with unfailing interest , treats of their innumerable persecutions by the Papacy , their ministers , their heroes , their martyrs , and their final attainment of religious freedom in
1848	DATE	.

		In ' * The Novels of
Charles Dickens	PERSON	, '' recently issued in the '' Book - Lover 's Library '' -LRB-
Armstrong	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr.
Fred	PERSON	-
eric G. Kitton	PERSON	has collected a fund of interesting and valuable information concerning the works of a writer whose wonderful popularity seems ever on the increase .

		The growth and development of each of the great novels , the circumstances under which it was produced , the terms of publication , facts re - lating to the illustrators and to famous prototypes of characters in the novels , present whereabouts of the original MSS. , present value of fii > t editions , all this and much more is here set forth in a f re-h and entertaining way .

		The work is interesting alike to the book-collector and to the lover of Dickens -- , and forms a welcome addition to Mr.
Kitton	PERSON	's nu - merous volumes of Diekensiana . ''

		My Father as I Recall Him , '' by Miss
Mamie Dickens	PERSON	-LRB-
Westmin	ORGANIZATION	- ster ,
England	LOCATION	: The
Roxburghe Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is a simple and unpretentious account of the home life of the great novelist , written by his youngest daughter .

		No attempt is made at an elaborate or connected biography , and little that is not already known may be found in the volume .

		But these few slight sketches give us such a charming and intimate pic - ture of Dickens the man that the lover of his works who does not read the little book will have missed a distinct pleasure .

		A manual of our common wild flowers .

		To those who wish to become ac - quainted with our common flowers by an easier method than that pre - sented in the ordinary text-books of botany , the vol - ume by Mrs.
Caroline A. Creevy	PERSON	, entitled '' Flowers of Field , Hill , and Swamp '' -LRB- Harpers -RRB- , may be cor - dially commended .

		The author is an adept in the science she illustrates , and while devising a simple way by which lovers of wild flowers may learn their names and relationships , she has not neglected to dignify her work with an array of curious and well - digested information .

		The plants are classed in groups according to their habitat in low meadows , dry fields , cool woods , or in and near the water .

		About a thousand species belonging to the
Atlantic States	LOCATION	from
New England	LOCATION	to
Florida	LOCATION	, and for the most part to the
Middle States	LOCATION	also , are described .

		The volume is a pleasant supplement to the man - uals of

		-LRB-
Appleton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a volume made doubly attractive by its wealth of illustrations , the work of the author 's clever hand .

		The chapters describe the varied wild life to be met with in tramps along a country road , including flowers , birds , insects , and amphibious .

		The author appears to be interested in the different tribes alike , and to be equally appre - ciative of their respective traits .

		In treating the birds , he makes an attempt to reduce their songs within the limits of our musical scale .

		Such at - tempts are interesting , but as a rule not entirely satisfactory .

		As each bird has some peculiar fashion in the delivery of his song , so each listener seems to have a peculiar experience in hearing it .

		For example , on page 119 Mr.
Mathews	PERSON	states that the phoabe 's strain comprises only two notes , and he writes them with a falling inflection .

		Every phoabe which we have ever heard lisped his several notes with both rising and falling inflection , and his song is so described by most authorities .

		Tfie Dungeons of Old

		THE DIAL 191 ant dates in their respective careers , and thus to bring home to the reader the full force and signifi - cance of the old French proverb , '' Triste comme les portes d ` une prison '' The author seems to be somewhat of an enthusiast on his dismal subject an amateur of historic prisons , as it were ; and he goes into the harrowing details of the architecture of his favorite edifices with evident zest and no little learning . ''

		I have undone , '' he assures us , '' the bolts of nearly all the more celebrated pris - ons of historic

Vincennes	LOCATION	, the
Temple	ORGANIZATION	, the

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		The seventh edition of Mr.
George Haven Putnam	PERSON	's `` Authors and Publishers '' presents a revised text and considerable additional material .

		For those not already familiar with this useful book , we quote from the title - page a description of the contents of this '' manual of suggestions for beginners in literature . ''

		The work comprises , in brief , `` a description of publishing meth - ods and arrangements , directions for the prepara - tion of
MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		for the press , explanations of the details of book-manufacturing , instructions for proof-reading , specimens of typography , the text of the

		This handsomely printed volume is published by Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sous .

		Among the many attractive editions of standard English literature published this season by
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, we note with particular approval the reprints of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	s poems and
Brown	PERSON	- ing 's '' The Ring and the Book . ''

		The Arnold volume includes a number of early poems hitherto uncollected , and has an introduction by Mr.
Nathan Haskell Dole	PERSON	.

		But why , oh why , does Mr.
Dole	PERSON	say that Arnold con - demned the American people as a race that knew not
Obermann	PERSON	, '' as a knowledge of
Obermann	PERSON	was in his eyes a test of civilization '' ?

		The special features of the
Browning	PERSON	volume are the biography , introduction , and explanatory notes contributed by the editors , Miss Char - lotte
Porter	PERSON	and Miss Hi-len
A. Clarke	PERSON	, whose zeal for their chosen poet is well known to readers of '' Poet - Lore , '' and whose fitness for the present task no one may question .

		`` The Works of Francois Rabelais , '' in the famous old translation of Urqtihart and
Motteux	PERSON	, are republished in a tasteful five-volume edition by
Messrs. Gibbings & Co.	ORGANIZATION	of

		The
Doubleday & McClure Co.	ORGANIZATION	, a new publishing firm , have sent us some interesting announcements which reached us too late for inclusion in the '' List of Fall Announcements '' in our last issue .

		Among the title * on their list may be mentioned
Mark Twain	PERSON	's new book , '' Following the Equator '' ; `` The Open Boat , and Other Tales of Adventure , '' by Mr.
Stephen Crane	PERSON	; an eighteen - volume edition of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, edited by Prof.
Henry Morley	PERSON	; `` Tales from
McClure	PERSON	's , '' in three volumes ; `` Bird Neighbors , '' with fifty colored illustrations ; a volume by
Colonel Waring	PERSON	, of the
New York	LOCATION	street - cleaning department ; and a half-dozen other equally interesting books .

		Mr.
Richard Holt Button	PERSON	, who died on the
10th of September	DATE	, was best known to the world as the editor of the `` Spectator . ''

		His personality was so merged in that review that he found little opportunity for out - side literary work , and the list of his books is a brief one , including only the '' Scott '' in the '' English Men of Letters '' and a few volumes of miscellaneous essays in criticism .

		He was a strong and serious writer -LRB- if anything over-serious -RRB- , and the chief bent of his mind was in the direction of religious and philosophical prob - lems .

		His temper was conservative , the concession * to liberalism that he could not help making in this age of the world were made grudgingly , and he did not always display the candor that we had the right to ex - pect of a writer occupying his position .

		His best crit - ical writing is probably to be found in his essays on .

		Arnold and
Newman	PERSON	.

THE CHICAGO PUBLIC LIBRARY	ORGANIZATION	.

		The four great libraries of
Chicago	LOCATION	have gained for this city of late years the reputa - tion of being the chief treasure-house of books for public use in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The statistics of the large collections in the
Public Library	ORGANIZATION	and
the University Library	ORGANIZATION	, and of the magnificent endowments of the
Newberry	PERSON	and
Crerar Libraries	ORGANIZATION	, have been published abroad , and made many students wish that they had access to such vast stores of printed material .

		This has , however , been distinctly a case of distance lending enchantment to the view ; for those who have actually sought to pursue their studies in the
Chicago	LOCATION	collections have had a tale of their own to tell widely at variance with the preconceptions of the out - sider .

		They have learned from sad experience that the library advantages of
Chicago	LOCATION	were mostly advantages in posse , and that many a less famous library centre offered opportuni - ties of greater practical value .

		The Univer - sity Library , even by those who could get access to it , was found to be a great mass of undigested material , the contents of which no one seemed to know with any degree of exact - ness .

		The
Newberry Library	ORGANIZATION	was found to be housed in a magnificent building , but in itself a meagre and unsymmetrical collection , strong in books for show , and in two or three of the many departments of knowledge , but so crippled by its extravagant expenditure for building purposes as to be debarred forever from the power to increase its stores at any - thing like the rate which its original endow - ment would have seemed to warrant .

		The
Crerar Library	ORGANIZATION	was found to be but a begin - ning , of interest only to students of science , and inaugurated upon a plan which , although wise and full of promise for the future , could offer little for the needs of the present investi - gator .

		The Public Library , finally , although in possession of the most generally useful col - lection of books , was so cramped for space , and so ill equipped for the purposes of the student , that it was simply impossible to make any seri - ous use of its resources .

		A way of escape from this rather cheerless condition of affairs has at last been provided 208 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, by the completion of the Public Library build - ing , which is now ready for use , and which was formally dedicated to the public a few days ago , on the twenty-sixth anniversary of the Great Fire .

		As far as one , at least , of the four libra - ries of
Chicago	LOCATION	is concerned , promise has become fulfilment , and the student may enter into his long-awaited heritage of opportunity .

		Within the walls of this building there are now gathered a quarter of a million volumes , repre - senting all the departments of literature ; and every conceivable means for the facilitation of their use , whether by the casual reader or the serious student , has been provided by the lib - erality of a
City Council	ORGANIZATION	which , whatever its shortcomings , has nearly always been willing to make appropriations commensurate with the needs of the institution , and may be trusted to provide as adequate support in the future as it has provided in the past .


Chicago	LOCATION	has nothing more entirely creditable to show the stranger than this Library , and may point to it with just pride as an evidence that the higher needs of civilization have not been lost sight of amid all the jostling material interests of the community .

		The
Chicago	LOCATION	building is one of the three costliest structures devoted to library purposes in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The two millions of dollars expended upon it have brought their full architectural and decorative equivalent , and if the buildings at
Washington	LOCATION	and
Boston	LOCATION	have cost more money it may safely be said that neither of them represents an expenditure as judicious , or applied as closely to the special purposes for which a library building should be designed .

		When such a building is to be erected , there is always a conflict between two theories .

		One of these theories is held by architects ; the other by professional librarians .

		It is unnecessary to say which of these theories is right , and which wrong , and it is pleasant to state that the right theory has prevailed in the plans of the
Chicago	LOCATION	edifice .

		In consequence of the above fact , this latest of great library buildings is not a pile of masonry built for external show , nor is it a gallery for the exhi - bition of pictured and sculptured masterpieces .

		It is simply a dignified structure , somewhat severe in design , provided with decorative adornments that please the eye but do not tend to attract gaping throngs of visitors who care nothing for books and only get in the way of the quiet student .

		The theory that library buildings should be planned for library pur - poses never had a stouter champion than the late Dr.
Poole	PERSON	, and it is a happy eventuation that has made the Library which he organized the best existing exemplification of the ideas for which he so insistently contended .

		The history of this Library is familiar to all who are Chicagoans , and to many who are not .

		We need not retell at any length how it sprang from the ruins of the burned city , how the grace - ful act of
Thomas Hughes	PERSON	provided a nucleus for the collection , how the books were for a time stored in a disused water-tank , how an emergency law for the establishment of public libraries was passed by the
Illinois Legisla	ORGANIZATION	- ture , how the services of the greatest of Amer - ican librarians were secured , how the books grew in number and have sojourned in three sets of temporary quarters before finding their permanent home , or how the support of the public , at first somewhat grudgingly given to the enterprise , has grown steadily more and more cordial and generous , until there is at last upon all hands abundant evidence that the city not of the few , but of the masses is thor - oughly in sympathy with the aims of the insti - tution , and determined to keep it in the front rank of public collections of books .

		All of these things are an old story ; but what is per - haps not generally understood outside of Chi - cago is the wise policy by which the directors of the institution have kept it all the time in close touch with all ages and conditions of readers .

		While it has never catered to the tastes of de - praved or vicious persons , it has to a consid - erable extent supplied the public with what it wants rather than what in the minds of superior persons it ought to want .

		This delicate ques - tion is necessarily one of degree .

		The aim of a library should be , first , to attract readers , because the reading habit is a good thing in itself , and , second , to improve the tastes of readers , not by forcing culture upon them , but by leading them in the direction of culture without their being conscious of the guidance .

		The extent to which this aim has been realized is best shown by the simple statement that the percentage of fiction among the books read is only about one-half what it was in the early days of the Library .

		And it must be remem - bered that this statement concerns the institu - tion which has a larger home circulation than any other public library in the world .

		So remarkable a degree of practical usefulness is accounted for by the system of delivery stations scattered all over the city , which bring the books within easy reach of every household .

		It is by such methods and policies that the
Chicago	LOCATION	1897 . -RSB-

		THE
DIAL 209 Public Library	ORGANIZATION	has won its place in the affec - tions of a vast community , and has set an ex - ample that the rest of the country may profit - ably follow .

		We may almost say that it has followed the example , for the
Illinois	LOCATION	Library Act has furnished a model for similar legisla - tion in many other States , and the city which chiefly illustrates the direct operation of that act has long been one of the principal foci of ideas about library management made so in large degree by the fact that it was for twenty years the home of
William Frederick Poole	PERSON	.

		WEEN DOCTORS DISAGREE . ''

		Now who shall arbitrate ?

		Ten men love what I hate , Shun what I follow , slight what I receive ; Ten , who in ears and eyes Match me : we all surmise , They this thing , and I that : whom shall my soul believe ? ''

		Well may the general student ask this same pertinent question when he finds himself , as he cer - tainly will if he reads the critics , fairly in confusion amid the various opposing dicta on current expres - sion in thought and literature .

		The poet finds an answer to his searching inquiry in the suggestion , `` Let age speak the truth and give us peace at last ! ''

		To be sure , it is within the realm of ethics and psychology that Rabbi
Ben Ezra	PERSON	leads the young disciple thus afield ; but is it any the less true that in the domain of logic and aesthetics the same theory should be applied , the same principle be dominant ?

		A series of articles appearing in a prominent magazine , which , under the general title '' Revaluations of Literature , '' open afresh the discussion of reputations and estimates commonly looked upon as established and unimpeachable , sug - gests the necessity of a general verification of our positions concerning the classics of a generation ago , with the entire propriety of an occasional `` re - valuation '' of the sages and prophets of the imme - diate past .

		Concerning the fallibility of contem - porary judgment , all remark is trite ; we long ago admitted that age is the only certain test although there is a natural impatience of the event .

		Very good , meanwhile let those who assume authority speak : amid the various voices the tones of truth will eventually be recognized ; criticism is progres - sive , and literary discussions supply the process by which the world 's judgment will finally be evolved .

		Contemporary criticism may be correct , it may be wrong ; but age will speak the truth , posterity will know .

		Debate , discussion , controversy , such has been the habit of human thought , and thus have the great institutions of humanity been developed .

		There is blasting in the quarry before the granite blocks can be piled up to build the capitol .

		In rolling-mills and foundries there is melting with fervent heat , and thunder of ponderous hammers , before steel plates can be riveted or iron girders be trussed into place .

		With heat and explosion has man wrought his way through the perplexities of speculation and science : is it not to be expected that in literary criticism his judgments will evolve as they have already evolved in philosophy and dogma ?

		Let literary partisans have their say , and let no one in the court be shocked that counsel grows emphatic .

		The jury is intelligent , albeit slow ; the judge is qualified to try the case ; in the end , verdict and judgment will be found in accordance with the law ; there will be no exceptions and no appeal .

		In plain words , why shun controversy ?

		is there any disposition so to do ?

		Oh , yes , Mr.
Mealy	PERSON	- mouth dreads discussion .

		He is so modest that he jumps if someone contradicts him , and straightway sees the object in his vision from his opponent 's view-point .

		Rarely does he hazard a downright affirmation : '' I think , '' or '' it seems to me , '' or '' me judice '' or '' now possibly this is so . ''

		There are some who repeat the same expressions , not because of diffidence , but because of affectation .

		Neither they nor Mr.
Mealymouth	PERSON	can be accounted helpers of mankind .

		The cry is for authority , which means knowledge , more of knowledge than the general ; not absolute , but approximating , ap - proaching the truth .

		What the world demands of the scholar is , not what he thinks he thinks , but what he thinks he knows .

		Gradually , honestly , inevitably , the world ponders , weighs his dictum .

		The thinking world will fix its value in time .

		There is , however , an old distinction not yet to be ignored : the distinction between opinion and conviction .

		The scientists discriminate better than the critics ; perhaps in the nature of materials it is easier for the former so to do . ''

		What is your opinion with reference to thought transference ? ''

		asked an inquirer of Doctor Bose , the Hindoo scien - tist . ''

		I must decline to express it .

		There is no experimental basis upon which to make a satisfac - tory statement , '' was the reply .

		Signer Marconi , the electrician , was asked if he believed that in a certain experiment waves of energy were actually sent through a hill . ''

		That is my present belief , but I do not wish to state it as a fact .

		I am not certain , '' was his answer .

		Which might lead one to assert that the scholar 's attitude is that of learner as well as teacher , always ; and , furthermore , that because the scholar thinks a thing is so , his thought does not make it so ; nor will his wish that a certain thing be true , of itself make his theory a fact .

		The literary world has made some progress in its ability to deal with candor and to reason temper - ately on differences of moment . ''

		What an over - worn and bed-ridden argument is this !

		the last refuge ever of old falsehood ... this was the plea of Judaism and idolatry against Christ and his Apostles ... these rotten principles , '' etc. .

		Thus
John Milton	PERSON	, in one of those mild confutations and animadversions wherein seventeenth-century schol - 210 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, arship delighted .

		And yet , in that age of intoler - ance , as in other ages when the fires have burned more fiercely , it is not difficult now to see that the fiery tongues that shot out and over and around were but the writhings of a single blaze , tongues of one great surging flame , of that purifying fire that tries the truth .

		They leaped a myriad ways , they divided , they flashed , they stung ; yet out of the flame walked Truth , unharmed , triumphant .

		Of course , to-day such burnings are incongruous and ought to be impossible ; yet there are occasions when the literary controversialist needs to be re - minded sharply that tolerance and calmness are not so much virtues as evidences of common sense ; and that gentlemen in debate allow intelligence and some freedom in deduction , even , to honorable opponents who have had the floor .

		Because he knows , or thinks he knows , the scholar need not expect everyone else to know in the self-same way ; still less need he expect praise from all quarters because he has published his knowledge to the world .

		The scholar , then , must keep his heart sweet and happy ; this is the great lesson , the hardest lesson of all .

		To be right , and not to lose one 's temper ; to teach truth , and not turn cynic when the world does n't see it that way .


Ruskin	PERSON	said of
Albert Diirer	PERSON	, that someone found fault with his engraving .

		The artist replied , '' It can ' t be better done '' '' but , '' adds
Ruskin	PERSON	, '' he did n't get huffy ! ''

		We wish the same statement might be true , by the way , concerning our vigorous and autocratic essayist himself .

		Who can read without amusement the trenchant footnotes with which
Ruskin	PERSON	has peppered the pages of his earlier writings in the Brantwood edition of his works !

		Here is a good example of modern testiness , somewhat in the old Miltonic style , which we find attached to a paragraph in '' Stones of
Venice	LOCATION	, '' with reference to the architecture of
Verona	LOCATION	: '' Alas , the noblest example of it ,
Fra Giocondo	LOCATION	's exquisite loggia , has been daubed and damned , by the modern restorer , into a caricature worse than a Christmas clown 's .

		The exquisite colors of the Renaissance fresco , pure as rose-leaves and dark laurel the modern Italian decorator thinks ` sporco , ' and replaces by buff-color of oil - cloth , and Prussian green spluttering his gold about wherever the devil prompts him , to enrich the whole . ''

		Yet this is not so much humor as irasci - bility , and would hardly do , even for
John Ruskin	PERSON	, did we not consider the sensitiveness and impatience of old age .

		Since the days of the great essayists and reviewers who , by the way , won their title because of something more than mere arrogance of style an '' intelligent public '' has not cared much for that sort of thing .

		The critic is clearly right in giving forcible expression to his mind ; but it is quite essential that he have a mind of some weight to ex - press , and that he utter his convictions with becom - ing respect for the convictions of those who differ .

		In the pages of '' The Ettrick Shepherd '' one may find this happy picture of the scholar asserting his own authority all the more admirable as coming from one who had submitted to extreme tests in the school of experience and adversity . ''

		Gin I thocht Papistry a fause thing , which I do , I wadna scruple to say sae in sic terms as were consistent wi ' gude manners , and wi ' charity and humility of heart .

		But I wad ca ' nae man a leear ! ''

		If such amenity can be conceived as tempering theological debate , is it too much to hope for human nature that this genial spirit may pervade the field of criticism ?

		MR.
GRANT ALLEN	PERSON	AND COLLEGE EDUCATION .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The '' Cosmopolitan '' for
October	DATE	prosecutes Mr.
Walker	PERSON	's holy war against existing educational methods and ideals , in somewhat bewildering fashion .

		It is not very hazardous to predict that many thoughtful readers of Mr.
Grant Allen	PERSON	's article will draw from Mr.
Allen	PERSON	's facts conclusions by no means identical with his .

		Mr.
Allen	PERSON	is eager to see boys dispatched to foreign lands , to seek their education in travel , and gives a glowing account of the stimulus he himself received from such an experience .

		Just such an educational experiment as Mr.
Allen	PERSON	suggests occurs to me ; and it will illustrate Mr.
Allen	PERSON	's theory perhaps quite as well as his own experience does .

		The subject of it , a young man of eighteen , informed me in our second talk that he had spent much of the previous year at a small place in
Italy	LOCATION	, adding , with evident reluctance at its obscurity , that it was called
Verona	LOCATION	: he supposed I had never heard of it .

		Perhaps this will be thought an extreme case to cite against Mr.
Allen	PERSON	's theory of the educational sufficiency of travel ; but it seems much more in point for the article in question than Mr.
Allen	PERSON	's own experience , which is there cited .

		Mr.
Allen	PERSON	came to his travels , as he him - self says , after years of bondage to the existing educa - tional system , and found historic scenes inexpressibly rich in significance and interest , and full of delightful stimulus .

		Are we therefore to conclude with Mr.
Allen	PERSON	that his early servitude to Latin and Greek was a lament - able blunder ?

		Does not Mr.
Allen	PERSON	's story rather seem a telling vindication of the value of just such studies , while his testimony is not less noteworthy for being unintentional ?

		We should doubtless strive to view the attitude or may we say the pose ?

		of the '' Cosmopolitan '' as the iconoclast in education , unprejudiced by other phases of its work .

		Yet it seems hardly accidental that the mag - azine which sometimes is on the verge of advocating educational nihilism is the one which lately outraged its readers by thrusting before them photographic repre - sentations of the distorted corpses of a battlefield , and which just now illustrates its superiority to traditional methods by spelling the divine immanence without an a.

		SCIENTIFIC WORK IN RHETORIC .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The communication entitled '' The Lack of Scientific Work in Rhetoric , '' which appeared in THE DIAL for
September 16	DATE	, left unsaid , it seems to me , some things
1897	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 211 that are pertinent to the subject under discussion .

		There are , doubtless , few who would take exception to your contributor 's arraignment of much that passes cur - rent in our schools and colleges as the science of rhetoric , the lifeless and deadening applications of an outworn philosophy , formulas whose chief virtue is , perhaps , that they are furthest removed from anything that could be called '' rhetorical '' in an objectionable sense ; or , on the other hand , the more or less unpremeditated effusions that rest on no conscious philosophy at all .

		There can be no question as to the present vital need of a rhetoric whose methods shall be the methods of modern scientific investigation , and whose relations to the kindred social and psychological sciences shall be made explicit .

		But it does behoove us , when we have arrived at this view of the situation , to look about us with some concern to see whether there are any tendencies at work pressing forward in the right direction and only waiting for due encouragement .

		If the colleges are largely responsible for the unfruit - ful condition of rhetoric to-day and this seems to be the charge of the writer of the communication it is surely to them that we must look for aid , provided it is not unwarrantable to assume that they are endowed with a sense of moral responsibility .

		Upon them rests the obligation of answering for the kind of rhetoric they have been teaching and are teaching , when called to account .

		And the obligation is already being faced in the graduate departments of some of the larger univer - sities in a scientific way , as in the case of the
University of Michigan	ORGANIZATION	, the first to offer graduate courses in rhe - toric , where for some years past graduate research work has been carried on with reference to various problems in rhetoric , involving the social sciences on the one side , and the laboratory methods of experimental psychology on the other .

		Just how far such researches as these have gone toward making for a truly scientific theory of rhetoric , it is difficult to say , because of the absence of any organ of communication between groups of investigators .

		It is one of the paradoxes of history that the science which is concerned primarily with com - munication , with the economics of the exchange and transportation of spiritual commodities , should have no organ of communication itself , no common carrier .

		This lack of a suitable medium of publication is enough to make one think that '' the science of rhetoric is fifty to a hundred years behind economics and psychology . ''

		It explains , in a measure , why '' the work of each writer is generally unadvantageously individual in some re - spects each author usually attempting to cover the whole field of the subject '' ; for such a state of affairs as this is due not merely to '' the comparative absence of scientific methods , '' but also , and perhaps first of all , to the absence of an opportunity for comparing results attained , and so furthering '' division of labor and intel - ligent cooperation . ''

		Some attempts have been made , I believe , toward satisfying this need of an organ of communication , as , for example , the publication , in con - nection with the courses already referred to , of the series entitled '' Contributions to Rhetorical Theory . ''

		It will be through the encouragement of such attempts as these that a very immediate and practical rhetorical problem will be solved .

		If in working to bring about any reform , it is wisest to league with those elements that have begun , spon - taneously it may seem , to right the wrong and bring order out of lawlessness , so in the case of the present chaotic , and at the same time scholastic , condition of rhetorical theory , it may be well to seek out and try to further those tendencies which have begun to shape things anew for the better .

		A TEXT FROM TEXT-BOOKS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THB DIAL . -RRB-

		It has been my fortune , as a teacher in a secondary school of some prominence , to receive from a dozen or more competing publishers a variety of editions of the English classics that are now required for admission to most American colleges .

		As fast as I have received these books I have placed them side by side in my library , until they now fill two or three shelves .

		In their motley array they present anything but a uniform appearance .

		They are bound in all sorts of colors , printed on all sorts of paper , and their original portions written in all sorts of styles , that is , when they are written at all , for some of them do not seem even to have been written , but simply put together .

		And while the ways of their editors are as varied as the colors in which the books themselves are bound , in one respect they are very much alike .

		Nearly all of them have a remarkable tendency -LRB- which they in nowise overcome -RRB- to fill their books with masses of unassimilated material with introductions which do not introduce , with notes which do not explain , and with suggestions which do not suggest .

		On the whole , these books , while they evidence the general awakening of interest in the study of English , appear also to emphasise the maze of meth - ods in which we are just now floundering .

		It has seemed to me that many of the sins commit - ted in these books may be laid to the fact that most of them are edited by men who have had no actual con - tact with secondary school work .

		Having taught in both college and high school , I maintain that it is not a suffi - cient qualification for a text - book editor merely to have observed '' carefully the needs of students who present themselves for admission to college , '' as one prospectus puts it , but that some teaching experience in either the high school or the academy is essential to an apprecia - tion of the real needs of the secondary school student .

		I am further convinced of this when I observe one col - lege editor quoting in the introduction to his book some - thing like fifty pages of critical comment on his author and work , the most of which is bound to prove dry and hard reading for the average high-school student , and another printing more than one hundred pages of notes to less than half that number of text .

		A third , who crowds his pages with a multitude of questions that would occur at once to any live teacher , is no better .

		Is not the cause worthy of something better ?

		May we not have an edition of the English classics which will be the result of the united efforts of such of the secondary school teachers of the country as combine the necessary scholarship with some degree of literary abil - ity , sufficient , at any rate , to eliminate the unessen - tials which overload the books we now have , and to arrange the material used with a view to artistic effect ?

		THE TEXNYSOX MEMOIRS .

		* '' Old ghosts whose day was done ere mine began , If earth be seen from your conjectured heaven , Ye know that History is half-dream ay even The man 's life in the letters of the man .

		There lies the letter , but it is not he As he retires into himself and is : Sender and sent-to go to make up this , Their offspring of this union .

		And on me Frown not old ghosts , if I be one of those Who make you utter things you did not say , And mould you all awry and mar your worth ; For whatsoever knows us truly , knows That none can truly write his single day , And none can write it for him upon earth . ''

		f In the foregoing Sonnet -LRB- written originally as a preface to ''
Becket	PERSON	, '' and first published in the work now before us -RRB- the late Lord
Tennyson	PERSON	expressed incidentally his conviction of the essential insufficiency of all biography .

		Letters the most intimate , being unavoidably tinged by the personality of '' sent-to '' as well as `` sender , '' but partially or fitfully reveal the writer `` as he retires into himself and is '' ; while if it is given to no man to '' truly write his single day , '' then surely '' none can write it for him upon earth . ''

		Lord
Tennyson	PERSON	, as we learn , disliked the notion of a long , formal biography .

		For those who cared to know the spiritual side of his literary history , he wrote `` Merlin and the Gleam . ''

		That figurative account of his poetic progress he seems to have thought `` would probably be enough of bio - graphy for those friends who urged him to write about himself . ''

		But however modest his estimate of the biographical demands of these friends , he can scarcely have thought for a mo - ment that the veiled , mystical intimations of ''
Merlin	PERSON	, '' dim adumbrations of spiritual pro- cesses which the poet himself but imperfectly divined , would satisfy the curiosity of the gen - eral public , or indeed meet the questions which that public would be most likly to ask .

		Most men look to biography solely for the sort of personal information in which the prince of biographers ,
James Boswell	PERSON	, chiefly dealt ; and a biography of the Boswellian type , Lord Ten - nyson must have known was inevitable .

		From the disclosures of such a biography , were it ever so candid , he had little reason to shrink .

		Here , the unflinching pen of a Froude could point out no jarring discrepancies between the man and bis work .

		multitude , who viewed him solely through the transfiguring medium of his verse , he really was , to a quite exceptional degree .

		His life and his message were nobly of a piece .

		As we have already said ,
Tennyson	PERSON	disliked the idea of a long , formal biography .

		But as his life must inevitably be written , he was anxious that it be written once and for all that it be so written as to preclude the chance of further and unauthentic biographies .

		His wish in this regard seems to us to be met , as fully as it was possible to meet it , in the noble volumes now before us , the pious work of his son , the present Lord
Tennyson	PERSON	.

		Some future aftermath of Tennysonian memories there will probably be ; but
Lord Tennyson	LOCATION	has given us what must remain for all time the one full and authoritative Life of his father .

		Touching his method ,
Lord Tennyson	PERSON	says : `` According to my father 's wish , throughout the memoir my hand will be as seldom seen as may be , and this accounts for the occasionally fragmentary charac - ter of my work .

		The anecdotes and sayings here related have been mostly taken down as soon as spoken , and are hence , I trust , not marred or mended by mem - ory , which , judging from some anecdotes of him recently published , is wont to be a register not wholly accurate . ''

		The foregoing paragraph fairly indicates the general form and character of the work , which is essentially a rich storehouse of
Tenny	PERSON	- soniana , to which the best minds in
England	LOCATION	have lavishly contributed , rather than an attempt at a set recital and formal biography of the sort the poet himself would have disap - proved of .

		Regular narrative is not , of course , wholly wanting .

		Such facts as people natur - ally wish to know concerning the poet 's ances - try , birth , homes , schools , college life , friend - ships , travels , etc. , are given in order .

		As to manuscripts left by his father ,
Lord Tenny	PERSON	- son says : '' The most interesting to me are my father 's unpub - lished poems and letters , and notes on his own life and work left me for publication after his death ,
Arthur Hallam	PERSON	's letters ,
Edward Fitzgerald	PERSON	's private MS. notes , and the journal of our home life . ''

		As to the '' unpublished poems , '' it is pleasant to say that the volumes are enriched with them to a degree more likely to surpass than to fall short of the hopes of the most san - guine Tennysonian .

		Lavish quotation of these belated treasures of song would be obviously unfair ; but we may venture on an extract or two , with the certainty of whetting , rather than appeasing , the reader 's appetite .

		The follow - ing stanzas , entitled - '' The Mother 's Ghost , '' belong to the period 1832-35 .

		THE DIAL 213 '' Not a whisper stirs the gloom , It will be the dawning soon , We may glide from room to room , In the glimmer of the moon : Every heart is lain to rest , All the house is fast in sleep , Were I not a spirit blest , Sisters , I could almost weep ! ''

		In that cradle sleeps my child , She whose birth brought on my bliss ; On her forehead undefiled I will print an airy kiss : See , she dreameth happy dreams , Her hands are folded quietly , Like to one of us she seems , One of us my child will be . ''

		* Of a later date than the foregoing verses are the indignant lines , written in the poet 's under - graduate days , on '' Cambridge of
1830	DATE	'' the narrow and lethargic
Cambridge	LOCATION	of which
Macaulay	PERSON	said : '' We see men of four and five and twenty , loaded with academical honors and rewards scholarships , fellowships , whole cab - inets of medals , whole shelves of prize-books , enter into life with their education still to begin ; unacquainted with the first principles of the laws under which they live , unacquainted with the very rudiments of moral and political science . ''

		Cambridge was , in the eyes of the more practical and progressive , then an insti - tution consecrated by prejudice and immemorial usage to the business of launching upon the world a yearly batch of mediaeval-minded young gentlemen , who , so far as the training of their Venerable Mother went , were about as well fitted as so many
Kaspar Hausers	PERSON	to grapple with the realities of practical life .

		The young
Tennyson	PERSON	expressed his opinion of the prevail - ing regime in a sonnet which is perhaps more vigorous and biographically suggestive than poetic . ''

		Therefore your Halls , your ancient Colleges , Your portals statued with old kings and queens , Your gardens , myriad-volumed libraries , Wax-lighted chapels , and rich-carven screens , Your doctors , and your proctors , and your deans , Shall not avail you when the Day-beam sports New-risen o'er awakened

''

		* The voices of the new age , indeed , early awakened a responsive echo in the spirit of
Tennyson	LOCATION	.

		To the political issues that stirred
England	LOCATION	in his youth he was keenly alive .

		It is pleasantly related that when the news of the passing of the Reform Bill for

		sons , headed by the poet , rushed out into the darkness to the neighboring church , and rang the bells as madly as the '' inspired tinker '' himself might have rung them in the days of his unregenerate youth .

		Whereat , says the author of the Memoir , '' The new parson , horrified at hearing his bells rung , and not merely rung but furiously clashed , without his leave , came rushing into his church , and in the pitch blackness laid hold of the first thing which he could clap hand to , and this happened to be my aunt
Cecilia	PERSON	's little dog which forthwith tried to bite .

		The
Tenny	PERSON	- sons then disclosed themselves amid much laughter ; and the parson , who I suppose was a Tory of the old school , was with difficulty pacified .

		More than once my father thought of turning this scene into verse as an interesting picture of the times . ''

		An extremely interesting and valuable fea - ture of the work are the letters to and from
Tennyson	LOCATION	, with which both volumes are thickly studded .

		One of the earlier ones , from
John Sterling	PERSON	, hits pleasantly at
Carlyle	LOCATION	.

		``
Carlyle	PERSON	was here yesterday evening , growled at having missed you , and said more in your praise than in anyone 's except
Cromwell	PERSON	and an American back - woodsman who has killed thirty or forty people with a bowie-knife and since run away to

		A letter to Dean
Bradley	PERSON	-LRB- 1855 -RRB- acknowl - edges the receipt of a volume of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	. ''

		Many thanks for the Arnold : nobody can deny that he is a poet . '

		The
Merman	PERSON	' was an old favorite of mine , and I like him as well as ever . '

		The
Scholar Gipsy	ORGANIZATION	' is quite new to me , and I have an affection for him , which I think will increase . ''

		Apropos of the foregoing letter , it may be noted that the author was entrusted years later by his father with the following message for Mr.
Arnold	PERSON	: '' Tell Mat not to write any more of those prose things like ' Literature and Dogma , ' but to give us something like his ` Thyrsis , ' ` Scholar
Gipsy	LOCATION	, ' or ` Forsaken Merman . ' ''

		Mr.
Arnold	PERSON	naturally took the monition in good part , and told the story glee - fully '' all over
London	LOCATION	. ''

		In a note from Mr.
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	, the reader may possibly discern a tinge of uncon - scious humor . ''

		I happened recently to be re-reading your Poem ' The Two Voices , ' and coming to the verse ' Or if thro ' lower lives I came Tho ' all experience past became Consolidate in mind and frame ' it occurred to me that you might like to glance through a book which applies to the elucidation of mental science the hypothesis to which you refer .

		I therefore beg your acceptance of ' Psychology , ' which I send by this post . ''

		Whether or no the laureate '' glanced through '' Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	's formidable chef-d'oeuvre is not 214 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, recorded .

		Touching the philosophical content of
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's work , Professor
Jowett	PERSON	-LRB- a , fre - quently recurring name in the '' Life '' -RRB- once observed : '' Your poetry has an element of philosophy more to be considered than any regular philosophy in
England	LOCATION	.

		It is almost too much impregnated with philosophy , yet this to some minds will be its greatest charm .

		I believe that your ' In Memoriam ' and ' Crossing the Bar ' will live forever in men 's hearts . ''

		One may venture to suggest here , in all defer - ence , that
Tennyson	PERSON	's poetry , especially the pieces cited by the
Master of Balliol	ORGANIZATION	, may be said to be impregnated with the '' breath and finer spirit '' of the current '' regular phil - osophy in
England	LOCATION	, '' rather than to be remark - able for any such element of their own distinct from that philosophy .

		Do not , for instance , the groups of stanzas in '' In Memoriam '' numbered LIV. , LV. , and LVL , really sum up and nobly transfigure what may be termed the '' Gospel of Modern Thought '' ?

		Having cited Professor
Jowett	PERSON	, we may fitly quote here from a letter by him to Lady
Tennyson	PERSON	-LRB- 1858 -RRB- , in which he incidentally appraises criticism as a form of literature .

		`` You asked me whether I could suggest any sub - jects for poetry .

		I have been so presumptuous as to think of some .

		I do n't believe that poetical feelings and imagery can ever be exhausted .

		That is only a fancy which comes over us when our minds are dry or in moments of depression .

		This generation is certainly more poetical and imaginative than the last , and per - haps , in spite of the critics , the next may be more poet - ical than our own .

		And as to the critics , their power is not really great .

		Wagon-loads of them are lighting fires every week or on their way to the grocers .

		I often fancy that the critical form of modern literature is like the rhetorical one which overlaid ancient literature , and will be regarded as that is , at its true worth in after times .

		One drop of natural feeling in poetry or the true statement of a single new fact is already felt to be of more value than all the critics put together . ''

		Tennyson 's allusions to
America	LOCATION	and Amer - icans are throughout generally in a kindly spirit enough though we find him , in a letter to Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	-LRB- 1872 -RRB- , threatening that `` If you let those Yankees get anything like their way of you in the
Alabama	LOCATION	claims , I wont pay my ' ship-money ' any more than old Hamp - den . ''

		A letter of later date , however -LRB- to Dr. Van Dyke -RRB- , contains the assurance that '' The report -LRB- which you quote -RRB- that I dislike Amer - icans is wholly without foundation , though it is true that I have protested against the manner in which some of the American publishers have pilfered my work . ''

		Lord
Tennyson	PERSON	, of course , had the penalties as well as the rewards of his popularity on this side the water .

		He was long one of the stock '' objects of interest '' for the transatlantic tourist .

		It is recorded that one misguided en - thusiast descended upon
Aldworth	PERSON	with the staggering announcement that he had worked his way across the
Atlantic	LOCATION	in a cattle ship , solely in order to recite '' Maud '' to its author which he forthwith proceeded to do . ''

		Hav - ing pity on the man , '' says the narrator , '' my father allowed him to do so , but suffered from the recitation .

		We paid the reciter 's passage back to
America	LOCATION	, but never heard of him again . ''

		Lord
Tennyson	PERSON	's Life of his father is un - unquestionably a book that permanently and appreciably enriches English literature .

		It is hardly possible to conceive of a generation to come that it will not deeply interest , contain - ing as it does the best and truest that could be said of
Alfred Lord Tennyson	PERSON	, as man and as poet , by those of his contemporaries who were best qualified to speak of him .

		It is a book eloquent of pious toil , of modest self-repres - sion , of filial solicitude lest the bounds of a somewhat difficult prescribed standard be over - stepped , of anxiety to leave no source untried whence a ray of real biographical light was to be looked for .

		Lord
Tennyson	PERSON	has been liberally and directly assisted in his work by his father 's more intimate and eminent friends .

		Tennyson 's letters to and from the Queen are piously enshrined by his son in a separate chapter .

		The opening volume is prefixed by a Chronology of the Books of Poems ; and the Index , we are glad to say , is a notably full and helpful one .

		In their material features the volumes are impeccable .

		The superb series of portraits fitly crowns a work which is a veritable literary feast from cover to cover .

		One more example of the generous aftermath of Tennysonian song we shall venture to give in closing an unpublished version of '' Sweet and Low . '' ''

		Bright is the moon on the deep , Bright are the cliffs in her beam , Sleep , my little one , sleep !

		Look , he smiles and opens his hands , He sees his father in distant lands , And kisses him there in a dream , Sleep , sleep . ''

		Father is over the deep , Father will come to thee soon , Sleep my pretty one , sleep !

		Father will come to his babe in the nest , Silver sails all out of the west , Under the silver moon , Sleep , sleep ! ''

		THE DIAL 215 THE FOUNDATIONS OF KNOWLEDGE .

		* Somewhat more than two hundred years ago , a company of gentlemen were engaged in the discussion of a problem of metaphysics .

		The longer they considered the question , the more completely they found themselves at sea .

		Finally it occurred to one of their number , a Mr.
John Locke	PERSON	, that their difficulties were caused by their failure to raise a fundamental question , namely , What are the powers of the human mind ; how much can we know , and how much from the very nature of our faculties must remain forever unknown ?

		Locke under - took to jot down a few thoughts on this subject for the benefit of his friends , and out of these detached notes grew the famous '' Essay Con - cerning Human Understanding . ''

		Thus was launched a new science , which to-day is known by the name of epistemology , or theory of knowledge .

		Not that
Locke	PERSON	is entitled to be considered its founder , in any other sense than that in which
Stevenson	PERSON	may be called the inventor of the locomotive .

		What he did was to so demonstrate the utility of this new discip - line by his own contributions as to assure it a permanent place in the world of philosophic thought .

		It can not be truthfully said that epistemology has always enjoyed a great share of popular favor .

		Its problems seem at first sight too remote from the interests of every-day life to be worth the effort and time necessary for their study .

		But the past generation has witnessed something of a revolution in this respect .

		The term agnosticism , introduced into the language by
Professor Huxley	LOCATION	, has called the attention of the public to a theory which if true is felt to be of the greatest importance to every human being .

		Following
Hume	PERSON	, whose interpreter he has made himself , Huxley declares that our only source of knowledge of the world without us is sensation .

		But all sensations , even those of sight and touch , are mere feelings which tell us nothing of the real nature of anything out - side of ourselves .

		Hence it is concluded that the world conceived to lie behind these sub - jective phenomena as their cause is absolutely inaccessible to human reason ; wherefore the theologian and the metaphysician , since they attempt to penetrate into this region , are on the same intellectual plane as the would-be inventor of the perpetual-motion machine .

		* THE THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE .

		A Contribution to some
Problems of Logic	ORGANIZATION	and Metaphysics .

		By
L. T. Hobhouse	PERSON	, Fellow and Assistant-Tutor at
Corpus Christi College	ORGANIZATION	,
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.


New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Within very recent years , Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	has given new life to the popular discussion of epis - temological questions .

		He has striven to show that there is evidence for the existence of God , the immortality of the soul , and the ultimate triumph of right over wrong , of equal validity with that for the accepted results of physical science .

		Scientific theories are never matters of experience in the strict sense of the term .

		They simply represent the way in which cer - tain observed facts must be put together if any explanation for them exists .

		Thus at the foundation of science lies the faith that all experience is ultimately explainable ; and the sole warrant for this faith , it is claimed , is the felt need of such explanation .

		But if this craving carries with it its own warrant of satis - faction , the same claim may be urged for all the other deeper cravings of our nature .

		If this be true , our belief in the existence of
Providence	LOCATION	may have exactly the same foun - dation as that in the uniformity of nature which is the basis of all generalization in science .

		Most readers will be familiar with the form which
Browning	PERSON	has given to this doctrine .

		Other thinkers as , notably ,
Coleridge	PERSON	, Car - lyle , and
Emerson	PERSON	have sought a different way out of agnosticism .

		They maintained the existence of certain intuitions which give us a direct knowledge of the invisible world , and acquaint us with those truths which are of most concern to our deeper life .

		Sometimes these intuitions are described as if they were revelations vouchsafed by a higher power to those whose lives render them worthy recip - ients of the message .

		Others have assimilated them to mathematical axioms , the truth of which the mind perceives as soon as they are presented .

		In one form or another , the doc - trine that what is non-existent for sense may thus be clear to the eye of reason , has been a favorite tenet from the time of Plato to the present day .

		It is the office of epistemology to examine these various conflicting contentions .

		It en - quires what we may know , how we gain our knowledge , and by what touchstone we may distinguish false beliefs from true .

		Its prov - ince is not confined to the question of the pos - sibility of knowing the supersensible world , but extends to all branches of human inquiry .

		It investigates , among other things , the condi - tions of that great body of knowledge upon which our so-called practical activity depends , and the grounds and justification of our gen - eralizations from what has happened in the 216 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, past to what will happen in the future ; it asks what is to be understood by the terms sub - stance , cause , and many others which we use confidently enough in daily life with but vague notions of their exact significance .

		No de - partment of the subject lies remote from the stir and hum of modern intellectual life .

		The nature of the relation of mind and body , for instance , can be discussed intelligently only when we understand the meaning of the word cause ; while the controversy which Professor
Ostwald	PERSON	has recently started * proves that the final interpretation of the facts brought to light by chemistry and physics requires an answer to the previous question , What is matter , and where do we get the evidence of its existence ?

		Of the treatises dealing with the theory of knowledge , that which Mr.
Hobhouse	PERSON	has re - cently given us is the most complete , as it is one of the ablest and most satisfactory , in the English language .

		No other English work covers the field so thoroughly .

		This fact , taken in connection with the keenness of analysis , sanity of judgment , and clearness of exposition exhibited throughout , make the work indispen - sable to the specialist , and at the same time admirably suited to the needs of the beginner .

		In his doctrine of matter , the author shows himself quite out of sympathy with the views held by the great majority of students of the subject , and the arguments advanced in sup - port of his position will probably strike most readers as more ingenious than convincing ; but even here the hall-mark of a great work is not wanting we learn as much from a chapter whose final conclusions we reject as from one whose reasoning carries with it complete con - viction .

		In general we seem to be reading a book which
Locke	PERSON	might have written after the work of
Hume	PERSON	and
Kant	PERSON	, Mill and
Green	ORGANIZATION	.

		The ultimate source of all the knowledge we as yet , at any rate , possess , is , we are told , the direct experience of a given content of con - sciousness .

		This represents the same thought which
Locke	PERSON	intended to express when he laid down his famous proposition that the source of all knowledge is experience , as given in sensa - tion on the one hand , and the consciousness of the operations of our own minds on the other .

		These contents may be remembered and ana - lyzed ; they may be subjected to the process of construction -LRB- or synthesis -RRB- by which wholes arise which have never before been given in their entirety -LRB- one example of this is the work of the imagination -RRB- ; and , finally , under certain * See '' Popular Science Monthly , ''
March , 1896	DATE	.

		conditions which it is the office of inductive logic to point out , the relations which obtain between the different elements of a content of consciousness may be generalized , so that we may affirm that what is perceived to be con - joined here and now will be found together everywhere and always .

		The axioms of mathe - matics are shown to be special cases under this principle , and so by implication the existence of a separate faculty to account for them is denied .

		Such , according to Mr.
Hobhouse	PERSON	, are the processes by which knowledge is gained .

		But now , what grounds have we for supposing that they terminate in truth ?

		Of course , we all know how one judgment may be corrected by comparison with another , and one observation by others more carefully conducted ; but the question is , what right have we to believe that our faculties , even when working in their per - fection , lead us to truth at all ?

		The reply is that when the deliverances of our various `` fac - ulties '' form a completely consistent system one from which all contradictions have been eliminated no motive and no rational justifi - cation remain for distrusting them .

		We begin , and we must end , with assuming that the work - ings of the mind are such that where har - monious they reveal to us reality .

		Any other assurance it would be senseless to demand .

		We thus find our questions answered as follows : We may know whatever is given in immediate experience , or is remembered , or may be in - ferred from the data supplied by experience ; the conditions of knowledge are the working of the processes already enumerated ; the justifica - tion for any confidence we may feel in them is the fact that their reports are consistent and mutually support each other .

		With reference to Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	's contention , Mr.
Hobhouse	PERSON	admits that the wants and crav - ings of our ethical and religious nature are capable of creating their own beliefs , or at least of influencing us in the selection of our creeds .

		Moreover , he thinks this procedure may ultimately be able to justify itself before the bar of reason .

		But , as against Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	, he urges that as yet there is no agreement as to just what these needs are , and what is neces - sary for their satisfaction .

		Until the partisans of this view are at one on these points , he re - gards their claims as not worth the considera - tion of a serious thinker .

		In this attenuated form , the doctrine that you may believe what you very much want to believe -LRB- for , notwith - standing all disclaimers , this is what it comes
1897	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 217 to -RRB- will probably do no harm .

		Of course , the possession of truth ordinarily yields a satis - faction of its own , and is often pursued for the sake of this satisfaction .

		But the '' logical Pharisee '' can point out that there must be , and is , other justification for the trust in our intellectual processes beyond the satisfaction they yield ; and if so , the entire argument of Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	falls to the ground .

		This by no means cuts us off from all access to the world of ultimate reality .

		The complete explanation of experience compels us to transcend expe - rience , as even agnosticism will be found to admit .

		Here , then , is a legitimate sphere for a scientific metaphysics , permanent contribu - tions to which may be found in the works of all the great masters of philosophy .

		THE STUDY OF ENGLISH WORDS .

		* The growing interest in the study of En - glish in our universities and secondary schools is especially encouraging to those who realize how absolutely human progress is dependent on the ability to record and to communicate facts and ideas .

		The impatience of '' practical peo - ple '' with the study of language would be an insoluble puzzle to the thoughtful observer , if the ungrateful tendency of human nature to take for granted the most important elements in well-being were not too familiar to need more than a passing mention . ''

		Practical people '' above all others ought to recognize the value of words .

		The idealist may imagine , in some vague way , that thought can communicate itself without expression ; but to those who deal with the visible and tangible , the embodiment of the thought should be scarcely less important than the thought itself .

		That its importance is not more generally realized is due to the fact that a fit medium of expression is , like air and sun - shine , usually taken for granted .

		When the public can be made to understand that discrim - ination is as necessary in the choice of words as in the selection of materials for a bicycle or a bridge or for a durable garment , a great step will have been taken in popular education .

		In these democratic days the educational ten - dency is , as has been often pointed out , to level down rather than to level up .

		The humanities are sacrificed to the sciences ; studies that ele - vate and refine are subordinated to the so-called * A STUDY OF ENGLISH WORDS .

		utilities of life .

		Under these circumstances , those who believe that '' man does not live by bread alone '' find ample ground for encourage - ment in the rapidly growing interest in that great English literature which , in addition to its native vigor , has shown a remarkable power of absorbing what is best in other literatures .

		The study of English as language has not hitherto kept pace with the study of English as literature ; yet the appreciation of English as literature is inevitably dependent on the understanding of English as language , an axiomatic truth that is obscured by the habit of taking the understanding of English for granted .

		Every other art must be taught ; but one of the most difficult and most vitally im - portant of all the arts , the art of expression , is supposed to be acquired instinctively .

		It is acquired , to a certain extent , not instinctively , but unconsciously , by a few highly-favored in - dividuals those who are born into families where words are carefully chosen , where nice distinctions are made , where books of the high - est type are intimate companions ; yet in order that the choice of words may be intelligent , these unconscious influences must be , and in such families generally are , supplemented by systematic training .

		The old custom of teach - ing children Latin at an early age , and the con - sequent discovery , in childhood , that ideas do not necessarily arise with the words to fit them , and that the selection of the right word is a matter requiring care and thought , gave the needed stimulus to the sense of discrimination .

		Now that the study of Latin is postponed to a later period in school life , or more frequently omitted altogether , while teachers in the grade schools are often familiar with no language but their own , and in many cases not intelligently familiar with that , indications that the scientific study of English is working down from the uni - versities to the secondary schools , with a conse - quent improvement in the methods of the pri - mary schools , can not be too heartily welcomed .

		In connection with these indications , the appearance of a text-book of English words , that is written on scientific principles , is of peculiar interest to all who believe that an in - telligent use and understanding of the English language is the fundamental requisite of a good education ; and that , in the last analysis , that use and understanding must be conditioned on a keen sense of the value of words . ''

		A Study of English Words , '' by Miss
Jessie Mac	PERSON	- millan
Anderson	PERSON	, is evidently the work of one who combines with an unusual appreciation of 218 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, the English language , and a scientific training in its principles , a rare power of imparting her own interest and knowledge to the untrained and unscientific mind .

		Many valuable books have been written to give information on this subject to those already interested in it ; this little book is one to awaken an interest where none has yet been felt .

		The ideal method of teaching English is undoubtedly by means of good literature in the hands of a competent teacher ; but competent teachers of English are scarce in the places where they are most needed .

		A careful study of such a book as this in our grammar schools would do much to prepare those who in a few years will be the teachers in our grade schools to guide their pupils into an intelligent interest in words and language .

		Perhaps Miss
Anderson	PERSON	's book may be best described by saying that it is organic , not mechanical , as most books are that deal with stems and prefixes and suffixes for school use .

		Her method insures for words and language the same vital interest that school children feel in natural history and botany when properly taught .

		Beginning with language as a living , growing thing , having its periods of childhood , youth , maturity , and old age , with its family relationships and family resemblances , and going on to trace specifically the growth of the English language , with its various possibilities of combination and modification and their ac - tual outcome , the reader is brought to the difficult and technical matter of roots and stems with a sufficiently living interest to vivify even those dry bones ; much as the student of botany , in tracing processes of plant life and growth , becomes sufficiently enthusiastic to carry over his enthusiasm into the pursuit of botanical names .

		Following the study of deri - vations , which embodies the results of the lat - est linguistic research , are chapters on the growth and change in the meaning of words , on the relative merits of
Saxon	PERSON	and Latin English , on the artist 's and scientist 's use of words , on synonyms and on prose rhythms , which will be welcomed by those teachers who believe , with
Miss Anderson	PERSON	, that the best methods are not too good for our boys and girls , and that the unconscious choice of one word rather than another should be developed at the earliest possible age into intelligent se - lection .

		The result is that while the book is precisely what is needed to supplement the in - dividual work of teachers , it is safe to say that many educated men and women would find in it much to heighten their appreciation of the literature that they now read with pleasure and profit , without knowing why .

		Nowhere else can we find , in as convenient a form , so much that we all ought to know , but that few of us , except special students , do know , about our language .

		And it is all told with a freshness of treatment that will attract the student , and at the same time with a vividness and sympa - thetic appeal that will awaken and hold the interest of any intelligent school boy or girl .

		Miss
Anderson	PERSON	evidently remembers what too many writers for young people forget , that a great many books that we call classics are the favorite books of boys and girls .

		Her '' hope that this elementary work may help toward the time when our boys and girls shall know more of their English tongue , and shall feel increas - ingly the charm and worth of their language inheritance , '' will be echoed with firm assurance by those who see clearly just where this book would have helped them in their own school days .

		The important thing in education is , not to be carried along , but to be started on the right track ; and this interesting and sugges - tive book is admirably planned to start boys and girls , as well as older persons , on the right track in the study of words and literature .

		ESSAYS ON MAN AND DESTINY .

		* One of the striking features of Mr.
Karl Pearson	PERSON	's new volume of '' Studies in
Evolu	LOCATION	- tion '' is the varied character of the '' stud - ies . ''

		It is not lessened by reading the author 's preface .

		In it he says : '' To some readers a few words of explanation on the apparent want of unity in the contents of this book may seem desirable . ''

		The unity which he himself be - lieves exists in them is , '' the endeavour to see all phenomena , physical and social , as a con - nected growth , and describe them as such in the briefest formula possible . ''

		Fully recog - nizing this , and being in hearty sympathy with the author , we still find his matter extremely varied .

		Of a certain series of these essays , mathe - matical in character , '' The Chances of Death '' may be selected as typical .

		It is a study of the mathematical curve of mortality .

		In an ingenious and remarkably readable way , Mr. * THE CHANCES OF DEATH , AND OTHER STUDIES IN EVO - LUTION .

		By
Karl Pearson	PERSON	.

		In two volumes .


New York	LOCATION	:
Edward Arnold	ORGANIZATION	.

		1897 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 219
Pearson	PERSON	calls attention to the peculiarities and components of this curve .

		It is really a com - pound , the resultant of several simple curves , each with its influence .

		The mortality from birth to death does not tell the whole story : the curve extends back of the point of birth , taking in pre-natal death .

		The famous me - diaeval '' dance of death '' is inexact . ''

		Artistically we no longer think of death as striking chaotically : we regard his aim as perfectly regular in the mass , if unpredicable in the individual instance .

		It is no longer the
Dance of Death	ORGANIZATION	which pictures for us Death carrying off indiscriminately the old and the young , the rich and the poor , the toiler and the idler , the babe and its grandsire .

		We see something quite different : the cohort of a thousand tiny mites starting across the Bridge of Life , and growing in stature as they advance , till at the far end of the bridge we see only the graybeard and the ' lean and slippered panta - loon . '

		As they pass along the causeway the throng is more and more thinned .

		Five Deaths are posted at different stages of the route alongside the bridge , and , with different skewness of aim and different weapons of precision , they fire at the human target , till none remain to reach the end of the causeway the limit of life . ''

		To illustrate his conception , the author has caused a quaint and striking picture of the bridge of life to be drawn .

		Of the other purely mathematical essays , `` Variation in Man and Woman '' is most valuable .

		It is commonly stated in anthropo - logical writings that man is more variable than woman .

		Mr.
Havelock Ellis	PERSON	, in `` Man and Woman , '' makes the statement direct and un - qualified , and considers it a matter of prime importance .

		Mr.
Pearson	PERSON	'' lays the axe to the root of this pseudo-scientific superstition . ''

		He presents the most carefully treated mass of data ever dealt with , and outlines a proper mode of examining it .

		Seventeen anthropo - logical characters are investigated , and in eleven of these woman appears to present the greater variation .

		In the important mat - ters of weight , stature , girth , grip , and skull capacity , woman is the more variable .

		This greater variability of woman is attributed to '' her relatively less severe struggle for exist - ence . ''

		In his final conclusion the author makes a fairly vigorous thrust at Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	, saying : '' Those writers who find in this prin - ciple -LSB- man 's greater variability -RSB- , not only ' social and practical consequences of the wid - est significance , ' but also an explanation of the peculiar characteristics ` of the whole of our human civilization , ' are scarcely to be trusted when they deal with the problems of sex . ''

		Whatever the final verdict of science in the matter for our author does not consider his paper exhaustive , the essay is one of the most important that has , for a long time past , ap - peared in physical anthropology .

		The rigid application of mathematics to the theory of natural selection in society and the important discussions of the present anti-science drift of thought , while both interesting and important , may not detain us .

		The clever studies in the second volume , '' Woman as Witch , '' '' Ashiepattle , or
Hans Seeks	PERSON	His Luck , '' `` Kindred Group Marriages , '' `` The German Passion Play , '' demand notice .

		They deal more or less directly with the marvellously instructive mediaevalism of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The first three are studies in customs and words to se - cure survival data of the old '' mother-right . ''

		The last is a study of the matter , spirit , and significance of the great religious drama , '' A Study in the Evolution of Western Christian - ity . ''

		In them all the author shows a wealth of accumulated material and marked originality in treatment .

		His style is terse , clear , and vigorous : himself a radical , a materialist , a socialist , his work is always candid , his treat - ment sympathetic .

		His application of mathe - matics in some fields where it has hitherto been omitted is bound to stop much loose thinking and indefinite statement .

		His work , curious and interesting in its range and varied char - acter , must stimulate workers , for it bears the stamp of honesty and independence .

		RECENT STUDIES IN EDUCATION .

		* One of the most interesting and important books in recent pedagogical literature is Mrs.
Mary R. Ailing	PERSON	-
Aber	PERSON	's '' An Experiment in Education . ''

		The experiment described in this book was made in a primary department in
Boston	LOCATION	, in
1881	DATE	, and the aim of the experiment was '' to see if the child may not be introduced at once to the foundations of all learning the natural and physical sciences , mathe - matics , literature including language , and history and at the same time be given a mastery of such elements of reading , writing , and number as usually constitute primary education .

		220 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, the similar experiment at
Englewood	LOCATION	,
Illinois	LOCATION	, is briefly set forth .

		Bat the bulk of the book is given up to general ideas which these experiments sug - gested , and to remarks on their special application to the teaching of science , history , literature , and so forth .

		The writer believes in giving to children two years old and upward the same mental nourish - ment as to adults , and in doing this '' fearlessly '' ; and her observations and reflections on this matter are of great interest .

		The special value of the book is that it brings out the new ideas on education clearly and definitely on the basis of actual experi - ment ; but the work would have been doubly valu - able if it had been more fully illustrated by example and incident .

		We commend this very original , sound , and suggestive little book to all teachers , and especially to all those in kindergarten and primary grades .

		Another book which ought to be very useful to teachers in every department is '' FroebeFs Educa - tional Laws for all Teachers , '' by Mr.
James L. Hughes	PERSON	.

		The main object of this book is to show that
Froebel	PERSON	's ideas and methods are significant for the whole scheme of education from kindergarten to university .

		This work consists of quotations from
Froebel	PERSON	giving his general ideas on education , with a running exposition and comment partly original with Mr.
Hughes	PERSON	and partly selected .

		There are interesting chapters on
Unity	ORGANIZATION	, Self-Activity , Play , Apperception , Evolution , and so forth .

		The work is uncritical , and perhaps over-eulogistic .

		Though very enthusiastic , it is always sane .

		While Mr.
Hughes	PERSON	has given a serviceable and careful presen - tation of the subject , the book is too scrappy and general ; and there is still need of a very simple work which from abundant examples shall set forth clearly , without any manifold quotations , the Froe - belian principles . ''

		School Management and
School Methods	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Professor
Joseph Baldwin	PERSON	, is an outline manual designed especially for classes of teachers .

		It em - phasises the direct teaching of morals and religion , and is opposed to '' rewards , per-cent marking , formal examinations , and corporal punishment ! ''

		The author discusses educational conditions , facili - ties , school-government , class management , school and college organization , and methods of teaching .

		In the main it is up to date , though under the ac - count of school libraries we do not find any descrip - tion of the traveling-library scheme .

		The style is oral , and very jerky in its repetition of short , abrupt sentences .

		The tone is very enthusiastic , but rather crudely so .

		While as a syllabus the book has some merit , yet there is so much vague and general treat - ment that it will hardly be of the highest value to teachers .

		Further , for such a work the references to the literature of the subject should be far more full and explicit than we find here .

		In Mr.
J. C. Tarver	PERSON	's '' Observations of a Foster Parent '' we have a pleasantly written book whose object is the very praiseworthy one of mediating between the parent and the foster parent or teacher , of making their relation more intelligent and sym - pathetic .

		Mr.
Tarver	PERSON	avows that he has written this book '' chiefly for the sake of earnest and anxious persons who have no means of knowing what is the best thing to do for their children , or of measuring what is being done for them by others . ''

		To this end he has put together some thirty short discursive chapters on studies , methods , pupil 's mind and char - acter , schools , etc. .

		The book is very readable , and contains some shrewd observations .

		But the point of view is ultra-English and conservative , and it would hardly be of much use to the American reader .

		There is certainly room for a first - rate book which shall address the American parent from the most advanced point of American educational progress .

		A book which fulfils this aim in one way with reference to young women is Mrs.
Kate Holliday Claghorn	PERSON	's '' College Training for Women . ''

		This book , by a college woman , on collegiate instruction for women , will be of especial service to parents and intending students , but will also have a considerable interest for the public at large .

		There is sound dis - cussion and advice on such subjects as '' Choosing a College , '' Life at College , '' '' The Graduate Stu - dent , '' `` The College-Trained Mother , '' `` The Col - lege-Woman as a Social Influence '' and `` College Training for the Wage-Earner . ''

		While not very mature in thought or expression , the writer is intel - ligent , earnest , and enthusiastic , and her little book will be of real service in its field .

		Though she does not discuss directly the problem of co-education , her remarks apply both to colleges exclusively for women and to co-educational institutions .


HIRAM M. STANLEY	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		English history down to date .

		Mr.
Justin McCarthy	PERSON	has become his own continuator ; and to his '' His - tory of Our Own Times , '' published in
1878	DATE	, he has added a concluding volume -LRB- Har - per -RRB- , bringing the narrative down to the
Diamond Jubilee	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a delightful book , even if it is not history .

		As might be expected , it is chiefly made up of Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	's recollections and reflections .

		A man who has been a large part of the events he describes can hardly be asked to encumber himself with the paraphernalia of the scientific historian when he means to write a good-humored description of the recent past .

		If one wishes to make oneself conversant with English affairs of the day , there can be no pleasanter method than the reading of so charming a book .

		Perhaps upon occasion one might desire a little more boldness in putting in the darker lines of the picture .

		For example , Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	, in describing the Queen 's Jubilee of
1887	DATE	, is com - pelled to record the fact that
Ireland	LOCATION	had no share in the festivities .

		There is a note of hesitancy and apology in each succeeding sentence , as if he desired
1897	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 221 to minimize the effect of what he is obliged to say .

		Finally , however , his opinion appears , when to the statement that
O'Connell	PERSON	aroused much enthusiasm for the young Queen , he adds : '' The enthusiasm inspired by
O'Connell	PERSON	soon began to chill and die .

		To
Ireland	LOCATION	, the Sovereign became a mere name or a mere myth , for the Crown was only represented by a partisan viceroy , who was changed with each succeeding change of partisan government . ''

		The story of the schism in the
Nationalist	ORGANIZATION	party after Mr.
Parnell	PERSON	was dragged into the divorce court is managed with equal delicacy or deftness , and this is not a little significant , since Mr.
Mc	PERSON	-
Carthy	PERSON	himself was the leader of the men opposed to Mr.
Parnell	PERSON	.

		He speaks of the quarrel only in - cidentally , in stating the time of Mr.
Parnell	PERSON	's death , and does not mention his own connection with the matter ; he merely says : '' The great ma - jority elected a new chairman . ''

		This same quality of charitableness Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	carries into the discussion of
England	LOCATION	's foreign entanglements in
Egypt	LOCATION	, in the
Transvaal	LOCATION	, and with the
United States	LOCATION	about the
Venezuela	LOCATION	boundary line .

		He intimates that '' we can not know what was the real occasion , or inspiration , or purpose of President
Cleveland	LOCATION	's sudden burst of aggressive eloquence . ''

		But the `` eloquence '' was soon over , and Mr.
Cleveland	PERSON	became '' cool , sensible , and conciliatory . ''

		Quite characteristic of Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	's volume are the quiet pauses in the narrative to comment upon poets , orators , scientists , and statesmen , dead since
1878	DATE	.

		The estimates are unusually discriminating .

		They are written in the spirit of one to whom his own life seems a completed work , completed in the days when these men were the companions of his thoughts and his actions .

		Such a writer is not a historian : he has an advantage over the historian .

		Each fact is not something the relations of which he is professionally bound to elucidate : each fact is a part of his own life .

		And yet , unlike the man with an autobiography on his mind , he is able to ignore himself and to pass through his life again incognito .

		A continuation of Th .

		e second volume of Prof.
Moses	PERSON	the literary history Coit Tyler 's ' ' Literary History of the of the Revolution .

		American Revolution '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- has quickly followed the first one .

		The whole work covers the period 1763-1783 , the dividing line be - tween the two volumes falling in
1776	DATE	. ''

		The chief aim of the first volume , '' says the author , '' is to trace the development of political discontent in the
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	- American colonies from about the year
1763	DATE	until the year when that discontent culminated in the resolve for American Independence ; while the chief aim of the second volume is to trace the develop - ment of the Revolutionary struggle under the altered conditions produced by this change in its object and in its character , and to go on with the tale until the year when
American Independence	ORGANIZATION	was formally acknowledged by the British government . ''

		The first period is longer than the second one , and is more abundant in matter ; and the first volume , upon the whole , is more interesting than the second .

		Still , the author has not rigidly observed the line of bisection .

		In the treatment of a few great topics , he has given himself , as he explains , larger room and freer movement than would be possible under a rigorous conformity to the time limits imposed by his general plan .

		Sometimes , no doubt , there are advantages in departing from the rule , as in the cases of
Samuel Adams	PERSON	and Dr.
Franklin	PERSON	; but there is no apparent reason why
Thomas Paine	PERSON	should be bisected , especially as he did not appear on the scene until
1774	DATE	.

		Professor
Tyler	PERSON	still treats the Loyalists liberally , both in space and judgment .

		We miss the compendious statement of his view of the Revolu - tion , which we did not find in the first volume , and which we hoped to find in the present one .

		We still regard its absence as a defect in the work .

		While the new volume is inferior in interest , as a whole , to the first one , it still deals with some of the foremost writers of the time , as
Samuel Adams	PERSON	, Dr.
Franklin	PERSON	,
John Dickinson	PERSON	,
Thomas Paine	PERSON	, and others .

		The chapter on
Franklin	PERSON	is particularly satisfactory .

		The author discovers a likeness between the Amer - ican philosopher and
Socrates	PERSON	, which he insists is more than superficial . ''

		Besides the plebeian origin of both , and some trace of plebeian manners which clung to both , and the strain of animal coarseness from which neither was ever entirely purified , they both had an amazing insight into human nature in all its grades and phases , they were both indifferent to literary fame , they were both humorists , they both applied their great intellectual gifts in a dis - ciplinary but genial way to the improvement of their fellow-men , and in dealing controversially with the opinions of others they both understood and prac - ticed the strategy of coolness , playfulness , an unas - suming manner , moderation of statement , the log - ical parallel , and irony . ''

		The carefully prepared bibliography found in the present volume fills fifty - five pages and contains six hundred titles .

		It is intended to be exhaustive of the printed materials cited in the course of the whole work .

		There is also a good index , while the mechanical execution of the two volumes is worthy of the scholarship and literary merit of their contents .

		The second volume of Mr.
W. J.Court	PERSON	- oetry and h > g History of English Poetry '' houht .

		* '' * j t -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- covers the period from
Wyatt	LOCATION	to
Marlowe	PERSON	.

		It deepens the impression made by the earlier volume , for it is equally a work of much industry , learning , and philosophical grasp .

		In his endeavor '' to trace the course of our Poetry rather by the stream of the national thought and imagination than by that of the national language , '' the author has dragged in a great deal of matter that seems at first sight en - tirely extraneous , and that even reflection can not force into any very direct relation with literary his - tory .

		Before taking up the thread of the history proper , it is found necessary to discuss such subjects English thought .

		222 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, as the Diet of
Augsburg	LOCATION	, the decay of chivalry , the '' Prince '' of
Machiavelli	ORGANIZATION	, and the '' Colloquies '' of
Erasmus	LOCATION	.

		These matters , and the extensive quo - tations everywhere introduced , make a very stout volume , although a period of only about seventy - five years is covered .

		Upon such a scale as this , the work should require eight or ten more volumes for its completion .

		We regret to say that Mr.
Courthope	PERSON	is more solid than readable .

		Whether it be from native defect , or from professionalism prepense , his work is lacking in animation , and re - mains , for the most part , upon a rather low level of expression .

		Occasionally , however , the reader is rewarded by such a bit of impassioned rhetoric as we find in the following noble passage : '' The his - tory of ideas has in it something of the solemnity of tragic action .

		As the chant of the monks on the Capitol called up in the imagination of the historian the long drama of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire , so the monuments of architecture , painting , sculpture , and poetry record the dynastic revolutions in the march of human thought .

		Hu - miliating in many respects to our pride is the scene of waste , change , and decay that such a retrospect discloses .

		Conceits and affectations elevated into the chief aims of poetry ; the idols of beauty con - founded with its true forms ; experiments in lan - guage conducted at the expense of thought ; vain though noble attempts made to reanimate exhausted ideals ; admiration lavished on the shadows rather than the substance of art such are the ruins that will encounter us in this period of our history , like the fallen temples , tombs , and aqueducts that sad - den the memories of the traveller in the
Roman Campagna	PERSON	. ''

		The literature of criminology rap - Studies of crime .11 .

		ldl 7 increases .

		A little book before us , `` Crime and Criminals , '' by Dr.
J. Sanderson Christison	PERSON	-LRB-
Chicago	LOCATION	:
W. T. Keener Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is composed , as we are told in the preface , largely of a series of articles contributed to the `` Chicago Tribune '' under the caption of `` Jail Types . ''

		The literary style of the book is that of the daily newspaper .

		The author 's design seems to be to present the criminal in the light of study and modern science .

		A number of cases , repre - senting a wide range of criminal types , are briefly described and illustrated by portraits reproduced from photographs .

		It is frequently assumed that the reader is fully informed regarding the crime and criminal discussed , and thus the description given is too incomplete and scrappy to be of value .

		The author 's wording is often obscure and some - times incorrect .

		It is not clear that he plainly un - derstands the use of the words so fundamental heredity , degeneration , environment .

		It is certain that he does not understand the use of the word specie .

		The real value of the book lies in the fact that it presents cases of
Chicago	LOCATION	criminals , of many or most of whom the local public has heard .

		A scientific verdict upon these cases can not fail to be suggestive to thinking men .

		Dr.
Christison	PERSON	has apparently collected a good deal of material ; it is a pity that he has not more carefully presented it .

		Apart from the portraits , the illustrations in the book have no great value .

		Thus , the plates of jaw forms recognized by Dr.
Talbot	PERSON	, of brains brutes , normal human beings , and criminals and of the degenerate ear , would have value if they had been adequately discussed and described .

		Readers are of two classes : they are beginners who need first principles , or more advanced students who have al - ready gained them .

		To the former these plates are worthless because not discussed ; to the latter they are unnecessary because already known .

		According to Mr.
Charles Dudley	PERSON	*
Warner	ORGANIZATION	, more insight into Shakes - peare 's plays is to be gained by studying the
England	LOCATION	of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's day than from the whole race of commentators and critics of the text .

		In the light of contemporary English life , its visions of empire , its spirit of adventure , its piracy , exploration , and warlike turmoil , its credu - lity and superstitions , its wonder at natural phe - nomena , its implicit belief in the supernatural , its faith , its daring , its coarseness of speech , bluntness of manner , luxury of apparel , and ostentation of wealth , the mobility of its shifting society , in such a light the dramas glow with a new meaning , and awaken a profounder admiration of the poet 's knowledge of human life .

		To these matters , there - fore , Mr.
Warner	PERSON	devotes his little book on '' The People for Whom Shakespeare Wrote '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- .

		His authorities are such old and not commonly available writers as
Harrison	PERSON	,
Stubbes	LOCATION	,
Stowe	PERSON	, and
Holinshed	LOCATION	; and it must be granted that he has used their musty pages to great advantage in making his breezy and picturesque summary .

		The reproduc - tions of such quaint old pictures as '' A Puritan Family , '' `` A
Supper	DATE	Party , '' `` A Family Group , '' and ''
William Kemp	PERSON	Dancing '' add not a little to the charm of the narrative .

		A drawing of the Swan Theatre , made in
1596	DATE	, gives one an exact idea of the places where our ancestors contrived to spend so much of their time , on various pretexts .

		Not only was it their resort for pleasure , but also their resource in sorrow .

		As the Italians sleep away grief , the French sing , and the Germans drink , so the English of the sixteenth century went to plays to be rid of it .

		If only this play-going crowd had had the foresight to leave us some au - thentic account of their greatest playwright , how much guess-work we should have been spared !

		The right kind of Miss
Margaret Warner Morley	PERSON	has Nature-studies presented to child-students some de - for children .

		Hghtful studies of '' A Few Familiar Flowers '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- .

		There are only five of the flow - ers the morning-glory , jewel weed , nasturtium , geranium , and hyacinth .

		We all presume that we have known these everyday flowers for a lifetime .

		Many of us have gone through the botanies in our
1897	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 22S school-days and analyzed hundreds of wild flowers , dried them perhaps , and mounted them in the herbarium .

		Yet there are curious facts in the structure of these '' familiar flowers '' culled by
Miss Morley	PERSON	which few of us have ever dreamed of .

		She takes her little people to the spot where the flower grows , and teaches them how to look at it , how to view it in all its aspects , and how to search for the meaning and the cause of each peculiarity .

		When they have finished their study , they know their plant in every external feature ; and , more than that , they have acquired the art of clear and accurate observation .

		Miss
Morley	PERSON	has a charming gift for talking with children , in language apt and elegant , yet simple and natural as that of the child she addresses .

		In '' Flowers and Their Friends '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB-
Miss Morley	PERSON	continues the study of plant - life along the same lines pursued in the work above mentioned .

		The same flowers are treated , with added information regarding their peculiar features .

		In a second division of the book , under the head of '' Stories about all Sorts of Things , '' a simple ac - count is given of the structure and uses of cells , pollen , nectar , and other vital parts of the flower .

		In all Miss
Morley	PERSON	's books the illustrations are a notable attraction , the graceful way in which they are thrown around and across the text arresting the eye with pleasing effects .

		When two writers of marked ability in both to 6 * '' and natural his - tory unite to produce a work giving scope to their special talents , the public has reason to expect a masterpiece of its kind .

		In the ''
Citi	ORGANIZATION	- zen Bird '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mrs.
Mabel Osgood Wright	PERSON	and Dr.
Elliott Coues	PERSON	, this expectation is real - ized .

		Seldom is the plan of a book so admirably conceived and in every detail so excellently ful - filled .

		The volume is designed to win young people to a love of the birds , and presents its mat - ter in the form of a story , which from beginning to end never falters in interest .

		One knows not whether most to applaud the ingenuity manifest in the varied scenes , the wit that enlivens them all , or the enticing manner in which information of a solid character is inserted in the narrative .

		Over a hundred birds are introduced , and their portraits are given in black and white by Mr.
Louis Agassiz Fuertes	PERSON	, a young artist whose original and striking transcripts of bird-life are exciting mingled wonder and delight among ornithologists .

		The Spanish Mission * of
California	LOCATION	.

		Catching a glimpse of a book with the title '' The Missions of
California	LOCATION	: Their Establishment , Progress , and Decay '' -LRB-
William Doxey	PERSON	,
San Francisco	LOCATION	-RRB- , the re - viewer who knows anything of the possibilities of that subject is apt to drop everything else and reach out after that book , with the thought that the one long waited for has come at last .

		For full justice has never yet been done to the religious settlements along the
Pacific	LOCATION	coast , which colonized and evan - gelized that portion of our land while furnishing a barrier to the inroads of foreigners from the west , and which grafted some Spanish institutions upon our Anglo-Saxon civilization .

		The author of the small book before us ,
Miss Laura Bride Powers	ORGANIZATION	, had access to the materials for such a history , `` manuscripts , including diaries , mission registers , and personal letters '' ; and there can be no doubt of her sympathy with the subject a sympathy rising , in fact , to an enthusiasm .

		We are debarred from feeling disappointment that she has not given us just the book we want , by her motives in writing what she has written .

		This book '' might well have gone forth to its destiny known as ' A Plea for the Missions , 1 '' so says the preface ; and the author lias told the tale of their ascendancy and ruin , '' hoping thereby to enlist sympathy in the cause of their restoration and preservation . ''

		The book contains very brief accounts of the several Missions , is beau - tifully printed , admirably illustrated with half-tone views , and is appropriately bound ; and we hope it may result , as its author so fondly trusts , in awaken - ing an increased interest in those monuments along our western coast that mark one of the most pictur - esque phases of the colonization of our land .

		The study of `` English Lyric Poetry , 1500-1700 , '' English lyric edited by Dr.
Frederick Ives	PERSON	Car - P etr y - penter , is the latest volume in the `` Warwick Library '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , and the only vol - ume thus far contributed to the series by an Amer - ican scholar .

		Dr.
Carpenter	PERSON	's introduction of nearly fifty pages traces the development of the English lyric from the earliest times to the close of the Restoration period , and is a study both subtle and scholarly .

		The selections , which run from
Skelton	PERSON	to
Dryden	PERSON	, are made with unfailing taste ; the edi - tor has ransacked the abundant modern literature of the subject , and set side by side with the familiar songs many unfamiliar but almost equally beautiful pieces .

		We can never agree with him in attributing '' Roses , their sharp spines being gone '' to
Fletcher	PERSON	, but this is our only quarrel with an editor whose taste and whose thorough knowledge of the subject alike command respect .

		Dr.
Carpenter	PERSON	has also published , at the
University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	, an `` Outline Guide to the Study of English Lyric Poetry , '' which every teacher of English literature will be glad to have .

		It covers the entire history of the subject , and provides thousands of references for the student , besides a helpful body of sugges - tions for the use of the instructor .

		Dr.
Carpenter	PERSON	has made the subject of the English lyric peculiarly his own , and his work is a distinct credit to
Ameri	LOCATION	- can scholarship .

Oct. 16	DATE	, scholars have contributed so much to our knowl - edge of Roman history that not to know German would seem , in this instance , to indicate ignorance of the principal authorities on the subject of the essay .

		The many and accurate references to
Latin	LOCATION	, French , and English authorities show , however , that the author has written with scholarly care .

		A fine presentation of conditions existing in
Rome	LOCATION	and in
Carthage	LOCATION	, just previous to
Hannibal	LOCATION	's campaigns , is followed by a clear account of the various battles and military movements , so far as it is possible to know them .

		The author 's language is well chosen , and were it not for the repetition of certain forms of expression the descriptive bits of writing would be very good reading .

		The book has a good index and is well supplied with maps .

		Its plan embraces field and class work , both arranged with a view to combining the attractive fea - tures of the study and an exact and thorough pursuit of it .

		The text is written in a simple though serious style , and is accompanied with a multitude of engravings , many of them original , and all examples of the finest workmanship . ''

		THE admirable distinctness and singleness of purpose that mark this new periodical find expression in its title .

		Literature , and literature alone , is to be its theme .

		The aim of its publishers will be to make it essentially the organ of the literary classes in the widest sense of the term , impartial and authoritative in its literary criticism , and a comprehensive and trust - worthy medium of literary intelligence .

		An earnest and an honest attempt will be made to deal with the best literature of every country on its literary merits alone , without prejudice , without national prepossessions .

		To English and to American works a certain prominence will almost inevi - tably be given ; but this natural preference will not exclude reviews of the more important of the volumes issuing from the publishing centres on the continent of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Though Literature will consist mainly of reviews of books , it will invite correspondence on and will itself deal with any literary subject of permanent or of current interest to the writing , publish - ing , or reading world .

		The rule of anonymity will be generally observed in its reviews , though not with unvarying strictness ; and a refreshing novelty is suggested in the statement that every endeavor will be made to find room for the proper expression of adverse views over the signature of any correspondent .

		It is proposed to publish weekly , or as often as the occasion may arise , a bibliog - raphy of some topic of the time , in order to furnish the reader with a list of all the works which can be consulted on the subject .

		The record of new publications will be made as complete as possible , but in the selection of books for review the editor will be guided solely by his judgment of their literary value .

		This seems to be , or should seem to be , a matter of course , but , in point of fact , it is a noteworthy innovation , for the practice of indiscriminately reviewing , or , at any rate , noticing , every book which issues from the press is one which , by the stimulus it affoids to the pro- duction of worthless work , is tending seriously to the degradation of literary standards and to the confusion and disgust of readers .

		Instead of giving to books which are unworthy of any notice at all the help of even a scathing criticism , Literature will apply to them the far more effective treat - ment of neglect .

		On the other hand , it is hoped that every important work may be reviewed within three weeks after its publication .

		Evidently Literature , by virtue of its definite and undeviating aim , has a field all its own a very useful arid a liberal field to work in and to prosper in .

		And not less evidently it has that indispensable thing the positive character which appears to be a prime condition of success in the equipment of a publication not less , or scarcely less , than in the career of an individual .

		The selection of Mr.
H. D. TKAILL	PERSON	as editor of Literature finds its warrant in the broad critical faculty and masculine sanity of judgment which characterize that well-known writer .

		Mr.
BARRETT WENDELL	PERSON	, Assistant Professor of English at
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	, will contribute a weekly letter upon topics of literary interest in
America	LOCATION	.

		258 THE YERKES OBSERVATORY .

		The characteristic ambition of
Chicago	LOCATION	to do whatever it attempts upon a bigger scale than it has ever been done before has just been grati - fied in a very conspicuous way .

		That ambition has often been ignoble enough as to its aims , and accompanied by self-laudation of an amount and a quality calculated to excite the derision rather than the respect of the outside world .

		When , through the medium of its blatant news - paper press or the windy outpourings of its public speakers , it has cackled over such things as its Great Fire , or the number of square miles covered by its territory , or the census of its inhabitants , or the millions of its slaughtered hogs , its more judicious citizens have hung their heads , and felt that such things should rather be taken for granted than expressed , and that the consciousness of their truth were most fitly accompanied by an eloquent silence .

		But when the chorus of self-congratulation has for its theme the largest library circulation in the world or the most generous American expendi - ture for public schools , the richest of university endowments or the most magnificent of interna - tional exhibitions , something may be pardoned the effusiveness which is so eager to proclaim these facts to the rest of mankind , and the worthiness of the aims thus realized may partly justify the spirit in which they are heralded .

		Certainly , if
Chicago	LOCATION	ever had adequate cause for blowing its own trumpet in the old ear - piercing fashion , such cause is provided by the superb astronomical observatory , equipped with the largest refracting telescope thus far made , and manned by a corps of the most bril - liant investigators in the country , which has been given to the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	by the munificence of Mr.
Charles T. Yerkes	PERSON	, and which was dedicated to the uses of research by the elaborate ceremonies of week before last .

		Few such gatherings of distinguished men of science as then assembled at
Chicago	LOCATION	and
Lake Geneva	LOCATION	have ever been brought together in this country , and none has ever taken part in the inauguration of a more auspicious scientific enterprise .

		The great telescope which was the real hero of this occasion represents several years of the 238 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, most expert mechanical workmanship .

		At the World 's Fair of
1893	DATE	, the giant tube , tempo - rarily mounted , was one of the most conspicu - ous of the exhibits , while the lenses had already been cast and were being ground in the
Alvan Clark	PERSON	establishment whence have issued most of the objectives for the great telescopes of the world .

		During the past two or three years the Romanesque observatory with its imposing dome , the design of Mr.
Henry Ives Cobb	PERSON	, has been rearing its massive walls upon the hilly shore of the picturesque
Wisconsin	LOCATION	lake .

		Sit - uated within a two - hours ' railway journey from the city , the
Yerkes Observatory	ORGANIZATION	is now an integral part of
the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, and has entered upon its career as a factor in as - tronomical research .

		A quarter of a century ago , the old
Chicago University	ORGANIZATION	owned the largest telescope objective that had then been produced the eighteen and one-half inch
Clark	PERSON	lens of the
Dearborn Observatory	ORGANIZATION	.

		Since then , the scale of achievement in this delicate field of the art mechanical has risen , almost inch by inch , until a new landmark of progress has been set by the clear forty inches of aper - ture disclosed by the new instrument .

		As com - pared with the thirty-six inch lens of the Lick instrument , the Yerkes telescope has a light - gathering power nearly twenty-five per cent greater , while the astronomers in charge make the gratifying statement that the site proves better than had been anticipated .

		This highly important consideration is stated by President
Harper	PERSON	in the following terms : '' The atmospheric conditions at night are frequently very fine indeed .

		The best seeing here is not surpassed by the best seeing at the
Lick Observatory	ORGANIZATION	, though in the course of a year there would be more good nights at
Mount Hamilton	LOCATION	.

		The atmospheric conditions dur - ing the day are much superior to those of the
Lick Observatory	ORGANIZATION	.

		The conditions for solar work , consider - ing both instruments and atmosphere , are probably much better than those enjoyed by any other observa - tory . ''

		At the new observatory , then , all the essen - tial conditions for investigation of the most fruitful kind seem to be met .

		But the wonder - loving public can not be too frequently warned that no discoveries of a sensational character are to be expected even from such an astro - nomical equipment as that now provided .

		Ele - phants in the moon will be seen in the future , as in the past , by the eyes of humorous poets alone , and the doings of the Martians will still remain to be chronicled exclusively by the ro - mancers .

		As a member of the staff remarked the other day , science does not take kindly to that sort of thing .

		What the observatory shall accomplish will fall within certain well-defined lines of research , and its work will be uninspir - ing save to those in close touch with the pro- gress of astronomical science .

		There will be many additions to the catalogue of double stars , many new companions of familiar luminaries detected , many delicate micrometrical measure - ments recorded , and many spectra photographed for examination .

		It is possible that one or two new satellites may be found somewhere at the outposts of our planetary system , that certain vexatious problems of rotation may be solved , and that we may considerably increase our knowledge of the sun 's physical constitution .

		The accumulation of these kinds of facts does not appeal to the popular imagination , but , on the other hand , such facts appeal with the greatest force to the trained astronomer , be - cause it is by their means that he hopes , at some time in the dim future , to arrive at some sort of solution of the vastest of all scientific problems that of the constitution of the physical universe .

		Truth is , that the real astronomy of to-day is so unlike the notion of astronomy as it exists in the popular consciousness that the layman and the professional hardly speak the same language , and that conversation between them upon the subject is largely a game of cross - purposes .

		The older astronomy , as popular - ized by such men as
Mitchell	PERSON	and
Proctor	PERSON	, is well-nigh a closed chapter in the history of the science , and with it the modern observatory has little concern .

		In the old observatory the tele - scope was everything ; in the new , the spectro - scope and the photographic camera are at least its rivals .

		But it was the old astronomy that made possible the new , and that in more ways than the obvious one of providing the science with its framework of gross facts .

		The appeal of the old astronomy to the popular imagina - tion was , and continues to be , very great , and it is precisely through the force of that appeal that national observatories have been estab - lished and private endowments like that which now engages our attention have been made .

		In this respect , indeed , astronomy has been the favored child in the household of the sciences .

		And if its returns to knowledge have not been in the kind for which its benefactors have vaguely hoped , they have been of a value far exceeding anything that could have been antici - pated a generation ago .

		In the fine address with which Professor
Simon Newcomb	PERSON	closed the ceremonies of the
1897	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 239 week devoted to the dedication of the
Yerkes Observatory	ORGANIZATION	, he said , among other things : '' Gentlemen of the trustees , allow me to commend to your fostering care the men at the end of the tele - scope .

		The constitution of the astronomer shows curious and interesting features .

		If he is destined to advance the science of works of real genius he must , like the poet , be born , not made .

		The born astronomer , when placed in command of a telescope , goes about using it as naturally and effectively as the babe avails itself of its mother 's breast .

		He sees intuitively what less gifted men have to learn by long study and tedious experi - ment .

		He is moved to celestial knowledge by a passion which dominates his nature .

		He can no more avoid doing astronomical work , whether in the line of obser - vations or research , than the poet can chain his
Pegasus	ORGANIZATION	to earth .

		I do not mean by this that education and training will be of no use to him .

		They will certainly accelerate his early progress .

		If he is to become great on the mathematical side , not only must his genius have a bend in that direction , but he must have the means of pursuing his studies .

		And yet I have seen so many failures of men who had the best instruction , and so many successes of men who scarcely learned anything of their teachers , that I sometimes ask whether the great American celestial mechanician of the twentieth century will be a graduate of a university or of the backwoods . ''

		These remarks have a peculiar fitness upon the present occasion , for the three men at the head of the new observatory are born astronomers , if such there ever were .

		Professor
Barnard	PERSON	, when at
Mount Hamilton	LOCATION	, showed how '' natur - ally and effectively '' he could use a great tele - scope , and his discovery of the fifth satellite of
Jupiter	ORGANIZATION	made his fame secure for the coming centuries .

		Professor
Hale	PERSON	was '' moved to celestial knowledge by a passion which domi - nates his nature , '' for he was hardly more than a boy when , in his own private observatory , he made discoveries and perfected methods that attracted the attention of astrophysicists all over the world .

		And Professor Burn ham is a shining example of the '' successes of men who scarcely learned anything of their teachers , '' for , with no other means of investigation than a modest six - inch glass , and no other time than the hours left him from his duties as a law reporter , he made for himself a score of years ago an international reputation in his chosen field of work the investigation of double stars .

		The observatory that has at its com - mand the services of three such men as these may well face the future with hopeful eyes .

		And when to the men the equipment is added , the prospects of the institution are indeed en - viable , and justify the eagerness with which astronomers everywhere are awaiting the re - ports that the coming years are to bring from the shores of the
Wisconsin	LOCATION	lake .

		MAGIC LINES .

		Among the uncollected curiosities of our national literature might be found a fragment by an un - printed poet of our vanished
Bohemia	LOCATION	.

		As nearly as I can remember , the effusion was as follows : `` Oh , I 'd weave some mystic , magic line of scriven , Whose meaning , when unriven , Would be like words from Heaven A clue to millions driven In this tangled maze of woe .

		Ah , would I might do this , before I go ! ''

		And a brother Bohemian of
Pfaff	PERSON	's exclaimed : '' Scriven ?

		What 's scriven ? ''

		I shall not be so fastidious as regards my poet 's diction , for I hold myself indebted to him for a text ; and I think the entire race of verse-makers owes him an obligation for voicing the pathetic ambition of their guild to leave behind at least one '' mystic magic '' line that the world can not forget , even if its meaning be never wholly unriven .

		I wish here to refer briefly to sundry famous lines , in our own language chiefly , whose signifi - cance to the world at large would seem to transcend the author 's conscious intention .

		The poet Camp - bell , in a burst of confidential candor , assures us , while lauding another art , that '' 111 can poetry express Fall many a tone of thought sublime . ''

		I am inclined to think he builded better than he knew , in making this admission , since in the order of verse under consideration there is imparted to expressions , apparently simple in themselves , a gla - mour as potent , as inexplicable , as that implied by him who asks '' Hast thou a charm to stay the morning star ? ''

		There are lines like the one just quoted , whose effect is not to be accounted for by any known laws of construction .

		Not only does poetry ill express certain tones of thought , but in many instances it does not express them at all : it merely suggests a state of mind , which , on being induced , weaves a sorcerer 's web of mystery , all the more sensible because it is invisible .

		We are , as it were , spirited away to
Milton	LOCATION	's realm , '' Of forests and enchantments drear , Where more is meant than meets the ear . ''

		But the few lines imbued with this ultra significance come so seldom in the course of ordinary reading , that one would be tempted to attribute them to accident , were it not that it is the privilege of poetry to claim for itself a scheme of predestination , a true poet resenting the mastership of chance as utterly as does the theologian .

		And yet we are in many cases left to conjecture whether the author himself was aware of the wizard quality of his own work , especially as these magic utterances are seldom found ornament - ing a production of transcendent merit or one that evinces great ambition on the part of the author .

		Such , and thus undistinguished by position , are the following '' mystic magic lines of scriven '' : '' The desire of the moth for the star , Of the night for the morrow . ''

		THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, These form part of a fugitive poem which but for them would pass unnoticed .

		Indeed ,
Shelley	PERSON	may be considered the arch-seer of such lyric necromancy , and more than once has his muse veiled herself in a garment of woven wind , like the lady in '' Alastor , '' and more than once hath his
Pegasus	ORGANIZATION	'' trod the dim winds . ''

		The latter phrase has always seemed to me to induce this feeling of glamour , to which all
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	's translucent metaphors , in more or less degree , lend themselves .

		It is as though in some other life we should attain to such exquisiteness of vision and sensibility , that the air , which to our mortal perception is invisible , should be merely '' dim . ''

		Take another instance , the line from Wordsworth : '' The light that never was on sea or land . ''

		This collection of words hints to us vaguely of some - thing whereof we know but vaguely to wit , genius .

		Yet this beautiful line , which has sunk into the hearts of millions , and which is quoted as one of the evidences of that factor which it hesitates to define , occurs in a sonnet '' On a Picture of
Peel Castle	ORGANIZATION	in a Storm , '' neither the subject , the artist 's treat - ment , nor the occasion , having been regarded as of especial consequence .

		Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	has contributed his quota of magic lines ; but they , though just as mysterious as those of
Shelley	LOCATION	, are less veiled in tender imagery .

		What nameless splendors of the illimitable and the un - known are conjured up by the opening line of ''
Hesperia	LOCATION	'' : '' Out of the golden , remote , wild West , where the sea without shore is . ''

		What sense of the deadly mystery of fate is em - bodied in that other line : '' Who swims in sight of the great ninth wave , which never a swimmer shall cross or climb . ''

		A strong line , even though it were mere words carry - ing no clear-cut significance to the mind .

		Again , how rich in mysterious suggestion the passage de - scriptive of Proserpina : `` Pale , beyond porch and portal , Crowned with calm leaves she stands . ''

		After deducting all the influence of alliteration , and allowing for the sombre grandeur of movement , how much that is wholly inexplicable in magic effect remains !

		Of an order less vast and comprehensive , yet still gloomily picturesque , may be cited the lines from
Campbell	ORGANIZATION	: `` And heard across the wave 's tumultuous roar , The wolf 's long howl from
Oonalaska	LOCATION	's shore . ''


Lockhart	PERSON	says of this couplet , that many of the music-lovers of his day were wont to repeat these lines often , just to fill the ear with the mere mel - ody thereof ; but we contend that there is in the effect of these verses something more than music , something more than picture , some magic of the supersense .

		There is now and then found , among the occa - sional verse of the day , a stray lyric possessing no plan or purpose commensurate with the effect pro- duced , which is one of weird fascination .

		The whole poem might be considered as a continuous `` magic line . ''

		One such has become widely known and is fre - quently copied ,
Bourdillon	PERSON	's enchanting fragment , `` The night has a thousand eyes . ''

		A yet more eminent example in the same line is Tennyson 's '' Break , break , break '' ; constructed of the commonest words , embodying a common senti - ment , all thrown loosely together like the storm - tossed rocks the poet describes , yet the total effect is one of infinite tenderness and vague regret , a very mirage of the soul .

		There is heard in it the wail of the deep sea , such as ages ago Sophocles heard in the .

		ZEgean , and later was heard on
Dover Beach	LOCATION	by
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	.

		There are many of us who know nothing of some foreign language save one masterly phrase or line which filters into our consciousness half unaware , and conveys to us some hint of the miracle of Pen - tecost -LRB- with all reverence be it said -RRB- whereby the gift of alien tongues avails for a single instance .

		A very scant knowledge of German suffices to fill the mind with a sense of weird revery , on reading such poems as , say , `` The Lorelei '' of
Heine	LOCATION	, or that darker measure , '' The Erl King '' of Goethe .

		Of the latter poem , the force of the last four syl - lables , '' Das Kind war todt , '' is as of four magic words used as an incantation .

		It is a trick of some German reciters to drop these four words with a solemn death-like emphasis ; and this effect was more than reproduced by the conjurer 's forefinger of
Rubinstein	LOCATION	, in playing the music .

		Take one more instance the sorrowful burden of poor
Gretchen	PERSON	's lament , ''
Nimmer	PERSON	mehr . ''

		The spell of immortal melancholy , cast by this haunting refrain , meets us again in Shelley 's '' No more , oh never - more ! ''

		in Byron 's '' No more , no more , oh nevermore on me The freshness of the heart can fall like dew , '' and again in '' The Raven '' of
Poe	PERSON	.

		Turning to the poetry of the ancients , that classic period just preceding the Christian era , we find one of the most celebrated passages in all literature the reference to Marcellus in the '' .3 Cneid '' of Virgil : `` Manibus date lilia plenis , Purpnreos spargam flores , '' Wet with the dew of a pitying heaven and a mourn - ing maternity , the odor of those purpureos flores has passed down the centuries , and the source of its weird intoxication has never been divined .

		But , notwithstanding many passages of exquisite beauty , the Latin tongue does lend itself rather to the clear - cut definiteness of epigram than to lines of illusive magic .

		The Greek , however , abounds in instances illustrative of our subject .

		For nearly thirty cen - turies there have dwelt in the minds and hearts of men a few lines from the surviving work of
Sappho	ORGANIZATION	.

		During all those centuries her poetry has been ac - cepted without question or comment save of delight and wonder .

		We need only refer to the Hesperus : for sweet as is the hour she celebrates , never , in all the years since , have the wistful witcheries of sound and the yearning penumbra of sight been so brought

		Yet who can say how this is accomplished ?

		Anyone familiar with the theory of isomeric compounds will have noted the extraordinary fact that many substances exactly identical in chemical composition display , in their effect , results the most dissimilar .

		Take the most exquisite of all perfumes , that which has given poetry to Araby the Blest , the atar-gul of
Turkey	LOCATION	: the attar of roses .

		Careful analysis shows this substance to be precisely iden - tical with turpentine .

		The cause of the difference in result remains one of the mysteries of science .

		If accounted for at all , it is by methods as fantastic as the assumption of unlikeness in the adjustment of molecular atoms .

		Turpentine is one of the cheapest and most abundant of substances known to the manufacturer , attar of rose one of the most costly and difficult to obtain of all merchandise .

		Could some second-sight espy the cause of difference between the two substances , the happy discoverer would master a transmutation more profitable than was ever dreamed of by alembic .

		And the same might be said of word-magic , as compared with mere words -

		THE CRERAR LIBRARY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		As a former resident of
Chicago	LOCATION	, I desire to express my appreciation of your tribute to the
Chicago Public Library	ORGANIZATION	in your issue of
October 16	DATE	.

		It is eminently just and well deserved .

		Your remarks in the same article concerning the other libraries of
Chicago	LOCATION	also seem to me to be most discriminating .

		Your incidental mention , however , of the fact that the
Crerar Library	ORGANIZATION	is now '' of interest only to students of science '' suggests a point in that connection that concerns many of your readers and the people of
Chicago	LOCATION	generally .

		It is that Mr.
Crerar	PERSON	unquestionably intended that the contents of the library should consist mainly and primarily of literature spe - cially fitted to create and sustain high moral sentiment in the community , to diffuse an atmosphere of refine - ment , and to build up character .

		No intelligent and unbiased person reading the provisions of Mr.
Crerar	PERSON	's will on that point , as on record and published , can escape that conclusion .

		His declarations and directions to that effect are clear and unmistakable .

		Now , unless it can be shown that a library of purely scientific literature is better calculated than any other to impart this moral and aesthetic culture , and build up character , it must be acknowledged that to establish such a library exclusively on the
Crerar	PERSON	foundation would be to proceed directly contrary to the require - ments of the instrument from which every atom of au - thority to act in the matter is derived .

		No attempt , so far as the writer knows , has ever been made to show that an exclusively scientific library will in this case best accomplish the objects mentioned .

		Such an attempt would be , at least , interesting to observe .

		But , whether such endeavor be made or not , I think that most persons who are fitted to judge will continue to believe that the proper material with which to pro- duce the results desired by Mr.
Crerar	PERSON	is literature of the highest and best kind ; `` the best that has been thought and said in the world '' ; such literature as refines and elevates the taste , holds lofty ideals before the imagination , and fires the heart with high enthu - siasms ; `` the literature of power '' rather than the '' literature of information '' which seeks merely to communicate bare cold facts .

		May it not be hoped that the trustees of the
Crerar Library	ORGANIZATION	will yet decide to add to the library a good proportion of literature of this kind sooner or later ?


T. V. V. Brooklyn	PERSON	,
N.Y.	LOCATION	,
October 20 , 1897	DATE	.

		-LSB- At the time when the plans of the
Crerar Library	ORGANIZATION	- were under discussion , we were of the opinion expressed in the above communication , and urged that opinion upon the trustees .

		But while we con - sider their decision to have been an unfortunate one , we have no doubt that they acted conscien - tiously , taking into account both what they believed to be the best interests of the public and what they thought were the intentions of the testator .

		The - situation was , moreover , made more complex than it would otherwise have been by the existence of two other large public libraries , and the consequent importance of such a division of the field of activity as should reduce duplication and waste of effort to a minimum .

		At any rate the question is no longer open for discussion , since the
Crerar Library	ORGANIZATION	has already gone so far in its chosen direction as to make reconsideration impossible .

		ART AND LIFE . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Mr.
Hale	PERSON	touches an all-important question in THE DIAL of
October 1	DATE	, but except for the hint in the phrase '' that literature may be the breath of life to the spirit , '' does not answer it let us hope , because he intends to do so elsewhere .

		It will be worth while to turn to page 177 of the same number of THE DIAL , and consider these words from the pen of Mr.
Charles Leonard Moore	PERSON	, making no mental change except to amplify the word '' think '' by the phrase `` think and absorb '' : 242 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, '' Man must think , or sink to the level of the animals ... Granted that the problems that rise about us are insolvable by any system of speculation , yet by facing them man will at least realize his soul , which by forgetting them will die out of him . ''

		This , when read in the light of Professor
L. A. Sher	PERSON	- man 's definition of literature , '' Anything deemed worth thinking again , or experiencing again , and preserved , no matter how , with such intention or expectation , '' suggests a theory of `` the relation of art to life '' ; for it must have been a character so shaped that
Ben Jonson	PERSON	had in mind when he wrote : '' I judge him of a rectified spirit , By many revolutions of discourse -LRB- In his bright reason 's influence -RRB- refined From all the tartarous moods of common men ; Bearing the nature and similitude Of a right heavenly bodie ; most severe In fashion and collection of himself e , And then as cleare and confident as Jove . ''

		An old farmer , broken down by rheumatism , once said to me : '' The only reading a young man needs is the reading of his Bible on
Sundays	DATE	, after working hard from daybreak to dark six days in the week . ''

		Extreme and exceptional , no doubt ; but the spirit is not . ''

		Faith , attainment , realization , '' or '' Success , the measure of achievement , '' these are the cries , according as one is exclusively religious or exclusively worldly .

		Being a positive people , we are generally either one or the other .

		The latter position needs no discussion here .

		For an illustration of the former , turn again to the same number of THE DIAL , page 187 , the last poetical quo - tation .

		Absolute faith being so commonly held up as the ideal , it is not strange that things called by other names , though they constitute the soul itself , should be considered of secondary worth .

		Not that the quotation does not contain a truth ; but ninety-nine out of every hundred will read into it the moral '' Tu volont ^ soit faite , '' before , instead of after , '' le possible humain , `` and will rejoice to look down upon '' L'Art ... enrichi de ses efforts utiles , '' in other words , will view with con - tempt the bridge that enables them to cross the stream .

		It is equally necessary to accompany the souls of former days through The
City of Dreadful Night	ORGANIZATION	and The Realm of Glorious Day ; otherwise we may , for lack of preparation , be overwhelmed when the shadows come , as come they will , or when the horizon is widened or narrowed in spite of the inclination .

		Faith with eyes open is to be opposed to faith with eyes closed .

		What else will strengthen us so to do but art , with its moral truth and human passion '' touched with a certain large - ness , sanity , and attraction of form '' ?

		The problem of its relation to life disappears when we realize that art is life itself , merely concentrated ; none the less true because '' Calm pleasures there abide , majestic pains ; ... more pellucid streams , An ampler ether , a diviner air , And fields invested with purpureal gleams , '' or because at times it presents '' Shadows and shoals that edge eternity , '' `` Loco d'ogni luce muto , Che mngghia come fa mar per tempesta Se da contrarii venti e combattuto , '' ; for these things constitute our living , when we look beyond the intervening periods of apathy .

		So far as may be , art is the sole substitute for per - sonal experience , making up in largeness and depth what it lacks in peculiar application .

RICHARD WAGNER	PERSON	AND THE BAYRETJTH IDEA .

		* '' With the exception of two or three smaller works , every complete and thoroughly trust - worthy treatise on
Wagner	PERSON	from whatever standpoint it may have been written has been the work of a non-musician . ''

		This quotation from the important work which we are about to review is the statement of a fact striking in itself , and of the deepest significance as regards the position of
Richard Wagner	PERSON	in the history of cul - ture .

		Its interpretation must be that the art of the composer is so great , its bearings upon the spiritual life of mankind so varied , that it may not be measured or appraised by the technical standards of the musician .

		Exemplifying as it does an aesthetic , a philosophical theory , and a social ideal of its own , it demands for its compre - hension the widest knowledge and the highest analytical power .

		To estimate such a genius in the terms of musical art alone is as impos - sible as it would be to estimate Shakespeare in the terms of stage technology .

		In other words , the intellectual and emotional power of such men as
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and
Wagner	PERSON	so transcends the limitations of the arts in which they respec - tively wrought their creative work that the mere study of their technique is relegated to a sub - ordinate place , and the real problem presented by them is that of an interpretation which shall bring their work into relation with the deepest currents of human thought and feeling .

		Fur - thermore , if in the consideration of the phe - nomenon presented by the life of
Wagner	PERSON	the critic who is a musician and nothing more must stand aside , so also the German has hardly a stronger claim upon that great personality than has the Frenchman or the Englishman .

		`` Shakespeare is not our poet , but the world 's , '' says Landor ; and we may likewise say of Wag - ner that in his strenuous endeavor to create for
Germany	LOCATION	a strictly national art he builded bet - ter than he knew , and that the art which he fashioned grew to a thing of beauty world-wide in its power , and destined to do as much for the spiritual life of other nations as it accom - plished for his own .

		It is not surprising , then , that , in the first place , the most important books that have been written about
Wagner	PERSON	have not come from *

		THE DIAL 243 musicians , and , in the second place , that his fellow-countrymen are not the only ones who have worthily attempted to portray his life and work .

		Although it has been left for a German ,
Herr Glasenapp	PERSON	, to produce the most minute and laborious biography of the composer , it has been to a Frenchman ,
M. Jullien	PERSON	, that we have hitherto been indebted for the most attractive illustrated work upon
Wagner	PERSON	's art ; and it is now to an Englishman , Mr.
Houston Stewart Chamberlain	PERSON	, that our thanks are due for a publication even more sumptuous in execution , and far more sympathetic and penetrating as a work of interpretation and exposition .

		Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	has long been known as a Wag - nerian of the most painstaking accuracy , and some such work as the present has been ex - pected from him .

		His little treatise `` Das Drama
Richard Wagner	PERSON	's , '' published five years ago , promised the larger work which has now appeared , although it has not taken exactly the form then anticipated .

		What we have is a stout quarto of some four hundred pages , orig - inally written in German , and translated into English , under the author 's supervision , by Mr.
G. Ainslie Hight	PERSON	.

		Considered mechanically , the work , which bears the
London	LOCATION	imprint of the Messrs. Dent , is a beautiful example of book-making .

		The covers , the paper , the pro- portions , and the typography , are all in excel - lent taste , while the illustrations are simply superb .

		They include , in addition to some - thing like a hundred pictures imbedded in the text , nearly forty full-page plates .

		Some of these plates are facsimiles of manuscript , but most of them are either portraits or reproduc - tions of original paintings made for the work by
Herr Hendrich	ORGANIZATION	.

		There are five of these paintings , having for their subjects '' Der Flie - gende
Hollander	PERSON	, '' '' Siegfried und
Fafner	LOCATION	, '' ''
Briinnhilde	PERSON	's Rock , '' `` Siegfried 's Death , '' and the '' Funeral Procession with
Siegfried	PERSON	's Body . ''

		The artist , in Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	's words , 41 is one of the few painters whose imagination is not misled by the picture on the stage , who are able to grasp the central poetic idea , and to reproduce it freely in accordance with the character of their own art . ''

		These statements are certainly justified by the character of
Herr Hendrich	ORGANIZATION	's work as is evident enough from the monochrome reproductions here given and we must add that the designs display imag - ination of a very high sort , the ''
Briinnhilde	PERSON	's Rock , '' for example , which would be utterly impossible as a stage picture , being one of the most striking things we have ever seen .

		It needs for a text some such verses as may be found in Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's '' Ave atque Vale '' '' Her fair vast head , The deep division of prodigious breasts , The solemn slope of mighty limbs asleep , The weight of awful tresses that still keep The savour and shade of old-world pine-forests Where the wet hill-winds weep . ''

		As for the portraits in this volume , they in - clude no less than ten of
Wagner	PERSON	himself -LRB- among them three by
Lenbach	PERSON	and the Her - komer gouache -RRB- , and ten of other persons in some way associated with the composer .

		No - ticeable among them are
Waldmiiller	ORGANIZATION	's Beet - hoven and
Lenbach	ORGANIZATION	's
Schopenhauer	PERSON	, the latter one of the most extraordinary portraits ever painted .

		The reproductions of these works are in photogravure and collotype .

		We have now cleared the way for a dis - cussion of Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	's text .

		What he has aimed to do is set forth in the following passages , which stand well in the forefront of the volume . ''

		Here I have been led , from first to last , by the wish to view
Wagner	PERSON	from within , to represent him and the world as he saw them both .

		... I have been guided rather by a desire to bring the character and whole personality of the hero of my book ,
Richard Wagner	PERSON	, gradually nearer to -LSB- the reader -RSB- , than by any notion of assisting him to understand the dramas , which are much better able to speak for themselves . ''

		The plan of the book is simple and symmetrical .

		There is a '' Gen - eral Introduction , '' and then there are four main sections , or chapters , each provided with an appendix .

		These chapters are concerned , respectively , with the life of the composer , his writings , his music-dramas , and with '' the
Bayreuth	LOCATION	idea , '' which finally united the three threads of his career , `` the struggle , the thought , the art . ''

		We can not do better than follow Mr.
Cham	PERSON	- berlain in the arrangement of his material .

		His biographical chapter aims to present '' not as many , but as few facts as possible , '' and thus becomes little more than a skeleton life .

		The primary source of information is the body of
Wagner	ORGANIZATION	's own writings , which are made pecu - liarly available by his '' absolute and uncom - promising love of truth . ''

		The author lays much stress upon this fact . ''

		Nobody can doubt the extraordinary tenacity of
Wagner	PERSON	's memory ; no person competent to form an opinion would question his unswerving integ - rity . ''

		The secondary source of information is principally in the testimony of five men : Liszt , the loyal champion and friend ;
Stein	PERSON	, the 244 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, young poet and aesthetic philosopher , whose untimely death was a serious loss to German literature and thought ;
Herr Glasenapp	PERSON	, the industrious biographer ;
Herr von Wolzogen	PERSON	, the devoted commentator ; and
Herr Nietzsche	PERSON	, who must be judged by his classical ''
Richard Wagner	PERSON	in
Bayreuth	LOCATION	, '' which was `` written shortly before the first signs appeared of the fearful malady which shattered this splendid intellect , '' rather than by '' the silly pamphlets , full of nauseous trivialities , published later , '' in which evidence of the breaking-up of a great mind is all too evident .

		Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	out - lines
Wagner	PERSON	's life in about seventy-five pages of biography , noting particularly that the scrip - tural seventy years of its duration is broken into two almost exactly equal parts by the Revo - lution of
1849	DATE	, which made the composer an exile , and threw him upon the resources of his own spirit . ''

		Outlawed and persecuted , I was now bound by no ties to any sort of lie , ''
Wagner	PERSON	wrote of this event , which may justly be regarded as epochal for his career .

		The other event upon which stress is placed is that of
Wagner	PERSON	's becoming acquainted with the philosophy of
Schopenhauer	PERSON	in
1854	DATE	for nothing less than an event it was , the most important of his whole life , thinks Mr.
Cham	PERSON	- berlain . ''

		He has come to me in my solitude like a gift from Heaven , ''
Wagner	PERSON	wrote to Liszt , and no account of his intellectual de - velopment can ignore the deep influence ex - erted upon him by '' Die Welt als
Wille	PERSON	und Vorstellung . ''

		In accordance with the author 's purpose to present only the essential facts , this sketch of
Wagner	PERSON	's life omits altogether many matters that fill a large space in other biog - raphies , thus concentrating the attention upon what is really significant or decisive in his career .

		The chapter devoted to
Wagner	PERSON	's writings is about one hundred pages in length , discusses successively the three topics , politics , philoso - phy , and regeneration , and closes with a section on '' art teaching , '' which '' embraces equally all writings and all periods of
Wagner	PERSON	's life , for with
Wagner	PERSON	art is as the sun : from it all light is radiated ; round it every star revolves . ''

		The author rightly conceives that
Wagner	PERSON	's creative work needs for its comprehension a thorough study of his mental make-up as re - vealed by his voluminous prose writings , for , as
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	says : '' Die Kunst bleibt Kunst !

		Wer sie nicht durchgedaeht Der darf sich keinen Kiinstler nennen . ''


Wagner	PERSON	's political ideas were far removed from those which men of the world regard as `` prac - tical . ''

		It is true that he took an active part in the Revolution of
1849	DATE	, that he all but re - ceived the baptism of fire upon that occasion , and that his generous devotion entailed upon him many years of exile , with all their attend - ant hardships .

		But he soon reached a stage in which politics of the ordinary sort seemed to him `` quite fruitless , '' in which he aspired to - ward a far more fundamental reconstruction of society than was to be accomplished by any sub - stitution of one kind of machinery for another .

		Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	's ideas underwent a similar develop - ment at about the same age , and he wrote in 18701 : '' Our concepts call for new meanings and new explanations ... Men still call for special revolutions for revolutions in politics , in externals .

		But all that sort of thing is trum - pery .

		It is the human soul that must revolt .

		... The state is the curse of the individual .

		How has the strength of
Prussia	LOCATION	been bought ?

		By the sacrifice of the individual to the politi - cal and geographical idea .

		The
Kdlner	PERSON	is the best soldier .

		The state must away !

		That rev - olution shall find me on its side .

		Undermine the conception of the state ; proclaim free will and spiritual kinship as the leading elements in the final settlement , and we shall be on the way to a freedom that will be worth something . ''

		Taking the term `` state '' in its modern sense of constitutional monarchy , or of democracy sup - porting the divine right of majorities to do what they please , these words of the great Norwegian are the exact embodiment of at least a part of
Wagner	ORGANIZATION	's thought .

		But the latter still cher - ished the notion that the state , in the sense of a racial aggregation and an absolute monarchy , might prove compatible with the most insistent individualism .

		This paradoxical idea , which may also take the reverse form of '' free sover - eign absolute people , '' may be taken as the kernel of
Wagner	ORGANIZATION	's speculative thought in the political field .

		Recurring for a moment to the comparison with the Norwegian individualist , it is instructive to note the later divergence of their respective methods .

		Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	, after presenting to the world '' Brand '' and ''
Peer Gynt	PERSON	, '' those superb products of the positive ethical imagination , declined to the merely neg - ative task of putting his finger upon the sore places of modern society , and saying : thou ail - est here and here .

		Wagner , on the other hand , pursued to the end his passionate positive ideal of a society to be regenerated by self-sacrifice and sympathy and art , an ideal which united in its service the noblest aspirations of both
1897	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 245 the religious and the artistic consciousness .

		Still , it must be said of both these men that their political ideas were never really thought out , that when scrutinized with the lens of largest light-gathering capacity they remain in considerable part nebulous .


Wagner	PERSON	's philosophical development offers a curiously interesting study .

		`` It is the mark of the poet , '' he says , `` to be riper in the inner perception of things than in conscious abstract knowledge . ''

		Kant could not satisfy a nature thus constituted , and to it the Hegelian dialectic was the abomination of desolation .

		The phil - osophy of the latter '' succeeded in making the minds of the Germans so completely incapable of apprehending the problem of philosophy , that ever since it has been considered the only true philosophy to have no philosophy at all . ''

		It was in
Feuerbach	LOCATION	that
Wagner	PERSON	first found the help that he needed for the classification of his philosophical concepts , but that essentially shallow thinker provided only a temporary ref - uge for his restless mind .

		It was
Schopenhauer	PERSON	, as has already been stated , who removed the scales from his eyes , and provided him with a philosophy that satisfied the deep inner cravings of his nature .

		We should say that
Wagner	PERSON	did not assimilate or even understand the whole of
Schopenhauer	PERSON	's thought , and it is probable that the philosopher would have looked much askance at the later music-dramas if told that they were the outcome and embodiment of his theory of art , but his influence upon the com - poser remains nevertheless unquestionable .

		Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	admits that `` the personal equation may have to be applied , '' that '' between
Wagner	PERSON	and
Schopenhauer	PERSON	were incisive divergences , '' and then goes on to speak as follows : '' He who builds upon
Schopenhauer	PERSON	builds upon a rock ; that
Wagner	PERSON	clearly saw , and remained true to him from
1854	DATE	until his death .


Feuerbach	PERSON	was a passing episode , the last echo of the dumme Streiche of the revolution .

		The acquaintance with
Schopenhauer	PERSON	` the most genial of man - kind , ' as
Graf Leo Tolstoi	PERSON	calls him , is the most important event in
Wagner	ORGANIZATION	's whole life .

		Now for the first time his metaphysical yearning was provided with an efficient receptacle in this all-embracing view of the world ; now at last the marvellously ramified elements of his own being , as thinker and poet , were united again in his breast to a harmonious personality , con - scious in every detail the thinker meditated more deeply , the artist gained strength , the views of the politician became clearer , the Christian spirit , that of sympathy , of longing for redemption , of steadfastness till death , of resignation to the will of a higher Power , re - turned to the heart , from which many years be - fore had issued ` Tannhauser , ' ` Lohengrin , ' and ` Der
Hollander	PERSON	. '

		Over the
Meister	PERSON	's work-table there hung only the picture of the great seer , and in
1868	DATE	he wrote to
Lenbach	LOCATION	, the painter of the magnificent portrait : ' I have one hope for German culture , that the time will come when
Schopenhauer	PERSON	will be the law-giver for all our thought and cognition . ' ''

		Many others be - sides
Wagner	PERSON	have been similarly influenced by
Schopenhauer	PERSON	, even while rejecting much of his doctrine .

		The secret of that influence seems to be , in the words of Professor
Caldwell	PERSON	, the philosopher 's latest commentator , that he com - bined '' to a more wonderful extent than any other man who ever lived the power for abstract speculation with an enormous vitality of force and feeling , '' and that '' a clear and pure and direct intuition into life , a whole sense for reality , always weighed with
Schopenhauer	PERSON	far more than the greatest power of abstract thought . ''

		Much the most interesting part of Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	's chapter upon this subject is found in the pages which show , by quotations from the writings published before
Wagner	PERSON	had even heard the name of
Schopenhauer	PERSON	, how the mind of the artist was ripe for contact with the thought of the philosopher , how curiously the one had anticipated some of the most charac - teristic thoughts and expressions that he was afterwards to find in the pages of the other .


Wagner	PERSON	's departure from the teaching of the philosopher by whom he was so deeply in - fluenced is most distinctly marked in what may be called his doctrine of regeneration .

		It cer - tainly gives '' a surprising turn '' to the phil - osophy of
Schopenhauer	PERSON	to recommend it as the only one from which we may '' set out in - dependently on the paths of true hope . ''

		Yet
Wagner	PERSON	did nothing less than this , and in a very pregnant passage asserts that the Scho - penhauerian negation of the will to live , how - ever brought about , '' must always appear as the highest energy of the will itself . ''

		It is through the influence of art that regeneration must be sought ; and art then , which
Schopenhauer	PERSON	thought to offer but a temporary escape from the misery of existence , seemed to
Wagner	PERSON	to promise a way out of pessimism altogether .

		Now regeneration implies degeneration , and long before Dr.
Nordau	PERSON	's superficial and sen - sational discussion of degeneration it had been recognized by
Wagner	PERSON	in a far deeper sense .

		According to him this is the very beginning of 246 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, wisdom , for '' the will 's assurance of victory is achieved by the recognition of the decadence . ''

		The chief causes of this degeneration , which
Wagner	PERSON	believed to be the condition of all modern civilization , are to be found in the in - stitution of inherited property , the deteriora - tion of blood resulting from animal food , the weakening of racial stocks through intermar - riage with inferior peoples , and the moral in - fluence of Judaism .

		The statement of this latter cause may provoke a smile , but
Wagner	PERSON	took the subject very seriously , and it may be added that the spirit in which he considers it is as far removed from the spirit of the
Juden	PERSON	- Jietze as it is from the spirit of personal jeal - ousy by which small minds have sought to account for that extraordinary book , '' Das Judenthum in der Musik . ''

		As for the work of regeneration , it has three aspects , '' the empiric and historical , the abstract philosophi - cal , and the religious . ''

		But it is in art alone that these '' three worlds become conscious of their oneness , '' for art '' possesses the magic power of showing man to himself , and herewith pointing out the way to regeneration . ''

		This is a hard saying for those who regard art as an elevated form of amusement , or as the provider of delicate sensuous gratifications , but it must be grasped in its full meaning before anyone may hope to penetrate the inner significance of the work of
Richard Wagner	PERSON	.

		If we have devoted a disproportionate amount of attention to the ideas of the composer as distinguished from his art-works , it is because few , even among the most devoted students of his music , know very much about the philo - sophical theories upon which that music is based , or of the social ideals to which dramatic embodiment is given : it must be remembered that
Wagner	PERSON	was a man of scholarship and culture as few , if any , of his predecessors had been , and that with him the creative instinct was under the most complete control of the in - telligence .

		Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	's discussion of the art-works , therefore , while of great value , demands less of our attention than what he has to say about their underlying system of thought .

		A few remarks should be made , however , on the subject of
Wagner	ORGANIZATION	's poetic powers .

		Most Wagnerian enthusiasts -LRB- and the author offers no exception -RRB- try to claim for the Master the title of poet to a degree unwarranted by the facts and unnecessary for his fame .

		It is mere juggling with words to call
Wagner	PERSON	a great poet simply because he created certain great dramatic figures '' which belong henceforward and for all time as completely and inalienably to the living consciousness of the entire human race as an Achilleus , an QEdipus , a Hamlet , or a Faust . ''

		We may admit all this and we firmly believe it to be true without thinking it necessary to call the creator of these figures a great poet .

		The simple truth is that
Wagner	PERSON	was enough of a poet for the purposes of the complex art for which he stands .

		It is not the greatness of his texts , considered as literature , that compels our admiration , but their absolute adequacy .

		Poetry that is great on its own account would be out of place in such works as '' Siegfried '' and '' Parsifal '' because it would demand too large a share of the attention .

		It is absolutely necessary that the poetry em - ployed for such a purpose should be reduced to its lowest terms , so to speak , a fact which
Wagner	PERSON	's own artistic instincts led him to real - ize , but which few of his followers have been willing to admit .

		What
Wagner	PERSON	accomplished was to fulfil the prophecy of
Herder	ORGANIZATION	, who looked for the advent of the man who should '' upset the whole abode of scrappy operatic sing-song , and erect an Odeum , a complete lyric building , in which poetry , music , action , and scenery are one . ''

		The Odeum of this prophecy was erected in
1876	DATE	, set upon a hill , and for more than twenty years now have pilgrims from all parts of the world sought it out .

		What they have found there is more than words have yet availed to say .

		There are thousands of persons now living for whom the tone-poems of
Wagner	PERSON	have been an influence profoundly shaping both thought and character , and a century from now they will be numbered by hundreds of thousands .

		Yet these very persons , although they know what the influence has been , find it utterly in - explicable in terms of the intellect .

		They can tell just how and why they have been influenced by
Plato	ORGANIZATION	, or
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, or Goethe , but they can not thus explain the power of
Bach	LOCATION	, or
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	, or
Wagner	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	comes as near as anyone else to offering such an explanation , but after all his reasoning , we are left with a feeling that the secret is still uncommunicated and is probably incommuni - cable .

		Perhaps we may hope to do nothing more than take for our final stand the position of
Schopenhauer	PERSON	, who held that , whereas the other arts represent to the intelligence the various ideal objectifications of the world-will , the art of music is the immediate expression of the will itself , and as such incapable of in - terpretation because in need of none .

		The
1897	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 247 more deeply we consider the subject , the more are we forced to the opinion that all explana - tions of the appeal of music to the conscious - ness are but rhetorical devices to veil the real problem in a network of figurative speech and more or less fanciful analogy .

		THE VICTORIAN DRAMA .

		* A French writer ,
M. Augustin Filon	PERSON	, has given us a very readable account of the
Victo	PERSON	- rian drama , with the avowed object of proving that there exists at this time a living English drama , that is to say , a drama expressing '' the ideas and passions of the time '' and re - producing '' a complete synthesis of all the elements of the national character . ''

		Such a drama , the author thinks , did not exist thirty years ago .

		Then there were various forces at work which prevented it from being developed along original lines .

		Among these forces were '' the timidity resulting from excessive severity of manners , '' '' the dramatist 's lack of oppor - tunity for the study of social life , '' and '' the Shakespeare cult , which paralyzed the imagina - tion by offering it a model that was too big for it , and forms that had become antiquated . ''

		One after another these forces have been dis - sipated ; and along with them has gone much of the English playwrights ' dependence on French dramatists of the Sardou stamp , a dependence which M. Filon confesses was alto - gether harmful to the English stage .

		Now that these clouds have blown over , he is of the opinion that to-morrow will be even brighter than to - day , and in a concluding paragraph he goes so far as to suggest the probable trend of the present movement . ''

		What the English drama is in search of , what it is about to create , ... is a new form in which to repro - duce that dualism which has struck and disconcerted every observer , native or foreign ,
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	,
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Taine	PERSON	.

		... A race of heroes who are also buccaneers , a race of poets and shopkeepers , a race fear - less of death and devoted to money , calculating but passionate , dreamers yet men of action , capable of the charges of
Balaklava	LOCATION	and the deal in the
Suez	ORGANIZATION	shares , can not possibly find its literary expression either in pure idealism or in realism undiluted .

		The ` bleeding slice of life ' awakes in it no appetite ; ' Art for art 's sake ' leaves it wonderfully indifferent ; of moralising , it is tired for the time being : it is passing through a stage of sensuous torpor which is not without charm , and it * THE ENGLISH STAGE : Being an Account of the Victorian Drama .

		waits , open-eyed and , as it were , hesitatingly , before the labour of creating society afresh , of building up a new civilization .

		It does not wish , and is not able , to forget those problems that terrible To-morrow by which we are everywhere threatened .

		Hence its sensuousness is tempered , refined , saddened by philosophy .

		And in this mood , what it asks of the drama is , not to be amused , or to be excited , but to be made to think . ''

		It may be that not all , or even a majority , of
M. Filon	ORGANIZATION	's readers will adopt this thesis , or accept the extremely hopeful view he takes of the present dramatic movement in
England	LOCATION	; but none will deny that he has written an en - tertaining and instructive account of a literary type and period which have heretofore wanted an impartial historian .

		In his treatment of this period ,
M. Filon	PERSON	has attempted to trace the origin of the Victorian drama ; he has dis - cussed the influences from within and from without which have helped to mould and shape its course ; and he has analyzed its most rep - resentative plays .

		He has also considered such salient features of acting and dramatic criticism as seemed most noteworthy .

		He has thus worked out a threefold treatment of a period which extends , roughly speaking , all the way from
Sheridan Knowles	PERSON	to
Grundy	LOCATION	,
Jones	PERSON	, and
Pinero	PERSON	; from
Edmund Kean	PERSON	to Sir
Henry Irving	PERSON	; and from
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	to
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	and
William Archer	PERSON	.

		In this moving throng of dramatists , actors , and dramatic critics , precedence is always given to the dra matist ; and by this means the author has been able to secure variety by scattering through his pages anecdotes about players , scraps from published and unpublished plays , little pastels of dramatists living and dead , stray bits of reminiscence , and so on , without materially marring , in either conception or treatment , the essential unity of his work .

		One does not have to go far in this book to find pictures which recall vividly old-life scenes .

		One of the best of these is that of the strolling player whose custom it was to go on circuit through the country towns of
England	LOCATION	. ''

		Just as the English judges make the round at cer - tain dates of all the important towns within a certain district , holding assizes at each , and accompanied by an army of barristers , solicitors , and legal officials of all kinds , so the travelling companies of actors would cater for a whole county , or group of counties , giving a series of performances in the theatre of every town at certain fixed dates , in addition to fete-days and market-days .

		Communication was slow and costly in those days , and trips to
London	LOCATION	infinitely rarer than they are now .

		The country folk had to look to their travelling company to keep them in touch with the success of the moment . ''

		On arriving in a new town , the manager 's wife would go about soliciting respectfully the patronage of the ladies of the place .

		The manager busied himself 248 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, over everything , played minor roles , presided over the box-office , undertook the scene painting , and would even take off his coat and turn up his sleeves and lend a hand to the machinist .

		His life , and the life of all his com - pany , was half bourgois , half Bohemian ; always en route , but always on the same beat , always coming upon familiar and friendly faces , a beat on which his father and grandfather before him had followed the same career .

		He had friends living in every city , dead friends in every churchyard .

		Children were born to him on his travels , and when four or five years old made their appearance upon the stage .

		These comings and goings , the journeyings over green fields , the stoppages and ample breakfastings at little hillside inns , while the horses browsed at large along the hedges , the fresh - ness and peaceful rusticity of all these things , alternating with the tinsel of the theatre and the applause of the audiences , with the artificiality and feverishness of theatrical life , must have been a constant entertain - ment to the little actors and actresses of eight or nine .

		For the adults , however , the life was a hard one , and only too often their roman comique was a roman tragique in reality . ''

		Here is an account of a pilgrimage which
M. Filon	PERSON	made to a deserted theatre : '' I took it into my head not long ago to pay a visit to the little theatre in which Fre ` de ` ric
Lemaitre	PERSON	ap - peared , in which
Napoleon	PERSON	and Count d'Orsay rubbed shoulders with
Dickens	PERSON	and
Thackeray	PERSON	, in which there was difficulty once in finding a seat for
Gladstone	ORGANIZATION	, and in which
Beaconsfield	ORGANIZATION	received a memorable ovation .

		The Salvationists have succeeded to the comedians , and , whether or not it be that their trumpets have the virtue of those of
Jericho	LOCATION	, these historic walls are crumbling to ruin .

		The place is empty , cold , and desolate .

		It was on an evening of
last winter	DATE	that I stood pensively under the porch the porch through which had flowed like a stream all the elegance and talent of a whole generation .

		The light of a gas jet shone mournfully on the notice , mouldy already , To be let or sold ' ; and the rain trickled down on me from a gaping hole whence the electric light used once to glare upon pretty women issuing in all their finery from their carriages . ''

		As almost two-thirds of
M. Filon	PERSON	's book is concerned with the generation still living , and as contemporary criticism must ever be more or less modified by time , many of the individual judgments expressed here will not be those of twenty-five , or even ten , years hence .

		Nearness to the period criticised has in some cases de - prived the author of that independence of judg - ment so essential to enduring criticism .

		An example of this is his attempt to compromise between the two schools of dramatic criticism now at odds in
England	LOCATION	, an attempt that reminds us more than anything else of the endeavors of
George Eliot	PERSON	's conciliatory land - lord in ''
Silas Marner	PERSON	, '' or of the worthy old umbrella-maker in the double chin whom Irving humorously describes in '' Little
Britain	LOCATION	. ''

		Much of
M. Filon	ORGANIZATION	's criticism , however , has lasting merit ; of this sort is nearly all that he has to say of
Bulwer Lytton	ORGANIZATION	,
Irving	LOCATION	,
Tennyson	PERSON	, and
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's influence on the English drama .

		That easy , familiar style , so characteristic of French men of letters , has not been lost in the translation .

		And , in concluding , it may be added that Mr.
Henry Arthur Jones	PERSON	, under the guise of introducing
M. Filon	PERSON	to his English readers , has some good , and many bad , things to say about a dramatic movement in which his own works have exerted no inconsiderable in - fluence .

		MR. AUBREY DE VERB 'S RECOLLECTIONS .

		* In his preface to his '' Recollections '' Mr.
De Vere	PERSON	makes a distinction between ''
Recollec	PERSON	- tions '' and '' Autobiographies . '' ''

		This book , '' he says , '' belongs to the former class , not to the latter .

		We have seen persons and places which have amused or interested us , and it occurs to us that if accurately described they might amuse or interest others also ; but this is a very different thing from writing one 's biography , with which the world has little con - cern . ''

		The book before us is itself a refuta - tion of this modest theory ; with its notable men and their own interpretations of their lives the world has a large and serious concern , and a memory whose limits are practically those of the Victorian Era can do us no better service than to render up its important and accumu - lated treasures .

		We remember the distaste which
Hawthorne	PERSON	and
Tennyson	PERSON	had for biographies , and the appalling disclosures which so many writers of them have deemed a necessary part of the task which had been set for them ; but now that the
Tennyson	PERSON	memoirs have been written , and we have learned from them once more how a bio - graphical work should be done , we may con - sider ourselves recovered from the dismay with which some exemplars filled us .

		Mr.
De Vere	PERSON	's Recollections date back to the
earlier years of the century	DATE	.

		In an Irish home of wealth and refinement he enjoyed those op - portunities which a mind like his needs for the due unfolding of its powers .

		He has , however , some curious anecdotes to relate of a grand - father who was a typical man of the place and period .

		He was early brought into relation with the varied life of the time , and his inter - ests always have been far-reaching and many - sided .

		Religion and politics have occupied his attention as well as literature , and the struggle * RECOLLECTIONS OF AUBREY DE VERB .

		THE DIAL 249 of his country for genuine subsistence and recognition has been , as was right , a master influence in his career .

		Authors are very apt to narrow their inter - ests to the subjects with which they are specially occupied .

		The maker of verses is very prone to believe that the production of a new lyric is the end toward which the forces of the century have been toiling .

		Literature is no doubt a great field which requires assiduous tillage , but there are others in which the laborers reap abundant harvests and manifold honors .

		Mr.
De Vere	PERSON	's intimacies with the important men in diverse regions of intellectual activity give to his book a value which no merely literary preoccupation could possess .

		The figures that cross these pages are as differenced as the labors of the period ,
Wordsworth	PERSON	, Sir
William R. Hamilton	PERSON	the mathematician ,
O'Connell	PERSON	, Car - dinals
Newman	PERSON	and
Manning	PERSON	.

		Some anec - dotes of Sir
William Rowan Hamilton	PERSON	may be repeated here . ''

		Sir
W. R. Hamilton	PERSON	kept a headstrong horse , to which he had given the name of ' Comet , ' and used to gallop it in circles , or perhaps in ellipses , around the lawn .

		On one occasion he mounted him in
Dublin	LOCATION	, just after a curious mathematical problem had suggested itself to him .

		The horse took a mean advantage of his abstraction , and ran away .

		When I found it impossible to stop him , ' he said , I gave him his head and returned to the problem .

		He ran for four miles , and stood still at my gate just as the problem was solved . ' '' ''

		The Royal Astronomer -LSB-
Hamilton	PERSON	-RSB- did not look through his telescope more than once or twice a year !

		He used to say , ' That is my deputy 's business .

		The stars move all night ; but what interests me is the high mathesis that accounts for their movements . ' ''

		The observation sounds strange in this day of the accumulation of data and so-called facts .

		Mr.
Aubrey De Vere	PERSON	began to write poetry when he was about eighteen years old , although without thought of publication .

		It was to his father that he owed his introduction to Words - worth , the influence that was to dominate so much of his thought and aspiration . ''

		I had happened to say to my father , I suppose everyone knows that
Byron	PERSON	is the greatest modern poet . '

		He answered , very quietly , ' I do not know it . '

		Then who is ? '

		He replied , I should say
Wordsworth	PERSON	. ' '

		And , pray , what are his chief merits ? '

		He answered , ' I should say , majesty and pathos , as for instance in '' Laodamia . '' '

		I read '
Laodamia	PERSON	' standing , to the last line , and was converted .

		I seemed to have got upon a new and larger planet , with ' An ampler ether , a diviner air , And fields invested with purpureal gleams . ' ''

		In
1841	DATE	our author passed several days under
Wordsworth	PERSON	's roof , which he considers the greatest honor of his life .

		The old poet took him out walking . ''

		He showed me the scenes to which he was most attached , and recorded many incidents connected with them .

		In the presence of Nature he seemed to be always either conversing with her as a friend , and watch - ing her changeful moods , or sometimes rapt , like a prophet , in mystic attention to her oracles .

		It was by no means the picturesque aspects of Nature which affected him most it was something far more serious and absorbing .

		For him it was in her deeper meanings that the inspiring influences of Nature chiefly resided .

		If one had demanded of him what were those deeper meanings , it would have been as if one had demanded of Beethoven what were the deeper meanings of his grandest sym - phonies , which are often his obscurest . ''

		In 1843-4 he travelled in
Italy	LOCATION	with Sir
Henry Taylor	PERSON	.

		The friendship with the author of ''
Philip Van Artevelde	PERSON	'' extended over a period of forty years .

		The tribute which he pays to Sir
Henry Taylor	PERSON	is extreme .

		It may perhaps be said of the Wordsworthians that they have dwelt too close to the splendor of their chief .

		The poetry of Sir
Henry Taylor	PERSON	, and of Mr. De Vere himself , would have had better chances of the recognition which was undeniably their due if they had moved out of the charmed circle in which they seemed con - tent to remain .

		There could be but one Words - worth , and emancipation from him was a simple necessity .

		While travelling to
England	LOCATION	in the
spring of 1841	DATE	, Mr.
De Vere met O'Connell	PERSON	.

		They went together from
Liverpool	LOCATION	to
London	LOCATION	.

		The potent eye , the large and crafty mouth , the broad strong forehead , the confident bearing of the '' Liberator , '' made their due impression .

		As was intimated before , what may be called the political recollections of the author make a fair share of his volume , and the chapters devoted to them have a value proportioned to the impor - tance of their subjects .

		There is a long account of the great Irish Famine -LRB- 1846-50 -RRB- , with the various forms of attempted amelioration .

		It is a dark interlude in a book which is full of sun - shine , simple humor , generous hopefulness of all kinds .

		An account of the '' Recollections '' which omitted the reminiscences of Cardinal New - man and Cardinal
Manning	PERSON	would indeed be incomplete .

		Those portions would no doubt be regarded of prime value by the author , and in them there is a subdued enthusiasm which does not so fully appear elsewhere .


Newman	PERSON	and
Wordsworth	PERSON	are the two men for whom Mr.
De Vere	PERSON	has the deepest admiration , and he has in himself an abundance of the material from which hero-worshippers are made .

		His admirations , however , are invariably reasoned ones ; they are not expressed without the 250 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov.	DATE	l r grounds on which they are based .

		Indeed , the chapters dealing with
Newman	PERSON	and
Manning	PERSON	are rather portraits than recollections , and have the vividness which comes from personal friend - ship .

		It will interest the reader to learn that the '' Dream of Gerontius '' on the information of Newman '' owed its preservation to an acci - dent .


Newman	PERSON	had written it on a sudden impulse , put it aside , and forgotten it .

		The editor of a magazine wrote to him asking for a contribution .

		He looked into all his pigeon - holes , and found nothing theological ; but , in answering his correspondent , he added that he had come upon some verses , which , if as editor he cared to have , were at his command .

		The wise editor did care , and they were published at once .

		I well remember the delight with which many of them were read aloud by the Bishop of
Gibraltar	LOCATION	, Dr.
Charles Harris	PERSON	, who was then on a visit with us , and the ardor with which we all shared his enjoyment . ''

		So these memories take their course , the records of a life devoted to noble purposes and accomplishing high results .

		We are admitted into intimacy with those who played great parts in the drama of Victorian life ; we see them in their habit as they moved , and learn much of their thought from a listener who was generous and sympathetic ; and above all we carry away with us a picture of the poet and thinker and toiler for whom we can only have much of that admiration which he so freely lavishes on others .

		The publisher of the work has done his part of the task well ; the volume is a pleasure to the eye , as its contents are to the mind and heart of the reader .

		this was accomplished during the year
1867	DATE	.

		A new national spirit had been growing up in
Germany	LOCATION	as in the other parts of
Europe	LOCATION	dur - ing the middle part of the century , had reached the stage of enthusiasm in
1848	DATE	, and after the inevitable reaction following that excitement had become solidified into a practical working principle .


Prussia	LOCATION	's victory gave it its oppor - tunity , and now a real state was to be created to replace the shadowy affair that had repre - sented German particularism .

		This same year was also a preparation for the struggle that was inevitable before a jealous
France	LOCATION	could be in - duced to accept the changes in the map of
Europe	LOCATION	and the fancied humiliation of being shoved aside from her position as the self - constituted arbiter of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		This volume describes the irritation in
France	LOCATION	at
Prussia	LOCATION	' * successes , and the efforts , constantly becoming more frantic , to win from
Prussia	LOCATION	some com - pensation for the latter 's increase of power that would salve the wounded vanity of Frenchmen and restore the declining prestige of the Empire ; and how each of these efforts was thwarted by an outburst of national feeling in
Germany	LOCATION	and by the shrewdness of
Bismarck	ORGANIZATION	's management .

		But Professor von Sybel shows that
Bismarck	PERSON	did not thwart poor
Napoleon	PERSON	's schemes with malignant satisfaction , as many writers have declared , but that he was ready to make con - cessions that might have prevented the war of
1870	DATE	, had he not been held in check by the military party or by these patriotic outburst * that he did not dare to disregard .

		The outcome of this international game is left for a later volume .

		These things , however , are almost incidental to the main matter of the volume , which is taken up with a description of the political struggles incident to the formation of the new constitution , and to the establishment of definite relations with the South German states .

		The reader is forcibly reminded of the struggles of our own Critical Period and the Constitutional Convention of
1787	DATE	.

		There was the same nar - row particularism , the same jealousy of state against state , the same unpractical idealism .

		But in the German Reichstag the national spirit was reinforced by the overwhelming in - fluence of
Prussia	LOCATION	and her great statesman , by the powerful Customs-Union upon which the material prosperity of the smaller states de - pended , and by the pressure of outside nations .

		On the other hand , German idealism tended naturally to increase the difficulty of reaching a satisfactory result as against the practical

		THE DIAL 251 Anglo-Saxon tendencies of our Fathers .

		With due pressure judiciously applied by
Bismarck	PERSON	at critical times , a good working constitution was framed and promptly ratified .

		The matter of the relations of the South German States to the new German nation was difficult to handle , but was handled with con - summate shrewdness .

		Their accession to the Confederation in time was inevitable , for they could not stand alone , they could not go back to
Austria	LOCATION	, and they could not be dependent upon
France	LOCATION	, the German national spirit would work out the union in due time .

		But
Bismarck	PERSON	recognized that to hurry the process would be to retard it , and so , to the astonish - ment of the surrounding nations , who could hardly understand such self-restraint , he dis - couraged all premature attempts to bring them in .

		Their relations to the Confederation were fixed on a comfortable working basis , they entered the reorganized Customs-Union , they bound themselves to the Confederation by close alliances , and then were left to themselves .

		Later events showed how thoroughly German they were at heart , and how readily they would join their northern brothers when a common patriotic endeavor should break down the tra - ditional barriers between them .

		The author states in his preface that after Prince
Bismarck	PERSON	's retirement he was refused access to the documents of the
Foreign Office	ORGANIZATION	, and for a time gave up his project .

		But being pushed by his publisher to continue the work and fulfil his contract , he found that the litera - ture already in print , written records made at the time , diaries , journals , and correspondence , and his own recollections as a leading actor in the parliamentary life that he describes , would in a measure supply the place of official docu - ments . ''

		The documents denied me would probably have afforded a greater knowledge of detail , but in so far as a correct conception of the essential course of events is concerned , their place was fully supplied . ''


CHARLES H. COOPER	PERSON	.

		WITH the death of
Newton Bateman	PERSON	, of
Galesburg	LOCATION	, an interesting figure disappears from educational
Illinois	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
Bateman	PERSON	was for fourteen years superintendent of the public schools of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, and for nearly twenty years following was President of
Knox College	ORGANIZATION	.

		He belonged to the generation of
Mann	PERSON	and
Barnard	PERSON	, and his influence as a public educator was at least compar - able with theirs .

		Of late he has been engaged in editing , together with Mr.
Paul Selby	PERSON	, a '' Historical
Encyclo	PERSON	- pedia of
Illinois	LOCATION	, '' and the work is practically ready for publication .

		Dr.
Bateman	PERSON	died
October 21	DATE	, at the age of seventy-five .

		STUDIES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT .

		* The interest shown by
New Testament	ORGANIZATION	scholars in the life of Jesus is repeatedly evidenced in pub - lishers ' lists .

		Here , quite as much as in any biblical works , the historical spirit is capable of producing studies in which doctrine is treated so objectively as to lose much of the metaphysical character from which it has so long suffered .

		In his '' Student 's Life of Jesus , '' Professor
Gil	PERSON	- bert has given teachers an excellent help for the conduct of both seminary and college classes .

		It is written in simple style , and with considerable criti - cal liberality .

		Now biographers who deal with the Gospels in anything like a conservative spirit are altogether too prone to regard as separate episodes any accounts which are not strikingly similar , ob - livious of the fact that the same event may appear in very different guise in different families of sources .

		In the case of the three gospels , it is alto - gether probable that this is true of several accounts in which details are variant .

		Professor
Gilbert	PERSON	has recognized this to a considerable extent , and has not fallen into the common fault of over-identifica - tion .

		Another excellence of the book is its Intro - duction , in which , despite the author 's rejection of what seems to most authorities the most probable explanation of the origin of the
Synoptics	ORGANIZATION	, he has given sufficient data to enable the student to get a very fair general conception of the synoptic prob - lems .

		And this is no small service .

		One may per - haps not always agree with some of the author 's conclusions , and at times it is disappointing to find hesitancy in the treatment of questions ; but , after all , the book is admirably adapted for use by those persons who really want to begin the study of the life of Jesus according to modern methods .

		Very similar is the work of Professor
Bruce	PERSON	.

		Though a sort of by-product of the study , it is written with soberness , and its conclusions , if not novel , are at least so simply stated as to give it a certain inde - pendent value .

		Here we find the critical spirit pro- * THE STUDENT ' s LIFE OF JESUS .

		252 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, ducing something more than conjecture and destruc - tion .

		Professor
Bruce	PERSON	, in popularizing the positive conclusions of a life of scholarship , has rendered no small service to the great number of intelligent men who do not care for processes , hut wish to study the character and teachings of Jesus in the same spirit as that with which they approach other men .

		As an elementary study of the chief peculiarities of each of the three synoptists it will be found of great aid by those who care more for rapid description than for the minutiae of criticism .

		Perhaps the most striking certainly the most novel portion of the work is the addition of a catechism by the use of which it is hoped that young minds may be early indoctri - nated with the proper conceptions of Jesus .

		It is to be feared that few except
Scotchmen	PERSON	will feel deeply the need of such an instrument , but none the less is it suggestive and valuable as a sort of epitome of Professor
Bruce	PERSON	's own position .

		There has been a great lack of good commentaries upon the
Third Gospel	ORGANIZATION	, and for this reason , if for no other , the new volume by Professor
Plummer	PERSON	is welcome .

		As a book to be used , it has the excellence of the other volumes of the '' International Critical Commentary Series '' admirable paragraphing , suggestive variation in style , clear analyses .

		It is evidently the fruit of great reading and study .

		The Introduction contains an exhaustive treatment of the literary peculiarities of
Luke	PERSON	, as well as an admir - able discussion of his point of view .

		Professor
Plummer	PERSON	rejects the allegation that
Luke	PERSON	wrote under Ebinistic influences , and has admirably summed up the whole susceptibility of Luke to social problems in declaring that he is opposed to worldli - ness but not to wealth .

		As to the sources whence
Luke	PERSON	drew his materials , the author seems to hold , though with some hesitation , the current view of two main and several supplementary groups of material .

		He does not , however , very often make use of such a critical position as a means of solving some of the questions suggested by a comparison of
Luke and Matthew	PERSON	, but seems to prefer to regard Jesus as having repeated many of his sayings a position that becomes somewhat difficult when applied to the relations of the '' Sermon on the Plain '' and the '' Sermon on the Mount . ''

		Indeed , one can not escape a feeling of disappointment in seeing how little bearing the whole critical position of the Introduction has upon the main portion of the Commentary .

		English -LRB- not Scotch -RRB- scholar ship seems far more conservative one is tempted to say cautious than American in grappling with the critical ques - tions of the
New Testament	ORGANIZATION	.

		The exegesis -LRB- despite the absence of word-studies and the preference of a known
Cremer	PERSON	and Trench to an unknown
Vincent	PERSON	and
Thayer	PERSON	-RRB- is sober and scholarly .

		It is most satis - factory to see Jesus freed of the amiable prodigality in charity given him by the Authorized Version through the mistranslation of the Greek .

		Altogether , the work bears out the promise given by the volume of
Sanday	PERSON	and
Headlam	PERSON	on Romans , and is easily the best com - mentary on Luke produced in English .

		The latest addition to the same series is much smaller in compass , and deals with matters of much less difficulty .

		Yet among the numerous commen - taries in
Phillippians	LOCATION	, this of Professor
Vincent	PERSON	is bound to be ranked more highly than his Preface modestly hopes .

		The work is characterized by the same thoroughness that one has learned to expect from its author , and although we shall be slow to forget the work of
Lightfoot	ORGANIZATION	, it will be difficult to find as equally compact and complete an Introduc - tion as that furnished in the present volume .

		Very sensibly Professor
Vincent	PERSON	has not attempted to pad his volume up to a regulation number of pages , but has been content to explain that alone that needed explanation .

		Yet on the great doctrinal passage , 2:6 -10 , he has given a most exhaustive study of the words employed .

		Other special studies , though naturally not as numerous as those in some of the other volumes of the series , are equally good .

		It is also gratifying to see that in the discussion of these strongly rhetorical passages , Professor
Vincent	PERSON	holds fast to his conception of the informal , untheological character of the letter as a whole .

		His discussion of
Philemon	LOCATION	is marked by sympathy and apprecia - tion , and his full discussion of the relations of
Paul	PERSON	- ine Christianity to slavery are interesting , both his - torically and sociologically .

		It is perhaps not altogether without significance that the most notable contributions during the past few months to New Testament study have been made in connection with the two series in each of which Professor
Briggs	PERSON	is co-editor , for such results point to the increasing fruitf ulness of the critical method of which he has become one of the chief representatives .

		Of them all we are tempted to regard the work of Professor
McGiffert	PERSON	as on the whole worthy of the most consideration , both for the sweep of its treatment and use of historical criticism .

		Persons familiar only with the older English and American literature on the Apostolic Age will be especially impressed with this radical departure in method , and will perhaps also be dis - appointed to find that the neutral attitude of the historian has so largely replaced religious sympathy and fervor .

		But at the same time they will be com - pelled to admit the book 's worth .

		Professor Mc -
Giffert	ORGANIZATION	's positions on the chief questions at present undergoing investigation are in most instances revo - lutionary , not only of a received chronology of the Apostolic Age , but also in one instance at least -LRB- the date of the Epistle to the Galatians -RRB- of the current order of the events in
Paul	LOCATION	's life .

		To discuss these questions is here impossible , but one can not alto - gether agree with -LRB- 1 -RRB- the identification of
Paul	PERSON	's visits to
Jerusalem	LOCATION	, mentioned Acts 11 , 15 , and Galatians 2:1 -10 ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- with the date of Galatians ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- with the date of the accession of
Felix	LOCATION	, although in the latter case the author 's position or one approximating it can claim the support of such names as
Harnack	LOCATION	and
Oskar Holtzmann	PERSON	.

		Professor
McGiffert	PERSON	's discussion of the Pastoral Epistles which , as they stand , he regards as not written by
1897	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 253
Paul	PERSON	, though based upon and comprising genuine letters of the Apostle is especially strong .

		The other epistles of
Paul	PERSON	, in common with the present semi-conservative tendency of criticism he regards as genuine .

		1
Peter	PERSON	he ingeniously suggests was written by
Barnabas	PERSON	, 2
Peter	PERSON	being the single pseu - donymous letter of the canon .

		In his criticism of Acts , Professor
McGiffert	PERSON	, although giving no com - prehensive statement as to his position , is yet con - sistent , although at times his omission to set forth fully his critical position makes his decisions appear arbitrary .

		But taking the volume as a whole , we are impressed with its importance as a contribution to the literature of its subject , and may well con - gratulate American scholarship that it has produced a work conceived in the modern spirit , which , though perhaps less original than that work , can not unfairly be classed with that of
Weizsacker	PERSON	.


SHAILER MATHEWS	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS . ''

		The Comprehensive Subject-Index to
Universal Prose Fiction	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mrs.
Zella Allen Dixson	PERSON	-LRB-
Dodd	PERSON	-RRB- , is a bibliographical work for the guidance of novel - readers who wish to derive something more than amusement from works of fiction . ''

		Only novels with a purpose , those which are sent out into the world with a definite lesson to teach mankind , '' are included in this list .

		The idea is an excellent one , and has before been embodied in the annotated catalogues of some of our larger public libraries , as well as in the special lists published from time to time by Mr.
W. M. Griswold	PERSON	.

		The present volume is the most ambitious attempt that has yet been made in this direction , and gives the titles of many thousands of books , including novels in the chief continental languages .

		It would , perhaps , be a little unfair to criticise such a compilation for its omis - sions , which are many , or even for the fact that it includes a vast amount of rubbishy literature whose '' definite lesson to teach mankind '' is at least questionable .

		But the positive inaccuracies of the work are so glaring that they can not be allowed to pass unnoticed .

		On the very first page the subject of Abbeys appears , and the classification runs after this fashion : MELBOSE .

		Monastery .

		Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	.

		NIGHTMARE .

		Nightmare Abbey .

		Thomas Love
Peacock	PERSON	.

		NORTHANGER .

		Northanger Abbey .


Jane Austen	PERSON	.

		It makes a queer sort of catalogue , but stranger things are to follow .

		When we find
Boyesen	ORGANIZATION	's ''
Gunnar	PERSON	'' under the head of '' Vikings , '' and
Franzos	PERSON	's `` Ein Kampf urn 's Recht '' under '' Galicia ,
Spain	LOCATION	, '' we rub our eyes , but the climax is reached when we find Mr.
Kenneth Grahame	PERSON	's '' Golden Age '' catalogued under '' Lives of Christ . ''

		A book is frequently entered under several heads , as is proper , but it was hardly necessary , for the sake of Mr.
Hall Caine	PERSON	, to provide lists under both '' Isle of Man '' and '' Manx Life . ''

		And lest no searcher for instruction in the guise of fiction should miss
M. Zola	PERSON	's '' Lourdes , '' we find that work classi - fied under '' Christian Science , '' '' Ghost Stories , '' and '' Medical Novels . ''

		As for the minor inaccu - racies , they are legion .

		It took us only about five minutes to spot the following : '' Civil War ,
England	LOCATION	,
1625	DATE	'' ; '' Meimhold , '' for the author of '' Die
Bern	LOCATION	- steinhexe '' ; '' Naulahke , '' for Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's novel ; '' Valentius , '' f or Mr.
Astor	PERSON	's `` Valentino '' ; `` Tollo , '' for '' Tolla '' ; J < Su Thoroddsen , '' for
Jon	PERSON	of that ilk ; and ''
Olaf Trygg Veson	PERSON	, '' for the famous
Norse King	ORGANIZATION	.

		A few years ago , when
Browning	PERSON	rownin f g Society .

		Societies were something new under the sun , they were characterized as '' fads , '' and described as '' adult parsing societies for the working out of literary conundrums , puz - zles , and rebuses . ''

		How far these statements fail of the truth , in some cases , is shown by the con - tinued existence of the
Boston Browning Society	ORGANIZATION	after twelve years , and by the publication of twenty - four of its papers as representative of its work dur - ing that time .

		The fact is that there are here no evidences of the verbal interpretation and gram - matical quibbling sometimes supposed to make up the proceedings of a
Browning Club	ORGANIZATION	.

		On the con - trary , the papers deal with such themes as
Brown	PERSON	- ing 's thought , art , and philosophy , in a manner at once so sympathetic and so judicial that all lovers of good literary criticism , whether
Browning	PERSON	students or not , must delight in them .

		Long ago somebody dubbed
Browning	PERSON	'' the poet of the opaques , '' and in the popular mind this has served to account for the clubs devoted to the study of his writings .

		But the popular mind mistakes .

		Browning societies were started , as Shakespeare societies are started , in order to read and re-read , to study and to know , a great poet , and in the belief that
Browning	PERSON	, like every other , would be better enjoyed by repeated reading , more appreciated in proportion as better known .

		The work of the
Boston Browning Society	ORGANIZATION	has been conducted in this spirit , and , numbering in its mem - bership such thinkers and writers as Col.
Thomas Wentworth Higginson	PERSON	, Mr.
Josiah Royce	PERSON	, Mr.
George Willis Cooke	PERSON	, Dr.
William J. Rolfe	PERSON	, Mr.
Charles Carroll Everett	PERSON	,
Miss Vida D. Scudder	PERSON	, and many others as able , though perhaps less known to fame , the result reflects no small glory upon con - temporary literary criticism in
America	LOCATION	.

		In this praise it is only fair to include the admirable and full Index made by
Miss Dame	ORGANIZATION	, and the handsome setting given the volume by the
Macmillan Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		The elaborate religious rituals of the The Religion of the anc i en t Egyptians have attracted the Ancient Egyptian * .

		J f r , , .

		attention of students of comparative religion for the last twenty years .

		One good fea - ture of the study is the fact that we have a half - dozen works written by Egyptian scholars , who have translated the original texts for themselves .

		Dr.
Wiedemann	PERSON	, the author of the work before us , 254 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, '' The Religion of the Ancient Egyptians '' -LRB- Put - nam -RRB- , a Professor in the
University of Bonn	ORGANIZATION	, Ger - many , now gives us his translations and interpre - tation of the religious texts of
Egypt	LOCATION	.

		Though containing much that is technical , the book is ad - mirably adapted for the popular , if somewhat scholarly , thinker and reader .

		The chapters of the book are discussions of these among other topics : Sun worship , solar myths , the passage of the sun through the under world , chief deities , foreign deities , worship of animals ,
Osiris	PERSON	and his cycle , the Osirian doctrine of immortality , magic and sorcery , and amulets .

		By means of translations of the texts and of seventy-three illustrations , the author puts his theme in a clear-cut , concise , and attractive form .

		The point of view of Dr.
Wiedemann	PERSON	is not always in agreement with that of his co-workers in the field of Egyptian lore , but he wisely presents , without wearisome and long-drawn-out discussion , the view most acceptable to his own mind .

		One of the chief points where universal agreement has not been reached is wisely handled by him in the fol - lowing statement -LRB- pp. 109 , 110 -RRB- : `` It is vain to draw far-reaching conclusions as to the fundamen - tal ideas of the ancient Egyptian religion .

		... It can not be proved from the inscriptions that no such conception -LSB- as monotheism -RSB- existed in
Ancient Egypt	LOCATION	.

		In view of the repeated attempts to bring the Egyptian religion forward in evidence , now on the one side and now on the other , in the discussion concerning an early monotheism , the fact must be emphasized again and again that no trustworthy evidence whatever is as yet afforded to either side by our knowledge of that religion .

		Among the chapters of the volume there is none of more inter - est than that on '' The Osirian Doctrine of Immor - tality , '' also that on '' The Worship of Animals . ''

		The whole volume presents many correctives of cur - rent erroneous views of Egyptian worship and de - serves the most careful consideration of every stu - dent of comparative religion .

		In Professor
Carl C. Plehn	PERSON	's '' Intro - duc tf < > n t Pablic Finance '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- , we welcome the first Ameri - can work which attempts to treat the entire subject .

		We have many valuable monographs by American authors , covering different phases , but until the ap - pearance of this little treatise we were obliged to seek for scientific treatment of the whole field in other countries than ours .

		The attempt has here been made to present the fundamental principles of the science in a condensed form suitable for class - room use .

		The author gives in his preface the purpose of the book . ''

		There can be no doubt that the most pressing reforms of the close of the nine - teenth century are tax reforms .

		The rapid exten - sion of governmental functions , the invasion by the government of fields of activity that lie near to the welfare of the people , has given rise to great interest in the financial side of these activities .

		It is hoped that this work may be helpful in the accom - plishment of these needed reforms . ''

		Public expen - ditures , public revenues , public indebtedness , and financial administration , are the main divisions of the subject .

		The author endeavors to remedy de - fects in previous treatises on the subject , and to es - tablish a uniformity of classification which shall hold through his entire work .

		The method adopted is that suggested by Professor
Cohn	PERSON	for all public charges , the relation of contributions demanded to benefits conferred .

		The author follows his classifi - cation consistently , though laboring under evident difficulty at times in making his topic fit the classi - fication .

		The comparative study of financial systems is carried only so far as to include those of the
United States	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and
England	LOCATION	.

		We can hardly look for exhaustive treatment of any phase of the subject in a book of this size , the sections devoted to the various kinds of taxes are especially disappointing .

		Yet the book fills an urgent want , and is admirable for its intended purpose .

		An analysis of the forces controlling the g rowth a nd * he differentiation of the developing organism , and of the laws under which they operate , has been sought by the method of experiment upon the living egg .

		The salient achievements of this rising science of experi - mental embryology are set forth in Professor
T. H. Morgan	PERSON	's '' The Development of the Frog 's Egg '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		A full outline of the normal devel - opment is given , from the formation of the sex-cells to the hatching of the tadpole .

		The main emphasis of the work is laid , however , upon those alterations in the usual course of development which attend the introduction of new factors into the environ - ment of the egg .

		Rotation in a centrifugal ma - chine , pressure , inversion , mutilation , a weak salt solution , all result in characteristic abnormalities .

		Even the individuality of the organism is a toy in the hands of the experimenter ; from half-eggs half-embryos can be produced , but if the half-egg be inverted a whole embryo of half-size results .

		Subdivision of the egg -LRB- of the sea-urchin -RRB- gives several embryos , where normal development would have produced but one .

		A suggestive discussion of the results thus far attained is placed before the intending student , but he must still look to the orig - inal sources for an adequate account of the methods employed .

		HOW wealth is Dr -
Spahr	PERSON	's recent work entitled `` An distributed in the Essay on the
Present Distribution United	ORGANIZATION	states .

		of Wealth in the
United States	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- is a valuable contribution to the study of ex - isting society , and is suggestive and stimulating in its clear and forceful presentation of facts and figures .

		Statistical and dry are not synonymous terms as far as this volume is concerned .

		The subject is treated under the three heads of
Distribution of Property	ORGANIZATION	, Distribution of Incomes , and
Distribution of Taxes	ORGANIZATION	.

		It begins with a retrospect of English conditions since the Middle Ages , and reaches the startling
1897	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 255 conclusion '' that less than
2 per cent	MONEY	of the families of the
United Kingdom	ORGANIZATION	hold about as much private property as all the remainder , and that 93 per cent of the people hold less than
8 per cent	MONEY	of the accu - mulated wealth . ''

		In the
United States	LOCATION	, the line of cleavage on questions of property is not between East and `` West , as is usually thought , but between city and country , the natural result of the rapid in - dustrial concentration in business centres .

		Here , again , 1 per cent of the families of the
United States	LOCATION	receive one-quarter of its entire income .

		The author 's conclusions lead naturally to a consideration of our much-deplored system of taxation , with its inequalities and consequent injustices .

		A remedy is not to be found , the author insists , in equal taxa - tion of property , even could that be secured .

		The public will demand , as a cure for its ills , a progres - sive property tax . ''

		The public welfare is the supreme law , and the heart and conscience of the nation are bound to give effect to measures which shall make the wealth of the nation synonymous with the national well-being . ''

		To the story of the Indian and of the MIne ' in the '' Stor y of the West '' series -LRB- Appleton -RRB- , Mr.
E. Hough	PERSON	has added the '' Story of the Cowboy . ''

		In the rapidly passing panorama of the development of the great West , the cowboy has always stood for the extreme of picturesqueness .

		Mr.
Hough	PERSON	has not shorn him of any glamour or romance , but in addition gives a realization of the extent of his kingdom , the magni - tude of the interests entrusted to him , and the courage and hardihood necessary to his daily work .

		The reader of this most interesting book is brought into vivid touch with daily life on the plains , participates in '' round-ups , '' chases the predatory 41 rustler , '' and anathematizes '' strays '' and ''
Maver	PERSON	- icks . ''

		The last chapter is a plea for the cowboy to be regarded in history , not as an eccentric driver of horned cattle , but as a man suited to the times .

		He disappeared because of the small landholder , the sheep-herder , the fence-builder , and especially the irrigator .

		The mind 's eye is aided in forming these pictures of the past by the page illustrations in the book from the brush of Mr.
Russell	PERSON	, himself a dweller on a
Montana	LOCATION	ranch .

		A students conception of literature as a fit handbook of subject for systematic study in the literary art .

		schools is comparatively so new that each person , student or teacher , has been obliged largely to form his own methods of examining its contents and of defining the principles of its art .

		Neither the rhetorics nor the outlines of the his - tory of literature have thrown much light upon the principles which each critic must apply , at one point or another , whenever he writes a review , or in any way discusses a written composition .

		Miss
Harriet Noble	PERSON	, in offering '' A Handbook for the Study of Literary Art '' -LRB-
Inland Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , has done a real service to students , whether in school or out .

		The purpose of the book is to lead the stu - dent to recognize literary work as art ; to collect and define all the more essential properties of this art connectedly , and to exemplify their application in systematic analysis .

		Schedules are presented intended to cover the essential characteristics of the three great classes of writing poems , dramas , novels .

		Themes , plans , amplification , versification , style , are the subjects of chapters containing much direct and suggestive material for the inexperienced lover of good literature .

		The concluding chapter , '' Final Verdicts , '' is an up-to-date discussion of such modern literary forms as the compound tale , made up of a number of single poems , after the manner of
Tennyson	LOCATION	; the dramatic monologue ,
Browning	PERSON	's favorite form ; symbolism , as practised by
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	,
Maeterlinck	PERSON	,
William Sharp	PERSON	, and others .

		The book is to be highly commended for doing well something that much needed doing .

		When the
Dean of Norwich	ORGANIZATION	projected Lectures on * i i _ j i j the Fathers .

		a course * lectures to be delivered in
Norwich Cathedral	LOCATION	, presumably in
1895	DATE	or
1896	DATE	, and with the evident intention of having the lectures subsequently published in book form , he selected for the general subject `` The Fathers . ''

		It is somewhat curious to find these lec - tures now collected and published under the title '' Lectures on Ecclesiastical History '' -LRB-
Thomas Whittaker	PERSON	-RRB- .

		It is also curious to find sandwiched in between a lecture on the life and times of St.
Ambrose	PERSON	and one on
Jerome	PERSON	, an essay -LRB- evidently not a lecture -RRB- on the Church in the
Catacombs	LOCATION	.

		Books thus prepared are more apt to exhibit a variety of literary styles than any other character - istic .

		And books on Church history thus produced are apt to present divergent views on some subjects of minor importance .

		This has been avoided in the present case by the care exercised by the Dean to select his lectures among Churchmen of the grade established by
Dean Farrar	PERSON	, who delivered the first lecture in the course , upon Ignatius and
Polycarp	ORGANIZATION	.

		The French , Every attempt to trace the real birth Revolution .

United	ORGANIZATION	to Americans .

		States must end at the varying in - fluence of the French Revolution on the citizens of this youthful republic .

		Jefferson and
Hamilton	PERSON	were but captains in the great line-up of sympathy or condemnation , the old against the new , the tried against the visionary .

		Students have there - fore gone constantly to every source which would indicate contemporary feeling on this subject , and especially to
Gouverneur Morris	PERSON	,
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	, and
James Monroe	PERSON	, who were capable eye-witnesses to many scenes of that great drama .

		But pressure upon the time of the student and reader has caused a compilation to be made , not alone of the sources indicated above , but of all '' Contemporary Ameri - can Opinion of the French Revolution , '' by Professor
Hazen	PERSON	of
Smith College	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is scarcely just to speak of the work as a compilation , since the author has , 256 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, especially in the opinion of contemporaries at home , traced a connecting line and formed a concluding opinion which enables him to present his own views .

		But as a short cut to scattered matter the work will prove most useful .

		It comes as an '' extra volume '' in the ''
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	University Studies . ''

		Another Jubilee Boole .

		One of the more noteworthy of the hundred and one books about the Queen and her reign , brought out on the occasion of her Diamond Jubilee , is '' The
Pri	ORGANIZATION	- vate Life of the Queen , by a Member of the
Royal Household	ORGANIZATION	, '' published in this country by the Messrs.
Appleton	PERSON	.

		The book is sufficiently characterized by one sentence in the author 's preface : '' My con - cern is merely with the petty personal details of the greatest woman of her time ... '' The writer is evidently a woman , and , we conjecture , a former maid-of-honor .

		The minuteness of her information will give pleasure to the curious , while her refuta - tion of a number of false reports and correction of wrong impressions concerning her sovereign will gratify the latter 's admirers .

		Eleven good half - tone illustrations enliven the text .

		But why could not the author have eulogized the Queen without murdering the Queen 's English ?

		Too frequent for the entire enjoyment of the reader are such inele - gant constructions as the following : '' To the right are a magnificent line of fourteen vineries , broken only in the centre by Mr.
Owen Thomas	PERSON	's , the head gardener , picturesque house . ''

		The fourth volume of Mr.
Donald G.	PERSON	, el
Mitchell	PERSON	's '' English Lands , Letters , and Kings '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- deals with the period of
the Later Georges	ORGANIZATION	to
Victoria	LOCATION	.

		It opens upon that always delightful country of hills and waters known as the
Lake District of England	LOCATION	, and pictures the interesting lives of its illustrious brotherhood of poets and essayists , passes on to Scott at
Abbotsford	LOCATION	, to
Edinboro	LOCATION	' and its famous '' Re - view , '' full of power and pyrotechnics , to
London	LOCATION	and
Walter Savage Landor	PERSON	, '' master of classicism , master of language , but never quite master of him - self , '' and so on to the great names of the beginning of the century ,
Byron	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	,
Keats	PERSON	.

		Only the very early days of
Victoria	LOCATION	's reign come into view , and thus we may look forward to at least one more volume in this delightful series the sooner the better , for these little books have a certain charm distinct from any others , one which age can not wither nor custom stale for those who read and loved '' Ik Marvel '' when both they and he were young .

		Some resurrected Between the years
1820	DATE	and
1823	DATE	, pot-Miing work
Thomas Carlyle	PERSON	did much `` pot - oj
Carlyle	LOCATION	.

		boiling '' work for ''
Brewster	PERSON	's Ed - inburgh Encyclopaedia , '' in the shape of biograph - ical essays . ''

		Wretched lives , '' he himself called them in his atrabiliary moments ; at other times , he confessed that he was seldom happier than when writing them .

		Brief as most of these writings are , and hardly to be ranked with his greater efforts , , they are yet fragments of honest , clear-lined work - manship , and certainly worth rescuing from the densely piled , double-columned debris of the ency - clopaedia .

		There are seventeen of these sketches in all ; and being prefaced by a sympathetic intro - duction from the author 's fellow-Scotsman , Mr.
S. R. Crockett	PERSON	, and given a handsome dress by the pub - lishers -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , the book , which bears the title `` Montaigne and Other Essays , '' will be welcomed by all lovers of
Carlyle	LOCATION	.

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Professor
L. Oscar Kuhns	PERSON	is the author of a little treatise on '' The
Treatment of Nature	ORGANIZATION	in
Dante	LOCATION	's ' Divine Comedy ' '' -LRB- Arnold -RRB- , which proves to be a very creditable piece of work . ''

		Nature '' is , of course , taken in the modern sense of the term , rather than the metaphysical sense in which
Dante	ORGANIZATION	himself used it .

		The quotations and parallel passages of which the book largely consists are grouped under such heads as
Italy	LOCATION	, the Flora , the Fauna , Atmospheric Phenomena , and the Heavenly Bodies .

		Professor
Kuhns	PERSON	has also published -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- an edition of
Gary	PERSON	's translation of the '' Divine Comedy , '' together with
Rossetti	PERSON	's translation of '' The New Life . ''

		Some of
Gary	PERSON	's notes are retained , others are provided by the editor , and a good introduction prefaces the text .

		It remains to be said that the volume is a handsome one , and illustrated by an extensive series of well-chosen photographs .

		The volumes in the Dent-Macmillan series of `` Temple Classics '' and '' Temple Dramatists '' continue to multi - ply .

		In the first-named series the latest to reach us are Vols .

		II .

		and III .

		of
Boswell	ORGANIZATION	's
Johnson	PERSON	, and Vols .

		IV .

		and
V. of Montaigne	ORGANIZATION	's essays -LRB- both works to be com - pleted in six volumes -RRB- ; and
Chapman	PERSON	's translation of the '' Odyssey '' in two volumes .

		In the series of '' Dramatists '' we have lately had four new volumes , comprising : ''
Edward III.	PERSON	, '' edited by Mr.
G. C. Moore Smith	PERSON	;
Sheridan	PERSON	's '' The Rivals '' and The Critic , '' both edited by Mr.
G. A. Aitken	PERSON	; and
Fletcher	PERSON	's The Faithful Shepherdess , '' edited by Mr.
F. W. Moorman	PERSON	.

		From the same publishers we have received ''
Bon	PERSON	- Mots of the
Eighteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, '' issued in their dainty series of '' Bon-Mots , '' of which Mr.
Walter Jerrold	PERSON	is the editor .

		Miss
Alice B. Woodward	PERSON	's numerous little '' grotesques '' scattered throughout this volume add greatly to its attractiveness . ''

		The Story of Jean Valjean '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- , edited by Miss
Sara E. Wiltse	PERSON	, is a volume in the series of '' Classics for Children . ''

		It amounts to a translation of `` Les Mise * rables , '' without some of the digressions of the original .

		As there are over a thousand pages in this version , it will be seen that the excisions are not con - siderable .

		The famous '' Confessions '' of
Jean Jacques Rous	PERSON	- seau , in the English translation published anonymously a century ago , comes to us in the prettiest of reprints , with an introduction by Mr.
S. W. Orson	PERSON	.

		There are four volumes , with illustrations after the designs made by
M. Maurice Leloir	PERSON	.

		The imprint is that of
Messrs. Gibbings & Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	, and the work is sold in this country by the
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		THE DIAL 257 LITERARY NOTES .

		The
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	has just published a new edition of Mr.
John	PERSON	La Farge 's '' An Artist 's Letters from
Japan	LOCATION	. ''

		`` Seraphita , '' `` The Seamy Side of History , '' and '' Cousin Betty , '' are three new volumes in the Dent - Macmillau edition of Balzac . ''

		Tom
Moore	PERSON	in
Bermuda	LOCATION	'' is the title of a brochure written and published by Mr.
J. C. Lawrence Clark	PERSON	, of
Lancaster	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	.

		It is '' a bit of literary gossip , '' attract - ively written and illustrated . ''

		How to Build a Home '' is the title of an excellent little book of Mr.
Francis C. Moore	PERSON	, just published by the
Doubleday & McClure Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Story of Germ Life , '' by Professor
H. W. Conn	PERSON	, is published by the Messrs.
Appleton	PERSON	in their series of little books of popular science called '' The Library of Useful Stories . ''

		Volume IV .

		of ''
Cromwell	PERSON	, '' the life of Sterling , and '' Past and Present , '' are the three latest volumes in the '' Centenary '' edition of
Carlyle	LOCATION	, published by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		We are pleased to hear that Dr.
H. H. Furness	PERSON	has finished editing '' A
Winter	DATE	's Tale , '' which will soon appear as a new volume of the '' Variorum '' Shakes - peare , published by the
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is interesting to know that the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	, in establishing an American branch , has incor - porated it under the laws of
New York	LOCATION	, its business being carried on by a staff of American citizens , with Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	as president . ''

		Tales of Humor , '' '' Romance , '' and '' Little Master - pieces '' are the titles of three small volumes of short stories just issued by the new publishing house , the
Doubleday & McClure Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The latter of the three contains tales from
Poe	PERSON	, edited by Mr.
Bliss Perry	PERSON	.

		Messrs.
D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers of a '' Natural History , '' the work of Mr.
R. Lydekker	PERSON	and other specialists , which provides , in a compact volume of nearly eight hundred pages , a trustworthy survey of the animal kingdom as at present known to science . ''

		The Dictionary of the Bible , '' planned by
Robertson Smith	PERSON	, and since his death carried on by Professor
Cheyne	PERSON	and Dr.
Sutherland Black	PERSON	, is making steady progress , and five-sixths of the whole material is now in the editors ' hands .

		The work will form a single very large volume , and be published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		One would hardly look for `` literature '' in the annual '' Report of the Commissioner of Education , '' but the first volume of that valuable work for 1895-96 contains at least one paper of high literary value .

		It is the account of '' Early Educational Life in
Middle Georgia	LOCATION	, '' prepared for the
Bureau of Education	ORGANIZATION	by Colonel
Richard Malcolm Johnston	PERSON	, and quite as enter - taining as the fiction of that genial writer .

		A volume of `` Selected Masterpieces of Biblical Literature '' has been edited by Professor
R. G. Moulton	PERSON	for The Modern Reader 's Bible , '' and is published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		From the same publishers we have , in their series of '' Economic Classics , '' a reprint of
Augustin Cournot	PERSON	's '' Researches into the Mathematical Principles of the Theory of Wealth , '' which appeared in
1838	DATE	.

		The translation of the latter work is by Mr.
Nathaniel T. Bacon	PERSON	.


Francis Turner Palgrave	PERSON	, known to all readers as the editor of the best anthology of English lyrics ever com - piled , died on the twenty-fourth of
October	DATE	, at the age of seventy-three .

		A student of
Balliol	LOCATION	, a fellow of
Exeter	LOCATION	, and Professor of Poetry to the
University	ORGANIZATION	, Pal - grave was all his life long an Oxford man and little else .

		He was an original poet of considerable merit , and a critic of no mean achievement , but it is as the editor of '' The Golden Treasury '' that he will be best remem - bered .


Justin Winsor	PERSON	, for many years Librarian of
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	, died at his home in
Cambridge	LOCATION	on the twenty-second of
last month	DATE	.

		He was born in
Boston	LOCATION	,
January 2 , 1831	DATE	, and obtained his education first at
Harvard	LOCATION	, then in
Heidelberg	LOCATION	and
Paris	LOCATION	.

		In
1868	DATE	, he became Superintendent of the
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, leaving that institution for
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	in
1877	DATE	.

		Besides being one of the leaders in his profession for a quarter of a century , he was one of the foremost of American historians .

		His ungraceful style will always debar him from taking rank with
Parkman	PERSON	and
Motley	ORGANIZATION	in popular favor , but his work has qualities of solid scholarship that insure it the esteem of them that know .

		His most important works are the '' Memorial History of
Boston	LOCATION	'' and the '' Life of
Christopher Columbus	PERSON	, '' while the great '' Narrative and Critical History of
America	LOCATION	'' was edited by him with such discerning judgment and range of scholarship that his fame will rest upon that work quite as much as upon his original contributions to historical and cartographical knowledge .

		The death of
Charles Anderson Dana	PERSON	, on the seven - teenth of
October	DATE	, removed from American journalism one of its most conspicuous figures .

		Mr.
Dana	PERSON	was born
August 8 , 1819	DATE	, in
New Hampshire	LOCATION	, and spent his boyhood in
Buffalo	LOCATION	.

		He entered
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	in
1839	DATE	, but was compelled by defective eyesight to give up his studies for the time , and soon thereafter attached him - self for a brief period to the
Brook Farm	ORGANIZATION	community , which accident , rather than serious significance , has made so famous an episode in
New England	LOCATION	history .

		After a few years of miscellaneous journalism , he became managing editor of the
New York	LOCATION	'' Tribune , '' retaining that connection until
1862	DATE	.

		He was then employed by the War department at
Washington	LOCATION	for several years , then embarked upon a short-lived newspaper enterprise in
Chicago	LOCATION	, and finally , in
1867	DATE	, became the proprietor and editor of the
New York	LOCATION	'' Sun . ''

		It is as the editor of that journal that he is best known , although he did a certain amount of fairly creditable literary work .

		In spite of its excellence in make-up , in the use of language , and in the collection of news -LRB- or rather , perhaps , because of those qualities , so admirable in themselves -RRB- , the '' Sun '' has exercised a deeply demoralizing effect upon American journalism , and the remarkable abilities of its editor have usually been put to the worst possible use .

		There has hardly been a scoundrel in public life during the past generation whom the '' Sun '' has not championed , hardly a vicious measure of government that it has not espoused .

		On the other hand , it has waged persistent warfare upon men whom the nation has delighted to honor , and upon reforms that have enlisted in their behalf the best elements of the entire community , and all this with a malignity , a vindictive - ness , and an unscrupulous mendacity that have rarely been approached even in American journalism .

		In thus outraging both the intelligence and the moral sentiment of the public , the paper has gone so far as to defeat its own purposes , and in this fact must be sought whatever compensation there is for the degradation of its thirty years ' presence among us .

$ 1000	MONEY	PRIZE STORY .

		The Days of Mohammed .

		By
ANNA MAT WILSON	PERSON	.

		Yusaf , a Persian , of the Guebre , or fire-worshipping sect , has , at his first sacrifice of a human life , revolted against the horror of his religion .

		He conceives a vague idea of a different God , his whole soul calls out for light in his darkness , and he decides to leave
Persia	LOCATION	in search of Truth .

		In his travels he hears of the famous Caaba , or temple , at
Mecca	LOCATION	, and , in the hope that he may find what he seeks , he sets out for that city .

		There he meets that strangest char - acter of ancient or mediaeval times , Mohammed .

		In '' The Days of Mohammed '' the author attempts to show the manner and result of the priest 's quest , and endeavors to exemplify , in the career of Yusuf and that of his contem - poraries , the change which the realization of a companionship with God brings into each life .

		The scene of the story is confined almost entirely to
Arabia	LOCATION	, and the plot is based upon the early
Mohammedan	DATE	war , in which , for the first time , was raised the cry , '' The sword of God and the prophet ! ''

		that dread cry which has been re - echoed through the centuries , and has , in our own time , been brought home with such heart-piercing force to all who have looked upon the terrible atrocities but lately committed in
Armenia	LOCATION	.

		291 A NEW IDEAL IN
AMERICAN FICTION	ORGANIZATION	.

		No student of American life and literature , however slight his claim to the title , can have failed to observe that in the past few years a marked if not vital change has come over American fiction .

		As the century draws to a close , it becomes evident that the fiction of its last decade is to be chronicled as presenting almost a contrast to that of the decade preced - ing it , and this even more in the radical matters of spirit and choice of subject than in the matter of art .

		In the eighties , the American ideal of fiction was summed up in the magical and much - abused word '' realism , '' by which was meant , sometimes the analysis of character , sometimes the delicate and subtle setting forth of episode , and sometimes the portrayal of life as it ap - pears on the surface , with only floating hints as to its great undercurrents of motive and passion .

		It was generally thought that '' in some way or other , the stories had all been told '' ; and it was thought , too , that the history of a soul , to be artistically rendered , should be written as by one who stood without and guessed , rather than as by one who stood within and knew .

		Life , it was argued , has such and such an appearance therefore , paint it so , and leave the picture to be interpreted as it may be ; in like manner , the greater passions and emotions are generally hidden under a mask of conventionality , and the artist should show the mask , letting the secret things be guessed at .

		That this ideal has been followed by some of our rarest talent , and that the work it necessitated was often of great artistic beauty , is not to be denied ; and we remember , also , that its followers have at times overstepped their own prescribed bounds , to deal with the openly sublime , magnificent , or beautiful .

		But it was too limited an ideal to compel any long period of service , save from a scattered few ; it was not realism in the larger sense , but only a phase of it ; and as a popular ideal of fiction -LRB- one says '' popular '' with an inward surety of contradiction -RRB- it has given way to another , limited itself , but of greater stature and richer life-blood .

		But while the fiction of the former ideal 270 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, gave us life highly individualized , and falls therefore into the realm of realistic art , the fiction of the present day does not belong en - tirely to the realm of ideal art ; it strives , indeed , to give '' life essential , '' but it would also pre - sent the individual life .

		It differs from the other insomuch as its tendency is toward the typical rather than the single ; insomuch as it is apt to show the growth of a soul rather than to analyze a given character ; insomuch as it chooses , not the commonplace , in which realism found its best material , but the high , the heroic , the confessedly great or tragic or pathetic ele - ments of human life .

		We are reading as in ''
Hugh Wynne	PERSON	'' stories of the Revolu - tion , where , not so many years ago , we read analyses of modern society ; we are reading as in the work of Mr.
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	and Mrs.
Catherwood	PERSON	of men who , in peril and daring and conquest , renew for us the youth of our race ; we are reading as in '' The Choir Invisible '' of great spirits , fighting their way upward to peace through the hardships and mistakes of earth .

		We speak of this fiction as belonging to the present decade ; but immediately comes the correction that the new note was at least set vibrating in the latter part of the eighties , by such pieces of fiction as ''
Marse Chan	PERSON	, '' '' The White Cowl , '' and '' The Romance of Dollard , '' stories that seized upon naked pathos , pas - sion , and splendor , and presented them with no affectation of indifference .

		But these and a few like them were only the heralds of the changed order .

		At this time American fiction is almost entirely occupied with the heroic affairs of life with bold self-sacrifices , with magnificent fidelities , with the signal passions of love and hate and war , with man 's sin and penitence and expiation .

		Even our short stories deal with these high matters ; and the writer who has won the most immediate popu - larity of his day , and has set a style for the emulation of others , is a young man who dared to take a youth of
New York	LOCATION	fashion-dom , put a forsaken child in his arms , and send him out at
midnight	TIME	to deliver a speech of quiet but intense appeal to the child 's unloving father .

		The public critical and uncritical , sensitive and dull was ready at that very time for such expressions of feeling ; so ready that it would accept even sentimentalities from one who had proved his power over genuine emotion .

		That this fiction should be considered '' ro - mantic '' is not at all strange ; and if by * romanticism '' is meant the revival of wonder at the mystery and the greatness of life , the adjective is well applied .

		There has been such a revival , the second in our century , and it has struck out two broad avenues of expression the one , fiction ; the other , the historical essay .

		Our interest in our own history , in the splendid makings of our nation , in those stirring scenes of which our near fathers were the protagonists , is as much a part of this romanticism as our most romantic fiction which , indeed , is fath - ered by historical research .

		And the argument from all this is greatly in our favor .

		Despite the mock-heroics and sentimentalities which are foisted on us in its name , despite the invitation which it extends to a lower order of talent , to a weak or flamboyant art , it is a movement which '' means intensely and means good . ''

		When it takes the form of history , it signifies a deepening of our national consciousness and a desire to be worthy of the courage from which we sprang ; when it takes the form of fiction , it is a sign that we are thinking of the majestic proportions of humanity , of the nobler possi - bilities of our nature .

		It is well for us , both as public and as individuals , to have a day of such great things ; their effect upon us is , in some measure , the effect of the sublime epics of the world , of the beautiful sculpture and painting and architecture and music , under the spell of which our pettiness falls away from us like a garment , and we are raptured by the glory of life .

		This new fiction has faults and shortcomings , but at its best it can stir the blood , it can rouse the larger emotions , it can cheer the soul .

		For it is based on this truth : that , though our more ordinary affairs may furnish a great part of the gamut of tragedy and comedy , the things which appeal to all men as great or brave or lovely or pathetic are also , and as deeply , the verities of our existence .

STEELE ANDERSON	PERSON	.

		TEACHING ENGLISH FOR A LIVE - LIHOOD .

		One factor in the recent notable and somewhat unwieldy development of the English Department in our American universities has been , probably , the necessity for a livelihood for college men .

		The field was attractive , but offered accommodations for few .

		The influx of settlers necessitated the staking of new claims .

		English teachers in ten years have multiplied like a Klondike census ; English courses like mining enterprises in
Alaska	LOCATION	.

		Prospecting has crossed all bounds and got clear out of touch from
1897	DATE	. -RSB-

		271 reason and tradition .

		Under the name of English go on all manner of destructive practices , and soon we shall not recognize our classics under the rubbish - heaps of the new camps .

		The ranks of all professions contain those who have had -LRB- as it is said in the case of the ministry -RRB- no '' call '' ; who have entered where the least resist - ance was .

		The English teaching profession , as everyone knows , is no exception .

		We can all count the '' uncalled '' of our professional acquaintance in multiples of the '' called '' ; and if in the end we are all found somewhere in the first list , we may wink at the joke and still be very sure that the difference is there with the distinction , nevertheless .

		The new impetus given to the study a dozen years ago affected at first only the writing side of English .

		The reforms , once started , soon ran headlong .

		From increased attention to writing we went on to enlarge the field of literary study .

		Colleges that had employed one man to teach the entire subject began to appoint instructors for particular subdi - visions of the work .

		Literature and linguistics were early drawn apart , the chair in the larger universities being divided into two .

		Rhetoric and composition were set off as a third chair .

		This line of division complete , a new tack was taken .

		Literature was divided , and we got in some cases a chair of Ameri - can Literature .

		This was not enough , and soon we saw chairs of the history of English literature and of mere literature , of Elizabethan literature and of Restoration literature , of
Eighteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	and of
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	literature .

		And where separate departments were not thus created , the work of in - struction was distributed to assistants specially pre - pared in the respective subdivisions .

		But the end was not yet .

		Each teacher must offer many courses .

		Periods were subdivided indefinitely , and individual authors began to receive microscopic attention .

		Entire courses in a single writer became the vogue , and almost any literary figure , irrespective of his importance , was put down in one announcement or another as the subject of a semester 's work .

		So minute is this subdivision of the subject at last , that twenty representative American universities average twenty courses each .

		Some offer fifty courses and have half as many instructors .

		* This multitude of courses in English that has come to string out our university catalogues , to allure the '' snap '' - seeking student , and to keep busy a surplusage of instructors , is in itself evidence that something has overreached itself .

		For the most part , the abuses resulting from the attempt to make too much of one author are so familiar as to require only passing reference .

		To this class belongs the sort of course that attempts to blend literary with philological study , with the invariable result that the literary is swamped by the philological from the start .

		A favorite victim for this sacrifice is Chaucer .

		If as much as twelve weeks be allotted to this poet in a reading course , one is obliged to resort to linguis - * See `` English in American Universities . ''

		tics to fill out the time .

		The result always , by a kind of
Gresham	PERSON	's Law , is that the technical drives out the aesthetic . ''

		The Canterbury Tales '' in most universities is a word-chasing course of the worst type ; students get no notion of Chaucer 's charm , nor often any notion at all about him save that he is a great bore and a fine fellow to cut .

		The drawing out of poetical studies by drills in versification , and of prose studies by mechanical examination of the rhetoric ; the still inextinct bar - barism of attending more to the man or to what criticism has to say of him than to the man 's work , one hurries over these to notice the most curious perversion of all .

		This is the '' counting '' fad .

		It is research work , and prevails chiefly in graduate schools .

		A subject is chosen for investigation , say a certain poet 's '' use of color . ''

		The student goes to work with notebook and pencil , rather with many notebooks and many pencils , to get up statistics that will show what colors and shades the poet mentions most and least .

		The process is simple : all the reds , oranges , yellows , and so forth , are counted ; in the end , totals are compared , and
Whittier	LOCATION	, let us say , is declared to incline to green , blue , indigo , or vio - let , or to bright tints rather than sombre ; or perhaps
Whittier	LOCATION	makes very little or very great use of color in general .

		This color study is a popular one among student specialists in English , and , sad to say , it is not undertaken by women alone .

		The men , how - ever , mainly attack topics seemingly less mild .

		A poet 's '' treatment of nature '' is often the subject of investigation .

		Here , as before , we get columns of figures , only more of them .

		The counting is given a wider scope .

		The animals and vegetables -LRB- even the minerals sometimes -RRB- are listed and carefully assorted , the wild species being separated from the domestic .

		Again , a poet 's use of figures of speech is the subject .

		A friend spent the whole of
last winter	DATE	counting the metaphors and similes , and cases of personification and Natur-beseelung in
Keats	LOCATION	, with the view of determining if there were more of one than of another .

		Other friends in other universi - ties are spending best years counting
Browning	PERSON	!


Wordsworth	PERSON	's employment of the pathetic fallacy has been reduced to a mathematical statement , and no great poet is permitted to rest in peace .

		The '' cahtter about Shelley '' has been succeeded by a very perfect analysis and census in detail of
Shel	PERSON	- ley 's poetical anatomy .

		And this sort of thing is spreading .

		If we could overhear it , there is in too many colleges the statistical and the chemical talk about books ; and even in high-schools one may hear to a fine point of Spenser 's greens and
Tennyson	PERSON	's grays , till one knows not but he has got into a dye - house by mistake . ''

		There is a way of killing truth by truths : under the pretense that we want to study it more in detail , we pulverize the statue . ''

		Amiel might almost have had some of the current methods in English imme - diately in mind .

		The pretense is usually present in these labored studies .

		The color census finds its origin and a modicum of justification in the desire 272 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, to verify or correct , for example , a quite general impression that
Shelley	PERSON	employs many blues and akyey effects , or
Swinburne	PERSON	sea effects and greens .

		But it has yet to be announced if such efforts have brought to light any worthy facts unapparent to observing readers on the surface .

		The effect of the
October	DATE	meadow yonder is brown : you need not count me the brown spears of grass to prove it ; the driving wind and the flakes in the face are proof enough of the blizzard : you may spare to measure us the snow-drifts .

		To be sure , there is one ex - tremely practical final cause of the counting , namely , the making of a thesis and the achievement of an advanced degree .

		If '' Paradise Lost '' is taken apart beyond possibility of ever being put together again , yea , and ground up past recognition into very powder , there is at least this to show for it : the particles make quite effective ammunition for the loading of masters ' and doctors ' theses .

		The papers on
Milton	PERSON	that look like census tables may strike us as doubtful reading , but we may be very sure they are all '' good stuff '' for degrees .

		Aside from this , there is no excuse for much that is done in the name of English .

		It is scholasticism pure and simple ; it is the attempt to make something out of nothing .

		The fact is , many American universities , perhaps American universities as a class , are trying to get too much out of literature . ''

		Well , '' one says , '' we are only trying to get out of it what there is in it . ''

		* But it is hard to believe that we get so much more out of English literature than the English universi - ties themselves , and the Scottish and the Irish .

		By the British plan , immediate contact with a successful man of letters insures this stimulation .

		Professor

Kempis	LOCATION	, as against those of the learned and studious scholar .

		Ten of the latter will not cover the lack of the one .

		We have gone too far in our so-called '' modern '' En - glish teaching , and it will be well when we reverse the lever and allow play to a healthy reaction that will reduce the number while scrutinizing the fitness of both courses and men .

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		THE CRERAR LIBRARY AND THE WISHES OP ITS FOUNDER .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I knew the late
John Crerar	PERSON	well , and I think the point made by T.V.V. in his letter printed in your last issue is properly taken .

		It seems to me that the use of the
Crerar Bequest	ORGANIZATION	for the formation of an '' exclusively scientific library '' is a violation of a sacred memorial trust .

		When I first knew Mr.
Crerar	PERSON	he was the president of a
Library Association	ORGANIZATION	in
New York City	LOCATION	, and I was an assistant in the library .

		Some years after , when I had become the librarian of another institution , whose library had been formed by me , he called upon me and was much interested in my work and plans .

		He was a reticent man , and he told me nothing of his intentions , but I somehow formed a notion that he intended to found a great library , and I felt at the time that I should like , above all things , to be in a library of which he was the founder .

		We talked , among other matters , at this last meeting that I had with him , of the relative importance of history and literature and of science as means of the highest culture and of human improvement .

		I remem - ber showing him some opinions of eminent men in regard to the subject of our conversation .

		Dr.
Samuel Johnson	PERSON	was one of these writers in whose views Mr.
Crerar	PERSON	was particularly interested .

		It is extraordinary that a sacred public trust , like that founded by
John Crerar	PERSON	, established , or intended by him to be established , for a specified beneficent purpose , to benefit a certain community , can be used for a purpose widely different from that clearly set forth in the testa - tor 's will and in conversations with his friends .

		Books relating to engineering , chemistry , medical science , and all useful arts , would properly form part of a great library such as the
Crerar Library	ORGANIZATION	was designed to be ; but Mr.
Crerar	PERSON	was strenuously desirous that his library should be composed largely , if not mainly , of books re - lating to religious and moral subjects , the literature and history of all nations , with '' examples that embody truth and prove by events the reasonableness of opinions . ''

		Human life and the formation of character were matters of far more importance , in Mr.
Crerar	PERSON	's judgment , than the history of plants and animals , though incidentally these might be proper objects of interest , but only in a very subordinate degree to the study of human history and of literature .

		It is deplorable that boards of trustees , at their pleas - ure or discretion , can violate the terms of beneficent public trusts .

		The
Crerar Library of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	and the
Lenox Library of New York	LOCATION	are conspicuous instances of such violations ; and the communities most concerned should have the power to prevent such misuse of funds generously bequeathed for specific and wise purposes .

		PROFESSOR
FISKE	PERSON	AND
FRANCIS BACON	PERSON	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Professor
John Fiske	PERSON	, in an interesting article in the
November	DATE	''
Atlantic	LOCATION	, '' opens his discussion of the
Bacon	PERSON	-
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	question with the `` knock-down '' argument that the whole matter is '' the silliest mare 's nest ever devised by human dulness . ''

		But in the zeal of his contest with this `` windmill , '' he goes further , and assails
1897	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 273 Bacon directly , both in regard to his abilities and his services in the cause of science .

		He pronounces Bacon '' one of the most overrated men of modern times , '' deprecates the current opinion that he '' inaugurated a most beneficial revolution in the aims and methods of scientific inquiry , '' and places him '' among intellects of the second order . ''

		He cites
Whewell	PERSON	and Mr.
Jevons	PERSON	as his authorities for this conclusion .

		In my ''
Francis Bacon	PERSON	and his Shakespeare '' -LRB- 1895 -RRB- , the original inquiry , in its deeper significance , broadens out into the vastly more important subject of the develop - ment of the Baconian spirit in Literature and Art .

		In outlining the essential antagonism and the struggle between the Platonic and the Baconian spirit tending also to a clearer comprehension of
Bacon	LOCATION	's services to mankind , I touch upon the point now in question ; and , in defense of
Bacon	LOCATION	, it is perhaps permissible to quote here the following passage , which seems pertinent : '' And finally , he put this Induction to a crucial test , in the discovery of the then unknown nature of Heat , a discovery so true , so far in advance of his age , that it has given rise to one of the profound misconceptions regarding
Bacon	ORGANIZATION	which this generation has inherited .

		Some of us doubtless remember studying in our youth Professor
Comstock	PERSON	's * Natural Philos - ophy , ' where we were taught that ' Heat is an imponderable substance called caloric . '

		And while the scientific world was under the sway of such a philosophy ,
Bacon	PERSON	's conclusion could only be regarded as visionary and preposterous .

		Whewell , in his ` Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences , ' -LSB- 1840 -RSB- , says : '' ' But we can not be surprised , that in attempting to exem - plify the method which he recommended , he should have failed .

		For the method could be exemplified only by some important discovery in physical science ; and great discoveries , even with the most perfect methods , do not come at command .

		... Accordingly ,
Bacon	PERSON	's ' Inquisition into the Nature of Heat , ' which is given in the Second Book of the '
Novum Organum	PERSON	' as an example of the mode of interrogating na - ture , can not be looked upon otherwise than as a complete failure . ' ''

		Devey and
Spedding	PERSON	, editors of
Bacon	LOCATION	's works , take the same view .

		And as late as
1886	DATE	,
Richard A. Proctor	PERSON	, the eminent astronomer , accepting the traditional opinion , in a letter published in the ' Arena ' of
Nov. , 1893	DATE	, speaks of
Bacon	LOCATION	as ' failing egregiously in his attempt on the sole detail to which he applied his own method . ' ''

		But was it an egregious failure ?

		Turning to his '
Novum Organum	PERSON	, ' we find that
Bacon	PERSON	, at the end of his orderly In - duction , arrives at this conclusion : '' ' From a survey of the instances , all and each , the nature of which heat is a particular case , appears to be Motion ... When I say of Motion that it is the genus of which heat is a species , I would be understood to mean , not that heat gener - ates motion or that motion generates heat -LRB- thongh both are true in certain cases -RRB- , but that Heat itself , its essence and quid - dity , is Motion and nothing else ... Heat is an expansive motion , whereby a body strives to dilate and stretch itself to a larger sphere or dimension than it had previously occupied ... that heat is a motion of expansion , not uniformly of the whole body together , but in the smaller parts of it ; and at the same time checked , repelled , and beaten back , so that the body acquires a motion alternative , perpetually quivering , striving and struggling , and irritated by repercussion , whence springs the fury of fire and heat ... Now from this our First Vintage it follows that the Form or true definition of heat -LRB- heat , that is , in relation to the universe , not simply in its relation to man -RRB- is in few words as follows : Heat is a motion , expansive , re - strained , and acting in its strife upon the smaller particles of bodies , 1 -LRB-
Bacon	ORGANIZATION	's italics . -RRB- ''

		Professor
George F. Barker	PERSON	, of the
University of Penn	ORGANIZATION	- sylvania , in his able work on ' Physics , ' recently published , states the present view of the nature of heat in these words : '' ' Heat the
Energy of Molecular Motion	ORGANIZATION	.

		Is heat-energy in the kinetic or in the potential form ?


Davy	PERSON	said in
1812	DATE	: '' The immediate cause of the phenomenon of heat , then , is motion ; and the laws of its communication are precisely the same as the laws of the communication of motion . ''

		This in modern language is equivalent to the statement that heat is kinetic energy ; not evidently of the mass , since the hot body may be at rest ; but of the molecules .

		We know that one of the ways in which a hot body cools is by transferring its energy to another and a colder body not in contact with it ; and we shall study later the mechanism of this radiating pro- cess .

		One thing about it is certain , however , and that is that it consists in a motion of the intervening medium .

		The hot body communicates motion to the medium , and the cold body receives motion from this medium .

		We conclude , therefore , that the surface of a hot body must be in motion ; and because radiation may take place as well from the interior of a body as from its exterior , we also conclude that the body must be in motion throughout its entire mass .

		This view of the case is in entire accord with the kinetic theory of matter already discussed , which supposes the molecules of matter to be actively in motion .

		The motion to which heat - energy is due must therefore be a motion of parts too small to be observed separately ; the motions of different parts at the same instant must be in different directions ; and the motion of any one part must , at least in solid bodies , be such that however fast it moves it never reaches a sensible distance from the point from which it started .

		-LRB-
Maxwell	ORGANIZATION	. -RRB- ' ''

		As we carefully compare the foregoing statements , we can hardly realize that the one is a conclusion put forth
three centuries ago	DATE	, when there were comparatively no science or scientific instruments , and wrought out from the necessarily crude observations of the unaided senses ; and that the other is the expression of the latest conclusion of science , the pro- duct of a century of special research , conducted with the most delicate instruments , and by the brightest men of the time . ''

		In
1874	DATE	, Mr.
W. Stanley Jevons	PERSON	, in the same para - graph from which Professor
Fiske	PERSON	quotes , also wrote : ''
Francis Bacon	PERSON	held that science should be founded on ex - perience , but he mistook the true mode of using experience , and in attempting to apply his method ludicrously failed .

		11 Such was the discriminating power of the writer by whom
Bacon	PERSON	's scientific reputation was '' completely ex - ploded . ''

		Indeed , it is doubtful if Professor
Fiske	PERSON	can cite a single adverse critic who has even suspected that
Bacon	PERSON	's own avowed test of his Induction was other than a '' complete , '' '' egregious '' and '' ludicrous '' failure .

		Limits forbid a discussion of the oft mooted question of the precise range and extent of
Bacon	LOCATION	's services to sci - ence ; but it is apparent , from the foregoing , that his intellectual powers , instead of being '' overrated , '' have , in reality , been appreciably undervalued , and that
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's estimate , which Professor
Fiske	PERSON	quotes almost contemptuously , will yet continue to command our respect .

Nov. 16	DATE	, THE LETTERS OF
ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING	PERSON	.

		* Mr.
Edmund Clarence Stedman	PERSON	, who has just been delighting his readers with his vol - ume of '' Poems now first Collected , '' in his '' Victorian Poets '' speaks of
Elizabeth Barrett Browning	PERSON	as '' the most inspired woman , so far as known , of all who have composed in ancient or modern tongues , or flourished in any land or time . ''

		Further on he quotes the well-known passage in which she gives expression to her feeling about poets and poetry .

		To her , poets were '' The only truth - tellers now left to God ; The only speakers of essential truth , Opposed to relative , comparative , And temporal truths . ''

		The significance of poetry has never received finer expression ; the value of its idealizing tendencies has never been more certainly insisted on .

		The devotion of a lifetime to lit - erature could only be justified by the great good which would thereby accrue to mankind ; otherwise one ran the risk of losing oneself in empty frivolities or vain vagaries or rhetorical insincerities .

		The circumstances of her life emphasized for Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	her deep appre - ciation of the real meaning of a literary career .

		Shut out by long-continued ill-health from the usual communications with the world , she was thrown back upon her own thought and the writ - ten record of the thought of others .

		Shielded as far as possible from every conflict which might do violence to her susceptibilities , she was saved from those depressing defeats which so often lame effort and dull enthusiasm .

		If thus some of her evident faults suffered exag - geration , yet ample room was given for the free development of her powers and the undimmed maintenance of the largeness of the work she felt called to do .

		When , later , she was brought into active connection with men and things , her mind was already matured , her art securely on its way , her determinations fixed .

		We already have the record of some phases of this unique life in poetical form ; for the Letters give renewed assurance to the auto - biographical character of '' Aurora Leigh . ''

		In them , however , the self-revelation has that familiarity which belongs among friends , and it will not be easy to find an autobiography which * THE LETTERS OF

		matches this collection of intimate outpourings of thought and sentiment .

		These are letters , indeed , written under the pressure of the mo - ment , and vital with the need or purpose of the day and hour .

		They cover the entire period of her life from her young womanhood to her latest years , and the editor has left them most judiciously to tell their own tale .

		Mr.
Frederic G. Kenyon	PERSON	has brought to his task qualities which , unfortunately , not all ed - itors possess : a simple style , a profound sym - pathy for his subject , an unerring capacity for discerning where his explanatory introductions and notes and paragraphs are necessary .

		His share of the work deserves the praise and thanks of the reader , and he renews the generous rela - tions in which the Kenyons have always stood to the Brownings .

		One passage from his inter - esting and sensible preface should properly be reproduced here . ''

		The duties of the editor have been mainly those of selection and arrangement .

		With regard to the former task one word is necessary .

		It may be thought that the almost entire absence of bitterness -LRB- except on certain political topics -RRB- , of controversy , of personal ill-feeling of any kind , is due to editorial excisions .

		This is not the case .

		The number of passages that have been removed for fear of hurting the feelings of persons still living is almost infinitesimal ; and in these the cause of offence is always something inherent in the facts recorded , not in the spirit in which they are mentioned .

		No person had less animosity than Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	; it seems as though she could hardly bring herself to speak harshly of anyone . ''

		We have here , therefore , a singularly com - plete reproduction of the life of Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	, made by her own hand , and frequently supple - menting the utterances which we find in her poems .

		We follow her throughout her career , and listen to the comments which she makes upon the events into contact with which her widening and varying experiences bring her .

		The frail recluse is brought from her sick chamber , and it is not long before the whole world reverberates in her thought and words .

		Her interests constantly deepen and enlarge ; the realm of books releases its occupant into the realm of deeds ; the figures , great and small , who cross the scene , are the ones who fashion history as well as literature ; statesmen as well as poets , humanitarians as well as novelists .

		Poetry is seen to be only great when it so touches life that it becomes the voice of large intents and uplifting purposes .

		The early years of Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	's life were spent in the country amid the sights and sounds which are so dear to the poet 's heart .

		They seem to me my native hills ; for , although I was born in the county of
Durham	LOCATION	, I was an infant when I went first into their neighborhood , and lived there until I had passed twenty by several years .

		Beautiful , beautiful hills they are !

		And yet , not for the whole world 's beauty would I stand in the sunshine and the shadow of them any more .

		It would be a mockery , like the taking back of a broken flower to its stalk . ''

		The translation of this passage into elaborate verse may be read in ''
Aurora Leigh	LOCATION	. ''

		She studied Greek assiduously , and read the
Greek Christian Fathers	ORGANIZATION	with the blind scholar ,
Hugh Stuart Boyd	PERSON	, whose friendship she commemo - rates in her poem , '' Wine of Cyprus . ''

		The poems published during this period were purely tentative , and received scant recognition from her in her after years .

		Of her translation of the `` Prometheus , '' published in
1832	DATE	, she says that it was written '' in twelve days and should have been thrown into the fire after - wards the only means of giving it a little warmth . ''

		The translation to be found in her works is a later and more mature version .

		In
1835	DATE	the family moved to
London	LOCATION	, and although the health of the poetess was at first extremely precarious , and the
London	LOCATION	atmos - phere was never favorable to her physical well - being , yet the genuine career of Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	dates from this time .

		Her life-long friendship with Mr.
John Kenyon	PERSON	and
Miss Mitford	PERSON	of 41 Our Village '' and ''
Rienzi	PERSON	'' fame begins ; her poems appear in the magazines , her debut being made with the '' Romaunt of Margaret '' in the `` New Monthly Magazine , '' then edited by Bul - wer
Lytton	LOCATION	; and she is preparing for the pub - lication of her first important volume .

		She is brought into relation with the distinguished men and women of the day .

		Here is her account of her meeting with
Wordsworth	PERSON	: '' No !

		I was not at all disappointed in
Wordsworth	LOCATION	, although perhaps I should not have singled him from the multitude as a great man .

		There is a reserve even in his countenance , which does not lighten as
Landor	ORGANIZATION	's does , whom I saw the same evening .

		His eyes have more meekness than brilliancy ; and in his slow even articulation there is rather the solemnity and calmness of truth itself , than the animation and energy of those who seek for it .

		As to my being quite at my ease when I spoke to him , why , how could you ask such a question ?

		I trembled both in my soul and body . ''

		At length her volume , '' The Seraphim and other Poems , '' appears .

		Its reception did credit to its own merits and the critics who reviewed it .

		The charges of obscurity , mysticism , and affectation were brought against her , and in one of her letters to
Miss Mitford	LOCATION	is found the fol - lowing allusion to them : '' But do n't believe him no !

		do n't believe even Mr.
Kenyon	PERSON	whenever he says that I am perversely obscure .

		Unfortunately obscure , not perversely that is quite a wrong word .

		And the last time he used it to me -LRB- and then , I assure you , another word still worse was with it -RRB- I begged him to confine them for the future to his jesting moods .

		Because , indeed , I am not in the very least degree perverse in this fault of mine , which is my destiny rather than my choice , and comes upon me , I think , just where I would eschew it most .

		So little has perversity to do with its occurrence , that my fear of it makes me sometimes feel quite nervous and thought-tied in composition ... '' During the immediately succeeding years , her creative faculty is greatly stimulated , and some of her noblest poems are produced .

		Her papers on the Greek Christian poets and En - glish poets saw the light in the '' Athena3um . ''

		Then in
1844	DATE	came her two volumes of `` Poems '' and her place among the foremost of living writers was assured .

		Tennyson had already published the best of his earlier poems ;
Brown	PERSON	- ing had issued his '' Bells and Pomegranates '' ; a new generation of poets had fairly won their recognition and right to be heard . ''

		Lady
Geraldine	PERSON	's Courtship '' proved the popular poem in these volumes .

		Of it Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	says : '' Oh , and I think I told you , when giving you the history of ' Lady
Geraldine	PERSON	's Courtship , ' that I wrote the thirteen last pages of it in one day .

		I ought to have said nineteen pages instead .

		But do n't tell anybody ; only keep the circumstance in your mind when you read it and see the faults . ''

		It is now also that the friendship with Mrs.
Jameson	PERSON	commences .

		There is little need of repeating the circum - stances attendant upon the acquaintance of
Robert Browning	PERSON	with the woman who subse - quently took her destiny into her own hands and became his wife .

		The father of Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	could not , it appears , contemplate with equanimity auy separation from his chil - dren , and he objected as strenuously to the later marriages of Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	's sister and brother as he did to her own .

		Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	's health , however , imperatively called for a change of climate , and the journey to
Italy	LOCATION	proceeded , .

		276 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, and the residence in
Florence	LOCATION	began .

		The change for Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	meant everything , release from nunlike seclusion , renewed physi - cal health , incomparable companionship , mix - ture with the great life of the world .

		Her mind and heart take on a more healthful tone ; her mysticism , while never relinquishing its elevation , becomes a deep sympathy with the struggle for liberty which she beholds around her ; her poetry gains in breadth , in simplicity , in humanity .

		In the letters of this time we find the prose version of the '' Sonnets from the Portuguese . ''

		It is five years before the Brownings see
England	LOCATION	again .

		In the meantime
Casa Guidi	ORGANIZATION	becomes a place to which visitors look with eager eyes .

		It was there that the son was born who made a new light in his mother 's eyes .

		The letters are full of accounts of guests from
England	LOCATION	, from
France	LOCATION	, from
America	LOCATION	.

		Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	is drawn to
Margaret Fuller	PERSON	, already the Countess D'Ossoli .

		America and the
Brownings	PERSON	recognized their kinship from the first .

		Powers , Story ,
Ware	LOCATION	,
Hillard	PERSON	,
Harriet Hosmer	PERSON	,
Hawthorne	LOCATION	,
Harriet Beecher Stowe	PERSON	, belong of right to this circle .

		In
1851	DATE	they are back in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Brown	PERSON	- ing 's view of
Louis Napoleon	PERSON	we have in his full-length portrait of '' Prince
Hohenstheil	PERSON	- Schwangau '' ; Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	's we know from her resounding ode , ''
Napoleon III	PERSON	.

		in
Italy	LOCATION	. ''

		The comment of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	in one of his poems may be remembered : '' How shall the spirit be loyal To the shell of a spiritless thing ?

		Erred once in only a word , The sweet great song that we heard Poured npon
Tuscany	LOCATION	, erred , Galling a crowned man royal That was no more than a King . ''

		She had not as yet placed
Napoleon III	PERSON	.

		on the pinnacle to which she afterwards raised him , but she always put a favorable construc - tion upon his actions .

		Thus , she says of the coup d'etat : '' For my own part I have not only more hope in the situation but more faith in the French people than is ordinary among the English , who really try to exceed one another in discoloration and distortion of the cir - cumstances .

		The government was in a dead lock what was to be done ?

		Yes , all parties cried out , ' What was to be done ? '

		and felt that we were waist deep a fortnight ago in a state of crisis .

		In throwing back the sovereignty from a ' representative assembly ' which had virtually ceased to represent , into the hands of the people , I think that
Louis Napoleon	PERSON	did well .

		The talk about ' military despotism ' is absolute non - sense . ''

		Here is an account of her meeting with
George Sand	ORGANIZATION	.

		The account is too long to be given entire , and we have room only for a few sentences . ''

		She received us very kindly , with hand stretched out , which I , with a natural emotion -LRB- I assure you -RRB- , stooped and kissed , when she said quickly , '' Mais non , je ne veux pas , '' and kissed my lips .

		She is large for her height not tall ... There is no sweetness in the face , but great moral as well as intellectual capacities only it never could have been a beautiful face , which a good deal surprised me ... She seemed to be , in fact , the man in that company , and the profound respect with which she was listened to a good deal impressed me . ''

		This is what she says of Carlyle : ''
Carlyle	PERSON	, for instance , I liked infinitely more in his personality than I expected to like him , and I saw a great deal of him , for he travelled with us to
Paris	LOCATION	and spent several evenings with us , we three together .

		He is one of the most interesting men I could imagine even , deeply interesting to me ; and you come to understand perfectly , when you know him , that his bitterness is only melancholy , and his scorn sensibility .

		Highly pictur - esque too he is in conversation .

		The talk of writing men is very seldom as good . ''

		The circle of her life constantly widens and deepens ; the interest in the European ferment intensifies .

		The letters reflect it all : her burn - ing sympathies with those whom she feels to be wronged ; her hopes and aspirations ; her en - larging intimacies .

		All
Europe	LOCATION	is represented :
Lamartine	LOCATION	,
Cavour	LOCATION	,
Mazzini	PERSON	, D'Azeglio , De Musset ,
Kingsley	PERSON	,
Landor	ORGANIZATION	,
George Eliot	PERSON	, Rus - kin , the catalogue can be indefinitely extended .

		As early as the publication of the volume con - taining '' Lady
Geraldine	PERSON	's Courtship '' she had been contemplating the writing of what she called a '' novel in verse . ''

		She considered the '' Courtship '' an effort of that kind .

		At length in the maturity of her powers she accomplished her self-ordained task and gives to the world her '' Aurora Leigh . ''

		With much of that book these letters should be read : the poetry and the prose of her life may be set side by side ; and sometimes the latter exceeds the former .

		The last years added little to the poems pre - viously published .

		The roar of our Civil Con - flict came to her across the waters ; she heard it with dismay , but hoped for the best .

		The frail strand of her life had been growing thinner and thinner ; it parted , and the end came .

		We gave near the beginning of this article a quota - tion from '' Aurora Leigh '' relating to poetry ; we close with another on a kindred theme taken from a letter to Mr.
Chorley	PERSON	: `` Art is not either all beauty or all use , it is essential truth which makes its way through beauty into use . ''

		It was in the light of this conception that the days of
Elizabeth Barrett Browning	PERSON	were passed , and that her work was done .

		FRANCE PREPARING FOR THE REVOLUTION .

		* The most striking fact in the history of
France	LOCATION	in the eighteenth century is the antag - onism that existed between the institutions of the Ancient Regime and new ideas ; although nothing was essentially changed from
1715	DATE	to
1789	DATE	.

		The crown owed its force not to any constitution or contract with the nation , but to the survival of Roman ideas and a long series of encroachments .

		It was absolute in law , though practically hampered by privilege and custom .

		The administrative confusion was prodigious , the administrative organization being derived from three different sources : the feudal epoch , of which a heterogeneous array of institutions remained ; the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries , in which period the great offices were created ; the
seventeenth century	DATE	, which saw the formation of a vast bureau - cracy of ministers and agents .

		These three regimes , instead of succeeding each other , had been superimposed .

		As a result , the system was a complex crisscross of conflicting and concurrent jurisdictions , ecclesiastical , feudal , royal .

		At the head of the government were the councils , dating from the time of Louis XIV. ; the chancellor , the contrbtteur - general , and four secretaries of state , each of whom had charge not only of the special matters of his office but also had general supervision of cer - tain provinces .

		Thus the minister of war con - trolled Dauphine ; the minister of foreign affairs regulated pensions .

		The oldest administrative divisions were those of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		Over these had developed the grand historic provinces like
Burgundy	LOCATION	and
Anjou	LOCATION	, which were divided into two sorts pays d'etat , provinces that retained a measure of local life and pays Selection provinces that were at the mercy of the crown .

		Then there were thirty-eight military govern - ments , besides those of
Lorraine	PERSON	and
Corsica	LOCATION	, and four generalites under intendants ; thirty - four recruiting districts , and numerous judicial districts .

		All this complicated machinery looked *

		By
James Breck Perkins	PERSON	.

		In two volumes .

Houghton , Mifflin & Go	ORGANIZATION	.

		to the central government for its mechanical direction , with the result that local life was stifled .

		The third estate bore almost the whole expense of the government .

		Direct taxes were levied , but the wealthy and noble evaded them .

		The taille , a direct tax , fell upon the masses of the people .

		Both clergy and nobles evaded the capitation tax , which was permanent after
1701	DATE	.

		The most hated indirect tax was that upon salt .

		Certain others , like the corvee , did not involve the privileged classes .

		The system of collec - tion was the old and detestable Roman system of farming the taxes .

		In spite of the great effort at codification during the reign of Louis XIV. , the variety of law was very great .

		The mediaeval distinction between the written or Roman Law and customary law still prevailed .

		The penal code was very rigorous , the procedure complicated and costly ; individual liberty was continually menaced by arbitrary imprison - ment .

		The social inequality , probably inevita - ble with every highly civilized people , in
France	LOCATION	was excessive .

		The privileged classes were the clergy and the nobility .

		The clergy were pos - sessed of immense wealth , and its high repre - sentatives , archbishops and bishops , were veri - table princes in the cloth .

		On the other hand , the lesser clergy , like the country cures , were extremely miserable ; and it is not surprising that the Revolution enjoyed the support of this class .

		The nobles were second only to the clergy in point of wealth , and surpassed them in the possession of sinecures .

		Instead of forming in the centre of the state an enlightened aristocracy like the English nobility , they were completely useless .

		The third estate was practically divided into two classes , the wealthy bourgeois of the cities and the peasant of the fields .

		The former by commerce and industry had raised them - selves to place if not to privilege , in spite of the fact that they had to pay exorbitant taxes and that commerce was impaired by special duties and internal tariffs , and industry was embarrassed by the guild system , an organiza - tion which , while good and useful in the middle age , was in the eighteenth century a positive detriment to free production .

		But the vast mass of the people were far below this more fortunate few .

		The peasants were overwhelmed by taxes of the government , the church , and the noble .

		It was this condition of
France	LOCATION	that led
Michelet	PERSON	to declare that the absolute monarchy of
France	LOCATION	, which supplanted the violence and private war of the feudal epoch , was attended with more injury to humanity than the feudal 278 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, regime itself , but a more modern scholarship has learned to avoid such generalizations and to distrust absolute values in history .

		Mr.
James Breck Perkins	PERSON	's latest work , ''
France	LOCATION	under
Louis XV.	PERSON	, '' is an example of this cau - tious , scholarly spirit .

		Carlyle 's Louis XV. , '' whose whole existence seems one hideous abor - tion and mistake of nature , '' when reduced even to his lowest terms , appears not as an error of nature , but as the product of a wrong civiliza - tion .

		Louis XV .

		was originally a man of easy temperament and naturally good judgment , but he was indolent and weak-willed , a fact that led him to follow the line of least resistance .

		Birth and training made him unable to distin - guish between will and self-will , between the right of his wishes and the privilege of another .

		Indolence made him indifferent to the vice of a highly-wrought and artificial civilization , and created an eager craving for new sensations which led him into depths of vileness that parallelled the declining days of the Roman Empire .

		The end of the reign of Louis XIV .

		seemed the utter prostration of
France	LOCATION	; and yet industry and commerce under his successor experienced a revival .

		The latter , in spite of absurd regula - tions , was prosperous down to the Revolution .

		The peasant , however , remained very miserable .

		The barriers to the free circulation of grain , which Turgot attempted in vain to break down , stifled agriculture and produced famine .

		Never - theless
France	LOCATION	managed to live , and even to improve , in the time of Louis XV .

		Under Fleury , there was actually a surplus of fifteen millions .

		Mr.
Perkins	PERSON	has warm words of praise for Fleury , whose real work for
France	LOCATION	seems to have been lost sight of in the splendor of
Versailles	LOCATION	. ''

		The improved condition of the national finances under
Fleury	ORGANIZATION	had a beneficial effect on business , but the country owed to him a still greater boon .

		The coinage was at last established on an immovable basis , and this measure did more to accelerate the increase of wealth and the development of industry than all the commercial codes at which
Colbert	ORGANIZATION	so earnestly labored .

		For the first time in French history , the country enjoyed during a long period an unchanged standard of value .

		As it had been fixed , so it remained ... By the end of
Fleury	ORGANIZATION	's long administration , the financial principles adopted by him had taken root .

		Business had improved and national income increased ... Freed from the uncertainties which had threatened them , French trade and commerce developed with greater rapidity than at any time in the history of the past . ''

		-LRB- Vol .

		I. , pp. 91-3 . -RRB-

		Just at this point comes in the exceeding value of Mr.
Perkins	PERSON	's work .

		The occasion of the French Revolution , it is admitted , was the great and ever increasing deficit ; but the cause of that increase Mr.
Perkins	PERSON	attributes not so much to the drain of the court , as
Taine	PERSON	would have us believe , but to the enormous treasure expended in unsuccessful war , which ruined the state and diminished its prestige .

		In the two years prior to the war of the Austrian Succession there was an annual surplus of fifteen millions , '' a phenomenon which was not again witnessed under the old regime '' -LRB- p. 91 -RRB- .

		Mr.
Perkins	PERSON	looks at facts with level eyes ; and his judgment of conditions that prevailed in
France	LOCATION	under the old regime , as compared with contemporary history , will arrest attention . ''

		The embarrassed condition of the national finances was not altogether due to excessive expenditure .

		Cer - tainly there was great opportunity for retrenchment , yet the expenses of the government under the old re ` gime were not greater than the country was able to bear ; it is doubtful whether the monarchical establishment was any more costly than the democratic institutions by which it has been succeeded .

		Wars were more frequent in the last century than in this , but while they lasted longer they cost less , and the expense of the army in times of peace was small in comparison with the sums now ex - pended by most European nations .

		Two million livres a year would perhaps represent the sums annually paid in pensions to the aristocracy ... Such extravagance can justly be condemned , yet it is equaled by the salaries of an excessive number of minor officials in the present French government and is far exceeded by the pension list of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		* It may , indeed , be said that the sums thus expended in our own day benefit larger numbers , while those paid out under the old re ` gime profited only a small class ; and yet , considered as a burden on the national wealth , it is questionable if the cost of government absorbed any larger proportion of the resources of the government . ''

		The truth is that the conditions that pre - vailed in
France	LOCATION	in the eighteenth century were not so hard as those in other states of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		How , then , is the revolutionary tendency that was so strong in
France	LOCATION	to be explained ?

		French intellect then led
Europe	LOCATION	.

		In the eighteenth century
France	LOCATION	was the centre of thought .

		But its literature had experienced a change .

		The transition from the classic liter - ature of Louis XIV .

		's time to the philosophic literature of Louis XV .

		's time was fraught with significance for
France	LOCATION	.

		This philosophic thought became especially vital after the junc - tion of the French and English intellects .

		The principles of tolerance and political liberty de - rived from
England	LOCATION	were made known to the French with marvellous clearness by
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	and
Montesquieu	LOCATION	, who were , however , reformers , and not revolutionists like
Rousseau	PERSON	.

		At the same time , the economists demanded liberty for labor and the abolition of the guilds .

		These ideas penetrated all classes .

		THE DIAL 279 up with applause by a society highly wrought , sentimental , and seeking excitement .

		Their seed took root in the breasts of the third estate , where they were nourished by the wrongs under which they suffered , to become at last the symp - toms of a revolution unique in history .

		For the enthusiasm of the reformers was parallelled only by the unpractical character of their teachings .

		Moreover , the bent of thought in the eighteenth century was wholly negative .

		At first directed against the church , about
1750	DATE	its point of attack changed to the state .

		Absolutism was reaping its reward .

		Since the government monopolized all rights , it was held responsible for everything , and every opposition to the government was considered laudable .

		This negative character ultimately penetrated into purely scientific thought as well .

		Condillac deduced pure sensationalism in mental philoso - phy ; Helvetius followed the idea into the moral sphere and denied immortality to the soul and belief in God .

		But Mr.
Perkins	PERSON	has not confined his re - searches entirely to a study of the structure and character of the old regime , but has endeav - ored to unravel the tangled thread of European politics in the eighteenth century .

		The following of that thread , however , is a matter of greater interest to the professional historian than to the casual reader .

		Mr.
Perkins	PERSON	's volumes are the most authoritative attempt yet made to present to English readers the history of the reign of Louis XV .

		and the Pompadour .

		In matter of style , some of the author 's sentences are cameo-like in definiteness and precision .

		Take this sentence , illustrating the distinction between the great and the small nobility : '' The country gentlemen were embarrassed because their receipts were so small , and the great nobles were bankrupt because their expenditures were so large . ''

		And could any antithesis be more pointed than this ? ''

		Louis XIV .

		never abandoned the endeavor to rule his kingdom himself ; but
Louis	LOCATION	XV .

		did not even make the attempt . ''

		No reader agrees with his author in every opinion , and one is inclined to take exception to the statement that '' It neeeded no prophet to discern that institutions which seemed as firmly rooted as those of theMedes and Persians when Louis XIV .

		was proclaimed the Great , were nearing their end when Louis XV .

		lay on his death-bed '' -LRB- Vol .

		I. , p. 1 -RRB- , since even so keen a statesman as
Frederick the Great	PERSON	, who died in
1786	DATE	, did not foresee the Revolution .

		And parenthetically , apropos of the oriental illusion in the quotation above , may we not pro- test against a whole procession of ancient and oriental dynasties ?

		Is there a cumulative force in comparing the French Monarchy to that of the Medes and Persians , the czar of
Russia	LOCATION	, the sultan of
Morocco	LOCATION	, '' Assyrian and Babylonian kings , '' and '' an Assyrian or Egyptian sove - reign , '' all in the space of nine pages ?

		Else - where Mr.
Perkins	PERSON	, in speaking of the fact that the French have never succeeded in giving coincident and due expression to central and local constitutional forces , says of the provincial states prior to '89 : '' They might have furnished a nucleus for the develop - ment of legislative bodies , somewhat akin to the legisla - tures of the American States , but the tendency of politi - cal change in
France	LOCATION	was not in that direction ; in the discussions of the eighteenth century there was little demand for any local subdivision of political action ; the most ardent republican of the Convention was as eager an advocate of centralization as Richelieu or Louis XlV . ''

		-LRB- Vol .

		I. , p. 21 . -RRB-

		The statement is too strong .

		The reform ideas of Turgot looked to the development of local life ; exaggerated local power in the hands of 44,000 communes was one of the defects of the constitution of
1791	DATE	; moreover ,
Brissot	PERSON	, who had been in
America	LOCATION	, and his following in the Girondist party , were French federalists .

		Finally , however , be it said of Mr.
Perkins	PERSON	that few writers could so successfully have avoided the errors and pitfalls for the historian of so complex politics and civilization as that of
France	LOCATION	in the eighteenth century , or carried the work to such successful completion .

		THE SCHOLAR AND THE STATE .

		* One of the most marked features of the pro- gress of the last twenty years has been the socializ - ing of the Christian ministry .

		A generation ago the normal clergyman was not more noticeable by reason of his garb and his phraseology than by reason of his peculiar outlook upon the affairs of the society in which he lived .

		His teaching was theological and doctrinal ; his atmosphere was traditional and conservative ; and his exegesis was largely by way of com - mentary on what had already been said by fathers , reformers , and more recent divines .

		He did not mix himself up with the secu - lar questions of the day , and if he did cast his vote at elections he had at any rate forgotten that his ecclesiastical ancestors a hundred years earlier preached election sermons and shaped affairs of state .

		The present generation has seen this clerical character move into a larger field in two direc - tions .

		On the one hand he has broken some - what with the authority that he once held to be an adequate reason , and with ''
Ian Maclaren	PERSON	'' has harked back to '' the Mind of the Master . ''

		The famous '' Scotch Sermons of 1880 '' showed that he had awakened to his own individuality .

		Dr.
Newman Smyth	PERSON	had the year before re - vealed to him '' Old Faiths in New Lights . ''

		On the other hand , in
1889	DATE	that noblest prelate of the most unprogressive church in
Christen	LOCATION	- dom , Cardinal
Gibbons	PERSON	, had set a grand example in that great work on '' Our
Christian Herit	PERSON	- age '' which breathes not one word of denomi - national teaching , but only the spirit of Christ the Savior of society ; and about the same time his suffragan bishop of our own state Bishop Spalding of
Peoria	LOCATION	had brought together as co-workers for humanity '' Culture and the Higher Life . ''

		The enfranchisement of clerical thought from the too dominant rule of pure dogmatic and polemic was thus begun , and the social duty of the ministry was reemphasized ; and just now we have had along the one line Dr.
Watson	PERSON	's '' Mind of the Master , '' Dr.
Amory H. Brad	PERSON	- ford 's '' The Growing Revelation , '' and Presi - dent
Hyde	PERSON	's '' Social Theology . ''

		In the other line we place the book which is the subject of this review '' The Scholar and the
State	ORGANIZATION	, '' by the Episcopalian bishop of
New York	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
Potter	PERSON	has been a man of affairs , and has shown himself to be imbued with the largest and most generous statesmanship for many years .

		He has done well to collect under one cover these essays and orations of the past ten years , through all of which runs the thought of the responsibility of Christian and educated man - hood to our country and our people .

		A bishop was intended to be '' an overlooker '' for the lives and souls of men ; and the author of these papers has not come short of his calling , either in his life or in his utterances .

		In his essays concerning the scholar and the Christian in his relation to the state , to service , to the criminal , to statesmanship , to American life , the keynote of his thought is insight and illumination rather than knowledge and mere culture as the goal of all acquisition .

		Learning , attainment , accom - plishment , riches , material and mental , are a trust for the society which has made all acqui - sition possible , and which needs its upper classes of mind and of capital as much as it needs its humbler workers .

		In the discussion of '' Christianity and the Criminal , '' '' A Phase of Social Science , '' and `` The Gospel for Wealth , '' Bishop
Potter	PERSON	speaks strong words on the failure of our Christian society to do its duty by the delinquent and de - fective classes , swinging as it does from namby - pamby sentimentalism to unconscious , but none the less pagan , brutality .

		The absurdity , to say nothing of the inhumanity , of our apology for a corrective system is not more severely characterized than is the immorality of our ostrich-like method of obliterating suffering by bribing it to take its countenance away from our doorstep , or the anti-Christian attitude of a civilization that turns its back and shuts its door forever upon a woman who has fallen fallen by the grace of man .

		In `` The Higher Uses of an Exposition , '' published in '' The Forum '' just before the opening of our World 's Fair , a fearless word is spoken for the beneficent and refining and sanctifying influences of art and of all the products of man 's genius , and a solid middle ground is taken between the extremists who would that all others might be made to do as they do on the one hand , and those on the other who would run a wide-open
Sunday	DATE	for the benefit of all the sins of the flesh .

		Along the same line of the educative value of the beautiful is the plea for the symbolism of religion in `` The Significance of the American Cathedral , '' and the protest against that growing conception of the Church as consisting '' mainly of a huge auditorium with a platform and a more or less dramatic performer and a congregational par - lor , and a parish kitchen . ''

		For it is well to recognize '' that religion has never survived anywhere without the due recognition and con - servation of the instinct of worship . ''

		Finally , in the memorial sermon occasioned by the death of
Phillips Brooks	PERSON	, entitled '' The Life-Giving Word , '' is summed up the character of man that must make the life which the Master re - vealed eighteen hundred years ago the basis of modern society . '' ''

		There is a life nobler and diviner than any that we have dreamed of .

		To the poorest and meanest of us , as to the best and most richly dowered , it is alike open .

		NIPPTJR , AXD ITS OLD BRICKS .

		* The large-hearted and benevolent members of the
Archaeological Association of Philadel	ORGANIZATION	- phia have won the gratitude and admiration of the scientific world .

		Their inspiration and offerings have opened the treasure-tombs of
Babylonia	LOCATION	and transferred to the museums of oriental antiquities some of the choicest relics of primitive civilizations .

		Under the auspices of this
Association	ORGANIZATION	, Dr.
Peters	PERSON	organized and prosecuted , in the face of untold difficulties , two campaigns into the heart of old
Babylonia	LOCATION	.

		In
June of 1888	DATE	he set out on his first expedi - tion with a staff of helpers , assyriologists , inter - preter , surveyor , etc. , to search for remains of old Babylonian empires .

		He paints in vivid colors the extreme annoyances and embarrass - ments faced in the organization of the expedi - tion , in the securing of a firman from the Turkish authorities , and after being granted the concession , the continuous and perplexing and treacherous chicanery of the local author - ities in trying to thwart his plans .

		Some months of time were lost in the aggravating delays caused by the Sultan 's too-well-trained officials .

		On
December 1 , 1888	DATE	, about six months after leaving
New York	LOCATION	, the Director left
Constantinople	LOCATION	.

		The members of the ex - pedition soon met , and proceeded , almost as an ancient oriental caravan , across
Syria	LOCATION	to the
Euphrates	LOCATION	, thence down that old stream to
Baghdad	LOCATION	.

		Aside from a few mishaps , the only notable discovery was what the Director calls * NIPPUR , OK EXPLORATIONS AND ADVENTURES ON THE EUPHRATES : The Narrative of the
University of Pennsylvania Expedition	ORGANIZATION	to
Babylonia	LOCATION	in the years 1888-90 .

		.

		From
Baghdad	LOCATION	through devious ways they wend their march to
Nippur	ORGANIZATION	, the site which had been selected for excavation .

		This mound is located about one hundred miles east of south from
Baghdad	LOCATION	, and is adjacent to the bed of the old Shatt-en-Nil canal .

		Only the most refined patience and the best-trained self-control could have endured the contemptible parasitic demands of local officials and their subalterns .

		On
February 1	DATE	, the expedition began to erect a permanent camp on the summit of Nippur .

		About thirty diggers were soon set to work , and these gradually increased , through the de - mand of local sheikhs , to a hundred and fifty .

		Trenches were cut in several places , and work was carried on simultaneously in the different localities .

		There was anything , however , but peace in the camp .

		Bands of wandering Arabs loitered about , begged , stole , and kept the camp in a sort of smoking-volcano condition .

		The antiquities discovered were meagre , some of them of great value for their age , others of slight importance for their modernness .

		Enough had been done to demonstrate that the mound covered old and valuable ruins .

		But the jar - ring and jangling and thieving of the Arabs grew more and more daring and violent , until at 2
A. M.	PERSON	of
Monday , April 15 , 1889	DATE	, the bomb was lighted by a guard shooting a thief .

		This aroused tribe after tribe for blood revenge , until by
Thursday , April 18	DATE	, as the expedition was preparing to retreat , treachery set fire to their camp , and in five minutes it lay in ruins , including three fine horses .

		Many small val - uables , including a bag of gold , had been pur - loined by the omnipresent thieves .

		Only by shrewdness and agility were the members of the expedition able to escape to boats which carried them to
Hillah	LOCATION	, thence to
Baghdad	LOCATION	.

		The Direc - tor at this point says -LRB- p. 288 -RRB- : '' Our first year at Nippur had ended in failure and disaster .

		I had failed to win the confidence of my com - rades .

		None of them agreed with me in my belief in the importance of Nippur , and the desirability of exca - vating down to the foundations .

		The Arabs had proved treacherous .

		The Turkish authorities disbelieved our story of Arab treachery , and suspected us of plotting with our Turkish commissioner to carry away antiqui - ties .

		I was sick and nervous , having suffered for two months almost incessantly from severe facial neuralgia and consequent sleeplessness . ''

		To add another weight to the scale , all the mem - bers of the expedition resigned before
Baghdad	LOCATION	was reached .

		Thus apparently the first cam - paign terminated in a disaster and a catastrophe .

		The second volume describes the campaign 282 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16 , of 1889-90	DATE	, which was conducted with fewer experts , under less difficulties , and with the benefit of the varied experiences of the first year .

		The superstition of the natives was used by the Director to a fine advantage in showing them that their -LRB- the natives ' -RRB- ill fate in the face of the late cholera scourge was due to their ill treatment of the first campaign .

		This secured almost unmolested continuity in carrying on excavations .

		Three-quarters of this volume sets forth the marvellous areha3ological signifi - cance of this campaign .

		Instead of four boxes of antiquities secured in
1889	DATE	, this campaign packed and shipped thirty-six , besides a coffin and a half-dozen door sockets .

		These boxes contained eight to ten thousand inscribed tablets or fragments of tablets , and several hundred inscribed stones and stone fragments , among which were the oldest inscriptions theretofore discovered in
Babylonia	LOCATION	.

		The foundations of what they termed '' the oldest temple in the world '' were laid bare .

		The complete plan and character of this is fully described , and the inscriptions found in and about its walls tell us that it was a powerful institution at about
4000	DATE
B.C.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The bricks of Ur-Gur and Bur-Sin
2800	DATE	B.C. were found in its upper walls .

		The court of columns was another precious archi - tectural find , where they discovered round col - umns resting on square bases .

		Many important inscriptions from the Gossan dynasty of the thirteenth century
B.C.	LOCATION	were brought to light .

		In fact , the entire campaign seems to have been conducted on a shrewd , wise basis , and to have yielded large results for times antedating Abraham by 1,500 to 2,000 years .

		The story is told in a simple , clear , and vivid manner , much of it giving us the day and often the hour of the occurrence of the events .

		The volumes are admirably illustrated with half - tones of the monuments , of mounds , and of personages connected with the campaigns .

		The vividness of delineation is greatly enhanced by detailed plans of the hill
Nippur	PERSON	, and of the foundations which were uncovered .

		Volume I. has a valuable appendix from Dr.
William Hayes Ward	PERSON	's diary of the
Wolfe	PERSON	expedition in
1885	DATE	; and Volume II .

		has another of twelve plates of objects found , which will be of unusual interest to scholars .

		The Director of the expedition is to be con - gratulated on the persistency and pluck with which he has executed his plans , and on the issuance of these beautiful and valuable vol - umes .

		They are gems of the bookmaker 's art .

		THE DIAL 283 a mere narrative of exciting adventure .

		In point of style , both fragments are in the rich manner of the author 's later years , and each of them may be read with lingering delight . ''

		St.
Ives	PERSON	, '' moreover , turns out to be much more of a book than we had expected , for
Stevenson	PERSON	's work does not break off until the three-hundredth page is well passed , and the pattern of the whole so well marked out that one might imagine most of what was left untold , without the friendly offices of Mr.
Quiller-Couch	PERSON	, who has undertaken the delicate task of supplying the closing six chapters .

		The romance is of thrill - ing interest , combining , as it does , the adventures of a French prisoner escaped from the Castle of
Edinburgh	LOCATION	with a highly satisfactory sort of love - story .

		Those who are fanatical in their devotion to
Stevenson	PERSON	's memory will probably resent the in - trusion of an alien hand at the close , but for our part , we must express our gratitude to the distin - guished writer upon whom has devolved the some - what thankless labor of working out the author 's conception .

		Mr.
Quiller-Couch	PERSON	has a very pretty style of his own , and if he indulge at times in a certain extravagance or whimsicality of invention , he has on the whole done his work admirably , and we have no quarrel with him for having failed to attain the impossible .

		One approaches '' The Christian '' with a certain prejudice against it , based partly upon the self - advertising methods of its author , and partly upon the morbid sentimentalism and tawdry rhetoric that are sure to be found in his work .

		It is something of a relief , then , to discover that the book is not nearly as bad as might have been expected , and that its very obvious defects do not deprive it of the power both to interest and to stir its readers .

		This power belongs to the theme quite as much as to the execution , for the professional moralist , whether in orders or not , can always make an effective appeal to his hearers by contrasting the Christianity of the New Testament with the parody that mostly takes its place in modern society .

		Now Mr.
Caine	PERSON	writes primarily as a moralist , and there is no mis - taking the fervor of his conviction that modern society is rotten to the core .

		The unfortunate thing about his performance is that it knows not the virtue of restraint ; that it becomes vehement and even hysterical , and thus half defeats its purpose .

		Think of Dr.
Ibsen 's Brand	ORGANIZATION	, from which all such figures as Mr.
Caine	PERSON	's Christian derive , and the difference between art and journeyman-work becomes apparent enough .

		And then Mr.
Caine	PERSON	's hero is only a Brand manqu6 , which makes another big difference .

		But in spite of his vacillation , he interests us , and we follow his tempestuous career with a certain amount of sympathy , although not as much as the author would evidently have us accord the subject .

		To run amuck through society , as
John Storm	ORGANIZATION	sees fit to do , is not likely to result in reforming the world , and the way of
Erasmus	ORGANIZATION	is usually better than the way of Luther .

		As for
Glory	ORGANIZATION	, the heroine , she would be a nice girl if she had another name , and could have cultivated a less affected style of letter-writing .

		Books in the new-old fashion of romantic histor - ical fiction are so much of a piece that when we have stated the period and the chief historical char - acters with which such a work is concerned there seems little or nothing more to say , as the machinery and the trappings may easily be left for granted .

		Mr.
S. Levett Yeats	PERSON	, in '' The Chevalier d'Auriac , '' writes of the last stand of the
League	ORGANIZATION	, of
Henry of Navarre	ORGANIZATION	, and the
Duke of Sully	ORGANIZATION	.

		He has a love story of the approved conventional type , a series of desperate adventures and escapes , and the usual swaggering hero .

		In the authorship of such a ro - mance there is hardly a trace of individuality .

		It is all done to pattern , and the name on the titlepage might be that of Mr.
Weyman	PERSON	, or Dr.
Doyle	PERSON	, just about as well as the name that we actually find there . ''

		The Fall of a Star '' is the story of a crime , of the criminal 's ingenious efforts for concealment , and of the clever way in which it is brought home to him by a couple of amateur detectives .

		The hero is a very wicked villain indeed , who is also a rising English statesman , the hope of a great party .

		He is both a
Jekyll	ORGANIZATION	and a
Hyde	LOCATION	, although the two char - acters are blended -LRB- except in one scene -RRB- instead of being sharply differentiated .

		The story is not ex - actly brilliant , although not without entertaining qualities and reasonably exciting chapters .

		`` In the Days of Drake '' is a short historical novel by Mr.
J. S. Fletcher	PERSON	, who has done good work in this field before , and who has a very pleas - ant way of telling his tales .

		The hero is an English lad , kidnapped by a Spaniard , taken to
Mexico	LOCATION	, and given into the tender hands of the Inquisition .

		He is condemned to the galleys , and lives in a floating hell until rescued by an English ship , which proves to be no other than that in which
Drake	ORGANIZATION	is making the first circumnavigation of the globe .

		Thus our youth becomes a part of that glorious emprise , and when he returns to the home that had long mourned him for dead , soon sets matters to right , both with his sweetheart and with the villain who had sought to compass his destruction . ''

		His Majesty 's Greatest Subject '' is a historical romance of the future instead of the past .

		It pre - tends to be the story , revealed after his death , of the man who , early in the twentieth century , saves a revolted British
India	LOCATION	to the Empire .

		He does it by taking the place and character of his twin - brother the Viceroy -LRB- who has died suddenly -RRB- , cut - ting off cable communication with the rest of the world , and then proceeding to suppress the revolt in his own way , at the same time pacifying the na - tives by a series of administrative reforms .

		The story has a real lesson for the English statesman , the lesson that Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	has done so much to emphasize .

		It is that the government of
India	LOCATION	should be left to deal with its own problems in its own way , unhampered by cabinets and parliament - ary commissions .

		And the merit of the book lies in the force with which this message is conveyed , and the evident wide acquaintance of the author 284 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, with Indian affairs .

		The book is hardly literature in the most catholic sense of that term , and the puerilities of its sentimental passages are such as to excite the derision of even the uncritical .

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	has appeared to much better advan - tage of late in his shorter stories than in his more pretentious novels .

		There is so much sameness in his minutely photographic descriptions of our con - temporary society , that , in spite of their shrewd humor and sure sympathy , they become wearisome after the first hundred pages or so .

		But an '' idyl '' having the dimensions of '' An Open - Eyed Conspi - racy , '' which may be read at one short sitting , affords the pleasantest of entertainment , and , despite the fact that even when treated within such limits the material for the sketch seems scanty , the reader is on the whole well rewarded for his attention .

		This story of
Saratoga	LOCATION	is a very pretty piece of work , and we are glad that it has been added to the author 's studies of commonplace humanity .

		Mr.
Bret Harte	PERSON	's new novel does not offer any - thing strikingly new either in character or incident .

		He has often entertained us with stories of `` strikes '' in mining-camps , and frontier ruffians of various types , and belles of the village developed into fine -LRB- and faithless -RRB- ladies .


Jack Hamlin	PERSON	, too , is nearly always with us in Mr.
Harte	PERSON	's pages , and we are seldom deprived of some striking contrast between the early privations and the later opulence of the principal characters .

		All these cliches , and others equally familiar , reappear in the '' form '' of '' Three Partners , '' and we find them all welcome and of perennial interest .

		The plot of this novel is exceed - ingly complicated , and the reader grows breathless in his attempt to keep up with the development of the narrative ; but the author must be accepted upon his own terms , and , with all his obvious faults , he remains as fascinating as of old .

		Mr.
Samuel Harden Church	PERSON	, the author of a popular biography of
Cromwell	LOCATION	, has essayed to bring his hero into a work of fiction , and has produced a very readable historical romance of the invasion of
Ireland	LOCATION	by the Parliamentary army in
1649	DATE	.

		The incidents are all of the stereotyped sort ; the hero falls in love with a fair enemy , achieves the difficult task of protecting her without failing in his duty to the Parliamentary cause , wins her love and is duly united to her in wedlock , suffers disgrace in the eyes of his General and regains favor by an act of bravery , finally passing through the wars un - scathed and settling down to his hardly won happi - ness .

		We have read it all many times before , and expect to read it many times again with the same unflagging interest .

		The author is a staunch be - liever in
Cromwell	LOCATION	, and stoutly defends the Irish campaign and the horrors of
Drogheda	LOCATION	as justified by the circumstances of the war .

		He is clearly in full sympathy with his hero when he represents him as speaking in these terms : '' Men are already call - ing this campaign the
Curse of Cromwell	ORGANIZATION	.

		We shall have much abuse on that score .

		The day may come when academic statesmen in
England	LOCATION	will refer to this policy as a blunder and a crime .

		But the Lord commanded His captains of old to smite His enemies and to slay whole nations ; and verily now , even now ,
Jehovah	ORGANIZATION	hath directed our progress to the castigation of this people , that they may be re - claimed from their errors and their fair land res - cued from its disorders . ''

		The theme of '' The Stand-By '' is a fine one , but the author has elected to treat of it in a spirit which goes far to repel sympathy .

		That the law should be both respected and enforced , and that even a bad law demands no less consideration than a good law , are general propositions to which every candid and intelligent mind must assent .

		But when , as in the case of the present novel , an attempt is made to enlist our sympathies in behalf of the sanctity of law , it is surely a wanton sacrifice of effectiveness to make the conflict between law and lawlessness centre about a piece of legislation that is offensive to all healthy political and social instincts .

		What Mr.
Dole	PERSON	has really done in this novel is to merge his defence of a great principle into a mere brief for the prohibitionist , and our admiration for the fine fighting qualities of his hero has all the time to contend with a feeling that he might have found a far worthier employment for his energies than to enlist them on the side of the fanaticism that usually characterizes what are oddly enough known as `` temperance '' movements .

		The narrow attitude of the author , in spite of his show of fairness in argumentation , is revealed when we find him de - fending , not only the enforcement of a bad law -LRB- in which his position is impregnable -RRB- , but also the retention of the law upon the statute-book .

		We believe firmly in what the surprised
New Yorkers	LOCATION	of a year or two ago learned to call '' Eooseveltism , '' but we believe also that the true mission of ''
Roose	PERSON	- veltism '' is to open men 's eyes to the ill-advised and reckless character of a great deal of our meddle - some law-making .

		The fabrication of a novel has come to be a very easy task for Mr.
Marion Crawford	PERSON	.

		By long years of practice at the art , he has provided himself with a collection of puppets , characteristically labelled and costumed , and standing in orderly array upon the shelves of his private cabinet .

		To produce a new book , all that he has to do is to make a judicious selection from these figures , touch them up a little , perhaps hastily shaping two or three others of the same general sort , and arrange the group in some pleasing new combination .

		The result is such a book as ''
Corleone	PERSON	, '' now before us , or any of the other books that are sure to follow as long as the industry of the craftsman and the patience of his public hold out .

		We have always thought Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	's '' Saracinesca '' books the best of his entire output , for , while their characters may hardly be called creations , they are faithful studies of an interesting series of types , and , what is more to the point , of types which no one before Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	has presented with so much skill , sympathy , and inventive resource .

		The hero of this new book is a
1897	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL Saracinesca , the oldest son of Corona and
Sant	ORGANIZATION	' Ilario , and its theme is the story of his love for a Sicilian girl , who is supposed , until the very end of the novel , to have come from the Corleone stock '' the worst blood in all
Italy	LOCATION	, '' as we are told with somewhat wearisome iteration .

		It is all the time difficult to believe that so pure-souled a heroine should have sprung from so corrupt a race , although water-lilies do blossom upon the bosom of the swamp , and we learn with much relief that she had been stolen in infancy , and that her real family is above reproach .

		The story is surprisingly interesting in its main episodes , and even the hackneyed tale of the priest accused of murder , and unable to defend himself because the confessional seals his lips , is treated in a fashion at once fresh and dramatic .

		Finally , if one would know the real meaning of the sinister word mafia , we can not do better than refer him to this book by a writer who knows the Sicilian character as intimately as if to the manner born .

		The surprising versatility of Mr.
Paul Leicester Ford	PERSON	is once more illustrated by his '' Story of an Untold Love , '' which surely has nothing about it to suggest his story of '' The Great K. and A. Eob - bery '' or his learned edition of '' The New England Primer , '' and little to suggest '' The Honorable
Peter Stirling	PERSON	. ''

		It proves to be a very charming and delicate piece of fiction , in the form of a diary pri - vately kept by the hero , and triumphing so com - pletely over the difficulties inherent in that form that its choice is amply justified .

		We can not , how - ever , accept as a probability the central situation of the book , for it is impossible to believe that the heroine , who had known her lover so intimately in childhood , could have failed to recognize him when their intercourse was renewed later in life .

		But without this assumption , the story could not have existed , so we must be content to take the exception , and think no more about it .

		A more serious prob - lem is offered by the conduct of the hero in lending his literary talents to his employer , and thereby deceiving his friends and the public .

		The fact that this is done for the praiseworthy purpose of obtaining money for the payment of a debt of honor makes the question one of a delicate casuistry , but we can not hold the hero quite blameless .

		Nothing remains to be said except that the diary in which these things are set forth falls by accident into the hands of the heroine , and that the untold love is thus all told at last , receiving its due reward .

		Several novels dealing with the history of the colonial and revolutionary periods have recently been published , affording a pleasant indication that our writers of fiction are becoming more and more cognizant of the fact that they need not leave home in search of effective themes .

		While these books -LRB- with a single exception -RRB- are not remarkable , they provide agreeable reading , and should not go un - mentioned in such a summary as the present .

		Colonel
H. E. Gordon	PERSON	's ''
Pontiac	LOCATION	, Chief of the Ottawas , '' is a tale of the siege of
Detroit	LOCATION	by that famous leader in the year
1763	DATE	.

		It is a story of the sort that
Cooper	PERSON	loved to tell , and has all the incidents and characters the scout , the captive maiden , the ambush , and the rescue that so appealed to our youth .

		While a story of a somewhat amateurish sort , it is not without both interest and excitement .

		Miss
Augusta Campbell Watson	ORGANIZATION	's '' Beyond the City Gates '' has also something of the amateurish quality , although the writer has set her name to several earlier books .

		It is a romance of
New York	LOCATION	in the
last days of the seventeenth century	DATE	, when the English government had just replaced the Dutch , and Captain
Kidd	PERSON	was the terror of the worthy burghers .

		The redoubtable pirate , although he does not make a personal appearance in these pages , has a good deal of indirect influence upon the plot , which concerns a pretty Dutch maiden and her two lovers the one a dissolute associate of buccaneers and cutthroats , the other a worthy young giant of sober mercantile pursuits .

		The story is a pretty one , and virtue properly triumphs in the end , although the heroine has some dark hours before the clouds roll away from her life . ''

		A Soldier of
Manhattan	LOCATION	'' is a romance of the war which ended in the capture of
Quebec	LOCATION	and the triumph of
England	LOCATION	in the
New World	LOCATION	.

		Its chief excellence is in its depiction of the feelings of rivalry between the colonial and British forces , a rivalry which , although it did not prevent them from fight - ing side by side in opposition to the common enemy , foreshadowed clearly enough the time when they should be arrayed against one another .

		This par - ticular aspect of the temper of the time seems to be presented more clearly than we have hitherto viewed it in the romantic fiction dealing with the period in question .

		The book is full of exciting adventure , tolerably good fighting , and fairly acceptable ro - mantic sentiment .

		But the author has not risen to the occasion offered by the memorable exploit of
Wolfe	PERSON	, and his description of that epochal engage - ment is tame in comparison with what other writers notably Mr.
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	have made out of it . ''

		In Buff and Blue '' is a story of the Revolu - tionary War , and calls for no further comment than the statement that it tells pleasantly enough , but with slight spirit or vividness of description , the familiar story of the operations about
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		The usual love story is interwoven with the tale of battle , and a happy conclusion is in due time reached . ''

		A
Colonial Free Lance	ORGANIZATION	'' is a far better book than any of the historical novels thus far discussed , and in reading it we feel for the first time that the trick of such writers as Mr.
Stanley Weyman	PERSON	and their congeners has been successfully caught , and its application transferred to the field of American history .

		Here are indeed a spirited style -LRB- although far from perfect -RRB- , a variety of invention , a rapidity of movement , and a general brilliancy of execution that hold the reader from beginning to end , and give him to the American revolutionary struggle the same sort of romantic interest that attaches to the story of the English Commonwealth or the Napoleonic wars .

		A work of larger dimensions , both material and 286 -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, moral , is offered us in Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	's ''
Hugh Wynne	PERSON	, Free Quaker , '' which we are inclined to think the most important novel of the
American Revolution	ORGANIZATION	thus far written , and which adds a bright spray to the author 's already considerable collection of lau - rels .

		Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	's literary work always commands respect , and this particular work may claim a con - siderable measure of admiration as well .

		The hero of the book is a young
Philadelphia	LOCATION	!!

		of
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	family , carried away by the hot temper of the time from the restraints imposed by his training , and finding in active service for his country a finer ideal than could be provided by the tradition of non - resistance .

		He becomes estranged from his father , achieves for himself an honorable career as a soldier , and wins the woman of his love .

		The historical material imbedded in this romance embraces all the important happenings from the Stamp Act to
York	LOCATION	- town and the treaty of peace , and is handled in a way that evinces both sound scholarship and the artistic instinct .

		Perhaps the finest thing in the book is the characterization of the hero 's father a
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	of stern and almost fanatical type , and a creation of the most unquestionable vigor and vi - tality .

		Although the narrative is without exciting effects , and never even verges upon the sensational , it is possessed of absorbing interest , and will always have an honorable place in American fiction .

		The familiar statement that history repeats itself is well illustrated by the author of '' Captain
Shays	PERSON	, '' a novel of the '' critical period '' of our history .

		In styling the leader of
Shays	PERSON	's Rebellion '' a populist of
1786	DATE	, '' Mr.
Rivers	PERSON	has emphasized the fact that social discontent is much the same thing in one age as in another , and that the demagogue uses in about the same way the opportunity offered him by a pe - riod of '' hard times . ''

		As he remarks , '' the spirit of
Daniel Shays	PERSON	still lives in the hearts of some of those leaders who are showing the farmers the wrong path , and who have nothing in view but their own selfish ends . ''

		Last in this group of historical novels comes '' A Loyal Traitor , '' which is a sea story of the War of
1812	DATE	.

		The surprising adventures of the hero will appeal to boys of all ages , and , if our credulity is sometimes taxed overmuch , we are hardly allowed to realize the fact , so swiftly does the narrative move from excitement to excitement .

		The element of fem - inine interest is lacking , although the author works in a commonplace young woman upon two or three occasions , and pretends that she is the heroine .

		This is merely a concession to a conventional demand , and must not be taken seriously .

		The book would be no whit less interesting were the fair
Mary	PERSON	left entirely out of its pages .

		The author can tell a capital story of naval adventure , but there is no sentiment in him , and he bungles the love-story sadly .

		A group of novels by
Chicago	LOCATION	writers calls for a few words of comment , perhaps the most noticeable thing about these books being the fact that no one of them is concerned with the city with which its author is identified .

		Mr.
Opie	PERSON	Read takes us to
Mississippi	LOCATION	for a scene and Mr.
Chatfield-Taylor	PERSON	to
Washington	LOCATION	, while Mr.
Larned	PERSON	is satisfied with nothing less remote than the
Pyrenees	LOCATION	, and Mr.
Horton	PERSON	bids his readers set sail for '' the isles of
Greece	LOCATION	. ''

		Mr.
Read	PERSON	's '' Bolanyo '' is the story of an actor , landed in a
Mississippi	LOCATION	town as the result of an explosion in a river steamer , cared for by the leading politician of those parts , persuaded to under - take the management of a local playhouse , and nearly lynched as the result of an unfortunate mis - understanding .

		The real interest of the book is supplied by neither the hero nor the story of his love for Senator Talcom 's married daughter , but rather by the picturesque figure of the Senator him - self , who is a distinct type , delineated with consider - able skill .

		In spite of a certain stiffness of dialogue and a lack of the finer graces of literary art , the story is an entertaining one , and exhibits construc - tive talent in a marked degree .

		Pride , according to Pope and Mr.
Chatfield-Tay	PERSON	- lor , is '' The Vice of Fools '' which pointed a moral for the former and provided the latter with a title .

		Mr.
Chatfield-Taylor	PERSON	has been cultivating the epi - gram more assiduously than ever , and his novel fairly bristles with the shafts of wit and wisdom that go to make up the preternaturally clever con - versation of his characters .

		The thing is neatly done , but it does not seem altogether worth doing .

		Strip the book of these verbal trappings , and nothing worth considering remains .

		The author has here - tofore shown some ability to deal effectively with life , yet he now gives us nothing but the chatter of a few puppets , and would have it pass for a picture of
Washington	LOCATION	society .

		Even so impossible a volte - face as is executed by his General
Lloyd	PERSON	in the closing chapters does not arouse a protest , for there is nothing real about the
General	ORGANIZATION	anyway except his clothes and his manners or about any other figure in the book .

		And all the while the nerves are being rasped by an endless string of epigrams that make one long for relief in the form of some display of genuine human feeling .

		Mr.
Larned	PERSON	, in his '' Arnaud 's Masterpiece , '' can hardly be credited with a hold upon life , any more than can the author of the book just before men - tioned , but he gives us at least tender sentiment and the vision of beauty in nature and in art .

		His charming tale is of the simplest in theme and dic - tion .

		It has caught something of the spirit of me - diaeval romance , and suggests to the reader , now the story of Aucassin and his love , now the wonder - imaginings of
William Morris	PERSON	.

		While the author has not succeeded altogether in excluding modern modes of feeling from his work , he has nevertheless woven a web of delicate and graceful fancy about his painter-hero and the two maidens whose fates are entangled with his own .

		Mr.
George Horton	PERSON	, although he has been serving his country in the Athenian consulate for several years past , may be reckoned a Chicagoan , and his '' Constantino '' given a place in this section of our review .

		The book gives us some interesting bits of
1897	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 287 description , and a considerable quantity of quaint Greek ceremonial and folk-lore .

		Incidentally , it tells a moderately interesting story of the reign of
King Otho	PERSON	, a story not very well constructed , but saved by its pretty style and somewhat novel ma - terial .

		The tragic outcome rather jars upon the reader in view of the cheerful tenor of what has gone before , although fair warning of what may be expected is provided in the opening chapter .

		The young writers of the hour who affect '' style '' and write story after story without having anything worth relating would probably dismiss with a very superior sort of sneer such a collection of tales as ''
Susan	PERSON	's Escort and Others , '' recently brought to - gether from various periodicals by Dr.
Edward Everett Hale	PERSON	.

		But the larger-minded critics who , while appreciative of the virtue of literary form , think a story none the worse for displaying some inventive skill , or for reflecting a wholesome and genial personality , will not be disposed to scorn the entertainment offered by such a volume as this .

		There are nearly a score of pieces altogether , some based upon very slender conceits , others elaborating a more substantial idea , and all attractive in more ways than one .

		Their homeliness makes no demand upon high-wrought emotions , and their whimsicality keeps the reader alert for the fresh surprises that await him at every turn .

		We are frequently re - minded of the odd fancies of Mr.
Stockton	PERSON	, but with the difference that the matter-of-fact manner is here not assumed as a literary device , but is rather the most natural form of the author 's expression .

		Colonel
Johnston	PERSON	's new volume , '' Old Times in
Middle Georgia	LOCATION	, '' is a collection of a dozen or more tales and sketches of life in the
State	ORGANIZATION	which he knows so well , and of the bygone period of which he retains so mellow yet vivid a memory .

		It is a phase of life which we should hardly know at all if it were not for this writer 's happy and genial tran - scriptions from the book of his recollections .

		The stories are largely in dialect , but it is both accurate and inevitable , and our old quarrel with dialect writing does not extend to such a case as this .

		Colonel
Johnston	PERSON	is facile princeps among the story - tellers who have kept alive in literature the memory of the old South ; his sketches have a tenderness of sentiment and a persuasive charm that bring his books close to our affections , for there somehow shines through them the light of a gracious and large - hearted personality , and reading them we learn to know the writer almost as well as we do the people who inhabit the old time world that he restores for us .

		The name of
M. Jules Claretie	PERSON	is one that does not suggest the writer of fiction , yet the brilliant ritic and playwright has recently made two ventures in the field of romance , and both of them have found English translators . ''

		The Crime of the Boulevard '' might , indeed , have found a better one , for the version in which it is offered to the English-reading public is very slovenly , the work of a person who has neither accurate knowledge nor the least sense of style .

		The book is a detective novel of considerable ingenuity , although its denouement is made to result from an utterly impossible occurrence the retention of a photographic image upon the retina of a dead man 's eye .

		The detective methods by which the murderer is tracked and trapped differ from those of
Sherlock Holmes	PERSON	and
Monsieur Lecocq	PERSON	in their reliance upon what we may call psychological indi - cations , the start of the guilty person at the artfully contrived speech , the unconscious admission made in the unguarded moment .

		The book has a vein of senti - ment which relieves the grewsomeness of its theme , and brings it into touch with ordinary human life .

		The sentimental element is even more marked in '' Brichanteau , Actor , ''
M. Claretie	PERSON	's other book , which has the good fortune to be translated into graceful and idiomatic English .

		We may hardly call it a novel , for it tells no connected narrative , but is rather an autobiographical series of episodes in the life of a professional comedian .

		If delinea - tion of character be the chief test of excellence in a work of fiction , this book must be given a high rank .

		The character of Brichanteau is thoroughly genuine , in its drawing so shaded as to bring out the most delicate nuance ; he compels both our admiration as an artistic creation and our affection as a fellow - creature .


M. Sarcey	PERSON	, in a cordial introduction to the volume , describes its hero as '' the actor en - amoured of his art , but who , for one reason or another , has not achieved success ... a failure without melancholy or envy , an optimist failure .

		... Brichanteau is charming because he is always treading the boards , because he believes in good faith that his life is a drama in which he plays the principal part . ''

		M. Claretie has described with delightful irony this ridiculous side of the character of his hero , '' who wears in ordinary life the nod - ding plumes of the stage . ''

		We need say no more to show that
Brichanteau	PERSON	is a charming companion , and that
M. Claretie	PERSON	's book is a human document of the most genial and enjoyable kind .

MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Ma sand ^ r *
Townsend MacCoun	PERSON	, as author sketches of the and publisher of `` The Holy Land Holy Land .

		j n Geography and History , '' has ren - dered a lasting service to teachers in the
Sunday	DATE	School as well as to students of Palestinian history .

		In these two handy little volumes , which may be slipped within the pocket , he has given the results of three years ' labor .

		The first volume contains over fifty geological and topographical maps a superb presentation of the physical characteristics of the land , based upon the researches of the Pales - tine Exploration Fund .

		These are accompanied by a descriptive text .

		The second volume contains some sixty general historical maps , and upwards of thirty plans of towns and environs .

		This volume gives an excellent sketch of Palestinian history from the earliest days to the close of the Crusades in the 288 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16 , thirteenth century	DATE	.

		While the author in this sketch has assumed the integrity of the Biblical account as against the school of destructive criticism , he has availed himself of the whole literature of his sub - ject , from
Ewald	LOCATION	to
Edersheim	LOCATION	,
Graetz	PERSON	to
Hilprecht	PERSON	and
Fetrie	PERSON	, and has made a most satisfactory sum - mary .

		The large collection of maps is an admir - able feature , in which every device of the engraver and the colorist has been employed to enable the student to realize the land of the
Bible	LOCATION	.

		A few points are open to criticism .

		It would have been better , in citing the authorities , to give volume and page .

		In two of the maps Nos. 59 and 94
Alexandria	LOCATION	and
Persepolis	LOCATION	are allowed to appear long before they were founded .

		In all other cases modern names and places are italicized , or else are distinguished by different coloring .

		The map of the beginning of the fifth century should divide
Phoe	PERSON	- nicia into
Maritima	LOCATION	and Libanensis , as is done on the map following ; and
Syria	LOCATION	in both maps should be divided into
Prima	LOCATION	and
Secunda	LOCATION	.

		On the first of these maps Scythopolis -LRB- not Scythapolis -RRB- is placed too far from the
Jordan	PERSON	.

		Schtirer is frequently spelled without the umlaut mark ; and we note in one case
Lenormand	PERSON	for Lenormant .

		These are , however , but small flaws in a work so generally commendable .

		New guesses at Jt *** Goethe who said , All my the meaning of writings are fragments of a great Shakespeare , confession , '' and the critics , as a rule , have assumed the same thing of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, espe - cially of his Sonnets .

		But so great has been the divergence of opinion with respect to the nature of this confession that the controversy gathering about them has become one of the most voluminous in all literature .

		The latest addition is by Mr.
Edwin James Dunning	PERSON	in '' The Genesis of Shakespeare 's Art '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- ; and it must be granted that he has made a new furrow in this much - ploughed field .

		Mr.
Dunning	PERSON	believes the Sonnets to be autobiographical , but in a less material sense than is commonly supposed .

		The supreme expres - sions of devoted love in the first series are not ad - dressed to
William Herbert	PERSON	or any other , but refer symbolically to his own Muse or guiding genius ; his admonitions to the youth to marry express the poet 's desire to spur his own fancy to invention .

		In the series expressing his jealousy of others , especially of some rival poet , he confesses his early dependence upon models , his imitation of the '' fine filed phrase '' of earlier poets .

		The '' dark lady '' is not
Mary Fitton	PERSON	or any other person in the flesh , but under this figure
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	records his own struggles between idealistic art , false in its very perfectness , toward a more realistic art , ugly of aspect but in - wardly alluring .

		Thus , in Mr.
Dunning	PERSON	's opinion , the Sonnets as a whole are the outpouring of Shakes - peare 's art-consciousness , and the record of his growth in finish , understanding and power as an artist .

		This is something quite new in the aesthetic interpretation of these poems , and makes of them a A decisive battle of the Civil War .

		self-revealing sequence in a more exalted sense than any previous critic has suggested .

		It will not , of course , appeal with equal force to all readers ; many have already come to conclusions too fixed for change ; yet every new theory tends to increase the never - abated interest of three hundred years in these wonderful poems of '' infinite variety , '' charm , and mystery .

		General
Jacob D. Cox	PERSON	, once com - mander of the twenty-third army corps , has already given proof of his ability as a military historian in his two books for the '' Campaigns of the Civil War '' series , on '' The Campaign of
Atlanta	LOCATION	'' and '' The
March	DATE	to the Sea , '' published some fifteen years ago .

		He has now taken up his pen again to give a more detailed account of a portion of the subject of his second work in a new book entitled '' The Battle of Franklin '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		He says , in his justification , that '' when a battle proves to be a turning-point in a decisive campaign , when it marks the beginning of the end in such a contest as our Civil War , when it justifies the strategy of such a leader as
Sherman	PERSON	in his division of his forces in
Georgia	LOCATION	and making the
March	DATE	to the Sea , when in addition to this the combat may be fairly said to be a crucial experiment in the prob - lem of attack and defence of fieldworks in an open country , we can hardly place a limit to the desira - bility of detailed knowledge . ''

		The author has had the advantage of the completed publication of the `` Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies , '' and it is the completion of this great record which has induced General Cox to tell again the oft - told tale of the battle of Franklin .

		His work is a valuable contribution to our military history , and the narrative is told in a style that combines the knowl - edge of the warrior with the skill of the literary artist .

		The value of the book is enhanced by several maps from the official records .

		The work is thor - oughly well done , and will hardly require to be done again , despite the little controversy as to leadership between Generals Cox and
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	, which is a side - issue .

		To see one 's people yield before the invader ; to see one 's ancestral cus - toms supplanted by those of the hated conqueror ; to see one 's religion replaced by a for - eign creed , these things are hard to bear .

		Yet these things have been borne all through our own land , through
Mexico	LOCATION	, and through
Central America	LOCATION	.

		The native populations have been reduced , their whole mode of life has been changed , their religions have been replaced .

		Few of the stories of these changes have been preserved ; all would be of thrill - ing , though sad , interest .

		Sometimes the Indian turned , in a vain effort to resist the new-comer .

		The story of one of these fruitless resistances is told in dramatic form , by Dr.
D. G. Brinton	PERSON	, in the little book entitled '' Maria Candelaria '' -LRB-
David McKay	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The Tzentals lived in
Chiapas	LOCATION	, now the southern - most state of
Mexico	LOCATION	.

		In culture they were the

		THE DIAL 289 equals of almost any people in the Isthmian region .

		Reduced by the Spaniards in
1523	DATE	or
1524	DATE	, they revolted in
1528	DATE	, but were quickly resubjugated .

		They remained under Spanish control quietly until
1712	DATE	, when a stroke for freedom was made under the leadership of an Indian girl
Maria Candelaria	ORGANIZATION	.

		An attempt was made to restore the old government , revive the ancient customs , and rethrone the ances - tral religion .

		For a time everything seemed to be in her favor ; but troubles arose , misunderstandings and treachery appeared , and the cause was lost .

		It is the closing scenes in this insurrection that Dr.
Brinton	PERSON	dramatises .

		His book is at once interesting and a study , which reveals Indian thought and life with considerable probable accuracy .

		A pretty book which anticipates the ^ ^ Y * < on '' that on Ely Ca - thedral , '' by the
Dean of Ely	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- im - ported by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons -RRB- .

		One of the most beautiful of English minsters is here chronicled by one who is able to speak with author - ity , and full justice is done to the matchless octagon tower , and its noble artist
Alan de Walsingham	PERSON	.

		Here are most interesting details as to the construc - tion of this famous octagon .

		Wonderful oak timber Old England produced in the fourteenth century !

		The angle posts are each 53 feet long and 3 feet 4 inches by 2 feet 8 inches in their other dimensions .

		Alan took much trouble to find trees sufficiently large and sound , '' searching far and wide , and with the greatest difficulty finding them at last , paying a great price for them , and by land and sea trans - porting them to
Ely	PERSON	. ''

		While the book is in sub - stance made up of two '' Extension '' lectures deliv - ered by the Dean , and is therefore popular in treat - ment , lovers of old
Ely	ORGANIZATION	and its shrine will here find much to stir their recollection pleasantly , and the scholar may find in the appended notes valuable contributions on '' Liber Elieusis '' and the monas - tery rolls .

		_ Two charming volumes fresh from the
Hamilton Gibson	PERSON	's < * TT T ^ i farewell volumes .

		P ress of
Messrs. Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	bear the name of
William Hamilton Gibson	PERSON	.

		They are a parting gift from a hand stilled in death ; and it is with a sense of personal bereave - ment one turns over their fascinating pages .

		Facing the title-page of '' Eye Spy , '' a portrait of the author is presented in a characteristic attitude , gazing in - tently into the heart of a flower to read some ex - quisite mystery folded away from the view of the casual observer .

		In '' My Studio Neighbors '' he is seen again in the secluded spot where he painted his pictures and wrote his pen-sketches , or found inspiration for both in the myriad phases of ani - mate or inanimate nature surrounding him .

		It is , perhaps , our farewell interview with one who never failed to delight and instruct with his ingenious and picturesque portrayal of the wonders he discovered in the structure and behavior of bird and insect and their near allies in the floral world .

		Both volumes are made up of short papers , each an interesting and valuable story illustrated with drawings of deli - cate beauty .

		The instinct of the poet and the sin - cere feeling of the nature-student are apparent in every bit of work that bore the signature of this lamented author .

		The nature-lover ' * `` Nature 's Diary '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , com - caiendar and piled by Mr.
Francis H. Allen	PERSON	, will attract the eye by its tasteful exterior .

		It is done up in green , the cover and the smooth - cut edges of the leaves wearing the pleasing tints of earth 's drapery in the
summer	DATE	season .

		The right - hand pages of the volume are left vacant for notes by the reader ; those on the left contain extracts arranged in the order of a calendar , one or two for each day in the year .

		All speak of some aspect of nature , chiefly of the landscape in the varying sea - sons .

		Nearly three hundred of the selections are from
Thoreau	LOCATION	; the remainder are taken from a dozen well-known authors .

		A sameness results from this narrow range , which detracts from the interest of the compilation .

		Thoreau has written upon nature with fervor and beauty ; but many others have equalled or surpassed him in imagery and diction , as , for example , Mrs.
Celia Thaxter	PERSON	and Col.
T. W. Higginson	PERSON	, both of whom the compiler has wholly left out of his account .

		Popular lecture * Mr -
Bertram C. A. Windle	PERSON	's handy on English little book entitled '' Life in Early archeology .

		Britain '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , covering in a popular way the whole field of English Archaeology , has grown out of a series of familiar lectures .

		The style is attractive throughout ; the material and its treatment are variable .

		Some chapters are capital , others are poor .

		The worst is that dealing with the
Palaeolithic Period	ORGANIZATION	, in which the subject is poorly presented and the British material sadly neglected .

		The work deserves on the whole high praise .

		It will be a great help to the traveller .

		A brief out - line history of the succession of peoples on
Britain	LOCATION	's soil such as this is will render much that is seen in museums comprehensible and interesting .

		Not the least valuable part of the book is an appendix wherein is a list of places , geographically arranged , where British antiquities may be studied either in the field or in museums .

New York	LOCATION	for the purpose of studying the '' Mapple Sugar '' industry as an investment .

		Back of the material interest was the philanthropic motive of competing with the slave labor of the sugar - producing South .

		Although the venture was not successful , and Mr.
Lincklaen	PERSON	soon assumed the surer remuneration attaching to the agency of the
Holland Land Company	ORGANIZATION	, he left a legacy to all pos - terity in the '' Journals '' which he kept of his jour - neys in the backwoods .

		While devoid of political 290 THE DIAL -LSB-

		They are brought out by Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons , with accompanying notes and maps , thus constituting a real addition to the library of the student of early

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Mr.
John Morley	PERSON	's Rede lecture on ''
Machiavelli	ORGANIZATION	, '' published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	in a thin volume , revives the old regret that the author should have found so lit - tle time of recent years for literary production .

		Were it not for politics , we might have had a long series of just such essays as this graceful , ripe , scholarly pro- ductions and English literature would have been so much the richer .

		How happy was the writer 's choice of a subject in the present instance is shown by the amount of discussion that has been provoked by the essay .

		Most of our modern statesmen have gone to
Machiavelli	ORGANIZATION	's school , and some of them have bettered the instruction ; nothing could well be more timely , then , than an analysis of the Machiavellian theory of government , made by a man who has himself for many years been in the thick of modern political life .

		`` The Yersin Phono-Rhythmic Method of French Pronunciation , Accent , and Diction '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- is the work of two young women , Miles .

		M. and
J. Yersin	PERSON	, who have had much practical experience as teachers of the French language , and who have now sought to im - part -LRB- as far as it is possible for the printed page to do so -RRB- the method by which they instruct their pupils in French phonetics .

		The work is eminently practical , and is provided with a very sensible introduction .

C. F. Kroeh	PERSON	's '' Three - Year Preparatory Course in French '' -LRB-

		The purchaser of the booklet is supposed to detach the cheques and send them to his friends , recording upon the stubs the names of the victims of his impertinence .

Twentieth Century Club	ORGANIZATION	on the

		Bulwer-Lytton 's `` The Last Days of
Pompeii	LOCATION	'' and Lever 's ''
Charles O'Malley	PERSON	'' have been issued in the '' Illustrated English Library , '' of which Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons are the American importers .

		In regard to illustrations , mechanical make-up , and cheapness of price , this series compares favorably with any other line of reprints of standard fiction now on the market .

		Recently published text-books in science include the following works : '' Practical Electrics '' -LRB- Spon and
Chamberlain	PERSON	-RRB- , '' a universal handy-book of everyday electrical matters , '' now in its fifth edition ; `` Popular Readings in Science '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- by Messrs.

Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons , is now about half completed , the latest addition being `` Dom - bey and Son '' in two volumes .

		The illustrations and elegant typography , together with Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's prefaces , should make this edition the standard one for the library .

		The
Alumni Association of Franklin	ORGANIZATION	and
Marshall College	ORGANIZATION	have begun the publication of an '' Obituary Record '' for that century-old institution .

		The first number , a volume of nearly two hundred and fifty pages , brings the record up to the present year , and hereafter annual supplements are promised .

		One may become a life subscriber to this publication for the sum of two dollars . ''

		The Students '
American History	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
D. H. Montgomery	PERSON	-LRB-
Ginn	PERSON	-RRB- , is a more extensive work than the author 's '' Leading Facts of
American History	ORGANIZATION	, '' and designed for students of somewhat maturer growth .

		It is an admirable text-book , the product of wide ex - perience in both teaching and writing , amply illustrated with the right sort of material , supplied with helps for further study , and altogether deserving of the highest commendation .

		Messrs.
Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers of the following text-books : `` The Study of Mediaeval History by the Library Method for High Schools , '' by Mr.
M. S. Get	PERSON	- chell ; '' Exercises in Greek Composition , '' based on
Xenophon	PERSON	, by Mr.
Edwin H. Higley	PERSON	; `` Maldon and Brunnanburh , '' edited by Dr.

		Mr.
John Osborne Austin	PERSON	, of
Providence	LOCATION	, has com - piled a ''
Roger Williams	PERSON	Calendar , '' in the form of a substantial volume of 366 pages .

		Each day of the year has a pithy extract from the great apostle of liberty of conscience , and a satisfactory index is added .

		It will be news to many that
Roger Williams	PERSON	now and then dropped into poetry , and the following is one of several curious examples : '' If nature 's sons , both wild and tame , Humane and courteous be , How ill becomes it sons of God To want humanity . ''

		Precisely what the Stanhope Essay is , or how it originated , we do not at present remember ; but that essay for
1897	DATE	is furnished by Mr.
John Buchan	PERSON	, Exhib - itioner of
Brasenose College	ORGANIZATION	, and its subject is Sir Wal - ter Ralegh .

		It is published in
Oxford	LOCATION	-LRB-
R. H. Blackwell	PERSON	-RRB- in a duodecimo of seventy-eight pages .

		It is not a bio - graphy , but , as its name implies , an essay ; and it seeks to sketch Sir
Walter	PERSON	's character '' roughly and crudely ; to trace the war of motives which at all times beset him ; to find , in short , in his temper and talents some explanation of the cruel circumstances of his fate . ''

		And it does all this in a manner with which the reader can find no fault .

RODEN	PERSON	'S CORNER And is located for the most part in
The Hague	LOCATION	, but has also picturesque and noteworthy glimpses of

England	LOCATION	and
Holland	LOCATION	.

		PRINCIPLES OF VOCAL EXPRESSION AND MENTAL TECHNIQUE AND LITERARY INTERPRETATION .

		By
W. B. CHAMBERLAIN	PERSON	,
A.M.	LOCATION	, of the
Chicago Theological Seminary	ORGANIZATION	; and
S. H. CLARK	PERSON	, Ph.B. , of the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	.

		The principles of vocal expression lie not in any mechanical rules , but in the last analysis in the thoughts and feelings of the speaker .

		Whoever would understand the philosophy of expression and the rules which govern it , must , therefore , first learn how to think and feel with the author whom he would interpret .

		The speaker must KNOW the mind and heart of the writer in order to give vocal expression to his literary creations ; and must be so far master of the art of expression as to make his own thoughts and feelings most forceful to another .

		This theory has produced the new book on the methods or principles of expression by Professors
Chamberlain	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	.

		The authors do not claim that they are in everything original , but they believe that they have suggested certain principles of study and certain methods of practice for public speakers and readers , which have not heretofore been stated in the form here given them .

		34T A PHILISTINE WATCHWORD .

		Readers of '' The International Journal of Ethics '' must have rubbed their eyes when they received the last number of that earnest and valuable review , and found its first score of pages devoted to the great achievement of Dr.
Nansen	PERSON	in Arctic exploration .

		What has such a matter to do with ethics ?

		they may well have asked , and why should our attention be diverted to the deeds of this hardy
Norseman	ORGANIZATION	when all our intellectual energies are needed for the examination of such engaging subjects as '' the relation of pessimism to ultimate philosophy , '' and '' our social and ethical solidarity , '' and '' the history and spirit of Chinese ethics , '' to instance a few of the themes discussed within the same covers .

		The fact that Mr.
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	was responsible for this diversion gave promise , indeed , of a high degree of intellectual entertainment ; but one had to get well along into the essay before discovering what Dr.
Nansen	PERSON	was really doing in this galley .

		The name of the writer was , of course , sufficient to warrant the conclusion that the choice of sub - ject would prove to be justified , even for the purposes of a '' journal of ethics '' ; and the event showed that some of the deepest matters underlying the general problem of conduct might be involved in the story of the explorer and the stanch ship that drifted with the 324 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, northern ice-cap across the circumpolar seas .

		There is , to put it bluntly , no ethical prob - lem of greater importance than that which emerges from the consideration of just such activities as were so magnificently displayed by the expedition of Dr.
Nansen	PERSON	.

		It is the fundamental problem of utilitarianism , and the most searching analysis is needed before we can hope to straighten it out .

		Into all discus - sions of this problem the philistine shibboleth of the `` practical '' forces its way , and puts such questions as these : '' Is it not wrong to admire men whose fine qualities run more or less to waste ; or , if that can not be said , that might have been applied to some purpose of more importance to the welfare of mankind ?

		To admire simplicity , daring , vigor , and good com - radeship , is of course right ; but ought we not , it may be asked , to regret all the more their devotion of these virtues to inadequate ends ? ''

		Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	finds no difficulty in answer - ing these questions to the confutation of their philistine proponent . ''

		You admit , '' he says to the short-sighted utilitarian who can see nothing beyond the immediate consequences of a given display of effort , '' you admit in some sense that the main end of conduct should be to promote the greatest happiness of the great - est number ; and yet the precepts which you deduce from your principles seem to imply a colorless monotony and a life uncheered by any pursuits enjoyable in themselves . ''

		Grouping the work of Arctic expeditions with other sci - entific work , and with art and literature , as con - stituting all together a sort of `` play , '' he says : '' The justification for play , if we may call that play which involves most strenuous labor , must take a different ground .

		One ground is that the energy which has had no directly utilitarian aim has been of most essential service to man - kind ; that , if the world has improved even in the sense of being able to support a larger popu - lation in moderate comfort , the improvement has been owing not simply nor perhaps chiefly to those who have consciously labored to redress grievances and remove causes of misery , but to men who have pursued intellectual aims , scien - tific or artistic , for the pure love of art or science . ''

		And he concludes by saying that '' the true doctrine seems to be that it is an imperative duty for a man to devote his intel - lect to those purposes , whatever they may be , to which it is most fitted . ''

		The spokesmen of the '' practical '' have done so much in all ages , and are still doing so much , to chill enthusiasms and to narrow the scope of life , that we make no apology for recurring to this well-worn theme , and pointing out once more the essential misconception of those well-intentioned but purblind persons . ''

		Why was this waste of the ointment made ? ''

		is a question that we hear repeated , in vari - ous disguises , every day of our lives .

		Now there are two satisfactory answers to the ques - tion in all of its forms : one of them faces the utilitarian critic upon his own plane and leaves him no ground upon which to stand , while the other makes the radical demand that he broaden his conception of utility and rearrange his no - tions of conduct in accordance with a far finer envisagement of the purpose of human life .

		The first answer is the one more commonly made .

		Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	, for example , makes it in these words : '' Knowledge can scarcely be ad - vanced in any direction without throwing light upon knowledge in general ; and the devotion of some men of great powers to minute and apparently remote interests is really to be ad - mired because it constantly leads to unforeseen and important results . ''

		The history of science is so filled with illustrations of this truth that we hardly know where to begin in making a selection .

		Take almost any of the achieve - ments of applied science and trace the under - lying ideas back to their genesis in the brain of some devoted investigator , or , reversing the process , take from the annals of the history of science any idea that has proved fertile and show what extremely practical results have grown out of it , and , in whichever way we construct the genealogy of our chosen idea , we shall be filled with wonder at its consequences , and made to realize that such consequences must , in the very nature of things , be largely or wholly unforeseen when the idea first springs to birth .

		How useless , to all seeming , were the early studies of micro-organisms , and yet these studies laid the foundation for the vast benefactions of Pasteur and made a reality of the long-cherished dream of a rational theory of disease .

		Or how could Oersted , or the most keen-sighted of his contemporaries , have fore - seen that his discovery of the deflection of the magnetic needle by the galvanic current was to make possible all the countless applications of electricity to our modern life ?

		In view of such facts as these , how childish it is to ask of every new contribution to knowledge that it at once justify its existence by doing something for man 's material comfort , and how benighted must be his mental condition who scorns every new scientific truth that may not at once be put
1897	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 326 to some practical use .

		And , to return to the immediate theme of this discourse , the man stands intellectually self-condemned who is rash enough to assert that the deep-sea soundings or the magnetic and meteorological observations made by the
Nansen	PERSON	expedition may not in the future prove to have furnished a necessary link in the chain of reasoning whereby some vast new gift shall be bestowed by science upon human life .

		Strong as appears , however , the argument above outlined , and amply sufficient as it is to answer the cui bono ?

		of the philistine critic , we are not content to rest upon it the case for science .

		For there always underlies the dis - cussion of this subject a source of misunder - standing that is rarely probed .

		The respective champions of science and of utilitarianism may be using the same words , but they are not speak - ing the same language .

		In employing the terms which they bandy about so freely such terms , for example , as use , '' '' benefit , '' and practical value '' they are nearly always playing at < 3ross-purposes , and the one seldom understands what the other really means .

		Why is one thing more practical than another ?

		The only possible answer is that it contributes more directly to the satisfaction of some desire .

		But how great is the arrogance of those who single out certain desires of a sort relating almost wholly to matters of material comfort , and assume that those desires alone are worthy of being gratified at the cost of any effort .

		Is a desire to be scorned because it does not happen to be entertained by the majority of unthinking people , and is the quality of a desire to count for nothing in this calculus of ethical values ?

		And if we take quality into the reckoning , does not the advancement of knowledge minister to the best of all desires ?

		The search after truth is an end in itself , and nothing can be more practical , in any sense of the term worth con - sidering , than the prosecution of that high quest .

		To think God 's thoughts seemed to
Kepler	PERSON	a worthy employment for his best in - tellectual energies , and '' To follow knowledge like a sinking star Beyond the utmost bound of human thought , '' seemed to the master-singer of our own age the noblest of all aims .

		It is by just the extent to which man is capable of entertaining such ideal ambitions that he is lifted above the beast of the fields , and the humanity is in pitiable case that can scorn any sincere effort to strengthen the foundations of the temple of human knowl - edge or bear its dome still further skyward .

		THE ANXALS OF A FAMOUS PUBLISHING HOUSE .

		* Mrs.
Oliphant	PERSON	's delightful book , The An - nals of a Publishing House '' -LRB- a posthumous book , alas -RRB- , embodies a favorite scheme of the late
John Blackwood	PERSON	, a son of the founder of the famous
Edinburgh	LOCATION	house , so long and hon - orably known to the world of letters .

		It had been the intention of Mr.
Blackwood	PERSON	, as we learn in his nephew 's prefatory note , to utilize the firm 's copious records in the preparation of a work that should serve as a memorial of his father and brothers , and as a history of the firm and the magazine that
William Blackwood	PERSON	founded , and which should at the same time furnish some account of the brilliant band of writers whom the energy , discrimination , and very genuine love of letters of the first Black - wood , as we may venture to style him , rallied to his support .


John Blackwood	PERSON	died without setting his scheme on foot .

		But his idea bore fruit in a subsequent proposal to Mrs.
Oli	PERSON	- phant to carry out his project and to become the historian of the firm in whose service she was an honored veteran .

		Mrs.
Oliphant	PERSON	ac - cepted the trust with the ready zeal of a loyal retainer , but with the pathetic prescience that the projected work was destined to mark the termination of her long and strenuous literary career .

		This prevision , as we know , proved true , and in a sense even overtrue , two volumes of the intended three being all that this gifted and amiable writer lived to complete .

		It is grateful to add that these valedictory volumes betray no symptom of flagging powers or cool - ing sympathies , no abatement of that even and ample flow of thought characteristic of the writer .

		All in all , we have had no more de - lightful book from Mrs.
Oliphant	PERSON	than this , her last .

		It was clearly , with her , something of a labor of love to render justice to the ster - ling character of the founder of the house with which her own relations had been so cordial , and she found a congenial theme in the humors of the somewhat Shandean circle of writers who aided the rise , spread the fame , and too often sorely taxed the purse and patience , of kind and sensible
William Blackwood	PERSON	.

Oliphant	PERSON	.

New York	LOCATION	: Imported by
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		326 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	,
Maginn	PERSON	, Gait , and so on , her opening volume is largely devoted .

		In beginning her history of the house of
Blackwood	LOCATION	, Mrs.
Oliphant	PERSON	spares the grateful reader the usual Scotch '' ell of genealogy . ''

		For us ,
William Blackwood	PERSON	is large enough to stand as first of his line and father of his own for - tunes , though doubtless with him , as with most
Scotchmen	PERSON	, research would disclose an '' ancestor '' or so , were it only some sixpenny laird of a kailyard or notable
Highland	LOCATION	cattle - thief .

		It was in
1804	DATE	that this first
Blackwood	LOCATION	, after a fourteen years ' novitiate at
Edinburgh	LOCATION	,
Glasgow	LOCATION	, and
London	LOCATION	, returned finally to Edin - burgh and '' set up for himself '' as bookseller and possible publisher on the South Bridge .

		The business throve apace .

		In
1811	DATE	was formed the important connection with
John Murray	PERSON	of
London	LOCATION	, who threw over the
Ballan	PERSON	- tynes on their failure to offer him a share in the publication of '' The Lady of the Lake . ''

		Mr.
Blackwood	PERSON	's first notably successful publi - cation was Dr.
McCrie	PERSON	's '' Life of
John Knox	PERSON	. ''

		In
1816	DATE	he secured , through
Ballantyne	PERSON	and jointly with
Murray	PERSON	,
Scott	PERSON	's `` Tales of My Landlord . ''

		The squabble -LRB- if we may call it so -RRB- which marked this transaction , and which perhaps led up eventually to
Scott	PERSON	's ill-starred return to Constable , has been variously stated .

		Mrs.
Oliphant	PERSON	tries to show that
Murray	PERSON	, more than
Blackwood	PERSON	, was at fault ; but it is pretty plain that the latter , too , '' put his foot in it . ''

		It seems that after long negotiations with the agent of the still unknown author of `` Waver - ley , '' the first instalment of the '' Tales '' was submitted to the publishers .

		Murray showed the manuscript to
Gifford	ORGANIZATION	, who sagely suggested some '' improvements '' which were approved by Mr.
Blackwood	PERSON	, who in his turn forwarded the suggestions and strictures through
Ballantyne	PERSON	to the author .

		Scott , stung at the presumption of the trio of wiseacres , flamed into wrath , and wrote to Ballautyne in the vein of one of his own moss-troopers : `` Dear James : I have received
Blackwood	PERSON	's impu - dent letter .

		G d his soul !

		Tell him and his coadjutor that I belong to the Black Hussars of Litera - ture , who neither give nor receive criticism .

		I '11 be cursed but this is the most impudent proposal that ever was made . ''

		Plausible
James	PERSON	, more suo , sent a sugared ver - sion of this robust missive to
Blackwood	LOCATION	; but the offense was given , as the sequel seems to show ; and it only remained for the chagrined men of business to settle the balance of account - ability between them .

		Probably they joined forces in rating the sagacious Gifford .

		At this period ,
Edinburgh	LOCATION	was at the zenith of its fame as a mart and centre of letters .

		The blaze of more than one great reputation gilded the haze of `` auld Reekie '' with sunrise splen - dors ; and the conditions in the publishing world were such as to greatly invite and stimulate lit - erary activity .

		The marvellous success of the books of
Scott	PERSON	and
Byron	PERSON	disclosed a new El - dorado ; and the dazzled publisher , south as well as north of Tweed , was delightfully pre - disposed to see in each strange young gentle - man who came to him with a manuscript in his pocket a possible rival of those popular bards .

		Speculation was rife ; and a strange spirit of equity , even liberality , warmed the hearts and loosened the purse-strings of the Bacons and Bungays of the trade .

		Authorship , even of the Grub Street sort , suddenly lifted its head , and claimed kindred with the liberal professions .

		The days when Otways and Chattertons starved in garrets , and scholarly Boyces were reduced in winter to composing in bed , with the pen hand thrust through a slit in the blankets , were gone indeed .

		Manuscripts from obscure sources were usually acknowledged courteously , and even deferentially ; and when rejected , it was in terms that carried balm to the soul of the sender .

		Beautiful day , when the haughtiest publisher recognized between himself and the humblest brother of the craft by which he too lived , the bond of a common humanity !

		As for the prices paid , they were sometimes simply fabu - lous .

		Lord
Cockburn	PERSON	says of Constable '' the crafty '' Constable : '' Abandoning the old timid and grudging system , he stood out as the general patron and payer of all promis - ing publications , and confounded not only his rivals in trade but his very authors by his unheard of pieces .

		Ten , even twenty guineas a sheet for a review ,
2000	DATE	or 3000 for a single poem , and
1000	DATE	for two philo - sophical dissertations , drew authors out of their dens , and made
Edinburgh	LOCATION	a literary market famous with strangers , and the pride of its own citizens . ''

		The fate of this open-handed publisher the world knows ; but such was not always the re - ward of the more prodigal members of the trade .

		Some of them -LRB- we rejoice to know -RRB- perversely grew rich , in spite of
Adam Smith	PERSON	and the penny-wisdom of their faint-hearted competitors .

		Murray too , for instance , was a publisher in the grand style , as the following letter shows : '' Lord
Byron	PERSON	is a curious man .

		He gave me , as I told you , the copyright of his two new poems , to be printed only in his works .

		I was so delighted with it that even as I read it I sent him a draught for
1000	DATE	guineas ... But he returned the draught , saying it was very liberal much more than they were worth ;
1897	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 327 that I was perfectly welcome to both poems to print in his -LRB- collected -RRB- works without cost or expectation , but that he did not think them equal to what they ought to be .

		I went yesterday , and he was rallying me upon my folly in offering so much , that he dared to say I thought now I had a most lucky escape .

		To prove how much I think so , my lord , ' said I , do me the favor to accept this pocket-book ' in which I had brought with me my draught changed into two bank-notes of
1000	DATE	and 50 ; but he would not take it . ''

		Could anything be finer or more magnanimous than that ?

		The publisher 's almost pathetic anxiety to part with his money ; the author 's firm , though playful , refusal to take it ; the resolution of each not to be outdone by the other in indifference to pelf ; the fine Castilian flavor of the whole transaction .

		Shade of Ja - cob Tonson !

		Nor was
William Blackwood	PERSON	a whit behind his regal
London	LOCATION	correspondent as a patron of letters .

		His reply , in
1817	DATE	, to an unknown writer who had timidly sent him a specimen , is a magnificent thing .

		Let the reader note that in it Mr.
Blackwood	PERSON	lauds to the skies a production which he clearly in - tended to buy actually puffs it in advance , to his own manifest loss and diminution of profit .

		Could there possibly be a more undiplomatic , a more hopelessly unbusinesslike , letter than this ?

		`` Mr.
Blackwood	PERSON	now returns to the author the en - closed manuscript , which he has perused oftener than once with the highest delight .

		He feels not a little proud that such a writer should express a wish to re - ceive any suggestion from him .

		The whole construction and execution of the work appear to him so admirable that it would almost be presumption in anyone to offer corrections to such a writer ... Mr.
B.	PERSON	will not allow himself to think for one moment that there can be any uncertainty as to the work being completed .

		Not to mention his own deep disappointment , Mr.
B.	PERSON	would almost consider it a crime if a work possessing so much interest and instruction were not given to the world . ''

		The unknown writer proved to be Miss
Susan Ferrier	PERSON	, and the book under discussion her suc - cessful novel , '' Marriage , '' issued by Black - wood in
1818	DATE	.

		It need not be inferred , however , that so shrewd a judge of what he dealt in as was
William Blackwood	PERSON	could not say '' no '' to the literary aspirant whose wares were not to his taste .

		He does not seem to have troubled himself to say even that much to poor Bran - well
Bronte	PERSON	, whose frantic appeals to his judg - ment , and even his mercy , would be ridiculous enough were they not so grimly pathetic .

		Per - haps he thought the petitioner crazy .

		In one letter the poor fellow -LRB- `` who aspired to admis - sion to the staff of '' Maga '' -RRB- declares that the idea of writing for any other periodical is '' horribly repulsive '' to him .

		He goes on to say to a publisher who , it seems , had never even replied to his effusions : `` My resolution is to devote my ability to you ; and for God 's sake , till you see whether or not I can serve you , do not coldly refuse my aid .

		All , sir , that I de - sire of you is : that in answer to this letter you would request a specimen or specimens of my writing , and I even wish that you would name the subject on which you would wish me to write .

		... I know that I am not one of the wretched writers of the day ... Now , sir , do not act like a commonplace person , but like a man willing to examine for himself .

		Do not turn from the native truth of my letters , but prove me ; and if I do not stand the proof I will not further press myself on you .

		If I do stand it why you have lost an able writer in
James Hogg	PERSON	, and God grant you may get
PATRICK BRANWELL BRONTE	PERSON	. ''

		one 111 That this appeal also elicited no reply appears from the fact that there is a letter dated four months later , endorsed , in very large printed characters , ' * SIR , READ NOW AT LAST . ''

		It en - closed a poem -LRB- entitled `` Misery , Scene 1st '' ! -RRB-

		and ends with : '' I send it because it is soon read and comes from the heart .

		If it goes to yours , print it , and write to me on the subject of contribution .

		Then I will send prose .

		But if what I now send is worthless , what I have said has only been conceit and folly .

		Yet CON - DEMN NOT UNHEARD . ''

		The last letter quoted from this writer begs for an interview , and hints temptingly at some - thing -LRB- in the prose way -RRB- in the writer 's pos - session , '' the design of which , whatever might be its execution , would be superior to that of any series of articles which has yet appeared in '
Blackwood	PERSON	's Magazine . ' ' ''

		Now , sir , '' concludes this unhappy foil of his brilliant sisters , '' is the trouble of writing a single line to outweigh the certainty of doing good to a fellow-creature and the possibility of doing good to yourself ?

		Is it pride which actuates you or custom or prejudice ?

		Be a Man , sir ! ''

		etc. , etc. .

		Poor Bran well !

		no leaf of the
Bronte	PERSON	laurels grew for him .

		The crowning achievement of
William Black	PERSON	- wood 's earlier career was , of course , the starting of ''
Blackwood	PERSON	's Magazine . ''

		Of this event , as of the corps of clever scribblers -LRB- we had al - most said scamps -RRB- who rallied to ''
Maga	PERSON	'' and gleefully proceeded to run amuck at all Edin - burgh and half
London	LOCATION	, Mrs.
Oliphant	PERSON	gives a lively account .

		The initial '' Blackwood '' scored a tremendous success .

		Why ?

		Chiefly , so far as we can perceive , by reason of its scurrillity .

		We rejoice to think that a publisher who should father such a thing nowadays would be a lost man .

		We would no more tolerate him than we would tolerate Theodore Hook that precious '' wit '' who used to pour melted butter 328 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, into people 's coat-pockets , and distribute medi - cated sweets at evening parties .

		But tastes and standards were otherwise in Mr.
Black	PERSON	- wood 's days ; and ''
Auld Reekie	PERSON	'' rose to the new magazine with joyful plaudits .

		Mingled ominously , however , with the roar of Homeric laughter came a deepening wail of angry dis - content from the victims .

		Those who were hardest hit or thinnest skinned talked of the law ; and presently writs and threats of writs fell in at the Princes Street office like leaves in
Vallombrosa	LOCATION	.


Wilson	PERSON	and
Lockhart	PERSON	fled to the lakes ; and the owner of '' Ebony '' stayed to brave the storm .

		The most generally offend - ing -LRB- though not the most offensive -RRB- paper in the magazine was of course the '' Chaldee Manuscript . ''

		Everybody has heard of this jeu d * esprit ; few of our own day have read it .

		Those who do read it will marvel at the tempest it raised in the
Edinburgh	LOCATION	teapot .

		Compared with the airy raillery of a moquer of genius like
Heine	PERSON	, it seems a rather Boeotian perform - ance a piece of literary horse - play that old
Burton	PERSON	might have relished as he relished the banter of the Oxford bargees .

		Briefly de - scribed , it was a local satire , bristling with thinly-veiled personalities , some of them merely playful , others malicious enough , and couched in Biblical language .

		Mrs.
Oliphant	PERSON	furnishes some specimens of it -LRB- presumably favorable ones -RRB- , one of which , an elegant '' drive '' at Sir
John G. Dalyell	PERSON	, we subjoin : '' Now the other beast -LSB- Sir
John	PERSON	-RSB- was a beast that he -LSB- Constable -RSB- loved not : a beast of burden which he had in his courts to hew wood and to draw water and to do all manner of unclean things .

		His face was like unto the face of an ape , and he chattered continually , and his nether parts were uncomely .

		Nevertheless his thighs were hairy , and the hair was as the shining of a satin raiment , and he skipped with the branch of a tree in his hand , and he chewed a snail between his teeth .

		... If thou lookest upon him and observest his ways , behold he was born of his mother before the months were ful - filled , and the substance of a living thing is not in him , and his horns are like the potsherd which is broken against any tree . ''

		But we must now take leave of Mrs.
Oli	PERSON	- phant 's sprightly book one of the best , we repeat , that she has given us .

		The second vol - ume deals largely with celebrities of a some - what later date than that of those we have men - tioned , and whets the appetite for a third and final volume , from another hand , which Mr.
William Blackwood	PERSON	in his prefatory note en - courages us to look for .

		The work is hand - somely printed by Messrs.
William Blackwood	PERSON	& Sons , and contains portraits of the successive chiefs of that sterling house .

		A GLIMPSE OF PURITAN NEW ENGLAND .

		* If one should open at random the diary of
Samuel Sewall	PERSON	, recently published in three large volumes by the
Massachusetts Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	, his eye would be very likely to fall on some such passage as the following , under date of
Nov. 6 , 1692	DATE	: ''
Joseph	PERSON	threw a knob of brass and hit his little sister
Betty	PERSON	on the forehead so as to make it bleed and swell ; upon which and for playing at prayer-time and eating when return thanks I whipped him pretty smartly .

		When I first went in -LRB- called by his grandmother -RRB- he sought to shadow and hide himself from me behind the head of the cradle ; which gave me the sorrowful re - membrance of Adam 's carriage . ''

		Inferior in literary merit to
Evelyn	PERSON	and
Pepys	PERSON	,
Sewall	PERSON	may yet be classed with his two contemporary diarists ; resembling the former in the piety which tinges his journal , and the latter in the variety of his scope and the per - sonal , even trivial , nature of much that he records .

		The author of ''
Samuel Sewall	PERSON	and the World He Lived In , '' with an enthusiasm for his theme without which , indeed , his book would not be the very readable book it is , claims that '' with these two Englishmen , in due time , by a well-weighed and just verdict ,
Samuel Sewall	PERSON	will be associated in the same lasting fame . ''


Sewall	PERSON	's life , mostly spent in or near
Boston	LOCATION	, and chiefly in the public capacities of judge and of chief justice of the supreme court of
Massa	LOCATION	- chusetts , can not fail , when carefully recorded , to be of interest ; and when the record is based largely on his voluminous diary , which covers the period from
1673	DATE	to
1729	DATE	, it must needs give us many a peep into Puritan family , social , and public life , through the eyes of one who saw them in person .

		Letters and writings of the Winthrops and the
Mathers	PERSON	, with other sources of information , are freely drawn upon , and the whole has been compiled with such scholarly care and loving zeal that one more is now added to the useful series of studies in Puritan life and history which have , in recent years , appeared from the pens of Dr.
George E. Ellis	PERSON	, Mrs.
Alice Morse Earle	PERSON	, Mr.
Frank Samuel Child	PERSON	, Mr.
Douglas Campbell	PERSON	, and other workers in this ever-fruitful field .

		In passing , it is worth while to note the totally different point of view and conclusions of Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	's book and the once much-lauded '' Puritan in

		THE DIAL 329 country at the time of the Puritan exodus con - tains many a quaint and curious touch .

		A poor widow , asking the parish clerk the price of a funeral sermon for her husband , is told that some are 10s. , and one is as low as 7s .

		6 ^ .

		, which last , however , no one would ever know to be a funeral sermon ; but that if she pays for one of the guinea sermons , there will not be a dry eye in the house .

		In those good old days of abundant leisure the post coach would some - times agree with its passengers beforehand to stop over at any town on the way where a cock - fight was in progress .

		It was nineteen days after
Cromwell	PERSON	had been made Protector before the bells were rung in
Bridgewater	LOCATION	.

		Trades - men from the Provinces commonly made their wills before going up to
London	LOCATION	, and then often walked the entire distance in that same solemn frame of mind in which
Sewall	PERSON	describes him - self as returning through vivid perils from a trip to
Cambridge	LOCATION	or
Roxbury Neck	ORGANIZATION	, noting his safe home-coming with a devout ''
Laus Deo	PERSON	'' in his diary .

		Chapters on '' The Puritan Exodus , '' ''
Sewall	PERSON	and the Puritan Church , '' and ''
Sewall	PERSON	and the Commonwealth , '' are followed by one on ''
Sewall	PERSON	as a Business Man , '' which shows him to have been shrewd and cautious in all commercial dealings .

		His education at Har - vard naturally marked him for the ministry , and he did preach a few times , on one occasion delivering a sermon of two and one-half hours ' duration good measure even for those times .

		The pictures of Indian warfare disclose many harrowing scenes .

		Mrs.
Rowlandson	PERSON	, wife of the minister of
Lancaster	LOCATION	, shows us what man - ner of men they were who settled
New England	LOCATION	, when she speaks of some little children who , on being captured with their mother by the Indians , '' did not shed one tear , but prayed all the while when their mother was killed and burnt before them . ''

		In his views on the treat - ment of both Indians and negroes , Judge
Sewall	PERSON	was far in advance of his times , and many of his words of warning ring with a singu - larly prophetic note .

		The author , by a curious argument in the appendix , claims that '' neither the Puritans of
New England	LOCATION	nor their descend - ants are responsible for the gradual extinction of the New England Indians . ''

		The introduc - tion of disease , '' the importation of civilized microbes into heathen lands , '' is made to bear the blame : for further particulars see
Darwin	PERSON	's '' Voyage of the Beagle '' and
Koch	PERSON	's researches on microbes .

		And yet it will not be at once admitted that the importation of gunpowder and whiskey did not play a large part in the extermination of Poor Lo .

		It would be inter - esting , if space permitted , to compare the totally different methods and degrees of success of the Puritan missionary movement among the Indians and that of the French Jesuits , both representing the same great church .

		The Jesuit fathers shared the life and hardships of their converts , living in the same wigwams , eating the same coarse fare , and paddling in the same canoes with them ; but even so generous a soul as the apostle Eliot , when he spent the Sabbath in
Natick	LOCATION	, took with him food prepared by his wife and dwelt apart in a chamber fitted up in his meeting-house .

		The chapter on the Salem Witchcraft shows
Sewall	PERSON	in an unfavorable light , although he afterward sorrowfully acknowledged his error in subscribing to a foolish superstition .

		In reading those portions of the work devoted to the Puritan domestic and social life , with all its dreary asceticism , one is reminded of
Macau	LOCATION	- lay 's well-known utterance to the effect that the Puritans '' hated bear-baiting , not because it gave pain to the bear , but because it gave pleasure to the spectators . ''

		Dancing , cards , music , were all forbidden ; while their few books were so dull that conversation with a cow would have been a refreshing stimulant in comparison .

		But in the chapter on ''
Betty Sewall	PERSON	and Puritan Marriages , '' human nature or at least woman nature is seen to have been much the same then as now ; while the account , as taken from his diary , of Se wall 's flirtations , marriages , and other amatory escapades , after the death of his first wife in
1717	DATE	when he himself was sixty - five years old demonstrates the traditional superiority of an old fool 's folly over that of a young one .

		Like many people who have launched into autobiography , this aged charmer does not know when to close his diary , and his biographer thinks it only right to punish him for his indiscretion by giving to the world some of his later entries along with the rest .

		Shall we regard his autumnal frivol - ity as one more proof that human nature will not be denied its rights , and , if forced to con - form to a strait-laced Puritanism in its
spring	DATE	- time , will kick up its heels in old age ?

		The book is well illustrated with portraits and other cuts , and provided with an appendix of interesting matter , but has no index , which is really demanded by its 319 pages of miscel - laneous material , nor any list of authorities , which would have been welcome to the student .

Burma	LOCATION	as it Was , Is , and Will Be '' -LRB- 1886 -RRB- , a useful book , though not quoted in Mrs.
Hart	PERSON	's rather meagre list of authorities . ''

		Picturesque Bur - ma '' gives a clear summary account of the coun - try and the people , their customs , religion , and history .

		Mrs.
Hart	PERSON	's travels were not exten - sive , and in her description of the country , as elsewhere , she relies much on
Yule	ORGANIZATION	and other writers .

		She describes from report , but in apparent good faith , `` the deadly pangu spider '' as striking '' the serpent with its poison fang , and outvenoming the most venomous in hate , '' sucking '' the brains of its victim . ''

		As a sample of the book , we quote Mrs.
Hart	PERSON	's ac - count of Burmese women . ''

		Women in
Burma	LOCATION	are probably freer and happier than they are anywhere else in the world .

		Though
Burma	LOCATION	is bordered on one side by
China	LOCATION	, where women are held in contempt , and on the other by
India	LOCATION	, where they are kept in the strictest seclusion , Burmese women have achieved for themselves and have been permitted by their men to attain a freedom of life and action that has no parallel among Oriental peoples .

		The secret lies , perhaps , in the fact that the Burmese woman is active and industrious , while the Burmese man is indo - lent and often a recluse .

		Becoming , therefore , both by taste and by habit the money-earner , the bargainer and the financier of the household , she has asserted and obtained for herself the right to hold what she wins and the respect due to one who can and does direct and con - trol .

		Things are strangely reversed in
Burma	LOCATION	, for here we see man as the religious soul of the nation and woman its brain .

		Burmese women are born traders , and it is more often the wife than the husband who * PICTURESQUE

		drives the bargain with the English buyer for the paddy harvest , or , at any rate , she is present on the occasion and helps her easy-going husband to stand firm .

		So highly is trading esteemed , that a daughter of well-to - do parents , and even a young married woman , will set up a booth in the bazaar , and , dressed in a bright silk tamein -LRB- skirt -RRB- and white jacket , with a flower jauntily stuck into her coiled black tresses , she will start every morning with a tray of sweetmeats , fruit , or toys on her head , and , with a gaiety and grace born of the sun - shine and the bounteousness of the land , will push a brisk trade all through the short and sunny day .

		The earnings thus made are the woman 's own , and can not be touched by her husband . ''

		The author concludes her very optimistic book with these remarks : '' The long independence of the Burmese nation , the absence of caste , the free position of the women , the ethical and non-idolatrous character of the Buddhist religion , the freedom from the thraldom of a priest - hood , have combined to make
Burma	LOCATION	as distinctive in character from
Hindu	LOCATION	nationalities as is
Japan	LOCATION	.

		To be passed under the rule of the English , to be freed from tyranny , to be taught good government , is a happy fate for
Burma	LOCATION	.

		As the country improves in population , in wealth , and in education , it may in the far future re - cover its lost nationality , and , freed from ancient Bur - mese tyranny and cruelty , give the world the example of a people who know how to be happy without caring incessantly to toil , and to be joyous without desiring insatiably to possess . ''

		But it will certainly occur to many readers of even this book that the Burmese are so weak a people that they are destined to be absorbed and obliterated lay the Chinese and English .

		Mrs.
Hart	PERSON	does not regard missionary work with great favor , though the work of the American Baptists among the Karens is highly praised .

		On the whole Mrs.
Hart	PERSON	's work can be commended as a popular and pleasant sketch , although she gives little that is really new , and her treatment is not very thorough .

		The book is provided with good maps and illustrated with excellent photogravures and woodcuts . ''

		The
New Africa	LOCATION	'' is the ambitious title of the next volume on our list of travels .

		How - ever , the really new
Africa	LOCATION	explored by the writers , Messrs.
Aurel Schulz	PERSON	and
August	DATE	Ham - mar , was only a small section of the Chobe and Okovanga rivers in the central part of
South Africa	LOCATION	; and the real interest in this work does not lie in its rather meagre scientific results , but rather in its excellence as a narrative of adven - ture and sport .

		The authors ' many adventures with savage beasts and men are detailed in a simple , direct , unassuming way , without any pre - tentious and strained literary art , and yet with a natural spontaneous vividness which is very attractive .

		Mr.
Schulz	PERSON	fell in with a tribe of giants where he had '' the most novel experi - ence '' of being '' a small man in a crowd , as the
1897	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 331 six foot two inches I stand in my socks generally reverses the position in other society . ''

		The men of this tribe were all nearly seven feet tall .

		Again , he describes the very strange and amusing method by which some naked savages keep warm . ''

		They build themselves little oblong frameworks of green wood , sixteen inches high , on top of which they made fires .

		Sleeping under this for warmth , the burn - ing embers often fell through the framework on their naked skins , raising blisters , which , when healed , left the affected part white or grey .

		It is from this circum - stance , widely spread in
South Africa	LOCATION	, that the
Boers	PERSON	have humorously nicknamed the tribes living west of the
Transvaal	ORGANIZATION	' Vaalpense , ' or ' grey bellies . ' ''

		The authors give a very interesting account of
Victoria Falls	LOCATION	, which has '' at least four times the volume of water and over three times the height '' of
Niagara	LOCATION	, and which '' burst on one 's sensibilities immediately with appalling grand - eur . ''

		Altogether , despite some inelegancies of style , this work is quite the best book of adven - ture and sport we have met for some time .

		The volume contains a route map , which will mean little to general readers , and should be supple - mented by a complete map of
South Africa	LOCATION	.

		The illustrations are for the most part fairly good .

		One illustration with accompanying re - marks , and also some later remarks on a mal - formation , are more suited to a medical work than to one intended for popular circulation .

		Another book on
South Africa	LOCATION	, but of quite a different order , is Mr.
James Bryce	PERSON	's '' Im - pressions of
South Africa	LOCATION	, '' of which the readers of the '' Century Magazine '' have already had a taste .

		This book is of the same kind as the author 's famous '' American Commonwealth , '' though on a much smaller scale , and shows the same acuteness and care , the same judicious temper and comprehensiveness of view , the same clear and luminous style .

		The work on
South Africa	LOCATION	consists of a short account of the country and people , a historical summary , and some notes of travel , the whole forming much the most reliable and useful general account that has yet appeared .

		Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	finds in the mining and ranch country a frontier life which he contrasts favorably with frontier life in the
United States	LOCATION	, and he looks in the near future to great prosperity for a South African Confederation under the suzerainty of
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	's studies were made in
1895	DATE	, but the book has been brought down to date .

		The maps , physical and political , are very useful features .

		Mr.
Poultney Bigelow	PERSON	's `` White Man 's
Africa	LOCATION	'' is made up of papers that have ap - peared in ''
Harper	PERSON	's Magazine , '' and gives in pleasant form the result of the author 's personal observations in a brief trip through English , Portuguese , and Boer
South Africa	LOCATION	.

		The Boer question is treated at some length .

		Mr.
Bige	PERSON	- low made the acquaintance of President
Kruger	PERSON	, whom he characterizes thus : ''
Kruger	PERSON	is the incarnation of local self-government in its purest form .

		He is president among his burghers by the same title that he is elder in his church .

		He makes no pretention to rule them by invoking the law , but he does rule them by reasoning with them until they yield to his superiority in argument .

		He rules among free burghers because he knows them well and they know him well .

		He knows no red-tape nor pigeon-holes .

		His door is open to every comer ; his memory recalls every face ; he listens to every complaint , and sits in patriarchal court from six o'clock in the morning until bedtime .

		He is a magnificent anachronism .

		He alone is equal to the task of holding his singular country to - gether in its present state .

		His life is the history of that state .

		Already we hear the rumblings that indicate for the
Transvaal	LOCATION	an earthquake of some sort .

		We pray they may not disturb the declining years of that coun - try 's hero the patient , courageous , forgiving , loyal , and sagacious
Paul Kruger	PERSON	. ''

		Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	speaks severely of Portuguese misgovernment , but he has much praise for
Orange Free State	ORGANIZATION	,
Cape of Good Hope	LOCATION	, and for
Natal	ORGANIZATION	, `` the Colonial Paradise . ''

		The book con - tains historical matter of value , and two folk - lore stories that will interest the anthropologist .

		The chief criticism that we have to offer is that the book is too obviously a rather hasty `` write - up , '' and too journalistic in quality .

		The numerous illustrations are well drawn and very interesting .

		The well-known English archaeologist , Mr.
W. M. Ramsay	PERSON	, modestly entitles his latest vol - ume '' Impressions of
Turkey	LOCATION	'' ; but , as a m atter of fact , we find here , not what many readers might expect , superficial and rapid notes , but close and careful studies of Turkish life and character , which are the fruit of twelve years of observa - tion in manifold wanderings through
Asia	LOCATION	Minor .

		In a suggestive , thoughtful , impartial , yet sympathetic way , he describes and discusses the Turk and other
Mohammedan	DATE	races , the Armenian , the Greek , and the American mis - sionary and his adherents .

		As to the latter , we may well quote a sentence or two from the pre - face to the American edition of Mr.
Ramsay	PERSON	's work : '' My hope is that this book may do something to pro- duce in
America	LOCATION	an adequate conception of the great educational organization which the American mission - aries have built up in
Turkey	LOCATION	with admirable foresight and skill .

		Beginning with a prejudice against their work , I was driven by the force of facts and experience to the opinion that the mission has been the strongest , 332 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, as well as the most beneficent , influence in causing the movement toward civilization which has been percept - ible in varying degrees among all the peoples of
Turkey	LOCATION	, but which has been zealously opposed and almost arrested by the present Sultan with the support of the
Six Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean Powers . ''

		As to the Armenian massacres , Mr.
Ramsay	PERSON	writes : '' There has been no exaggeration in the worst ac - counts of the horrors of
Armenia	LOCATION	.

		A writer with the vivid imagination ` of
Dumas	PERSON	, and the knowledge of evil that Zola possesses , could not attain , by any description , the effect that the sight of one massacre in the Kurdish part of
Armenia	LOCATION	would produce on any spectator .

		The Kurdish part of
Armenia	LOCATION	is the ' black country . '

		It has been a charnal house .

		One dare not enter it .

		One can - not think about it .

		One knows not how many maimed , mutilated , outraged Armenians are still starving there . ''

		Mr.
Ramsay	PERSON	's book is clearly and pleasantly written .

		He is a man of very careful and catholic observation and judgment , and he comes , perhaps , nearer than any recent writer to the truth about
Turkey	LOCATION	.

		The American publishers of
Taine	PERSON	's works ,
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, have issued , in uni - form style with their previous edition , a volume by him entitled `` Journeys through
France	LOCATION	. ''

		This book consists of notes evidently made by
M. Taine	PERSON	, while on his journeys as examiner in law for the provinces .

		Such provincial cities as
Douai	LOCATION	,
Rennes	LOCATION	,
Bourdeaux	LOCATION	,
Toulouse	LOCATION	, Mar - seilles , are sharply and clearly characterized from the Tainesque point of view , that is , as influenced by environment .

		Thus on
Douai	LOCATION	and its vicinity he remarks : '' These are verita - ble low countries , and that implies everything , morally and physically . ''

		Among many acute and suggestive remarks on art we quote this : '' Nowadays , painters recognize the violent , strange , or poetic side of nature ; but their peasants are no more than physiological studies .

		The future in every art is for such as select or meet with subjects which all suc - ceeding generations will approve .

		Happiness is one of these themes , but nervous disorders and psychological peculiarities are not amongst them .

		I could not perceive the beauty of happiness until I was well advanced in life .

		In the early days this did not come home to me , or I thought it stale . ''

		While this book is not one of
Taine	PERSON	's best , yet it is of considerable interest as a series of literary etchings of French provincialism .

		Yet in this work , as in others by him , we often feel that he is over analytic and over reflective in his positive type of mind ; and yet again we often feel that he is only a high type of dilet - tante , seeking experience for its own sake , and revelling in a soft and sad sensuousness .

		The woodcuts in this volume are of the old-fashioned picturesque style , and in some cases , as that of
Rennes	LOCATION	, scarcely illustrate the text .

		M.
Rene Bazin	PERSON	, a French litterateur of note , has written an agreeable and instructive little book on `` The Italians of To-day . ''

		These notes show a Frenchman 's keenness of percep - tion and clearness of expression , touching luminously and freshly on the condition of in - dustry , politics , literature , and art , in various parts of
Italy	LOCATION	.


M. Bazin	PERSON	's sympathetic sociality and urbanity , and his artistic appreciation , are everywhere apparent .

		A delicate impressionism and graceful sentimentality abound ; though sometimes the former is too sketchy , and the latter too effusive .

		And yet the author is quite able to deal with plain facts in a prosaic and scientific way , as we see , for instance , in his account of Italian taxation .

		Perhaps the best thing in the book is the quite full and interesting description of the little-visited Roman Cam - pagna , from which we extract this pretty etch - ing as a sample of the author 's description : '' On my way back to the city I saw a splendid sight .

		In a field which was axe-shaped , broadening in the dis - tance , fifteen pair of gray oxen were ploughing in line .

		The fifteen ploughs were exactly aligned , opening and throwing out earth which was a reddish-purple color .

		These are the same implements of husbandry that Ver - gil saw , an iron wedge , two wooden wings in front of a joist , a round platform behind , traversed by an upright stick .

		On the platform stands the laborer , with one hand holding by the upright , with the other using the goad .

		And these beautiful , primitive forms of labor , the immense oxen , the small plough , the man , motion - less and stately , were moving slowly forward , leaving half the field furrowed and steaming behind them . ''

		While this book does not pretend to a com - plete discussion of its subject , it will yet be of service , and by reason of its style it can not fail to amuse and interest .

		Miss
Eliza Scidmore	PERSON	, in ''
Java	LOCATION	, the Garden of the East , '' the contents of which have in part appeared in the '' Century Magazine , '' gives a facile and agreeable though not especially note - worthy sketch of the
Java	LOCATION	of to-day .

		Her travel was confined to a trip over the line of railway which the Dutch have constructed through the center of
Java	LOCATION	, and much of the volume is of the guide-book order a general description with little personal flavor .

		However , her pic - ture of
Java	LOCATION	is clear , and seems correct as far as it goes .

		The island is about the size of the state of
New York	LOCATION	, and yet contains 24,000,000 inhabitants , who have made its whole country a veritable garden . ''

		All
Java	LOCATION	is in a way as finished as little
Holland	LOCATION	itself , the whole island cultivated from edge to edge like a tulip-garden , and connected throughout its length with post - roads smooth and perfect as park drives , all arched with waringen , kanari , tamarind , or teak

		The rank and tangled jungle is invisible , save by long journeys ; and great snakes , wild tigers , and rhinoceroses are almost unknown now .

		One must go to
Borneo	LOCATION	and the farther islands to see them , too . ''

		In short we see '' the tropics tamed , combed , and curbed , hitched to the cart of commerce and made mart 's abject servant . ''

		Miss
Scidmore	PERSON	's descriptions of the ruins at
Boro Boeder	PERSON	and
Brambanam	PERSON	are per - haps the most valuable portion of the book .

		The photographic illustrations are quite suc - sessful .

		The volume called '' In Journeyings Oft '' is distinctly a missionary book , recording the travels , in
1894	DATE	, of Mrs.
Mary C. Nind	PERSON	, as an officer of the Woman 's
Methodist Missionary Society	ORGANIZATION	, visiting mission stations in
Japan	LOCATION	,
China	LOCATION	,
Burma	LOCATION	, and
India	LOCATION	.

		It is well written and illustrated , and will be of special service to missionary societies .

		The book is introduced to the public by Mrs.
Nind	PERSON	's kinsman the well - known Bishop Nind . ''

		With a Pessimist in
Spain	LOCATION	'' is the playful title , referring to a companion in a tour through
Spain	LOCATION	, which Miss
Mary F. Nixon	PERSON	has chosen for a brief and agreeable book of travels .

		The story of a commonplace tour is told in a famil - iar , humorous vein , and in a brisk conversa - tional form , whereby the author adroitly pops instructive pills from the guide-book into the unsuspecting reader 's mind .

		Bright , pleasant , lively as it is , we feel sometimes that it is too strenuously entertaining .

		The style is some - times a bit careless in a feminine way , as when she informs us that '' the Pessimist is a dear , but she is not built for dignity . ''

		The illus - trations are good , and the book as a whole will serve as a popular account of the regions visited .


HIRAM M. STANLEY	PERSON	.

		A MONUMENTAL , BIRD BOOK .

		* The past two or three years have been pro- lific of works on Ornithology meriting unre - served approval .

		The student in this branch of natural history need have no future difficulty in selecting a treatise suited to his needs .

		From a varied and admirable series , the novice and the expert may now make his choice .

		At the head of the list , for purposes of refer - ence , stands the recently completed '' Diction - * A DICTIONARY OF BIRDS .

		By
Alfred Newton	PERSON	, assisted by
Hans Qadow	PERSON	.

		With contributions from
Richard Lydekker	PERSON	,
Charles S. Roy	PERSON	, and
Robert W. Shufeldt	PERSON	,
M.D. New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		ary of Birds , '' by Dr.
Alfred Newton	PERSON	, Professor of Zoology and Biology in
Magdalene College	ORGANIZATION	,
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		The work has been in process of publication at the press of Messrs.
Adam	PERSON	and
Charles Black	PERSON	of
Edinburgh	LOCATION	, since
1889	DATE	, four several parts being issued at varying intervals , the final one bearing the date of
1897	DATE	.

		In its completed form , the book , a large octavo , com - prises nearly 1100 pages .

		The Introduction , extending through 120 pages , is in itself worth the price of the volume , presenting as it does a detailed account of the growth of ornithology from its obscure beginnings in the time of Aris - totle to its present stage of active development .

		The reader is impressed by the author 's firm grasp of his subject , and by the calm and im - partial judgment manifest in handling it .

		No point is left untouched in the delineation , and in each instance due acknowledgment is made of the services of the contributor who has lent appreciable aid to the advance of the science .

		This masterly Introduction compresses into a clear and comprehensive view the whole history of ornithology down to the latest date .

		The body of the dictionary is composed mainly of the articles prepared by Professor
Newton	PERSON	originally for the
British Encyclopedia	ORGANIZATION	.

		These have been , where necessary , enlarged and re-shaped to admit the latest facts and conclu - sions pertaining to their respective topics .

		The special department of ornithic anatomy has been given into the hands of Dr.
Hans Gadow	PERSON	, whose name certifies to the ability with which it has been managed .

		Other collaborators who have added value and variety of interest to the work are Mr.
Lydekker	PERSON	and Professor Ray , the one a pupil , the other a colleague of Professor
Newton	PERSON	, and Dr.
Shufeldt	PERSON	, formerly of the
United States Army	ORGANIZATION	.

		The articles , arranged in alphabetical order , are uniformly concise , crowding into the smallest space the largest amount of information allowed by the dimen - sions of the work .

		It is fair to say that not a bird which may reasonably claim mention has been omitted from the catalogue of definitions , while the myriad names used early or late in the classification of species will be found each in its proper place .

		The extent of the infor - mation conveyed may be inferred without fur - ther detail .

		A map accompanying the long and able essay on the geographical distribution of birds , and a considerable number of engrav - ings interspersed through the text , complete the usefulness of what may be justly denomi - nated a monumental work .


SARA A. HUBBARD	PERSON	.

		334 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, THE TOUCHSTONE OF FACT IN MATTERS OF STYLE .

		* Like the contests of Homeric heroes are the word-battles of Dr.
Fitzedward Hall	PERSON	and Mr.
R. O. Williams	PERSON	.

		Ordinary persons stand amazed as they lightly handle weapons which ten com - mon men could hardly lift , and sustain the most brain-stunning shocks with result only of the most annihilating ripostes .

		We think of no equals to them since the days of Dr.
John	PERSON	- son and
Home Tooke	PERSON	, or perhaps we should go back to
Socrates	LOCATION	and Cratylus , and even of these we must gain a notion at second-hand from the photographs of Landor and
Plato	ORGANIZATION	.

		Our modern method is to preserve such en - counters in the kinetoscope ; Mr.
Williams	PERSON	's publication of some of his letters , with Dr.
Hall	PERSON	's replies , makes us absolute spectators .

		The range of this interesting book is not very great : some half a dozen questions only are exploited , and these are of a minor character .

		Known to , none but they , the imperfect passive , in or at with place names , to part with , every and each , these , and '' the American dialect , '' are the chief topics .

		Knowledge on them is pleas - ant , but it is not too much to say that we could live , write , and speak happily without discom - forting ourselves very much on their account .

		But , actually , a book like this has a far greater import than might appear at first sight .

		It marks a point well worth noting in the speaking and writing of correct English .

		Some nations have definite authorities that can be appealed to in disputed cases ; we have none .

		Our principle of leaving to private enterprise all that government is not compelled to assume as a charge , has left the regulating our speech to the private effort of grammarians and lexi - cographers , and no one of these powers being , as such , of any especial authority -LRB- despite the most vigorous advertisement and commenda - tion -RRB- , one and all take their stand on the rock of '' good usage . ''

		Other considerations may enter into discussion , but this is the great foundation stone , or , more accurately , touch - stone .

		Hence the importance in any given case of knowing what good usage is .

		In many cases the fact -LRB- carefully hidden from sight -RRB- is that `` good usage '' is a kind of Mrs.
Harris	PERSON	: '' there 's no sich person . ''

		But often it would seem that there is a sort of instinct among good writers which leads them in any particu - lar case to follow one mode of expression * SOME QUESTIONS OF GOOD ENGLISH .

		rather than another .

		Now , curiously enough , in disputed cases , not only are the disputants very often ignorant of what good usage is , but they usually make no serious effort to find it out .

		This , however , is just what Mr.
Williams	PERSON	and Dr.
Hall	PERSON	do , in as many cases as a good God gives them strength to compass .

		Mr.
Williams	PERSON	gives twenty-four citations from as many authors to show the use of each , thirty - three citations to illustrate misplacement of only .

		Dr.
Hall	PERSON	mentions fifty-nine respecta - ble writers since
1820	DATE	, in discussing the imper - fect passive .

		Such work certainly gives an example of thoroughness .

		It shows how men ought to read if they would know how good writers express themselves ; it shows the basis upon which opinions as to correct diction should rest ; it shows what `` good usage '' ought to mean .

		We are far too apt to fancy that two or three examples will settle the mat - ter enough for our purposes .

		From this point of view Mr.
Williams	PERSON	's book is valuable .

		Interesting it is , too , and often amusing * -LRB- neither of these gladiators is with - out a sense of humor -RRB- , and certainly a book that one likes to have .

		But beyond this , it is a noteworthy book , for it gives a better idea than the average reader has of what is meant , or should be meant , by '' good usage . ''


EDWARD E. HALE	PERSON	, JR. .

		* Most amusing , perhaps , is the entry
s.v. Hall	PERSON	in the Index of Words and Phrases .

		HOLIDAY PUBLICATIONS .

		i.
Herr Sienkiewicz	PERSON	's highly successful novel '' Quo Vadis '' comes to us from Messrs. Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	in two shapely octavo volumes resplendent in the Holiday pomp of rich purple-and-gold bind - ings , and liberally strewn with full-page illustra - tions in photogravure .

		The artists are Messrs.
Howard Pyle	PERSON	,
E. H. Garrett	PERSON	, and
Evert Van Muy	ORGANIZATION	- den .

		Of these gentlemen the one last named seems to us to have done the best work .

		His drawings have a strength which Mr.
Garrett	PERSON	's nearly always lack , and they are superior to Mr.
Pyle	PERSON	's as pic - torial efforts of the historic imagination .

		Old
Rome	LOCATION	seems to live again in such plates of Mr.
Van Muy	PERSON	- den 's as `` The Rescue of Lygia '' and `` Nero 's Chained Lions and Tigers . ''

		Mr.
Garrett	PERSON	's draw - ings are pretty and graceful , as they usually are , and Mr.
Pyle	PERSON	's show a lively , if not at all times a sound , fancy .

		Some of Mr.
Pyle	PERSON	's work is so good that one is impelled to wonder the more at such aberrations , for example , as the central figure of his `` The Conversion of Chilo . ''

		Besides the drawings of the artists just named there are several plates 1897 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 335 from photographs of ancient busts and edifices , famous historical paintings , etc. .

		The pictorial aver - age is good , and we are glad to note the inclusion of several maps and architectural plans that will greatly assist intelligent reading .

		Altogether the edition is a very attractive and tasteful one , and should prove one of the successes of the season .

		Messrs.
Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	issue in a fine tall folio volume entitled `` All Hands , '' the series of pictures of life in the
United States Navy	ORGANIZATION	, hy Mr.
R. F. Zogbaum	PERSON	, which have during the past year or so formed a striking feature of some of the firm 's serial publications .

		Everybody is more or less fa - miliar with Mr.
Zogbaum	PERSON	's realistic and spirited work , which is as distinctly sui generis and as easily recognizable as is that of Mr.
Remington	PERSON	or Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	.

		It is evident throughout the present series of plates that the artist has a very warm place in - deed in his heart for '' Jack '' who is , he thinks , despite the fact that he goes down to sea nowadays , not in ships , but in floating forts or colossal tanks -LRB- `` tea-kettles , '' Farragut called them -RRB- , very much the same sort of jovial , free-handed chap that he was '' in
Rodney	PERSON	's day . ''

		We should say that '' Jack '' of to-day is much more of a mechanic and rather less of a sailor than were the pig-tailed '' Tom Bowl - ings '' and '' long Tom Coffins '' of yore .

		But if he ca n't '' reef , furl , and handle , '' and '' sailorize '' gen - erally , as well as his salter predecessors could , he has n't forgotten the art of '' splicing the main-brace , '' as some of Mr.
Zogbaum	PERSON	's pictures indicate .

		The series is both instructive and entertaining .

		It deals with every phase of life aboard the modern man-of - war , ranging from grave to gay , from peace to war , from cabin to forecastle .

		It shows us
Jack	PERSON	afloat and
Jack	PERSON	ashore ; Jack at work and

		There is no text save a brief general introduction on the modern battle-ship and the American naval question in general .

		Mr.
Zogbaum	PERSON	is naturally of opinion that if we are going to have a navy at all , we ought to have an effective one one in fact as well as in name , and one to be proud of rather than ashamed of .

		A cheap navy breeds contempt and insult in time of peace , and disaster in time of war .


Washington	LOCATION	's maxim , `` To be prepared for war is the most effectual means to promote peace , '' is worth weighing ; and the greatly improved condi - tion of our
navy	ORGANIZATION	to-day ought to be a source of satis - faction to every American .

		Mr.
Zogbaum	PERSON	's lively pictures afford us an excellent means of studying the life on board of `` Uncle
Sam	PERSON	's '' new ironclads , and the publishers have grouped them conveniently in one of the season 's handsomest gift-books .

		In his preface to '' Drawings by
Frederic Rem	PERSON	- ington '' -LRB-
R. H. Russell	PERSON	-RRB- , Mr.
Owen Wister	PERSON	tries to analyze the charm of the far West .

		It eludes him , as he knew it would , except so much as he expresses in the phrase , '' escaped back to nature . '' ''

		The silence of that world , '' he says , '' seems to have come unbroken from behind Genesis , to have been earlier than the beginning , to make one with the planets , to have known mysteries that dwindle
Rome	LOCATION	to a show . ''

		It is perhaps only to the initiated that such phrases are not hyperbole ; one must have been thrilled by the plains themselves to realize their profound significance .

		But those who have known the life of the ranches are always com - rades , as Mr.
Wister	PERSON	points out ; and to them this book of Mr.
Remington	PERSON	's will appeal with peculiar force .

		Interest in it may be languid for others , but not for them .

		And they know that the artist , also , has felt `` the nameless magic of the plains . ''

		There is something more than realism in many of these pictures ; there is an imaginative grasp of the situation .

		Behind the poverty and loneliness , the activity and daring of this life , Mr.
Remington	PERSON	sees its color , its poetry .

		Upon him , too , '' the wilder - ness has set its spell . ''

		In such drawings as '' The Pony War-Dance '' and '' The Coming Storm '' he expresses something of the mystery , the primitive Titanic grandeur , of the race that is passing away .

		In these , and in '' Hostiles Watching the Column '' and '' The Missionary and the Medicine Man , '' he unites man with the elements , and he seems to bring the pitiful solitude into conjunction with the rest of the world .

		Yet there are other drawings in which the realism is almost photographic , and it is not in them that we find the many evidences of growth .

		Mr.
Remington	PERSON	has done much , also , for the ranchman and the soldier , and in both he gives us the real thing .

		These are no play cowboys , prettily decked out in sombreros and chaparreros .

		Like the soldiers , they have seen hard service , and one feels absolute confidence in their ability to rope a steer or break a broncho .

		When all this wild pic - turesque life shall have passed away , this record of Mr.
Remington	PERSON	's will have enormous historical value .

		Professor
W. M. Sloane	PERSON	's elaborately mounted '' Life of
Napoleon Bonaparte	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- comes to an end with Volume IV. , now before us .

		With the general style and quality of the work our readers are doubtless already tolerably familiar .

		Without displaying any marked force or grace of narration , it maintains a respectable level of literary merit throughout .

		The chief value of the work springs from the author 's intimate knowledge of his theme in all its details .

		He tells his story directly , without rhetorical flourish , and with a constant view to the tastes and capacities of the average magazine reader .

		The Life is , therefore , an excellent one for popular reading ; and as such we cordially recom - mend it .

		Its sumptuous setting makes it a desirable gift-book of the more expensive sort .

		Professor
Sloane	PERSON	's conception of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	is rational and im - partial , he having plainly divested his mind of the stock exaggerations of the Napoleonic legend .

		The present volume , opening with the retreat from Mos - cow and closing with the final scene at
St. Helena	ORGANIZATION	, treats in full detail such events as the crossing of 336 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, the
Beresina	LOCATION	, the rise of the nations , the end of the
Grand Army	ORGANIZATION	, the invasion of
France	LOCATION	, the fall of
Paris	LOCATION	,
Elba	PERSON	,
Ligny	LOCATION	,
Quatre Bras	ORGANIZATION	,
Waterloo	LOCATION	.

		A list of historical sources is appended .

		The illustrations comprise nineteen full-page plates in color after his - torical paintings by
Orchardson	PERSON	,
Flameng	LOCATION	,
Geri	PERSON	- cault , Berne-Bellecour ,
Vernet	PERSON	, Meissohier , etc. , to - gether with plates prepared especially for the work by
Myrbach	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volume is well supplied with maps .

		While the pictures -LRB- serving the end of em - bellishment rather than instruction -RRB- do not exactly meet our views of the proper illustration of history , they are generally beautiful and striking in them - selves , and lend the work a distinct character and attractiveness as a Holiday publication .

		Messrs.
McDonnell Bros.	ORGANIZATION	, of
Chicago	LOCATION	, are the general agents for the work .

		Among the many well-known works that appear this season in a holiday edition , Irving 's ''
Astoria	LOCATION	'' is given a conspicuous place .

		It is presented in the elaborate style of decoration and embellishment adopted by its publishers -LRB- Putnam -RRB- for their an - nual holiday selection from
Irving	LOCATION	's works , the num - ber for this year being appropriately called the '' Ta - coma '' edition .

		It is published in two volumes , with a good cover in red brown and gold on white , and is illustrated with numerous photogravures based chiefly on photographs and representing the work of
Messrs. Church	ORGANIZATION	,
Beard	ORGANIZATION	,
Zogbaum	LOCATION	,
Eaton	LOCATION	, and other artists .

		Each page of text is framed in a col - ored decorative border , the work of
Miss Margaret Armstrong	ORGANIZATION	.

		The result is a striking presentation of the famous '' anecdotes of an enterprise beyond the
Rocky Mountains	LOCATION	. ''

		Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons have chosen for their leading holiday work this year Mr.
Cable	PERSON	's `` Old Creole Days . ''

		The volume is clearly and tastefully printed , and is given an effective cover in grays .

		Its greatest charm , however , is in the drawings , by Mr.
Albert Herter	PERSON	, which have marked individuality and character .

		Except in the frontis - piece , the rich beauty of the Creole type almost eludes the artist .

		His drawings are delightful , but they might represent the North as well as the South .

		The delicacy of the author 's differentiation is not quite aught .

		In spite of this , however , the work is one of the most beautiful and satisfactory of the holiday books of the year .

		Thoreau 's '' Walden '' is republished by
Messrs. Houghton	PERSON	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	in two volumes , with an introduction by Mr.
Bradford Torrey	PERSON	, himself a familiar of the woods .

		He proclaims at the begin - ning that in spite of itself the world likes eccentric people . ''

		Its Wisdom is prudence , '' he says . ''

		Its rule of life is to keep on the safe side .

		Follow the path , it says ; take no risks .

		Yet it admires au - dacity , independence , originality , and , after the event , applauds nothing so much as a violation of its own maxims . ''

		In a spirit of sympathy and ad - miration Mr.
Torrey	PERSON	writes of
Thoreau	PERSON	and his work , defending him , unnecessarily perhaps , from un - worthy attacks , but feeling that '' Time , the ultimate critic , has taken his part , and is very unlikely to forget him in the day of final award . ''

		The books are well printed , and illustrated with many good photogravures , portraits of
Thoreau	PERSON	and his friends , their homes and his , and landscapes show - ing the places he loved and made the world love .

		A new edition of '' The Critical Period of Amer - ican History , 1783-1789 '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Profes - sor
John Fiske	PERSON	, is enriched with numerous illustra - tions and maps .

		The text has been carefully revised , and the illustrations selected by the author with special regard to their historical value .

		There are many portraits , some of which , like the very indi - vidual one of
James Madison	PERSON	, are quite unfamiliar ; and many interesting facsimiles of early documents and engravings .

		In addition to these , Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	has resurrected some curious old caricatures , which are eloquent of popular feeling at the time .

		The book is very well printed and bound , and the illustrations add greatly to the value of a work which without them had no rival .

		Mrs.
Maud Wilder Goodwin	PERSON	's historical stories , `` The Head of a Hundred '' and `` White Aprons , '' come to us boxed together as a set and in dainty Holiday dress , under the joint title `` Romances of Colonial
Virginia	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		We have had occasion before to praise these wholesome and tenderly imaginative tales of the Old Dominion .

		Mrs.
Goodwin	PERSON	has done well to turn her serious his - torical studies , directly embodied in her capital little study of '' The Colonial Cavalier , '' to artistic account .

		The action of the stories is well thought out , the sit - uations are effective , and the love-scenes duly tender and genuine .

		The dialogue is fairly animated , and just touched with a due degree of archaism though here , it must be noted , Mrs.
Goodwin	PERSON	's little fishes do incline at times to talk like whales and just a trifle in the style of the superfine heroes and heroines of the eighteenth-century novel .

		But where the whole is so good , critical flaw-picking is ungracious ; and we gladly welcome Mrs. Good - win 's popular tales in their new and seasonable set - ting .

		The volumes are tastily bound in light-green ornately stamped in gilt , and ' each contains five photogravure plates , together with decorative head - ings and an ornamental title-page .

		Altogether the little set is most enticing , and should find its way to many a Holiday table this season .

		Of the making of books on themes colonial there seems now to be no end .

		The latest writer to ex - ploit this prolific field is ''
Marion Harland	PERSON	, '' and her book , `` Some Colonial Homesteads and their Stories '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , is in form and content one of the most attractive of its kind .

		The more or less romantic stories that cluster like ancestral ivy round the picturesque old houses described by Mrs. Ter - hune are told by her with evident gusto and a cer - tain old-fashioned preciosity of style that is appro - priate enough and not at all unpleasant .

		The tales were gathered during the narrator 's visits at the houses described -LRB- `` historical shrines , '' she calls them -RRB- ; and she testifies to the '' gracious readiness ''
1897	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 337 of the present representatives of the ancient Van Cortlandts ,
Morrises	ORGANIZATION	, Schuylers ,
Smiths	ORGANIZATION	, and so on , to place their ancestral parchments and muniments of nobility at her disposal even , we presume , with the full knowledge that not only was she '' amang '' them with the express purpose of '' takin ' notes , '' but that , like Captain
Grose	PERSON	, she was eke going to `` prent it . ''

		Family records , manuscript letters , old portraits , were freely turned over for her inspection ; and she is even able to gratify her readers with an occasional peep at an interesting ancestral family skeleton , in itself no bad title to social distinction ; the next best thing socially , as we know , to having a particularly good ancestor to point to , being to have a particularly bad one .

		Though the historical interest of the book is of course rather slight , Mrs.
Terhune	PERSON	makes good her claim to the due degree of historical accuracy in the framework of recorded fact that surrounds her sketches .

		Among the co - lonial homesteads described are the Virginian seats of
Brandon	LOCATION	,
Westover	LOCATION	,
Shirley	PERSON	, etc. , the
Morris House	ORGANIZATION	at
Germantown	LOCATION	, the
Schuyler	PERSON	and
Colfax Houses of New Jersey	ORGANIZATION	, the
New York	LOCATION	manor houses of the Van Cortlandts ,
Livingstones	LOCATION	,
Philipses	LOCATION	, the
Jumel Mansion	ORGANIZATION	, the
Pierce House	ORGANIZATION	and the ''
Parson Williams	ORGANIZATION	'' House of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, and the
Smith House of Connecticut	ORGANIZATION	.

		The illustrations comprise a great number of views of historic sites and homes , architectural details , coats-of-arms , portraits , etc. .

		The volume is clearly printed on lightly glazed paper , and forms a dainty and acceptable gift-book .

		A book about our own country , which Mr.
Edmund H. Garrett	PERSON	has written and illustrated , bears the rather ponderous title of '' Romance and Reality of the Puritan Coast '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It was written avowedly around the pictures , which are certainly the charm of the book ; but it describes in the idlest fashion the '' north shore '' of the
Massa	PERSON	- chusetts coast , and encourages the art of '' strolling a-wheel . ''

		A little history and a little romance are mixed up with the modern wheeling and bathing and yachting , and there are occasional delightful pictures of the dames and squires of other days .

		The text is very light and very rambling , but it forms an appropriate setting for the pretty pictures .

		`` Historic
New York	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is amore serious treatment of the lives of our ancestors .

		It is edited by Mrs.
Maud Wilder Goodwin	PERSON	, Mrs.
Alice Car	PERSON	- rington
Royce	PERSON	, and Miss
Ruth Putnam	PERSON	, and contains essays by several other writers who have studied the subject .

		An effort has been made to give an accurate and vivid picture of the city of
New Amsterdam	LOCATION	and its people .

		The idea is an excellent one , and it is carried out by the essayists with knowledge and skill .

		There are papers on the
State-House	ORGANIZATION	, by Mrs.
Alice Morse Earle	PERSON	; on the '' Early History of Wall Street , '' by Mr.
Oswald	PERSON	Garrison Villard ; on ''
Old Greenwich	LOCATION	, '' by Miss
Elizabeth Bisland	PERSON	; on '' The Fourteen Miles Round , '' by Mr.
Alfred B. Mason	PERSON	and Mrs.
Mary Murdoch Mason	PERSON	; and on the Bowery ,
King 's College	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- now
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Governor 's
Island	LOCATION	, and several other subjects of interest .

		The book is a useful and timely one , for we are in danger of for - getting our Dutch ancestry in our absorption in the omniverous Puritan .

		Modestly ornate in form and freshly sweet in content are the brace of twin duodecimos severally entitled '' Travels in a Tree-Top '' and '' The Free - dom of the Fields , '' and boxed together under the joint style , '' Fireside and Forest Library '' -LRB- Lip - pincott -RRB- .

		The author is Mr.
Charles C. Abbott	PERSON	, a pleasant writer of the Thoreau-Jefferies-Burroughs school , and the volumes contain respectively seven - teen and fifteen crisp little papers , largely on sylvan scenes and pleasures .

		Mr.
Abbott	PERSON	is by no means a mere echo of his perhaps more widely read co - laborers , his work having a distinct savor of its own , a tang , as it were , like that of wild fruit .

		To read him is to retrace in fancy , and with sharpened zest and eyesight , the half-remembered delicious path of many a bygone
summer	DATE	or springtide ramble , no bad occupation for a winter 's night , when the lamp is alit and the fire glowing , and the driving sleet is drumming at the window-pane , like
Winter	DATE	tapping for admission .

		The volumes are made up in the best of taste , and each contains four accept - able illustrations by Mrs.
Alice Barber Stephens	PERSON	.

		Redolent throughout of the true spirit and signifi - cance of the great Christian festival is Dr.
Henry Van Dyke	PERSON	's sweet and tender old-time story of '' The First Christmas-Tree '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		It opens with the day before
Christmas	DATE	, in the year of our Lord 722 ; and is divided into four main scenes or phases : The Call of the Woodsman , '' '' The Trail of the Forest , '' `` The Shadow of the Thunder - Oak , '' '' The Felling of the Tree . ''

		In the first scene we are shown the peaceful cloister of Pfalzel , on the banks of the
Moselle	LOCATION	.

		.

		It is Christmas-eve ; and the pious nuns are making holiday , and awaiting with fluttered anticipation a famous visitor Winif ried of
England	LOCATION	, called
Boniface	PERSON	, the Apostle of Ger - many .

		The chapter closes with the resolve of young Prince
Gregor	PERSON	, a visitor at the convent and the son of the royal Abbess of Pfalzel , to quit the princely pomps and vanities of the life then opening out before him , and to share the lonely apostolate of Winifried among the heathen Germans .

		In the final chapter Winifried and
Gregor	PERSON	in the forest fall in with a heathen tribe who are about to sacrifice -LRB- on Christmas-eve -RRB- the son of their chief to Thor at the foot of the mystic thunder-oak .

		The arm of the Apostle interposes to stay the sacrificial axe in its descent ; the boy is saved ; the thunder-oak is felled by the missionaries ; the chief and his follow - ers accept the sign ; a stately fir is felled at the bid - ding of Winifried and borne in triumph to the great hall , where it is raised all glittering with tapers to serve as '' The First Christmas-Tree , '' while
Gregor	PERSON	and his companions chant their Christmas hymn : '' All glory be to God on high , And to the earth be peace !

		Good-will henceforth from heaven to man Begin and never cease . ''

		The book contains four beautiful photogravures 338 -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, from designs by Mr.
Howard Pyle	PERSON	, which are among the best things we remember to have seen from his pencil .

		The volume is prettily bound and well printed , and the scroll of oak-leaves and acorns en - closing the text on each page has a good effect .

		The special features of
Messrs. Fords , Howard & Hulbert	ORGANIZATION	's pretty Holiday edition of
Tennyson	LOCATION	's `` In Memoriam '' are Dr.
Henry Van Dyke	PERSON	's criti - cal and descriptive preface and the profuse deco - rative and illustrative drawings by Mr.
Harry Fenn	PERSON	.

		The poem lends itself fairly well to illustration , and Mr.
Fenn	PERSON	has acquitted himself creditably , especially in the bits of landscape thrown in here and there in accordance with the suggestions of the text .

		The merely decorative drawings , initial letters , tail-pieces , and so on , are perhaps a little stiff , and hint sometimes at a jaded or a spurred fancy ; but the effect of the ensemble is pleasing enough , and the edition may be commended to readers whose enjoyment of '' In Memoriam '' can be enhanced by pictorial aids .

		Dr.
Van Dyke	PERSON	's preface gives a brief analysis of the poem in its broader aspects , and re - counts the touching story of its origin .

		The text is fairly printed on lightly glazed paper , and the bind - ing is dainty and suggestive of the gift-book .

		Two new and sumptuous editions of '' The Faerie Queene '' are encouraging signs that we are not ab - sorbed in the modern and the eccentric to the entire exclusion of the great poets of old .

		The more beautiful of these editions is illustrated by Mr.
Walter Crane	PERSON	, and published in
London	LOCATION	by Mr.
George Allen	PERSON	, and in
New York	LOCATION	by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The work is edited by Mr.
Thomas J. Wise	PERSON	, who has attempted merely to furnish an accurate text .

		His work has been carefully done , and in his preface , besides naming his authorities , he describes with many valuable details the various early editions of the poem in such a way that collectors may easily verify their copies .

		He prints also the seventeen sonnets which were appended to the first edition , together with the five stanzas at the end of the twelfth canto of Book III. , which were suppressed in the edition of
1596	DATE	.

		The title-pages of the early editions are here reproduced in facsimile .

		The selection of an illustrator was particularly happy , as Mr.
Crane	PERSON	's style is admirably adapted to the presentation of
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	's thought .

		Mr.
Crane	PERSON	him - self seems the product of another century than ours ; there is something primitive and archaic in his very subtlety .

		He too has the love of fairies and alle - gories and of decorative pageantry , which is requisite to a true interpretation .

		It was a great opportunity for an artist , and probably no man living could have risen to it so sympathetically as Mr.
Crane	PERSON	.

		The borders for his pictures are rich in decorative sym - bolism , assisting and completing the allegory , and forming , with their conventionalized trees and fig - ures , an exquisitely beautiful frame .

		In the designs themselves there is great beauty of line and an ad - mirable adjustment of contrasts in the blacks and whites .

		Such drawings as the Dance of the Graces ,
Diana	PERSON	's Bath , and
Nature	ORGANIZATION	and Mutability , possess also originality and a rich imaginative grace .

		They are in harmony with the lovely poem they ornament ; and if occasionally they seem too sophisticated for its simplicity , it is , after all , a subtlety appropriate to the poet 's imagination .

		They are serious and sincere in feeling , and exquisitely decorative in treatment .

		The edition is limited to one thousand copies on unbleached hand-made paper , and twenty - eight on Japanese vellum .

		It has been issued in sections , all of which are now out .

		The edition of the same poem published in
London	LOCATION	by
J. M. Dent & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and imported by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is also sumptuous , but it has not the rare harmonious beauty of the other .

		The two bulky volumes are of an awkward size , and are yet too small for decora - tions so elaborate .

		The artist is Mr.
Louis Fairfax Muckley	PERSON	; but his work resembles that of
William Morris	PERSON	, much coarsened and weakened .

		The books from the
Kelmscott	LOCATION	press have a beauty of their own , but it will not bear imitation .

		Without sin - cerity and appropriateness , without originality of thought and fertility of invention , such work is a dim and meaningless echo .

		The decorative use of contrasts , the effective balance of light and shade , are problems unsolved by this draftsman .

		In his effort to be decorative , he is merely empty and stilted , and his simplicity is not the lovely and joy - ous simplicity of Spenser .

		There is a blatant quality in the work which is foreign to the poet 's sponta - neity , which the occasional bad drawing and the complicated decorative motives do not help to con - ceal .

		The book is furnished with a critical Intro - duction , the English of which is itself open to criticism , by Mr.
John W. Hales	PERSON	,
M.A.	LOCATION	, professor of English literature at
King 's College	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	.

		The edition is limited to 1,350 copies .


William Morris	PERSON	has much to answer for in these holiday books .

		Mr.
W. B. Macdougall	PERSON	, the artist who decorated '' The Fall of the Nibelungs '' -LRB- Dent -
Macmillan	PERSON	-RRB- , has studied his work too superficially .

		That kind of illustration is only justified by being done extremely well ; and no such excuse can be offered for the pictures in this book .

		It seems as though one page of
William Morris	PERSON	would have given a designer more ideas than are displayed in all these drawings .

		The fine old myths are '' done into English '' by Miss
Margaret Armour	PERSON	, who calls her work a '' plain prose rendering . ''

		Nevertheless her prose is elaborately archaic , her effort to bring it close to the original resulting in much that is artificial and stilted .

		Such English can not be natural to us moderns , and sincerity and simplicity , even a certain naivete , are its necessary ingredients .

		A rendering in modern English , if it were written with ability , with a kind of poetic sympathy , would be much nearer the original than these archaisms .

		But one could forgive the writer if her prose were beau - tiful .

		It has no music , no rhythm .

		She has used
Simrock	ORGANIZATION	's arrangement of the text , and the stories themselves are always interesting .

		They differ much , however , from the familiar Wagnerian ver - sion .

		The paper and print of the book are excellent .

		1897 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 839 The Arthurian legends , also , are given a new interpretation .

		In ''
King Arthur	PERSON	and the Table Bound '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , the tales are taken chiefly from the old French of Crestien of
Troyes	LOCATION	, whose fame has only recently been resurrected .

		They are trans - lated and edited with notes by Mr.
William Wells Newell	PERSON	, who has written also an introduction deal - ing with the history of Arthurian romance and the variations it has undergone in passing from hand to hand .

		He finds it to be , '' not only in style and decora - tion , but also in idea and outline , '' of French con - struction . ''

		Their virtues , '' he says , '' are nearly the opposites of qualities which would have found favor in British antiquity . ''

		To Crestien of Troyes he ascribes the merit of largely inventing these ro - mances and of giving them color and beauty .

		In comparison with his version , he thinks that all others have their points of weakness and ineffectiveness .

		He regrets that
Tennyson	PERSON	did not have access to it , and shows where he has altered the matter of the original legends and their spirit .

		One of the most conspicuous changes was in the character of
Gawain	PERSON	, who in the old romance was the very essence of chivalry .

		The end of the story of Launcelot and Guinevere is also very different in the '' Idylls of the
King	PERSON	, '' and
Arthur	PERSON	's prophetic knowledge of his fate and his moralizing over it were unknown to the earlier version .

		Tennyson , however , made no pre - tense of accuracy , and any interpretation of such stories is inevitably colored by the personality of the poet .

		As Mr.
Newell	PERSON	relates them , they are extremely interesting .

		His prose is simple and dignified , and , except for an occasional brusqueness , interprets the beauty of the old stories sufficiently well .

		He uses no flourishes nor ornament , leaving the poetry that lies in the structure of the tales to speak for itself .

		The two volumes are well printed and effectively bound in gray and white .

		A third edition , embellished with twenty-four finely executed photogravure illustrations , of
Herr Bernhard Berenson	PERSON	's admirable book on '' The Venetian Painters of the Renaissance '' is published by Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .


Herr Berenson	PERSON	's appreciations of the great Venetians and the beau - ties and peculiarities of their school are luminous and penetrating , and altogether worthy of their present sumptuous setting .

		A useful feature is the well compiled Index to the paintings of the leading Venetian artists , wherein , we are glad to note , doubt - ful attributions are clearly and unsparingly indicated .

		The text is handsomely printed on high-class paper , and the work forms altogether one of the most elegant and substantial gift-books on our list .

		It is nearly fifty years since Mrs.
Jonathan Fos	PERSON	- ter 's translation of
Vasari	PERSON	's '' Lives of the Painters '' was published ; and though a volume of notes was added to it by Dr.
Richter	PERSON	in
1885	DATE	, the new edition of the work issued by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons is the first attempt to annotate the lives with the results of modern criticism .

		The past twenty years have seen a remarkable revival of interest in Italian art , and the many critics it has evoked have made important changes in our knowledge of the lives and works of the artists .

		The editors ,
Messrs. E. H. and E. W. Blashfield	PERSON	and
A. A. Hopkins	PERSON	, in their admirable preface , say that '' art literature has passed through its ages of faith , of personal inspira - tion , and has now entered into its age of inquiry . ''

		Their summary of the method and results of mod - ern research is concise and lucid , showing the revo - lutionary theories of the '' detective school '' of criticism and the changes it has made in the repu - tations of several painters .

		Nothing that
Morelli	PERSON	has touched remains quite the same .

		We may object to his intensely material system of identification , but we are obliged to accept its results nevertheless .

		This preface indicates , also , the mistakes that
Vasari	PERSON	has been discovered to have made in the characters of certain painters , and it shows especially how much
Filippo Lippi	PERSON	,
Andrea del Sarto	PERSON	and Perugino have gained in honor through the single-minded , devoted work of scholars .

		All of these changes are empha - sized and elaborated in the copious and well-written notes , which also identify some '' lost '' pictures and give much information in regard to the present location of works of art described by
Vasari	PERSON	.

		The work has been done in the most careful and thor - ough manner consistent with an untechnical com - mentary upon the text .

		In order that the material might be compressed into four volumes without abbreviating the notes , seventy of the most interest - ing and important of the biographies were selected , those less valuable to the public , and even to the student , being omitted .

		There are other books for other art enthusiasts .

		`` Sunlight and Shadow '' -LRB-
Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is designed for photographers .

		Those who have passed their novitiate and wish to do serious work with the camera are expected to profit by it .

		The editor , Mr.
W. I. Lincoln Adams	PERSON	, has collected , from vari - ous journals of photography , papers on such ad - vanced subjects as lighting , grouping , the choice of subject , marines , and night pictures .

		They are written by different experts , who thus give the ama - teur the benefit of their special experiences .

		Beauty of style , however , was not considered in making the selection , and photographers must be guiltless of a sense of humor .

		It is interesting to learn , for ex - ample , that '' the introduction of appropriate skies is of prime importance in landscape '' ; and we rather like to be assured that `` for a rugged mountain scene we do not want the calm and serene . ''

		The book is a little too advanced for the beginner and too elementary for the expert .

		The artist will not learn much from suggestions which are either ob - vious or too cut-and-dried .

		The technical informa - tion about the camera itself and its relation to its subject are useful ; but for anything beyond that , the student should study rather the great princi - ples of art .

		The book is a quarto , illustrated with many good photographs , some of which are also artistic .

		De la Motte Fouqu ^ 's '' Undine '' is reprinted by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	, with illustrations and decorative 340 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, designs by Miss
Rosie M. M. Pitman	PERSON	.

		They are charm - ing , these drawings , very decorative and very fanci - ful .

		In many of them the artist 's imagination seems to have entered into that of the writer , so sympathet - ically does she express the weird loveliness of the story .

		Even in her handling of line in the exquisite little head-pieces , one finds a touch of the unearthly .

		There is much symbolism in the pictures , so much , indeed , that the artist prints descriptions of them in the index .

		They are unnecessary , however , for most of the drawings have a beauty of their own , inde - pendent of such hidden meaning .

		And symbolism , to be justified , should explain itself without literary assistance .

		But the artist does suggest the delicate beauty of the allegory .

		An odd little book that is likely to arrest the attention of those in quest of a simple gift for a young friend is Mr.
H. J. Burlingame	PERSON	's `` Herrmann the Magician '' -LRB-
Laird & Lee	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Besides a lively sketch of the two
Herrmanns	ORGANIZATION	,
Carl	PERSON	and
Alexander	PERSON	, and a well written introductory chapter on the `` Psychology of the Art of Conjuring , '' it contains a clear explanation , with cuts , of the best tricks per - formed by the Herrmanns and some other noted `` wizards . ''

		As the author of this portion of the book is himself an inventor and maker of conjuring apparatus , he may be presumed to know intimately whereof he speaks .

		It may be noted that while some of the feats described are very difficult and only to be accomplished with the aid of expensive and cumbersome apparatus , there are many others that , while astounding enough to spectators , are comparatively easy of execution and therefore suited to parlor entertainments .

		The explanations of such famous stage illusions as the '' Rabbit Trick , '' the `` Vanishing Lady , '' the `` Magi 's Wand , '' the `` Decapitation Trick '' and so on , should prove in - teresting to the thousands who have been mystified by them .

		The sketch of the
Herrmanns	ORGANIZATION	, especially of
Alexander Herrmann	PERSON	, whose Mephistophelian look greatly belied his genial and singularly chari - table heart , is very racy and well leavened with stories of the half-impromptu tricks which the con - jurers were so fond of playing off at odd times and places at the expense of all sorts of people .

		The book is prettily bound in canary-colored
Holliston	LOCATION	cloth , and contains a number of plates , including a late portrait of
Alexander Herrmann	PERSON	.

		In his `` Gondola Days '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr.
F. Hopkinson Smith	PERSON	rhapsodizes acceptably , albeit much in the old familar vein , about
Venice	LOCATION	and the Venetians .

		If the somewhat pass & e Queen of the
Adriatic	LOCATION	showed herself to Mr.
Smith	PERSON	precisely as he depicts her , he is certainly an enviable travel - ler .

		To own a pair of eyes like his , capable of transforming so much squalor into splendor , of see - ing a worthy relative of the `` tuneful gondolier '' of yore in the swart tatterdemalion who nowadays sculls you about in his aquatic hearse , and so on , would be worth while .

		Mr.
Smith	PERSON	makes no attempt to review the glories of Venetian history or to probe present problems .

		His treatment of his theme is picturesque and sentimental , and there is a due leaven of humor .

		For one sojourning for a time in
Venice	LOCATION	the book would form an entertaining and a suggestive , and in a small way an informing , com - panion .

		There are a dozen slight but effective drawings , and the volume is neatly made .

		The Putnams issue , in attractive holiday garb ,
Edmondo de Amicis	PERSON	' lively and piquant account of his experiences on an Italian liner , entitled '' On Blue Water . ''

		The volume contains some 300 pages , and there are 60 drawings , full-page and vignette , of good quality .

		In the text , the witty and eloquent Italian traveller exploits the humors of his fellow - passengers on the ''
Galileo	ORGANIZATION	'' in a very amusing way , and introduces to his American readers some very unfamiliar , not to say grotesque , types .

		The des - criptions are so graphic that the reader begins to feel after a chapter or so quite as if he were '' on blue water '' himself , and listening to the chat of this most delightful of literary compagnons du voyage .

		One of the most substantial of the season 's books is '' Bird Neighbors '' -LRB-
Doubleday & McClure Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Miss Neltje Blanchan .

		It is furnished with an introduction by Mr.
John Burroughs	PERSON	, who vouches for the accuracy of the work in this science in which his word is final .

		The author has not attempted a profound study of the subject ; her object is rather to furnish a guide for the uninitiated and the ama - teur .

		She writes of one hundred and fifty of our most frequent feathery visitors , classifying them first by color , and describing clearly and briefly their tricks and manners .

		Her talk about them has vivacity and charm , and shows that she knows her world not only with the head , but with the heart .

		To each little life she gives character and individu - ality .

		The value of the book is greatly heightened by the colored plates , many of which are surpris - ingly beautiful .

		With their help it would be easy to identify most of the flying creatures we see about us .

		To a friend of pronounced `` bibliomaniacal '' ten - dencies , no Christmas gift could be more acceptable than a copy of Mr.
Irving Browne	PERSON	's '' In the Track of the Book - Worm , '' published by the Roycroft Printing Shop , of
East Aurora	LOCATION	, N. Y .

		Mr.
Browne	PERSON	is a veteran book-collector and extra-illustrator , and his pleasantly-written volume of '' thoughts , fancies , and gentle gibes on collecting and collectors '' makes interesting reading .

		The numerous verses on `` book - ish '' subjects scattered throughout the volume are especially good .

		Like all previous products of the
Roycroft Press	ORGANIZATION	, the volume is mechanically a beauti - ful specimen of book-making , and we predict that the limited edition in which it is issued will soon be exhausted .

		A new edition of '' Irish Idylls '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- is illus - trated with many reproductions of photographs and drawings by Mr.
Clifton Johnson	PERSON	, which serve to prove the accuracy of Miss
Jane Barlow	PERSON	's descrip - tions of the desolate life of the
Connemara	LOCATION	boglands .

		The pictures have some of the quaint charm of the stories , and they give definiteness to our ideas of the bogs and the villages that '' forbidding environ -
1897	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 341 ment '' of an unhappy people , which has yet a beauty of its own .

		The cover , by Mr.
George Wharton Edwards	PERSON	, is good , though the names of the separate stories seem an unnecessary and unimaginative adornment .

		There is also a well-printed new edition of '' The Maiden and
Married Life of Mary Powell	ORGANIZATION	'' -LRB- after - wards Mistress Milton -RRB- , and the sequel thereto , ''
Deborah	PERSON	's Diary '' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- .

		The volume is prettily illustrated by Mr.
John Jellicoe	PERSON	and Mr.
Herbert Railton	PERSON	, and the drawings give charming glimpses of the picturesqueness of old
London	LOCATION	.

		An introduction by the Rev.
W. H. Hutton	PERSON	,
B.D.	LOCATION	, tells something about the personality of Miss
Manning	PERSON	, who wrote the book , and reviews briefly the historical facts upon which it is based .

		Mr.
Hutton	PERSON	would have been wiser to confine himself to such facts , for when he launches into criticism he compares
Milton	PERSON	as a religious poet , much to his disadvantage , with
Christina Rossetti	PERSON	.

		The novel itself is a plausible and charming explanation of the vagaries of the poet 's domestic life .

		Another attractive reprint is ''
Pomona	LOCATION	's Travels '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , by Mr.
Frank R. Stockton	PERSON	, whose name alone carries a laugh with it .

		There is humor , also , in the delightful pictures by Mr.
A. B. Frost	PERSON	, which have almost as much character as the story .

		The cover , in buff and green , relieved with a touch of black , is very attractive ; and as the work itself is one of the happiest things that even Mr.
Stockton	PERSON	's fancy has conceived , everything makes for its success .

		A popular addition of '' The Adventures of Mr.
Verdant Green	PERSON	, an Oxford Freshman '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Cuthbert Bede	PERSON	,
B.A.	LOCATION	, will appeal to collegians of the past and the future .

		There are innumerable illustrations by the author , badly drawn but clever and amusing nevertheless .

		They are colloquial , like the text , and very English .

		Miss
Anna Fuller	PERSON	's '' Pratt Portraits '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is also given a new setting .

		It is characterized by wide margins , good paper and print , a common - place cover , and a series of portrait drawings by Mr.
George Sloane	PERSON	, which show some cleverness and much appreciation of the significance of the text .

		Other reprints are two in the pretty '' Thumb-Nail Series '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB-
Cicero	PERSON	's '' De Amicitia , '' translated by
Benjamin E. Smith	PERSON	, and
Dickens	PERSON	's `` Christmas Carol , '' each well bound in stamped leather and illustrated with a good frontispiece in tint ; and one of an essay by Mrs.
Anna Robertson Brown	PERSON	, '' What is Worth While ? ''

		-LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , effectively printed in heavy black type on excellent paper .

		Music lovers and students will be interested in The Story of the Harp '' -LRB-
Lyon & Healy	ORGANIZATION	,
Chicago	LOCATION	-RRB- , which gives a history of that instrument from an - cient times to the present , illustrated with pictures of the harp at the various stages of its development , and with half-tone portraits of famous harpists .

		Several books of selections are on the holiday tables , and the finest of them is emphatically the volume of
Wordsworth	PERSON	edited by Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	-LRB- Longmans -RRB- .

		It is neatly bound in blue cloth , stamped with a good design in gold ; and the illustrations and delicate initials by Mr.
Alfred Par	PERSON	- sons are charming .

		The selections are from the shorter and more familiar of the poems , the most spontaneous and least didactic of the poet 's work .

		The introduction emphasizes the fact that `` what is truly great in his poetry is independent of his theory , and may almost be called independent of his con - scious reasoning self . ''

		The editor 's attitude is not one of sympathy with his author 's theories , nor even tolerance of them , but this does not blind him to the beauty of some of his work .

		`` The Lovers '
Shak	PERSON	- spere '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , compiled by Mrs.
Chloe Blake	PERSON	- man Jones , is what the title indicates , a collection of quotations pertaining to the various phases of love .

		They are carefully selected , adroitly grouped , and daintily decorated .

		Mrs.
Helen Kendrick Johnson	PERSON	has collected some '' Short Sayings of Famous Men '' and published them in two small volumes -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		The sayings are grouped in a rather hap-hazard fashion under various head - ings .

		The title of one of these sections , '' Wis - dom , '' is scarcely complimentary to the authors of selections outside of it . ''

		The Ayrshire Homes and Haunts of Burns '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , by Mr.
Henry C. Shelley	PERSON	, is bound in a charming thistle-deco - rated cover , and contains a number of interesting photographic illustrations .

		There is also the `` Ian
Maclaren	PERSON	Year - Book '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- , with a quotation for each day in the year , thus giving one a fine oppor - tunity to duly consider and repent of any undue fondness for this Scotchman . ''

		The Chatelaine '' -LRB-
Peter Paul Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by
G. E. X.	PERSON	, is a collection of small observations upon large topics , printed each upon a separate page ; but even in this rivulet of text , words are more plentiful than ideas .

		One feels too much the struggle for an originality which is achieved neither in thought nor expression .

		`` An Alphabet '' -LRB-
R. H. Russell	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr.
William Nicholson	PERSON	, is too original and too clever to be given up entirely to children , much as they will enjoy it .

		It is a series of delightful character-studies , drawn in masses of black on light brown , with an occasional dash of color .

		The artist expresses a great deal with very few and very broad strokes of the brush ; and a grim sort of humor is everywhere evident .

		A number of calendars have been issued for the coming year .

		The ''
Frederic Remington	PERSON	Calendar '' -LRB-
Russell	PERSON	-RRB- is made up of a few selections , less care - fully printed , from a book already reviewed .

		`` A Coon Calendar '' -LRB-
Russell	PERSON	-RRB- contains some of Mr.
Kemble	PERSON	's clever drawings of pickaninnies , printed in color .

		The `` Sports and Seasons Calendar '' -LRB-
Russell	PERSON	-RRB- also printed in color , illustrates golfing , driving , and kindred subjects , with a good deal of cleverness .

		In addition , we find a `` Shakespeare Kalendar '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- , printed on large sheets with a quotation for every day , `` Ian
Maclaren Calen	PERSON	- dar '' -LRB-
Dodd	PERSON	-RRB- for thooe who wish to be sentimental all the year round , and a pretty '' Calendar of Purple Flowers '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , from designs by
Paul de Longpre	ORGANIZATION	'' .

		342 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, BOOKS FOB THE YOUNG .

		L The supply of children 's books shows no diminution from year to year , and the quality of them changes but little .

		Occasionally there is an encouraging sign of progress in the direction of wholesomeness aiid vigor , but it does not conceal the many evidences of weakness , of snobbishness , of the worship of false gods .

		The fate of the little children who have to walk through a world so commonplace or so perverted is enough to excite sympathy .

		The joy of filling out the incomplete old nursery rhymes , of dreaming over the labyrinthine paths to fairyland , is never theirs .

		Out of these scores of books , barely half a dozen give the imagination a chance to grow .

		Most of them ignore the existence of such a quality of the mind .

		There is a mad search for facts , when impossibilities , if they have but a spark of humanity in them , are much more beneficial .

		Facts , as they are dressed up for children , are apt to be entirely false .

		Stories of good little school-girls and bad little boys who run away and join the Indians can not make up for the absence of the good old fairy tales , which con - tain something true and genuine , something which has answered to the needs of generations of happy children .

		Mr.
Harry Thurston Peck	PERSON	, in a recent essay , looks for - ward to a '' Renaissance of the
Natural	ORGANIZATION	, when they will no more be fed with formulas and made to learn so many improving things . ''

		We are not in need of formulas here in
America	LOCATION	; even brought up as we have been on ''
Jack	PERSON	and the
Beanstalk	LOCATION	, '' and the others , an excess of fancy is not one of our faults .

		So that if we are given only practical commonplaces to digest , the imagination is in danger of death from inanition .

		The Juvenile book of the year , one of the most original and beautiful of many years , is that in which
M. Boutet de Monvel	PERSON	, in a series of colored pictures , gives his con - ception of the personality of ''
Joan	PERSON	of Arc '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- The text is a brief and simple story of the life of this '' humble peasant girl who is the Patroness of
France	LOCATION	, who is the Saint of her country as she was its Martyr . ''

		It is told without flourishes , which could only injure its exalted beauty .

		But the pictures are eloquent of the child 's simplicity , her singleness of purpose , her self-sacrificing devotion and loyalty , and the purity of her exaltation .

		With all these qualities the artist shows the most exquisite and tender sympathy .

		From the first drawing , where she is merely the simple , ignor - ant , industrious peasant-girl , to that one where she stands , clear-sighted and ennobled , the accuser of her worldly judges , he understands her and he makes us understand her .

		The simplicity and spirituality of this slender little creature , as we see her in these pictures , are never open to question .

		Around her , the color and movement are shown with rare and wonderful art .

		Every line , every harmony of tint , is made to help in the expression of the emotion of the moment .

		The color reaches its climax of brilliancy in the sumptuous scene of the coronation , and darkens into sombreness as the tragedy advances .

		There is fine decorative feeling in the arrangement of line and color , and the characterization is admirable .

		It would be difficult to say too much in praise of these beautiful drawings , which the artists at the last Salon of the Champs de Mars were wise enough to honor with a separate room .

		For this
Christmas	DATE	, the department of history receives more than the usual attention , and the prevailing res - pect for facts requires that it be given due consideration .

		Such stories are among the most useful and interesting , though the writers too often confound fact with truth .

		The composition of a fine true story requires as much imagination as the writing of fiction .

		And in the one case , as in the other , the real value depends upon the way it is done .

		Nevertheless , an inferior historical tale is more tolerable than a weak invented one .

		Among these books , dealing more or less directly with history , there are some very good stories . ''

		The Century Book of the American Revolution '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Elbridge S. Brooks	PERSON	, adopts an ingenious method of con - necting the events of other days with our own life .

		Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	carries a party of boys and girls over the ground made historic by the great war , telling the noble story of its conflicts almost entirely in dialogue .

		It is not an easy task to keep freedom and sparkle and crispness through such conversation between a friendly and well - informed uncle and several lively boys and girls .

		And Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	succeeds in it fairly well .

		Occasionally the talk is stiff and unnatural , but he manages to give it variety and light-heartedness and to save the uncle from pedantry .

		The plan enables him also to tell many of the intimate little stories of the war , which would come in less naturally in a more ambitious narrative .

		And he awakens a keen interest in the places where the battles were fought and their character and development .

		It brings one in touch a little with the ideas and emotions which served to arouse a nation .

		The book is illustrated with innumerable drawings and photographs which greatly increase its value .

		It is not the only one which deals with the Revolution . ''


Washington	LOCATION	's Young Aids '' -LRB-
W. A. Wilde & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Everett T. Tomlinson	PERSON	, centres in the
New Jersey	LOCATION	campaign .

		It is the story of two boys who render effective service as scouts and mes - sengers .

		The author tries to be accurate , but the prob - abilities are not always considered .

		It is not the brains of his heroes which help them out of their adventures .

		It is a tame recital of stirring events ; and the author has so little knowledge of character that one seems to be looking on at a puppet-play '' The Boys of
Fort Schuy	LOCATION	- ler '' -LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr.
James Otis	PERSON	, is the same kind of tale about a different part of the same war ; but the workmanship is much better .

		Here too , however , the situations are not always convincing , and commanders seem to take foolish and unnecessary risks .

		But there is some spirit in the book , and the characters are indi - vidualized and differentiated .

		The young hero carries important messages through the enemy 's lines and issues triumphant from many a dangerous exploit .

		His is courage in a good cause , and will be stimulating to the boys of our quieter days .

		The pictures are mediocre , but the cover has originality .

		The same writer is res - ponsible for a story of
Boston	LOCATION	during the siege , which is called '' The Signal Boys of '75 '' -LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- .

		In this he has a more unusual subject , and one in which the work of boys seems more appropriate .

		It is a simple little story of terror and treachery contrasted with bravery and devotion , and the writer has told it without flourishes or unnecessary ornamentation .

		He makes one feel the beauty of the stanch little characters .

		The pictures also have individuality More stirring , more full of action , is the contribution to the story of the Revolution made by Mr.
William O. Stoddard	PERSON	, one of the most interest - ing of the writers for boys .

		Its title , '' The Red Patriot , '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- , indicates the important part played by an Indian in the thrilling drama .

		But the real heroes are , nevertheless , a boy and a horse .

		The one is as brave as the other , and together they do good service for the
1897	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 343 great cause .

		Better than that , too , they are both very much alive ; we are made to believe in them and sym - pathize with them .

		The story moves and the interest is skilfully maintained .

		A boy who carries important des - patches through ominous dangers , and yet abhors shoes and stockings , will not appeal in vain to the heart of the American youth .

		Mr.
James Barnes	PERSON	carries one down to the War of
1812	DATE	, in his latest book .

		Its hero is '' Commodore Bainbridge '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- , and the author has had special opportunities of learning the facts of this commander 's successful career .

		He tells the spirited story with dash and brilliancy , vivifying the personality of a vigorous and able seaman and a born commander .

		His is a suc - cess won by fearlessness , readiness , and persistence , a success in which character meant even more than ability .

		The story has variety , morever , and pictur - esqueness , for the
Commodore	ORGANIZATION	's adventures are of many kinds and his ships sail in many waters .

		The War of the Rebellion is also given a share of attention by our historians for the young .

		With this conflict as a basis , Mr.
William Henry Shelton	PERSON	devises a curious plot in '' The Last Three Soldiers '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		This remnant of the great army is a signal-corps stationed at the top of a lonely mountain .

		The next signal-station is captured by the Confederates , who send false messages about the defeat of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	forces .

		Deceived by this information , the three soldiers volun - tarily exile themselves in their retreat , and for seven years they remain in ignorance of the issue of the war .

		Their life is not without incident , however , and bears and precipices and buried gold are conspicuous factors in the story .

		Impossible situations are given a certain color of probability , but the author goes far to seek his adventure .

		He has no imagination to give it life and charm .

		Mr.
W. J. Henderson	PERSON	shows rather more of this quality in '' The Last Cruise of the Mohawk '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , enough to give his seamen a little individu - ality .

		But the school-life at the beginning is most un - promising , and there is more than a touch of absurdity in the strained and obvious characterization .

		The vil - lains have a curious tendency to reform in the last chapter .

		Some of the descriptions of sea-fights with Farragut , however , move swiftly and excitedly .

		The same subject and period are dealt with in '' Midshipman Jack '' -LRB-
W. A. Wilde & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Charles Ledyard Norton	PERSON	; and the same battle , where Admiral Farragut dauntlessly led his ships over the terrible torpedo line , forms the centre and climax of the story .

		It is told more soberly , but more clearly , than the last .

		There is less fighting in this book than in the other , and it drags more .

		Mr.
William O. Stoddard	PERSON	has gone back to the begin - ning of the conflict with
Mexico	LOCATION	for his war-story , '' The Lost Gold of the Montezumas '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- ; and he could hardly find a more picturesque subject than the defense of the
Alamo	LOCATION	.

		The story has
Davy Crockett	PERSON	and Colonel Bowie for its heroes , and the fall of the
Alamo	LOCATION	, so superbly defended , for its climax .

		The writer does not make the most of his fine opportunity ; he does not make the siege a real , living , vital , stir - ring thing .

		But even a part of such a truth is worth having .

		Two other American history books antedate the Revo - lution . ''

		The Young Puritans of Old Hadley '' -LRB-
Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mrs.
Mary P. Wells Smith	PERSON	, is an attempt to describe the life of Puritan children in one of the early
Massa	PERSON	- chusetts settlements .

		The author has studied her sub - ject carefully , and the picture of this life , extinct yet still blood of our blood and bone of our bone , has un - usual interest .

		The work is well done , with many de - tails which increase its vividness , and it makes one rejoice that the difficulties and fears of the rigid little Puritans are not bothering the children of to-day .

		Mr.
Hezekiah Butterworth	PERSON	's new book , `` True to his Home '' -LRB- Apple - ton -RRB- , is also founded on colonial life .

		It relates to the boyhood of
Franklin	PERSON	, and carries on the story of his life to the end .

		It is a great life , in its sim - plicity and sincerity as well as in its achievements , and it is a good thing for the American youth to know of it .

		In Mr.
Butterworth	PERSON	's way of describing it , there is nothing pedantic or labored , and the moralizing is not too much in evidence .

		He has made it interesting to boys and girls , this story which is so much quieter and so much finer than that of warriors .

		Only four of these semi-historical books deal with other countries , which indicates the extent of patriotism among our youth .

		Two of these relate to
England	LOCATION	, one to
Germany	LOCATION	, and the other goes back to the fall of
Carth	LOCATION	- age .

		The Rev.
Alfred J. Church	PERSON	writes the latter , and calls it '' Lords of the World '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		The author 's style is rather stiff , and the story does not move with the swiftness which seems necessary to the subject .

		Yet it is handled with dignity and with some ingenuity , and the narrative is interesting enough to overcome some heaviness in the method .

		No history is more romantic than that of
Carthage	LOCATION	, and one only wishes that the im - agination which can resurrect dead cities and peoples could also vivify them .

		The illustrations , by
Ralph Peacock	PERSON	, are good .

		The German story is one of Mr.
Henty	PERSON	's , and is called `` With Frederick the Great '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		Mr.
Henty	PERSON	is the one of these writers who best understands his world , and can handle his material in such a way as to keep the absorbed attention of his boys .

		His descriptions of battles have spontaneity and dash about them , which bring his readers into the fight - ing army .

		In this book he tries to give an impression of the course of the Seven Years ' War , and his youthful hero rises , through many distinguished exploits , to the rank of colonel in the service of Frederick the Great .

		Another story of war -LRB- on the sea this time , and the sea seems to be popular this year -RRB- is '' The Golden Gal - leon '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , by Mr.
Robert Leighton	PERSON	.

		In his pre - face the author says that he has '' tried to represent some of the conditions of life ashore and afloat in the glorious days of Queen Elizabeth . ''

		His historical basis is Lord
Thomas Howard	PERSON	's expedition against the West Indian treasure-ships , and upon it he builds a lively and exciting story .

		Mr.
Leighton	PERSON	has a good and spirited style , which does not allow the story to grow tame or the interest to flag .

		Drusilla 's letter is a pretty bit of courtly writing .

		The other English book deals with '' The Knights of the Round Table '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , a subject always attractive and romantic .

		This version is written by Mr.
William Henry Frost	PERSON	, who professes himself an admirer of Ma - lory , and yet does not hesitate to reduce
Malory	PERSON	's tales to dull prose .

		Any boy intelligent enough to enjoy these tales at all would like them infinitely better as
Malory	ORGANIZATION	tells them ; and the idea that such stories must be speci - ally written out in a b c language to suit the childish taste is nonsense .

		Children have as much feeling for the beauty of words as their elders ; and
Malory	PERSON	's rhyth - mic , sonorous phrases appeal to their imagination .

		Such sumptuous raiment is necessary to clothe these stately tales , and an appreciation of its appropriateness is not reserved for us alone .

		We believe too little in the in - 844 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, telligence of children , and we continue too long giving them food for babes .

		Those are quieter stories which Mr.
W. H. Rideing	PERSON	has to offer in the new edition of `` The Boyhood of Famous Authors '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		But it must be confessed that the little he has found to say about the boyhood of such men as
Holmes	LOCATION	,
Trowbridge	PERSON	,
Howells	PERSON	and
Whittier	LOCATION	makes rather dull reading .

		Aldrich and
Stevenson	PERSON	have told their own stories with infinitely better effect , as Mr.
Rideing	PERSON	would be the first to recognize .

		Stockton and
Stedman	PERSON	,
Boyesen	PERSON	and Kipling , furnish some picturesque material ; but if their entire lives were embraced in the sketches , even children would find them more interesting .

		Two good examples of the happy use of the historic imagination in re-creating the life of a by-gone time are Miss
Imogen Clark	PERSON	's '' Will Shakespeare 's Little Lad '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- and Mr.
John Bennett	PERSON	's '' Master Sky - lark '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The '' little lad '' of
Miss Clark	PERSON	's story is of course
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's son Hamnet , twin brother of the
Judith	PERSON	whose delightful picture has been given us by Mr.
William Black	PERSON	in his ''
Judith Shakes	PERSON	- peare , '' one of the best historical novels ever written .

		Although this story of Hamnet is designed for younger readers , and the author 's art is inferior to the older writer 's , it is nevertheless a pleasant '' all feigned though true '' representation of the home life of the
Arden	LOCATION	,
Hathaway	PERSON	, and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	families .

		Master Skylark of Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	's story is a
Stratford	LOCATION	boy of the six - teenth century , who , falling upon hard places in
London	LOCATION	, seeks the aid of bis fellow-townsman , and finds him true to
Ben Jonson	PERSON	's description , the '' gentle Shakes - peare . ''

		Books of this nature are enjoyable in propor - tion to previous knowledge of the atmosphere and situation ; hence the elders of the household will in some cases like them even more than the children , while the illustrations of both volumes are artistic enough to attract eyes of whatever age .

		Among the writers of pure fiction for children , there is one who has only to speak to be eagerly and affection - ately listened to . ''

		Once the White-Haired Master '' in his latest book `` said to Little Crochet , They all love you because you are good , my son . '

		But Little Crotchet was quick to reply : Oh , no , father ; it is n't that .

		It 's because I am fond of them ! ' ''

		And this is also the ex - planation of Mr.
Joel Chandler Harris	PERSON	's hold upon the children .

		For every living thing he has a kindness , and his sympathy is intuitive and exquisitely delicate .

		One feels it from the first page to the last of '' Aaron in the Wildwoods '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , this deep understanding of life , and the deeper reverence for its beauty and even for its imperfections .

		In him the love of things fine and noble never implies harshness or cruelty to those creatures that are themselves harsh and cruel .

		Nothing is uninteresting to him ; no character is too trivial for him to illuminate it .

		His books are too fine to be re - served entirely for children , yet they are never raised above a child 's intelligence .

		It is only that their sim - plicity is subtle and their subtlety is given the color of simplicity .

		This latest book tells us the story of Aaron the runaway negro and Little Crochet , the cripple who dashes through the woods and swamps on his
Gray Pony	ORGANIZATION	.

		We can afford to throw aside the histories for a time for the sake of the good honest truth and beauty which lie deep in the heart of such a book as this .

		In '' Captains Courageous '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr.
Rud	PERSON	- yard Kipling has written a fresh , breezy , bracing sort of story of the Grand Banks .

		Its hero is the spoiled and conceited son of a
California	LOCATION	millionaire , who in a sudden fit of illness falls off the deck of an ocean liner .

		He is picked up by one of the crew of the fishing schooner '' We 're Here '' ; and on that little boat he receives his first lessons in hard work and in manliness .

		His stories about his father 's drags and private cars are looked upon as fairy tales , and for several months during the fishing on the banks he is one of the crew .

		He adjusts himself to the situation with boyish alacrity and a boyish love of novelty , and it gives him a new attitude towards life .

		It is easy to justify Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	in his theory that such a revolutionary experience would be a permanently healthful influence in a boy 's career .

		He fell in with good fellows , he worked hard , and he came into close contact with the elements : three things that make for righteous - ness .

		Yet the hero is his least successful character , much less alive than the fishermen , whose life is pre - sented with extraordinary vividness .

		The breath of the sea is in the book , and the men who live upon it are individualized sharply , but on simple lines , without in - tricacy or subtlety .

		We know them through and through , as we listen with a kind of amused unconcern to their idle talk .

		We lose sight at once of the author ; he seems to be no part of his book , so completely do the characters act out their own story .

		It is a remarkable imagination that can so absorb itself in unfamiliar surroundings .

		Yet the story drags at times ; and at the end , though the author is wise enough to keep the millionaire from act - ing as special providence when he finds his son , there is rather too much talk about money and the things that money can do .

		If it were not for the latter defect , however , we would miss the fine description of the race of the '' lightning special '' across the continent , and the interesting commentary upon the American man of affairs .

		This sketch indicates that Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	should give us a more serious and complete picture of this type , that '' story of the New West , whose story is yet to be written . ''

		There are brilliant , illuminating phrases and paragraphs here and there in the book , but they make one wish that the author would spend his time upon less transitory work .

		A new edition of Mr.
Charles Dudley Warner	PERSON	's '' Being a Boy '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- is welcome for the holi - days , though it is the kind of book which boys enjoy most after they are grown .

		It is half reminiscence and half biography , but it is wholly charming .

		It represents the life of the
New England	LOCATION	boy before the middle of the century , his pleasures and troubles being very much like those of the boy of to-day .

		It leaves one with the impression that the life of a country boy is a singularly happy one , in spite of the fact that he must '' work for his independence . ''

		Mr.
Warner	PERSON	carries one into this life with a delightful sympathy .

		He is still a boy at heart , and can still chuckle over his natural shortcom - ings and subterfuges .

		He good-naturedly lets one into the secrets of his life , but they are not very wicked secrets , and it might make the sternest parent more tolerant to read of them .

		This new edition after twenty years is illustrated with many charming realistic photo - graphs by Mr.
Clifton Johnson	PERSON	, photographs that show the real boy , wholesome and happy , at work and at play .

		In '' The Young Mountaineers '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by
Charles Egbert Craddock	PERSON	, there is a good deal of human nature .

		But here , too , it is of the kind that appeals to adults rather than to the young .

		The fact that '' Old Daddy '' rode three miles on a bad horse to tell his cronies of the great achievement of his son in seeing a '' harnt '' is delightful to us who are more or less sophisti -
1897	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 845 cated , but it would have no special charm for boys .

		And the clever analysis of boy-nature in '' Among the Cliffs '' is open to the same criticism .

		Yet this story is so original and so amusing that one does not care whether the boys like it or not . ''

		Way Down in Poor Valley '' is less convincing , and its hero seems unnaturally and too consciously heroic .

		The book has caught something of the spirit of the mountains , though some of the de - scriptions are a little strident .

		Ground even more unfamiliar is covered by Mr.
Hez	PERSON	- ekiah
Butterworth	PERSON	in '' Over the Andes '' -LRB-
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The author takes two boys and a girl , guided by the inevita - ble uncle , to
Buenos Ayres	PERSON	, and then across country and over the
Andes	LOCATION	to the western coast .

		It is a fine oppor - tunity to describe a rich and beautiful region , which , to the American youth , is much less familiar than the nations of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The place is a mine of romantic material , but Mr.
Butterworth	PERSON	only suggests its possi - bilities .

		The beauty of the region and its poetry are beyond his stilted style .

		Yet there is much information that may make the boys realize that the great countries to the south of us are not to be ignored .

		And the nar - rative is given variety by introducing certain stories connected with the history and heroes of
Brazil	LOCATION	and
Peru	LOCATION	. ''

		Paul
Travers	ORGANIZATION	's Adventures '' -LRB-
Way & Williams	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Sam T. Clover	PERSON	, embrace even a larger territory .

		In his search for experience , the boy-hero of the story starts off on a journey around the world , determined to pay his way .

		It is a story of the kind of pluck that is regarded as peculiarly American , but the boy 's meth - ods of securing money and transportation do not always indicate the highest sense of honor .

		He is a cheery , generous fellow , however , and his story is told crisply and in a vigorous style .

		The shipwreck , especially , is well done .

		There is a similar scene in '' The Beach Patrol '' -LRB-
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
William Drysdale	PERSON	, but it is written from the point of view of a boy in the life-saving ser - vice instead of one on the wreck .

		The rescue of the passengers makes an exciting narrative , and gives one an insight into the dangers of the service and the dar - ing required to meet them .

		The story has a dash and swing that will hold the attention of all boys who love courage .

		One is not encouraged to read a book for its style on learning in the opening sentence that '' one of the most wonderful landscapes of the world was outspread in every direction . ''

		Nevertheless , a description of '' The Painted Desert '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- is no easy thing to write , and when Mr.
Kirk Munroe	PERSON	gets beyond this and fairly into his story , his style improves .


Todd Chalmers	PERSON	, his hero , accompanies a scientific expedition into
Arizona	LOCATION	, and in the course of a deer-hunt loses his companions and finds himself alone in the Painted Desert .

		His en - counter there with some
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	hermits , and their subsequent exposure of two swindlers who attempt to '' salt '' the valley with diamonds , form the basis of a vig - orous and interesting story .

		The background , which is always kept in evidence , has a charm of its own ; and Mr.
Lungren	PERSON	's admirable drawings make it vivid where Mr.
Munroe	PERSON	's descriptions do not .

		We have a glimpse , though , of curious Indian customs , like the snake-dance .

		The work is cleverly constructed , and the author is ingenious in devising original and striking situations .

		Life in the far west attracts the authors of two other books . ''

		The Big-Horn Treasure '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , by Cap - tain
John F. Cargill	PERSON	, goes to the
Rocky Mountains	LOCATION	for a story of mining .

		In this , the hero -LRB- and it is curious that heroes always should be born fortunate -RRB- discovers , through the chance of an accidental
fall	DATE	, a rich vein of gold .

		Like all heroes , he at once appreciates the value of his discovery , and knows how to make the most of it and defend it from his enemies .

		He ultimately secures his millions , travels around the world , and lives happily ever after .

		The constant , complete , and overwhelming success of heroes becomes , however , a somewhat painful mystery after one has read a score or more of children 's books .

		One begins to long for an unlucky and improvi - dent hero , and to understand why boys should take to smoke and girls to tempers in order to escape the deadly monotony .

		It is rather a relief to come upon the quieter adven - tures of `` The King of the Park '' -LRB-
Crowell	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Marshall Saunders	PERSON	.

		The action takes place in civilized
Boston	LOCATION	, and '' King Boozy '' is a cat .

		The conspicuous place in the story , however , is occupied by a French boy , who is an interesting little aristocrat .

		The study of his character is neither consistent nor profound , but it is effective nevertheless , and it has some originality .

		Democratic ideas are developed in his obstinate little head at last , but his French notions produce some curi - ous situations .

		And the scene in which he demands the hand of a playmate from her father is amusing even if it is false .

		There is a suggestion of Little Lord
Fauntleroy	PERSON	about the book just named , as there is also in '' A
Little House	ORGANIZATION	in Pimlico '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , by Miss
Marguerite Bon	PERSON	vet .

		But in spite of this , the latter is an attractive little story , very daintily written .

		The characters are exaggerated , sentimentalized a little ; the mother and son are almost too good and gentle , and the uncle is much too crotch - etty .

		But there is a certain delicate grace in the man - ner of telling the simple story , which has its charm .

		The leading character of the book is Beckie the maid , who has a good deal of individuality .

		The pictures , by Miss
Helen Maitland Armstrong	PERSON	, are excellent .

		The hero of `` The Wreck of the Circus '' -LRB-
Crowell	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
James Otis	PERSON	, is not a model of goodness , but he is heavily punished for his faults .

		His parents , how - ever , are not punished at all for their inconsiderate cruelty in ordering a healthy boy to stay at home and take care of the baby on the one day when the circus is in possession of the town .

		His revolt is as natural as the terror which assails him when he thinks the baby crushed under the fallen tent .

		The narrative is well bandied , and has a wholesome moral for boys and for the mothers of boys .

		Mrs.
Elizabeth W. Champney	PERSON	has written a delightful little French story in ''
Pierre	PERSON	and his Poodle '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Its heroes are two French poodles , one of whom is an aristocrat and the other the property of a travelling show-wagon .

		But love levels all ranks , and the two join forces and pass through many interest - ing adventures together .

		Incidentally the life of the travelling showman is depicted , with many a French custom , strange to us .

		There is an exciting scene where
Pierre	PERSON	rescues Popotte as they are about to feed her to the serpent , and is himself almost killed in the effort .

		Mrs.
Cbampney	PERSON	has written many children 's stories , but none so good as this .

		She has given individuality and charm to her characters , including her dogs .

		The pictures , by Mr.
F. D. Steele	PERSON	, are as clever as the story .

		`` Derick '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Miss
Barbara Yechton	PERSON	, is a pretty story , rather too pretty .

		It con - 846 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, tains a good deal of superfluous talk about dress , and the city life it describes is not particularly bracing .

		But
Derick	PERSON	's purchase of a silver butter-dish surmounted by a resplendent cow , and his presentation of it to his rich friend , is a clever bit of description .

		It would require a self-sacrificing boy to withstand so alluring a title-page as that of '' The Rover 's Quest '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr.
Hugh St. Leger	PERSON	.

		It is described as '' a story of foam , fire , and fight , '' and the author does his best to live up to this thrilling characteriza - tion .

		A new edition of two of the perennial Hollo books , Rollo at Work '' and '' Hollo at Play '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , is published , after forty years since their first appearance , and they are supplied with a preface in which parents are informed that the books will do good service in `` cultivating the thinking powers , in promoting the progress of children , and in cultivating the amiable and gentle qualities of the heart . ''

		With such advantages it would be a stony-hearted parent who could resist the inclination to put these favorites of his own youth into the hands of his boys and girls .

		A new translation of '' Cuore , '' by
Edmondo de Ami	PERSON	- cis , is published under the title of '' The Heart of a Boy '' -LRB-
Laird & Lee	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The translation is the work of Prof.
G. Mantellini	PERSON	, and is well done in spite of occa - sional roughnesses .

		The book deserves to be as well known in
America	LOCATION	as in
Italy	LOCATION	, for there is nothing special or exceptional in its application .

		It goes to the root of things , touching the fundamental emotions of youth .

		And though it is a quiet story of school-life , it has an absorbing interest , and is in many ways one of the best books that have ever been written for boys .

		Three new volumes in the '' Bound to Win '' series -LRB-
W. L. Allison Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- tell of different kinds of adven - ture .

		In '' Poor but Plucky , '' by
Arthur M. Winfield	PERSON	, the hero finds his enemies in floods and robbers and conspirators .

		But he lives up to the title with remark - able and rather amusing consistency The same author 's '' Schooldays of
Fred Harley	PERSON	'' is occupied with games rather than with books , baseball being especially prom - inent .

		The nature of the adventures and the way they are described are rather different from the fine serenity of de Amicis ' school-life .

		Hunting is the special fea - ture of '' Gun and Sled , '' by Captain
Ralph Bonehill	PERSON	, and it enables him to tell many a hair-raising story of fights with wild-cats and wolves , which even a boy could hardly take very seriously .

		Two stories by ''
Oliver Optic	PERSON	'' are contributed to the holiday pleasures of boys .

		`` At the Front '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the fifth of the land series of '' The Blue and the Gray , '' the battle of Stone River being its cen - tre and climax ''
Pacific Shores	LOCATION	'' is the last volume of the `` All-over - the - World Library '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The voyage includes
Japan	LOCATION	,
Australia	LOCATION	,
New Zealand	LOCATION	, and the
Fiji Islands	LOCATION	, and brings the boy traveller home a `` model hero . ''

		The Rev.
Louis Albert Banks	PERSON	in his `` An Oregon Boyhood '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , tells a story of western pioneering .

		He does it rather heavily , but his book contains much interesting information regarding the life of the adventurous men who first crossed the conti - nent The same publishers reprint in the small books of the '' Hearthstone series '' three good stories for boys , `` The Man who Stole a Meeting -
House	ORGANIZATION	, '' by
J. T. Trowbridge	PERSON	; `` Getting an Indorser , '' by
Oliver Optic	PERSON	; and `` Exiled from Two Lands , '' by
E. T. Tom	PERSON	- linson .

		360 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, A HINT FOR THE HOLIDAYS .

		FOR THE PRESENT HOLIDAY SEASON , Book-lovers have the chance to procure for gift purposes such a literary treasure as was never before seen .

		To Mr.
Charles Dudley Warner	PERSON	, as its editor-in-chief , belongs the palm of victory for this achievement in book production .

		The '' Library of the World 's Best Literature , '' as it has been happily named , might also fitly be termed the world 's crowning effort in the creation of books .

		Either praise or minute description of this magnificent work would seem almost needless to a public that has read its eulogy , since the appearance of the very first volume , in all the chief literary periodicals of the country .

		Just here may be noted briefly the principal features that constitute the Library a work of surpassing excellence for profit and enjoyment : CRITICAL ESSAYS .

		About a thousand graphic essays , by living scholars and writers of eminence , furnish in popular style their critical , interpretative , biographical , and historical comments on the world 's great authors and their principal works , alike of ancient and modern times .

		In every one of these the critic is also a specialist in relation to his subject .

		SELECTED LITERATURE .

		Following the interpretative studies are presented the master productions of the most famous writers of all ages and countries .

		The collection includes Poetry , History , Romance , Oratory , Biography , Science and Philosophy , Theology , Letters , Drama , Wit and Humor , and every other form of literary expression .

		HISTORY OF LITERATURE .

		The Library contains histories of all the world 's literatures , ancient and modern , written in each case by a specialist who is recognized as author - ity on the subject .

		The sacred books of the nations also form special studies .

		SYNOPSIS OF BEST BOOKS .

		Three thousand of the world 's best books are separately analyzed and given in clear synopsis of narrative , plot , and characters .

		Refreshes our past reading and guides to that of the future .

		BIOGRAPHICAL DICTIONARY .

		The most complete and accurate dictionary of the lives of great authors ever made .

		It embraces 12,000 names and gives under each all essential facts and literary successes .

		INDEX .

		The most elaborate and careful ever yet compiled for a work of magnitude .

		It indexes by reference and cross-reference every name , event , book , selection , topic and senti - ment treated of on any page of the Library .

		An immense boon to literary workers .

		Such are the chief features that distinguish the `` Library of the World 's Best Literature . ''

		But they are not all .

		There are others that serve to make it as helpful to the student and scholar as it is bright and entertaining for mere intellectual recreation .

		Not for those of next year or the years to follow , can the LIBRARY be obtained at the excep - tionally low price now made available through the
Harper	PERSON	's
Weekly Club	ORGANIZATION	.

		This was only established as an introductory figure to enable the public to learn the merits and value of the work .

		THE PRICE is TO BE ADVANCED AFTER NEW YEAR 'S DAT .

		None should miss the present opportunity to secure full particulars under the exceptionally advantageous offer made for the month of
December	DATE	to all who become members of the
Harper 's Weekly Club	ORGANIZATION	.

		Two volumes , 8vo ,
$ 7.50	MONEY	.

		CONTENTS : Biography The European Journals , 1826-29 The Labrador Journal , 1833 The
Missouri	LOCATION	Journals ,
1843	DATE	The Episodes .

		In these volumes appears for the first time not only an adequate and correct biography of Audubon , but the full text of his famous '' Journals '' and '' Episodes . ''

		Now we have '' the living man in place of the death-mask '' which has for thirty years passed as a true repre - sentation .

		The entire publication is virtually new .

		The
Missouri Journals	ORGANIZATION	are almost wholly new ; the Labrador and European ones largely so , and the Episodes never before collectively printed in English .

		For the benefit of the scientific readers Dr.
Elliott Coues	PERSON	has supplied abundant zoological notes , but the work is really one which appeals in the widest manner to the general public .

		Among the many illustrations are three fine examples of bird drawings by Audubon never before published , and there are also ten portraits of him .

		There are few subjects the literature of which is more deficient than is the case with house decoration , and the present volume will appeal to all who are confronted by the many problems that arise in the arrangement and decoration of the home .

		The suggestive descriptions are reinforced by a series of photographic illustrations showing what good taste and ingenuity have already devised for various conditions .

		* Mr.
Charles Robinson	PERSON	is a draughtsman who seems to have been born to make drawings of babies and children .

		He illustrated to perfection
Stevenson	PERSON	's book , '' A Child 's Garden of Verses , '' and now the
Scribners	ORGANIZATION	publish a selection from
Eugene Field	ORGANIZATION	's poems , made by
Kenneth Grahame	PERSON	and illustrated by Mr.
Robinson	PERSON	, which is wholly irresistible .

		` Lullaby Land : Songs of Childhood , ' as the book is called , is packed with droll ideas expressed in engaging form .

		Field was at his best in such rhymes .

		Mr.
Grahame	PERSON	's tribute is that of a man peculiarly qualified to speak on the subject , and to him and Mr.
Robinson	PERSON	we owe a debt of gratitude .

		It is a songbook to be put beside the
Stevenson	PERSON	collection and there regarded with affection . ''

		Not many writers live who could have drawn this man so finely and made him so real .

		His character alone gives the book a valid excuse for existence , but the story is so interesting and so artistically written that even the readers of ' A Lady of Quality ' will be held to the end . ''

		In this book Mr.

		LITERARY NOTES 403 LIST OF NEW BOOKS .

		.

		404 THE ACADEMY GAME .

		When subjects of a timely or sensational nature fail him , the resourceful literary editor always has the satisfaction of knowing that he can fall back upon a discussion of some such well-worn subject as the ten greatest poems , or the hundred best books , or the forty living writers most deserving of academic immortality .

		These diversions characterize the '' silly season '' of literary journalism , and always provide both amusement and edification to the philosophical student of critical opinion .

		The last of the subjects above mentioned is the one just now upon the tapis , and the ball of discussion has been set rolling , with a fair amount of impetus , by our English contemporary , `` The Academy , '' in a praiseworthy effort to live up to the obli - gations of its name .

		The thing is done in the old familiar way .

		A list of forty names is printed , and the public is invited to take a hand in the melee , while participation is further stimulated by the per - sonal appeal of the editor to as many well - known writers as he thinks are likely to fall 382 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, victim to his wiles .

		Here is the initial list
John Raskin	PERSON	.

Lewis Carroll	PERSON	. ''

		Furthermore , to give the discussion an air of seriousness , it is proposed to '' crown '' two '' books of signal merit '' chosen from among the publications of each year .

		But this pre - tence of seriousness does not seem to have im - posed upon anyone except Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	, who comments upon the plan with his customary suavity . ''

		The notion of an English academy is too seriously stupid for a farce , and too es - sentially vulgar for a comedy , '' he remarks , and adds : `` It seems to me that the full and proper definition of so preposterous an imper - tinence must be left to others than the bearer of a name selected for the adulation of such an insult . ''

		Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	always gets excited about things that he does n't like , and his sense of humor , elsewhere so richly displayed , deserts him upon such occasions .

		Most of the con - tributors to the `` Academy '' symposium , how - ever , write in a vein of good humor , and their opinions , although couched in sober terms , are mostly suggestive of a suppressed chuckle .

		It is only a game , after all , and the object of games is to provide entertainment for those who participate in them .

		We can not resist the temptation to take a hand ourselves , and trust that our observations , however serious they may seem , will not be taken as expressing the opinion that an English academy , thus created de novo , is either desirable or even possible .

		The list presented is not a bad one , as such lists go , and the names are all of people whose intellectual standing is such as to justify their consideration all , that is , except the Rev.
Aidan Gasquet	PERSON	, of whose achievements we are bound to confess entire ignorance . ''

		Who is the Rev.
Aidan Gasquet	PERSON	? ''

		asks Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	, and we can not refrain from adding his other question : '' Why does the
Duke of Argyll	ORGANIZATION	always figure in this sort of thing ? ''

		It is a little puzzling to find Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	in this galley , and if his name be not promptly withdrawn we shall insist upon making Mr.
Rudyard Kipling	PERSON	a member of the American academy as soon as we get around to the organ - ization of that equally-to-be-desired body .

		A fair exchange is no robbery .

		And it is surely unkind to ask , as one correspondent does , '' If you admit an American -LRB- in the person of Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	-RRB- , why not admit Captain
Mahan	PERSON	, and so exhaust American literature ? ''

		Ex - haust , indeed !

		Such sayings do not further the great cause of international amenity .

		Have we not recently produced a '' Library of the World 's Best Literature '' in which , upon our own showing , there may be found American immortals to the number of several times the beggarly forty of our English contemporary ?

		A few of the comments made upon the '' Academy '' list are too interesting to be missed .

		Sir
Herbert Maxwell	PERSON	writes : `` I have no confidence whatever in Mr.
W. E. Glad	PERSON	- stone 's literary judgment ; he is omnivorous , and writes as enthusiastically about ` The
Chris	PERSON	- tian ' as about ` The Odyssey . '

		Greatly as I admire his faculties in his own sphere , he is no more than a peregrine in literature . ''

		The same writer futher remarks : '' I am sorry that I can - not restrain a shudder at the prospect of Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	having a hand in moulding style . ''

		Perhaps the boldest of the correspondents is the one who carps at the two women on the list ; but his misogyny is counterbalanced by the other writer who sends a list of forty women proposed for a parallel academy of the downtrodden sex .

		Some names included in the '' Academy '' forty are certainly astonishing , when we consider the names that do not appear .

		Here are a score of candidates for the '' forty-first armchair . ''


James Martineau	PERSON	.


Henry Sidgwick	PERSON	.

		Sir
Frederick Pollock	PERSON	.

		Robert Bridges .

		Lord

Augustus Jessopp	PERSON	.

		A list that leaves out the best of these , and yet finds places for Mr.
J. M. Barrie	PERSON	, Mr.
W. S. Gilbert	PERSON	, Mr.
William Archer	PERSON	, and Mr.
W. B. Yeats	PERSON	, is certainly not a list controlled by the sort of critical judgment that commands re - spect .

Nicoll	PERSON	writes as follows : He k ' is undoubtedly the first of living critics , and per - haps the first of all English critics .

		No one in our country has handled books as he has done with a knowledge of the literature of the whole world . ''

		Hardly less glaring is the lack of discernment which sets Sir
G. O. Trevelyan	PERSON	above Mr.
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	, of Professor Ker above Professor
Dowden	PERSON	, or Mr.
Francis Thompson	PERSON	above Mr.
Robert Bridges	PERSON	, or Mr.

		But we are getting serious ourselves , which is not at all what we intended .

		So we forego the temptation to quote from
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	on '' The Literary Influence of Academies , '' ' or even from Mr.

		ENGLISH CORRESPONDENCE .


LONDON	LOCATION	,
Dec. 5 , 1897	DATE	.

		The rush and stress of the publishing season of
1897	DATE	is over , and publishers as well as authors are breathing a space , or speculating as to how the public will receive the many things , good and bad , which have been pre - pared for it .

		Meanwhile , all the work falls on the shoulders of the hard-worked and ill-paid bookseller , who is just now groaning that he ca n't make a '' living wage . ''

		Much has been argued , more written , and more will be written , on this everlasting question the rela - tions of the publisher , bookseller , and author ; but of this , another time .

		Without a doubt , the success of the season has been Lord
Tennyson	PERSON	's '' Life '' of his father .

		On all sides , from high and low , from great and small , the work has been accorded a welcome quite unique in the annals of the past ten years of literature .

		Tbat it would receive a cordial greeting was expected , for the '' Life '' of
Alfred Tennyson	PERSON	suggested much that was interesting ; but what was not anticipated was the unstinted praise it has obtained as a piece of literary biography .

		Apart from the subject matter of the two volumes , it seems that we must accept the '' Life of Tennyson '' as among the few great biographies in our language ; otherwise , the critics must be wrong .

		Of course , that critics should err , can not for a moment be granted ; since the mark of the modern critic is his capacity for anticipating the verdict of posterity .

		Fortunately , however , for this '' Life , '' it has not been appraised by the '' common or garden '' critic ; so that we may take the opinion passed as the outcome of judicious thinking and scholarly ap - preciation .

		At any rate , it has sold remarkably well ; so well , indeed , that the English publisher who said , `` the selling power of a book is in inverse ratio to its intrinsic value , '' must surely now remodel bis law .

		Our English critics have , for some time now , been having a bad time of it .

		It all began with
Marie Corelli	PERSON	, when she stopped sending them her novels for review , and so deprived them of a legitimate source of income .

		In all probability , we shall now hear of another lady novelist emulating
Miss Corelli	LOCATION	in this respect .

		The reviewer of Mrs.
Sarah Grand	PERSON	's `` The Beth Book , '' in the
London	LOCATION	'' Daily Telegraph , '' had occasion , after praising the first part of that good dame 's story , to animadvert on the `` sexuality '' of the second part .

		The animadversion has evidently touched Mrs. Grand , for she writes the following letter to the '' Telegraph . ''

		I give it in extenso , as illustrating how to write `` in the grand manner . ''

		The lady writes from the Pyrenees . ''

		SIR .

		My distance from home makes the receipt of papers a somewhat fitful event , and this must be my excuse for the delay in answering your delicate apostrophe to me .

		That you should insult
Scott	PERSON	and
Thackeray	PERSON	and
Dickens	PERSON	with your approval p-tins me but little , since they will never hear of it ; that you are so much cleverer than I am I must modestly accept your word for ; that you strain yourself to be facetious and but prove yourself a dnnce , I must attribute to your acad - emic degree , and a course of the blighting wit of the common - room ; that yon should attack me with base misrepresentation , I set down to some rag of chivalry that still clings to you ; that you are of ancient lineage I am willing to admit , since your putting into my mouth words and sentiments which are not mine shows you infected with the blood of Ananias ; that you should take yourself as a serious judge of art is a crime for which it is painful to think you must one day settle between yon and your God ; but that you should write yourself down an admirer of mine is the ugliest blow that my art has dealt me , and I take this opportunity to publicly apologise for it .

		Believe me , yours in sorrow for your insincerity , SARAH GRAND . ''

		All this does not mean that the lady is angry ; quite the contrary .

		She is just her sweetly angelical self , even as one of her heavenly twins would be .

		Let the '' Academy '' note , and fail not to give its 100 reward to the fortunate and discriminating judge who shall choose Mrs.
Sarah Grand	PERSON	as one whom a possible '' Academy '' would delight to honor .

		Well may ' Punch '' make her say , '' I have written the beth book in the world ; I know no better . ''

		Our new great '' literary weekly '' is progressing apace .

		From all that one hears , and by all that one may judge , '' Literature '' is likely to become an im - portant influence in the development of those conditions which make literature possible .

		Its reviews and articles are distinguished by original thought and scholarly treatment .

		We are hoping , sincerely , that it may never descend to academic '' dryasdustery , '' and that it will give us just a little more for our money .

		With the new year , the
Kelmscott Press	ORGANIZATION	will cease 384 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, to exist .

		Its last publication is to be a '' Note , '' by the late Mr.
William Morris	PERSON	, on his aims in starting the Press .

		The type is to remain in the hands of the trus - tees '' for future use , '' but the '' special ornament will be discontinued , and the wood-blocks deposited in the British Museum . ''

		This is as it should be .

		However excellently well intentioned the trustees and their help - ers may have been , it must , long ago , have been made evident to them that the Press without Mr.
Morris	PERSON	was , after all , not the same thing as the Press with Mr.
Morris	PERSON	.

		Some day , this will be better appreciated , when we find collectors confining their purchases to those books only which had the benefit of the supervision and orna - mentation of the printer himself .

		Much is in the air as to future publications .

		LIFE AND LETTERS OF MRS. STOWE .

		* Mrs. Fields 's succinct Life of Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	contains so much that came originally from the lips or the pen of the heroine herself that it may not unfairly be termed an autobiography .

		The narrative of her early life is given mainly as she gave it to her son and biographer , the Rev.
C. E. Stowe	PERSON	; while her full and very frank letters to her friends supply the ground - work and substance of the rest of the story .

		Mrs. Fields 's task has thus been mainly edi - torial .

		Her book is essentially and professedly a compilation of biographical material , rather than a biography proper ; but it is a compact and workmanlike production , full of pith and guiltless of padding ; and these are no small merits in a day when the mistaken liberality of most biographers insists upon giving us two fat volumes when one lean one would have sufficed .

		It is in the letters that the interest of Mrs. Fields 's book chiefly lies , and it is to them that we shall confine our quotations .

		The later ones indicate clearly how genuine and deep-seated was Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	's devotion to the great cause with which her name is inseparably connected .

		The embers of the old wrath against the oppres - sor smouldered to the last .

		In a letter from
Boston	LOCATION	in
1882	DATE	to her married daughter the flame leaps up again . ''

		... It -LSB- the Diary of
John Quincy Adams	PERSON	-RSB- is a history of our own country through all the period of slavery usurpation that led to the war .

		The industry of the man in writing is wonderful .

		Every day 's doings in the
House	ORGANIZATION	are faithfully daguerreotyped , all the mean tricks , contrivances of the slave-power , and the pusillanimity of the
Northern	ORGANIZATION	members from day to day recorded .


Calhoun	PERSON	was then
Secretary of State	ORGANIZATION	.

		Under bis connivance even the
United States	LOCATION	census was falsified , to prove that freedom was bad for negroes .

		Records of deaf , dumb , and blind , and insane colored people , were distributed in the
Northern States	LOCATION	, and in places where
John Quincy Adams	PERSON	had means of proving there were no negroes .

		When he found that these fal - sified figures had been used with the English ambassador as reasons for admitting
Texas	LOCATION	as a slave State , the old man called on
Calboun	ORGANIZATION	, and showed him the indus - triously collected proofs of the falsity of this census .

		He says : ` He writhed like a trodden rattlesnake , but said the census was full of mistakes ; but one part bal - anced another it was not worth while to correct them . '

		His whole life was an incessant warfare with the rapidly advancing spirit of slavery , that was coiling like a ser - pent around everything .

		THE DIAL 385 old man .

		He died without even seeing the dawn of liberty which God has brought ; but oh !

		I am sure he sees it from above .

		He died in the Capitol , in the midst of his labors , and the last words he said were , < This is the last of earth ; I am content . '

		And now , I trust , he is with God ... All , all are gone .

		All that raged ; all that threatened ; all the cowards that yielded ; truckled , sold their country for a mess of pottage ; all the men that stood and bore infamy and scorn for the truth ; all are silent in dust ; the fight is over , but eter - nity will never efface from their souls whether they did well or ill whether they , fought bravely or failed like cowards .

		In a sense , our lives are irreparable .

		If we shrink , if we fail , if we choose the fleeting instead of the eternal , God may forgive us ; but there must be an eternal regret !

		This man lived for humanity when hardest bestead ; for truth when truth was unpopular ; for Christ when Christ stood chained and scourged in the person of the slave . ''

		A letter to Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	in
1876	DATE	gives us an inkling of Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	's later views on spiritual - ism a subject upon which , as her closer friends knew , she had at one time bestowed much thought . ''

		... I remember a remark you once made on spiritualism .

		I can not recall the words , but you spoke of it as modifying the sharp angles of Calvinistic belief , as a fog does those of a landscape .

		I would like to talk with you some time on spiritualism , and show you a col - lection of very curious facts that I have acquired through mediums not professional .

		I have long since come to the conclusion that the marvels of spiritualism are natural , and not supernatural , phenomena , an uncommon work - ing of natural laws .

		I believe that the door between those in the body and those out has never in any age been entirely closed , and that occasional perceptions within the veil are a part of the course of nature , and therefore not miraculous . ''

		A letter to Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	of earlier date than the foregoing one refers interestingly to ``
Elsie Venner	PERSON	, '' which was then running its course in the ''
Atlantic	LOCATION	. '' ''

		... I know not what others may think of it , since I have seen nobody since my return ; but to me it is of deeper and broader interest than anything you have done yet , and I feel an intense curiosity concerning that underworld of thought from which like bubbles your incidents and remarks often seem to burst up .

		The foundations of moral responsibility , the interlacing laws of nature and spirit , and their relation to us here and here - after , are topics which I ponder more and more , and on which only one medically educated can write well '' A letter of Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	's to
George Eliot	PERSON	, in which she seems to have expressed some mis - givings as to the reception of '' Oldtown Folks '' in
England	LOCATION	, elicited the following reply : '' I have good hopes that your fears are groundless as to the obstacles your new book may find here from its thorough American character .

		Most readers who are likely to be really influenced by writing above the com - mon order will find that special aspect an added reason for interest and study ; and I dare say you have long seen , as I am beginning to see with new clearness , that if a book which has any sort of exquisiteness happens also to be a popular , widely circulated book , the power over the social mind for any good is , after all , due to its reception by a few appreciative natures , and is the slow result of radiation from that narrow circle .

		I mean that you can affect a few souls , and that each of these in turn may affect a few more , but that no exquisite book tells properly and directly on a multitude , however largely it may be spread by type and paper .

		Witness the things the multitude will say about it , if one is so unhappy as to be obliged to hear their sayings .

		I do not write this cyn - ically , but in pure sadness and pity .

		Both travelling abroad and staying at home among our English sights and sports , one must continually feel how slowly the centuries work toward the moral good of man , and that thought lies very close to what you say concerning my religious point of view .

		I believe that religion , too , has to be modified according to the dominant phases ; that a religion more perfect than any yet prevalent must express less care of personal consolation , and the more deeply awing sense of responsibility to man springing from sympathy with that which of all things is most cer - tainly known to us , the difficulty of the human lot . ''

		An amusing note to
George Eliot	PERSON	from Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	, in
1872	DATE	, contains a veiled personal allu - sion that may set the reader a-guessing . ''

		... Yesterday we were both out of our senses with mingled pity and indignation at that dreadful stick of a Casaubon , and think of poor
Dorothea	PERSON	dashing like a warm , sunny wave against so cold and repulsive a rock !

		He is a little too dreadful for anything ; there does not seem to be a drop of warm blood in him , and so , as it is his misfortune and not his fault to be cold-blooded , one must not get angry with him .

		It is the scene in the garden , after the interview with the doctor , that rests on our mind at this present .

		There was such a man as he over in
Boston	LOCATION	, high in literary circles , but I fancy his wife was n't like
Dorothea	PERSON	, and a vastly proper time they had of it , treating each other with mutual rever - ence , like two Chinese mandarins . ''


James Russell Lowell	PERSON	's ardent admiration of Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	's work is eloquently expressed in a letter to her in regard to '' The Minister 's Woo - ing '' : '' ... Let your moral take care of itself , and remem - ber that an author 's writing-desk is something infinitely higher than a pulpit .

		What I call care of itself ' is shown in that noble passage in the
February	DATE	number about the ladder up to heaven .

		That is grand preach - ing and in the right way .

		I am sure that ' The Minister 's Wooing ' is going to be the best of your products hith - erto , and I am sure of it because you show so thorough a mastery of your material , so true a perception of re - alities , without which the ideality is impossible ... Woman charms a higher faculty in us than reason , God be praised , and nothing has delighted me more in your new story than the happy instinct with which you develop this incapacity of the lover 's logic in your female char - acters .

		Go on just as you have begun , and make it ap - pear in as many ways as you like that , whatever creed may be true , it is not true , and never will be , that man can be saved by machinery .

		I can speak with some chance of being right , for I confess a deep sympathy with many parts of Calvanistic theology , and , ... for one thing believe in hell with all my might , and in the goodness of God for all that ... 1 have not said any - thing .

		What could I say ?

		One might as well advise 386 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, a mother about the child she still bears under her heart , and say , Give it these and those qualities , as an author about a work yet in her brain .

		Only this I will say , that I am honestly delighted with ' The Minister 's Woo - ing ' ; that reading it has been one of my few editorial pleasures ; that no one appreciates your genius more highly than I , or hopes more fervently that you will let yourself go without regard to this , that , or t ` other .

		Do n't read any criticisms on your story ; believe that you know better than any of us , and be sure that every - body likes it .

		That I know .

		There is not , and never was , anybody so competent to write a true
New England	LOCATION	poem as yourself , and have no doubt that you are doing it .

		The native sod sends up the best inspiration to the brain , and you are as sure of immortality as we all are of dying , if you only go on with entire faith in your - self . ''

		Mrs. Fields 's little book is brimful of good reading , and we earnestly recommend it to the younger generation especially , to whom the au - thor of `` Uncle Tom 's Cabin '' is already an his - toric figure and fading into the shadow-land of the nation 's storied past .

		It contains the essence of a life - story that every American should be familiar with ; for the name of
Harriet Beecher Stowe	PERSON	is writ large and bright on that page of our history of which we as a nation have the clearest reason to be proud .

		In our gratitude to the statesmen and soldiers of that great day let us not forget the part this fragile New En - gland woman bore in erasing from our national scutcheon its chief blot .

		Of all the moral forces that made for the right when the issue of slav - ery or no slavery was still a living one , there was certainly none more potent than her great book great in that it so marvellously wrung the heart and stung the conscience of a genera - tion grown apathetic in the sight of wrong , and because it carried with it from our shores a tidal wave of human feeling and loving-kindness , of sympathy with the oppressed and wrath against the oppressor , that rolled around the world .

		Har - riet
Beecher Stowe	PERSON	was indubitably of the stuff of which the world 's moral heroes are made .

		She loved the truth for its own sake , and clung to it the more when she found it unpopular ; she pro- claimed it to all the world from the house - tops , at a time when even to whisper it in secret places meant obloquy .

		It is related that when Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	first called upon President Lincoln , in
1862	DATE	, he seized her hand , saying , '' Is this the little woman who made this great war ? ''

		That was , of course , a kindly and half - playful exag - geration of the truth .

		Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	did not make the war ; the social wrong it righted and the constitutional question it settled made it , and it must have come in the fulness of time had her book never been written .

		But that it came the sooner , and was the more welcome to those who waged it for humanity 's sake , because of that book , there is no doubt .

		Through its winged words and moving pictures it keyed men 's minds up to the heroic pitch and steeled the long-faltering heart of the North for the irrepressible conflict .

		As long as the history of our country continues to be read , the name of the author of `` Uncle Tom 's Cabin '' will re - main one that all high spirits delight to honor .

		Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	's life was not lacking in the elements of storm and stress , and at one period of it she had more than a passing acquaintance with something very like poverty .

		But the end was tranquil a serene and slowly waning eventide of rest , after the toil and bustle of the day .

		Her pen , once so restlessly busy , was laid aside latterly , save for a brief , exceptional note to her closer friends .

		These missives are often tinged with a pathetic consciousness of failing powers and fading interests .

		Toward the end she wrote to Mrs.
Howard	PERSON	: '' ... My mind wanders like a running brook , and I do not think of my friends as I used to , unless they recall themselves to me by some kind action .

		... I think I am in something of the condition of the silk - worm who has spun out all his silk , and can spin no more , unless he has some fresh mulberry leaves .

		When I reach ' the golden shores ' where grow the trees of life , there I may be able to renew the happy friendships with those who have gone before and may come after me to that happy land ... My sun has set .

		The time of work for me is over .

		I have written all my words and thought all my thoughts , and now I rest me in the flickering light of the dying embers , in a rest so profound that the voice of an old friend arouses me but momen - tarily , and I drop back again into repose . ''

		Mrs. Fields has not thought fit to weave into the narrative much in the way of historical fact or comment , or of literary exposition and ap - preciation .

		She has given us a delightful and inspiring book , rich in biographical essentials , and it is likely to hold its place as the standard '' Life '' of Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	, until the time comes when a really critical and definitive one can be written .


E. G. J.	PERSON	EX-PRESIDENT 'S VIEWS or HIS COUNTRY .

		* It is interesting to learn what it is that an ex-president of the
United States	LOCATION	regards as '' This Country of Ours . ''

		An inspection of Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	's volume bearing that title shows that he considers it to be substantially the Executive branch of the
Federal Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		He devotes 16 pages to the Constitution , 51 * THIS COUNTRY OF OCRS .

		By
Benjamin Harrison	PERSON	.

		Ex - President of the
United States	LOCATION	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Charles Scrib	PERSON	- ner 's Sons .

		1897 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 387 pages to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, 232 pages to the Executive , 31 pages to the Judiciary , and no pages to state or municipal institutions .

		Of course this is hardly a balanced scheme , or one that gives an adequate view of the polit - ical life of the Republic .


Congress	ORGANIZATION	and the courts play a larger part in the national drama than would appear from Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	's sketch .

		Under our dual system of government , no ac - count is complete which omits the States .

		With the present tendencies of social development , any treatment is defective which omits muni - cipal structure and problems .

		So '' This Coun - try of Ours '' turns out to be a fragment .

		Perhaps an instructive collaboration would combine Ex-President
Harrison	PERSON	,
Speaker Reed	ORGANIZATION	,
Justice Field	ORGANIZATION	, Ex-Governor
Grover Cleveland	PERSON	, and Ex-Mayor
Seth Low	PERSON	.

		Each of these could speak from wide knowledge , large views of things , unquestioned patriotism , and profound public confidence .

		A book which they would make would be a most unique and valuable contribution to political science .

		But if Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	's little book is a frag - ment , nevertheless it is an interesting one .

		Besides being clear and accurate in its presen - tation of facts , it is interspersed with striking comments on the actual workings of govern - ment comments especially worthy of atten - tion as coming from one who knows , and whose judgment is so sane as is that of Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	.

		A few of these comments may as well be quoted bodily . ''

		The close of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and the beginning of the President 's term should be changed to
May 4	DATE	.

		This would make the ' short session ' available for something besides the appropriation bills , would diminish the chances of a Vice - Presidential succession , and save many useful lives for I do not doubt that the exposure and suffering endured by the parading organizations and by the spectators in
1881	DATE	,
1889	DATE	, and
1893	DATE	, carried many people to premature graves '' -LRB- page 94 -RRB- .

		This suggestion has been frequently made .

		It would seem eminently sensible and unobjec - tionable .

		SenatoB
Mason of Illinois	ORGANIZATION	is inter - ested in the reform of
Senate	ORGANIZATION	procedure .

		Will he undertake this reform also ?

		The Ex-President 's comments on the ap - pointing power are worthy of note . ''

		There can be no doubt that the participation of the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	in the matter of appointments is larger than the Constitution contemplates .

		But as the President can , in the nature of things , know but little about the appli - cants for local offices , and must depend upon someone better informed than he to give him the necessary in - formation , it is quite natural that he should give weight to the advice of the Senator or Representative .

		It ought , however , to be admitted that as the responsibility rests upon the President he must be satisfied of the fitness of the appointment .

		That being satisfactorily established , the public interests are saved , for the choice between fit men is not very important .

		If there is any objection to the appointment , growing out of the char - acter or habits of the applicant , it is pretty sure to be brought out ; and on the whole , considering the number of appointments the President is required to make with - out any personal knowledge of the appointees , the public service is well and honestly conducted . ''

		The
Civil Service	ORGANIZATION	Law has removed a large number of minor offices in the departments at
Washington	LOCATION	, and in the postal and other services , from the scramble of politics , and has given the President , the Cabinet officers , and the Members of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	great relief ; but it still remains true that in the power of appointment to office the President finds the most exacting , unrelenting , and distracting of his duties .

		In the nature of things he begins to make enemies from the start , and has no way of escape it is fate ; and to a sensitive man involves much distress of mind .

		His only support is in the good opinion of those who chiefly care that the public busi - ness shall be well done , and are not disturbed by the consideration whether this man or that man is doing it ; but he hears very little directly from this class .

		No President can conduct a successful administration with - out the support of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and this matter of appoint - ments , do what he will , often weakens that support .

		It is for him always a sort of compromise between his ideal and the best attainable thing '' -LRB- pp. 109 sqq .

		~ -RRB- .

		It is clear that the independence of depart - ments , which was the dream of the framers , does not exist while the appointing power is in practice joint and not exclusive .

		There have been times when the President has been able to use his appointments as a strong lever for good legislation , as was the case in the extra session of
1893	DATE	.

		Indeed , the prevailing ten - dency on the part of the people to trust the President more than the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, seems per - haps a sufficient reason for the fact that there is any substantial opposition to civil service reform .

		Many who have no liking for the spoils system are yet reluctant to deprive the President of an important means of control .

		On page 32 , Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	calls attention to another defect in the
Federal Constitution	ORGANIZATION	, whereby the President is unable to veto items in an appropriation bill .

		Should such power be given , as has been done in several States , legislative log-rolling would at onee disappear .

		It is not to be expected that a reform like this could be carried easily .

		It is the converse of the President 's means of controlling
Congress	ORGANIZATION	- men by means of the appointing power , and
Congress	ORGANIZATION	would not readily abandon it .

		But the Constitution ought to be amended in this sense .

		A very suggestive remark is made on page 226 .

		Our means of national defense have been discussed .

		Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	then adds : '' All these preparations and conditions will promote 388 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, arbitration , and , better still , the direct adjustment of international differences .

		What is won in a lawsuit is neither given with grace nor accepted with gratitude .

		A voluntary surrender of the brutal privilege of killing pregnant and nursing seals for their skins would be a better evidence of good-will than the most touching banquet utterances . ''

		The remark is commended to
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	's book does not rank with that of Mr.
James Bryce	PERSON	it is much simpler in scope .

		But it is a useful discussion , in a brief way , of matters which are worth discussing in many ways and from many points of view .

		* In Professor
Max Miiller	PERSON	's '' Contributions to the Science of Mythology '' -LRB- reviewed in THE DIAL for
June 1 , 1897	DATE	-RRB- , the great Ox - ford scholar made defense of the
Etymologi	PERSON	- cal school of study , and battled against the Ethnopsychical or Anthropological school .

		While keeping his temper fairly well , the old man eloquent was polemic in attitude and made many thrusts at his enemies .

		His book has drawn out a reply in the volume before us '' Modern Mythology , '' by Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	himself says of his book that it is `` wandering and desultory , '' for Mr.
Max Miiller	PERSON	's '' attack is of a skirmishing character .

		Through more than eight hundred pages the learned author keeps up an irregular fire at the ideas and methods of the Anthropological school of mythologists .

		The reply must follow the lines of attack . ''

		The attitude of the An - thropological school is well known .

		It studies the mythologies of modern peoples , either lower races or the peasantry in higher peoples , in order to understand by comparison the myth - ology of ancient nations .

		In a sense , we find mythology in the making , among savages , bar - barians , and peasants .

		Customs and survivals may cast much light upon the past .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	brings forth a good deal of argument in favor of the material , methods , and conclusions of the Anthropological school .

		It is incoherent to a degree , because the book is a `` reply . ''

		The plan pursued is to select those passages of his opponent wherein direct assault is made , to present them , and then to answer them .

		Thus , in the Introduction , he says : `` In agreement with Curtiusand many other scholars , we very sincerely doubt almost all etymologies of old proper names , even in Greek or Sanskrit .

		We find among philologists , as a rule , the widest discrepancies of interpretation .

		Moreover , every name must mean something .

		Now , whatever the meaning of a name -LRB- sup - posing it to be really ascertained -RRB- , very little ingenuity is needed to make it indicate one or other aspect of Dawn or
Night	TIME	, of Lightning or Storm , just as the philologist pleases .

		Then he explains the divine or heroic being denoted by the name as Dawn or Storm , or Fire or Night , or Twilight or Wind in accordance with his private taste , easily accommodating the facts of the myth , whatever they may be , to his favorite solution .

		We rebel against this kind of logic , and per - sist in studying the myth in itself and in comparison with analogous myths in every accessible language . ''

		The topics of our author 's chapters are nat - urally diverse .

		`` Recent Mythology , '' `` The Story of Daphne , '' '' The Question of Allies , '' `` Mannhardt , '' `` Philology and Demeter
Erin	PERSON	- nys , '' '' Totemism , '' '' The Validity of Anthro - pological Evidence , '' `` The Philological Method in Anthropology , '' '' Criticism of Fetichism , '' '' The Eiddle Theory , '' `` Artemis , '' these are all directed to meet Professor
Miiller	PERSON	's criti - cisms and arguments .

		They take up , and in most cases satisfactorily deal with , the objec - tions .

		Two other chapters '' The Fire Walk '' and `` Origin of Death '' are apparently in - serted as illustrations of the Anthropological method .

		Both have appeared , at least in part , as essays in reviews . ''

		The Fire Walk '' pre - sents some particularly interesting material , though the treatment leads to no definite or clear result .

		The fire rite of the Hirpi on
Mount Soracte	LOCATION	is described .

		Striking parallels to it are found in
Fiji	LOCATION	,
Malabar	ORGANIZATION	,
New Zealand	LOCATION	,
Bulgaria	LOCATION	,
Trinidad	LOCATION	, and in
India	LOCATION	.

		These also are described with some detail .

		In all these cases , human beings deliberately walk through fire , unharmed , usually with the purpose of se - curing some desired result .

		Curiously , Mr.

		THE DIAL 389 THE PRE-SHAKESPEARIAN DRAMA .

		* Perhaps the most important literary monu - ments of mediaeval
England	LOCATION	, outside of Chau - cer , are the ballads and the religious and moral plays .

		Professor
Gummere	PERSON	's admirable vol - ume of '' Old English Ballads , '' in the ``
Athen	LOCATION	- aeum Press Series , '' is by far the best handbook for the study of the ballads ; though one might wish that the Appendices had been made into an Introduction and the present learned Intro - duction into an Appendix .

		The existing manual for the study of the English religious drama , Professor
Pollard	PERSON	's '' English Miracle Plays , '' was not a satisfactory book when it first ap - peared , in spite of its valuable prefatory essay ; while the work of a number of investigators during the past seven years , and especially the publication of Band I. of
Creizenach	ORGANIZATION	's `` Ges - chichte des Neueren Dramas '' -LRB-
Halle	LOCATION	, 1893 -RRB- , have made a more adequate survey of the older English drama a necessity .

		The '' Specimens of the Pre-Shaksperean Drama , '' edited by Professor
John M. Manly	PERSON	, of
Brown University	ORGANIZATION	, Volumes I. and II .

		of which have just appeared in the '' Athenaum Press Series , '' will therefore have no rival as a guide to the study of the early English drama .

		The general Introduction and the Notes and Glossary are reserved for Volume III. ; but no one can note the wise system that has governed the selection of the texts in the present volumes , and read Professor Manly 's careful Preface , without feeling convinced that the work is to be a most scholarly and an adequate presentation and interpretation of the beginnings of the En - glish drama .

		390 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, Sealed '' in the prologue which introduces the story .

		The advice is accepted , and the heroine proceeds to tell her story , all in the first person , and a story of strange and absorbing interest it turns out to be one of the best , in fact , that Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	has ever given us .

		Viewed in the retrospect of twenty years , the story of the heroine 's life or rather of the few weeks of happiness that seem to her the whole of her life loses something of its tragic aspect in the soft embrace of a memory that has kept the tenderness rather than the pity of it all .

		For she tells us , speaking in the year
1780	DATE	, how twenty years before she had been wooed and won by a youth who was all gentleness and devotion , and how the cup of happiness was snatched from her on the wedding morn .

		For the youth was no other than the Prince of
Wales	LOCATION	-LRB- albeit his rank had remained unknown to her -RRB- , and the death of his grandfather called him to a throne that he would gladly have renounced for her sake , had it been possible .

		To accept this story at all , we must , of course , accept all the necessary attendant improba - bilities .

		That the lover should have concealed his rank from his sweetheart when it was known to all the world about her , and that
George III	PERSON	.

		was ever such a youth as is here depicted , are things that strain the credulity , and will doubtless make earnest realists sniff with indignation .

		But the true lover of romance cares little for such considerations , and will be satisfied to find the story sweet in sentiment and skilfully contrived to sustain his interest .

		And then there undoubtedly is a certain amount of realism of the best sort in the book -LRB- for Sir
Walter	PERSON	knows his eighteenth century
England	LOCATION	as few others know it -RRB- , and there is much verisimiltude in the details of the narrative , however improbable be the central situation .

		Mr.
Blackmore	PERSON	's new novel is described as '' a romance of Surrey , '' but a just sense of proportion would have made the description run < 4 a romance of
Surrey	LOCATION	and
Daghestan	LOCATION	. ''

		For the author has introduced into the peaceful vales of the English county an exiled Caucasian chieftain and his train -LRB- including one fair daughter -RRB- , and about half the book is an account of the intrigues and blood-feuds of these wild tribesmen of the
Caucasus	LOCATION	, whether carried on in
England	LOCATION	or in their native mountains .

		We do not think that Mr.
Blackmore	PERSON	has been well - advised in his choice of so fantastic a motive for his story , and have no idea that he really knows anything about
Daghestan	LOCATION	and its inhabitants .

		Neither the old chieftain nor his daughter is pre - sented with anything like convincing art , and the honest English squire who falls in love with
Dariel	PERSON	seems much out of place in that galley .

		In the delineation of his English figures , of course , and in his descriptions of English country life , Mr.
Black	PERSON	- more is here , as always , unsurpassable for shrewd - ness and accuracy of observation , while it need hardly be added that his style has a '' body '' which is grateful to the educated literary palate , for it is both rich and distinctive .

		The peculiar vain of fantastic romance based upon scientific conceptions , which has been cultiva - ted of late so successfully by Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	, reaches what is perhaps a climax of daring in his story of '' The Invisible Man . ''

		The idea of the story is by no means new , but the treatment is dis - tinctly novel , for Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's hero is no magician with the gift of fernseed , but a practical student of physics and physiology , who has hit upon a course of treatment whereby the refractive index of the human tissues may be equalized with that of the atmosphere , thus making the body invisible , just as certain jelly-fishes are practically invisible in the medium which they inhabit .

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	has not hesitated to think out his problem , and to face squarely all the minor details incident to this fan - tastic conception , which makes his treatment totally different from the hazy method of his predecessors who have attempted the same subject .

		For example , his invisible man must eat , and the food remains grotesquely visible until it is assimilated , thus neces - sitating his retirement from the neighborhood of men for some hours after a meal .

		Again , his blood , although invisible when in vital circulation , turns red when it is spilt and allowed to coagulate , as his entire body becomes visible at the end after he has been hunted down and killed .

		For the hero of this story is a monster as devoid of moral sentiment as the one created by
Frankenstein	LOCATION	, and he robs and slays without compunction until his career is rudely brought to an end .

		The whole thing is ex - tremely well managed , and all the probability possible is given to a situation which is inherently impossible .

		Mr.
A. E. W. Mason	PERSON	, having recently made a rather unsuccessful venture in the fiction of modern English society , in ''
Lawrence Clavering	PERSON	'' returns to the historical romance of his first love .

		The element of historical fact is somewhat slighter in this book than in most of its class , but we have sketches , such as they are , of such men as the Old Pretender ,
Bolingbroke	LOCATION	, and
Lord Derwentwater	PERSON	, for the story is of the year
1715	DATE	, that witnessed the Stuart rising in
England	LOCATION	and the death of the
Great Monarch	ORGANIZATION	in
France	LOCATION	.

		When , however , the author reaches the one historical occurrence that belongs to the immediate scheme of his narrative , the battle of
Preston	LOCATION	, he balks at the description , and leaves his readers to furbish it up for themselves .

		His story has a most adorable heroine , but a hero who takes so morbid and unnatural a view of his own conduct that he belongs rather to the introspective modern age than to the stirring period of Jacobite plot and intrigue in which he is set .

		Indeed , the '' sin '' for which he suffers such remorse and makes so great a sacrifice exists so wholly in his own imagination that the reader is a good deal puzzled to understand what all the fuss is about , and the bewilderment remains to the end of the novel .

		The by-ways of history afford so many oppor - tunities for the practitioner of historical romance that we are surprised to find so much attention con -
1897	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 391 centrated upon a few favorite themes .

		Mr.
Bloun	PERSON	- delle -
Burton	PERSON	, at least , in his new novel , '' The Clash of Arms , '' has got so far away from the beaten track as to write of the early campaigns of
Marl	ORGANIZATION	- borough and Turenne and of the French conquest of
Lorraine	LOCATION	.

		The romance is one of sustained and singular interest , ingeniously planned , and well - proportioned in all its parts .

		It is one of the best books of its sort that we have read of recent years , and should do much to help its writer to the kind of popularity enjoyed by Mr.
Stanley Weyman	PERSON	and Dr.
Conan Doyle	PERSON	.

		There is something suggestive of good cabinet workmanship in the novels of Mr.
Henry Seton Merriman	PERSON	.

		The nice adjustment of their parts , and the general polish of the works as wholes , are praise - worthy qualities , and go far to atone for the lack of anything like deep feeling or the vital delineation of character .

		These novels have , moreover , as a basis some carefully studied phase of recent history or social development that contributes considerably to their interest .

		`` In Kedar 's Tents , '' for example , has for its main theme the first Carlist rebellion in
Spain	LOCATION	, and incidentally , and by way of prologue , the Chartist agitation in
England	LOCATION	.

		It is a story that holds the attention , and is worked out to a satisfac - tory conclusion , although the exigencies of a pre - liminary serial publication forced a certain jerkiness into its development .

		Some time ago we reviewed a story of an imagin - ary fourth French empire , by a writer who evidently supposed that
France	LOCATION	had already lived through three actual empires .

		A variation upon this theme is now provided by Mr.
Charles Benham	PERSON	's bulky and prolix romance entitled `` The
Fourth Napo	ORGANIZATION	- leon . ''

		We approached this book with pleasurable anticipations .

		It seemed attractive in appearance and theme , besides being of soul-satisfying length .

		But it turned out a very dull story after all , writ - ten in execrable English and with hardly a trace of the verisimilitude that must be the first and the last thing demanded of any such prospective exercise of the historical imagination .

		Besides , we have a right to expect a '' fourth Napoleon '' to accomplish stirring things and be a good deal of a hero in a cheap melodramatic way , instead of being the unspeakable cad and incredibly abject coward here presented to us .

		One might imagine a really thrilling story of the coup d'etat of some imperialist pretender , and of a war for the restoration of the lost French provinces , but Mr.
Benham	PERSON	's story is incapable of producing a thrill , and meanders from episode to episode without display of dramatic en - ergy or grasp of any of the brilliant possibilities in - volved in such a plot as he has framed . ''

		By Right of Sword '' is just a story .

		It has no psychology , no pretence of delineative art , no waste of rhetoric upon descriptive setting , no subtlety of repartee , and hardly a tincture of historical basis .

		It is a story about Nihilist intrigue , but beyond the fact that it includes the assassination of a chief of police and an attempt upon the life of the Tsar , there is nothing in it that ever happened or would be likely to happen to anybody .

		It is , moreover , a piece of sensational melodrama , with the crudest of coloring , and founded upon an impersonation so utterly impossible that such stories as '' The Pris - oner of Zenda '' become absolutely convincing in the comparison .

		It is just a story , designed to en - tertain and not to instruct , and it accomplishes its purpose with more than reasonable completeness .

		`` Queen of the Jesters '' is the title given by Mr.
Max Pernberton	PERSON	to a collection of eight imaginary episodes in the career of one
Mademoiselle de Mon	ORGANIZATION	- tesson , described as '' a famous figure in the
Paris	LOCATION	of Louis XV . ''

		She was , we are told , a beautiful and accomplished woman who '' established herself in an old house in
Hue St. Paul	ORGANIZATION	, and there , sur - rounded by a little band of wits , scientists , and ad - venturers , she made it her ambition to become acquainted with the dens of the city .

		To which end she practised a generous charity , and rescued more than one notorious rogue from the gibbet . ''

		Mr.
Pemberton	PERSON	's stories introduce to our acquaintance a number of most engaging scoundrels , but they take us so very far into the region of the extrava - gant that they lose almost all semblance of contact with actual life , and prove but mildly exciting after all .

		Ingenuity is the most striking characteristic of Mr.
Grant Allen	PERSON	's `` An African Millionaire , '' which might almost be described as an inverted series of
Sherlock Holmes	PERSON	stories .

		In other words , the in - genuity in this case is that displayed by a scamp who devises various ways of swindling a wealthy English speculator , instead of being the detective ingenuity displayed by the professional tracker of criminals .

		In consequence , the several episodes of this narration , although distinct stories , derive a certain unity from the rascal who figures in every one of them , just as the
Sherlock Holmes	PERSON	episodes derived their unity from their detective hero .

		The Colonel Clay of this sheaf of stories is certainly a most attractive swindler , although it taxes the imag - ination to accept the various disguises in which he operates , and although the probabilities are severely strained in more ways than one .

		What we should like to read now would be a story in which Colonel Clay should be pitted against
Sherlock Holmes	PERSON	in a desperate struggle of wits , and we confess that we do not know which of the two would come out ahead , which is perhaps the best tribute we can pay to the entertaining qualities of Mr.
Allen	PERSON	's book .

MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		A selection of `` Poems by
William Wordsworth	PERSON	, '' edited by Professor
Edward Dowden	PERSON	, is one of the latest issues of the '' Athenaeum Press '' series , published by
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volume is a substantial one , containing one hundred pages of introduction , three hundred and fifty of text , and over one hundred and fifty of notes .

		The text used is that of Mr.
Thomas Hutchinson	PERSON	, '' the most learned and accurate of Words - worth scholars . ''

		392 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, HOLIDAY PUBLICATIONS .

		n. From the novelty of its subject and its genuine importance to the experience of the race , '' A His - tory of Dancing '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , is the most notable of our Holiday books ; as , from its mechanical form and the variety and beauty of its illustrations , it is the most sumptuous .

		The text is translated from the French of
Gaston Vuillier	PERSON	, and covers the subject from the earliest ages to the present moment .

		It begins with the dances of the Egyptians and Hebrews , illustrating them from old reliefs and the conceptions of modern painters , and ends with
Loie Fuller	PERSON	and the modern ballet .

		In the Greek and Roman vases , reliefs , and figurines , and in the comments of con - temporaneous writers , the author finds ample mate - rial for his descriptions .

		It is a history of grace which we follow , and the variety and charm of its manifestations increase as the book proceeds .

		The Middle Ages and the Renaissance were prolific of ingenious devices to enhance the beauty of the dance , and many old manuscripts and engravings are drawn upon .

		There are descriptions of the Volte , the Parane , and the grand ballets in which Louis XIV .

		himself took part ; and these too are copiously and admirably illustrated .

		It is
France	LOCATION	that is con - sidered most carefully ; although the pastoral dances take one often to the land of
Teniers	ORGANIZATION	, and the im - portance and influence of the Spanish dances is readily acknowledged .

		A chapter is given to these fascinating , langorous , seductive figures of
Spain	LOCATION	, a chapter epitomized in the reproduction of
Sar	ORGANIZATION	- gent 's commanding and irresistible ''
Carmencita	PERSON	. ''

		Modern Greek dances , the Italian Tarantella , and the movement of the Bayaderes , are each described in turn .

		The American Indian , even , is not entirely neglected , though little is made of his curious rites .

		But the dances of civilization are primarily the theme of the book .

		The modern dances of society and of the theatre occupy much space , and are illus - trated in the most alluring manner by such men as
Whistler	LOCATION	,
Degas	LOCATION	, Carrier -
Bellense	PERSON	,
Renouard	ORGANIZATION	, and Che ` ret .

		In addition to those mentioned , there are plates in the book after
Carpeaux	LOCATION	,
Aime	ORGANIZATION	' ,
Morot	PERSON	,
Watteau	ORGANIZATION	,
Roybet	PERSON	,
Stewart	PERSON	, and others ; and near the beginning it is pleasant to find the little
MacMonnies Bacchante	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volume as a whole has infinite variety and inexhaustible charm .

		The large oblong folio volume entitled ''
London	LOCATION	as Seen by
Charles Dana Gibson	PERSON	'' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- strikes us as in one respect a little disappointing .

		A Lon - don flavor the book certainly has , but not a very pronounced one .

		Perhaps Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	was not long enough within the sound of Bow Bells to quite catch the true note either of '' Mayf air '' or the purlieus ; perhaps his peculiar manner has so fixed and stereotyped itself that he can not vary it mate - rially .

		At any rate , his
London	LOCATION	'' types '' show no marked departure from his familiar American ones .

		His
London	LOCATION	'' swell '' is his
New York	LOCATION	one , save for a slight Du Maurieresque touch superadded ; while his street characters have , in the same way , a differ - entiating savor of Phil
May	DATE	.

		But his pictures are nevertheless as delightful and entertaining as ever , and show that Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	has lost none of his peculiar charm and verve .

		They are classified under such heads as ''
London	LOCATION	Streets , '' '' Parks , '' '' Audiences , '' '' Salons '' and so on ; and they show us in a very graphic and spirited way at least the artist 's impressions and fancies of contemporary life let us say
London	LOCATION	life '' Gibsonized . ''

		And that is all that the title of the book warrants us in expecting .

		The volume is well made , and is easily one of the most striking of the season 's publications .

		The fiftieth year of
Longfellow	LOCATION	's '' Evangeline '' is fitly signalized by the appearance of an extremely pretty and attractive edition of the poem -LRB-
Hough	PERSON	- ton -RRB- , with an introduction by Miss
Alice Longfellow	PERSON	, and pictures and decorations by Miss
Jessie Wilcox Smith	PERSON	and
Miss Violet Oakley	ORGANIZATION	.

		One wishes the poet himself could see this captivating little volume , than which there is no more dainty or artistic gift - book on our list .

		The illustrations comprise ten full-page drawings in color , and a generous number of quaintly fancied headpieces in red and black .

		The artists are pupils of Mr.
Howard Pyle	PERSON	, who has good reason to plume himself on their work , and does so in a brief introductory note .

		It is a long time since we have seen anything prettier in its way than
Miss Smith	ORGANIZATION	's drawing of
Evangeline	LOCATION	, in the frontispiece illustrative of the line , '' Fair in sooth was the maiden . ''

		The delicate face suggests a miniature on ivory , and the very slightly conven - tionalized landscape has a pleasingly poetical effect .

		No less meritorious artistically is the final plate showing
Evangeline	PERSON	as a Sister of Mercy kneeling at the bedside of the dying Gabriel .

		The entire pictorial series leaves an agreeable impression of feminine delicacy and refinement , and one does not regret the absence of realism or the striving after the literal fact in the treatment .

		Mr.
Longfellow	PERSON	's
Evangeline	PERSON	and
Gabriel	PERSON	are certainly not French - Canadian rustics or '' Habitant '' farm-folks as we know them ; and we see no good reason why his illustrators should give us plain prose where he has given us poetry .

		Miss
Oakley	PERSON	's headpieces are nicely done , and are unmistakably in the manner of Mr.
Pyle	PERSON	without being mere imitations .

		In her foreword ,
Miss Longfellow	PERSON	sketches the history of the poem , and chats pleasantly of her father .

		The cover is in dark-green and gold scarcely delicate enough in design , we think , to match harmoniously the pictorial ensemble .

		Mr.
Walter Crane	PERSON	's graceful pencil has been em - ployed to advantage in the lavish decoration of
Messrs. Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	' dainty Holiday edition of
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	's `` The
Shepheard	ORGANIZATION	's Calender . ''

		There are twelve quaint full-page plates , one to each ''
Aeg	ORGANIZATION	- logue '' ; and the text on each page is set in a frame of conventionalized vines and foliage gracefully in - tertwined .

		Besides the Eclogues , the volume con - tains
E. K.	PERSON	's Epistle to
Gabriel Harvey	PERSON	, the `` Gen - eral Argument , '' two pages of Notes , and a Glossary .

		1897 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL The text is printed on rather thick hand-made paper just touched with a creamy parchment tint that strengthens the pleasantly archaic impression of the whole .

		The cover is of sea-green linen stamped with a charming design in colors , that shows us some `` vacant shepherd of the dale '' piping to his flock , while his dog stands at his side and a pair of white doves are cooing and courting in the branches over - head .

		Mr.
Crane	PERSON	's designs are instinct with the spirit of the sweet and quaint old verses , and his '' Cuddies '' and '' Perigots '' and ''
Colin Clouts	PERSON	'' are true shepherds of the ancient pastoral , and such as old Spenser himself might have conceived .

		The little volume is in flawless taste throughout , and has all the essentials of the specific gift-book .

		In a handsome volume of 490 pages , Colonel
Henry Inman	PERSON	, a veteran officer of our
Regular Army	ORGANIZATION	, tells the story of '' The Old Santa Fe '' Trail '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It can scarcely fail to occur to the thoughtful reader of this engrossing book that the current conception of American history , as gained from the text-books and manuals in common use , is singularly narrow and one-sided .

		The story of the magnificent pioneering exploits of the Spaniards , and of our own subsequent conquest and develop - ment of the vast Western and Southwestern territory which they were the first to enter and to settle , has been curiously neglected .

		There is no chapter in this story that is richer in the essential elements of romance , or of greater and more absorbing interest to the American reader , than the one contained in
Colonel Inman	LOCATION	's book .

		The Old Santa F < 5 Trail was once the great highway from the lower Mis - souri River to
New Mexico	LOCATION	.

		The first European to traverse it was De Vaca , a Spanish explorer of the sixteenth century .

		De Vaca was the precursor of the later caravans of pack-mules and '' prairie - schooners , '' which in their turn gave way to the swift trains of the great
Atchison	PERSON	,
Topeka	LOCATION	and
Santa Fe * Railway	ORGANIZATION	, which now spans the continent , and for nigh a thousand miles of its romantic course par - allels and often coincides with the Old Trail .

		Thus the tourist who is whirled in a palace car over this route is traversing storied ground , where nearly every stream and hill and dale has its tale of peril or adventure .

		The thrilling story of the Old Trail and its doughty heroes , '' Kit ''
Carson	PERSON	,
Beckwourth	LOCATION	,
Wooton	PERSON	,
Maxwell	PERSON	, etc. , is told sympathetically and in full detail by
Colonel Inman	ORGANIZATION	.

		His book has a distinct historical value , and it is as readable as a romance of Scott or
Stevenson	PERSON	.

		It is a book wherein American patriotism and national pride may find true nourishment ; and therefore it is a book that every American youth ought to read .

		Print and paper are notably good , and the eight full-page photogravure plates from drawings by Mr.
Frederick Remington	PERSON	are in some respects the best work that we have seen from his truth-telling pencil .

		Besides these plates there are many illustrative initials and tail-pieces by Mr.
Thomson	PERSON	Willing .

		A good map of the Old Trail greatly aids the imagination of the reader .

		We heartily commend this book as a speci - ally useful and acceptable gift to a well-grown boy .

		We venture to say that he will read it and re-read it , and acquire thereby an indelible impression of an important phase of his country 's history .

		The rich exterior , liberal pictorial attractions , and universally engaging theme of Mr.
Justin Mc	PERSON	-
Carthy	PERSON	's `` Life of Gladstone '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- have led us to include it in the present category , though it calls for much fuller treatment than can be ac - corded it here .

		To our thinking , Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	's facile pen has never been employed better than in this engaging volume .

		The theme was eminently one to his taste , and one that he was in some respects exceptionally qualified to handle .

		He had studied Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	's career as it progressed , step by step , ever since he was old enough to take an interest in public affairs ; he had sat by his side in the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	for many years ; he had borne an active part in some of the great parliamentary battles with which Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	's name is most intimately asso - ciated ; he had advised with him frequently , and been admitted to his friendship .

		To those who have read Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	's histories of our own times , we may say that his life of
Gladstone	PERSON	is very similar in treatment to those pleasantly informing books .

		There is the same rapid yet discriminating touch , the same reminiscential , almost chatty , tone .

		The book is rich in brief and pithy characterizations of men and measures , and abounds in those striking turns of thought and phrase that fix the attention and stamp themselves on the memory .

		We heartily commend this spirited account of the greatest En - glish statesman perhaps one may say Englishman of Victorian times to those in quest of a gift - book of the more substantial sort .

		There are a great variety of portraits and other illustrations , full-page and vignette . ''

		The Madonna in Art '' -LRB-
L. C. Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Miss
Estelle M. Hurll	PERSON	, is a condensed review of the varying methods of treating this enduring subject .

		The work does not pretend to be either critical or technical ; it is merely a popular treatise on a pop - ular subject .

		The material is interesting and the author is well-informed , these are the merits of the book ; but if she had the courage of her opin - ions it would have more individuality .

		In a way , everything is reduced to a level ; and the conven - tional and traditional judgments are the ones usually expressed .

		It is not a subject which easily calls forth originality , yet it has been so profoundly studied that a new consideration of it needs to be justified by a very personal point of view .

		The author 's classification of the pictures is curious and a little distracting .

		Instead of grouping them by periods or by schools , she divides them by certain characteristics of the pictures themselves , devoting one chapter to the
Madonna	ORGANIZATION	enthroned , another to the pastoral
Madonna	ORGANIZATION	, and grouping the others by similar schemes .

		In the second part of the book , the classification is a little more spiritual .

		But it is a confusing system , which leaves one with no very definite impression of anything .

		The book is not a 394 -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, study , it is familiar description ; and some of it is well written .

		It is illustrated with many inferior reproductions of masterpieces , and adorned with a cover in the
Virgin	ORGANIZATION	's colors .

		Mr.
William Nicholson	PERSON	is to the fore this year , following up rapidly the great success of his jubilee portrait of the Queen .

		In addition to his clever '' Alphabet '' mentioned in our last issue , he pub - lishes `` An Almanac '' -LRB- Russell -RRB- , with words by Mr.
Rudyard Kipling	PERSON	.

		The twelve drawings are bril - liantly individual , for Mr.
Nicholson	PERSON	's style is all his own ; the character in his figures is expressed as no one else would express it .

		They are drawn in broad sweeps of the brush , with a bit of color to enliven the blacks and browns , but with few lines , and those very expressive .

		The personality is be - fore one , convincingly , vividly , the impression of it , within as well as without .

		You are made to understand what manner of man is before you .

		There is action in the figures , or the repose after action , and the dogs and horses are alive and in full cry .

		The originality of the work is extraordi - nary and delightful .

		Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's verses are , most of them , pleasant nonsense , but the one on '' Boxing '' goes deeper . ''

		Read here the Moral roundly writ For him that into battle goes Each soul that , hitting hard and hit , Encounters gross or ghostly foes : Prince , blown by many overthrows Half blind with shame , half choked with dirt Man can not tell but Allah knows How much the other side was hurt ! ''

		A fitting gift-book for a friend of sportsmanlike proclivities may be found in '' The Gallinaceous Game Birds of
North America	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Francis P. Har	PERSON	- per -RRB- .

		Forty-four species are included , beginning with ''
Bob White	PERSON	'' and ending with the wild turkey ; and each is illustrated in an admirable engraving executed by Mr.
Edwin Sheppard	PERSON	.

		A color-chart and a key for the identification of the species are also given .

		The text is by Dr.
Daniel G. Elliot	PERSON	, and is all that we might expect from the hand of one distinguished by a lifetime of wide and careful re - search in various departments of ornithology .

		It is intended primarily for the advantage of the sportsman , and the author writes with keen enthu - siasm of the qualities that constitute a noble game - bird .

		Chiefly on account of the traits which give zest to the pastime of the hunter , Dr.
Elliot	PERSON	assigns to the gallinaceous birds the first and most import - ant place among the feathered tribes .

		None can dispute their value in the history of mankind .

		Dr.
Coues	PERSON	lends credence to the statement that '' the total output of the poultry industry , in the shape of hens ' eggs alone , exceeds annually that of all the mines of gold , silver , and other precious metals . ''

		The annual crop of feathers derived from the gal - linaceous birds forms no inconsiderable item in the commerce of the world .

		The race can boast like - wise of varied and extreme beauty of attire , and of many intelligent and attractive characteristics ; and yet the genuine lover of the `` tribes of burning - plumage and of choral voice , '' who is content to follow them with an opera-glass instead of a fowling - piece , will experience a shock of surprise that one who has known them long and intimately can pre - fer such a fall before the gun to those that delight the artistic sense alone with their grace of bearing and charm of song .

		Dr.
Elliot	PERSON	treats his theme in an easy , masterful manner , keeping it at every point within the comprehension of the average reader .

		Eight full-page drawings by Mr.
Louis Agassiz Fuertes	PERSON	, the artist who seems to be a genuine suc - cessor to Audubon in the use of the pencil , embel - lish the series of studies made by Mr.
H. E. Park	PERSON	- hurst of `` Song Birds and Water Fowl '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		The author has been a persistent and keen observer of bird-life , as this work and his '' Birds ' Calendar , '' produced
several years ago	DATE	, attest .

		Several chap - ters in the present work are devoted to water birds ; one is occupied with birds ' nests , another with '' Mis - tress Cuckoo , '' and one with a big `` bouquet of song birds . ''

		Fresh and racy in flavor , and deftly rhymed , are the verses in the pretty book entitled `` The Habit - ant , and Other French-Canadian Poems '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , by Dr.
Henry Drummond	PERSON	.

		Our readers are not unfamiliar with the pleasant qualities of Dr. Drum - mond 's verse and the selections in the present vol - ume show him at his best .

		The queer French - Canadian dialect is capitally reproduced , with an effect sometimes comic and sometimes extremely pleasing and poetical , owing mainly , perhaps , to the frequent use of pretty French words in place of their harsher English equivalents .

		The following stanzas , descriptive of
Spring	DATE	, may serve as samples of Dr.
Drummond	PERSON	's verse , and of '' English as she is spoke '' by the '' Habitants '' in the lower Province : '' Dat 's very nice tarn for wake upon de morning An ' lissen de rossignol sing ev ` ry place , Fal sout ' win ' a-blowin ' see clover a-growin ' An ' all de worl ' laughin ' itself on de face . ''

		Mos ' ev'ry raf ' it is pass on de rapide De voyageurs singin ' some ole chanson ' Bout girl down de reever too bad dey mus ' leave her , But comiu ' back soon wit ' beaucoup d'argent . ''

		The volume contains an Introduction by Mr.
Louis Frechette	PERSON	, the French - Canadian poet-laureate ; and the eleven full-page plates in photogravure and illustrative vignettes , one for each poem , serve to rank it well up among the prettier gift-books of the season .

		A careful work upon `` Portrait Miniatures '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is written by Mr.
George C. William	PERSON	- son , Litt.D .

		The subject is studied from the time of
Holbein	LOCATION	,
1531	DATE	, to that of Sir
William Ross	PERSON	,
1860	DATE	.

		Yet the author does not pretend to compete with Dr.
Propert	PERSON	's work on the same subject , but appeals to a class for which the latter is too sumptuous to be accessible .

		Without pretending to be final or infallible , he has prepared his treatise carefully on a basis of sound knowledge and wide experience .

		It is addressed to the collector who is still something of a novice , and it contains much special and even technical information which he would find invalua -

		THE DIAL ble .

		It has an attraction , too , even for the indif - ferent , and the unwary may be led into temptation by a perusal of its absorbing pages , in which nothing is of so much importance as the correct identifica - tion of a miniature .

		It is largely a history of English miniaturists , only one brief chapter being devoted to continental painters .

		But the author 's researches have been so extensive that some new material has been brought to light , and he is able to give in - teresting descriptions of the careers of the early painters .

		We find that the successful miniaturist of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries was a man of mark who held his own with , the distinguished men of the day .

		Not only the great ladies of the land , but the courtiers and statesmen , sat for Rich - ard Cosway and
Andrew Plimer	PERSON	.

		Their studios were filled with the importunate great , and the for - tunes they gained enabled them to live in luxury .

		Cosway , however , in spite of his success , was much ridiculed by the wits of the day because of '' his luxurious habits , his dandified and elaborate costume , and his fondness for wearing a sword . ''

		Mr.
Wil	PERSON	- liamson tells these stories gaily , and his clear simple style is excellent .

		The work of the different paint - ers is differentiated with lucidity and justice .

		We feel that he knows his subject and is impatient of any degradation .

		The book is illustrated with in - numerable reproductions of miniatures in the most famous collections , a still more tangible suggestion of the beauty and delicacy of this exquisite art .

		There are doubtless more sumptuous books for the holidays than those published by Mr.
Thomas B. Mosher	PERSON	, of
Portland	LOCATION	, but assuredly there are none that are in the strictest sense more choice , more satisfactory to the instincts of refined lovers of books , or more ideally adapted for use as Christmas remem - brances .

		Mr.
Mosher	PERSON	's list for the present season includes ten new numbers .

		The '' Old World '' series is represented by the sonnets of
Michael Angelo	PERSON	, in the translation of the late
John Addington Symonds	PERSON	; Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	's ''
Helen	PERSON	of Troy , '' including the author 's essay on the myth of
Helen	PERSON	, omitted from the earlier American reprint ; Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's '' Atalanta in Calydon , '' which needs no word of comment or praise ; and the '' Sonnets from the Portuguese , '' of which we can not have too many editions .

		Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	's essay , reprinted from '' Critical Kit-Kats , '' serves a & a preface to this edition of Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	's sonnets .

		To the '' Bibelot '' series , two additions are made .

		One of them is the '' Long Ago '' of the two ladies who write under the name of ''
Michael Field	PERSON	. ''

		This exquisite book , heretofore printed in an edition limited to one hundred copies , is an attempt to extend the Sapphic fragments into complete lyrics : a bold undertaking , certainly , but not without a certain measure of relative success in the performance .

		The other '' Bibelot '' is '' An Italian Garden , '' a book of lyrics by
Madame James Darmesteter	PERSON	-LRB- A.
Mary F. Robinson	PERSON	-RRB- .

		In the '' Brocade '' series , we have three new booklets printed on
Japan	LOCATION	vellum .

		The first is
Walter Pater	PERSON	's version of the Cupid and Psyche story from
Apuleius	LOCATION	, known to all readers of ''
Marius	PERSON	the Epicurean , '' and particularly deserving of this detachment from its setting .

		The second is '' The Story without an End , '' translated from the German of
F. W. Carove	ORGANIZATION	by
Sarah Austin	PERSON	, and first published in
London	LOCATION	in
1834	DATE	.

		The third is a translation , by Miss Lucie Page , of the two famous prose poems , '' The Centaur '' and '' The Bacchante , '' by
Maurice de Gue	ORGANIZATION	`` rin .

		The last of Mr.
Mosher	PERSON	's publications to be mentioned is the most important of all .

		It begins a new series called '' Reprints of Privately Printed Books , '' and gives us the nine essays in literary criticism contributed anonymously by
Walter Pater	PERSON	to '' The Guardian . ''

		These were rescued about a year ago from the files of the periodical for which they were written , and , at the instance of Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	, were printed in a private edition of one hundred copies .

		Mr.
Mosher	PERSON	's present reprint of the book is as close a facsimile as it is possible to produce without the aid of photography .

		It is an exquisite book , and will be cherished by all who are fortunate enough to secure it .

		Mr.
W. G. Colesworthy	PERSON	, a
Boston	LOCATION	publisher , has followed rather closely the example set by Mr.
Mosher	PERSON	, and put forth a very pretty volume of poems by
Rossetti	PERSON	. ''

		The White Ship : A Little Book of Poems '' is the title of this charming pub - lication , which is printed in italic type on hand - made paper , and bound in boards with white back and blue sides .

		The margins are wider than those affected by Mr.
Mosher	PERSON	, but the book is otherwise very similar to the familiar '' Bibelot '' and '' Old World '' publications .

		What could be more appropriate for a Christmas book than a study of the great epic of the Christian life ?

		Such a study is offered us in ''
Dante	PERSON	's Vision of God '' -LRB-
Scott , Foresman & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , an essay by Mrs.
Caroline K. Sherman	PERSON	, published in a pretty brochure , with an exquisitely designed rose for adornment of the board cover .

		Mrs.
Sherman	PERSON	's paper is a sym - pathetic and gracefully-written interpretative study of that revelation of the divine which
Dante	ORGANIZATION	clothed with such splendor of imaginative and harmonious diction , and which is essentially one with the ulti - mate message of all the great philosophers , from Plato to Spinoza . ''

		Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God , '' so runs the deepest of the Beatitudes , and the `` Paradiso '' shows us what the promise meant to that poet whose intensity of spir - itual vision has never been equalled in literature .

		From the consideration of this * ' vision , '' the writer is led , in conclusion , to a fine statement of the mes - sage which
Dante	ORGANIZATION	has for all ages , and most of all for our own . ''

		It is the message of an age , poor in science , but wonderfully rich in spiritual worth , to an age rich in science , but too often forgetful of the fact that material good has its highest value only as it is transmuted into spiritual power . ''

		The illus - trative extracts included in this booklet are taken from
Gary and Longfellow	PERSON	, and -LRB- for the original -RRB- from what is essentially the text of the
Oxford Dante	ORGANIZATION	.

		Our only quarrel is with the essayist 's spell - 396 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, ing of Virgil with an '' e , '' a vagary against which we always feel bound to protest .

		There are a few vexatious misprints in the Italian text . ''

		A Book of Old English Love Songs '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- is one of the more artistic and charming of the holiday gift-books .

		It is enriched with an ornate gilt cover and many decorative drawings by Mr.
George Wharton Edwards	PERSON	.

		They have grace and beauty , these designs , and they adjust them - selves admirably to the rich and exquisite loveliness of the fine old songs .

		The familiar ones are printed from
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Jonson	PERSON	,
Waller	PERSON	,
Herrick	PERSON	, and others , and they are the more welcome because we know them .

		The list includes also some songs less familiar , but too fine to merit our forgetfulness .

		Mr.
Hamilton Wright Mabie	PERSON	has written a grace - ful introduction .

		The elegantly ornate setting bestowed by its pub - lishers on Mr.
Archer M. Huntington	PERSON	's `` A Note - Book in
Northern Spain	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- seems to war - rant the inclusion of the work in the present cate - gory .

		Mr.
Huntington	PERSON	is a good observer , and his book rises in style as well as substance above the average of its class .

		His view of
Spain	LOCATION	is tinged with sentiment , and is rather favorable on the whole .

		Her decline from her ancient high estate to her pres - sent low rating among European nations he attrib - utes to her lack of the trading spirit .

		For seven centuries she was a battlefield , employing the flower of her manhood and draining her resources in bar - ring the gate of the Christian fold against the Mo - hammedan wolf .

		While she was fighting , the more fortunately situated nations to the north of her were trading and intermingling and gradually evolving the modern form of industrial civilization , with its corollaries , political freedom , tolerance , a recogni - tion of the dignity and worth of labor .


Spain	LOCATION	fell far behind in the race of national development ; and she stands to-day a belated mediaeval figure strangely tricked out in certain ill-worn odds and ends of mod - ern political bravery , rich in nothing save in that inextinguishable pride '' which she to all the earth May largely give , nor fear herself a dearth . ''

		Up to the beginning of the present Cuban war , as Mr.
Huntington	PERSON	thinks , a somewhat better condition of things seemed likely to prevail .

		A tendency to develope on certain modern lines was growingly manifest ; and even now , in perhaps the darkest hour that
Spain	LOCATION	has known , there is that in the essential character of her people that fosters a faith in her ultimate progress .

		The volume is clearly printed on calendered paper , and contains one hundred illus - trations of good quality .

		One of the interesting features of the Holiday publishing season for many years has been the an - nual selection of Christmas cards and calendars issued by
Messrs. L. Prang & Co.	ORGANIZATION	of
Boston	LOCATION	.

		Their productions for this season are even more attractive than usual , consisting of about a score of new Christ - mas cards , each with appropriate floral design in colors , and an equal number of artistic calendars .

		Among the latter may be mentioned , as especially pleasing , '' Dream Roses , '' designed by Miss
Laura C. Hills	PERSON	; '' Daisies Dear , '' '' Dream Pansies , '' and `` Forget-me-not , '' by Miss Bessie Gray ; and '' Queenly Roses , '' '' The Sea Shore Calendar , '' and '' My Lady Pansy , '' by various other artists .

		It is interesting to note that all of
Messrs. Prang & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's publica - tions are designed , lithographed , and printed in this country .

		Mr.
John Corbin	PERSON	's articles in ''
Harper	PERSON	's Round Table '' on '' School Boy Life in
England	LOCATION	'' are now issued by the same firm in book form .

		Mr.
Corbin	PERSON	describes in an interesting way life at the great public schools of
Winchester	ORGANIZATION	,
Eton	LOCATION	, and Rugby , and draws some instructive comparisons between the English system and our own .

		A public school in
England	LOCATION	is not , of course , as with us , a school to which any - one is free to go without paying .

		Such a school is there termed a national school , our own nearest equivalent to the English public school being the big preparatory school , such as
Andover	LOCATION	,
Exeter	LOCATION	, St.
Paul	PERSON	's ,
Groton	LOCATION	, etc. .

		Mr.
Corbin	PERSON	prepared himself for his task by going to live for a short period at
Winchester	ORGANIZATION	,
Eton	LOCATION	, and Rugby , where he lost no opportunity of associating and conversing with the masters and boys and of getting as near to their actual life as possible .

		The book deals less with the strictly scholastic than with the social side of this life ; and we need scarcely say that the formative influence of the latter side upon the character of the English public-school boy is as potent as that of the former .

		Dr.
Arnold	PERSON	of Rugby saw this fact very clearly ; and it was in the '' houses '' and on the playground , even more than in the class-room , that his gracious and elevating influence was felt .

		Besides giving us the fruit of his own observations , Mr.
Corbin	PERSON	has consulted the authorities ; and he has revised and somewhat enlarged his '' Round Table '' articles to fit them for book form .

		His treat - ment is critical as well as descriptive ; and his little book should interest and amuse young readers as well as adults .

		It is tastefully gotten up , and the eighteen photographic plates are well chosen and well made .

		In '' Social Life in Old
Virginia	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , Mr.
Thomas Nelson	PERSON	Page has tried to give a picture of the lovely side of the Southern civilization before the War .

		His preface deplores the fact that so much of our conception of the South at that time is derived from Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	; and the descriptions that follow are naturally far more genial .

		It is well to have this plantation life which has passed away the most picturesque and courtly that our country has ever known thus portrayed for us by one who was born to its traditions .

		The illus - trations , by the
Misses Cowles	LOCATION	, admirably suggest the grace and beauty of the
Southern	ORGANIZATION	life and its strange contrasts .

		Miss
H. A. Guerber	PERSON	, author of the popular little book on the `` Stories of the
Wagner Opera	ORGANIZATION	, '' now offers a kindred one entitled `` Stories of Famous Operas '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , briefly outlining the
1897	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 397 plots of the favorite French , German , and Italian operas .

		The narratives are taken from the orig - inal librettos , and are so written as to enable the reader to follow in fancy the action of the piece in all its details precisely as it is given on the stage .

		The titles comprise
Faust	LOCATION	,
Carmen	PERSON	, A'ida , The Huguenots ,
Don Giovanni	PERSON	,
Fidelio	LOCATION	, Mignon , Le Cid ,
Martha	PERSON	,
Norma	PERSON	,
Cavalleria Busticana	LOCATION	, etc. .

		Besides outlining the dramatic action , the author gives a few leading facts as to composers .

		The publishers have mounted the book attractively , the illustrations comprising portraits , striking dramatic scenes , views of famous theatres , etc. .

		The volume is pleasantly written , and its uses are obvious .

		Miss
Mary E. Phillips	PERSON	has prepared a volume of '' Reminiscences of
William Wetmore	PERSON	Story '' -LRB-
Rand	ORGANIZATION	,
McNally & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- which , without pretending to be a biography , provides an outline sketch of the life of the famous sculptor and man of letters . ''

		Incidents and anecdotes chronologically arranged , '' is the author 's modest description of her work .

		The let - ters and reminiscences of Story 's contemporaries , both published and unpublished , have been liberally drawn upon for material , and both
Browning	PERSON	and
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	figure conspicuously among the friends upon whom tribute is levied .

		The book is handsomely illustrated , and made attractive both by its mechan - ical execution and the loyalty of friendship that informs its contents .

		We have testified more than once to the merits of
New York	LOCATION	's sprightly little periodical , '' Life , '' which is , in this country certainly , without a rival in its peculiar field .

		Its pictures are artistic , and often charming ; its tone is refined ; it bubbles over with fun that is never coarse or offensive ; in short , it is a paper that ladies and gentlemen may read , and no one need shun .

		It bears much the same rela - tion to its respectable
London	LOCATION	prototype , '' Punch , '' that a glass of champagne does to a pot of rather flat porter .

		The
Scribners	ORGANIZATION	now issue a '' second series '' of selected pictures from `` Life , '' under the title '' Life 's Comedy . ''

		There are 150 pictures in all , and they are divided into four groups , '' Belles and Beaux , '' '' In Cupid 's Realm , '' '' Fads and Fan - cies , '' '' Out of Doors . ''

		They are worthy of their new setting ; and the comely volume containing them forms a capital means of enlivening an even - ing and diverting a group of one 's friends .

		`` Flying Leaves '' -LRB-
E. R. Herrick & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the title of a thin oblong quarto volume containing char - acteristic selections from that sometimes really artist - ic and usually excruciatingly funny German weekly , '' Fliegende JBlaetter . ''

		The specimens given are fairly representative ones , but they are rather coarse - ly reproduced .

		The volume will form an acceptable present for those who enjoy the humorous side of things .

		Mr.
Elbert Hubbard	PERSON	's '' Little Journeys to the Homes of Famous Women '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- give some interesting accounts of the homes of Mrs.
Brown	PERSON	- ing ,
Jane Austen	PERSON	,
Miss Martineau	PERSON	,
Mary Lamb	PERSON	,
Christina Rossetti	PERSON	,
Madame de Stae	ORGANIZATION	* !

		,
Empress Josephine	PERSON	, and other famous women ; and to each paper is prefixed a portrait of its heroine .

		These portraits are well made and interesting especially those in the quaint plate showing
Charles	PERSON	and
Mary Lamb	PERSON	.

		Besides the local descriptions , the papers contain much pleasant biographical chat and anec - dote , and literary and general criticisms .

		The
Stokes Company	ORGANIZATION	publish a second and modified edition of Professor AtwelFs selected '' Pensees of
Joubert	PERSON	. ''

		This time the original French is omitted , and the volume is reduced in size to a pocketable booklet of 135 tiny pages , ex - clusive of the brief biographical and appreciative Introduction .

		It has a portrait and an index .

		The dainty pages fairly sparkle with felicities of thought and diction , and amply warrant the saying of Mr.
Ludlow	PERSON	, who introduced the author to English read - ers , that '' to glance over
Joubert	PERSON	's Pensbes is like uncovering a tray of diamonds . ''

		Mrs.
Lucia A. Palmer	PERSON	's `` Oriental Days '' -LRB-
Baker	PERSON	and
Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a book of travels in
Egypt	LOCATION	and the Holy Land , wherein the writer recounts her own rather slender experiences , and ekes out the recital with Various remnants of information , histor - ical , political , and archaeological , culled from various authorities .

		The volume is a royal octavo , well printed and ornately bound , and enriched with full - page photographic plates .

		Mr.
H. C. Christy	PERSON	has been ambitious enough to illustrate `` Hamlet '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- , but he has nothing new to say upon the subject .

		The drawings are not without cleverness , but they are not Hamlet .

		And one shrinks from the touch of any but the greatest hands upon that masterpiece .

		The Ophelia of this artist is almost ludicrous , and the Prince nearly as bad .

		It is much better to imagine them .

		The King , in the frontispiece and on page 149 , is conceived much more effectively .

		It was a happy idea to have
Madeleine Lemaire	PERSON	illustrate '' Lucile '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , if the idea of re - printing the poem can be said to be happy , for her pretty sentimentality is well adapted to the false emotions and sing-song rhythm of
Owen Meredith	PERSON	's great effort .

		The water-colors are well reproduced in color , and the drawings in black-and - white , by Mr.
C. McCormick Rogers	PERSON	, are fairly good .

		Anew edition of
Sterne	PERSON	's '' Sentimental Journey '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- is decorated with many clever designs by Mr.
T. H. Robinson	PERSON	, which are almost as charm - ingly beguiling as the text .

		This edition will doubt - less prove a favorite with the lovers of this genial classic .

		It is fastidiously printed , and has the bibliographical merit of being an exact reprint of the first edition -LRB- that of
1768	DATE	, in two volumes -RRB- , the only changes or alterations being the correction of a few obvious errors of the printer .

		A book of photographic views of '' Central
Berk	PERSON	- shire '' -LRB-
Pittsfield	LOCATION	:
George Blatchford	PERSON	-RRB- gives an idea of the beauty of these
Massachusetts	LOCATION	hills and villages .

		The pictures are admirably taken , and suggest the peaceful loveliness of that rare country .

		398 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, BOOKS FOR THE YOUNG .

		u .

		The fairies are sadly neglected by this year 's writers , who should therefore live in fear of their revenge .

		For the fairies can endure neglect much better than the writers can ; they are perennial , they are eternally lov - able , while the poor author is but the creature of a day .

		If he wishes to lengthen his short span of life , he must invoke their aid , he must ingratiate himself with them .

		Yet only a few out of the crowd have been wise enough to appreciate this truth .

		The real thing reaches us this year from the far north , as it did once before when
Andersen	PERSON	led the enchanted children into a beautiful new country .

		These '' Fairy Tales from the Far North '' -LRB-
A. C. Armstrong & Son	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- were written by
P. C. Asbjorn	PERSON	- sen , and translated from the Norwegian by Mr.
H. L. Brakstad	PERSON	, who has given us other folk-stories by this writer .

		The original illustrations by
Sinding	PERSON	and
Weren	PERSON	- skiold are reproduced , and they translate the spirit of the stories much more sympathetically than foreigners could have done .

		The ever-present troll would have been a difficult subject to one who was not familiar with him from childhood .

		The author 's invention never flags ; his plots are extraordinarily rich in incident , too varied sometimes , too abrupt in their changes .

		Yet they do not allow one 's interest to abate , and they are told with unusual vivacity .

		Though they have some of the delight - ful old characters common to all folk-lore , they are in - tensely , almost aggressively , original .

		Children would be continually diverted by their surprises .

		Their directness is sometimes harsh and their simplicity curt , yet it is extraordinary work .

		We know of nothing quite like it .

		There is much humor , sometimes rather grim , in the tales , but they have not the tenderness of
Andersen	PERSON	's , nor his occasional sentimentality , nor his large-hearted human sympathy . ''

		The Pink Fairy Book '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , edited by the indefatigable Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	, has a pretty cover , and excellent illustrations by Mr.
H. J. Ford	PERSON	.

		The Japanese stories in the book are a new and pleasant element , and there are many Sicilian tales and some from the Spanish , the Danish , and the French .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	draws also upon
Andersen	PERSON	and the brothers
Grimm	PERSON	; and he makes a very readable book .

		`` The Flame-Flower , and other Stories '' -LRB- Dent-Lip - pincott -RRB- is attractive at first glance , because of the orig - inality , the humor , and the decorative ingenuity of the illustrations .

		And as the artist , Mr.
James F. Sullivan	PERSON	, is also the writer , one looks for the same qualities in the stories and finds them .

		Their presence makes the strange tales even more interesting to adults than to children , but there is much in them also to appeal to the latter .

		Even though it would be difficult to make the story of ''
Bob Robinson	PERSON	's Baby '' as clever as its illustrations , it will delight them .

		The parody of Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	will be funny only to maturer children , per - haps , but everyone can appreciate the cleverness of '' The Lost Idea , '' if not its delicate satire . ''

		Here They Are ! ''

		-LRB- Longmans -RRB- , by the same author , is less captivating , but no less ingenious .

		The story of '' The Blue Thing with White Dots , '' from
Noah	PERSON	's Ark , is particularly funny in its description of the wooden
Noah	PERSON	's perplexity in re - gard to his own identity .

		And the history of '' Snit , '' the mouse , together with the drawings for it , is delightful .

		In '' Prince Uno '' -LRB-
Doubleday & McClure	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Uncle Frank , who is only an ordinary mortal , takes a journey into Fairyland .

		The things he sees there , the people he meets , the adventures in which he participates , are de - scribed simply and gracefully ; and it is a pleasant , happy , gay little place he makes of it .

		The story was told orig - inally to help a small boy through the critical stage of an illness , and one follows it with a kind of eager inter - est in its power of diverting the invalid .

		This makes one impatient when it drags , and happy when it is gay and entertaining .

		The cover and illustrations , by Mr.
W. D. Stevens	PERSON	, are daintily pretty .

		The first story in '' The Slambangaree and Other Stories '' -LRB-
Russell	PERSON	-RRB- is literally a nightmare , for it relates the experiences of a little boy who ate too much plum - pudding and saw strange things in consequence .

		It is written by Mr.
R. K. Munkittrick	PERSON	, who has a lively fancy and a quaint sense of humor .

		The other stories are much less terrifying , as they have no connection with plum-pudding ; and they contain a good deal of human nature , pleasantly disguised as impossibility .

		The in - genuity of the plots is as extraordinary as the delight - fully direct manner in which they are elaborated . ''

		The Peasant King '' is an artistic tale , but it is not the only charming one in the clever little book .

		`` The Adventures of Mabel '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- , by Mr.
Raf	PERSON	- ford
Pyke	PERSON	, are chiefly with animals .

		The green lizard gives her a charm with which she can intimidate the fiercest wild creature and make him her friend .

		The originality lies in
Mabel	LOCATION	's oddly familiar intercourse with beasts and giants that would make other little girls tremble .

		The pictures by
Miss M. E. Norton	PERSON	are in broad masses of blacks and white , and have a good deal of character .

		Mr.
G. E. Farrow	PERSON	, the author of '' The Wallypug of Why , '' published last year , is less fortunate in the title of this year 's book , though anything would seem com - monplace after such an inspiration . ''

		The Missing Prince '' -LRB-
Dodd	PERSON	-RRB- begins with a toy wedding and ends with an experiment in flying ; and there are all sorts of idiosyncracies in between .

		One of the drollest charac - ters is the Advertiser-General , whose original ideas in his profession may be commended to those who are in - terested .

		There is plenty of fun , too , in the verses of the Public Rhymster ; and the entire book shows a large fund of ingenuity and humor .

		The drawings , by Mr.
Harry Furniss	PERSON	, fully carry out the drollery of the story . ''

		The
Cruikshank	PERSON	Fairy-Book '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- ought to be one of the most popular of the year , for it contains four of the good old stories told in the good old way . ''

		Puss in Boots , '' ''
Jack	PERSON	and the Beanstalk , '' '' Hop-o ' - my-Thumb , '' and `` Cinderella '' are always new ; and when the fine old
Cruikshank	PERSON	illustrations are printed with them , they become irresistible .

		The drawings have a delightful amount of action and character , and yet they are adroitly kept in harmony with the tales .

		This is much the most important of the year 's reprints .

Hawthorne	PERSON	's '' Tanglewood Tales '' and '' Tales from
Hans Andersen	PERSON	'' -LRB-

		The Muses up to Date '' -LRB-
Way & Williams	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a series of whimsical and actable plays for children by Mrs.
Henrietta Dexter Field	PERSON	and Mr.
Roswell Martin Field	PERSON	, might also be called a fairy-book .

		The plays are written partly in verse , and are designed to afford many oppor - tunities for artistic effects in costuming and grouping .

		Tableaux and dances are frequently introduced , and some of the situations would require very dexterous management .

		In the first play the Muses , discontented over the neglect of mortals , descend to earth and be -

		THE DIAL 399 come desperately modern , too vulgarly modern , in fact .

		The talk is slangy and very ridiculous , but except for the originality of the situation , its gay airiness is not particularly clever .

		The other plays are more interest - ing .

		The story of
Cinderella	LOCATION	is made into a charming drama , and later the same story is turned topsy turvy in an absurd little way , and our dear lady of the cinders made most disagreeable .

		There are clever things in '' Trouble in the Garden , '' which would make a pretty series of pictures .

		The book is well printed and rejoices in a charming cover by Mrs.
Alice Kellogg Tyler	PERSON	.

		There are two books still which have some connec - tion with fairyland . ''

		The Story of the Rhinegold '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- is told for young people by Miss
Anna Alice Chapin	PERSON	.

		It is
Wagner	PERSON	's version which she narrates , and she connects it directly with the operas by printing the chief musical motifs .

		The style is good , and though the story is a little intricate for very young children , it is admirably adapted for the initiation of older ones into the Wagnerian mysteries .

		The cover and illustrations have a dignity in keeping with the majesty of the stories .

		`` In Indian Tents '' -LRB-
Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- contains stories collected by Miss
Abby L. Alger	PERSON	, from the
Penobscot	LOCATION	,
Passama	LOCATION	- quoddy , and Micmac Indians .

		As stories they will in - terest children , and as folk-lore they will delight adults .

		They have peculiar quaintness and originality and direct - ness .

		They have even a certain majesty .

		There is something superbly elemental about '' The Creation , '' and in all of them we go back to nature and to the emotions common to all humanity .

		Many good picture-books will enliven the holiday tables this year ; and of these , three are musical . ''

		The
Stevenson	PERSON	Song-Book '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is a little outside of that category , as it is decorated with pretty convention - alized designs in black and white , and a charming cover in delicate colors .

		The poems are selected from the '' Child 's Garden of Verses , '' and the music is written by such well-known composers as Mr.
G. W. Chadwick	PERSON	, Mr.
Arthur Foote	PERSON	, Mr.
Reginald de Koven	PERSON	, Mr.
W. W. Gilchrist	PERSON	, and Dr.
C. Villiers Stanford	ORGANIZATION	.

		The simple lyrical verses are the most charming things that ever a child could sing .

		The late
H. C. Bunner	PERSON	's '' Three Operettas '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- contains gay little musical plays , designed to be acted and sung by children . ''

		The Three Little Kittens of the Land of Pie '' relates ingeniously the adventures of those unfortunate pussies who lost their mittens and therefore could have no pie .

		It is bright and amusing and would be pretty in action .

		The plot is absurd , but not too absurd to be diverting .

		And the verses in this , as in the others , have a decided swing to them .

		The little songs are gay and catchy . ''

		Bobby Shaftoe '' is the centre of one of the operettas , and the third weaves an ingenious plot around '' The Seven Old Ladies of
Laven	PERSON	- der Town . ''

		The music is by Mr.
Oscar Weil	PERSON	, and the illustrations are drawn by Mr.
C. D. Weldon	PERSON	and Mr.
C. J. Taylor	PERSON	.

		The cover is strikingly clever . ''

		Singing Verses for Children '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a product of
Chicago	LOCATION	, as the simple pretty verses were written by Mrs.
Lydia Avery Coonley	PERSON	, the music by Miss
Eleanor Smith	PERSON	,
Miss Jessie L. Gaynor	PERSON	, Mr.
Frederic W. Root	PERSON	, and Mr.
Frank H. Atkinson	PERSON	, Jr. ; and the illustra - tions are the work of Mrs.
Alice Kellogg Tyler	PERSON	.

		It is easy to see that the entire book is made by lovers of children , so gentle and sweet is the conception , so tenderly sympathetic the execution .

		Some of the verses are charmingly naive , and the composers have tried to maintain the spirit of fresh simplicity .

		But the most delightful thing about the book is Mrs.
Tyler	PERSON	's decora - tion in color .

		The pictures are simple , but they are also imaginative , and they show an exquisite understanding of child life .

		In addition , they are the work of an artist , so that in color and design they are admirable .

		The decorative borders for the music are even lovelier than the pictures .

		The designs for the sunshine , wind , and dancing songs , for '' My Pegasus '' and '' Clouds , '' are particularly happy .

		And there is character in all of them , and beauty .

		Mr.
Frank Dempster Sherman	PERSON	's '' Little-Folk Lyrics '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- are not set to music , though some of them sing themselves naturally .

		The .

		`` Lullaby , '' with its pretty refrain , is exquisitely musical , and others besides this have a pleasant lilt and melody .

		A delicate fancy has woven pretty conceits in their meshes , yet they rarely have the simplicity and spontaneity necessary to an effective appeal to childhood .

		`` The Shadows , '' Wizard Frost , '' '' Clouds , '' The Dewdrop , '' and '' In the Orchard '' are the most charming in the imaginative freshness of their ideas .

		The present edition is decor - ated with drawings by Misses
Maude	PERSON	and
Genevieve Cowles	PERSON	, which greatly enrich it .

		They are both original and artistic , and have a delightful imaginative grace .

		Some of the drawings , like the fine frontispiece , show a rare tenderness .

		The verses in '' Red Apple and Silver Bells '' -LRB- Put - nam -RRB- , by Mr.
Hamish Hendry	PERSON	, are more childish ; they have a more spontaneous naivete .

		Children might have conceived them ; they might almost have written them .

		Yet their conceits are often forced , and sometimes bad grammar is made to take the place of inspiration .

		A bit of genuine truth is dropped down into some of them , as in the verses called `` Friendship '' ; and others , like u White Horses , '' are richly imaginative .

		Many of them have a lyrical swing , and their ideas are of the kind that children like .

		The illustrations , by Miss
Alice B. Wood	PERSON	- ward , are thoroughly charming , as fresh and fanciful as the poems , and more artistic .

		It is odd to have a book of
Eugene Field	ORGANIZATION	's come to us from
England	LOCATION	.

		But the selections for '' Lullaby - Land '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- were made by Mr.
Kenneth Grahame	PERSON	and the pictures by Mr.
Charles Robinson	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Grahame	PERSON	writes also , in his exquisite imaginative way , an appre - ciative preface .

		The illustrations , except in the case of `` Little Boy Blue , '' are also sympathetic .

		They are charm - ing , often decorative , often cleverly pictorial .

		And the diminutive figures which serve as head and tail pieces are delightful .

		The poems themselves are above our approbation .

		They are the real thing , they belong to the great company .

		This poet is one of the few to whom Nonsense-Land is true and visible . ''

		As soon as he set himself to narrate the goings-on there , '' says Mr.
Gra	PERSON	- hame , and no one knows this country better than he , '' those of us who had been tourists in by-gone days , but had lost our return-tickets , pricked up our ears , and listened , and remembered , and knew .

		The Dinkey-Bird , we recollected at once , had been singing the day we left , in the amf alula - tree ; and there , of course , he must have been singing ever since , only we had forgotten the way to listen .

		Eugene Field gently reminded us , and the Dinkey-Bird was vocal once more , to be silent never again . ''

		Perhaps the most alluring of the picture-books , one that will go to the very heart of the children , is '' Mother Goose in Prose '' -LRB-
Way & Williams	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
L. Frank Baum	PERSON	.

		Here they will find the old familiar favorites set forth in new and diverting guise ; here they can f ol - 400 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, low the author in weaving strange fancies into the old rhymes , or the artist in imagining new figures to fit the immortal descriptions .

		The pictures , by Mr.
Maxfield Parrisb	PERSON	, are brilliant in their originality , their fitness , their expressiveness , and their decorative adjustment of lines and masses .

		They are intensely individual , the expression of a peculiar personality ; yet they are adapted with sympathetic art to the subject in hand .

		From a decorative standpoint the most successful drawings are for Little Boy Blue , the
Black Sheep	ORGANIZATION	, Humpty Dumpty , and Tom the
Piper	ORGANIZATION	's Son .

		In these and in some others Mr.
Parrish	PERSON	artfully leads the imagination down wind - ing paths and trailing into fascinating villages and such turretted castles as the fancy yearns to play about .

		In this he shows that he understands children and can fol - low them to the enchanted lands they love .

		Some of the same comprehension is shown by the author , who makes charming stories out of the old lines .

		He is not too definite nor too exact , and he does not prevent the child from spinning his own tales .

		He uses the verses merely as a text for delightful little stories , and he would be a very practical and stony-hearted child indeed who could not enjoy them .

		Several of the picture-books take to poetry this year .

		In '' The Vege-Men 's Revenge '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- the verses are written by Miss
Bertha Upton	PERSON	, and form a non - sensical but rather heavy accompaniment to the pictures by Miss
Florence K. Upton	PERSON	.

		They are printed in color , and give character and varied emotions to a number of our commonest and least sensitive vegetables .

		Potatoes , tomatoes , and carrots take on a new interest and excite a. new sympathy .

		The work is therefore cleverly done . ''

		The Autobiography of a Monkey '' -LRB-
Russell	PERSON	-RRB- tells in fluent verse , by Mr.
Albert Bigelow Paine	PERSON	, the story of a beast who passes from the jungle to the hands of an organ-grinder and through many subsequent adven - tures in the role of a man .

		He returns at last to the jungle to teach his race that '' man did not
spring	DATE	from the monkey , but monkey descended from man ! ''

		The pictures , by Mr.
Hy	PERSON	.


Mayer	PERSON	, are clever and amusing , and combine the characters of monkey and man with grim adroitness For unadulterated fun one must turn to The Bad Child 's Book of Beasts '' -LRB- Arnold -RRB- , with verses by
H. B.	PERSON	and pictures by
B. T. B. Author	PERSON	and artist have happily combined to make a book of de - lightful nonsense .

		One comes upon such unexpected rhymes as this : '' The Whale that wanders round the pole Is not a table fish .

		You can not bake or boil him whole , Nor serve him in a dish . ''

		And the pictures contain as many surprises as the text .

		The amount of character which the artist manages to put into the learned fish , the elephant , and even the callous hippopotamus will please children of all ages .

		The same authors publish '' More Beasts for Worse Children '' -LRB- Arnold -RRB- , but they make it much less quaintly diverting than the smaller book .

		It has its points though , and its surprises .

		A good book of nonsense is as difficult to write as it is delightful to read .

		And Blown Away '' -LRB-
L. C. Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a veritable triumph which Mr.
Richard Mans	PERSON	- field has achieved in a new art .

		It is pure nonsense , absurdly inconsequent nonsense , but it will provoke more laughter than any amount of rhyme or reason .

		The author rattles on , jumping in the most surprising way from one subject to another , and never for a moment losing his hold upon his audience .

		The book is infinite variety , and the variety is infinitely diverting .

		As the author says in his preface , '' it relates no story .

		It has no point , policy , or purpose . ''

		It is merely fun , unadulterated fun , and the man who could read a page of it without laughing would be hardened indeed .

		It is the most delicious thing of the kind that has been printed since '' Alice in
Wonderland	LOCATION	. ''

		The illustrations are also delightful , those by Miss
Margaret Jones	PERSON	being very pretty , and those by the author extremely ludicrous .

		The cover is unfortunately so bad as to be prejudicial to the book 's success . ''

		The Dumpies '' -LRB-
Russell	PERSON	-RRB- were discovered by Mr.
Frank Ver-Beek	PERSON	, and their strange history is now nar - rated by Mr.
Albert Bigelow Paine	PERSON	.

		They are very short and fat , the Dumpies , and
King Dumpling	ORGANIZATION	is the shortest and fattest of them all ; and all the beasts of the field who inhabit their country become like unto them .

		Their history is nonsense , rather prolonged and dry , but their pictures are clever and will captivate the little people who like little things .

		Miss
Alice B. Woodward	PERSON	has illustrated '' Adventures in
Toyland	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , by Miss
Edith King Hall	PERSON	; and the toys become animated and emotional without in the least losing their character as toys .

		The drawings are very ingenious , and the stories told by a marionette are cleverly contrived to show that the lives of these apparently quiet toys are really full of exciting incident The story of '' The Blackberries and their Adventures '' -LRB-
Russell	PERSON	-RRB- is told and pictured by Mr.
E. W. Kemble	PERSON	, who makes his amusing pickaninnies indulge in various sports .

		Miss
S. Rosamond Praeger	PERSON	is both author and illustrator of `` The Adventures of the Three Bold Babes '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- .

		It is an absurd little story , which , with the aid of its absurd big pictures , may amuse very lit - tle people .

		But it is decidedly a book of an hour only .

		Miss
Maud Humphrey	PERSON	's sentimental , over-dressed '' Little Grown-Ups '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- will be popular doubt - less , as this particular doll-like prettiness finds too ready a welcome .

		The decorative borders , by
Miss E. S. Tucker	PERSON	, are better , but the text has as little character as the colored pictures `` A New Baby World '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a collection of stories , rhymes , and pictures for little folks , compiled from the pages of '' St.
Nicholas	PERSON	'' by Mrs.
Mary Mapes Dodge	PERSON	.

		They are of all kinds , from gay to pathetic , and any child 's mood might be satisfied here .

		The cover is charming in color . ''

		Little Hearts '' -LRB-
Routledge	PERSON	-RRB- appeals to the same au - dience .

		The verses , by Miss
Bertha Upton	PERSON	, are rather insipid , but the pictures , by Miss
Florence K. Upton	PERSON	, have a good deal of character . ''

		Chatterbox '' -LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- makes its annual appearance , but both pictures and text are pretty far behind the times .

		The same thing might be said of ''
Sunday	DATE	Reading for the Young '' -LRB- Young -RRB- , though some of the pictures here are much better .

		Two nature books are in the children 's list .

		And the stories in '' Among the Meadow People '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mrs.
Clara Dillingham Pierson	PERSON	, are as fascinating as fairy-tales .

		They are fairy-tales , in fact , for the insects talk to the flowers of the field and the flowers graciously reply .

		They are prettily told , with the de - sign of fixing the habits of these little creatures in the child 's memory ; and to that end the writer gives them life and individuality .

		The drawings , by Mr.
F. C. Gordon	PERSON	, help to make this one of the most useful and delightful books of the year .

		`` The Plant Baby and its Friends '' -LRB- Silver ,
Burdett , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mrs.
Kate Louise Brown	PERSON	, is iu the form of a reader for small children .

		It aims to teach the first principles of botany

		THE DIAL 401 in a gay and attractive story-telling manner .

		But the dialogue is often forced and the stories are not imag - inative enough .

		The illustrations are good .

		Fortunately for the girls of the present generation , they do not confine themselves to the books ostensibly written for them , for if they did we might rear a weak and flabby set of women .

		Of the least of the boys ' books a certain vigor is required , which raises them above inanity .

		And it is much easier to endure their defects than the species of snobbishness and sentiment - ality so familiar in the books for girls .

		There are only a few which escape these snags ; there are only a few , in fact , which try to escape them .

		But , happily , the girl of the present day is fast growing away from such reading ; her out-of-door games make her too healthy in body and mind to care for trash . ''

		Three Margarets '' -LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mrs.
Laura E. Richards	PERSON	, is conceived on a new plan .

		The Margarets are three cousins of the same name , one from the
East	LOCATION	, ne from a ranch in the West , and one from a Cuban plantation , who come together for a
summer	DATE	's visit to an uncle whom they have never seen .

		There is here an opportunity for contrast in character , which Mrs.
Richards	PERSON	skilfully , but somewhat melodramatically , im - proves .

		It is on the whole a charming little story , with a good deal of human nature in it ; but it has not the beauty which the author herself achieved in '' Cap - tain
January	DATE	. ''

		The pictures , by Miss
Ethelred B. Barry	PERSON	, are pretty , though a trifle insipid , and the cover is clever .

		Two books by Miss
Ellen Douglas	PERSON
Deland	LOCATION	appear in the holiday list .

		In spite of its masculine title , ''
Alan Ransford	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- is distinctly of the type called feminine .

		It has more cleverness and virility than most of the books of its kind , but a love-story with an excess of sentiment in it is not the most healthful read - ing for growing girls .

		For that kind of thing , however , it is exceptionally well done '' A Successful Venture '' -LRB-
W. A. Wilde & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is more sane , but this also is marred by premature and ill-timed love-makings .

		It is the story of a family of girls , who , to avoid living with an aunt they do not like , start in to make their own way in the world .

		They succeed in spite of dis - appointments , and have a good deal of pleasure in the process .

		Miss
Deland	LOCATION	's style is good , and her dialogue is generally free and natural .

		The pictures , by Mrs.
Alice Barber Stephens	PERSON	, are excellent .

		The '' Ten Little Comedies '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Miss
Gertrude Smith	PERSON	, author of the '' Arabella and Aramiuta Stories , '' are not written in the form of come - dies .

		They are described as '' tales of the troubles of ten little girls whose tears were turned into smiles '' ; and they are pretty , healthful , graceful little stories of the sorrows and joys which are so important in the lives of children .

		There is no eccentricity in them , but they have some character and a good deal of human nature .

		The moral tone is excellent , though the lessons are not all one way , and the author 's heart is obviously with the children .

		The plots have originality , and they are handled with a kind of delicate tact .

		There is moral enough and to spare in the story of '' Miss
Nina Barrow	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Miss
Frances Conrtenay Baylor	PERSON	.

		The girl who is its centre and cir - cumference is a disagreeable , spoiled , self-willed child , who is supposed to be entirely changed by the influence of a thoughtful cousin and contact with a well-regulated English family where the children are not tyrants .

		The reform is a rather tedious one , and a little difficult to believe in .

		And the moral lectures and good examples are too obvious and extended to be interesting to the normal girl . ''


Marion Harland	PERSON	'' has written an attractive and human story of the life of a girl fifty years ago , when the schoolmaster had the power to be a master indeed .

		As set forth in '' An Old-Field School-Girl '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , Flea 's experience with such an instructor is a particularly unhappy one .

		But it is told vigorously and sympatheti - cally , and without sentimentality .

		The girl is very much alive , and she has intelligence and spirit , qualities in which the characters in girls ' books are too often conspicuously lacking .

		There is a charm , too , about the
Virginia	LOCATION	life of the middle-century , and the pictures , partly from photographs , help to make it vivid .

		Miss
Amanda M. Douglas	PERSON	has been industrious enough to write three girls ' books this season .

		The first of them , '' The Children at
Sherburne House	ORGANIZATION	'' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- , continues the series familiar to her readers .

		The story is very mature , and ends , in the approved fashion , with wedding-bells .

		The girl who is old enough to read it is old enough to read something much better Upon '' Her Place in the World '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , it is neces - sary to make the same comment , for the sort of love - making it contains is not particularly edifying '' Han - nah Ann '' -LRB-
Dodd	PERSON	-RRB- is a sequel to '' A Little Girl in Old
New York	LOCATION	'' and begins in
1846	DATE	.

		Its subject therefore has an interest of its own in the contrast in manners and customs .

		Miss
Douglas	PERSON	's style is flexible , and her stories are sweet and unaffected .

		In reading '' Miss Mouse and her Boys '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , one can understand the perennial charm which Mrs.
Molesworth	PERSON	has for the young , and rejoice that it is a wholesome one .

		Her gentleness , her sympathy , her real knowledge of child-life , are all in evidence , and there is quiet forcefulness in the book which is pleasant to encounter .

		The illustrations , by
Miss L. Leslie Brooke	PERSON	, are clever .

		The charm is much less evident in this author 's book for older girls , '' Meg Langholme '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Here the style grows stilted and takes on the faults which young women are supposed to ad - mire .

		Still , there is heartiness in the descriptions , and a certain vigor in the exciting but unnatural situations .

		Miss Yonge 's girls ' book for the season is called '' Founded on Paper '' -LRB-
Thomas Whittaker	PERSON	-RRB- , and begins with one of Queen
Victoria	PERSON	's jubilees , and ends with the other .

		It contains a little excitement and a good deal of preaching , which would be more effective if it were more condensed .

		It is a rather goody-goody little book , but
Miss Yonge	LOCATION	's admirers know what to expect .

		Mrs.
Champney	PERSON	's '' Witch Winnie in
Venice	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- is quite different from her charming story of ''
Pierre	PERSON	and his Poodle . ''

		It is too instructive to be artistic , but it contains a large amount of information put up in sugar .

		Mrs.
Champney	PERSON	writes briskly and well , and she mixes history and biography and romance in a bright and effective way .

		Many photographs illustrate the book .

		Miss
Evelyn Raymond	PERSON	presents a study of country schools and country boys and girls in '' The Little Red Schoolhouse '' -LRB-
Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- .

		She has done it cleverly , too , and has given an interesting picture of school-boy pranks and failures and successes .

		And there is a touch of school-boy devotion and self-sacrifice and heroism .

		The points are occasionally strained , but they have some human nature in them , nevertheless .

		The pictures are wooden .

		It is hardly possible to do much more than enumerate the remaining girls ' books upon our table . ''

		Sue Orcutt '' 402 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, cutt '' -LRB-
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mrs.
Charlotte M. Vaile	PERSON	, is a sequel to '' The Orcutt Girls . ''

		It carries Sue on through the training she had so ardently desired , and shows how , after the academy was left behind , she worked her way through college . ''

		Queer Janet '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has for its heroine a girl who has the commoner fault -LRB- in books -RRB- of being too good .

		Miss Grace Le
Baron	PERSON	is the author '' Rich Enough '' -LRB-
Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- , by Miss
Leigh Webster	PERSON	, is a story for older girls .

		Its theme is found in the removal to the country of a family which is too poor to maintain its social position in town .

		The change proves fortunate , and everything winds up in happiness .

		In '' Wanolasset , The Little-One - Who-Laughs '' -LRB-
Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- ,
Miss A. G. Plympton	PERSON	goes back to Puritan days .

		The story has a sweet and gentle flavor ; it is prettily written , and prettily illustrated by the author .

		`` A Girl 's Ordeal '' -LRB-
Coates	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mrs.
Lucy C. Lillie	PERSON	, is of the nature of a novel , and much too sensational for either young or old The '' Hearthstone Series '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- contains a story by Miss Sophie May called '' The Campion Diamonds , '' and one by
Ellen H. Cooley	PERSON	called '' The Boom of a
Western City	LOCATION	. ''

Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- . ''

		Three Pretty Maids '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , by Miss
Amy E. Blanchard	PERSON	, contains some good illustrations by
Alice Barber Stephens	PERSON	. ''

		A Lonely Little Lady '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- , by Miss

		But in addition it is enriched too much with fine feathers and love-making to be wholesome Miss
E. Everett-Green	ORGANIZATION	makes a contribution to girls ' literature in '' Sister '' -LRB-

		This too is rather sentimental for young readers , and rather old and complicated A pretty , graceful tale , with a bit of the negro element in it , is `` Little Homespun '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , by
Ruth Ogden	PERSON	-LRB- Mrs.
Charles W. Ide	PERSON	-RRB- .

		It is a sequel to `` Courage , '' which has already achieved some popularity . ''

		A Dear Little Girl '' -LRB-
Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- , written and illustrated by Miss
Amy E. Blanchard	PERSON	, is a pleasant little story for pleasant little girls .

		We hail it as a healthy sign that so many popular books on outdoor subjects are now appearing .

		Certainly one of the best of these is `` Wild Neighbors '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by the well-known writer ,
Ernest Ingersoll	PERSON	.

		This book consists of very pleasantly written sketches of such common American mammals as the woodchuck , porcu - pine , raccoon , gray squirrel , and skunk , and also chap - ters on the puma , the coyote , the badger , and on animal intelligence .

		The homelier the theme , the happier seems to be the author 's vein ; and the masterpiece of the vol - ume is the chapter entitled '' The Skunk Calmly Con - sidered , '' which is an extremely pleasant and interesting account of that mephitic being .

		While his work is mainly a skilful compilation from such writers as
Thoreau	LOCATION	,
Burroughs	LOCATION	,
Abbott	PERSON	, and others , Mr.
Ingersoll	PERSON	yet records many of his own observations and conclusions .

		Some of these latter the reader may well question , as that the gray squirrel smells nuts hidden under several feet of snow .

		The illustrations in this book are not well selected nor of a high order of merit .

		The numerous pictures of bones have little meaning in a work of this kind .

		But the volume as a whole is a capital one for boys , and for all of larger growth who have or should have a real interest in animals .

		Several historical books must be added to the long list given in our last number .

		Miss
Beatrice Harraden	PERSON	contributes one called '' Untold Tales of the Past '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- .

		They are slight , forgotten episodes which she describes and elaborates .

		She does it prettily but with a certain air of condescension , writing down unnecessa - rily to the children 's level .

		Joan of Arc ,
Caxton	ORGANIZATION	,
Csesar	PERSON	, and Phidias are some of the heroes who form the centres of these stories , which show them always iu contact with the young .

		There is a tendency to sentimentality in the author 's method .

		The drawings by Mr.
H. R. Millar	PERSON	are variable , but some of them are excellent .

		`` The King 's Story Book '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- is constructed after an entirely new pattern by Mr.
George Laurence Gomme	PERSON	.

		It contains a series of historical studies deal - ing with English kings from the Conquest to the reign of
William IV.	LOCATION	; but these are extracted entirely from romantic literature .

		Shakespeare furnishes the accounts of
John	ORGANIZATION	,
Henry IV.	PERSON	, Prince
Hal	PERSON	, and
Edward V.	PERSON	; Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	those of
Henry II.	PERSON	,
Richard	PERSON	of the
Lion Heart	ORGANIZATION	,
Edward I.	PERSON	,
James I.	PERSON	,
Charles I.	PERSON	, and the Com - monwealth ;
Thackeray	PERSON	supplies those of
Anne	PERSON	and
George IV.	PERSON	;
Dickens	PERSON	that of
George III.	PERSON	; and
Lord Lytton	LOCATION	,
Charlotte	LOCATION	Bront ^ , and
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	are among the others drawn upon .

		It will readily be seen that the book is readable for young and old .

		The drawings by
Harrison Miller	PERSON	are only tolerable .

		The title of '' An Emperor 's Doom '' -LRB-
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Herbert Hayens	PERSON	, refers to
Maximilian	PERSON	of
Mexico	LOCATION	.

		His is a tragic story , but well worth the telling , and the book gives one some idea of the mistakes that were made and the pitif ulness of it all .

		The author 's style is good , and the story moves swiftly and excitedly .

		The cover and illustra - tions are excellent .

		The same author is responsible for '' Soldiers of the Legion '' -LRB-
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		This too is a story of conspiracy and war , but the scene is changed to
Spain	LOCATION	, and the Carlists are the principal actors .

		There is a briskness about Mr.
Hayens	PERSON	's style which will appeal to boys Mrs.
E. Everett-Green	PERSON	writes of '' A Clerk of Oxford '' -LRB-
Nelson	PERSON	-RRB- and tells of his adventures in the Barons ' War .

		The archaic English of the dialogue is rather forced , and the style throughout the book a little heavy , so that the long and complicated story is not carried off with spirit .

		America is treated bountifully this year , as several additional books will testify . ''

		The Exploits of Myles Standish '' -LRB-
Appleton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- are narrated by Mr.
Henry Johnson	PERSON	-LRB-
Muirhead Robertson	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		His material for the first thirty-six years is avowedly imaginary , but after the Mayflower set sail the story is based upon the records .

		It is vigorously told , but the author can not make his characters live .

		And the description of the famous Staudish courtship is stiff and unconvincing .

		The same period , picturesque in contrasts , in character and cour - age , is treated in '' On
Plymouth	LOCATION	Rock '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Samuel Adams Drake	PERSON	.

		His is a sim - ple , straightforward account , written primarily for schools , of the manners and customs of the early Puri - tans .

		The style is good and the little book is interest - ing and valuable .

		The Revolution , however , is still in the lead , for the most charming of these books is '' An Unwilling Maid '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , in which Miss
Jeanie Gould Lincoln	PERSON	tells a graceful story in a graceful way .

		There is something refreshingly attractive about the book , and the characters have individuality and charm .

		Betty is human and alive , and her little sister Moppet is a true child and delightful Dr.
Everett T. Tomlinson	PERSON	contributes another book to the story of
1812	DATE	.

		The scene of action in `` Guarding the Border '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is largely the Great Lakes , and the author gives an idea of the task of building a navy and learn -
1897	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 403 ing to make it effective .

		General
Scott	PERSON	makes an ap - pearance in this book .

		Mr.
James Barnes	PERSON	also makes another contribution to the history of this war in '' Yan - kee Ships and Yankee Sailors '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Mr.
Barnes	PERSON	's style is admirable , and the stories he has taken from history and tradition are stirring narratives of valiant deeds .

		Many of them are of the kind which the new navy and the new system of warfare have made impossible , and it is well to preserve thus the memory of them to our boys and girls .

		The illustrations by
Zogbaum	PERSON	and
Chapman	PERSON	are excellent .

		Mrs.
Molly Elliot Seawell	PERSON	also deals with the water in '' Twelve Naval Captains '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		Her style is more care - less than were her investigations , for she gives accurate and interesting biographies of the most important of our early commanders .

		The book is illustrated with repro - ductions of old portraits .

		In taking up '' The Vanished Yacht '' -LRB- Nelson -RRB- , one leaves the region of history , but remains with the sea .

		* Mr.
E. Harcourt Burrage	PERSON	has written a spirited and exciting tale with a most unusual plot , and he makes the extraordinary incidents seem real .

		Its theme is the chase of a yacht stolen by a Spanish adventurer , and its capture after many difficulties are surmounted .

		The illustrations are good , and the style of the narrative is well calculated to sustain interest '' The Island of Gold '' -LRB- Nelson -RRB- is another '' sailor 's yarn , '' written this time by Dr.
Gordon Stables	PERSON	of the
Royal Navy	ORGANIZATION	.

		It des - cribes many dangers , but always some miraculous release from them .

		The improbabilities are rather too numer - ous even for a boy 's insatiable appetite , and the men and women who figure in them have no independent life .

		A few good illustrations are by
Allan Stewart	PERSON	.

		Mr.
S. R. Crockett	PERSON	appears as the narrator of '' The Surpris - ing Adventures of Sir Toady Lion '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , and de - scribes it as '' an improving history for old boys , young boys , good boys , bad boys , big boys , little boys , cow-boys , and torn-boys . ''

		The story is charming , thoroughly fresh and childish and natural , and enlivened with a whimsical , delightful humor .

		There is a bit of sentiment in it , but it is not unwholesome sentiment .

		Mr.
Gordon Browne	PERSON	's pictures are a fit accompaniment , for they have character , too . ''

		The Enchanted Burro '' -LRB- Way &
Williams	PERSON	-RRB- and '' The King of the Broncos '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , both by Mr.
Charles F. Lummis	PERSON	, are not ex - clusively books for boys , yet they will derive much instruc - tion and entertainment from them .

		They contain stories of
New Mexico	LOCATION	and
South America	LOCATION	, countries too little known to our youth , written by a man who is familiar with every foot of the ground .

		His style , too , pictur - esquely suits his subject , and reveals some of the charm of the Spanish and Indian mixture of races .

		There are rather too many Spanish phrases , with superfluous expla - nations of them in the notes , but it is not these which gives us the spirit of this strange civilization .

		In the first-mentioned book the pictures by
Charles Abel Corwin	PERSON	are capital , and the very original cover suggests the mystery of the Southwestern plains .

		It should be possible to satisfy the most exacting child from this long list , for though the struggle for novelty is often too evident and many fall by the way - side , some of these writers understand their world and can adjust the desirable to the acceptable .

		Their books will last longer than the season , for children are quick to know their friends ; but one wonders where the bad books go to , whether there is a special heaven and hell for the hundreds of volumes that die before the year is out .

		LITERARY NOTES .

		Mr.
W. R. Jenkins	PERSON	has just published '' A Brief Italian Grammar with Exercises , '' the work of Dr.
Hjalmar Edgren	PERSON	, favorably known as the author of elementary French and Spanish grammars .

		The tenth annual meeting of the
American Economic Association	ORGANIZATION	will be held
December 29-31	DATE	, at
Cleveland	LOCATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	.

		Professors
F. H. Giddings	PERSON	,
Carroll D. Wright	PERSON	,
Arthur T. Hadley	PERSON	,
Richmond Mayo-Smith	PERSON	,
F. W. Taus	PERSON	- sig , and
J. L. Laughlin	PERSON	, and Secretary
Gage	PERSON	are among the speakers announced .

		Mrs.
Alice Wellington Rollins	PERSON	, a member of the little colony of artists and literary folk who live in
Lawrence Park	LOCATION	,
Bronxville	LOCATION	, a few miles out of
New York	LOCATION	, died on the fifth of this month .

		She was born in
Boston	LOCATION	about fifty years ago , and was well known as a writer of poetry , criticism , and sketches of travel .

		We have received the first numbers of '' L'Echo de la Semaine , '' a weekly '' revue litte ` raire et mondaine '' published in
Boston	LOCATION	.

		It is an eight-page sheet , agree - ably diversified in contents , and promises , among other things , to reprint
M. Brunetiere	PERSON	's impressions of
America	LOCATION	au fur et a mesure qu'elles paralront , The Central Division of the Modern Language Asso - ciation of
America	LOCATION	will hold its third annual meeting at the
Northwestern University	ORGANIZATION	,
Evanston	LOCATION	,
Illinois	LOCATION	, the
last two days of this year	DATE	and the first of the next .

		Papers are announced by many well-known philologists , among them being Professors
D. K. Dodge	PERSON	,
Julius Goebel	PERSON	,
C. F. McClumpha	PERSON	,
J. E. Matzke	PERSON	,
Georg Hempl	PERSON	,
J. T. Hatfield	PERSON	, and
Ewald Fluegel	PERSON	.

		Messrs.
Scott	PERSON	,
Foresman & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers of '' Principles of Vocal Expression , '' by Messrs.
W. B. Chamberlain	PERSON	and
S. H. Clark	PERSON	.

		It is a practical treatise , the outcome of classroom work , upon '' the rhetoric of vocal expression '' and '' mental technique and literary interpretation . ''

		The same publishers send us Dr.
W. L. Burdick	PERSON	's ''
Topical Outlines of Roman History	ORGANIZATION	, '' a small book for preparatory students .

		A proposition to levy tribute upon authors and pub - lishers for the benefit of libraries wouliseem too absurd to be treated seriously , and yet we are advised that a bill for this purpose is actually to be introduced into the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	of the
United States	LOCATION	, the doubtful honor falling to Senator
Perkins	PERSON	of
California	LOCATION	, in which State the movement appears to have originated .

		By this bill , four copies of '' the best edition '' of every copyright book published in the
United States	LOCATION	-LRB- in addition to the two copies required to be sent to the Librarian of Con - gress -RRB- are to be distributed among certain libraries designated , at
San Francisco	LOCATION	,
Denver	LOCATION	,
Chicago	LOCATION	, and
New Orleans	LOCATION	.

		Publishers of '' every subsequent edition '' having '' any substantial changes '' are to be similarly mulcted .

		It is urged , by the
Committee of California Librarians	ORGANIZATION	having the plan in charge , that '' there is a widespread feeling that copies of copyrighted works should be available , so far as possible , for general reference , '' and that this applies especially to residents of the
Pacific Coast	LOCATION	.

		But why not buy the books that are so much to be desired ?

		Or , if they can be got without buying , simply by Act of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, why limit the number of involuntary donations to four copies ?

		Why not make it fourteen , or forty , copies , and thus extend the benefits of the act to other deserving regions where there is a widespread feeling that books '' should be available for general reference '' ?

		THE DIAL 409 A HINT FOR THE HOLIDAYS .

		FOR THE PRESENT HOLIDAY SEASON , Book lovers have the chance to procure for gift purposes such a literary treasure as was never before seen .

		To Mr.
Charles Dudley Warner	PERSON	, as its editor-in-chief , belongs the palm of victory for this achievement in book production .

		The '' Library of the World 's Best Literature , '' as it has been happily named , might also fitly be termed the world 's crowning effort in the creation of books .

		Either praise or minute description of this magnificent work would seem almost needless to a public that has read its eulogy , since the appearance of the very first volume , in all the chief literary periodicals of the country .

		Just here may be noted briefly the principal features that constitute the Library a work of surpassing excellence for profit and enjoyment : CRITICAL ESSAYS .

		About a thousand graphic essays , by living scholars and writers of eminence , furnish in popular style their critical , interpretative , biographical , and historical comments on the world 's great authors and their principal works , alike of ancient and modern times .

		In every one of these the critic is also a specialist in relation to his subject .

		SELECTED LITERATURE .

		Following the interpretative studies are presented the master productions of the most famous writers of all ages and countries .

		The collection includes Poetry , History , Romance , Oratory , Biography , Science and Philosophy , Theology , Letters , Drama , Wit and Humor , and every other form of literary expression .

		HISTORY OF LITERATURE .

		The Library contains histories of all the world 's literatures , ancient and modern , written in each case by a specialist who is recognized as author - ity on the subject .

		The sacred books of the nations also form special studies .

		SYNOPSIS OF BEST BOOKS .

		Three thousand of the world 's best books are separately analyzed and given in clear synopsis of narrative , plot , and characters .

		Refreshes our past reading and guides to that of the future .

		BIOGRAPHICAL DICTIONARY .

		The most complete and accurate dictionary of the lives of great authors ever made .

		It embraces 12,000 names and gives under each all essential facts and literary successes .

		INDEX .

		The most elaborate and careful ever yet compiled for a work of magnitude .

		It indexes by reference and cross-reference every name , event , book , selection , topic and senti - ment treated of on any page of the Library .

		An immense boon to literary workers .

		Such are the chief features that distinguish the `` Library of the World 's Best Literature . ''

		But they are not all .

		There are others that serve to make it as helpful to the student and scholar as it is bright and entertaining for mere intellectual recreation .

		Not for those of next year or the years to follow , can the LIBRARY be obtained at the excep - tionally low price now made available through the
Harper	PERSON	's
Weekly Club	ORGANIZATION	.

		This was only established as an introductory figure to enable the public to learn the merits and value of the work .

		THE PRICE is TO BE ADVANCED AFTER NEW YEAR 'S DAY .

December	DATE	to all who become members of the
