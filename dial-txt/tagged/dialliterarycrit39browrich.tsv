Prince Kropotlcin	PERSON	has given to the world a record of literary events - ^ which not only tells of what has been written in
Russia	LOCATION	, but what has become of the writers .

		He discloses with forceful fidelity the rank injustices to which Russian men of letters have been subjected for centuries past , and the history of Russian literature is told in terms of exile and imprisonment and persecution and death .

		Writers of great prominence have been sent to
Siberia	LOCATION	, exiled to remote regions , burned at the stake , hanged , imprisoned , excommunicated -- in fact , Russian writers have other questions than those of attic and poverty , royalties and copyright , to trouble them . ''

		There are larger and more electric works on Russian literature , but none , perhaps , which so clearly and unmistakably denote the peculiar quality of Russian literary genius and temperament as does this brilliant study . ''

		^ ... 20 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 21 LIFE IN EPITOME .

		The relation of literature to life has been a subject of curious and inconclusive discus - sion in many times and lands .

		The Latin proverb said that vita sine Uteris mors est , thus emphasizing the grace bestowed by letters upon the bareness of normal existence .

		Turn the saving about and it has a more literal cogency ; for literature without life is in very truth the type of all death , physical , intellect - ual , and moral .

		But the exact nature of the connection between life and literature has always set the pundits at odds , from
Aristotle	LOCATION	to
Arnold	LOCATION	.

		The katharsis doctrine of the Greek sage seems widely at variance with the criticism-of-life theory expounded by the Eng - lish apostle of sweetness and light , although the philosophical mind may , perhaps , discern in some such common term as * interpretation ' or ' reproduction ' a possible synthesis of the opinions which , respectively , hold literature to be an influence acting upon life through the sympathetic emotions and a collection of embod - ied judgments upon human conduct .

		With these weighty and fundamental matters , how - ever , it is not our present purpose to deal , but merely to speak of the single aspect of the sub - ject which may be called the epitomizing quality of literature -- its power to present , with pith and penetration , some human situation , or attitude , or problem , and to present it so typi - cally that it may serve as a finger-post for tiie future no less than as a commentary upon the past .

		Our meaning may be illustrated by a refer - ence to one of the critical periods of American history .

		When , at the close of
1860	DATE	, just after the election of
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	, President
Buchanan	PERSON	sent his last message to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, he had to confront the great question of the impending secession .

		The substance of the message was to the effect that the
Southern States	LOCATION	ought not to withdraw from the
Union	LOCATION	, but if they should be so ill-advised , there was nothing for it but to let them go , and wash our hands of the whole proceeding .

		We do not know that anyone at the time pointed out the Shakespearean parallel to the case , but we have only to open our * Much Ado About N'othing ' to discover how perfect it was .

		Dogberry .

		This is your charge ; you shall appre - hend all vagrom men ; you are to bid any man stan ^ in the prince 's name .

		Watchman .

		How , if he will not stand ?

		Dogberry .

		Why then , take no note of him , but let him go ; and presently call the rest of the watch together , and thank God you are rid of a knave .

		THE DIAI .

		-LSB-
July 1	DATE	, Verges .

		If he will not stand when he is bidden , he is none of the prince 's subjects .

		Dogberry .

		True , and they are to meddle with none but the prince 's subjects .

		When was ever a historical sifuation more typically prefigured by a poet ?

		Eeeent French history , as illustrated by the affaire
Dreyfus	ORGANIZATION	, may afford us another striking example .

		We all remember about the famous bordereau , and about the kind of evidence by which its authorship was sought to be proved .

		Now this situation was anticipated in truly marvellous fashion when '
Lewis Carroll	PERSON	' described the trial of the Knave of Hearts .

		`` There 's more evidence to come yet , please your Majesty , '' said the White Eabbit , jumping up in a great hurry : `` this paper has just been picked up . ''

		`` What 's in it ? ''

		said the Queen .

		`` I have n't opened it yet , '' said the White
Rab	PERSON	- bit , `` but it seems to be a letter , written by the prisoner to -- to somebody . ''

		`` It must have been that , '' said the
King	PERSON	, `` un - less it was written to nobody , which is n't usual you know . ''

		`` Who is it directed to ? ''

		said one of the jury - men .

		`` It is n't directed at all , '' said the
White Eab	ORGANIZATION	- bit , `` in fact , there 's nothing written on the out - side . ''

		He unfolded the paper as he spoke , and added : `` It is n't a letter , after all : it 's a set of verses . ' '

		`` Are they in the prisoner 's handwriting ? ''

		asked another of the jurymen .

		`` No , they 're not , '' said the White Eabbit , `` and that 's the queerest thing about it . ''

		-LRB- The jury all looked puzzled . -RRB-

		`` He must have imitated somebody else 's hand , '' said the
King	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- The jury all brightened up again . -RRB-

		`` Please , your Majesty , '' said the Knave , `` I did n't write it , and they ca n't prove that I did : there 's no name signed at the end . ''

		`` If you did n't sign it , '' said the
King	PERSON	, `` that only makes the matter worse .

		You must have meant some mischief , or else you 'd have signed your name like an honest man . ''

		There was a general clapping of hands at this ; it was the first really clever thing the
King	ORGANIZATION	had said that day .

		`` That proves his guilt , of course , '' said the Queen .

		Beading the account of this episode , again we ask : When was an actual human problem ever more exactly foreseen , and when was ever the bias with which men approach a matter which engages their passions rather than their reasoning powers more delightfully satir - ized ?

		Far apart as * Much Ado About ISToth - ing ' and * Alice in
Wonderland	LOCATION	' stand in the scale of literary values , they at least have in common the epitomizing quality to which we are now calling attention .

		There are many people * young people in par - ticular , who with the best will in the world can not understand why it is that men make such a fuss about literature , and who are hon - estly puzzled by the praises bestowed upon the great literary artists .

		They would like to join in sympathetic appreciation of the masters , and they have an abundant store of gratitude and reverence to lavish upon objects that approve themselves as worthy ; but just what there is in
Shakespeare	LOCATION	and
Wordsworth	PERSON	and
Tennyson	LOCATION	to call for sudi seeming extravagance of eulogy remains a dark mystery .

		Such people are apt , in their moments of revolt , to set it all down to a sort of critical conspiracy , and to consider those who voice the conventional literary esti - mates as chargeable with an irritating kind of hypocrisy .

		They can not see for the life of them why the books of the hour , with their timeliness , their cleverness , their sentimental or sensational interest , should be held of no serious account by the real lovers of literature , while the dull babblers of a bygone age are exalted to the skies by these same devotees of the art of letters .

		Time alone can work the cure of this dis - order , for time brings experience , and the more experience men get , the nearer they approach in their sympathies to the great writers , whose greatness is based in large measure upon the richness of the experience that has come to them with their ripened years .

		Some young people never recover from the condition of open revolt into which they are thrown by the injudicious methods of our education .

		Literature is forced upon them before they are susceptible to its appeal , and remains ever afterward associated in their minds with the disagreeable tasks of the school room .

		Others gradually work them - selves into a sort of pretended acceptance of the orthodox view , and do lip-service to the ideals of literary art which are stamped as worthy by the voice of authority .

		Still others assume an attitude of proper humility in the presence of the great writers , admit that there must be more in them than is presently apparent , and honestly endeavor to grow into sympathy with them .

		These , and these alone of the three classes , have their reward in an ever-broadening under - standing and appreciation of the meaning of the masterpiece , of the significance of its essen - tial message to the soul of man .

		Yet even these , unless they are exceptionally
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAIi endowed with sensitiveness to the artistic impression , may never penetrate into the arena of the aesthetic mystery .

		They may never come to know , as an intimate ecstasy rather than as a lesson learned by rote , why it is , for example , that `
Kubla Khan	PERSON	' is a shade more wonderful than anj-thing else in
Coleridge	LOCATION	, why it is that Hamlet 's ' Absent thee from felicity awhile , ' has a beauty so supreme that it is the crowning verse of the entire tragedy .

		But they may come to know , very sympathetically and completely , the significance of those phrases in ' Hamlet ' or elsewhere , which contain the ulti - mate distillation of a rich experience , and to enter into this kind of communion with a great poet is no mean privilege .

		It is , we are inclined to think , the largest reward that liter - ature offers to the faithful many , although a further and finer reward awaits the few whose senses are rightly attuned for its reception .

		This power of exhibiting life in epitome , of providin ^ r the typical form of expression for its every relation , of recasting common experi - ence to heightened and purified effect -- this is the power which makes literature mean so much to mankind , and gives it for each individual a meaning in proportion to the variety and depth of the experiences that have made up his own life .


Frederic Myers	PERSON	speaks , in a beautiful passage , of * the mass of emotion which has slowly gathered round certain lines of
Virgil	PERSON	's as it has round certain texts of the
Bible	LOCATION	, till they come to us charged with more than an indi - vidual passion and with a meaning wider than their own -- with the cry of the despair of all generations , with the yearning of all loves unappeased , with the anguish of all partings , '' beneath the pressure of separate eternities . '' '

		And this , in some degree , is what must be said of aU the great poets , and it is the secret of their enduring influence .

		When a work of liter - ature has had time to acquire associations of this description , and has proved itself worthy of the accretion , its immortality is assured .

		The fashion of the world changes , the material works of man crumble away , and social arrangements feel the touch of mortality ; but the human soul amid all these transformations of environing conditions , remains responsive to the same appeal as of old . '

		Pallas is not , Phoebus breathes no more In breathing brass or gold : Clytaemnestra towers ,
Cassandra	PERSON	wails , for ever : Time is bold .

		But nor heart nor hand hath he to unwrite the scriptures writ of old .

		Dead the great chryselephantine God , as dew
last evening	TIME	shed : Dust of earth or foam of ocean is the symbol of his head : Earth and ocean shall be shadows when Prometheus shall be dead . '

		THE PROBLEM OF CRITICISM .

		There is a story of a carpenter 's apprentice who ran through the streets with his arms extended , crying out , ' Do n't get in my way !

		Do n't get in my way !

		I am carrying the meas - ure of a door . '

		The critic who is honest in his trade will hardly claim that his methods are much more exact than this .

		There is no metric system that can take the precise height and breadth and depth of works of genius .

		And literature and music , at least , dwell in regions of the fourth dimension and are floated still farther out of reach of measurement and com - parison .

		What is literature ?

		Why do we read bools ?

		The answers to the first question are as various as the minds that have essayed the riddle .

		To Aristotle , literature was an imitation of life .

		To Plato , it was an imitation of an imitation , a copy of that which itself is only a blurred reflection of the Divine Ideas .

		To
Schiller	PERSON	, literature was the play impulse of mankind , man 's spirit freeing itself in the ideal .

		To
Eus	ORGANIZATION	- kin , literature was man 's hymn of praise to
Grod	LOCATION	.

		To
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, it was a criticism of life .

		The trouble with all such explanations is that they do not explain .

		They are partial and inadequate .

		They do not cover the whole ground .

		We have to frame a definition of litera - ture which will bridge the gulf between the Iliad and ' The Banquet of Trimalchio , ' between ` King
Lear	PERSON	' and `
Willie	PERSON	brew 'd a peck o ' maut ' ; between the philosophy of
Kant	PERSON	and the latest detective story .

		And we have to take into ac - count that the mortal puts on immortality when transformed by art .

		Literature may be a shadow , an imitation , a criticism of life .

		It may be a reflection in a mirror , but its images detach themselves from the glass ; they walk out into the world with an existence no less assured and certainly more lasting than the creatures of nfe , and they dominate the world for good or evil .

		Perhaps in the answer to onr second question we may find some solution of the first .

		Here , too .

		there are many guesses , but critical opinion may be said to arrange itself into two opposing camps .

		One clan of critics claim that iiie pur - pose of literature is pleasure .

		It awakens , they say , agreeable images and impulses in our minds , and its essence therefore is beauty .

		To the other army the end of literature is moral 8 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, good .

		It tends , they say , to instruct , discipline , and exalt mankind .

		Tiie first of these explanations is plainly inadmissible in regard to many of the mightiest works of literature .

		These tire or shock or appall the average mind .

		The average mind makes indeed no effort to grapple with them , and if they are written to please they miss their object as far as the generality of readers is concerned .

		Only the most athletic students can cope with them .

		Undoubtedly when they are finally mastered by these , they give a glow of conquest and achievement , a sense of revelation .

		But this recompense deserves a higher name than pleasure .

		When the athlete , after months of laborious training , runs his race and falls fainting at the goal , his sense of triumph U something different from pleasure .

		When the Catholic penitent flagellates his bare back with a knotted whip , his sense of sin rebuked , of flesh mortified , is something other than pleasure .

		When the Indian sings his death song at the stake while the fire is licking at his limbs , his stern sense of joy is hardly pleasure in any ordi - nary meaning of the term .

		While we have such ideas as duty , honor , devotion , religious emo - tion , to explain the incitements of men to diffi - cult or heroic deeds , there is certainly no need to subsume all these under the inferior con - ception of pleasure .

		And all these feelings and many others help us on in our dealings with literature .

		The case is similar in regard to beauty , which many writers on SBsthetic deem the central or sole object of literature .

		We have the ideas of the grand , the sublime , the pathetic , the terrible , the grotesque , the imperfect , all of which enter into the productions of art .

		Why should we arrange all these conceptions , some of which transcend and some of whicth contradict the idea of beauty , under that term ?

		Beauty , indeed , is only one of the elements out of whidi the world of art is fashioned .

		The parties of the other part , who contend for literature as an instrument of use and moral improvement , have a far better case , but even they do not have the whole law in their hands .

		Much admirable literature is repugnant to the moral sense .

		If we deal with books in any large way we must read those which contaminate the mind , which hurt the soul .

		We can not ignore them and pass them by , undesr penalty of dwell - ing in a Fool 's Paradise .

		We must go down and fight with beasts at
Ephesus	LOCATION	.

		Zola has his rights as well as
St. Thomas	ORGANIZATION	a
Kempis	LOCATION	.

		Litera - ture is really the tree of the knowledge of good and evil , and the taste of it is apt to be destruc - tive to any paradise of innocence .

		It is true that our loss leaves us with a greater strength , but it is a strength of sadness rather than of joy - If we look at literature in a plain , direct way , we will find , I think , that it has four functions , four ways of serving mankind .

		It has the power to amuse , it has the power to instruct , it has the power to charm , and it has the power to exalt .

		Of course there is no hard and fast line of division between these several gifts .

		They exist side by side in the same books , and the greatest combine them all .

		A large half of the writings of men exists only to amuse .

		The amusement furnished is of all qualities .

		The shilling shocker , the lounge book for the hammock or railway journey , the mass of novels and short stories , give amuse - ment of many grades -- but amuse they must .

		Story-telling , indeed , antedated writing , and it exists where books do not penetrate .

		The an - cient Greek or Irish bard travelled on his tales of wonder and adventure , and the modern after - dinner speaker pays for his meal by hTs witty or spicy anecdotes .

		Wherever men are gathered together in relaxation , over camp-fires or in smoking-cars , they swap stories like so many embryo novelists .

		We are eternally interested in our own doings , and we endure the tales of others for the chance of telling our own .

		And we project ourselves into the stories we read , and dream them over in our own person .

		Voyages , adventures , fightings , love-makings , eatings , treasure troves , losses , crosses , pains and gains , -- no story can be dull for us which is crowded with such happenings .

		The characters may be sawdust dolls , the philosophy non-existent , the style that of the stone age .

		But if the road lengthens before us , the inn door invites , clowns crack their jokes , a dinner smokes on the table , swords flash , a lady 's dress rustles in the back - ground , a bearded pirate sits on a chest , then ennui can claim us no more that day , -- we are bound to be happy .

		The bom story-teller is a lucky fellow .

		All ears are his , and if these appendages become prodigiously lengthened un - der his treatment , it is not his fault .

		In the hands of the great novelists and dramatists the mere spectacle of life merges into deeper things .

		It becomes romance which intoxicates , comedy whose mockery makes us meditate , or tragedy whose sorrow shakes our souls .

		The fact that imaginative literature can in - struct is anathema to the average writer on aes - thetic .

		He quotes De Quincey 's distinction be - tween the literature of knowledge and the lit - erature of power , and relegates all writing that is of use to the former category .

		The distinc - tion is a valuable one , but may be pushed too far .

		The great books of the literature of knowl - edge , the works of the philosophers , are full to the brim with ideas of power .

		They may be couched in the most abstract form , but their total effect is to raise in our minds images of
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL pomp and grandeur and gloom .

		They picture forth the ` dark foundations of man 's estate ' and the arches and fabrics of glory which spnng therefrom .

		And equally the literature of power is instinct with knowledge .

		In fact , a great part of all we know comes from ihe works of the imagination we have read .

		The shop-girl learns propriety and good manners and the art of dress from the novels she devours .

		How many people are there who have got all their history from
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and
Scott	PERSON	and
Dumas	PERSON	!

		It is very inexact history , but more vivid , more real , more essentially true , than that of the chron - iclers .

		Our manners , our customs , our fads , we take largely from the poets and fiction writers .

		Dramas and novels have moulded the characters of millions .

		Smelling-bottles come or go in vogue as our favorite heroines are given to faint - ing fits or field sports .

		Virtue itself depends a good deal on the nod of a Lovelace or a Eoches - ter .

		Werther imparts to a whole generation a turn for revolution and suicide .

		Mankind in - deed is very chameleon , and changes its hues with great rapidity as the fiction writer dictates .

		Literature 's power to charm is its most per - suasive , almost its most wonderful gift .

		Very often those who feel this charm the most desire nothing more from books .

		The form , the sound , the color of verse , the grace and glitter of style in prose , enchants them .

		They go about haunt ^ by beautiful phrases ; the spell of melodious words is on their Hps .

		They have drunk the wine of Circe , they live in the garden of
Acrasia	LOCATION	-- ' seated in hearing of a hundred streams . '

		Xoble landscapes fold them round , the blue opens above filled with white or col - ored clouds , and beneath beautiftil figures rise from the wave with inviting arms .

		But per - sisted in too long , such delights enervate the mind .

		The man loses his wings to soar and his trained muscles to climb .

		Soon the witch of the place comes and dashes a few drops of water in his face , and he loses , too , his human form .

		He grovels at the enchantress ' foot , and if a Ulys - ses or a Sir
Guyon	PERSON	comes to rescue him he will not leave the place .

		The decadence of every literature dates from the day when it gave way to charm , -- when it abandoned the painful ways of lofty thought , the stress of stormy conflict , and sank back to cultivate beauty and prettineas and peace .

		But within limits subject to the rule of the mastering spirit , charm is the most potent weapon in the armory of art .

		It attracts , al - lures , rewards .

		In the form of style it eternizes conceptions which wotdd be forgotten without it .

		It is nearly the whole equipment of the second order of creative minds .

		Sophocles , Menander ,
Horace	PERSON	,
Virgil	PERSON	, and their compeers , are its ma - gicians .

		And its spell is even more profound in the pages of the greater men .

		Amusement is good , instructioia is good , charm is best of all ; but if tnese gifts were all ^ that literattire had to proffer , it could hardly justify its claim to be the gtiide and guardian of humanity .

		Taking literature in its widest sweep , which embraces religion and philoeophy , it inspires and exalts .

		Religion is more than lit - erature , but it is at least that .

		Philosophy is other than literature , but it is that also .

		And the greater works of the imaginative reason are so inwoven with religion and philosophy that we can not separate the strands .

		Literature may do its deed of direction in many ways , its voice of inspiration and exalta - tion may ring out in many tones .

		It may work by direct ethical discourse , as in the great preachers and teachers and moralists .

		It may present pure and perfect ideals in dramatic or allegorical form , as in the poets of abstractions ,
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	and
Schiller	PERSON	and
Shelley	PERSON	.

		It may tear away the veU of sense from nature and show us an apparent void beyond , as do the last of the philoeophers ,
Kant	PERSON	and
Schopenhauer	PERSON	.

		It may raise its voice in flat rebellion .

		It may call on us to desert the mosque for the tavern with Omar , or draw us to revel and defy with
Don Juan	PERSON	, or urge us to curse with
Cain	PERSON	, or inspire us to fight with indomitable courage witii Lucifer .

		Or , lastly , it may present us , a & it does by the hands of the greatest poets , with pictures of humaniiy and the universe , in their essence as they are , concentrated and made in - telligible .

		It may show us the contrast be - tween the greatness of man 's soul and the brevity of Ms life , the apparent littleness of his fate .

		It may show us good and evil in their most tremendous realities , and leave us to make our choice .

		Wherever there is seriousness of purpose , ene ^ g ^ ' of thought , vividness of form , there a greatness lives in literature which can inspirit and exalt More than anything else , humanitv needs the shock of great minds .

		It matters comparatively little whether it receives this shock from minds which communicate the ecstacy of joy , the rapture of holiness , the tri - umph of strife , or the terror of despair .

		All of these emotions are good for us .

		They lift and move and drive us out of the monotony and dulness and stagnation of ordinary existence .

		A
Schoolmate of Edward riTZGERAJLD	ORGANIZATION	.

		* The interest , one might almost say the charm , attaching to the name and personality of
Edward FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	will attract many read - ers , otherwise indifferent , to the collection of letters which Mrs.
Catharine Bodham	PERSON	-LRB-
Donne	ORGANIZATION	-RRB-
Johnson	PERSON	has carefully edited and annotated , and has entitled '' ^
William Bodham Donne	PERSON	and his Friends ; ' for among these letters are forty - five , hitherto unpublished , from
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	to his life-long friend
Donne	PERSON	-LRB- or , in half a dozen instances , to some member of
Donne	ORGANIZATION	's family -RRB- .

		Mr.
W. Aldis Wright	PERSON	's editions of the Fitz -
Gerald	PERSON	letters contain but twenty-two ad - dressed to
Donne	PERSON	, none of which are here republished .

		These new letters seem quite as characteristic of their writer as the twenty-two selected by Mr.
Wright	PERSON	.

		Letters to and from
Bernard Barton	PERSON	,
Fanny Kemble	PERSON	,
John M. Kemble	PERSON	, and
E. C. Trench	ORGANIZATION	, are conspicuously present in the volume ; but the name most often on the pen of all these writers is that of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	, to whom the index gives eigthy - two references , more than are entered under any other name , even including that of
Donne	PERSON	himself .

		That the
Woodbridge	PERSON	recluse shotuld have served thus in some sort as a conmion bond of sympathy to unite this amiable and interesting group of correspondents , increases our fondness for him and sets us to pondering anew on that mysterious something in his character that has taken captive the affections of so many and is likely to win him still other friends among the yet unborn .

		Of
William Bodham Doaine	PERSON	's life-history , this book has little to say of a formal nature , that little being said chiefly in the editor 's introduction .

		The main outlines of his biogra - phy , as elsewhere chTOnicled , can be soon given .

		The intermingling of
Donne	ORGANIZATION	,
Bodham	LOCATION	,
Cowper	PERSON	and
Johnson	PERSON	blood in the family pedi - gree need not here greatly concern us .

		Mrs.
Johnson	PERSON	speaks of the poet
Cowper	PERSON	as
Donne	PERSON	's cousin ; but it was a distant oousinship , the poet 's mother -LRB- whose maiden name was
Donne	PERSON	-RRB- being great-aunt to both
Donne	PERSON	's par - ents , and
Donne	PERSON	's great-aunt , Mrs.
Anne Bod	PERSON	- ham , being also cousin to the poet , while the whole Donne-Cowper-Johnson company trace their descent from
William Donne	PERSON	, a

seventeenth century	DATE	, and through him claim the poet

Henry Barham Johnson	PERSON	, both man and wife having
Donne	PERSON	and
Johnson	PERSON	blood commingled in their veins .

		But in spite of so much breed - ing in and in , the Donnes seem to have made their modest mark in very creditable fashion .

		Out own particular hero , bom in
1807	DATE	, and thus two years older than
FitzGerald	PERSON	, was edu - cated at the grammar school of
Bury St. Edmunds	LOCATION	, where he formed lasting friendships with
Edward FitzGerald	PERSON	,
James Spedding	PERSON	, and
John Mitchell Kemble	PERSON	, and at
Caius College	ORGANIZATION	,
Cambridge	LOCATION	, where he Joined with eleven others of future fame in founding the so-called Apostles ' Club -- properly the
Cambridge	LOCATION	Con - versazione Club .

		Conscientious scruples against signing the Thitry-nine Articles prevented his graduating .

		The
Kemble	PERSON	connection doubtless influenced him in turning his attention to the drama , and opened the way to his succeeding
J. M. Kemble	PERSON	as
Examiner of Plays	ORGANIZATION	in
1857	DATE	, a post which failing health forced him to resign in
1874	DATE	.

		He had previously held the librariansihip of the newly established
London	LOCATION	Library , and had refused the editorship of the
Edinburgh Eeview	LOCATION	on the ground that his retired habits kept him uninformed as to cur - rent events , political and literary .

		A rather rash step , as it appears to the reader , was his marriage at twenty-three , with little but the profession of * poor gentleman ' to look to for support , to his kinswoman
Catharine Hewitt	PERSON	, who was certainly old enough to have known better , being nine years her husband 's senior .

		The mothers of
William	LOCATION	and
Catharine	PERSON	were first cousins , and thus the family tradition of cousinly alliances was piously followed .

		By the generous self-denial of
Donne	PERSON	's mother the young couple were established on the maternal estate at
Mattishall	LOCATION	, in
Norfolk	LOCATION	, and there , in nearly as brief space as nature allows in such matters , they increased their country 's popu - lation by five , -- three sons and two daughters , who all grew to maturity , and one of whom married a daughter of their father 's old friend
Kemble	PERSON	.

		Much magazine and review writing of the best sort stands to
Donne	PERSON	's credit , also the ` Euripides ' and ` Tacitus ' in Lucas Col - lins 's ` Ancient Classics for Eiiglish Eeaders , ' the editing of several works for
Weale	ORGANIZATION	's classi - cal series , many contributions to Dr.
Smith	PERSON	's classical dictionaries , and other literary work of merit .

		He was a fine scholar , with a grace - ful gift for verse and a delicate humor .

		THE DIAL 11 In oommon with so many of his friends ,
Bonne	PERSON	was an admirer of
Fanny Kemble	ORGANIZATION	.

		Writing to Trench in
1829	DATE	, he says of her * Jidiet ' at Covent Grarden , that it ` creates snch a sensation in
London	LOCATION	that
Drury Lane	PERSON	, I understand , is saved from emptiness , and blank cheques , by the overflow from Covent Garden / He attributes her success to ` her ideality of impersonation / From the many let - ters written to her by
Donne	PERSON	in later life , one paragraph may be selected as illustrating his eclecticism in matters of religion .

		`
Frederic Maurice	PERSON	has at length got some preferment , not much worth the having , but nevertheless he has passed the barrier , and prob - ably will rise higher ere long .

		He is come to a parish in our part of the town -- and to a church which you may remember at the bottom of Wim - pole St. and at the comer of
Wigmore St.	ORGANIZATION	We shall resort to him : and I shall have within a circle of a quarter of a mile three such pulpit oratoirs as content me ,
viz.	LOCATION	,
J. J. Tayler	PERSON	, Mar - tineau , and
Maurice	PERSON	, nor will their doctrines be discordant in any material respect , as without concert and in ostensible opposition , all three have weeded their doctrine of many of the incum - brances of the Church of
England	LOCATION	. '

		His intimacy with
E. C. Trench	ORGANIZATION	permitted him to indulge in a Kttle innocent mischief with his serious-minded friend .

		When the future archbishop was writing his * Lessons in Proverbs ' he asked
Donne	PERSON	for such specimens of aphoristic wisdom as he could furnish . '

		Have you this one , ' asked
Donne	PERSON	, -- * No fool so big but there 's a bigger at his funeral ? ''

		`
Xo	ORGANIZATION	, ' replied the collector of old saws , and was proceeding to write it down when some - thing made him look up in time to catch a twinkle in his friend 's eye ; whereupon he taxed him with inventing the proverb , which the culprit could not deny .

		Soon after remor - ing to Bury St.
Edmunds	PERSON	, to enter his boys in his old alma mater there , he wrote humor - ously to Trench of his somewhat chaotic con - dition .

		He says : ` The number of Trades I have exercised in my own person of late astonishes me , my genius does not lie in history or criticism , but in uphol - stery and kindred manual acts .

		I have earned my bread for a month honestly , and I regard my month 's hard-labour with some pride .

		I have one sitting-room carpeted , and a bed to lie on , and have had `` losses go to -- and wise fellow enough '' and if I have not two gowns I have two gardens .

Scotland	LOCATION	.

		This is worshipful intelli - gence , but I am going to try and oblige him see - ing that in the end I may repay my charges in moving . '

		In a letter to

		`` Shall this fellow live ? ''

		AD authors are in danger from him , and should unite against him .

		And you have such an oppor - tunity as does not fall to every one 's lot of quiet - ing him . '

		And now for a truly characteristic bit from
E. F. G.	ORGANIZATION	himself .

		In the
late summer of 1863	DATE	, while enjoying his dolce far niente in his boat , somewhere about Lowestoft we infer , he writes a letter to
Donne	PERSON	, of which the following much be-capitaled passage has the familiar sound and the familiar look .

		* I think you would like this Bawdsey -LRB- though the Name should hardly be mentioned to Esirs polite -RRB- : only about a dozen Fishermen 's Houses , ■ btiilt where our Eiver runs into the Sea over a foaming Bar : on one side of which is a good sand to
Felixstowe	LOCATION	and on the other an orange - coloured Crag Cliff towards Oxford Haven : not a single respectable
House	ORGANIZATION	, or Inhabitant , or Lodger : no white Cravats ; an Inn with scarce Table or Chair : and only Bread and Cheese to eat .

		I often lie there in my Boat : I wish you would come and do so .

		But now I have got my Boat back , I think we are in for wet weather : which we shall all be glad of .

		Capital harvests everywhere : and even the Green Crops much better off than I have seen them in much less dry Seasons .

		There have been great dews that have kept their Tails up .

		One night when I was becalmed going to
Holland	LOCATION	the sails reeked as after a three hours ' Bain ; and strange Fish with blue Uns came up and fol - lowed in such wake as the Boat made .

		They looked ghastly and haunted me in a Dream ! '

		A few sentences from a letter written by
Fanny Kemble	ORGANIZATION	to
Donne	PERSON	in
1857	DATE	show us poor
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	playing the pathetically uncon - genial part of Benedick .

		He and
Lucy Barton	PERSON	had recently entered on their short and lam - entable experience of married life .

		` Ed
FitzGerald	PERSON	has taken rooms at 24
Portland Terrace	LOCATION	for 3 months , much to my delight , for he is within reach , much to his own discomfiture , for the rooms it seems are dark and dismal , looking forward on the wild beasts -LSB- in the Zoological Gardens -RSB- , looking backward on a cemetery .

		The paper of his sitting-room is a dark , indeed , an invisible green , the windows are narrow , and he says that `` his contemporary '' -- which , being interpreted , means his wife !

		looks in this chamber of horrors like
Lucrezia Borgia	LOCATION	.

		Most extraordi - nary of Benedicks is our friend .

		He talks like
Bluebeard	ORGANIZATION	.

		Speaks `` O ` leaping o'er the line '' ; really distresses even
Spedding	PERSON	's well-regulated t2 THE DIAL , -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, mind .

		I have however so much confidence in him that I believe all this irony with a rooted regard for Lucy , and so much confidence in
Lucy	LOCATION	as to believe she 'll tame Petruchio , swagger as he list .

		Yet for the present I agree with your sister .

		^ ` Your account , '' quoth she , `` of
Edward FitzGer	PERSON	- ald is very droll , but not comfortable I think .

		At least if I was his wife , I should not like him even to play at being bored by me .

		I think my woman 's feeling would revolt at that , and my woman 's folly , at being called the ` Contempo - rary ! ' '' '

		An anecdote illustrating
Donne	PERSON	's extreme of scrupulousness in the censorship of plays is worth repeating .

		He is said never to have suffered the word * God ' to be uttered on the stage .

		One day a caller found him engaged with his children in looking over manuscripts .

		On entering the caller heard a voice say , * Here 's another God , father ; ' to which the answer came , * Very well , my dear , cross him out and put '' heaven '' as usual . '

		The follow - ing from a letter to
Fanny Kemble	PERSON	, refers to the abdicated censorship and to another matter of some interest .

		The date is
Aug. 35 , 1874	DATE	.

		* My abdication is not without its pleasures .

		The Queen , by the pen of her Privy-Purse-Keeper ,
Sir T. M. Biddulph	PERSON	, has sent me a very kind message of regret at my resignation and of sat - isfaction with my jurisdiction during my reign of 17 years .

Donne	PERSON	to have been bom in

		Problems of
Ouk National	ORGANIZATION	,
Administration	ORGANIZATION	.

		* In the preface to his work on ' The
National Administration	ORGANIZATION	of the
United States	LOCATION	, ' Dr.
Fairlie	PERSON	calls attention to the faict that very little has been written on the administrative side of our government , though other features have been treated exhaustively by careful com - mentators .

		No further apology was necessary to justify the publication of this book .

		The intelligent layman of to-day may have a pretty accurate idea of the powers of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and even of how its routine business is carried on ; he may also know enough of the Judiciary to feel confident of his ability to discuss it with some degree of intelligence ; of course he is familiar with the Executive , and talks readily of the Cabinet ; but if asked to explain in detail the duties and methods of these oflSces , he probably would beat a hasty retreat .

		To supply the deficiency of such knowledge is the task Dr.
Fairlie	PERSON	has undertaken .

		Two chap - ters of the book are devoted to the President , one to the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	and
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, one to the Cabinet and its members , one to
Administra	LOCATION	- tive Organization , one to each of the depart - ments of the Cabinet , and one to the Detached Bureaus .

		The duties of the officials in these departments , and their methods of performing them , are explained in detail .

		Naturally , the President , the chief executive ofi & cer , is considered first , and attention is given to his power of appointment and removal .

		A century ` ago there were about four hundred Presidential offices ; to-day there are over six thousand , with over
twelve millions of dollars	MONEY	in salaries , none of which is pro- tected by the
Civil Service	ORGANIZATION	regulations , or can be , according to Dr.
Fairlie	PERSON	.

		While the right to select these officers nominally belongs to the President , in practice the selections are virtually m ` ade by Senators , sometimes by
Representa	LOCATION	- tives , -- for the two - fold reason that one man could not be expected to look into the details of the qualifications of so many applicants , , and that the Senators wish a share in the
National	ORGANIZATION	ptatronage .

		As a remedy for this evil , and as an offset to centralization in administration , the author suggests decentral - ization of administration , giving the appoint - ment of local officers to state governors .

		Another source of abuse , not mentioned by the author , is found in the power of appointing during a recess of the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, with commis - sions running to the close of the next session .

The National Administration	ORGANIZATION	of the
United States of America	LOCATION	.

John A. Fairlie	PERSON	, Ph.D. .


New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.


1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 18 Through this power the Executive may keep in office a man not acceptable to the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	.

		A notorious case was that of Dr.
Crum	PERSON	, col - lector at
Charleston	LOCATION	, who was repeatedly ap - pointed after his rejection by the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	.

		In nothing , perhaps , does the history of our government contrast more sharply with that of the European governments than in the powers and functions of the Executive .

		While the monarchs of
Europe	LOCATION	have been slowly los - ing their prerogatives through usurpations by the legislatures , our Executive has been steadily gaining ground .

		Though made chiefly responsible for the administration , in the early days his powers of direction were held to be small .

		Indeed , so late as 1835 a
United States	LOCATION	judge held that inferior officers , even members of the Cabinet , were bound to execute the duties of their offices according to their own judgment , not Eiccording to the direction of the President .

		But this decision had just been anticipated by a strong Executive ,
Andrew Jackson	PERSON	, who held that his own views of the Constitution were worth as much as those of
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	.

		In this case he secured obedience through the power of dis - missal , when his Secretary of the
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	would not cease depositing the funds of the government with the
United States Bank	ORGANIZATION	, though the matter was left to his discretion by law .

		The growth of the prerogative has been remarkable in the ordinance power .

		This is one of the residuary powers of the Crown in
England	LOCATION	, but here it is largely a development .

		In many cases the power is expressly conferred by statute ; in others , says Dr.
Fairlie	PERSON	, is is ` an exercise of constitutional executive powers . '

		But this power is closely related to , if not a part of , the legislative power , a thing which
Congress	ORGANIZATION	can not delegate .

		The establishment of a ` penal s -RCB- ` stem with a code of penalties and a s ^ - stem of proceedure , ' as in the regula - tions governing the revenue-cutter service , has a rather shaky basis in the oath of the
Execu	LOCATION	- tive to see that the laws are faithfully executed .

		It is the business of the legislature to provide the ways and means ; if it fails to do this , the blame rests with it .

		The Presi - dent is authorized to send and receive ambas - sadors ; but when two of our most highly esteemed Executives , ^ jMadison and
Monroe	PERSON	, ventured to create the office of ambassador and fill it during a recess of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, they were rebuked therefor , though the business was urgent .

		As he is to execute the laws , their first inter - pretation rests with the President .

		Jefferson ,
Jackson	PERSON	, and Lincoln claimed powers coor - dinate with the judiciary in this respect , and refused to follow its decision in at least one case each .

		Much has been said from time to time about legislation by judicial interpreta - tion .

		A remarkable case of Executive legisla - tion may be found in the famous pension order of
last year	DATE	, which decreed that the attain - men of a certain age was sufficient evidence of disability , regardless of actual physical condi - tion , to entitle soldiers to pensions .

		The second chapter , on ' The Executive , ' is devoted mainly to Foreign Relations and
Mili	PERSON	- tary Powers .

		Perhaps it is in the latter that the prerogative has seen its freest development .

		Just here Dr.
Fairlie	PERSON	's treatment is not alto - gether satisfacton ' .

		He correctly says that it is difficult to draw a line of demarcation between the authority of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and that of the President , but indicates that
Congress	ORGANIZATION	regulates matters of permanent importance , while the President determines those cif a tem - porary nature .

		It may be questioned , how - ever , if the President is thus limited in prac - tice .

		President Lincoln once increased the standing army , though this is a precedent not likely to be followed , even under like neces - sity .

		But he prescribed ' Instructions for the Government of the Armies in the Field ' which are still used , though they appear to fall within the power of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	to ' make rules for the government of the land and naval forces . '

		The power of the President as a military governor , exercised through the War Depart - ment , over conquered territory , are well set forth in a few sentences .

		The Insular Cases are cited to show that , after the cessation of hostilities , neither he nor his subordinates can impose duties on goods passing between the
United States	LOCATION	and ceded territory .

		The public has accepted this as law , and now would like to know by what authority the
Secretarj	PERSON	- of the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	imposes duties on goods imported into
Tutuila	LOCATION	,
Samoa	LOCATION	, from the
United States	LOCATION	, and admits goods there from foreign coimtries under laws not prescribed by
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, while the Secretary of the
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	admits goods which have paid these duties in
Samoa	LOCATION	to the
United States	LOCATION	free of duty .

		Perhaps the power to suspend and amend state laws and to disperse a state legislature , not mentioned in this book , is not recognized as legitimate , but it was exercised by President Lincoln in
Mary	PERSON	- land and
Delaware	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
Fairlie	PERSON	finds only two remedies against the action of the President -- impeachment , and the refusal of the courts to execute uncon - stitutional orders .

		The statement that ' when the writ of habeas corpus was opposed by the orders of the President , the court declined to take further action , ' is misleading .

		What 14 THE DIAL , -LSB- Jaly 1 ,
Chief Justice Taney	ORGANIZATION	actually did was to file his opinion and confess himself helpless before the superior military power .

		The ' varied industries ' of the
Treasury Department	ORGANIZATION	are set forth in detail .

		While the collection and disbursement of the revenue is its main business , it performs many other duties , some of which -- such as the life-sav - ing and public-health service , and the super - vision of the
Bureau of Printing	ORGANIZATION	and
Engrav	PERSON	- ing -- would seem to belong more appropri - ately elsewhere .

		The pages devoted to the Currency and Banking are not altogether satis - factory , for after reading them one still carries with him a somewhat hazy notion of the sub - ject .

		However , an exposition which would really clarify it hardly falls within the prov - ince of the author , so far as he is concerned merely with administration .

		The book is written in a readable style , which is all that may be fairly expected of one which simply attempts to set forth the details of administrative work as they actually exist , with a minimum of criticism and suggestion .

		For the most part it is easily understood ; but after repeated readings , one paragraph , that on the Collection of Internal Revenue -LRB- p. 110 -RRB- , still remains more or less incomprehen -

		1741 , since which time no complete reprint has appeared until now .

		Yet the work , for its manner as fully as for its contents , is well worthy of a modern revival .

		Louis-Armond , le Baron de Lahontan et Hesteohe , was a native of
Beam	ORGANIZATION	, and was born on the French slopes of the
Pyrenees	LOCATION	.

		Inherit - ing a dilapidated estate , he sought his for - tunes in the ' marine corps ' -- that portion of the army entrusted with the care of the colo - nies ; and in
1883	DATE	, at seventeen years of age , he began his wandering career in
Xew France	LOCATION	.

		For ten years he lived the adventurous life of a soldier , a courier , and an explorer , and saw the new world of
France	LOCATION	from
Quebec	LOCATION	to the sources of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	, and back again to 1 ^ ewfoundland .

		In an evil hour , in
1793	DATE	, he was driven by the persecutions of his superior officer to fly from his post ; and from that hour to his death , in
1715	DATE	, he was a man with - out a country , although probably not in penury , owing to the popularity of his remark - able book .

		Those were the days to which Mr.
Austin Dobson	PERSON	assigns a court-life where ' All went naked save the truth , ' and to such a jaded and satiated public a book like Lahontan 's was a godsend .

		As Mr.
Thwaites	PERSON	observes : ` Lahontan recounted not only Ma own adven - tures and the important events that occurred beneath his eyes in the mueh-talked-of region of
New France	LOCATION	, but drew a picture of the simple delights of life in the wilderness more graphic than had yet been presented to the European world .

		In the pages of Lahontan the child of nature was depicted as a creature of rare beauty of form , a rational being thinking deep thoughts on great subjects , but freed from the trammels and frets of civilization , bound by none of its restrictions , obedient only to the will and caprice of his own nature .

		In this American Arcady were no courts , laws , police , ministers of state , or other hampering paraphernalia of government ; each man was a law unto himself , and did what seemed good in his own eyes .

		Here were no monks and priests , with their strictures and ascet - icisms , but a natural , sweetly reasonable religion .

		Here no vulgar love of money pursued the peace - ful native in his leafy home ; without distinction of property , the rich man was he who might give most generously .

		Aboriginal marriage was no fet - tering life-covenant , but an arrangement pleasing the convenience of the contracting parties .

		Man , innocent and unadorned , passed his life in the pleasures of the chase , warring only in the cause of the nation , scorning the supposititious benefits of civilization , and free from its diseases , misery , sycophancy , and oppression .

		In short , the
Ameri	PERSON	- can wilderness was the seat of serenity and noble philosophy . '

		One is tempted to quote at length from Mr.
Thwaites	PERSON	's most admirable essay , in which he sums up the philosophy of this caustic and embittered son of the south ; for it were idle to attempt to re-state what he has stated , once

		THE
DIAX	ORGANIZATION	, 16 for all , in beautifully fit and appreciative lan - guage .

		Again he says : ` During his protracted sea - voyages , unending days in wilderness garrisons , and long months of cam - paigning in gloomy forests , Lahontan brooded upon the blemishes of civilization , contrasting it caustically with the simplicity of barbarism , and erecting an ideal system of savage perfection , which he used as a whip to lash the vices of his time .

		With the European passion for money , he compares the communal life of the
North Ajneri	LOCATION	- can aborigine , who seeks to satisfy only his immediate needs , and shares his possessions with whoever needs them : over against the servile caste spirit of the courtier , he places the proud independence of each Indian warrior : with the rigid bonds of the married state , he contrasts the easy libertinism of the barbarian : with the elab - orate ritual and dogmas of the church , the primi - tive native myths of the sons of the forest .

		The comforts and luxuries of civilization are ridi - culed , while the hardships and paucity of wilder - ness life are minimized .

		In short -- to quote the words of his marvellous Huronian ,
Adario	PERSON	, `` The Great Spirit has vouchsafed us an honest mould , while wickedness nestles in yours : and that he sends you into our country in order to have an opportunity of correcting your Faults , and fol - lowing our Example . '' '

		As one reads , he recognizes on the one hand the scoffing satire of that famous Latin-writer who was Lahontan 's favorite ,
Lucian	PERSON	; and on the other he sees by anticipation the dreams for society of the Encyclopaedists and of the ` Contrat Social . '

		He realizes , amid all the bitterness and scurrillity the soul of a man who , in the heart of the great solitudes or in the companionship of the individualized sav - age , gets nearer to nature 's God , and to the true worth of life and service .

		There is a tonic inspiration about it which is akin to that which to-day stirs us in the aspiration and achieve - ment of that newest race in the far East which is holding every gaze .

		* During the past decade there has been a constantly increasing interest in -RSB- Municipal Art , which has culminated in definite accom - plishment of no mean proportions .

		Still , there has been no great popular demand or move - ment , and the recognition of the great impor - tance of Civic Art to a communitv is as yet confined to a comparatively small number of earnest individuals who believe that utility can be greatly aided by good taste .

New York	LOCATION	:
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons , utter disregard of appearances and immediate surroundings .

		A discriminating observer can hardly fail to be deeply impressed with the inoongruity of all that man has added to the surface of the earth .

		He has outraged natural beauties with such atrocious habitations and monuments that he has actually created a taste among the masses for the ugly and inhar - monious .

		Many attractive regions have been artistically and picturesquely ruined by his insistent and overbearing personality expressed in suppositious architectural forms .

		He has imposed upon us by the glitter of gold , and blinded our eyes by quantity rather than qijaUty .

		Frankly , he has given us that which we could appreciate most for the time being ; but we are at last awakening to the fact that this gold is not without alloy .

		The blinding glitter is not now enough to hide its ugly shape , and we hope and pray that he will soon begin to express himself in forms of sjTnmetry and stateliness .

		He has scarred the face of the country , and done his deadly work in raising false standards ; but it is not yet too late for him to turn and express himself , where the community is concerned , in artistic terms with a harmonious environment .

		It is essential that he should not be indifferent , but should lead in the right education of the people .

		And this is the crux of the Municipal Art situation : the awakening of an unenlightened public , first to the knowledge of what civic beauty means , and second to the possibility of attaining it .

		That the great masses are steeped in igno - rance of its meaning , and that a large majority of the wealthy are coldly indifferent to its attainment , are two facts that are constantly impressed upon those who have had anything to do with Civic Art .

		The best ways of edu - cating the one and overcoming the oftimes hostile indifference of the other have been among the serious questions considered by Municipal Art Societies .

		Plans that required the backing of the city , the state , and some - times the nation , have had to be abandoned , and effort has been resolved into one idea , which has finally become paramount , that of education .

		It is really an education of the eye , by examples of what has already been done in a simple way in this country , and also by showing how much the rest of the world has accomplished .

		Among the practical aids which this move - ment has received , two books by Mr.
Charles Mulford Eobinson	PERSON	must be given a prominent place .

		Of one of these books , * Modem Civic Art , or the
City Made Beautiful	ORGANIZATION	/ a new edi - tion has appeared , delightfully illustrated with views of places noted for their interest and beauty .

		In the preface to this edition .

		Mr. 16
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
July 1	DATE	,
Eobinson	PERSON	says that nothing has been more remarkable than the growth of the civic im - provement movement during the last few years .

		Upwards of twelve hundred societies are now recorded , and the interchange of experiences and methods is of the greatest value .

		These clubs come in contact with each other through national organizations .

		He also thinks , so valuable are the suggestions that can be exchanged , that it is possible to have a litera - ture of the subject that would be international .

		It has been felt that a general awakening to the benefits of Municipal Art vfould at no dis - tant date result in a demand for its considera - tion upon all suitable occasions .

		Its advocates have therefore been interested in methods of reaching the greatest number of people , and have eoncludied that the direct appeal to the eye is far superior to all others .

		No more important educational example was ever placed before Americans than the World 's Fair of
1903	DATE	; and we firmly believe that no influence has been more potent in awakening a taste for Civic Art .

		Not that we would wish an infinite num - ber of ' White Cities ' to spring up all over the country , but that the idea of harmony should enter more largely into the building of our towns ; that the situation should conform to the topography of the land , and that every natural beauty should be preserved and en - hanced .

		Mr.
Eobinson	PERSON	has realized this , and in his various chapters has taken up the possi - bilities of Civic Art and shown why certain cities are successful examples and how others can be made so .

		Civic Art is good , sound , practical reasoning , deduced from the experi - ence of the ages , and meant for the masses of the people . '

		Loving beauty , it loves humanity yet better .

		It wants the surroundings of men to be clean , wholesome , and uplifting , as well as pleasant to see .

		Personified , modern Civic Art appears as a sort of a social reformer ; for if the eye be that of the artist , there is surely yet in it the tear of the philanthropist . '

		Many people seem to think that art is some - thing so impracticable , so superficial , so easily acquired when wealth comes , that it can have nothing to do with the foundation of things .

		They do not require or ask the same standard of perfection in what their eyes rest upon as they do in the working of a machine .

		They are content with that which is imperfect and oftimes inferior on its artistic side , and only appreciate perfection in commercial things .

		And yet Civic Art is the best investment a city can make .

		It is the life of many cities of the Old World , and means
millions of dollars	MONEY	to foreign nations .

		It creates pride in its citi - zens more than any other thing can , and holds their allegiance and love .

		Municipal art is for all the people . '

		If men seek it they seek it not for art 's sake , but for the city 's .

		They are not asking the town to help art , but art to help the town : the artists , not to glorify their art , but their art to glorify the city . '

		Briefs on J ^ eav Books .

		Color-prints As appreciation of the color-prints by masters of designed by the Masters of the Japanese art .

		Popular School of Japanese Art broadens , the literature of the subject increases .

		From
San Francisco	LOCATION	-LRB-
Paul Elder & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- comes Miss
Dora Amsden	PERSON	's ` Impressions of Ukiyo-ye , ' daintily printed on Japanese paper , and bound in Japanese style , though more substantially , as is suited to our rougher way of handling books .

		The author frankly disavows the work as an ` in - dividual expression . '

		Her endeavor , she ex - plains , is * to give in condensed form the opinions of those qualified by study and research to speak with authority upon the form of Japanese art , which in its most concrete development , the Ukiyo-ye print , is now claiming the attention of the art world . '

		Were the views reflected only those of writers thus qualified , the book would have greater value .

		But from
Fenollosa	LOCATION	to
Hart	PERSON	- mann is a far cry .

		And in imagination alone can warrant be foimd for such extravagant state - ments as that ' To Ukiyo-ye the Japanese owed the gradual expansion of international conscious - ness which culminated in the revolution of
1868	DATE	, -- a revolution , the most astonishing in history , accomplished as if by miracle ; but the esoteric germ of this seemingly spontaneous growth of Meiji lay in the atelier of the artists of Ukiyo-ye . '

		Interesting , indeed , were it true !

		Equally beside the mark are the assertions that ` Japanese Art was ever dominated by the priestly hierarchy , ' and that , before the advent of Ukiyo-ye , ` the aristocratic schools had confined themselves en - tirely to representations of princely pageantry , to portraiture , and to ideal pictures of mythical per - sonages , saints , and sages . '

		Has the author never heard of the landscapes of Sesshu ,
Shubun	PERSON	, So - ami , and
Motonobu	PERSON	, or of the birds of Chokuan and Utanosuke , or of the flowers of
Korin	PERSON	and Kenzan , -- to name a few only out of the host of artists who painted these subjects ' ?

		And where did she get the notion that the ` national stage passion ' of the Japanese ` overshadows the love of any other amusement , ' or that ` it was to the persons of the actors , and the printers who spread their pictures broadcast , that the people owed the aesthetic wonders of their costume ? '

		The frequent occurrence of such misstatements as these mar what would otherwise be a very accept - able essay , readable , and giving in compact form much information useful to those who are be - coming interested in Ukiyo-ye prints .

		Errors in spelling , as
Mitsonobu	LOCATION	for

		Kano and
Katsukawa	PERSON	are not merely the designations of schools ; they are the surnames of the artists comprising these schools .

		Kano no Tanyu would be no less absurd than strange to the ear of a Japanese .

		The chap - ters on

		The chapter on * The School of

Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	,
Meredith	PERSON	,
Hawthorne	LOCATION	, Kipling and
Fitz	PERSON	-
Gerald	PERSON	-LRB- in the same chapter -RRB- ,
Delphi	ORGANIZATION	and Greek literature , and Nemesis .

		Most striking and orig - inal of all is the essay on Heam .

		What Mr.
More	PERSON	has to say about the imion of eastern and western thought , both as illustrated in
Hearn	LOCATION	and as likely to lead to further developments , is pro- foundly , and , in a way not to be briefly explained , gruesomely su ^ estive .

		There is a decidedly ori - ental touch in the essayist 's representation of love , more distinctively first love , to whose thral - dom the ' indwelling of the past ' gives a wonder - ful significance .

		` We look into the eyes of love and it is as though , through some intense and sudden stimulation of vital being , we had ob - tained -- for one supercelestial moment -- the glimpse of a reality never before imagined , and never again to be revealed .

		There is , indeed , an illusion .

		We seem to view the divine ; but this divine itself , whereby we are dazzled and duped , is a ghost .

		Our mortal sight pierces beyond the surface of the present into profundities of myri - ads of years , -- pierces beyond the mask of life into the enormous night of death .

		For a moment we are made aware of a beauty and a mystery and a depth imutterable : then the veil falls again forever . '

		Characteristic of the writer 's complexion of thought is his finding in Shakes - p -RRB- eare -- the sonnets and plays taken together -- ` one of the saddest human documents ever penned . '

		Characteristic too is his regret that Lamb is not more often altogether serious .

		As well find fault with the violet because its odor is not that of the rose , or complain of Mr.
More	PERSON	's style because its seriousness is unrelieved by the faintest touch of humor .

		This , as Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	long ago said , is like finding fault with a man six feet tall because he is not two inches taller .

		Kip - ling and
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	are linked together as being much talked about and read at the time the es - say was written , six years ago .

		Although the essayist speaks of ` comparing ' their work , the two are really , and necessarily , contrasted .

		In Crabbe the writer looks in vain for that ` sense of infinitude ' which
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	makes the mark of high poetry .

		Crabbe certainly has his limitations .

		In his chapter on
Hawthorne	LOCATION	, Mr. More dwells on
New England	LOCATION	's ` brilliant flowering and quick decay . '

		Yet it might not be impossible to say a word in defense of present-day
New England	LOCATION	.

		The last two essays , dealing with matters of Greek philosophy and poetry , are admirable in the insight they display and in their wide and firm grasp of Hellenic literature .

		Both in his fine classical scholarship and in his carefully wrought sentences , Mr.
More	PERSON	calls to mind the lamented
Walter Pater	PERSON	, although the Oxford scholar 's reading and literary sympathies , wide as they were , strike one as less comprehensive than Mr.
More	PERSON	's .

		A cordial welcome awaits such further volvunes of ` Sheiburne Essays ' as the author may see fit to publish .

		These free-and - easy chats form a tolerablj '' full autobiography of the late Mr.
Hutton	PERSON	, and are most entertaining reading , being also fully illustrated in a very attractive manner .

		An early paragraph excites one 's admiration of young
Hutton	PERSON	's manliness and independence .

		Not to be dependent on his father , who , however , appears to have been a man of means ,
Laurence	PERSON	secured a position as er - rand boy , at
four dollars	MONEY	a week , in a wholesale produce commission house , but still continued to move in polite society when off duty .

		He says , * I never felt that my overalls were very becom - ing , but I was never ashamed of them ; and when a young lady , with whwn I had danced the varsovienne one night in
Waverley Place	LOCATION	, cut me dead the next day in Broad Street , because she saw me -- in overalls -- rolling a barrel of beans across a pair of `` skidds '' on to a grocer 's wagon , I was ashamed of her ! '

		Of the innumerable good things that are every day being said by bright people ,
Hutton	PERSON	gathered up not a few .

		For example ,
H. C. Bunner	PERSON	, viewing the monu - ments of the great in
Westminster Abbey	LOCATION	, re - marked to
Hutton	PERSON	, ` There are three classes of ` Englishmen whom I can endure , -- the Irish , the Scotch , and the dead . '

		Of Miss
Ellen Terry	PERSON	we are interested to learn that , in reply to a com - ment on her commanding height as seen on the stage , she explained that she was five feet seven , but always stood on the balls of her feet , and sometimes on tiptoe .

		With a natural fellow - feeling ,
Hutton	PERSON	gives a long list of distinguished American men of letters who were without a college education ; and he elsewhere says , knowing from experience whereof he speaks , that ` he is a lucky workingman of letters who can earn , read - ily and surely , the daily wages of a plumber 's assistant or the gas man 's apprentice . '

		Of the importance of a taking book title , we are told that ' a good title is so essential that men have been known to copyright titles and then , some day perhaps , to write books to fit them . '

		This 18
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-

England	LOCATION	at least .

		Three chapters are given to Mr.
Button	PERSON	's famous collection of death masks , his ` scullery , ' as it has been irreverently styled .

		On the whole , for its wealth of literary , dramatic , and miscellan - eous reminiscences the book is one of the best of its kind .

		The editor deserves a warm word of praise for her part in the work .

Frank Abiel Flower	PERSON	, -LRB-
Saalfield Pub	ORGANIZATION	.

		Co. ,
Akron	LOCATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	. -RRB-

		This volume of nearly 500 pages is not so exhaustive of the public life of
Stanton	PERSON	as the two volumes by
Gorham	LOCATION	; but it gives more of the personal element , and , by its numerous interviews with
Stanton	PERSON	's contemporaries , pre - sents a full portraiture which the other lacks .

		It covers also the legal life of
Stanton	LOCATION	, following him through the various stations in life to which he was called .

		In addition to the many original sources drawn upon , the author has availed him - self of numerous orisrinal photographs of men and places , which add to the educational value of the work .

		The treatment is frankly eulogistic .

		* He was always great when others were little , ' says the author .

		` The Republic is his monument ; the Rebellion is his biography . '

		A prefatory schedule is made of twenty-nine achievements of
Stanton	PERSON	.

		It includes most of the important events of the War and of Reconstruction , leaving little to accredit to other participants .

		He is given credit for the prodigious industrial era which made
America	LOCATION	what it is , for putting backbone into Lin - coln , for showing
Butler	PERSON	how to capture
New Orleans	LOCATION	, for planning the capture of
Norfolk	LOCATION	and the blockade of the James river , and for creating the rams and mortar boats on the upper Missis - sippi .

		He conceived the Confiscation act , crowded Lincoln into signing the Emancipation act , armed the slaves of rebellious masters , rescued the starv - ing army of the
Cumberland	LOCATION	, saved the city of
Washington	LOCATION	, protected Grant from public wrath , prevented Lincoln and
Grant	ORGANIZATION	from giving away the fruits of victory , prevented the rehabilitation of secession , and kept President
Johnson	PERSON	from seizing ' the army and bringing on another revolu - tion .

		These claims will show that the viewpoint of the author is that of the Radicals in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and consequently of extreme hostility to
Johnson	PERSON	.

		Although a less partisan view would be desired by the general public in these days of restored good feeling , undoubtedly the stand of the author is precisely that which
Stanton	PERSON	would have wished to be taken .

		He was always a partisan and never a moderate .

		A timely and - ^ committee of the
Cobden Club	ORGANIZATION	forceful plea of
London	LOCATION	puts forth ` The Burden for Peace .

		of Armaments , a Plea for Re - trenchment , ' with the imprint of Mr.
Fisher Unwin	PERSON	, but otherwise anonymous , at a moment when the world seems to have gone mad in its desire to prepare for the greatest wars .

		The dis - proportion between this evil rivalry in the hearts of the rulers of all so-called civilized nations , and the little book put out in all wisdom and sanity as an antidote to it , is reminiscent of Wil - liam
Lloyd Garrison	PERSON	's earlier attacks upon slav - ery , and might be considered ridiculous if one did not recall that noble encouragement to right - eous men when the mob clamors without , ` One with God makes a majority . '

		But the book under consideration is much more than a mere recall to right feeling : it is no less an appeal to com - mon sense .

		Arguing from the history of naval expenditures in the immediate past , it shows the unwisdom of doing what the American nation is now doing , -- building numbers of battleships and armored cruisers , with the certainty that a few years will find them antiquated and ineffi - cient .

		It shows the folly of international panics , which are artfully used by the lovers of war for increasing their preparations .

		More particularly it illustrates the vicious circle in which interna - tional emulation is going , as in the following paragraph : ` In the past nine years .

		Great Brit - ain has constructed a larger tonnage of vessels of war than the aggregate of
France	LOCATION	,
Russia	LOCATION	, and
Germany	LOCATION	, in the proportion of 933,000 to 847,000 tons , a difference of 86,000 tons or 10 per cent ; in
1904	DATE	we were constructing at the rate of 153,000 tons as compared with 130,000 of the three other Powers , an excess of 18 per cent .

		It can not , therefore , be contended that this coun - try has followed the lead of other naval Powers .

		The truer statement would be that only constant increases of naval expenditures have been induce - ments to other Powers to follow our lead . '

		19 first decades of this century , the course of the strong , deep , pregnant current in the intellectual life of the country , which , sweeping away the classic forms and conventions , produces a natural - ism dominating the whole of literature , which from naturalization leads to radicalism , from revolt against traditional convention in literature to vigorous rebellion against religious and political reaction , and which bears in its bosom the germs of all the liberal ideas and emancipatory achieve - ments of the later periods of European civiliza - tion . '

		There needs only this statement of the theme , as the author conceives it , to make clear the fact that the task is one after his own heart , and that the present volimie , even more than the others , reflects his own positive and aggressive critical personality .

		And the volume , although written in

		Nor has he made a mere compilation of statistics in the usual fashion of state histories .

		There is enough of the personality of Indian , ex - plorer , settler , and territorial official , to make a living story .

		A vast amount of information is given in this condensed and readable shape .

		The author has been identified with
Iowa	LOCATION	for nearly sixty years , and is qualified to speak with authority .

		But so broad is his view , that the book will undoubtedly prove as interesting and valuable to the people of all the states as to those con - nected with
Iowa	LOCATION	.

		Topics like the admission of
Missouri	LOCATION	as a slave state , the Black Hawk war and others , are of national interest .

		Extracts from relations of early voyagers and pioneers are interspersed with the text , giving additional vividness to the narrative .

		A text-book of ` Elements of Psy - ^ SSg ^ !

		chologj , ' recently added to the con - siderable group that reflects the present-day interest in the subject , brings as its distinctive contribution the emphasis upon the practical reaction which the student is induced to make to the principles set before him .

		The author is Professor Thomdike , of the
Teachers ' College of Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	, who brings to his task vigor and insight , as well as the practical temper of one engaged in training teachers .

		By the constant facing of questions and exercises , the student is compelled to assume an active attitude to the pages of his text , and to reinterpret in the light of experience and reflections the conclusions which are embodied in accepted psychological doc - trine .

		Particularly for introductory study does this method possess advantages , although it inevi - tably deprives the text of a desirable literary value and consistent exposition .

		Admitting the pertinence of the method -LRB- and there are doubtless many classes in need of this form of stimulation -RRB- , one obtains from a survey of the pages an impres - sion of decided appreciation of the students ' needs and shortcomings , and likewise of the prob - able success with which the work will meet the needs of the situation .

		The excellence and com - pleteness of the chapters on the nervous system deserve special commendation .

		The book is pub - lished by
A. G. Seller	PERSON	,
Xew York	LOCATION	.

		The mine of Russian literature .

		Prince
Kropotkin	PERSON	's work on * Rus - sian literature ' -LRB- McClure -RRB- is based upon a course of lectures given by the author four years ago at the
Lowell Institute	ORGANIZATION	.

		The lectures were eight in number , and the work is in eight corresponding chapters , eked out by such additional matter as was necessary to make the historical treatment reasonably complete .

		It is essentially a history of the modem literature , for only one of the chapters is devoted to a survey of works and writers anterior to
Pushkin	LOCATION	.

		Follow - ing the discussion of the eight writers ui > on whom attention is chiefly focussed , we have a chapter 20 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	on the drama , ajiother on the folk-novelists , and a final chapter on political literature and criti - cism .

		Of the great national literature which is thus surveyed , the author speaks as follows : ` Russian literature is a rich mine of original poetic thought .

		It has a freshness and youthful - ness which is not found to the same extent in older literatures .

		It has , moreover , a sincerity and simplicity of expression which render it all the more attractive to the mind that has grown sick of literary artificiality .

		And it has this distinctive feature , that it brings within the domain of art -- the poem , the novel , the drama -- nearly all those questions , social and jwlitieal , which in
Western Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, at least in our present generation , are discussed chiefly in the political writings of the day , but seldom in literature . '

		Prince
Kropotkin	PERSON	has given us a work of absorbing interest , colored , no doubt , by his own political philosophy , but discriminat - ing and profound in its judgment of aesthetic values .

		Of the English language , as his readers well know , he is an absolute master .

		Accustomed as we are to centre all '' ZenpJnters .

		^ < > ^ ^ ^ of Greek artistic activity in architecture and sculpture , it is with some surprise that we find Miss
Irene Weir	PERSON	has ventured to write a book on ` The Greek Painters ' Art ' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- .

		But , fortunately , the author justifies her attempt by awakening her readers ' interest in various related subjects , such as Greek painting , vase painting , color as applied to architecture and sculpture , portrait , mosaic , and mural painting .

		Miss
Weir	PERSON	possesses a de - lightful enthusiasm for the Greek painters ' art , supported by knowledge of ancient and modern archaeological writings as well as a familiarity with art works .

		Of the two sources of infor - mation , literature and extant works , the latter source is far more attractive , and as the author says , the actual remains , such as Greek vases , mosaic and wall paintings , furnish us with the most interesting proof of the Greek painters ' art .

		It is these works that Miss
Weir	PERSON	describes mostly in detail .

		NOTES 46 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 47 AMERICA AT
OXFORD	LOCATION	.

		The interesting erperiment , made possible by the testament of the late
Cecil Khodes	PERSON	, of bringing a selected body of American students into relations with the university life of
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, has now been in operation for a year , and forty-three young men from this country , representing the same nun : iber of states and territories , have been enrolled during that period as members of the several colleges .

		From time to time we get a report from one or another of these young men , describing the conditions of his student life , and inevitably making comparisons of some sort with the con - ditions of life in the American university .

		One of the most frank and instructive of these reports is from Mr.
Paul Nixon	PERSON	, the first Ehodes scholar from
Connecticut	LOCATION	, and it has recently been published in the ` Keview of Reviews . '

		Some of Mr.
Nixon	PERSON	's observations are certainly of a nature to inspire reflection , and even to awaken in our minds grave doubts concerning the efl & cacy of our own educational methods .

		Mr ,
Nixon	PERSON	's first impression of his new university world was that the Oxonian spent most of his time in cultivating athletics and the social amenities , regarding his studies as a matter of secondary importance .

		Yet in spite of this surface indication to the con - tiury , the young Englishman achieved a scholastic standard which his American rival found it diflScult to equal .

		This paradox was eventually explained away by the discovery that the English student works harder at his reading during the long vacation than during term , and , taking the year round , has rather more to show for his efforts than the
Ameri	PERSON	- can student , who would scoff at the idea of wasting his play-time in study .

		Of the general equipment which the two classes of students bring to their work , the following is said : * The conviction is being pungently forced upon us Rhodians that in many respects the amount of information we 've assimilated is not to be com - pared with that of the brighter of our cousins .

		It is a fact that in general reading the more stu - dious Oxonian has us at his mercy ; in every form of classical scholarship , except that of painstaking investigation of minute obscurities , a favorite pas - time in
Germany	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, we are `` down and out . '' '

		In matters of art and literature , particularly , the difference is enormous .

		` The ordinary American collegian , maybe , has heard such names as Murillo and Titian .

		He 's an exception if even the names come to his mind spon - taneously Even our college glee-club members are occasionally unable to tell how Mozairt differs from
Wagner	PERSON	, while , so far as the majority of our collegians can say ,
Michael Angelo	PERSON	and
Dante	PERSON	might have been compatriots , contemporaries , and compeers .

		* But of these subjects the young Englishman can speak with some degree of intelligence as a , matter of course , ^ n knowledge of artists , 30 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, ancient and modern , and in appreciation of their productions , we American collegians , as a class , are immeasurably inferior to the Oxonians / Once put this situation squarely before the American pedagogue , to whom machinery is the essential thing about education , and he will offer the only remedy of which his mind can conceive -- more elementary courses in more subjects than ever before , and a still greater wasting of the educational energies .

		We have already tried the experiment with literature , and are raising up a generation to which the name of literature will evermore be hateful .

		Try it with painting and sculp - ture and music , and we shall achieve a similar result .

		If the English example teaches us anything , it is that the area covered by the work of the schools is not the all-important consideration , but rather the thoroughness with which the particular work is done , com - bined with the relegation to other times and places of those studies which the healthy - minded young person needs no artificial stimu - lus to pursue .

		The writer thus puts his finger upon a very serious fault of our educational system when he says : ` Swamped by a great number of subjects , in his pre-collegiate days especially , such as a juvenile form of astronomy and geology , the American boy is apt to become temporarily interested in one and then another of these studies , and to devote his odd hours to out-of-school reading on his momen - tary hobby rather than to reading
Scott	PERSON	,
Dickens	LOCATION	, or
Thackeray	PERSON	.

		This is all very well if he has any decided taste for one or two of these subjects which may develope with advancing years .

		Such is often the case , to be sure , but far oftener he loses his puerile interest in successive ephemeral favorites ; forgets all but the last ; and , finally , discovers his life-work without having the knowl - edge of literature that attends so naturally a more confined field of study in which the literature of the ancients is the most prominent feature . '

		In the last words of this passage we find the secret of the Englishman 's success in pro- ducing men of real culture under his univer - sity system .

		` The Englishman does not get glimmerings of countless subjects throughout his pre-collegiate days or in college .

		What he gets first he keeps getting repeated doses of , and at the completion of his university course in Literae Humaniores he is saturated with literature , philosophy , history , and economics , ancient and modern . '

		In no way , we believe , will the influence of the Ehodes foundation turn out to be farther - reaching than in thus providing , for an ever - increasing number of picked young Americans , this comparative object-lesson in the respective aims and results of the university systems of the two countries .

		Mr.
Nixon	PERSON	is candid enough to admit that the
American Ehodes	ORGANIZATION	scholar finds himself at a disadvantage all along the line .

		The stu - dent of science is in the best case , for he at least , in his chosen field , is able to outshine his English rival , although even ' among his scientific Oxonian acquaintances he is apt to be a silent partner in conversation ' when topics related to general culture are up for discussion .

		The student of law finds himself in much the same position as the classical student , for he rarely has , what his English fellow-student almost invariably has , an ade - quate equipment in the ' combined study of ancient and modern history , economics , phi - losophy , and classical literature , which the additional reading of modern literature so readily follows . '

		And even as a preparation for intelligent citizenship the English system , which we so lightly stigmatize as narrow , approves itself by its results .

		A comparison between the university graduates who are mem - bers , respectively , of the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	and the
House of Eepresentatives	ORGANIZATION	, would not be at all agreeable to our national sense of self-esteem .

		The English student turns , ' quite as a matter of course , from
Demosthenes	LOCATION	to
Chamberlain	PERSON	's latest speech , -- or , rather , from the latter to
Demosthenes	LOCATION	, -- for knowledge of current affairs is evidently considered to be of paramount importance . '

		The American stu - dent does nothing of the sort , as we know full well ; it is even doubtful if he reads anything more than the headlines of the speech , by which we mean , of course , the analogue of the speech in the demagogic oratory of our own country .

		The comparisons made inevitable by the Ehodes experiment are far from flattering to us , but they should be salutary for correction .

		And it must be remembered that our short - comings are emphasized by the fact that the
American Ehodes	ORGANIZATION	scholar has had from two to four years more training of some sort than the English youth with whom he is brought into competition .

		We have in the past made what protest we could against this perversion of the Ehodes trust , and that question does not now concern us .

		But the condition result - ing from it gives added point to any such exhibition as is made by Mr.
Nixon	PERSON	's report , and by the other reports of similar tenor that have come to us since the American invasion of
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		If the English schoolboy just entering college is more seriously educated than the American student who is at least half way through his college work , the fact can not be too widely advertised , and we can not any too soon set about discovering the causes of the difference and seeking for the desired remedy .

		Greek Thevkers axd Their Philosophy .

		* Professor
Gomperz	PERSON	's ' Greek Thinkers ' is a more readable , but , except in the omission of philological detail , not a more superficial history of Greek Philosophy than the exhaust - ive treatise of
Zeller	PERSON	.

		In a review of the first volume -LRB- The Dial ,
Aug. 16 , 1901	DATE	-RRB- , I pointed out some of the author 's eminent qualifications for his task , -- his brilliant if not always pure style , his instinct for the vivid and character - istic trait , the breadth and discursive range of his thought and reading , his quick , some - times super-subtle , apprehension of modern analogies , and last but not least his frank adoption of the point of view of positive science .

		These qualities are still manifest in the second volume -- which now appears as Volumes II .

		and
III	ORGANIZATION	.

		of the English trans - lation , -- though there is perhaps less opportu - nity for their display in an analytic resume of the Platonic dialogues than there was in the rapid panorama of the picturesque personalities of the Pre-Socratic philosophers and sophists .

		Two introductory chapters interpret the spirit and temper of the age as revealed in the Athenian drtimatists , and in the constitution and ideals of the democratic empire of
Athens	LOCATION	.

		In the third chapter we pass to the Life and Work of
Socrates	LOCATION	.

		Professor
Gomperz	PERSON	's for - mula for ' this prodigious historical phenome - non ' is that he was ' a heart of mighty power working with all its force to keep the head above it cool , as a steam engine may give motion to a refrigerating machine . '

		So
Emer	PERSON	- son says of
Plato	ORGANIZATION	, * Nothing can be colder than his head , when the lightnings of his imagi - nation are playing in the sky . '

		These images point to the eternal fascination of the unex - ampled union in Plato and the Platonic So - crates of intellectual clarity with emotional depth and mystic fervor .

		There is not a trace of this quality in the Xenophontic So - crates , nor in the brief matter-of-fact allusions of Aristotle .

		We infer what
Socrates	PERSON	must have been from his supreme disciple , and we can not bring ourselves to think or speak of him except in the phrases of .

		those four books of the Platonic gospel , the Gorgias , the Apol - ogy , the Crito , and the
Phsedo	LOCATION	.

		Professor
Gomperz	PERSON	is aware of all this .

		He knows , to quote
Emerson	PERSON	once more , that '
Socrates	PERSON	and
Plato	PERSON	are the double star which the most pow - erful instruments will not entirely separate . '

New York	LOCATION	:
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		He knows that
Xenophon	PERSON	, writing years after the death of the master , puts into his mouth his own favorite moral commonplaces and ob - servations of oriental travel ; and that the un - impeachable testimony of Aristotle is confined to a few points , such as the method of in - duction and definition , and the principle that to know the right is to will it .

		In the divin - atory edification of a special Socratic philo - sophy , he is far more sober than
Zeller	PERSON	, not to speak of the fantastic h \ ^ theses of
Joel	PERSON	's * real and
Xenophontic Socrates	PERSON	. '

		It would therefore be hypercritical to insist that the necessity of saying something interesting has led even Professor Gomperz to affirm more than we know .

		Let us rather , whatever our sceptical reservations , accept with thanks his illuminating discussion of such topics as the Socratic method ; the true psychological sig - nificance of the faith that no man errs volun - tarily ; the doctrine , perhaps more Platonic than Socratic , that virtue is inseparable from happiness ; the application of the utilitarian test to ethical and political laws ; the extent of Socrates ' religious faith or scepticism ; and the nature of the famous daemonion or inward monitor .

		The brilliant chapter on
Socrates	PERSON	' end is a notable illustration of Professor
Gomperz	PERSON	's purposed if not forced picturesqueness .

		An aged Athenian , who has unexpectedly met a foreign friend in the market-place , is made the dramatic mouthpiece of the sentiments of the dicasts who cast into the urn the coimters ` with a thick axle through them , ' The aged Athenian discourses most racily in tags of Aristophanes and
Plato	ORGANIZATION	.

		.

		His pregnant gar - rulity recalls the style of the eloquent barber
Nello	PERSON	, in ` Romola , ' whose speeches
George Eliot	PERSON	enriched with the contents of her
Floren	PERSON	- tine notebooks .

		And it is perhaps captious to observe that he quotes a sentence from the ' Republic ' of Plato written some thirty years later .

		When a German specialist sets out to be popular he makes not only culture but rhetoric * hum . '

		On that fine
Spring	DATE
morning	TIME	-LRB- of the trial -RRB- in the year 399 B. C. , we are told : ' The dewdrops glittered brightly as on other days in the cups of the Anemones ; the violets shed their wonted fragrance . '

		The trial scene itself reminds us of
Macaulajr	ORGANIZATION	's
Warren Hastings	PERSON	: ' There might be seen the massive brow of Plato , -- ^ the elegant and fash - ionable Aristippus can hardly have been ab - sent or Antisthenes his resolute face framed in shaggy hair ! '

		Excellent in its way , this is the Corinthian rather than the Attic maimer ; Plato can be eloquent on occasion ; but this is how he conveys plain matter-of-fact : * Of native Athenians there were , besides Apollo - 32 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, dorus ,
Critobulus	PERSON	and his father Crito , Her - mogenes ,
Epigenes	LOCATION	,
Aeschines	LOCATION	,
Antisthenes	LOCATION	; likewise Ctesippus of the deme of
Paeania	LOCATION	, Menexenus , and some others ;
Plato	ORGANIZATION	, if I am not mistaken was ill . '

		But despite the naivete of the rhetoric , the chapter on the whole is the most vivid and entertaining presentment of the subject with which I am acquainted .

		The analysis of the Platonic ' Apology ' is subtle and discriminat - ing , and the balance of a sympathetic and im - partial historic criticism is applied to the tragic antithesis of
Socrates	PERSON	' fidelity to his ideal mission and the conservative instincts of the Athenian dicasts .

		The larger part of these volumes is natur - ally devoted to
Plato	ORGANIZATION	.

		Professor
Gomperz	PERSON	wisely recognizes in his preface that ' the ex - traction of a Platonic system from the philos - opher 's writings was an impossible task . '

		Ac - cordingly , after the usual introductory chap - ters on
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's life , works , and dialectical method , he gives us , in place of
Zeller	ORGANIZATION	's system - atic exposition , a free analysis and interpre - tation of the chief dialogues in the order of their probable composition , and , as he believes , of the development of
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's thought .

		The analyses are of necessity less detailed and searching than those already accessible to English readers in the works of
Grote	ORGANIZATION	and
Jowett	PERSON	.

		But unlike these they are unified by a definite conception of the progressive evolu - tion and the phases of the Platonic philosophy .

		Professor
Gomperz	PERSON	assumes that such an evo - lution is a priori probable , and that it has been in fact demonstrated by the special re - searches of the past twenty years .

		I have re - cently sustained the contrary thesis .

		Stated in these general terms , the question is a logom - achy .

		But to be more specific , it is quite con - ceivable that
Plato	PERSON	's extant works were written after he had reached the age of thirty or thirty-five , and his thought had assumed as definitive a form as had that of
Schopenhauer	PERSON	or
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	at a like age .

		And if this is the case , it is also conceivable that the ' contradictions ' which modem critics dis - cover in the dialogues are due quite as often to their own wistfulness as to
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's ' incon - .

		stancy . '

		At any rate , it is a pretty question for debate .

		There is a general agreement that the minor dramatic pictures of Socratic con - versations with Athenian youths are as a whole early , and that the abstruse and severe Sophist , Statesman , and Philebus are proved by their style to form a later group with the Timaeus and the Laws .

		The debate has turned mainly -LRB- 1 -RRB- on the relative dates of the Ee - public and the other great dialogues of
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's maturity ; and -LRB- 2 -RRB- on the extent to which the ' earlier ' dialogues display real and not merely dramatic immaturity of thought , or the ' lat - est ' group of dialogues modify the doctrine of the Eepublic the Symposium or the Pha3do .

		The minor dialogues together with the Pro- tagoras are discussed under the heading ' Plato as an investigator of ethical concepts . '

		In these works of
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's ' Socratic period , ' Professor
Gomperz	PERSON	finds no trace of the doctrine of metaphysical ideas or of Orphic and
Pythag	PERSON	- orean influence .

		He judiciously admits that many of the apparent fallacies and failures to conclude are merely dramatic .

		But he no - where fairly meets the main argument for
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's comparative maturity of thought even in these dramatic studies , namely the fact that the grasp of the subject exhibited in
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's subtle and systematic canvassing of antithetic points of view is inexplicable on the hypothesis that he is merely fumbling and feeling his way .

		The arguments and the dramatic movement of the Protagoras and Gorgias are excellently set forth .

		The myth attributed to ProtagxDras is aptly characterized as a ' species of caricature common to
Plato	ORGANIZATION	and Aristophanes which rivals or outbids the burlesqued author in his own peculiar excellences . '

		The Gorgias is assumed to be a reply to the attack of the sophist Polycrates upon the memor -RCB- ' of So - crates , and
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's embittered mood is explained by the vogue of that diatribe and the triumph of the party of Anytus under the leadership of the demagogue Agyrrhius .

		In his treat - ment of the main problem -- the apparent con - tradiction between the utilitarian hedonism of the Protagoras and the eloquent denunciation of the ' apolaustic ' life in the Gorgias , -- Pro- fessor
Gomperz	PERSON	is misled by his determination to find ' development ' in
Plato	LOCATION	, and by his assumption that
Plato	PERSON	failed to perceive flaws in logic that are obvious to the modem school - boy .

		Many facts are known to us which
Plato	ORGANIZATION	could not know .

		But the first lesson for the interpreter to learn is that he only makes a spectacle of himself to Gods and men by apologizing for the ' immature logic ' of the subtlest and most consistent dialectician in literature .

		However divergent in mood and dramatic suggestion , the
Gorgias	PERSON	does not , strictly speaking , contradict the Protagoras and Philebus .

		The sophistical refutation of the sophistical thesis that pleasure is unquali - fiedly the good is merely the starting point of an eloquent denunciation of the JEsthetic politi - cal and social ideals of the relaxed and pleas - ure loving democracy that had put Socrates to death and was now drifting towards the ship - wreck of
Chseronea	LOCATION	.

		There is no direct re - futation of the utilitarian doctrine that * the
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 33 good ' might conceivably be calculated as the preponderance of pleasure over pain achieved by the eschewing of unwholesome or ' bad ' pleasures .

		But the hedonistic calculus drily described in the Protagoras is repugnant to
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's feelings as it is to those of all moral - ists who care as much for edification as for analysis .

		He thought that there were better ways of expressing whatever truth may be con - tained in Epicurus 's affirmation that the belly is the seat of happiness .

		He would probably have found a way to qualify or paraphrase the more imposing modern generalization that all ethical impulses are in the last resort re - ducible to hunger and the reproductive in - stinct ; and he would certainly have found no relish in the Benthamite formula that the glee of the murderer is in strict logic to be set off pro ianto against the sufferings of his victim and his own dread of the gallows .

		The Re - public and the Laws accept the utilitarian calculus in a sense , but reverse the order , and proceed from virtue to happiness rather than from pleasure to good .

		To make even this thought prominent would mar the aesthetic and - moral \ mity of tone of the Gorgias .

		But that some pleasures are goods is as distinctly recognized in Gorgias 529 , as it is in the Re - public or Laws .

		Professor
Gomperz	PERSON	's account of the ' sophisms , ' by which it is proved that * pleasure is not among the number of goods , ' will therefore produce a wrong impression upon the modem reader .

		What is disproved is rather that the pleasure of the moment , ir - respective of its quality or consequences , is the good , -- a thesis which Callicles thereupon abandons with the remark that he maintained it only in jest .

		We may , if we please , cen - sure the dramatic episode as exaggerated and unfair caricature .

		It has no bearing on the qualit -RCB- ^ of
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's logic .

		The ' Idea of Good , ' Professor
Gomperz	PERSON	, like other modem interpreters , fails to understand , and dismisses with vague unmeaning phrases .

		The Idea of Good may be for theology -LRB-
Jod	PERSON	, for cosmogony the principle of teleology , and for mysticism the beatific vision .

		For ethics and politics it is a regulative , not a substan - tive , concept .

		It is the postulate that ethical theory and practice ought to be consistently deduced from and referred to some supreme religious , philosophic or scientific * sanction ; ' that all political and social reform ought to converge to a distinctly contemplated end ; that statesman must possess ideals and know how to apply them , and that no ruler of men can apprehend or make rational use of ideals unless in addition to the discipline of affairs he has received the highest education in the culture , philosophy and science of his age .

		This , as I have elsewhere shown , is the only interpretation that makes sense of the Repub - lic .

		It has the further recommendation that it is not only true to
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's meaning , but expresses an eternal truth .

		It will have to be accepted sometime .

		With Professor
Gomperz	PERSON	's treatment of the more difficult metaphysical dialogue , -- Par - menides , Theaetetus , Sophist and Statesman , -- I feel much sympathy even when I can not wholly concur .

		His point of view is essen - tially that of Mill and
Grote	PERSON	qualified by the German specialists ' acquaintance with recent investigations of Platonic chronology .

		His discussion of being and not being , the one and the many , the whole and the part , and other abstract entities that weave their metaphysical dance through these dialogues , is conducted in the terminology of the associationist psychol - ogy , and not in that neo-Hegelian jargon which the associationist repudiates not because he can not understand it and if need be talk it as
weU	ORGANIZATION	, as the inventors , but because it is inherently and often intentionally equivocaL This is a great gain for lucidity and ration - ality .

		But every method has the defects of its qualities .

		There are certain final puzzles of metaphysics -LRB- or , if you please , problems of the relation of words to ideas -RRB- which associa - tionists of the school of Mill dispose of too easily , when they do not overlook them alto - gether .

		And when they meet them in earlier writers , they assume that they arise in mere misconceptions of elementary logical and psychological principles .

		This is often the case .

		But it is emphatically not true of Plato .

		Intelligible philosophizing on ultimates has never gone beyond his analysis .

		An absolute solution -- the finis coniroversice is not reached , because no such result is possible .

		The puz - zles are , as
Plato	ORGANIZATION	says , rfn eternal malady of the faculty of discourse of reason in man ; and
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's recognition of this is precisely the mark of his superiority to the copious and ingenious Professors of Philosophy who , in the fuU light of the twentieth century , are still endeavoring to produce substantive and definitive systems of metaphysics .

		To achieve such a system was not
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's object .

		His aims , literary , polemical , satirical , were many .

		The three most prominent were -LRB- 1 -RRB- to uphold against dogmatic materialism a vague but never concretely superstitious , spir - itualistic , teleological and religious view of the world ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- to show that the doctrine of ideas or hypostatized general notions is conve - nient in logic , and is no more paradoxical in ontology than any other metaphysics that ad - mits an absolute : -LRB- 3 -RRB- to explode all absolute metaphysical formulas of the fifth and fourth 34 THE DIAL , -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, centuries B.C. that stood in the way of the rational use of language and the development of a practical working logic .

		The dialogues in which these results are reached are perhaps the greatest triumphs of the sheer reasoning faculty outside of the higher mathematics and astronomy .

		They can not be rightly inter - preted so long as we misconceive their aims , or , misconceiving them , undertake to read Plato lessons in elementary logic .

		Professor
Gomperz	PERSON	's treatment of them is lucid , read - able , and often illuminating in respect to par - ticular ideas .

		But he has no adequate grasp of their drift as a whole .

		He finds the ultimate puzzles of epistemology too simple himself , and can not credit Plato with the insight which he really possessed .

		Like
Grote	PERSON	, though in a lesser degree , he is so afraid of the misuse of the Theaetetus by modern intuitionist oppo - nents of rationalism that he can not do justice to its abiding significance as a final criticism of all possible absolute dogmatic materialistic psychologies .

		He is so determined to find a transformation of the theory of ideas in the later dialogues that he is blind to the plain fact that
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's defense of the theory , and the only possible defense of it , is that it is pref - erable to the only alternative then proposable -- a crude nominalism destructive of rational speech and logic .

		And though he is partly aware of
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's third aim , the elimination of the fallacies of the ^ age before logic , ' he is unable to apply the principle consistently to the interpretation of the Sophist and
Parme	PERSON	- nides .

		Had he done so , he would have per - ceived that the teaching of the two dialogues is the same ^ and that it is idle to speak of a progress of thought from one to the other .

		The ' fallacies ' of the Parmenides are deduced with a symmetrical exhaustiveness impossible to any writer who had not completely thought out the function of the copula and the nature of negative predication as expounded in the Sophist .

		For , as
Plato	ORGANIZATION	himself elsewhere says , conscious and consistent error is the sign of a more gracious intellectual condition than casual and unintentional blundering .

		To see * the want of logical training common to the whole age ' in the confusion of the copula * is ' with existence , and in ' certain illegitimate conversions ... errors of thought which
Plato	ORGANIZATION	shares with
Gorgias	PERSON	, ' is to shut the door on rational interpretation from the start .

		Ille - gitimate conversion is clearly explained in the
Euthyphro	LOCATION	and the
Eepublic	LOCATION	, and the law of non contradiction is illustrated with the utmost subtlety in the
Eepublic	LOCATION	.

		But apart from this it is bidding defiance to all psycho - logical probability to assume that obvious dis - tinctions were overlooked or elementary fal - lacies admitted by a writer who had the men - tal grasp to conceive , to carry in his imaginar tion , to distribute dramatically to convincing speakers , and to combine to one far seen and foregone conclusion , trains of reasoning which the most disciplined modern minds find it dif - ficult to follow and , to judge by their com - ment , impossible to remember .

		Let such critics try to write a Socratic dialogue them - selves .

		But it is perhaps unjust to censure Professor Gomperz especially for misapprehen - sions which , if I am right , are common to the majority of professional and philological students of Plato , and have hitherto been repudiated if at all only by the finer in - tuition and in the ohiter dicta of such writers as
Eenan	LOCATION	,
Pater	PERSON	and
Emerson	LOCATION	.

		It will be more fair to conclude by again emphasizing the superiority of Professor
Gomperz	PERSON	's book as what the editor of ^ The
Atlantic	LOCATION	' calls a ` readable proposition . '

		It offers not merely a cold technical enumeration of the tenets of the Greek philosophers , but a broad and rational discussion of the permanent significance of each great thought as it presents itself in his - toric sequence .

		It is thus a timely protest against that divorce of philosophy from the history of philosophy which the specialism of our age affects , but which is fatal to the in - telligent study and teaching of either .

		An Investigation of liYNCHiNG in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		* Lynch-law , as discussed in Dr.
Cutler	PERSON	's His - tory of Lynching in the
United States	LOCATION	, may be defined as the popular administration of justice without the forms of law .

		In tracing the history of this peculiar practice , the writer goes to mediaeval
Europe	LOCATION	for a beginning , but soon transfers his account to colonial
America	LOCATION	.

		A lengthy chapter is given on the origin of the terms ' lynch ' and ' lynch-law , ' from which we learn incidentally a good deal about the early history of the institution , but do not learn that the terms had any definite begin - nings .

		One chapter is devoted to the colonial and frontier period of lynching , which lasted to about
1830	DATE	, and another to the succeeding thirty years when the practice underwent a partial change and became fixed as an Ameri - can habit .

		The author thinks that lynching is peculiarly an American custom , because the people had no long-established civil institu - tions , respect for which is inherited in old • Ltnch-Law .

History of Lynching	ORGANIZATION	in the

1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE
DIAX	ORGANIZATION	, 35 countries ; but here the people made their law and their officials , and it was quite natural for them to rise in their sovereign capacity and administer justice .

		The historical sketch con - cludes with a study of lynching during the Eeconstruction period following our Civil War .

		The final chapters discuss in detail the statis - tics of lynchings in the last twenty years , the various reasons given in justification of the practice , and the remedies proposed .

		In con - nection with the statistical studies , there are numerous full-page charts illustrating graphi - cally the percentages and proportions of lynch - ings according to color , crime , sex , section , season of the year , etc. .

		It will be of interest to examine some of Dr.
Cutler	PERSON	's facts and conclusions .

		The illit - eracy of a community , he says , is not an index to the number of lynchings in that community ; in proportion to black population there are fewer summary executions in the Black Belt than in other sections of the South ; lynching for crimes against women has decreased dur - ing the last twenty years , while during the same period the illegal execution of white men has decreased and that of negroes has in - creased ; lynching is becoming more and more cruel in its methods , and is participated in by a lower class of whites than formerly .

		Dr.
Cutler	PERSON	is probably the first Xorthem writer who has sho ^ sTi an understanding of the real significance of the
Ku Klux Movement	ORGANIZATION	in the
South	LOCATION	during the Reconstruction period .

		He recognizes the immense difficulties under which the South labors as a result of the changes consequent upon emancipation and carpet-b ^ g rule , and maintains that the South has not been aided in solving its problems by ignorant and unfriendly criticism and interference from the
Xorth	LOCATION	.

		It is worthy of remark also that Dr.
Cutler	PERSON	does not describe race prejudice as due to slaver -RCB- - , but to verj ^ human instincts which are not confined to the South .

		The value of slavery in rooting out and checking bad habits is recognized .

		In justification of * popular justice , ' several reasons have been advanced , of which the most important are these : first , in a frontier coun - try , before civil institutions are organized , lynch-law is the only possible law ; second , in the South , owing to the disordered conditions during the past forty years , summary punish - ment has been necessary for the protection of women and children , and to make life and property safe .

		In the opinion of Dr.
Cutler	PERSON	, the frontier period is now past , and in the South there is no necessity for not allowing the law to take its course .

		Owing to the authors lack of acquaintance with conditions in the South , the section in which most of the illegal executions now occur , he omits to mention or fails to recognize cer - tain rather important aspects of the problem .

		For instance , he does not understand that , so far as the whites are concerned , the Black Belt is a thinly-settled frontier region , containing few whites among thousands of blacks .

		Here there is not , and for years can not be , any real government .

		Since
1865	DATE	, the negroes can be legally subjected to no special controL
Conse	ORGANIZATION	- quently , ` popular justice , ' from the white man 's point of view , will prevail .

		No consid - eration is given to the fact that uniformly the sympathy of the blacks is with the negro criminal , making detection of crime difficult .

		The peculiar notions of equality imbibed dur - ing the Reconstruction period , from
Northern	ORGANIZATION	politicians , teachers , and missionaries , are not yet eradicated , although the author thinks they are .

		It is very doubtful if , as Dr.
Cutler	PERSON	argues , lynching causes an increase of negro crime .

		There is no doubt of the evil effect on the white lynchers , but there is reason to believe that lynching does not induce a desire in other negroes to be l -RCB- - nched .

		The statistics used are from
Northern	ORGANIZATION	, and therefore un - friendly , sources , and while there is no prob - able doubt about the accuracy of the figures , so far as they go , the correctness of the classi - fication itself is very doubtful .

		If a negro is killed in the South , by plain murder or other - wise , the North calls it IjTiching .

		The word * lynch ' has come to be a synonym for * murder , ' or mistreatment of a negro .

		South as well as
North	LOCATION	, although the notion of * popular justice ' is frequently absent .

		An out - right murder in
New York	LOCATION	would be called a lynching in the South .

		And in connection with the discussion of ante-bellimi lawlessness in the South it may be said that * The Libera - tor ' and other anti-slavery organs are ques - tionable sources of information .

		Lawlessness in other parts of the country was unnoticed , and the search-light of criticism was directed upon one section ; and the habit has continued to this day .

		In the discussion of the various remedies tried or proposed for the purpose of checking the lynching habit , it is shown that the laws are not enforced which assess damages against counties where illegal executions occur , or which provide for the impeachment of officials who allow prisoners to be taken from them ; Northern agitation , as a remedy has certainly failed , if not worse than failed ; Federal legis - lation , the author believes , would only make matters worse ; the ` ultimate remedy ' is , he says , to create a strong public sentiment against the practice , and he believes that the South must solve for itself this serious prob -

		In view of the fact that lynchings sel - dom occur in illiterate communities , it is diffi - cult to see exactly how the education he sug - gests will exercise any direct influence on the situation ; and the reference to the results to be expected from the work of the widely adver - tised '
Southern Education Board	ORGANIZATION	' and ' Gen - eral
Education Board	ORGANIZATION	' shows a complete ignor - ance of actual conditions in
Southern	LOCATION	educa - tion .

		The real remedies , so far as the South is concerned , are : to strengthen the administra - tion of law in the thinly populated rural dis - tricts , and make honor and life safe there ; to reform the negro criminal class , and to make negro public opinion cease to protect criminals .

		But the shortcomings of the work , which are really very few , are not the result of bias , but rather of a lack of a familiar knowledge of social and legal conditions where lynchings are most frequent .

		A few months ago , an - other writer on the same subject tried , with very satisfactory results , the experiment of visiting several communities where lynchings had occurred .

		The book is sane , temperate in tone , moderate in statement , and judicial in conclusions .

		It is the only really valuable treatise on the subject , and is not likely to be superseded .

		Two Recent Books on the
Fak East	LOCATION	.

		* Events in the far East have been of such an engrossing character within recent years as to lead to an immense outpouring of books and monographs concerning nearly every phase of the Oriental situation .

		We have had travellers ' tales , descriptive accounts of popular life and customs , geographical and ethnological studies , and more or less ex parte accounts of political conditions .

		In the IJnited States , the manu - facture of books on the subject has been acceler - ated by our occupation of
the Philippines	LOCATION	, which has given rise to a special and already very large literature on that phase of the
East	LOCATION	- ern question .

		Mr.

		An Observer in

		By
John Bancroft Devins	PERSON	.

		Boston :
The American Tract Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		while Mr ,
Ireland	LOCATION	was still travelling in the
East	LOCATION	.

		The volume belongs to the best type of lit - terature on colonial questions .

		It is the product of one who has not only devoted much time to travel and has given personal attention to Oriental and Colonial conditions , but who has as a background the prior training and intel - ligence necessary to enable him to judge accu - rately of the matters with which he has to deal .

		There is every evidence of careful and painstak - ing study ; and the book has the unusual merit of being , on the whole , definite and precise in its statements .

		Opinions differ so widely as to the future of the Orient , and policies must be shaped in such various ways ^ according as one or the other theory of colonial development may be ac - cepted , that the fundamental question to be asked concerning the work of any author re - lates to his general point of view .

		Mr.
Ireland	LOCATION	makes no effort to obscure the broad theories by which his work has been guided .

		He is frankly an ` imperialist , ' accepting the idea that the future progress of the world must de - pend entirely upon the inhabitants of the tem - perate zones , and that these peoples must , for their own sake , control the countries and peo - ples of the tropics . '

		The central idea from which we must start , ' says the author , ' is this : that all human conditions , all human history , the whole expression of man in word and deed , are the result of the interaction of nature and man .

		, .

		.

		Apart from the work done by Europeans and Americans in the tropics , the civilization of the heat belt has remained sta - tionary for a thousand years .

		... It may be taken for granted that , in tropical colonies controlled by Europeans or Americans ,
West	LOCATION	- ern methods of government will be insisted on .

		.

		, .

		Western government can be main - tained in tropical countries only as long as white men are on the spot to keep things in line . '

		These extracts give the key-note to the whole of Mr.
Ireland	LOCATION	's discussion .

		Assuming that Western control is to be continued , he discusses conditions in the principal oriental colonies from the standpoint of one who regards eco - nomic development as the sole if not the only good .

		This economic development , too , is to be pursued primarily for the benefit of the West - ern race which happens to be in control of a given section of the
East	LOCATION	.

		Stable government , of course , even-handed justice between man and man , the improvement of the country through the construction of roads and of other public works , -- all these are to be demanded of a suit - able colonial administration .

		Where possible , it is well , too , that native ideas should be re - spected and native institutions maintained , --

		THE DIAL 37 but only in case they do not interfere with the main end in view .

		Mr.
Ireland	PERSON	's whole book is a tribute to the success of British administrators in establishing successful colonial governments based on the principles already set forth .

		Of such colonies as
Java	LOCATION	, French
Indo-China	LOCATION	, etc. , he has rela - tively little to say ; and in what he says he is inclined , with a sort of conventional British courtesy , to make the best of existing condi - tions and to give the greatest possible amount of credit to the foreign administrators who are at work there .

		The only exception to this rule , both as regards fulness of treatment and the exercise of the critical faculty , is found in what he has to say of
the Philippines	LOCATION	.

		On the whole , the author finds conditions both political and economic quite satisfactory in most of the Enghsh colonies .

		Of course , there are conspicuous exceptions and cases of bad administration .

		Mr.
Ireland	PERSON	does not hesi - tate to indicate these ; but it is very evident that in his opinion they are exceptions simply .

		In the
Philippines	LOCATION	-LRB- to which , by the way , the author devotes more space than to any other
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	colony -RRB- the conditions seem to be re - versed .

		Cases of success or of good administra - tion seem to be the exception , and errors , both political and economic , appear to be the rule .

		The discussion of
the Philippines	LOCATION	is divided into several different chapters , one of which re - hearses the familiar history of our acquisition of the islands .

		In a second chapter the author analyzes the structure of government ; in the third he reviews the economic condition of the
Philippines	LOCATION	; and in a fourth he criticises American policies as exemplified there .

		Mr.
Ireland	PERSON	finds that serious errors have been com - mitted , both in framing the government and in pursuing the economic policy which has ex - cluded Philippine goods so largely from the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The great over-organization of government in
the Philippines	LOCATION	, Mr.
Ireland	LOCATION	be - lieves , has resulted in saddling an enormous burden upon the natives , this burden really ex - ceeding in the per capita cost of administration the outlay in any other oriental colony .

		In the same connection , it appears that an almost total lack of public works , and a wholly unprece - dented defectiveness in the means of transpor - tation and communication , must be added to the sins of the American administration .

		The * share in government , ' said to have been given by us to the native population , is counted by Mr.
Ireland	PERSON	as of relatively little value .

		In the first place , he does not believe , -- as already seen , -- that the Oriental is capable of profiting by such a share ; in the second place , he shows very plainly that our methods of administra - tion have been such as to give to the Filipino only a very limited degree of participation in government .

		Neither practically nor theo - retically , therefore , has our administration jus - tified itself on the political side .

		Mr.
Ireland	LOCATION	, however , fully approves the course of the
United States	LOCATION	in occupying and holding
the Philippines	LOCATION	, for this he considers the only prac - tical solution of the problems which shaped themselves during the latter part of our war with
Spain	LOCATION	.

		As measures for the future , he earnestly recommends the free entry of
Philip	LOCATION	- pine products into the
United States	LOCATION	, the grant - ing of every encouragement to prospective in - vestors of American capital , the development of internal communication , the abolition of the
Pliilippine Commission	ORGANIZATION	and the substitution of an all-powerful governor-general , and finally the creation of a non-political * colonial office ' in
Washington	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Ireland	PERSON	's book , both as regards its theo - retical attitude and its specific recommenda - tions of future Philippine policy , is not calcu - lated to please any group of people in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		He is too severe in his criti - cisms of actual work done to please our poli - ticians ; and he is far too ' imperialistic ' to satisfy those who believe in the self-governing capacity of tropical races , or at all events in the desirability of a national policy which will leave them to do the best they can .

		While the book will probably appeal to the prejudices of no party in this country , it can not be consid - ered an impartial book , in the sense that it ad - vocates nothing .

		The author has ideas of his own , and does not scruple to bring forward in a pointed way the facts which support his ideas .

		His work is a wholesome one for Americans to read .

		It is fair to add that , while the statis - tical data given seem to be generally accurate , a few mistakes occur here and there .

		A work of entirely different character is Dr.
John Bancroft Devins	PERSON	's ` An Observer in
the Philippines	LOCATION	. '

		This is a profusely illustrated , badly-bound volume , printed on poor paper .

		It consists very largely of familiar stories and in - cident of the kind that circulate freely in
Manila	LOCATION	society , mingled with discussions of Protestant missionary work in
the Philippines	LOCATION	.

		The book is dedicated to President
Koosevelt	PERSON	, and has an introduction by Secretary
Taft	PERSON	.

		It is a volume which in all cases takes the strict official view of matters political and economic .

		The author seems to have been the guest , at least during a part of his brief two-months ' visit in the Islands , of Mr.
Taft	PERSON	, then
Gover	PERSON	- nor-General ; and he has a strong approval and admiration for everything done by that gentle - man .

		Here and there , however , odd little inci - dents seem to have temporarily troubled him .

		As the witness left the chair , he was required to sign his testimony in a language which he could not at all under - stand ; but , ' adds the author , with touching con - fidence , '' it is safe to infer that the translation given by the Judge was correct . '

		Dr.
Devins	PERSON	's book is non-discriminating and simple-minded in a high degree .

		It represents the results of a casual trip through some parts of
the Philippines	LOCATION	, made by one who either did not want , or did not understand how , to analyze the results of the policies that have been pur - sued in the archipelago .

		It is entertaining , and may well be worth reading , particularly if ex - amined in connection with Mr.

H. Parker Willis	PERSON	.

		A Ne ^ v History of

		* A new historical series , edited by Mr.
C. W. C. Oman	PERSON	, has for its purpose the presenta - tion of the history of
England	LOCATION	from the beginning to
1815	DATE	, in volumes by different authors , each of whom is supposed to be espe - cially qualified to write of the epoch assigned him .

		Mr.
Oman	PERSON	's preface indicates his beHef that cooperative history-writing of this nature is of value only when each writer takes a sufficiently extended period to obviate the danger of extreme specialization ; by which he means that the extreme specialist is apt to lose sight of the larger point of view and of the general trend of a nation 's development .

		The series will therefore , he hopes , occupy a middle ground between the one-man type , where no specialization is possible , and the encyclopsedic type , where correlation and con - tinuity are sacrificed to individual monographs .

		necessarily upon the merits of the various volumes .

		The volume now at hand , ' England Under the Stuarts , ' by Mr.
G. M. Trevelyan	PERSON	, cer - tainly fulfils Mr.
Oman	PERSON	's requirements .

		It covers the period from
1603	DATE	to
1714	DATE	, in fifteen chapters comprising some five hundred closely printed pages , has an excellent index , is sup - plied with a few good maps , and in addition to foot-note references to authorities cited in the body of the text it has a well arranged and carefully selected bibliography of works and sources particularly valuable to the student of the Stuart period .

		But all this , though a delightful innovation in the ordinary run of books produced by EngHsh writers , would count for little if the author had not shown his thorough understanding of the task set him , and accomplished his work with ability and in some portions with genius .

		It may briefly be said at once that Mr.
Trevelyan	PERSON	has presented a thoroughly adequate summary of the history of the period , -- as adequate , that is , as was possible within the limits of his pages .

		He is readable , thorough , unbiased , and scientific in his treatment .

		It is impossible in a brief review to do more than indicate a few of the important charac - teristics of the book .

		It is divided , rather too arbitrarily , into two distinct lines of treat - ment : that dealing with social , industrial , religious , and intellectual
England	LOCATION	; and that concerned with political events , although naturally in the narrative of the latter the author is forced to note occasionally and state the influence of topics more thoroughly analyzed under the flrst group .

		In chapter II. , on ' The Middle and Lower Classes , ' Mr.
Trevelyan	PERSON	notes that the economic changes of the seven - teenth century , changes that marked a prog - ress from wilderness to cultivation , resulted in an increased aesthetic sense among English - men , since the manifestations of that change were in themselves aesthetic , -- cottages and mansion houses springing up in differing styles of architecture and furnishing a pleasing vari - ety .

		This was due to the lack of frequent communications between districts , a condition that made local need determine wholly local building .

		Englishmen built then , as they do now , with what was cheapest and most endur - ing ; but then these qualities were found in the hedge-row whose place is now taken by the barbed wire fence , or in the massive oak timbered stables now perhaps built of corru - gated iron .

		City life in
England	LOCATION	receives rather more attention at the hands of Mr ,
Trevelyan	PERSON	than does the life of the agricultural community ; but his excuse for this is that the city or town

		89 or borough was in fact the very heart of the nation .

		The inhabitants were select , a result of the strict apprentice laws , by which the best of the country population was , with many restrictions , admitted to some trade and so to civic privileges .

		Surplus population found its last refuge in the country , and not in the city .

		The real life of
England	LOCATION	was indeed civic rather than national , though national consciousness and patriotism were awakening , and it was this very interest and participation in civic duties that produced the men capable of conducting the affairs of the state when king and hereditary officials were pushed aside .

		In all classes , says the author , the
Bible	LOCATION	was the one great educational factor , and its con - stant study , accompanied by individual inter - pretation , made men fit and ready to judge and decide for themselves in merely temporal affairs .

		Attention is called to the fact that the harsh Puritan Sabbath , restrictive as it was of all pleasure and games , and completely overturning previous usage , did nevertheless confer an inestimable boon on the laboring classes of modern
England	LOCATION	, in that it forbade work on that day as well as play .

		Even in the seventeenth century it gave a needed relief to an overworked population .

		Such are a few of the characteristics noted in a chapter full of facts and analysis , offering such con - cise summary , but written on the whole in a style not especially entertaining , and with a language that palls somewhat by its very sim - plicity and straightforwardness .

		But when Mr.
Trevelyan	PERSON	enters the field of historical narrative , he indulges in a more ambitious style , and with marked success .

		Chapter IX. , for illustration , on ' Parliament ,
Army	ORGANIZATION	, and
King	PERSON	, ' opens with the statement that ` The government of civilized nations , especially of
England	LOCATION	, is the government of custom , opposed alike to brute force and to reform .

		A civilized nation boasts that it rides safe above the two enemies of custom , Constraint or Necessity on the one hand , and Free Will upon the other ; it detests both the Tyrant and the Liberator .

		The most suc - cessful politicians are men of talent who hold by the common ways of thought . '

		This is followed by an analysis showing that the Commonwealth was the era of ' Free Will ' rule , which , unlike the French Ee volution , failed to establish a permanent system because it was representative of but a small minority of the nation .

		Cromwell himself foresaw and stated the futility and lack of permanence of his own rule as Protector .

		In the struggle between
Army	ORGANIZATION	and
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, after the cap - ture of the
King	LOCATION	, when trying to secure a compromise that should represent the nation , he said , ` Whatever we get by treaty will be firm and desirable , it will be conveyed to pos - terity ; that which you have taken by force , I look upon as nothing . '

		But when events forced him , as he thought , to become the despotic ruler of
England	LOCATION	, ` he could only keep repeat - ing to himself and to others that his God would not allow so great a work to perish . '

		The execution of the
King	ORGANIZATION	is depicted as a sin of democracy against itself .

		The
Army	ORGANIZATION	was essentially the source of this democracy .

		It demanded specifically , first , equality of opportunity and that ` individual merit should be the sole road to greatness ' ; second , a real universal suffrage , the demand for which was based both upon a fanciful and forced inter - pretation of earlier English history , and upon a theoretical analysis of the ` rights of man . ' '

		`` The poorest he that is in
England	LOCATION	, ''
Colonel Eainborough	PERSON	told his fellow-officers in council , ' ' hath a life to live as the greatest he .

		And there - fore , truly .

		Sir , I think it is clear that every man that is to ' live under
Government	ORGANIZATION	ought first by his own consent to put himself under that Govern - ment . '' '

		But the
Army	ORGANIZATION	failed to see that such innova - tions could come only by the consent of the whole nation , and after in vain attempting to pledge
Charles	PERSON	to concession , it struck at him in exasperation , and by condemning him to death , purelv the act of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	and not of the nation , it sounded the death-kneU of its own hopes in politics .

		` If there was any chance that the establishment of a more democratic form of government could gradually win the support of the people at large , that chance was thrown away by the execution of the King ... This at least is what appears .

		But appearances deceive many , and historians not the least .

		For history is a tangle of mysterious threads , of which the most important may be the least perceived .

		It may be that , deep beyond all consciousness , in the minds of the men who groaned with horror as the
King	ORGANIZATION	's head was held up to their pitying gaze ; deep in future years that lay beyond the Eestoration ; deep in remote lands beyond the English seas , bound for a time under heavier tyran - nies , the knowledge that subjects had sat in rude judgment on their King , man against man , speeded the slow emancipation of the mind from the shackles of custom and ancient reverence .

		What brave men have done , what patient men have endured -- this is known .

		But what either side has effected by its sufferings or its acts -- this not the endless seons shall reveal . '

		These quotations are from one chapter only , and that a short one .

		They are sufficient to show that the author is no ordinary narrative historian , but one who , by blending fact and analysis , creates a picture impressive in its outline and suggestive in its language and ideas .

		If the other five volumes of this series are in any way equal to that of Mr.
Trevelyan	PERSON	, a work of decided value and novelty will have been offered to the public .

Recent Fiction	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Translations of good foreign fiction have not been frequent of late years .

		There was a time , not so very long ago , when translators and publishers seemed unusually alert to dis - cover the best contemporary work of the Con - tinent , and to offer it to English readers .

		We were busily engaged in making the acquaint - ance of the most important P ^ uropean novelists , and our own practice of the art of fiction , in danger of growing stale , seemed to benefit greatly by the revivifying influence of these fresh currents of thought and this widening of the outlook .

		This literary condition makes all the more noticeable a translation , just published , of the most remark - able work that German fiction has produced for a long time .

		It is now three years since • ^
Jorn Uhl	PERSON	' took its native public by storm , and since then it has sold to the extent of something like a quarter of a million copies , breaking all German records .

		Such a book obviously called for translation , and it is not altogether to our credit that it has been so long kept from English readers .

		To the weary reviewer of current fiction , it comes like manna in the desert , and when we compare it with our own popular novels of like sales -- our '
Graustarks	PERSON	' and '
Eben Holdens	PERSON	' -- it inspires to melancholy reflection upon the dif - ferent levels of public taste in

		and he is just over forty years of age .

		Two earlier novels , ' Die
Landgrafin	PERSON	' and ' Die
Drei Getreuen	PERSON	, ' attracted little attention , but the success of the third has so repaid him for this earlier neglect that he has resigned his pastorate , and will henceforth devote himself to literature .

		Holsatia non cantat , says an old proverb , but the saying has been falsified by the work of
Hebbel	ORGANIZATION	,
Groth	PERSON	,
Theodor Storm	PERSON	, and
Detlev von Liliencron	PERSON	, to say nothing of the writer of genius now under consideration , who has made articulate to deeply-moving effect , the life which has its being on the moors and meadows and marshes that lie between the Eider and the
Elbe	LOCATION	. '


Jom Uhl	PERSON	' is like an oak that is deeply rooted in its native soil , whence it di ^ aws the rugged strength by which it towers above the landscape , and attracts the attention of distant observers .

		It is a rich , homely book , seemingly artless in its simple sincerity , intensely human in its ap - peal , touched with the poetic feeling that can glorify the humblest material , and genuine in the best sense of the word .

		Little need be said of the story .

		In the sense of the average reader of novels , there is no story , but only a series ; of nature-pictures , studies of racial character in a small and closely-related group , with folk-lore and philosophy interspersed .


Jom Uhl	PERSON	, sprung from a peasant stock of ancient repute , grows up to realize that the family fortunes are decaying , that the farm is going to waste , and that his father and older brothers , drunken and shiftless , are incapable of saving themselves from ruin .

		He takes up the burden thus laid upon his shoulders , and struggles manfully for many years against a fate that is inexorable .

		In this aspect , as well as in the sombreness of its atmosphere , the book is strikingly like
Herr Sudermann	PERSON	's '
Frau Sorge	PERSON	' -- the differences being such as naturally exist between Holstein and
East Prussia	LOCATION	.

		But '
Jom Uhl	PERSON	' is a richer work than that idyl of sorrow , and has more of poetic relief .

		This quality has for its defect a looseness of structure that deprives the work of unity and plan except in a very broad sense .

		Episodical matter is frequent and often only vaguely relevant .

		Even the episode of the War of 1870-71 , with its realistic description of
Gravelotte	LOCATION	, is not worked into any very intimate relation with the plot .

		Jorn simply went when he was called to arms , did his duty uncomplainingly , and returned to his farm when the campaign was over .

		But on their own account we could ill spare these scenes of camp and conflict , for they constitute a mas - terpiece of their kind .

Herr Adolf Wilbrandfs	PERSON	' Oster-Insel / a novel dating from
1894	DATE	, The English version is entitled * ' A New Humanity / and is the work of Dr.
A. S. Eappoport	PERSON	.

		This book , as students of German literature are aware , is essentially a study of the philosopher
Nietz	PERSON	- sche , the tragedy of whose life is reproduced in the guise of fiction .

		Its hero .

		Dr.
Helmut Adler	PERSON	, is inspired with a belief in the possi - bility of a new type of humanity , to be evolved under conditions of special nurture and selection upon an island in the
South Pacific	LOCATION	.

		This idea becomes first an obsession , and then a mania , and finally reduces to ir - remediable madness the powerful intellect that has conceived it .

		The story is told with a certain morbid power , but drags heavily in the telling , and is only moderately successful in the delineation of the several types of charac - ter which people its pages .

		Mr.
Quiller-Couch	PERSON	is at his happiest and best in ' Shining Ferry , ' a novel of the Corn - wall which he knows so well , and which he presents to us with so much sympathy and humor .

		The figures of the local magnate , the contemptible son who succeeds him , the new schoolmistress , and her bashful sailor-lover , are admirable studies of character , and several of the lesser figures -- Mr.
Benny	PERSON	, the confi - dential clerk ,
Nicky Vro	PERSON	, the ancient ferry - man , and Mrs. Purchase , the skipper 's better half in the literal sense , are worthy of being classed with the creations of
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is a book of which no notion whatever may be given by an outline of the plot ; its charm resides in the touches of gentle sentiment , of quaint humor , and of tender feeling with which it is enriched in every chapter .

		It is a wholesome and human book , to be read with keen delight from beginning to end .

		* Belcharaber , ' by Mr.
Howard Overing Sturgis	PERSON	-LRB- a name unknown to us -RRB- , is a strong novel made decidedly unpleasant by its theme of adulter -RCB- ' , or rather by the author 's failure to maintain a decent reticence in the handling of that theme .

		If it were not for this fault , the book would deserve high praise , for there is nothing amateurish about either style or construction , and it moves easily among the scenes and situations which it presents to us .

		It is a novel of upper-class English society , and has a most lovable and sympathetic hero , whose life from childhood up is skilfully por - trayed .

		It is such a book as we sometimes get from Mr.
Anthony Hope	PERSON	, with an added touch of seriousness quite beyond the reach of that brilliant writer .

		About thirteen years ago there was pub - lished a remarkable work of fiction entitled ' Calmire . '

		The book was anonymous , and was fiction only in a very qualified sense , be - ing primarily a discussion of the fundamental problems of religious and ethical philosophy .

		It was clearly the work of an acute thinker who was also a genial man of the world , and its brilliant yet unstilted exposition of the ab - struse matters with which it was concerned made it a highly noteworthy production .

		Writ - ing of it at the time , we called it ` a. helpful book , ' and described it as offering * a faith as far transcending that of our childhood as the wide world itself transcends the nursery . '

		Ee - markable as '
Calmire	PERSON	' was , it seems to have made little impression upon the public , and , aside from the reviews which it received as a perfunctory matter of course , it got nothing like the attention it deserved .

		Dur - ing the years that have elapsed since its ap - pearance , we do not recall having met with any person who has read it , or having seen it mentioned anywhere in print .

		We now have from the same hand a second work , entitled ' Sturmsee , ' which introduces many of the earlier characters , but this time engages them in the discussion of social and political themes .

		The two works are now seen to be mutually complementarj ' , and to embody a singularly ijipe and balanced conception of ` the whole duty of man , ' as seen in the light of the evolu - tionary ' philosophy .

		The author , in fact , con - fesses to this purpose in his preface to the new volume , to which he gives the sub-title * Man and Man , ' as contrasted with the * Man and
Nature	ORGANIZATION	, ' which he now suggests for the earlier work .

		We have , we trust , said enough to warn off from this book the seeker after mere entertainment , and to attract to it those readers of serious intent for whom alone it is designed .

		It is not entirely without interest as a story , but it is essentially a book of dis - cussions to which a conversational and pic - turesque form of exposition gives point and animation .

		The subjects range over the field suggested by such phrases as the labor prob - lem , cooperation , socialism , anarchism , social settlements , monopolies , and the significance of democracy .

		This random list gives only the capital headings , without conveying any notion of the ramifications and special appli - cations which the exigencies of the story de - mand .

		For , we repeat , there is a story , albeit a thin one and of disjointed structure .

		There are also characters , fairly well-defined and interesting , instead of the mere pegs for opin - ions which our description might lead the reader to expect .

		There are even incidents as exciting as a labor riot and an anarchistic at - tempt at assassination , besides some really 42 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
July 16	DATE	, charming love-making , and no end of delicious banter and conversational by-play .

		We must describe the author -LRB- whoever he may be -RRB- as a good American , by which we mean a man who believes from the bottom of his heart in the great democratic experiment which we are working out upon this continent , yet who makes no concessions to the clamor of the vul - gar or bombastic spokesmen of democracy , who is even readier to voice a caustic condemnation of our national faults than to pen the praises of our virtues , and who does not hesitate to find many examples worthy of our emulation in the ' eifete ' societies of the European world .

		Two brief extracts may close this review .

		Calmire , speaking of philanthropic effort in general , says : ' The devotion of the able man 's surplus must be voluntary , to be effective .

		To compel it by taxation , or in any other way , has all the faults of robbery , including dis - couraging the production of any surplus . '

		It would be difficult to pack more wisdom than this within the same compass of words .

		It is also Calmire who thus sums up the moral of the whole argument : ' If there 's a purpose in this universe -LRB- I do n't say that there is or is n't , partly , perhaps , because I hate to apply the phraseology made for our tuppenny minds to the immeasurable processes going on behind all they can take note of -RRB- -- if there 's a pur - pose , or a plan , nothing seems to me plainer than that it 's part of that plan , to evolve hap - piness through intelligence and morality , and primitive intelligence and morality through struggle , but to evolve the higher morality through the opposite of struggle -- through the care of the weak by the strong , and the recip - rocation of the weak to the strong -- sympathy and generosity on one side , fidelity and grati - tude on the other , until all are strong . '

		There is no sentimentalism about this book , which exposes with keen and merciless logic the weakness of the various socialistic panaceas of which in these days we hear so much ; but there is social sympathy of the broadest kind , which is a much better quality .

		We confess to no little curiosity concerning the authorship of this wise and helpful work .

		Turning from ' Sturmsee , ' with its abstract discussion of the labor problem , we find in Mr.
Scott	PERSON	's ` The W ^ alking Delegate ' a dis - tinctly concrete treatment of the same subject .

		Here we have a work which is fairly brutal in its realism , a vivid and vigorous transcript of life in the labor world of a great city , a book written without any pretence of style , yet crudely impressive by virtue of its picturesque speech and its close acquaintance with the con - ditions depicted .

		It is a study of the * labor leader ' and his methods -- as illustrated by a Parks or a Shea -- and unsparingly exposes the corrupt and criminal practices whereby a strong and unscrupulous bully becomes the master of his union and maintains the terror - ism of his rule .

		His exposure and disgrace are finally brought about by the persistent efforts of the honest workingman who opposes him , and virtue is triumphant in the end .

		The book is quite as scathing in its treatment of the corrupt methods of the employer as in its implied denunciation of trade union meth - ods , and thus holds a fairly even scale be - tween the two parties to the struggle .

		It is a veritable sink of iniquity that is here uncov - ered for our gaze , but the whole story is made only too sadly credible by the actual occur - rences with which our newspapers make us familiar from day to day .

		Two American novels of the Reconstruction period , now before us , while very different in their methods , are alike in their close study of the perplexing conditions of the years imme - diately following the Civil War .

		One of them , ' The Lion 's Skin , ' is the work of Mr.
John S. Wise	PERSON	, who has played an important part in the recent political history of
Virginia	LOCATION	, and who is the son of the war governor of that
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		In this book there is far more history than fiction ; in fact , the author seems to have adopted the form of the novel chiefly as the means of attracting a wider circle of readers than might otherwise have been secured for what is essentially a volume of personal reminiscences and a running com - mentary upon the political history of his native Commonwealth .

		There is much con - tentious matter in this book , and the author adopts many positions that will be questioned , particularly in his defence of
Mahone	PERSON	and the policy of the ' readjusters . '

		He laments the decline of political morality that has charac - terized
Virginia	LOCATION	of recent years , and is no less unsparing in his denunciation of corrupt modern tendencies than in his scathing ac - count of the carpet-baggers ' regime .

		Of the popular historical novelists who have dealt with this region and period he seems to have but a poor opinion , but if they might profit - ably learn from him as to matters of fact , he , in turn , might well take lessons from them in the art of fiction .

		Our other novel of Eeconstruction days is the work of Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	, and the scene is
Missouri	LOCATION	.

		Here the admixture of history is slight , merely enough to provide the story with atmosphere and the tragedy with an ade - quate motive .

		Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	's concern is pri - marily artistic , as we hardly need to state , and his artistic success , in the present in - stance , is marked and complete . '

		THE DIAJL 43 Trescot ' is a novel which is given more than ordinary distinction by the conscientiousness of its endeavor , the sincerity of its workman - ship , and its high human interest .

		Xot only is the general plan of the work praiseworthy , but the details are worked out with lo \ ` ing skill , and the lesser characters and situations are never scamped for the sake of those of greater significance .

		The story is briefly as follows :
George Trescot	PERSON	is a young lawyer of
Boston	LOCATION	who marries the daughter of a whim - sic-al and opinionated capitalist .

		His father - in-law has large propert -RCB- - interests in a South - ern town on the
Mississippi	LOCATION	and thither Tres - cot is sent to act as agent , and disentangle a network of legal complications .

		His position is a difficult one , for not only is sectional feel - ing rife in the community to which he goes , but he labors under the additional disadvan - tage of coming as a stranger to attack squatter claims .

		Both he and his wife meet this situa - tion with peculiar tact , and their conciliatory measures do much to soften the asperities of the legal struggle .

		But the opposing counsel , finding himself practically defeated , and em - bittered by the blow thus dealt to his personal interests , revenges himself by shooting Trescot upon a purely imaginary pretext of self-de - fence .

		From this point on , the interest is con - centrated upon the assassin and the widow of his victim .

		The former , acquitted by the courts , is made the object of a relentless cam - paign conducted by the injured woman , a campaign of vindictiveness untempered by any touch of mercy or compassion .

		She employs every agency within her reach , and inflicts upon him such moral tortures that he is driven in desperation to end his own life .

		It is not a pleasant story , but it is a strong one , and it deepens in tragic intensity until the reader is held breathless in its grasp .

		It is a great triumph , thus out of commonplace materials , and by the use of strictly legitimate methods , to produce a work of such singular power , and Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	deserves the warmest congratulations upon his success .

		Mr. An - characters .

		^ ^ ^ ^
MacPhail	ORGANIZATION	has produced an uncommonly readable and instructive book .

		He has a vein of quaint humor which helps him to treat such confessedly dry subjects as
Cal	LOCATION	- vinism and the writings of
Jonathan Edwards	PERSON	in a manner which makes them not unattractive to the readers of to-day .

		He is able in the same sentence to give us a flash of truth and to make us smile at his novel and clever way of putting it .

		If he sometimes arouses our suspicion that he is overdoing the business of being novel and clever , let us not be too hard on him , but remem - ber what he is trying to do : to interest his au - dience -LRB- originally a company of artists -RRB- in a subject not only dry but to them actually dis - agreeable ; to show them something of the work which Puritanism has accomplished in the world , and of the relationship of Puritanism to the spirit of beauty .

		The author is not blind to the shortcomings of the Puritan , -- his narrow and painfully limited views of life ; his dogmatic ar - rogance regarding knowledge of the hereafter , especially of hell ; his comic misplacing of energy -LRB- as when
Jonathan Edwards	PERSON	became a missionary to the Indians -RRB- .

		Yet as we read these pages we can not help feeling the essential sublimity of the Puritan struggle after perfection , and the real greatness -- even though it lacked proportion -- of the Puritan character .


Jonathan Edwards	PERSON	awakened the people of
New England	LOCATION	and spread views that bore fruit in the great humanitarian movement .

		The rule of
John Winthrop	PERSON	, even though he failed to hold church and state to - gether , is full of significance to those who long for civic and civil righteousness .

		The real
Margaret Fuller	PERSON	was not an absurd creature , but a heroic Puritan woman , who made mistakes but nevertheless exhibited admirable traits , and was the victim as much of friends as of enemies .

		Walt Whitman shows us that the Puritan is sometimes the radical rising in primitive sim - plicity and breaking down the barriers of false and absurd conventionality .

		Through the great revival begun by
John Wesley	PERSON	, the spirit of re - ligion , which was the essence of Puritanism , was quickened and deepened .

		All these , then , are '' gnificant characters , whose lives help us to understand the various phases and stages of the Puritan movement .

		The reader of Mr.
Mac	PERSON	-
Phail	PERSON	's volume will be rewarded with new light , and of some matters he will perhaps get a new point of view .

		Misa Coreiii Some recent periodical contribu - apeakaher tions by Miss Marie CoreUi have *** ' ^ been issued in book form under the title , ` Free Opinions Freely Expressed ' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- .

		The disputatious , not to say censorious , tone of these essays moves the reviewer to re - mind the writer that people are seldom to be argued or scolded into wisdom .

		Direct assaults on foUy too often produce an effect contrary to the one intended .

		Miss
Corelli	ORGANIZATION	's dispraise of yellow journalism , and the incidental display of her own familiarity with the odious thing , will hardly diminish by one copy the sale of any yel - low journal .

		Why not turn one 's back on the wretched stuff and let one 's silent influence ef - fect what it may ?

		More than once the author indulges in censure of ` the free-library craze , ' ajid of its chief promoter , Mr.
Andrew Carnegie	PERSON	.

		` To borrow one 's mental fare from Free Li - braries , ' she declares , ` is a dirty habit , to begin with ' ; and other reasons follow why we should shun the public library .

		The best she can say of free libraries is that they are ` undoubtedly verj - useful resorts for betting men .

		They can 44 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, run in , glance at the newspapers for the latest '' Sporting Items , '' and run out again .

		But why ratepayers should support such houses of call for these gentry remains a mystery ' to
Miss Corelli	LOCATION	.

		Her animus is explained later , when she laments the injury done to popular authors by free li - braries , whose circulation of a dozen copies of the latest novel pj-events its purchase by hun - dreds of readers .

		In this connection may be noted her chapter on ' A Question of Faith , ' wherein she declares herself a Christian ; asserts that a consistent Christian must believe in the virtue of poverty , the dignity of labor , and the excellence of simplicity ; and urges her readers to be consistent .

		Why , then , this grudge against Mr.
Cai-negie	PERSON	and his libraries , if they are help - ing her to a more vivid realization of the virtue of poverty and the dignity of labor ?

		Seriously , she should know that whatever harm free li - braries may do to popular authors -LRB- a harm , by the way , that it might be difficult to prove -RRB- is more than balanced by the good they do to stu - dents , whose researches would often be impos - sible without the collections of books now avail - able in all our larger cities .

		Of Americans ,
Miss Corelli	ORGANIZATION	says some harsh things that may make one wish her better acquainted with us .

		Her chapter on ' A Vital Point of Education ' de - plores the general ignorance of how to read .

		She thinks that ` Americans , even more than the British , require to be taught ' this art .

		An ex - pression used by her a little later suggests the equal desirability of learning how to write .

		Re - ferring to two classes of persons , she speaks of the one forming ` the larger majority . '

		What , one queries , would a ` smaller majority ' be ?

		Miss
Corelli	ORGANIZATION	's admirers -- and their name , largely per - haps owing to public libraries , is legion -- will en - joy these twenty-seven essays , which have the merit of brevity and at times of sprightliness .

		The seventh volume of the ` Moderii o/roSf `` English Writers ' series -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , on
Browning	PERSON	, is written by Professor
Charles H. Herford	PERSON	of
the University of Manchester	ORGANIZATION	.

		The commen - tator knows his
Browning	PERSON	well , has availed him - self of the best and latest authorities , and mani - fests a considerable degree of sympathetic appre - ciation ; but he is hampered in his presentation by a clumsiness of expression which recalls the story of the plain man who reported his entire understanding of
Bunyan	PERSON	's ` Pilgrim 's Progress ' and his hope that in time he might be able to master the explanatoi * y notes .

		We get on with him passably well , however , through Part I. , on
Browning	PERSON	's Life and Work ; but in
Part II.	LOCATION	, on his Mind and Art , he out-Brownings
Browning	PERSON	in his use of unusual words , and in tangled , in - volved and obscure phrases .

		Whether or not we understand
Browning	PERSON	's doctrine of love , surely we can not be much helped by being told that ` It started up in corrupt or sordid hearts and swept all their blind velleities into its purifying flame of passion , ' and what are we to understand by such phrases as ` eager , articulating concrete sen - sibility , ' ` visual speech of sharply cut angles and saliences , ' ` nodosities of character , ' etc. ?

		Even in his preface the author can make known his purpose only in such blind and inconclusive fashion as this : ` This book may perhaps be de - scribed as an attempt to work out , in the detail of
Browning	PERSON	's life and poetry , from a more definitely literary standpoint and without
Hege	PERSON	- lian prepossessions , a view of his genius not un - like that set forth with so much eloquence and Ijenetration , in his well-known volume , by Pro- fessor
Henry Jones	PERSON	. '

		Is Professor
Herford	PERSON	aware that
America	LOCATION	has furnished almost the first and still some of the most enthusiastic in - terpreters of
Browning	PERSON	, when he says -LRB- p. 4 -RRB- that , except in
Italy	LOCATION	, `
Browning	PERSON	is all but non-existent for the rest of the civilized world beyond the Channel ? '

		Numerous misquotations frorn the poems , in a case where the smallest inaccuracy is unpardonable , do not strengthen our confidence in Professor
Herford	PERSON	or his book .

		However , it no doubt has its value , and its groupings of poems and generalizations regarding
Browning	PERSON	's standpoint and mission are , to say the least , sug - gestive , One of the great obstacles en - foniai ` histTr ` y. countered by students of
Southern Colonial	ORGANIZATION	history has been the lack of accessible and trustworthy sources of infor - mation .

		While the
Northern States	LOCATION	, and notably those of
New England	LOCATION	, have for many years been doing everything in their power to facilitate the work of historians in the field of Colonial history , the
Southern States	LOCATION	, on the other hand , have been exceedingly backward in this work , and students have had the greatest difficulty in uncovering their Colonial records .

		This per - haps accounts in a measure for the misstatements that have crept into current writing regard - ing the Colonial history and activities of the
Southern States	LOCATION	.

		Notably is this the case with
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		No State in the
Union	ORGANIZATION	has perhaps more complete , full , and well-preserved Colonial records ; but these documents have for many years been buried away beyond the reach of the most zealous investigator .

		With the adoption of the new constitution of
Virginia	LOCATION	, provision was made for the proper care and preservation of these documents , which had suffered much from neglect and vandalism .

		For two years past , a trained library force has been engaged in classi - fying and arranging these records .

		The recent publication , by the
Library Board	ORGANIZATION	at
Richmond	LOCATION	, of the Journals of the
House of Burgesses of Virginia	ORGANIZATION	for the years 1773-1776 , will be wel - comed by students throughout the country .

		No period of
the State	ORGANIZATION	's history is richer in sug - gestion or more valuable in its relation to the history of the country than the few years im - mediately preceding the Revolution .

		With an unpopular Governor and a somewhat verbose
House of Burgesses	ORGANIZATION	, frequent quarrels took place within the
State	ORGANIZATION	during this time .

		Some of these were of small importance , but everj - one drew from the Burgesses an indignant protest against what they held to be an assumption of power by the Governor .

		The work of editing the volume has been ably done by Mr.
John Pendleton Kennedy	PERSON	, the State Li - brarian of
Virginia	LOCATION	, who has added a valuable introduction containing numerous extracts from contemporary newspapers and unpublished ` Broadsides . '

		The letters and minutes of the
Colonial Committee of Correspondence	ORGANIZATION	are ap - pended to the Journal of each year , and add much to the value of the work .

		It is to be hoped that Mr.
Kennedy	PERSON	's anouncement that the entire series of
Burgess Journals	ORGANIZATION	will be printed is to be carried into effect , and that he will also be able to comply with the request of students to print the valuable collections of transcripts in the Library from the British Museum and Brit - ish Records office Few and fit will be the readers at - u ^ lV ^ aV !

		Mr.

		A dangerously comfortable income ' and a ready yielding to the claims of society are partly responsible for this .

		These deal principally with poetry , or books about poetry , and go somewhat minutely into matters of style and even into verbal criticism .

		Two longer essays , on the

Leigh Hunt	PERSON	as a poet , are re - printed from the `
National Review	ORGANIZATION	' and the ` Fortnightly ' respectively .

		Twenty-five short poems from Mr.
Kent	PERSON	's i > en are scattered through the book .

		Excellent in its way , and characteris - tic , is the discussion of ` The Pains of Rhyme , ' deploring the staleness of most of our available rhjTnes .

		Painters may ` repeatedly and trium - phantly surmount the difficulties of their art , ' but ` the man has yet to be bom who can make repeated and triumphant rhymes to `` moon . ''

		* In the matter of verse-making , the author elsewhere pours out his scorn on the time-honored practice of inversion to suit the exigencies of metre and rhjTne , as
Wbrdsworth	ORGANIZATION	's , ` My name is

		Resorting once more to the ` tu quoque , ' the reviewer would ask him to de - fend this couplet from his ` Springtime , ' -- ' Sudden and loud through larch and fir Rings the laugh of the woodpecker . '

		To say nothing of the borrowing here from
Mallock	ORGANIZATION	's line , ` The long loose laugh of the wild woodj > eeker , ' who is not reminded of the dog - gerel , ` Punch , brothers , punch , ' with its absurd stress on the last syllable of ` passenger ' ?

		Mf .

		Kent 's sonnet on
Lord Beacoustield	LOCATION	has this limping line , ` How scathlessly from out the fury and foam . '

		Just after animadverting on the split infinitive , we find the critic guilty of ` no less than four new editions , ' a ' use of less for fewer which he soon afterward repeats .

		These are trifles light as air , but polish brings out even minute flaws , and in treating a writer who pays such attention to the small pjoints of style , and who incidentally sneers at ` the shallower sort of American scholars , ' an American reviewer feels justified in pointing out minute defects .

		Mr.
Kent	PERSON	's ' Schraden-f reude ' for ` Schadenfreude ' is another small error , for which , after all , perhaps the long-suffering printer will consent to bear the blame .


Oregon Trail	ORGANIZATION	, The centennial of the
Lewis	PERSON	and and life in the
Clark	PERSON	Expedition has drawn public ttev -RRB- country , attention to our great
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	country , reviving our interest in its history and in its wonderful natural resources .

		A glimpse of the life of the early immigrants during the toilsome march across the plains and through the mountains and deserts , and of the social condi - tions in the new land , is afforded by Mrs.
Abigail Scott Duniway	PERSON	's ` From the West to the West ' -LRB- McCluj ^ -RRB- .

		The tale is apparently founded up < Mi a journal kept by a young girl who was a member of an overland party in the early fifties , and por - trays in a realistic fashion the hardships and perils and dilemmas which beset the path of the pioneers .

		Into this story of adventure is woven a series of romances which give the author an opportunity to exploit her ideas on such diverse themes as the property rights of wives , woman suffrage , and thought-transference .

		The book affords an interesting though somewhat idealized picture of the early days , but makes no preten - sions to historical or geographical accuracy , -- as witness the arrival of the hero at
San Francisco	LOCATION	from
Astoria	LOCATION	after ' four days of languorous idle - ness on a glassy sea -LCB- sicf -RRB- .

		with * lights of the Farallones to the leeward , while on their left rose
Mare Island	LOCATION	; and they knew that they were neariug the Golden Gate . '

		-- In the ` Letters from an
Oregon Ranch	ORGANIZATION	, ' from the same publishers , we are given a series of pictures of the out-of-door pioneer life of to-day in that romantic region .

		Surely no ` native son ' could be more genuinely enthusiastic over the beauties and possibilities of his .

		State than is this newly adopted ` webfooter ' who has abandoned city life in the East for the trials and discomforts of the frontier .

		Nothing daunts her cheery enthusiasm ; deficiencies in equipment or supplies only make more strenuous call upon ingenuity , or give occasion for cheerful 49 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, jest ; and rain-bound isolation affords an oppor - tunity for charming details of fireside comfort .

		There are a number of attractive full-page illus - trations , which , with the author 's pleasing in - terpretations of the green and growing world about her , give an excellent idea of the verdure - clad coast regions of
Oregon	LOCATION	.

		A study of To write expertly of children re - aoth century quires such a vast fund of informa - children .

		^ j ^ ^ j ^ ^ j immediate experience that it is generally considered quite a hopeless task , readily attempted and as readily neglected .

		To write of one child , or of some children , is com - parative easy ; but children as a class or as a social factor otfer obstacles to the pens of all except such daring spirits as Mrs.
Charlotte Perkins Oilman	PERSON	, and such martyi-s to the cause as Mr.
E. H. Cooper	PERSON	.

		Even Mr.
Cooper	PERSON	, in his chai-ming book on ' The
Twentieth Century Child	ORGANIZATION	' -LRB-
John Ijane	PERSON	-RRB- , makes terms witli his subject and discusses English children , and , of those , mostly the children of the better classes .

		The value of his book lies largely in its very personal tone , in the assurance it gives that stories and inci - dents are simple reality , and therefore that Mr.
Cooper	PERSON	's theories are based on sound experience .

		These theories are well worth study , contain - ing hints r ^ arding the proper management of the child in all its relations , at play , at lessons , in sickness , in company .

		The chapter on Prayers is especially suggestive , although the premise is hardly one to be generally conceded .

		` Religious feeling , ' Mr.
Cooper	PERSON	says , ` may or may not be a matter of temperament in the case of grown - up folk ; in the nursery there is , I imagine , no emotion or lesson which can be less easily forced into the pupil 's mind . '

		In spite of an intense interest in and fondness for ' The Twentieth Cen - tury Child , ' Mr.
Cooper	PERSON	is rarely or never senti - mental about him , and writes with more than usual sense about the child 's personal responsibil - ity for the leading attributes of his character .

		` The disagreeable child ' is as important a factor in nursery life as the disagreeable man is in the life of the world , and any system of training which leaves out of account a child 's innate ten - dency toward the disagreeable is boimd to be mi - fair to the child who most requires system .

		Mr.
Cooper	PERSON	supplements his theoretical writings with stories by children , and with others about chil - dren , that lend attractiveness to his book .

		Cranmerand The dignified and weighty series of the English moderate-sized biographies of the Reformation .

		^ Heroes of the
Nations	ORGANIZATION	' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is continued by Mr.
Albert Frederick Pol	PERSON	- lard 's `
Thomas Cranmer	PERSON	and the English Re - formation , ' 1489-1556 .

		The author writes with the authority of a professor of constitutional history in
University College	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	, and of previously successful authorship upon the history of this complex period .

		After a chapter on
Cranmer	PERSON	's early life , the story begins with the divorce of
Catharine of Aragon	ORGANIZATION	, with special reference to
Cranmer	PERSON	's part in bringing it about .

		Succeeding chapters discuss the Royal Suprem - acy , the various steps in the reform m.ovement under
Henry VIII	PERSON	.

		and
Edward	PERSON	, the
Catholic Reaction	ORGANIZATION	, the Books of Common Prayer , and his martyi ` dom under
Queen Mary	ORGANIZATION	.

		The character and ability of
Cranmer	PERSON	are skilfully portrayed , and the work may be counted as a real contri - bution to popular knowledge on this important period .

		TAventy portraits embellish the volume and add to its value .

		** The guiding idea of tlie present WOrIc is to view the subject as the record of an evolution , and to trace the growth of the nation from the standpoint of that which preceded , rather than from that which followed , '' quotes The Nation from Dr.
Channing	PERSON	's Preface , and continues : * ' The satisfactory realization of these two principles constitutes the distinguishing char - acteristic of the first volume ... The most enduring impression which Professor Chan - ning 's work leaves upon the mind in respect of scholarship is , indeed , the sense of mastery .

		... The narration moves easily along , without haste and without rest , devoid of ornament , but not without its quiet humor at times , or now and then a biting epigram ... But to do justice to the book it is neessary to read it , and that is undoubtedly what all students of American history will do while awaiting the subsequent volumes . ''

		The
Atlantic Monthly	LOCATION	comments : * < From Professor
Channing	PERSON	's beginning it is evident that his will be a standard history .

		He writes with perfect independence after weighing all the testimony .

		He is very sober-minded , with a preference for moderate statement , and for reducing legends to their lowest terms .

		He leans to the critical rather than to the narrative side .

		As there is in
America	LOCATION	no historian more careful and thorough than he , and none more loyal to the scientific method , so it is noteworthy that he has given great attention to the literary form of his history .

		From the promise of his first volume one may predict that he will hold for years to come a position similar to that held by
Bancroft	LOCATION	in an earlier generation . '' ''

		When the well-known logic and accuracy of this writer is considered , his constructive genius , sense of pro- portion , and vivid feeling for the dramatic color and movement that of themselves make the great facts of history a thing of life , rather than a dull catalogfue of causes and effects which it becomes in the hands of some of our established historians , the charm and the interest of such history writing can not be overestimated .

		BRIEFER MENTION 71 NOTES 71
FREDERICK DENIS ON MAURICE	PERSON	.

		Aubrey de Vere used to say that listening to
Maurice	PERSON	was like eating pea-soup with a fork .

		Professor
Jowett	PERSON	, in describing to Sir
M. E. Grant	PERSON	Duff a sermon preached by
Maurice	PERSON	be - fore the
University of Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, said , * A11 that I could make out was that today was yesterday , and this world the same as the next . '

		In one of her lively letters , Mrs.
Carlyle	PERSON	writes : * Mr.
Maurice	PERSON	we rarely see , nor do I greatly regret his absence ; for , to tell you the truth , I am never in his company without being attacked with a sort of paroxism of mental cramp !

		He keeps one always , with his wire-drawings and paradoxes , as if one were dancing on the points of one 's toes -LRB- spiritually speaking -RRB- .

		And then he will help with the kettle , and never fails to pour it all over the milk-pot and sugar basin ! '

		A letter from
Carlyle	LOCATION	himself to his mother characterizes poor
Maurice	PERSON	in much the same manner , but more emphatically , -- * one of the most entirely uninteresting men of cenius that I can meet ; ' and ' all twisted , screwed , wiredrawn , with such restless sensitiveness , the utmost ina - bility to let nature have fair play with him ; ' and again , ^ I do not remember that a word ever came from him betokening clear recognition or healthy free sympathy with anything . '

		Mar - tineau found
Maurice	PERSON	's ' Theological Essays ' ` on the whole shadowy and unimpressive .

		I hardly think , ' he continues , ' a man has any business to write till he has brought his thoughts into distincter shapes and better defined rela - tions than I find in
Maurice	LOCATION	.

		He seems to me to have a mere presentiment of thinking , a ten - tative process in the direction that never fairly succeeds in getting home . '

		Finally ,
John Stuart Mill	PERSON	maintained that ` great ingenuity and subtlety , and a wide perception of import * ^ ant and unobvious truths , served him , not for putting something better into the worthless heap of received opinions on the great subjects of thought , but for proving to his own mind that the
Church of England	ORGANIZATION	had known every - thing from the first , and that all the truths oi '' the ground of which the church and orthodoxy have been attacked -LRB- many of which he saw as clearly as any one -RRB- , are not only consistent witb the Thirty-nine Articles , but are better under - stood and expressed in these Articles than by any one who rejects them . '

		These and many more adverse criticisms , .

		54 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, amid innumerable eulogies of exactly contrary import , have been passed upon a man who ex - erted a powerful influence for good in his time , and the hundredth anniversary of whose birth now recalls him , not unwelcomely , to mind .

		It may be interesting , without attempting any originality of treatment or trying to fix anew his place `` in English literature and thought , to glance briefly back over
Maurice	PERSON	's life and recall some of the things he has said and some of the things others have said about him .

		He was born
Aug. 29 , 1805	DATE	, at
Normanstone	LOCATION	, near
Lowestoft	LOCATION	, being the fifth child of a rather re - markably philoprogenitive Unitarian minister and teacher of youth .

		The diversity of religious preference shown by the nimierous members of the
Maurice	PERSON	family , including the mother , and their epistolary method of communicating their lapses into orthodoxy to the heterodox father under whose roof they all dwelt in common , pre - sent a scene of some picturesqueness .

		Frederick himself seems early to have developed inde - pendent views in religion and never to have embraced his father 's Unitarianism , life-long dissenter though he was from the conventional Church-of-Englandism .

		Educated at Cam - Ibridge , he left the university in
1827	DATE	without ia degree , his quarrel with the Thirty-nine Arti - ecles , to which he afterward became so notably ffeeonciled , depriving him of a diploma .

		Then tfoUowed a short experience of literary life in
London	LOCATION	, where he wrote his philosophical novel , `
Eustace Conway	PERSON	, ' and where at the age of twenty-three he edited the then recently com - bined ' Athenaeum ' and ' Literary Chronicle ' -- unsuccessfully from a commercial point of view .

		Perhaps a passage from one of his edi - torials will partly explain this unsuccess .

		It certainly reveals qualities that make one regret the writer 's early abandonment of the pen for the pulpit as a profession .

		The editorial is probably unexampled in journalism .

		` It is very gratifying , ' he writes , * to think that the influence of reviewers upon society is every day becoming more and more limited .

		In nine cases out of ten it is a question of no ma - terial consequence to the public , or to any indi - vidual of it , whether the verdicts which they jgive are carelessly uttered or are the result of mature and conscientious deliberation .

		The anost perseveringly impartial and earnest critic will find that he has some power of : strengthening the foundations of his readers ' • opinions , but very little of forming those • opinions , or changing them , while the most indefatigable of the scribes of darkness - can scarcely flatter himself that he has done any single act of successful mischief , and must con - sole himself with the reflection that , in the fiilent work of lowering the tone of public feel - ing and morality , his labours have been wholly in vain . '

		Surely there was a humorist lost to literature when
Frederick Denison Maurice	PERSON	turned his face Oxfordward , took holy orders , and devoted his energies to Christian Socialism and the reformation of a wicked world .

		Earlier and still more sprightly specimens of his literary work , put forth in his ' unregenerate ' days , had already appeared in ` The Metropolitan Quar - terly Magazine , ' which he and a student friend edited and kept alive for a whole year .

		It is curious , and rather mournful , to find
Maurice	PERSON	, when long afterward he became professor of casuistry and moral philosophy at
Cambridge	LOCATION	, laying open his breast to his young hearers and publicly repenting of an extremely clever par - ody on
Bentham	PERSON	's ` Book of Fallacies ' which he had printed in that short-lived student jour - nal . '

		I ought not to have done it , ' he solemnly declares . '

		I showed , by doing it , that I was wanting in reverence for grey hairs , and for the continuous effort of a man through a long life , at the risk of pain , at the cost of pleasure , to effect what he thought good for his fellows .

		If I had not been more a victim of his theory -LSB- utilitari - anism -RSB- than he was , I should have paid greater honour to him . '

		But his ' Puritan tempera - ment , ' as
Maurice	PERSON	himself frequently called it in his letters , was bound to assert itself ; and hence the ' twisted , screwed , wiredrawn ' result , as viewed by
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is said to be extant a letter of
Maurice	PERSON	's , written at ten years of age , which prefigures , by its precocity and self-con - sciousness , this phase of the mature man .

		And so we must take him as we find him , even in - cluding his torturing of all science and phil - osophy into conformity with the Thirty-nine Articles .

		How he contrived to regard the war - fare between science and those Articles as a concord and not a disagreement , is hard to con - ceive .

		It must have been in a Neo-Platonic ecstasy ` of immediate intuition that the har - mony revealed itself to him .

		This reconcilia - tion of opposites by removing them to some region of four-dimensional mental space , baf - fles and bewilders the poor plodder who feels constrained to content himself with the possi - bilities of space of but three dimensions , and may even move him to cry out with
Isaiah	PERSON	, ` Woe unto them that call evil good , and good evil ; that put darkness for light , and light for dark - ness ; that put bitter for sweet , and sweet for bitter ! '

		As a brief illustration of
Maurice	ORGANIZATION	's surprising feats in logical gymnastics , his nim - bleness in jumping off his own shadow , take his defense of religious tests at the universities .

		By some process of reasoning for which he is per - haps indebted to
Coleridge	PERSON	, whom he so greatly reverenced , he arrived at the ' conviction that a
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 55 teacher who was not bound by any predeter - mined conditions always tied down his pupils much more rigidly than one whose conditions of teaching were fixed beforehand .

		He believed that all evidence went to show that , both his - torically and logically , an undergraduate 's sig - nature to the Thirty-nine Articles ... implied only that the pupil accepted the Articles as presenting the conditions under which he was taught .

		Hence ... he looked upon subscription as a defense of liberty . '

		Yet there were occasional incongruities in the things of orthodox theology that not even Mau - rice 's robust faith could harmonize .


Leslie Stephen	PERSON	quotes with manifest relish the closing words of one of his Old Testament lectures .

		Discussing
Jacob	PERSON	's shabby treatment of his brother
Esau	PERSON	, the lecturer , after citing the usual apologies , was forced to add : * After all , my brethren , this story illustrates the tendency of the spiritual man in all ages to be a liar and a sneak . '

		It would puzzle a mere reader of
Maurice	PERSON	's now little-read writings to explain his influence and leadership among his fellows .

		Mr.
Saints	PERSON	- bury thus places him as a writer and thinker : ' A very generous and amiable person with a deficient sense of history ,
Maurice	PERSON	in his writ - ings is a sort of elder , less gifted , and more exclusively theological
Charles Kingsley	PERSON	, on whom he exercised great and rather unfortunate influence .

		But his looseness of thought , way - ward electicism of system , and want of accurate learning , were not remedied by
Kingsley	PERSON	's splen - did pictorial faculty , his creative imagination or his brilliant style . '

		Like
Newman	PERSON	,
Maurice	PERSON	argues to a foregone conclusion .

		His pages are richly suggestive , but his train of thought is elusive .

		He was great not because of , but in spite of , his sermons and essays .

		The man was vastly more than his visible performance .

		He was a leader largely because , while worthy of a following , he cared so little for the honors of leadership , but was always so ready to encounter its .

		dangers and fatigues . '

		In more than twenty-five years , ' writes
Charles Kingsley	PERSON	, * I have known no being so utterly unselfish , so utterly humble , so utterly careless of power or influence , for the mere enjoyment -- and a terrible enjoyment it is -- of using them .

		Staunch to his own opinion only when it seemed to involve some moral principle , he was almost too ready to yield it , in all prac - tical matters , to any one whom he supposed to possess more practical knowledge than he .

		To distrust himself , to accuse himself , to confess his proneness to hard judgment , while , to the eye of those who knew him and the facts , he was exercising a splendid charity and magna - nimity ; to hold himself up as a warning of '' wasted time , '' while he was , but too literally , working himself to death , -- this was the child - like temper which made some lower spirits now and then glad to escape from their consciousness of his superiority by patronizing him ; causing in him -- for he was , as all such great men are like to be , instinct with genial humour -- a cer - tain quiet good-natured amusement . '

		Many of these lower spirits held that , as no man could possibly be so wise as
Thurlow	PERSON	looked , so none could be so good as
Maurice	PERSON	seemed ; and these were of the number of his detractors .

		That he could on occasion bravely and cheerfully suffer for his faith , his life gave abundant and con - vincing evidence .

		By publishing his * Theo - logical Essays , ' dealing with the atonement and eternal life , he lost his professorship of theology in
King 's College	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	.

		Somewhat surprising must it seem that with his genius for dissent , his independence of thought , and his unfaltering obedience to the voice of conscience , he should have entered the English Church at the age of twenty-nine , when all his training and traditions would appear to have pointed him .

		in another direction .

		This and many other matters must be puzzled out as best one can with the help of the excellent biog - raphy of the man , compiled chiefly from his letters by his son , and published twenty-one years ago in two thick volumes , -- a veritable mine of pleasant reading , along with wire draw - ings and paradoxes that are less entertaining .

		Maurice has been dead now a third of a century ; but this biography , rather than his own books , together with the abundant references to him that occur in contemporary memoirs , as well as
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's lines * To the Eev .


F. D. Maurice	PERSON	, ' will keep his memory green for years to come .

		A few of the Tennyson stanzas may fitly be quoted here : ' For , being of that honest few Who give the Fiend himself his due .

		Crocus , anemone , violet , ' Or later , pay one visit here .

		For those are few we hold as dear ; , Nor pay but one , but come for many , Many and many a happy year . '

		A short and probably familiar anecdote , in closing , will perhaps help to convince the doubters , if such there be , that his memory is well worth preserving .

		Half a century ago five

		The talk then turned upon the choice each would make if he had to choose a companion for those last hours of mortal existence , and it was proposed that each should write his choice on a slip of paper .

OXFORD	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		Will you permit one of your oldest and most faithful readers to raise a question or two as to some points in your leading article of
July 16	DATE	, -- an article certainly entitled to much attention , and in many respects admirable , but also perhaps suggestive of some criticism * ?

		It is an article making comparisons between
Englisih	ORGANIZATION	and Amer - ican universities .

		Let it be said , in advance , that I am not wholly ignorant of either class of institutions ; having been bom in the very shadow of
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	, of which my father was an officer , and having been a member of its examining board for more than half a century , and a resident in
Cambridge	LOCATION	for the greater part of my life .

		Across the ocean , I have never been a student at an English uni - versity ; but I have at four different times visited
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and
Cambridge	LOCATION	as a guest , and have had many friends and relatives among their students .

		So far as these qualifications entitle to an opinion , I should venture to assert that while some of your points are well made , you do in other direc - tions very great injustice to the American point of view .

		Take , for instance , as ' one of the slightest , your claim that ' the English student works harder at his reading during the long vacation than during term . -RSB-

		Here you wholly ignore the vast differ - ence in
summer	DATE	climates between the countries , a difference which makes it absolutely impossible for an American student to do bookwork in sum - mer to any purpose in our largest libraries , -- as those at
Washington	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, and
Cambridge	LOCATION	, -- and which actually drives him , as I know from personal experience -LRB- for I habitually work all
summer	DATE	-RRB- , to rural or seaside places , where the books he most needs are apt to be inaccessible .

		The English student , on the other hand , can work anywhere , without serious obstacles , all the year round .

		A more important difference , in looking over the points of which you and Mr.
Nixon	PERSON	com - plain , lies in the fact that the mass of students at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	are drawn from a picked social class , and not , as in
America	LOCATION	, from the community at large .

		It is hard , in view of this circumstance , to regard seriously Mr.
Nixon	PERSON	's complaint , seem - ingly endorsed by you , that these English youths , representing what are or should be cultivated families , are more familiar than the young Amer - ieansi at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	with the names of artists and musical composers .

		Is not this to confound social polish with scholastic training ?

		Surely he and you must have noticed a similar difference in American colleges between city and country boys , while yet , tried by the standard of scholarship , the country boys are quite as apt to come out ahead .

		If all this is true at home , it is as liable to be true of American students who go to
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	by the aid of an educational charity .

		I do not know exactly what the author whom you quote means by the American students being * silent partners in conversation ' where * gen - eral culture ' is concerned .

		The charge of undue silence is so new an imputation upon young Amer - icans ^ that one hardly knows whether to grieve or to rejoice over it .

		So far as general culture involves the use of a variety of languages , it has always been a source of wonder to me , on the continent of
Europe	LOCATION	, to see how our English cousins , with the immense advantage of the nar - rowness of the British channel , yet seem to speak the languages of the continent less frequently than do Americans of similar social grade .

		This was first forced upon me , some thirty years ago , by a remark of the late
Lord Houghton	PERSON	, who com - plained in my hearing that when a French visitor came to him in
London	LOCATION	, with a letter of introduc - tion , he always found it hard to get together half a dozen Englishmen who could talk with the guest in his own language .

		The same remark he makes , I think , somewhere in his ' Monologues . '

		Happen - ing to speak of this , some time since , to a
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	professor , he meditated for a moment , and then said , ` It would not take me five minutes to think of half a dozen American guests to meet , either in
Cambridge	LOCATION	or
Boston	LOCATION	, a newly-arrived French - man , German , Italian , or Spaniard , and to talk with him freely in each case in his own language .

		This seems to look much more like what you call ` an adequate equipment ' than do the points - on which you dwell .

		But there is one matter at issue far more impor - tant than any of those already mentioned , , or indeed than all of them put together .

		You da not even allude to the enormous difference which must , and indeed should , exist between English and American training , in the fact that the larger part of our children 's book-knowledge consists , , and should consist , in the history and sociology of their own country .

		Every educational institu - tion among us , from primary school to university , , must needs put these branches first and all else later , even as
Hans Andersen	PERSON	's motherly hen found it her duty to teach her chickens the geography of their own barnyard , and after scratching it up thoroughly , to look through a knot-hole in the neighbor 's fence and see how large the world was .

		Here is a direction in which the English schoolboy remains not merely in hope -
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DTATi 57 less ignorance , but with teachers who know quite as little ; nor can thej ' , indeed , spare the time to know more .

		Any American who doubts this needs only to look about him in the reading-room of any
London	LOCATION	club and see how the smallest country newspaper is sure of attentive readers if only printed in
England	LOCATION	, and how few read French or German papers , and how surely the stray
New York	LOCATION	` Nation ' or ` Tribune ' if there be one , has to be hunted up in a comer , where only some American guest ever opens it .

		Such is , or at least was , the state of things a few years ago , before President
Roosevelt	PERSON	had startled even English readers into curiosity .

		Until within a few years at least , they seemed at best in the mood of the
Cambridge	LOCATION	-LRB-
Mass.	LOCATION	-RRB- schoolgirl who complained to her mother , the other day , that she did not wish to study American history any more , it was ` so cluttered up with Adamses . '

		It happened to me , a quarter of a century ago , to be dining with six or eight university men , at the table of the one Englishman who is said to know more of this country than any other .

		Talk fell upon the ignorance on the part of Englishmen of all but three or four American authors ; and I , to hold my own , had to make a decisive point in the game .

		I called attention to the fact that the most eminent of our historians , and the one least likely to be superseded , was so absolutely unknown in
England	LOCATION	that probably not a person present , except our host , would even recognize his name .

		This being received with a general smile of incre - dulity , I gave the name of
Francis Parkman	PERSON	; upon which the guests all admitted , with English frank - ness , that they had never heard of such a per - son , -- all .

		that is , except the youngest of the com - pany , who had been for a short time in Wash - ington , on the staff of the British minister , and who had a vague impression that he had heard the name before .

		It is now nearly twelve years since
Parkman	PERSON	died , and he is perhaps less abso - lutely unknown in
England	LOCATION	than during the greater i ^ art of his life ; but does the class of students among whom not only he , but the great theme he handled , passed unnoticed , afford an adequate school for the whole training of an American youth ?

		Grant its vaiue as subsidiary training ; gi-ant the imequalled charm thrown by Professor Butcher , for instance , about Greek and Latin studies ; yet all this can be transplanted to
America	LOCATION	more easily than one trace of the
Ameri	PERSON	- can intellectual atmosphere can be transferred to
England	LOCATION	.

		To lose this is to risk that sense of vague homelessness , which was so pathetic in
Henry James	PERSON	's ; lectures this
last season	DATE	, and which has recalled in the newspapers that old saying that even his cosmopolitanism has its lim - itations , since to be truly cosmopolitan one must be at home even in his own country .

		JAPANESE IMPERIAL POETRY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		I have occasionally sent you specimens of Japanese Imperial Poetry , of which some of the latest may be found in your issue of
January 1 , 1905	DATE	.

		I am now glad to be able to call attention to a collection of such poems , made by Prof.
Arthur Lloyd	PERSON	, of the
Imperial University	ORGANIZATION	.

		He has recently issued , through the
Kinkodo Publishing Company	ORGANIZATION	,
Tokyo	LOCATION	, a volume of 159 pages with the title of ` Imperial Songs . '

		These include poems , not merely by the Emperor and the
Empress	ORGANIZATION	, the Crown Prince and the Crown Princess , but also by other distinguished personages , like
Baron Takasaki	PERSON	, ` Poet Laureate of
Japan	LOCATION	. '

		Most of the poems are ` tanka ' of only thirty-one syllables ; but there are also specimens of the ` naga-uta ' or long poems .

		The Japanese originals are given on one page , and the translations on the opposite pages .

		Professor
Lloyd	PERSON	has not attempted to give a literal translation of these concise poems , but has exercised considerable license in paraphrasing them in such a way as to bring out the hidden meaning .

		He has also added occasional notes to explain the purpose of a poem or the meaning of an allusion .

		The volume is a valuable contribution to the English literature of things Japanese .

		I append a few examples of the poems . '

		58 THE
DIAX	ORGANIZATION	^ -LSB-
August 11	DATE	Cfei i ^ to gooks .

		Ax English Statesman of the Old School .

		* There is a noticeable tendency nowadays , on the part of over-zealous relatives and friends , to inflict upon a long-suffering public intermin - able biographies of men whose lives and achieve - ments were essentially mediocre .

		The conven - tional two - volume ' Life ^ has thus conie into such disrepute that even in the case of a sub - ject of such undoubted eminence as the late
Marquis	PERSON	of Dufferin the reader hesitates before plunging into the pages of his formidable-look - ing biography .

		It may be said at once , how - ever , that here at least is an exception , and a brilliant exception , to the rule which some of us would like to see generally enforced against monumental biographies .

		Whether the credit is due chiefly to Sir
Alfred Lyall	PERSON	, who wrote it , or to the inherent qualities of his subject , the fact remains that , having once opened the book , its six hundred odd pages slip by in a way that one generally associates more with a book of fiction than of biography .

		Making every deduc - tion for the imperfections inseparable from even the best biographies , one reaches the conclusion that here a really great subject has been treated both adequately and effectively .

		It is one of the chief merits of Sir
Alfred Lyall	PERSON	's work that he has absolutely possessed himself of the great secret of true biography : to submerge the biographer 's own personality , and allow the life of his subject to speak for itself .

		It may seem at first sight an easy task to edit the journals and correspondence of a great man in such a way as to give a clear , con - secutive , and readable account of his life ; but anyone who has succeeded in producing such a biography will give a very different version of the difficulties to be overcome .

		The present biographer was fortunate in having access to a very extensive mass of private and official corre - spondence from and to
Lord Dufferin	LOCATION	, covering most of the periods of his long and eventful career ; and this correspondence he has worked into his narrative with rare skill , discrimina - tion , and good taste .

		Few public men have covered so wide a field of usefulness as
Lord Dufferin	ORGANIZATION	.

		Educated at
Eton	ORGANIZATION	and
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, he had scarcely left college before he threw himself energetically into the strong current of public affairs .

		Some of his earliest activities had to do with the difficult problem of the administration of
Ireland	LOCATION	, and from that time to the clos e of his life Lord * The Life of the
Mahquis of Duffbbin	ORGANIZATION	and Ava .

		By Sir
Alfred Lyall	PERSON	,
P.O. London	LOCATION	:
John Murray	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		Dufferin never for a moment wavered in his affection for
Ireland	LOCATION	and her people , nor ceased in his efforts to better their condition .

		For some years we find him filling minor offices at Court and in the
Government	ORGANIZATION	, presid - ing over several important Eoyal commissions , taking an active part in the deliberations of
Parliament	LOCATION	, travelling everywhere in
Europe	LOCATION	, and carrying on always a correspondence witli his hosts of friends in and out of public life , which throws a clear light upon a personality which was in so many ways remarkable and attractive .

		Perhaps nowhere else does one get a better conception of his true character than in
Lord Dufferin	LOCATION	's letters to his mother , that bril - liant daughter of the Sheridans .

		The warmth of his affection for his mother shines through all the early pages of his life , and it was as beau - tifully commemorated in the famous
Helen	PERSON	's Tower , dedicated to her use while she lived , and to her memory thereafter .

		Everyone knows
Tennyson	PERSON	's lines , so perfectly appropriate to the theme , as
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	well knew how to make them , -- * nervous , granite-like words , ' as Lord Dufferin himself described them . '

		Helen 's Tower , here I stand , Dominant over sea and land .

		Son 's love built me ^ and I hold Mother 's love in lettered gold .

		Would my granite girth were strong As either love , to last as long .

		I should wear my crown entire To and thro ' the Doomsday Are , And be found of angel eyes In earth 's recurring Paradise . '

		But one can not do better than quote
Lord Dufferin	PERSON	's own tribute to this remarkable wo - man , from whom he derived many of the charac - teristics which he describes in her .

		` Thus there went out of the world ' -LRB- he says -RRB- ` one of the sweetest , most beautiful , most accom - plished , wittiest , most loving , and lovable human beings that ever walked upon the earth .

		There was no quality wanting to her perfection ; and I say this , not prompted by the partiality of a son , but as one well acquainted with the world , and with both men and women .

		There have been many ladies who have been beautiful , charming , witty , and good , but I doubt whether there have been any who have combined with so high a spirit , and with so natural a gaiety and bright an imagina - tion as my mother 's , such strong unerring good sense , tact , and womanly discretion ; for these last characteristics , coupled with the intensity of her affections , were the real essence and deep founda - tions of my mother 's nature . '

		With such a mother , one need not wonder that the son developed into a true , honorable , and manly man , a warm and steadfast friend , a charming companion , a brilliant , broad-minded and patriotic statesman .

		We now reach the point in
Lord Dufferin	LOCATION	's career where he entered upon what might be called the upper plane of public life .

		In
1873	DATE	he was appointed
Governor General of Canada , 190O	ORGANIZATION	.

		J THE DIAL , 59 one of the highest and most important offices in the gift of the British Crown .

		Six years later he returned to
England	LOCATION	, and after a very brief visit to
Clandeboye	PERSON	, his Irish home , went to
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	as Ambassador to the Court of the Czar .

		It is interesting to note , as a remark - able tribute to
Lord Dufferin	ORGANIZATION	's standing as a diplomat and statesman that although then and always a staunch Liberal he was sent to
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	by
Lord Beaconsfield	ORGANIZATION	, as the only man for the place , at a peculiarly trying and critical moment .

		Upon his return from
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	, his knowledge of the intricate problems of the
Near East	LOCATION	, gained in connection with an earlier mis - sion to
Syria	LOCATION	, and through extensive travels in
Egypt	LOCATION	, pointed him out as the man for the vacant ambassadorship to
Constantinople	LOCATION	, where a strong diplomat was badly needed to uphold British prestige and steer the Sultan through the rocks of Oriental intrigue .

		In
1884	DATE	,
Lord Dufferin	PERSON	accepted the office of Viceroy of
India	LOCATION	, an office which he filled with most conspicuous success .

		The intricate and delicate problems of Indian administration , the annexation of
Burmah	ORGANIZATION	, the relations with
Afghanistan	LOCATION	, the menacing advance of Eussia toward the northwest boundary , were all han - dled with consummate skill .

		It is worth noting that
Lord Dufferin	PERSON	was equally successful in two such radically different offices as the Viceroyalty of
India	LOCATION	and the Governor Generalship of Can - ada ; the former corresponding in a measure to an absolute , the latter to a constitutional mon - archy .

		In
India	LOCATION	he had to rely in large measure upon his own judgment in the administration of the domestic affairs of the great dependency , while in both domestic and foreign affairs he was hampered by the cumbrous machinery of the
India Office	ORGANIZATION	and the
Foreign Office	ORGANIZATION	at Home .

		In
Canada	LOCATION	, on the other hand , he had no direct control of the government of the country , and had to rely upon his own native shrewdness , his close knowledge of human nature , and the com - pelling power of his personality , to achieve those ends which he deemed essential to the best inter - ests of both the Dominion and the British Em - pire .

		Here again one may note the admirable skill with which he handled the very difficult situation created by what was known in
Cana	LOCATION	- dian politics as the
Pacific Scandal	LOCATION	, involving the temporary downfall of the great Canadian statesman .

		Sir
John Macdonald	PERSON	, and his gov - ernment .

		Of his ambassadorship at
Eome	ORGANIZATION	, and after - ward at
Paris	LOCATION	, there is not space to say anything here .

		In
1896	DATE	he retired definitely from public life , to the great regret of the Queen , the gov - ernment , and the country .

		Of the generosity of
Lord Dufferin	ORGANIZATION	's nature and the warmth of his Irish heart , we get a last glimpse in his much-quoted letter to
Lord Salisbury	PERSON	, written two days before his death : ' I do not think you ever knew how much 1 liked you ... This is all that I have strength to say .

		Good-bye , and God bless you . '

		The warm personal friendship which could subsist between two such strong political oppo - nents as
Lord Dufferin	LOCATION	and
Lord Salisbury	PERSON	is one of the finest characteristics of British poli - tics , and one which might well be emulated on this side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	, both north and south of the international boundary .

		LaWBENCE J. BUEPEE .

		Bulgarian and Roumaxiax Folk-songs .

		* That the interest in folk-songs and folk-lore is reviving is evidenced by the appearance of two new volumes in which have been gathered songs and stories that have come from the hearts of two neighboring nations ,
Bulgaria	LOCATION	and Kou - mania .

		They appeal to us because in them we find the love , the aspirations , the anguish , the mysteries of the human soul .

		They are the wild-flowers of human nature .

		Among all the collectors of Bulgarian folk - songs , the three most important have been
Petko Slaveikoff	PERSON	,
Stephen Verkovich	PERSON	, and
Dmitri Miladinoff	PERSON	.

		After
Slaveikoff	PERSON	's death , an enormous number of unprinted folk-songs wa * found among his papers .

		Many of these have since been published in the collections of other men .

		It was he who wrote down the epic songs of Marco which were printed by the
Eussian Academy of Science	ORGANIZATION	in
1855	DATE	.

		His greatest work was , however , the collection and publica - tion of proverbs , the second volume of whichi was brought out after his death , by his heirs .

		The two volumes contain over seventeen hun - dred proverbs .

		He did a great service to humanity also through his Bulgarian transla - tion of the
Bible	LOCATION	, which was published by the
American Bible Society	ORGANIZATION	.

Petko Slaveikoff	PERSON	and one of the authors of ' The Shade of the

August 1	DATE	, 1874-82 , and he alleges that like the
Bohemian Hanka	PERSON	, who discovered his own poems in the vaults of the church-tower of
Koniginhof	LOCATION	, so did
Yerkovich	PERSON	find in the
Ehodope Mountains	LOCATION	a colossal and most amazing seam of poetry .

		I have no means of verifying or refuting this accusation .

		Perhaps the best collection of Bulgarian folk - songs is that of
Dmitri Miladinoff	PERSON	and his brother , which was published in
1861	DATE	through the munificence of Dr.
Strossmayer	PERSON	, who has been Bishop of
Djakovo	LOCATION	in
Croatia	LOCATION	for more than fifty-five years . '

		The Shade of the Bal - kans ' is now dedicated to this generous man .

		Since the days of these famous collectors , twenty-one volumes of Bulgarian folk-songs have been published , and the ' Sbornik , ' a jour - nal of folk-lore , science , and literature , issued by the
Bulgarian Minister of Education	ORGANIZATION	, con - tinues to be a storehouse for songs and other folk-lore . '

		The Shade of the
Balkans	LOCATION	' is divided into three parts : ^ The Folk-Song of the Bulgars , ' by Mr.
Pencho Slaveikoff	PERSON	; ` The Shade of the
Balkans	LOCATION	, ^ which includes one hundred and one songs , one hundred and one proverbs , and appendix and notes , by Mr.
Henry Bernard	PERSON	; and ' The Origin and Language of the Primi - tive Bulgars , ' by Mr.
E. J. Dillon	PERSON	.

		The intro - duction has been written by Mr.
Bernard	PERSON	.

		It has not been possible for students to estab - lish a tenable theory as to the exact birthplace of the Bulgarian folk-songs , but two serious attempts have been made , and each one places the origin in
Macedonia	LOCATION	.

		Without accepting these theories , Mr.
Slaveikoff	PERSON	divides
Bulgaria	LOCATION	into three song-provinces , and maintains that the north and the south are the chief sources of the heiduck songs , the
Rhodope Mountains	LOCATION	, up to the river
Vardar	ORGANIZATION	, of the love-songs , and western
Bulgaria	LOCATION	and
Macedonia	LOCATION	, beyond the
Vardar	LOCATION	, of the hero songs ; and he finds no truth in the assertion that the songs of northern Bul - garia , when contrasted with songs from other parts fall short in poetical power , and that in general the natives of the north are less richly endowed with power than their southern kins - men .

		But in northern
Bulgaria	LOCATION	new folk-songs are being created under the immediate influence of artistic poetry ; this is due to the reawakening of Bulgarian culture , and is the herald of grave changes in the very character of the folk-song , Mr.
Slaveikoff	PERSON	says .

		The author draws atten - tion to the fact that the motive and the subject of Bulgarian folk-songs often show evidence of venerable age .

		The following fragment , for instance , reminds one very forcibly , he thinks , of the goddess who undertook to procure a new shield for the Homeric heroes : ' The witch knew that a sword was ia Stamboul , A hero-sword that
Marko	PERSON	must possess , She leaped upon her brown , swift-running deer .

		Dark adders did she seize upon for reins And for the stirrups fiercely-shining adders , While for the whip she swung a yellow snake .

		And so she whirled along to buy the sword . '

		Such similarities are common , and they seem to indicate a close connection with the songs of classic
Greece	LOCATION	.

		The chief characteristic of these songs , as of all folk-songs , is objectiveness .

		In this they differ from artistic poetry .

		In some of them we find a rather severe mode of expression , which is reflected in the general tone .

		The form is more or less varied , and the division into strophes is usual .

		Their purely outward characteristics are the lack of rhyme and the peculiar rhythm .

		The rhythm is multifarious and highly elastic , Mr.
Slaveikoff	PERSON	says ; and it does not adapt itself to the usual pronunciation of the words , but to the number of syllables , with one or more inter - mediate accents according to which the verses are divided into rhythmical parts .

		Each verse contains from four to fourteen syllables , and is divided into two or four rhythmical parts .

		In the hero songs the prevailing verse has ten sylla - bles , in nearly all others eight syllables .

		A passage in Mr.
Bernard	PERSON	's Introduction describes the peculiar method of selecting the songs in this book : ` This is the process which each of them under - went : after
Slaveikoff	PERSON	had given a discursive and charmingly allusive translation into German , we debated -- not always , I confess , without ferocity -- as to whether we should include it .

		If the objec - tions were overcome Slaveikoff gave a more accu - rate rendering and in order that I should preserve the metre , with its accentuation , he spoke in Bul - garian various lines which I took down pho - netically .

		But , apart from the limits of language , it is a perilous affair to translate the half-lights and subtleties of poetry , and one of the para - mount joys of our work was the result of our limi - tations .

		Whenever we came to a passage that was at all recondite , we set about the conquest of it by means of metaphor and illustrative anecdote and fearless flights of the imagination . '

		This is in sharp contrast with Mile .

		Yacaresco 's method of collecting folk-songs and legends for her book .

		The following selections represent the differ - ent varieties of songs : ' The wind is blowing over the fields .

		But out of my heart it sweeps not the darkness .

		I would that a wind should be made of my sighs , That it would speed over mountain and valley , And it will surely find my beloved .

		It will sing him a desolate song .

		It will sing till he thinks of me . ' '

		Sore , sore afflicted was
Nicholas	PERSON	the Tartar , Nine endless years had he lain in bed , In among his hair grew the grass already .

		While a swarm of flies buzzed within his ears , And from his body many worms were crawling .

		He could not be cured , neither could tie die . '

		Place in it thy sorrows and mine .

		The wood did neither weave nor spin For through the
winter	DATE	she was ill .

		But when it was
Saint George	PERSON	's Day , The joyous festival of
spring	DATE	.

		She was arrayed in finished robes .

		In finished robes of emerald . '

		The proverbs have been taken without excep - tion from Mr ,
Petko Slaveikoflfs	PERSON	two volumes previously mentioned .

		Some of the most inter - esting follow : ` Onlv the nightingale can understand the rose . '

		` Woman desires three husbands at once : one rich , one comely , one fierce , -- to support her , to love her , to beat her . '

		` The smaller saints will be the ruin of God . '

		` The clergyman 's son is the devil 's grandson . '

		` Death speaks the truth . '

		In the proverbs , as a whole , there is mirrored , according to the opinion of Mr.
Pencho Slavei	PERSON	- koff , more than anywhere else that extremity of individualism which so sharply differentiates the Bulgarian from his neighbors , and his brood - ing undemonstrative character crops out here and there .

		In not a few there is something to justify Mr.
Slaveikoff	PERSON	^ s regrettable assertion that ' there is little in .

		married life save toil and torment and tribulation . '

		Basing his arguments upon the work of Mr.
Shishmanov	PERSON	, Mr.
Dillon	PERSON	concludes , in the third section of the book , that Bulgar means * Volga man , ' and he says it is manifest , consequently , that this people must have dwelt on the shores of the
Volga	LOCATION	before their division into two branches , and it is equally clear that they lived there for a long period before that event .

		The book contains much of great interest , but we deplore the evident hasty preparation , the newspaper style , the immoderate tone , the preju - dice , and above all the unwarranted and undig - nified attack upon the work of '
Carmen Sylva	PERSON	' and Mile .

		Vacaresco , who have performed a really noble service in presenting to the world the beautiful folk-songs of
Eoumania	LOCATION	; they have done for that country what Professor
T. F. Crane	PERSON	has done for
Italy	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Slaveikoff	PERSON	, for instance , speaking of ' The Bard of the
Dimbo	PERSON	- vitza , '' a collection of songs published by Mile .

		Vacaresco with the collaboration of the Queen of
Eoumania	LOCATION	, makes the amazing charge that they are * manufactured songs , ' that ' the Rou - manian peasant has not the remotest idea of these songs , ' and that they are * nothing more than a fabrication of the Merry Wives of
Bucharest	LOCATION	. '

		We can understand the fierceness of such an accusation when we read Mr.
Ber	PERSON	- nard 's characterization of his collaborator in the Introduction : * Slaveikoff is the caged lion of
Sofia	LOCATION	.

		Great , massive shoulders , a massive head , swarthy with beard of black and silver -LRB- though the poet is under forty -RRB- , a brow that sets one thinking , and eyes - -- eyes weary with the world 's trouble , dark - iLig eyes , eyes of the twilit woods , then of a wood - land faun , eyes that lure you and dance away from you , eyes that laugh at you and their owner , unbearable eyes .

		Slaveikoff is the figure of revolt . '

		But we are touched with a feeling of generosity toward Mr.
Slaveikoff	PERSON	by a communication from Mr.
Bernard	PERSON	in which he says : * For the sake of unity and convenience , I put all the denuncia - tion of Miss V. into
Slaveikoff	PERSON	's mouth at the conclusion of his essay in our book .

		As a mat - ter of fact , I collected the various items from him and from others . '

		And this essay is pre - sumably by Mr.
Slaveikoff	PERSON	, and is signed by him , and yet a part of it , on Mr.
Bernard	PERSON	's own admission , is a compilation by himself .

		Such a procedure casts suspicion upon the whole book .

		There can , of course , be no real doubt as to the authenticity of the songs published by Mile .

		Vacaresco and subscribed to by '
Carmen Sylva	PERSON	. '

		It is indeed preposterous that a reigning Queen of the noble character of
Elisabeth of Roumania	ORGANIZATION	should be allowed by her subjects to sign an assertion which might be declared false any day .


Carmen Sylva	PERSON	went to
Roumania	LOCATION	in her youth , and for more than twenty-five years she has studied the soul of the Roumanian peasants and the folk-lore of the land .


Helene Vacaresco	PERSON	is a maid of honor to this
Queen	PERSON	, a member of the highest aristocracy , a daughter of a former minister plenipotentiary , and at least two of her books have been crowned by the French Academy , one being the very work condemned by the authors of * The Shade of the
Balkans	LOCATION	, ' and it was recommended to the Academy by one of the greatest French authorities on the sub - ject ,
M. Gaston Paris	PERSON	.

		M.
Andre Bellessort	PERSON	, who has recently published in the * Revue des
Deux Mondes	PERSON	' a series of articles on his two years ' study and travel in
Roumania	LOCATION	, is led to quote Mile .

		Vacaresco 's works as the best expres - sion of what he saw and admired .

		All these facts vouch for their honesty and integrity , and certainly they are worthy of respectful treat - ment .

		It appears , though , as if the authors of ` The Shade of the
Balkans	LOCATION	' were trying to draw attention to their own work by decrying the work of others .

		As a further example , Mr.
Bernard	PERSON	published in the
London	LOCATION	'
Bookman	PERSON	' for
April	DATE	a sarcastic review of Mile .

		Vacaresco 's ' Songs of the
Valiant Voivode	ORGANIZATION	, ' at the same time speaking of a part of his own book as ' brilliant . '

		In reading ' The Shade of the Bal - 62 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
August 1	DATE	, kans ' I have not felt the pious sensation expe - rienced by another reviewer , about whom Mr.
Bernard	PERSON	reports that ' he feels he might as well review the
Bible	LOCATION	. '

		Indeed , ` the smaller saints will be the ruin of God ' !

		I recommend to the authors another of their proverbs : * That from your life the sourness may depart You must have sweetness come into your heart . ' '

		Songs of the
Valiant Voivode	ORGANIZATION	/ as stated on the title-page , were collected among the Rou - manian peasants .

		In a personal letter , Mile .

		Vacaresco reaflfirms this assertion , and says that many of these songs were told to her by the servants in her father 's house , by an old gar - dener , and by a nurse .

		The following quota - tions from the dedicatory epistle to her cousin breathe the spirit of the book : ` These tales and ` legends of our dear country belong to you by right of inheritance and by birth - right too .

		For months I have wandered from village to village and gathered the strange sweet stories ; they grow like flowers in the wide domains that bear our name ... You know how pecu - liarly proud and graceful is the stature of a Kou - manian peasant against the golden sky of our native land , and how much he still retains in his mind and his words the love of imaginative crea - tion of symbols , and of song . '

		The titles of some of the most characteristic songs and stories are : ' The Enchanted Palace Between the Enchanted Trees , ' ` The White Serpent and the Little Beggar Girl , ' ' The Wil - lows ' Daughter , ' ' The Fairy and the Waterfall , ' ` Thisca , ' ` The Church-builder . '

		There are many others that are equally beautiful , and in nearly all the genuine flavor of the folk-song is easily detected .

		The opening lines of the story of Dragomira are touching in their sweet simplicity : ` Dragomira was the sweetest and fairest girl in the village ; she loved God , the sunlight , and the birds ; she tended all the living and frail creatures that came across her , and her heart , was as clear and bright as the crystal beads of her necklace and the new-born flowers she wore every morning in her hair .

		Yet Dragomira died one even - ing when there was neither sun nor moon to mourn over her in the sky , when all the little birds were asleep .

		* The introductory lines to the song about the Moldavian Princess and the fairy make their appeal through delicate feeling : ' I have come to the well , and though my pitcher 's full I 'll not return till I see the moon rise , Because the sweet moon when she rises Sometimes relates a tale to me , And I love the tales of the moon .

		For the moon sees the hearts of maidens and their tears , Even more than the sun .

		I love the tales of the moon , For the moon travels far and yet always returns To her place in the sky .

		For the moon looks on cradles and looks on graves With the same smile .

		Ah !

		I love the tales of the moon .

		This tale the moon hath told , which I will tell to thee . '

		Note the imagery in the lines from the story about
Hie	PERSON	and Pauna : `
Pauna	LOCATION	, the fair daughter of the
Voivode	ORGANIZATION	, was sitting in the moonlight on the banks of the river , her spindle in her hand , her distaff in her belt , while the maidens around her filled the silvery hours with tales of valour and love .

		A wandering shepherd 's flute was heard from the neighboring hill , and the water laughed and sighed by turns as it glided at their feet beneath the tall reeds .

		The maidens who sat around the young Princess were twelve maidens fair , but fairer than
Pauna	LOCATION	was none as she listened to their words , and sighed and laughed by turns like the water between the reeds . '

		An explanation of the differences between these Roumanian songs and legends and the Bulgarian songs may be found in the differences between the two nations .

		A few of the Rou - manian pieces display love of battle and of blood ; but on the whole , as compared with the Bulgarian songs , the Roumanian show more simplicity , more poetic sympathy with nature , more sensitiveness to music , and more joy in an ideal of justice and of beauty .

		Naturally attracted to the educational side of his subject by reason of his having been for five years teacher in one of the government schools of
Japan	LOCATION	he looks at this young nation 's early culture , adolescence , and modern school-days , and ever with a criti - cal eye .

		It is not at all certain that Dr.

		THE DIAL ea as
Heam	ORGANIZATION	and Arnold so sedulously direct our attention . '

		The two cancers at the core of the Japanese character are deep-set dishonesty and abandoned impurity . '

		The sale of daughters by their parents for immoral purposes under the guise of ' filial piety ' and licensed prostitution as a source of government revenue , are still * institutions / ' even while the five noble qualities of the Japanese character -- bravery , loyalty , alertness , thoroughness and self-control , -- charm the world .

		With
Ito	PERSON	as exponent of
Japan	LOCATION	's purely cultural creed , and
Okuma	ORGANIZATION	's plea that the Biblical type of noble life will never be out of date , the author concludes that the present is the critical period of this sturdy young nation 's life .

		Shall
Okuma	ORGANIZATION	's advice to welcome the Christian missionaries and their book and message , or
Ito	PERSON	's , to accept the ma - terialism of the West and virtually ignore its religions , be taken ?

		Upon the answer to this question , says Dr.
Scherer	PERSON	, depends the future manhood of
Japan	LOCATION	.

		The style of the book is clear , straightforward , and marked by ease and poise .

		It is the book for the hour ; for the chief problems about
Japan	LOCATION	just now concern her real purpose and moral force .

		It is a good thing for
Japan	LOCATION	, standing as the vanguard of
Asia	LOCATION	, to have native as well as alien interpreters .

		Heretofore , strangers who see but the surface of things have been rather voluble in explaining to the world the causes and mean - ing of the re-birth of
Japan	LOCATION	.

		Xow , however , we have sons of the soil speaking of these matters with authority .

		Already a respectable company of Japanese writers of English are uttering their plea and defense , their vindication and explana - tion , -- Nitobe ,
Suyematsu	LOCATION	,
Kaneko	PERSON	,
Adachi	PERSON	, and the Okakura brothers .

		One of these lat - ter ,
Kakuzo	PERSON	, has written on * The Awakening of
Japan	LOCATION	, ' and the other , whose work is now under review , has essayed to unveil the mysteries and potencies of the Japanese spirit .

		This book is not so strong or original as * The Awakening of
Japan	LOCATION	, ' but it seems to do more justice to the work and influence of Buddhism as the mother and nurse of Japanese civilization .

		The Intro - duction , by Mr.
George Meredith	PERSON	, need not con - cern an American very seriously , though Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	shows that the foolish talk of the Yel - low Peril is , inthe light of the revelations of this work , simply fatuous .

		These ' Spartans in fight .

		Stoics in grief ' will not be inflated to the point of insanity by the success of their arms .

		This book owes its existence to the suggestions of Mr.
Martin White	PERSON	, whose keen interest in comparative sociology led to the opening of special courses for its investigation in the Uni - versity of
London	LOCATION	.

		In its literary form , it is the reproduction and expansion of the lecture delivered there by its author , it having no table of contents - or index , the matter forming in itself one uninterrupted chapter .

		After naming some of the scholars who have helped the Japanese both to know and tc express themselves , the author passes on to the question of the origin of his people .

		Like most tfapanese , he will not acknowledge the Ainu , a straight-eyed and big-nosed white race , whose hairiness has been somewhat exaggerated , to be in part progenitors of the present Japanese race .

		He does not seem to be acquainted with the researches of Dr.
Batchelor	PERSON	, who finds in the Ainu language -LRB- not * Aino , ' which means dog 's offspring -RRB- a near relative to the Aryan family .

		American ladies will be sorry to learn , what nevertheless is entirely true , that straight eyes and eyebrows make a very bad impression on the Japanese , suggesting weakness , lasciv - iousness , and so on .

		Blue eyes and blond hair are extraordinary , in no favorable sense of the term .

		Brief and on the whole brilliant analyses of the original mental pabulum of the
Japan	LOCATION	- ese , as furnished by Confucianism ,
Taoism	LOCATION	, and Buddhism , are given ; but the author frankly confesses , what all students know , that the Jap - anese are not a people with much aptitude for deep metaphysical ways of thinking .

		No
Kant	PERSON	or
Schopenhauer	PERSON	is likely to be produced in
Japan	LOCATION	, where even the leaders have the easy contentment of men of action .

		The canon of Buddhism has never been translated into the vernacular , and the abstruse conceptions of
India	LOCATION	and
China	LOCATION	were received just as they were preached , being quickly generalized and turned into so many working principles .

		In a word , the Japanese are a very practical , matter - of-fact people .

		Even true ancestor-worship , -- though the author does not acknowledge it , -- ^ is of Chinese , not native , origin .

		Imported from
China	LOCATION	, this cult was immediately turned into a political engine .

		The author shows many signs of having read Xitobe well .

		He acknowledges
Japan	LOCATION	's large indebtedness to the Zen sect of Buddhism , especially in treating of
Bushido	LOCATION	, which he exploits handsomely .

		It is most delightful and refreshing to find a Japanese writer who , while stalwart in maintaining
Yamato Damashii	PERSON	-LRB- really Japanese wit , not Yalor , rather than Chinese learning -RRB- , winds up with a sentence like this : * We feel it a most agreeable duty gratefully to acknowledge our immense obligation to the nations of the
West	LOCATION	. '

		* The ' Poems , Lyric and Dramatic ' of Miss
Ethel Louise Cox	PERSON	are of singularly fine quality .

		We will begin to justify this assertion by quot - ing the lyric called * Sleep . ' '

		Soft fall upon mine eyelids , gentle Sleep , Like rain of roses !

		though I wake to weep , Quiet my heart ! '

		Bring on thy wings that peace that day denies , The dewy balm that with the morrow flies ; And then depart ! '

		Love hath its own sweet joy and dear delight : And Thought its aery blisses , fancy light !

		Dearer thou art ! '

		The inspiration of this song seems to come from
Shelley	PERSON	, and it is of him that we are reminded upon many other pages , particularly on those that contain a * Prometheus ' fragment in dramatic form .

		Thus for example , speaks the
Voice	ORGANIZATION	of the
Earth	LOCATION	in the poem just named : ' Within my dreams I stir !

		I hear afar Aerial voices singing !

		tones divine !

		Yet heard I , trembling to my shuddering heart , An awful voice of anguish !

		agony Of him born of my fertile bosom , loved Of Earth , the
Titan	ORGANIZATION	.

		O let me no more Those fearful murmurs hearken from the heights .

		The solitary mountains !

		Keener grows The ancient pain of Earth ! '

		This extract , besides being an echo of
Shelley	LOCATION	, also illustrates the author 's predilection for classical themes , which are predominant among those of which she sings .

		And we find in some of these classical studies many signs of the influence of still another poet -- not a greater , but one more difficult of imitation .

		` Sighs Shook the pale lilies at her breast ; once more She raised the dewy cup within her palms .

		The limped water sparkled at its brim , '' Drink ! ''

		said she softly -- then tears fell within The chalice , mingling with the crystal draught ! '

		This has the very accent of Landor , and might easily pass for an extract from the * Hellenics . '

		The pure and wistful Landorian note is sus - tained in many of these pieces , which reproduce in really wonderful fashion his classic grace and restraint , with its sense of evanescent beauty and of * tears in mortal things . ' '

		Persephone in Hades ' is not too long for us to quote .

		` Drooping upon her throne , Persephone Eyed with dim looks the brooding darkness near ; And heard the river eddies rippling led To misty banks of amaranth and pale Lilies of faint
Elysium	LOCATION	; and her heart Passioned for meads of
Enna	ORGANIZATION	, flower-sweet !

		Young buds , and dewy flowers , and the dome Of the blue skies , the faint star of the morn , Clear drops of dew , the song of soaring birds In the white dawn , and odor-breathing winds ; Dreaming , she listened for voices of nymphs In pleasant vales , and river lawns .

		Beside Her , leaned dark
Pluto	LOCATION	, and his trembling words Whispered her close and sweet , were all unheard ; With promise of fair flowers as she lost ` Neath kinder skies -- rose leaf and daffodil !

		Of all the splendors of the halcyon earth -- So she would lift her fainting head !

		and ` neath His kiss , the last flower clinging to her locks -- Sole coronal of lone Persephone !

		Fell , with a shower of loose , odorous leaves . '

		We must make one more quotation , not this time to illustrate a thesis , but simply for the sake of the beauty embodied in these verses on ' Mutability . '

		` We prize but what we lose !

		Could the
spring	DATE	stay .

		With its pure skies , perfumes , and rose , alway .

		Nor burn to summer bright -- stayed that fair star , A-tremble in the evening hush afar .

		Fixed in mild splendor in the purple sky !

		Would our hearts leap with the
May	DATE	morn ?

		or sigh With passion for that one white sphere ?

		so fair , O youth , wild white swan of Life 's sea !

		would ` st e'er Be , if we knew not that on some green day Thou would ` st flee far , on faery seas away .

		To visionary lands , and meadows deep In fabled asphodel , and mists of sleep ? '

		The inclusion by
Miss Cox	ORGANIZATION	of the word ` dra - matic ' in the title of her book would be justified by the classical poems alone , many of which are dramatic in spirit if not in form .

		But a more literal justification is offered by the lengthy dramatic scene of * The Combat with the
Dragon	ORGANIZATION	' which closes the collection .

		This work , however , is much less impressive than the poems which precede it in what must , taken as a whole , be considered a noteworthy volume of verse , * The Shoes That Danced , and Other Poems , ' by Miss
Anna Hempstead Branch	PERSON	, is the sec - ond collection of verse published by this writer .

		The somewhat singular title of the volume belongs to the opening piece , which is a dra - matic sketch in blank verse of unusual quality , havinff
Watteau	ORGANIZATION	for its central figure .

		THE DIAL 66 Branch 's work exhibits a mind saturated with English poetry -- particularly its naive older forms -- and prettily echoes a variety of man - ners .

		It is touched with mysticism , and has considerable imaginative reach .

		Many of the pieces are marred by obscurity and an obvious straining for effect .

		A few verses from ' Under the Trees ' may be quoted : ' The wonderful , strong , angelic trees .

		With their blowing locks and their bared great knees And nourishing bosoms , shout all together And rush and rock through the glad wild weather . '

		They are so old they teach me .

		With their strong hands they reach me .

		Into their breast my soul they take .

		And keep me there for wisdom 's sake .

		* They teach me little prayers ; To-day I am their child ; The sweet breath of their innocent airs Blows through me strange and wild . '

		So many things they know , So learned with the ebb and flow By which the seasons come and go .

		Still the forefather stands With unforgetting eyes .

		Forever holding in his tranquil hands The fruit that makes us wise . '

		Miss
Edith Colby Banfield	PERSON	, whose brief life came to an end
two years ago	DATE	, had published a few poems in the magazines , but the bulk of the work now collected into a volume was left in manuscript .

		These poems have been published just as they were found among her papers , and , in spite of the lack of polish which marks some of them , they are deserving of this perpetua - tion .

		How high was the writer 's ideal may be seen in the sonnet called * In PoetrVs High Tower . ' '

		Up in this belfry tower of poetry I flee disquiet and the vexing things Left far and dim below .

		` Mid fluttering wings I overlook the city under me , I see the morning break upon the sea .

		And watch the westward spires where evening clings : Yea , this old bell , obedient that rings , I even waken , halt and tremblingly .

		Could I but ring it as blind
Milton	PERSON	rung .

		I would not need to see the morning light ; What sounds would issue from its mighty tongue .

		More strong than death , more comforting than sight !

		Ah .

		let no weakling think he can regain One single peal of that triumphant strain ! '

		Since a full half of
Miss Banfield	LOCATION	's work con - sists of sonnets , we will quote another poem in this form , to illustrate the simple sincerity of her work , and its directness of expression .

		` Land and
Sea	ORGANIZATION	' is the title .

		* Unto His peoples God hath given the land .

		And there allows their petty ownerships .

		Their little acres and asundered strips Of titled earth , whereon their homes may stand ; But He the sea reserveth in His hand .

		And all the waters thereunto that flow ; The ships thereon are free to come and go By His sole sufferance ; strand to farthest strand The continents like documents reveal Man 's superscription and his countersign Traced on them legibly from line to line ; But like a hidden scroll the sea doth bear The single stamp of Gods great signet-seal Xor could he break it , who should even dare ! '

		Miss
Pattie Williams Gee	PERSON	's ' The Palace of the Heart , and Other Poems of Love ' is a thin volume of short pieces inspired mainly by relig - ious fervor .

		A set of couplets called ' Pax Vobiscum ' may serve us for an example . '

		If I could know your heart 's supreme desire .

		If I could pierce through Its devouring Are , Where this , unscorched , lies quivering , white and clear , Its consummation would I wish you , dear .

		But since these eyes may not behold the place Which shrines your anguish -- nor the void space .

		The empty chamber , flame-swept , phantom - wrought .

		For which your soul has bargained , sold and bought .

		Take thou the yearning of my own heart 's core : -- God 's soundless peace enfold you evermore , Soothing the troubled Presence with its balm .

		Filling the empty chamber with Its calm !

		-- Such peace be yours , dear , while the evening nears .

		Sweetening and deepening with the dying years ! '

		A rather striking poem , different in theme from the others , is the ' Mater
Mea Carolina	LOCATION	, ' which celebrates the heroism and devotion of
North Carolina	LOCATION	during the Civil War .

		We have at hand another of the charming little books , published in limited editions , into which Mr.
Clinton Scollard	PERSON	collects his poems .

		There are more than a dozen of these volumes altogether , and the production of the poet flows on with sustained energy .

		The present book contains longer pieces than usual .

		They are oalles ' Odes and Elegies , ' and are seven in number .

		One of them , a Phi Beta Kappa trib - ute to the memory of General
Lawton	PERSON	, yields for quotation this fine passage : ' Many there be who watch with grievM eyes .

		And brows aflush with shame .

		What they deem sacrilege in freedom 's name .

		And the mad warping of our destinies ; Feeling no thrill exultant In them rise , Howe'er beneath the sultry
Luzon	LOCATION	skies Our armies triumph , but a sense of blame .

		If ours the trespass , even as we sowed .

		And still are sowing , shall the reaping be !

		But who can follow this swift warrior 's road .

		Resistless as the surge of the gray sea .

		And not l > e moved that we can claim the man As type of what we name -- ^ American !

		And ah , the blinding pity of it all .

		If we be smirching with a guilty red The purity of Liberty 's fountain-head .

		That through our error such an one should fall ! '

		* The Dreamers ' is the opening poem in this collection , and one of the best , although to our thinking too liberally sprinkled with indiscrim - inately-chosen proper names .

		To this * The
March	DATE	of the Ideal ' is a companion ode .

		Of another , President
McKinley	PERSON	is the subject , and
Keats	PERSON	of still another .

		The remaining two , ' The Stars of Morning , ' and ' The Oriskany ' are nature-poems in their main inspiration .

		Mr.
Scollard	PERSON	's work sometimes seems labored , but he has imagination and lofty idealism for fairly steadfast companions , and they prompt him to an utterance which is usually worthy of his theme .

		The following sonnet , entitled * Sea Burial , ' is selected from * The
First Wardens	ORGANIZATION	, ' a volume of poems by Mr.
William J. Neidig	PERSON	: 66 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, ' A winding sheet , a broadside for the brave , A light on the blue sea one Instant known , A work unfinished -- Where his dust was strewn Is no more battle .

		Sea-moss shades his grave ; Coolness of coral spans his pearl-strewn cave ; Nor Pharaoh 's vaults more deaf to the sands blown .

		Nor silk cocoons more soft in Maytlme grown , Before the
summer	DATE	frees the textile slave !

		O give me .

		Star , my rest beneath the sea !

		There let me He , and let the deaf swells roll , Or craggy cliffs , like belfries wild and free .

		In palpitating peals my requiem toll !

		But grant me first my work may finished be : No sap-wood , when the axe strikes through the boll ! '

		It will be seen from this example that Mr.
Neidig	PERSON	is a poet who speaks with his own voice , and knows how to give vigorous expression to a fairly imaginative conception .

		In this case , also , the thought is clear-cut , and little of the mean - ing is left in doubt .

		We can not say as much , however , for most of the fellow-poems , which cultivate obscurity to an extent which is not permissible .

		Strained-for effects are apt to be effects missed , and much of Mr.
Neidig	PERSON	's verse , for all its originality and unquestionably poetic diction , makes too hard reading to fulfil the proper function of poetry .

		Yet we would not seem ungrateful for an offering whose fashion is so far beyond the average mechanical verse of the day , with its endless echoes and imitations .

		Mr.
Louis Vernon Ledoux	PERSON	's ' Songs from the Silent Land ' are , according to the author 's classification , grouped as poems of life , love , nature , and thought .

		The category of love may be illustrated by this irregular but beautiful sonnet : ' Since this is true : that thou dost love me , dear ; That thou wilt stoop my life to sanctify ; That thou wilt raise me now ere youth shall die .

		Above my twilight shadows , deep and drear .

		That I may reach the purer region high Where thou dost dwell , and ever still be near Thy side , and ever hear thy singing , clear And sweet as song of seraph In the sky : My love will teach me all that thou has known Of God and life , that I may catch through thee Prophetic glimpses of His truth and grace ; And watch in thee His semblance , clearly shown .

		Till in the sunlight of eternity , I come , at last to meet Him face to face . '

		The following nature-picture may fitly exem - plify another of the categories : ' In golden and scarlet pomp of Fall , Sabled with cedars the valley lay ; With darkling storm-clouds over all .

		Save here and there where a gleaming ray Prom the sun , like a molten sword of fire , Slanting fell from the flaming sphere .

		Where the hidden light of the world 's desire Is throned In the golden atmosphere .

		The river browned with a recent rain .

		With crested ridges of white-capped foam .

		Heedless of beauty in hill and plain .

		Eagerly swept to Its ocean home .

		The azure mountains far away Majestic rose neath the dark gray sky .

		Pinnacled clear on the verge of day , Steadfast , Immutable , calm and high ; Till a silent cloud of silver snow Passed like a veil o'er the domes of blue .

		And the sun behind in a sudden glow Colored its edge with a fervid hue . '

		These two examples show Mr.
Ledoux	PERSON	to have refined sensibilities and something of the poetic vision ; they are fairly representative of a body of work that is finished in execution and uni - formly pleasing .

		Mr.
William Wells Newell	PERSON	's ' Symphonic Series ' of ' Words for Music ' is in part the republication of a collection first published ten years ago .

		It is a volume of brief lyrics of nature and life , and this ` Love Thought ' is a fairly typical specimen . '

		The lake art thou , beloved , When the sunrise dawneth o'er ; My thoughts , they are water-lilies .

		That float and blow by the shore . '

		The forest art thou , beloved .

		Full leafy in warm
July	DATE	; My thoughts , they are crimson roses .

		That twine and blossom by . '

		The heaven art thou , beloved .

		All holy at still
midnight	TIME	; My thoughts , they are stars of
summer	DATE	.

		That beam with a peaceful light . '

		The most noticeable fault of the pieces is found in the frequent omission of articles and other small words necessary to the construction .

		This constitutes a rather irritating mannerism which the writer would do well to avoid .

		The ' Later Poems ' of the late
John White Chadwick	PERSON	have been garnered into a volume by the writer 's widow , and constitute a pleasing addition to our store of occasional and memorial verse .

		Mr.
Chadwick	PERSON	was always happily inspired when called upon to add the grace of poetry to some celebration , or to pay tribute to some departed friend .

		These verses on
Bryant	PERSON	will illustrate his quality : ' He loved the vales , the woods , the streams .

		The mountains cheered his loftier mind ; The winds their summits nurtured found His soul as free and uncoHflned . '

		A deeper joy his song instilled For every flower that gems the sod ; He looked through
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's trembling veil , And saw the face of
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's God . '

		Yet more the press of busy men Allured him than the forest aisle .

		And more the strife with public ill Than ever the blue heaven 's smile . '

		Wherever right her flag unfurled , And justice showed a better way , And truth and freedom spurned the
night	TIME	.

		And hailed the burnished spears of day , -- ' There was his place , and there he made His voice a clarion ringing clear To rouse the sleepers , wake the dead .

		And stay the faint with hope and cheer . '

		If
Bryant	PERSON	stood ever on the side of righteous - ness , this his latest singer was also steadfast in the good old American faith , as his '
Timeo Danaos	PERSON	' sonnet may witness . '

		Art proud , my country , that these mighty ones , Wearing the jeweled splendor of old days .

		Come bringing prodigality of praise To thee amid thy light of westering suns ;

		J THE DIAL .

		67 Bidding their blaring trumpets and their guns Salute thee , late into their crooked ways Now fallen ; to their sorrow and amaze .

		Blood of whose hearts the ancient honor runs ? '

		Nay , fear them rather , for they cry with glee , `` She has become as one of us , who gave All that she had to set a people free : She wears our image -- she that loved the slave ! ''

		Fear them , for there is blood upon their hands .

		And on their heads the curse of ruined lands . '

		We ma -RCB- - also commend to the attention of our modern imperialists the verses which comment , in caustic accents , upon President
Eoosevelt	PERSON	's remark that ` there was not enough of the last war to go round / ' The Ninth Paradise ' is a title suggested by these verses from the Arabic : ' In the nine heavens are eight Paradises : Where is the ninth one ?

		In the human breast . '

		Rather , O man I lack those eight Paradises Than be without the ninth one in thy breast . '

		This thought is expanded into ' Thyself Within , ' the first piece in a collection of poems by Mr.
James H. West	PERSON	. '

		Amid the ceaseless loss and change Of time and friends and all below , -- -LRB- O things we love ' .

		how swift ye go !

		O things that are : how new and strange ! -RRB-

		-- Ah , whither shall our spirits range A more eternal life to know ! '

		In
Syria	LOCATION	, Ind , or
Egypt	LOCATION	sought .

		One answer only have the years Sent down to banish doubts and fears : -- Within thyself must Heaven be caught And captive held , -- or all is tears !

		For this saints died and martyrs fought .

		• Thyself within !

		Thyself within !

		O soul !

		find here thy strength , thy peace .

		Pray not that loss and change may cease , -- Pray , rather , higher heights to win : Thy spirit 's heavenward wings release .

		And soar thee where thou art akin ! '

		The fine spirituality of these lines is dom - inant throughout the volume which they thus fittingly preface .

		Mr.
Wesf	PERSON	s poems breathe a gentle and exalted idealism ; they question the shows of life that they may search out its deeper meanings ; and they rest upon a firm basis of faith in the ' far-off divine event ' toward which mankind is slowly groping its way .

		They have the inspiration of
Tennyson	PERSON	and of
Emerson	LOCATION	in their acceptance of the present as an earnest for the future . '

		O humankind !

		from hills where darkness hides .

		From lands of old where lava-torrents hum , Down riverways tumultuous thou has come , -- With yet small lodgment found where grain abide : ^ .

		How slow the centuries !

		how blind the guides !

		The multitude -- how deaf and halt and dumb !

		Yet steadily Love 's wealth adds sum to sum .

		And age by age the flood of Wrong subsides . '

		Mr.
Lloyd Mifflin	PERSON	, whom we know best by his carefully-chiselled sonnets , is also an adept in other lyrical measures , as may be seen in his latest volume . '

		The Fleeing Nymph and
Other Verse	ORGANIZATION	, ^ although it comprises nearly fifty pieces , includes only three sonnets out of the entire number .

		There is much delicate art in these songs , and they are freighted with a rich bur - den of thought .

		We quote a pair of quatrains called ` Reproachful Ghosts . '

		• As glittering gall `` > n8 , scornful of the shore .

		Bound for the
Fortunate Isles	ORGANIZATION	with favoring breeze , Sink ere they reach their goal , and ever more Phantom the dim mid-seas : ' So , for the ports unknown , at lift of sun .

		We sail afar with flaunting pennon high ; Iiife whelms us , and the ghosts of deeds imdone Stalk in our evening sky . '

		Mr.
Edward 0	PERSON	.


Jackson	PERSON	's * Love Sonnets to
Ermingarde	PERSON	' are exactly one hundred in num - ber , and their recipient has reason to be proud of the imagery and emotion which she evokes in the soul of her poet .

		It is the Shakesperian model that Mr.
Jackson	PERSON	follows , both as to form and to diction , as the following pretty affecta - tion will illustrate : ' Creep on , proud time , adown the sightless track Of centuries and wallowing nations wrecked .

		Heap on deceased life oblivion 's black , And bring all things to an annulled effect : Tea ,
Time	ORGANIZATION	, thou treacherous traitor of deceit .

		That seem ` st to give what thou dost take away .

		Here I predict thy ignomy 's defeat .

		And all thy cruel crimes In hate array : Thou canst not , with thy false adulterate spite .

		Take from my Love 's flame one superfluous beam Of glory 's guerdon of eternal light Which to posterity shall ever gleam -- For why ?

		-- ^ My lines shall flout thy foul dismay .

		And in my lines my Love shall win the day . '

		The well-known musical critic , Mr.
W. J. Henderson	PERSON	, has published a volume of verse entitled , as becomes the author 's vocation , ' Pipes and Timbrels . '

		It includes sonnets , lyr - ics , and studies in smoothly-cadenced blank verse .

		We quote ' A

		The steel blue Vega slopes adown the west .

		Beyond the ghostly hills and shadowed stream , Downward to unfathomable rest .

		Sweeter than silence , dearer than a dream . '

		Like solemn music through a cloistered lane , Adown the west with the celestial bride . '

		O'erhead roll Taurus and the Pleiad band Along the hollows of the heavenly deep ;
Orion	ORGANIZATION	follows with his flaming brand .

		That smites the curtain of the eye to sleep . '

		So moves the shining army of the night Across the front of space , serene , profound .

		Till
Sirius	ORGANIZATION	floods the east with master light .

		And lo !

		One section of Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	,3 volume is de - voted , as might be expected , to poems upon musical subjects .

		Among them is an interest - ing transcript of the
Seventh Symphony	ORGANIZATION	, whereof the
Allegretto	PERSON	runs as follows : ' Shall death avail , love .

		Death cold and pale , love ?

		Shall we now quail , love We that are one ?

		Here where we lave , love .

		In passion 's wave , love ; Is there a grave , love .

		Out of the sun ?

		Ah , do not weep , love ; We two shall sleep , love .

		Wrapped in that deep , love , When life is run . '

		THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, A series of fifty-five sonnets , liaving epochs , ideals , and personalities for their themes , con - stituting a sort of fragmentary CuUurgeschichte in verse , is the work of Mr.
Gamaliel Bradford , Jr.	PERSON	, and is called ' A Pageant of Life / We select ' The
Eenaissance	PERSON	' for our illustration .

		` After the dreary night of blood and grief , A crimson dawn of joy and splendor flowed Out of the
East	LOCATION	, and touched the dark abode Of stupid , low-browed priest and feudal thief .

		All
Europe	LOCATION	woke and sighed with sweet relief .

		Wondered and watched , while clear and clearer glowed Old loveliness , which neither storms corrode Nor years can dim , though thick with gross belief .

		Then sudden poured the fount of beauty forth , Gorgeous with color , rich with phrase and rhyme .

		Packed close with human love and hate intense ; It purpled east , and west , and south , and north .

		Splendid with varying hues in every clime , A carnival of passion and of sense . '

		Besides these , and other , sonnets , Mr.
Brad	PERSON	- ford 's volume gives us some charming lyrics , a deeply-sympathetic poem placed upon the lips of
Leopardi	LOCATION	, and two successful translations from that world-wearied singer .

		A daring and somewhat unregulated imag - ination is the chief characteristic of `
The Haunted Temple	ORGANIZATION	, and Other Poems , ' by Mr ,
Edward Doyle	PERSON	.

		The titular piece is a long com - position in stanzas which embody a sort of alle - gorical vision of the place of lost souls .

		We may best exemplify Mr.
Doyle	PERSON	's poetic quality by means of his sonnet on ' The Jews in
Russia	LOCATION	. ' '

		From town and village to a wood , stript bare , As they of their possessions , see them throng .

		Above them grows a cloud : it moves along , As flee they from the circling wolf pack 's glare .

		Is it the Brocken-Shadow of despair .

		The looming of their life of cruel wrong For countless ages ?

		No ; their faith is strong In their Jehovah ; that huge cloud is prayer .

		A flash of light , and black the despot lies .

		What thunder round the world !

		'T is transport 's strain Proclaiming loud : `` No righteous prayer is vain .

		No God-imploring tears are lost ; they rise Into a cloud , and in the sky remain Till they draw lightning from
Jehovah	ORGANIZATION	's eyes . '' '

		Mr.
Doyle	PERSON	has the misfortune of being blind , for which his inward vision is perhaps all the clearer .

		Last on our list comes a little book , ' From Crypt and Choir , ' by Mr.
Louis Alexander Eob	PERSON	- ertson , whose earlier volumes we have read with much pleasure .

		We quote the preparatory poem , which gives to the volume its title . '

		From crypt and choir these rhymes are penned .

		For grief and gladness in them blend .

		There is a cell beneath Song 's fane Where many a prisoned of pain Hath found the Muse his closest friend .

		Above his couch she comes to bend .

		She teaches him to make and mend The psalm he sues her to obtain From crypt and choir .

		She makes the organ 's thunder rend His raftered roof ; the tones descend And flood the dungeon with their strain ; But unto her he turns to gain The calmer chords she loves to lend From crypt and choir . '

		Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	, besides writing excellent son - nets , easily manipulates the ballads and other intricate forms , and gives us finished verse which often rises to a high level of imagination .

		Early years The Royal Academy of Arts in
Lon	LOCATION	- of the don is a peculiar institution in many Royal ^ cadema/respects .

		It is , to quote the words of a note Avritten by one of its former presidents , * a private institution under the patronage and protection of the king , existing by his will and pleasure , communicating immediately with His Majesty , submitting all its laws and proceedings to his sanction , and responsible only to his Maj - esty for the manner in which its concerns are administered . '

		It is under the control of the crown , yet has to give no account of itself to
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	or to any of the state departments .

		While doing a work of national importance , it has no subsidy from the government .

		If in finan - cial difficulties it might by precedent expect assistance from the sovereign -LRB- it has not received such aid since
1780	DATE	-RRB- but could claim nothing from the
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	.

		The president has access to the king to consult him on all matters affecting the interests of the government of the institution .

		It has been in existence less than a century and a half , but its career has been eminently success - ful .

		By maintaining a free school for art students under the direction of leading artists , it has played a significant part in art education , and it has been for many years recognized as the gov - erning influence in art matters in
England	LOCATION	.

		Although restricted from the beginning in its membership to forty Academicians and twenty
Associates	ORGANIZATION	, there were upon its rolls down to
1904	DATE	the names of a hundred and thirty-five
Academi	PERSON	- cians , -- painters , architects , and sculptors , -- including the most noted names in the annals of British art .

		All these things considered , a his - tory of the
Royal Academy	ORGANIZATION	should be a valuable contribution to the history of art in
England	LOCATION	.

		Such a history was undertaken by the late
J. E. Hodgson	PERSON	,
R.A.	LOCATION	, and
Frederick A. Eaton	PERSON	,
Secre	PERSON	- tary of the Academy , and received further assist - ance subsequent to the death of Mr.
Hodgson	PERSON	from
Charles Leslie	PERSON	,
R.A.	LOCATION	.

		The handsome volume which is the result of this collaboration , ` The
Royal Academy	ORGANIZATION	and its Members , 1768-1830 ^ -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- , although rich in histor - ical material , illustrations ' , and appendices , and containing valuable biographical sketches , fails to give that view of art-development which the reader would naturally be led to expect .

		It gives the annals of the Academy during the adminis - trations of but three of its presidents , Sir
Joshua Reynolds	PERSON	,
Benjamin West	PERSON	, and Sir
Thomas Law	PERSON	- rence , and closes abruptly with the death of Law - rence in
1830	DATE	.

		Its biographical sketches of
Aca	LOCATION	- demicians and
Associates	ORGANIZATION	during those administra - tions tell us more of the lives of their subjects
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 69 than of their art , and confirm the reader in the opinion that the later seventy years of the his - tory of the
Royal Academy	ORGANIZATION	and of British Art , -- the period of
Millais	PERSON	, of
Lord Lei	ORGANIZATION	^ hton , of Akna -
Tadema	LOCATION	, and others , -- is a far more glorious period than that of
Reynolds	PERSON	, of
Gainsborough	LOCATION	, and of
Turner	ORGANIZATION	.

		The chapters relating to the gen - esis of the Academy are not lacking in interest , but it is apparent that the artists of those earlier days did not experience the psalmist 's blessedness of dwelling together in unity , and their petty jeal - ousies and disputes were scarcely worthy of per - petuation in a history related to that of the de - velopment of a nation 's art .

		FitzGeraid Somewhat out of his element , in < u an English a wav that is half - amusing , half - man of letters , pathetic , must
Edward FitzGeraid	PERSON	appear to his friends when they see him clothed in the uniform of the ` English Men of Letters ' series -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Judged by English-men-of - letters standards , he was bound to receive some rather hard knocks ; and Mr.
A. C. Benson	PERSON	, his biographer , has not spared him .

		Anything like hearty praise is accorded only to the Omar quatrains and the Letters , and in that order .

		Apart from his one masterpiece of translation , or paraphrase , poor
E. F. G.	PERSON	is sharply called to order for taking such liberties with the works of others , -- works for the understanding of which Mr.
Benson	PERSON	questions the translator 's philological equipment .

		While not unappreciative of
Fitz	PERSON	- Geraid 's unique quality , the author indulges in regrets that he had not done this or that , or been something other than he was .

		* It is to be wished , ' he says , referring to the early love - affair with
Caroline Crabbe	PERSON	, ` that this romance had had a normal ending . '

		But what likelihood of any Rubaiyat or Letters from a normalized family-man FitzGeraid ?

		Regret is expressed , or implied here and there , that FitzGeraid had not the energy to rouse himself from his dilettante - ism , his gentle pessimism , his dreamy inactivity .

		The foibles were , in this case , of the very essence of the man .

		Mr.
Benson	PERSON	is now and then self - contradictory .

		We are told that though
Fitz	PERSON	- Geraid admired his friends generously , * he also took severe account of their faults .

		He did not think a friend a poet because he happened to write verses , or an artist because he painted pictures . '

		Yet we read elsewhere that he ` started with a predisposition to admire the work of those he loved , not only for its intrinsic mer - its , but because it was a part of them ' ; and ` it is
ob %	PERCENT	- ious that FitzGeraid 's later A * iews of Car - lyle , and even of his writings , were much modi - fied by their friendship . '

		Again , ` the unpardon - able sins to FitzGeraid were uncouthness and slovenliness ' ; but later slovenliness is designated as one of his primary failings , and ` it was not a superficial sloppiness ; it penetrated the mind and character as well . '

		Of the translator 's excuse for certain omissions in the ` CEdipus Tyrannus , ' Mr.
Benson	PERSON	says , ` the defence would only be valid if FitzGeraid had thrown the plot over - board and constructed a play of his own on the same plot , ' -- a puzzling combination of rejection and retention .

		A good illustration of the way tradition grows occurs in the description of
John FitzGeraid	PERSON	, of whom we read that ` when he preached , or even when he listened to sermons , he was accustomed to remove certain articles of dress , such as boots and stockings ... to make himself quite comfortable . '

		This appears to be an amplification of Mr.
Thomas Wright	PERSON	's statement that as a preliminary to his pulpit dis - course the eccentric preacher ' would even remove a boot . '

		This new life of FitzGeraid , of whom we already have two biographies , not to mention the autobiographic Letters , meets no crying need .

		The literary strictures , however just , seem not exactly called for in ` Old Fitz 's ' case ; and all else is a twice-told tale .

		Chapters on Mr.
Frank Preston Stearns	PERSON	's pleas -
Neu	PERSON	-RRB-
England	LOCATION	ant collection of `
Cambridge	LOCATION	celebrities .

		Sketches ' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- contains many true things that are not new and doubt - less do not aim at novelty , and also some new things that are not true however unintentional their falsity .

		For example , the author says of
Lowell	LOCATION	that in the law ` he succeeded as well as youthful attorneys commonly do , ' and that dur - ing the ten years following his marriage to Maria White ` he worked hard and lived economically , earning what he could by the law , and what he could not by magazine writing . '

		But
Scudder	ORGANIZATION	gives a very different account , which
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	's published letters tend to confirm .

		The young poet seems never to have entered seriously on the practice of the law , and we are distinctly told that in those first months of his married life -- the winter he and
Maria	PERSON	spent in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	-- his only earnings were from his pen , and that on his return to
Cambridge	LOCATION	the next
summer	DATE	he abandoned all pretense of following the law .

		Again , we read , ` The trochaic metre in which `` Hiawatha '' is written would seem to have been his -LSB-
Longfellow	LOCATION	's -RSB- own invention . '

		Surely Mr.
Steams	PERSON	has not forgotten the critics ' senseless outcry against
Longfellow	PERSON	for appropriating metre as well as incidents from the ` Kalevala , ' That the Finnish epic suggested the metre , the American poet made no secret .

		Of Longfellow it is further said , ` As a master of verse he has no English rival since
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	' -- which at least the Tennysonians wiU dispute .

		A centennial tribute to
Bronson Alcott	PERSON	records among other things that ` to the last he would never touch animal food . '

		But Mrs.
Rebecca Harding Davis	PERSON	has recently told us , in her ` Bits of Gossip , ' with what hearty relish the good man attacked a sir - loin of beef at
Hawthorne	LOCATION	's table , as a prelude to the praises of vegetarianism .

		The chapter on Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	asserts that ` the essence of humor consists in a contrast which places the object or person compared at a disadvantage . '

		Is not this rather sarcasm , or ridicule ?

		Humor , which
Thackeray	PERSON	defines as a mixture of love and wit , is not primarily ill-natured .

		The author is not quite careful enough in his grammar .

		He writes , ` It is doubtful if Cranch ever laid awake over his work . '

		and , speaking of one of Cranch 's land - scapes , ' I think it must have been painted an - to THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, terior to his sojourn in
Rome	LOCATION	. '

		` Anteriorly to ' would have been grammatically correct ; but why this strange contortion when * before ' is all that is meant ?

		` An Italian lazzaroni ' astonishes the reader -- in the ` Leaves from a Roman Diary , ' too .

		Misprints are numerous .

		At the bottom of page 329 there is a hopeless muddle involving several lines .

		While the book contains much agreeable reading matter and a number of good portraits , its chapter on
George L. Stearns	PERSON	, the author 's father , is its only noteworthy contribu - tion to biography .

		A readable volume on One of the latest additions to the ` English Men of Letters ' series
Thomas Moore	PERSON	.

		-LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is Mr.
Stephen Gwynn	PERSON	's volume on
Thomas Moore	PERSON	.

		In style and lucidity of exposition , the book amply sustains the char - acter of the well-known series edited by Mr.
John Morley	PERSON	.

		The author has succeeded well in pre - senting the poet 's engaging personality .

		For this he has drawn freely upon
Moore	PERSON	's own writ - ings and correspondence and the letters of con - temporaries .

		We are given a satisfactory view of the poet 's domestic life , his relations with his publishers , in which he is always a model of honor , and his relations with the public men of his day .

		Among these ,
Lord John Russell	PERSON	, who became Prime Minister in
1847	DATE	, five years before
Moore	PERSON	's death , was perhaps the poet 's most inti - mate friend and his chief biographer .

		Mr.
Gwynn	PERSON	's book is compact with information and well-balanced criticism .

		During the poet 's life - time his lyric verse was in great vogue .

		This was true of the ` Odes of Anacreon , ' his first pub - lished work , as well as of the much more famous Irish Melodies .

		The poet 's personal magnetism had much to do with the popularity of his verse .


Moore	PERSON	travelled much , and was a social favorite .

		He was a charming singer of his own Irish songs .

		But the fatal fluency of his composition stamped the seal of transitoriness upon much that he wrote .

		Outside of the ` Irish Melodies , ' he wrote very little lyric verse that has not already evapor - ated .

		Mr.
Gwynn	PERSON	attributes the fading of ` Lalla Rookh , '
Moore	PERSON	's most pretentious poetic effort , to ` work done against the grain , and relying for its success on the secondary qualities of elaborate finish , profusion of ornament , and variety of interest . '

		The development of his interest in themes requiring prose treatment wrought a depressing effect upon his muse .

		His prose taste turned in the direction of biography , and he wrote successful lives of
Sheridan	PERSON	,
Byron	PERSON	, and
Lord Fitzgerald	PERSON	, the famous Irish revolutionist .

		He wrote also a four-volume history of
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		His life of
Byron	PERSON	, says Mr.
Gwynn	PERSON	, has ` been more read than any biography in the language , with the single exception of
Boswell 's	ORGANIZATION	. '

		The ` Gen - eral Appreciation , ' forming Mr.
Gwynn	PERSON	's last chapter , is a good piece of literary criticism .


Moore	PERSON	's originality as a metrical artist is given as his chief distinction in poetry .

		His skill in rhythmical invention and stanzaic variety is shown in the remarkable success with which he reproduced Irish folk-songs in English metre .

		Interesting side-lights are thrown on
Moore	PERSON	's relations with
Byron	PERSON	,
Scott	PERSON	, and
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Gwynn	PERSON	's volume shows a well-proportioned use of his abundant materials , and he has given a sincere and readable study of a very interesting poetic personality .

		A complete bibliography of
Moore	ORGANIZATION	's works is a valuable feature of the book .

		An interesting Mr.
George Alexander Fischer	PERSON	has ' character-study given US a new character-study of of
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	.

		Beethoven -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- which is perhaps the most rational , convincing , shrewd , and sympathetic estimate yet made .

		It is a valuable book to the student of music , for its brilliancy as well as its depth of analysis , besides its mass of information .

		The author shows us that
Beethoven	PERSON	is the ` philosopher of music , ' that in his work the philosophic spirit comes to the fore , and that his genius as a musician is affili - ated with a broad mental scope , an altruistic spirit , which enabled him to address the intellect of mankind .

		The events and influences of his life , and their part in determining the character of his compositions , are followed throughout his career , so that Mr.
Fischer	PERSON	's work becomes at once a biography and a musical criticism .

		As a corollary , he outlines
Wagner	PERSON	's indebtedness to Beethoven : `
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	, in
Wagner	PERSON	's estimation , is a landmark in music , just as
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is in literature , as Jesus or Buddha in religion .

		He is the central figure ; all others are but radii emanating from him .

		To
Beethoven	PERSON	was it given to express clearly what the others could but dimly perceive .

		The relation of men like
Bach	PERSON	or Handel toward
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	,
Wagner	PERSON	held to be analogous to that of the prophets toward Jesus ; namely , one of expectancy .

		The art reached its culmination in
Beethoven	LOCATION	.

		This is
Wagner	PERSON	's summary of the significance of
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	's work , and he pi'oclaimed it continually from the house - tops .

		It was in some sort a religious exercise to him to make propaganda for the master to whom he felt himself so deeply indebted .

		The burden of his utterances on the subject of the musician 's art is , `` A greater than I exists .

		It is Beet - hoven . '' '


Wagner	PERSON	's achievement , according to Mr.
Fischer	PERSON	, can be attributed in part to a certain quality of intellectual receptivity , by virtue of Avhich he was enabled to appropriate to himself the genius of the two of his predecessors for whom he had a special affinity , -- Shakespeare and
Beethoven	PERSON	, who served him as models .

		Classical A new contribution to the discus - revivai in sion of Classical Training comes Education .

		from the
Knickerbocker Press	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- Put - nam -RRB- in the form of five collected addresses by Professor
Sidney G. Ashmore	PERSON	, of Union Col - lege .

		The plea is to the general reader , with the aim of persuading him to devote some part of his time , however small , ` to upholding the interests of a cause that is without doubt a losing one just at the present time . '

		As this is a scientific age .

		Professor
Ashmore	PERSON	seeks to put his argu - ment on a scientific basis .

		The results of the investigation of specialists in education , he main - tains , ` justify the inference that mental growth and expansion are conditioned by , and are
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 71 directly dependent on , the development of the brain ; that each form of mental activity has its origin in those nerve centres of the brain which are expressly assigned by nature to the function or activity in question ; that the development of the concept centres is greatly aided through the foimal study of language , and that the language most admirably suited to this purpose is Latin . '

		Under the freedom of the elective sj-stem so widely prevalent at present , we are not quite sure that such an argument can have much to do with determining the proportion of any given class which shall elect Latin .

		A demonstration that the Latin section of any g ^ ven class will develops a larger propoi ` tion of successful quar - ter-backs , pitchers , etc. , would be much more likely to show practical results in the direction of the author 's purpose .

		He is certainly right in his opinion that the Latin is preeminently a log - ical language , and fitted to develope the logical faculty in those who study it ; but we are not quite sure that Latin teachers generally secure results in this line at all commensurate with the possibilities .

		Perhaps the newly-formed
Classical Association of the Middle West and South	ORGANIZATION	, with its avowed intention to get nearer to the work of the teacher than has been the ease with the
American Philological Association	ORGANIZATION	, is to be the medium of a genuine Classical revival .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Mr.
B. H. Blackwell	PERSON	,
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, publishes ` Byways in the Classics , ' by Mr.
Hugh E. P. Piatt	PERSON	.

		This is a reproduction -LRB- with much additional matter -RRB- of Mr.
Piatt	PERSON	's little book of a year or so ago entitled ` Alia . '

		It consists of jottings from the note-book of a lover of the classics , and includes a great many Greek and Latin parallels to modern proverbial and colloquial phrases , besides mottoes for various uses , and an interesting collection of classical quotations in modern political oratory .

		The book is a medley , of course , but one in which scholars will delight , and which they will also find useful as a treasure-house of apt illustrations for literary uses .

		` The Gray Brethren , and Other Fragments in Prose and Verse , ' published by
Messrs. E. P. Button & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is a posthumous book by the writer who called herself `
Michael Fairless	PERSON	, ' and who was chiefly known by two books called ` The Koad - mender ' and ` The Gathering of Brother Hilarius . '

		The present volume , like its predecessors , is marked by an exquisite simplicity of diction and a delicacy of spiritual insight that are far out of the common .

		Its contents consist of short stories , sketches , and bits of verse , with a group of four fairy-tales at the end .

		The story of ` The Dreadful
Griffin	PERSON	' is one of the very nicest fairy tales that we have ever read .

		NOTES 94 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 94 LITERARY PERSPECTIVE .

		We have been a good deal surprised to notice that the reviewers of current literature , in newspapers and even in professedly literary Journals , have very generally discussed Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	's ' Xaturalism in
England	LOCATION	' as if it were a new book .

		We have seen it receive column after column of comment , bestowing praise or censure according to the whim of the I particular writer , but saying not a word to indi - cate the fact that the book is now thirty years old .

		In a few instances , this neglect is prob - ably due to sheer ignorance ; in the others , it must be set down to a hazy notion that bring - ing an old foreign book to the attention of the English public somehow makes it a new one .

		Similarly , we have just had heralded as a new book , and will soon have reviewed as such , Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's novelette in epistolary form , called * A Year 's Letters , ' and published serially as far back as
1877	DATE	, as all Swinbumians know .

		In this case , there seems to have been a deliberate attempt to deceive the public into expecting a newly-written book instead of the reprint of an old one .

		Leaving aside the question of ethics which is raised by these misleading practices , there is a critical question involved in them of the first importance .

		The time has long gone by when it was thought that a piece of literature might be adequately discussed hy the application of abstract principles without making any refer - ence to the circumstances under which it was produced .

		Taine taught us the futility of that proceeding very thoroughly , even if himself blind to other necessary aspects of criticism .

		How ridiculous then it is to discuss the book of Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	, itself only an intermediate section of a larger treatise , without allowing all the time for the fact that it was the work of an impetuous young man , written from the point of view of
Continental	ORGANIZATION	radicalism , and at a date when the period of English literature with which it deals had not been taken up in any adequate kind of way by critics to the manner bom .

		Examined in the light of these facts , the book becomes illuminating ; if they are ignored , it misses its proper effect .

		And so with Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's satirical presentment of English society in the mid - Victorian period , the reader who does not keep constantly in mind the time of its writing and the age of its writer will find it to have little meaning .

		Yet we expect during the next few weeks to read many reviews of the book making no mention of these essential facts , and open to the implication , at least , of assuming that it offers a view of pres - ent-day society as mirrored in the mind of a sage of seventy or thereabouts .

		It is necessary , not only for the understand - ing of a book , but also for its enjoyment , to take into account the time , place , and mUieu of its production .

		This is the formula which 78 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	,
Taine	PERSON	gave us , and the process may be more succinctly designated as viewing the book in perspective .

		It is true that some works , by the universality of their appeal , by their foun - dation upon the eternal verities of the spiritual life , may make a direct and powerful impres - sion upon the untutored mind , and seem to have little need of historical illumination .

		Un - schooled adults , and even children , may feel much of the truth and beauty of
Isaiah	LOCATION	, or of Homer , or of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, for to this truth many autobiographies and confessions bear wit - ness .

		In such books , soul speaks to soul , eschewing the intermediary of the trained and critical intellect ; the utterance , for its essential message , might be that of a contemporary .

		Nevertheless , it must be allowed that the seri - ous student , even of these universal books , gets a far fuller and richer comprehension of their contents , and a reward in proportion to the extent of his historical realization of their origin .

		In a word , the truer the perspective in which he views them , the better is he prepared to sound their meaning and sympathize with the life which they portray .

		It may be urged , per contra , that a naive joy in the masterpieces of world-literature is more genuine than one that comes from conscious study , and there is no doubt that the edgie of appreciation may be dulled by too curious an inquiry into particulars .

		This process , in gain - ing one perspective , runs the risk of losing an - other .

		If it be carried to the point of pedantry -- and the danger of carrying it that far is by no means imaginary in these days of a
Teuton	LOCATION	- ized higher education -- the student of litera - ture will lose sight of the wood for the trees , and the trees will prove to be a particularly thorny and repellant growth of linguistics , and archaeology , and philosophical phrase-monger - ing .

		To change our metaphor , the one who studies literature in this spirit will be apt to miss its flower , and find , when he would pluck it , that it has gone to seed .

		A better reward than this may be had with far less of applica - tion and wearisome constraint .

		But this consideration does not seriously im - pair our original thesis , which is that the satis - factions , intellectual , aesthetic , and ethical , ob - tainable from the great productions of literature are immeasurably enhanced by the cultivation of that historical sense which alone makes it possible to view these productions in their right relations .

		The thing to avoid is the micro - scopic habit , not the general broadening of vision .

		One can not know too much about
Isaiah	PERSON	, or Homer , or
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, but the knowledge must be interpreted in a large and liberal fashion , the fashion of
Arnold	LOCATION	, or of
Symonds	LOCATION	, or of
Swinburne	LOCATION	.

		And it must be knowledge of the sort that goes to the making of CuUurgeschichte , not of the sort that leads to the multiplication of monographs by German specialists .

		If our general position is sound as far as it concerns the great prophetic and poetic voices of humanity , whose speech , in some sense , transcends the bounds of time and space , how much more cogent must the argument be when applied to writers of more temporal influence and fame .

		With such writers the pressure of the time counts for so much that unless we take it somewhat fully into account their work is almost unintelligible , or at least so alien to our modern ways of thinking as to seem life - less .

		To take a few examples from English literature alone , how much we must read be - tween the lines , how much we must know of past political and social conditions , of intel - lectual outlook and literary fashion , to perceive the glow of vitality in such writers as Spenser and
Donne	PERSON	, as
Dryden	PERSON	and Swift , or even to feel the ardor with which the eager spirits of the later eighteenth century hailed the dawn of the revolutionary epoch .

		The springs whence flowed the power of these writers are sealed to us unless we have in some degree placed our - selves abreast the general stream of tendency to which their ideals were affluent .

		We might put the case in a very concrete form by asking why
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	thought so much of
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	.

		His enthusiastic devotion to the Rector of
Trowbridge	ORGANIZATION	was certainly more than a whim or a personal idiosyncrasy , and as certainly it was not due to the pride of dis - covery or exploitation which impels a certain type of critic to make , as Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	puts it , ' a remarkably dull Italian into a god , and great but not rationally great Frenchman into a compound of Shakespeare and
Plato	ORGANIZATION	. '

		The real answer to the question must be , of course , that
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	, partly on account of his per - sonal relations with the poet 's family , and partly on account of his intimate knowledge of
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	's life and circumstances , and of the as - pects of the old English life that he depicted with such minute truth and marvellous fidelity , was enabled to view his work with a sympa - thetic understanding utterly impossible to the casual reader , and thus to penetrate to the innermost secret of its vitality .

		This illustration of the comprehension of literature that comes from seeing it in its proper perspective may be paralleled in many other cases .

		It explains to us
Charles Lamb	PERSON	's delight in Elizabethan dramatists and seven - teenth century worthies ,
William Morris	PERSON	's joy in mediaeval romance , and
Austin Dobson	PERSON	's ap - preciation of the artificial writings of the eight - eenth century .

		It explains also the interest

		THE DIAL .

		79 which the most obscure and neglected of poets may acquire in the eyes of the modem editor and commentator , who makes it his business , not to discuss him in the dry light of abstract criticism , but to view him in his habit as he lived .

		It may be said that there are three main elements in the appreciation of literature .

		There is first the aesthetic element , which asks for nothing more than sheer beaut -RRB- ' of expression .

		Then there is the ethical element , which re - quires wisdom to be concealed within the form of beauty , and has ever an eye to the bearing of literature upon conduct .

		Finally , there is the historical element , which if we bring also to our study , may not only enhance the other two , but may provide us with an additional pleasure of its own .

		And this pleasure , although not the deepest that literature affords , is prob - ably the one easiest of access and most widely realized , for it lies well within the reach of those whose senses are imperfectly attuned to the finer manifestations of the poetic spirit .

		COMMUXICA TIONS .

		AMERICAN AND ENGLISH COLLEGE TRAINING .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The DiAii . -RRB-

		Will you allow me a few words touching the I -RRB- osition of Mr.
Xixon	PERSON	on
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	education , as set forth in the leading article in your issue of
July 16	DATE	, and the comments thereon by
Colonel Higginson	PERSON	in your issue of
August 1	DATE	.

		It seems to me that there is a fundamental difference be - tween the \ - iew-point of our young Americans at
Oxford	LOCATION	, and that of Colonel
Higginson	PERSON	; and I am strengthened in this belief by reading letters from a Rhodes beneficiary who is a fellow-towns - man .

		I think that our young men at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	are dealing less with education in the strict let - ter sense than with educational literary reading ; while
Colonel Higginson	PERSON	sees only the rigid let - ter .

		They talk of what Englishmen know of
Dante	PERSON	and his times ; and
Colonel Higginson	PERSON	tells us how readily he can find well-equipped translators of French and Spanish .

		But these differing views are certainly to be expected , be - cause they are the views of persons of differ - ing periods of time .

		No man by taking thought can so add to his mental stature as to give him a generation-wide view in front , and an equal range behind ; and the age qualification cuts off the view of the young men over the backward road .

		But to be more concrete .

		It is the belief of many of us that the education of the average American college man is scrimj -RRB- ed in general history ; and this being the case , he lacks some - thing like a keel to his literary ship .

		I will not try to elaborate this , for it would take too much space , and probably it is unnecessary ; but if I say that those who have little knowledge of a past age will , as a rule , take little interest in the human products of that age , I shall outline my meaning .

		But if this be so , whose fault is it ?

		That of the American age , which wants to see the end straight ahead on the track , or else will not bother with the means .

		Education that does not lead by the shortest and best-lighted road to a definite object is called merely education for education 's sake , and the young American will have none of it .

		To put in his storehouse a stock of mental goods that he merely may want , and is not sure to want , is to him a waste of both time and storage .

		And in the last analysis it is but too often foimd that the mental goods must have a market value in dollars .

		To this literally golden vision the p -RRB- oor college can op - pose only a protest ; for everybody is stronger -LRB- not wiser -RRB- than anybody , and the millions be - heve in the vision .

		But yet this better knowledge of history is practical enough , if only it is carefully consid - ered ; and the practical Englishman knows it .

		Without it , there is no straight-edge by which to measure great impending events .

		When the Spanish war was on , the man who knew not his - tory talked of tons and guns , and showed us that our navy was but little stronger than the other ; but the man of historic knowledge quietly said that if we could so maul the Eng - lish in
1812	DATE	, and if the English in turn had beaten the French , and if these again were cer - tain ^ better sea-fighters than the Spanish , why , imless the advance of mechanics had been in
Spain	LOCATION	's favor rather than ours , we ought to beat .

		It had n't , and we accordingly ought to have won ' hands down ' ; and we did so win .

		Let us listen , then , to the discoveries our Rhodes men are making with respect and rea - sonable credence .

		We are sure they are honest , and they are talking from things learned on the spot .

		PAUL JONES AS A HERO IN FICTION .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Diau -RRB- At this period of reawakened interest in
Paul Jones	PERSON	and his services for
America	LOCATION	, it may be fitting to recall that when
Fenimore Cooper	PERSON	decided to write a romance of the sea , more than eighty years ago , he chose as his hero and mysterious ` Pilot ' this adventurous ` Man without a Country . '

		The cruise of ` The Ranger ' and the subsequent events in the life of
Paul Jones	PERSON	, inter - woven with fanciful episodes , gave plot to this first American story of the sea .

		` The Pilot , ' as fiction , has the faults of prolixity and unevenness found in all of
Cooper	ORGANIZATION	's work ; but it contains two or three vigorous passages of shipwreck and storm that have not been surpassed in later tales of nautical adventure .

		In the mystery-shrouded Pilot of the -LRB- jrerman Ocean , guiding in safety the `
Ariel	ORGANIZATION	' amid shoals and reefs , and assisting with shrewd daring in the clandestine mission of the American frigate ,
Cooper	PERSON	has made a viWd character , with distinguishing features of manner ^ 0 THE DIAL , -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, and dress which carefully conform to the histor - ical
Paul Jones	PERSON	.

		Amid the excitement of oflBcers and crew , he keeps his unruffled aspect of authority , ` like a man who not only felt that everything depended upon himself , but that he was equal to the emergency . '

		The occasional passages of .

		introduction in the earlier chapters expand , as the story progresses , by both direct and subtle allusions , to a portrayal of the violent yet restrained passions of the man , his wild ambitions and fierce resentments , and his roman - tic and often distorted conceptions of glory .

		Cooper 's
Paul Jones	PERSON	is a strong character , with sufficient mystery to sustain and enhance the interest of the story .

		The intrusion of a romance in his life , and the love-passages , do not add to the vigor of the portraiture , but they do produce a medium through which the hero attempts to vindicate his tragic and seemingly treasonous career .

		As
Alice Dunscombe	PERSON	reproaches her lover with disloyalty to the land of his birth , she only repeats the censure which his own time and later years have uttered against this man whose marvellous prowess and ambition were perverted from their legitimate service and rewards .

		In answer to her condemnation ,
Paul Jones	PERSON	makes his defense to posterity : ` My name has been sounded , and that in no gentle strains , when a whole people have quailed at it , -- the craven , cowardly wretches flying before the man they had wronged .

		I have lived to bear the banner of the new Republic proudly in sight of the three kingdoms , when practised skill and equal arms have in vain struggled to pluck it down .

		Full twenty times have I met the hirelings of your prince in open battle , fighting ever manfully un - der that flag which was first raised to the breeze by my own hands , and which , I thank my God , I have never seen lowered an inch ; but with no one act of cowardice or private wrong in all that ser - vice can I reproach myself ; and yet , how am I rewarded ?

		The tongue of the vile calumniator is keener than the sword of the warrior , and leaves a more indelible scar .

		Envy and jealousy robbed me of my just dues and of more than half my glory .

		They call me pirate !

		If I have claim to the name , it was furnished by the paltry outfit of my friends rather than by any act towards my enemies ! '

		There seems almost specific forecast of this day of rehabilitation of his character in the hero 's later words : ` The truth must be finally known ; and when that hour shall come , they will say , he was a faithful and gallant warrior in his day .

		... Think you that there are not pens as well as swords in
America	LOCATION	?

		It is a country that can form a world of itself ; and why should they who inherit it look to other nations for their laws ? '

		Many words of discriminating analysis have been spoken and writen upon this adventurer in the few weeks of revived interest in his grave and his memory .

		One may question , however , if a more just estimate of his character can be cited than the final tribute of
Cooper	ORGANIZATION	, through the words of
Griffith	PERSON	, when he learns of the death of his former pilot : ' His devotion to
America	LOCATION	pro- ceeded from desire of distinction , his ruling passion , and perhaps a little also from resentment of some injustice which he claimed to have suffered from his own countrymen ; -- had he lived in times and under circumstances when his con - summate knowledge of his profession , his cool , deliberate and even desperate courage could have been exercised in a regular and well-supported navy , and had the habits of his youth better fitted him to have borne meekly the honors he acquired in his age , he would have left behind him no name , in its lists , that would have descended to the latest posterity of his adopted countrymen with greater renown .

		THE DIAL .

		81 of stiff-necked conservatism and of vested in - terests , and the taunts and sneers of ignorance and malice , our rector became a radical parson , the cart-tail and the platform his week-day pul - pit , and the subjoined his main heads of dis - course , as summarized at the close of his book , where he points out the six tasks confronting English political reformers at the present time : * 1 .

		AGBARiA ^ f Reform .

		Only land nationalisa - tion can relieve the congested towns , bring back the villager to the village , utilise the millions of unproductive acres in which aurum irrepertum undiscovered gold , is laid up for the spade which shall extract it .

		2 .

		Electoral jlSD PARLLi.iiEXTABY Reform .

		Manhood and womanhood adult suffrage ; the single and simultaneous vote , payment of mem - bers , abolition of the
House of Lords	ORGANIZATION	.

		3 .

		Labottr Reform .

		Organisation of labour bureaux ; the Con - spiracy Act amended ; employers ' liability increased ; inspectors , male and female , multiplied ; compulsory arbitration -LRB- as a counsel of perfection if not an immediate enactment -RRB- ; a minimum wage ; an eight-hours labour day .

		4 .

		Local GovEBXMEJfr Reform , The parish councils reconstituted ; unpail magistrates swept away ;
London	LOCATION	unified .

		5 ,
Ecclesiastical Reform	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Church of
England	LOCATION	dis - established and disendowed .

		6 .

		Home Rule for
Ireland	LOCATION	; possible now , perhaps , for the first time since Mr.
Parnell	PERSON	's retirement . '

		Comment on the foregoing is not here called for , although some of the measures advocated , especially land-nationalization and a minimum wage , must seem to many either undesirable or impracticable or both .

		Experiments with his own villagers on his own glebe , in the face of stupid episcopal oppo sition , and a tour through agricultural
France	LOCATION	, where the land monopolist is unknown since the French Kevolution , demonstrated the prac - ticability of some sort of agrarian reform , if not of his own pet scheme .

		Here a passage from the book itself will set forth some of the things made clear by this experiment in small farming .

		The lots cultivated , it should be re - membered , were only two-acre , one-acre , and half-acre patches of what had before been prac - tically waste land , and were rented at one pound sterling per acre .

		* `` When the land had been worked for two and a half years , it seemed time to make public the results .

		In
September , 1888	DATE	, we held a harvest home tea and prize-giving .

		The tenants and their wives sate down on the Rectory lawn , one hundred and twenty in number , to a substantial meal , in a large tent prettily decorated , and flaunting
Maz	PERSON	- zini 's motto , '' For God and the people . ''

		Four prizes in money were given to the best tilled allot - ments in the fields at present broken up , the judge , manager of a neighboring farm , congratulating the labourers generally on the surprising excellence of their crops and the cleanliness of the land .

		1 pointed out to our visitors , first , that they had seen acres waving with splendid corn which three years before had been a wilderness ; the profit going , not to the landlord or the middleman , but straight into the pockets of the industrious labour - ers who created it ; and , secondly , that before their eyes were instances not a few , in which working men had in their spare time , and with their wives ' help , cultivated as much as two acres of ground , saving thereon from 15 1 .

		to 18 1 .

		a year . '

		Elsewhere reference is made to the immensely increased productiveness of land thus cultivated as compared with its tillage by Mred labor .

		Before this , Mr.
Tuckwell	PERSON	had been deeply interested in the extension of the franchise , and had taken an active part in ihe first gen - eral election -LRB- 1885 -RRB- under the new law .

		A curious and most unexpected bit of Jesuitic casuistry occurs at this point .

		The balloting was to be by the now well-known Australian system ; but the newly-enfranchised were in many instances terrorized in advance and com - pelled to sign pledges that they would vote for Conservative candidates .

		Learning that this was being done in his own district , our author counselled the voters accordingly . '

		Parlia - ment , ' he told them in a printed leaflet , ` has ordained that all votes shall be secret ; that no man shall know how any one else has voted ; and your duty is to carry out this law and to keep your secret faithfully .

		And if you have signed a paper or given a promise , not under - standing this to be the case , I tell you that your signature and your promise go for nothing , and that your vote is , by the law of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, still your own , to use as you think best .

		The Bible says , `` Answer a fool according to his folly '' ; and so when any fool who can injure you if you refuse him asks you to sign a paper , I say , '' Sign it '' ; to give a promise , I say , '' Give it . ''

		But remember , that signature and promise both go absolutely for nothing , as be - ing unfairly and illegally obtained , and that your vote remains your own . '

		The little tract containing this advice to voters was widely cir - culated , copied approvingly or disapprovingly by many papers , translated into Welsh , versified and set to the tune of ' LiUibullero , ' and even published in American and Australian news - papers , thus being printed to the extent of sev - eral hundred thousand copies . '

		Looking back calmly , ' writes the author , ` after the lapse of nearly twenty years on the long-forgotten con - troversy as regards its moral justification , I profess ' myself unconvinced that I was wrong , in the exceptional circumstances which evoked it .

		That a majority at the time condemned me was due to the unreasoning dislike of casuistry - which afSicts popular intelligence , and its con - fused ideas as to the nature and fundamental basis of morality .

		Non enim quidquid morale est honos mores facit . '

		But perhaps the com - mon instinct against telling an untruth or breaking a promise is not so ver -RCB- * far wrong , after all .

		The little ante-election tract that thus fared so far abroad is given in an appen -

		The popular favor accorded to Mr.
Tuck	PERSON	- well 's oratorical efforts appears to have been warm from first to last .

		So well did he know how to touch the hearts and stir the enthusiasm of his humbler hearers that at Manchester a fervid admirer rose to declare , in
Hibernian	LOCATION	accents , that if the parson was not an Irish - man he must have been bom out of his native country .

		How the good rector 's parish duties were discharged amid all this travelling and speaking , and this personal investigation of so - cial evils , we are given no hint .

		Evidently he regarded the collective English poor as his parishioners ; for he says : ' The misery which I encountered haunted me with a sense of guilt ; I was ill at ease and self-reproachful unless when labouring to remove it .

		I came to under - stand the Pauline restlessness : '' Woe is me if I preach not the gospel '' -- the gospel of dis - content and reform -- to these poor spirits in prison . '

		The wretched condition of a poor lad in
England	LOCATION	, as contrasted with the cheery lot and hopeful outlook of a young French peasant , is well depicted in the following : * The English lad spends all his earnings ; there is no inducement for him to save .

		If he puts by 40 1. , he can only invest it in the savings bank , and gain from it 1 1 .

		a year .

		There is no excite - ment in 1 1 .

		a year .

		It does not stimulate to the rigid self-denial and economy involved in saving 40 1 .

		out of 12 s. a week .

		He marries early .

		Why should he wait ?

		He will be quite as miserable ten years hence as he is to-day .

		So at one or two and twenty he takes to himself a shiftless , untrained , penniless oloven ; and at thirty , when tiie French peasant gains his Eachel after more vhan seven years of service , the Englishman 's unkempt home is crowded with unfortunate children , to be dragged up , not brought up , on the unincreasing maximum of 12 s. a week .

		Naturally the youth of spirit , beginning life , and surveying these conditions all around him , leaves the country for the town .

		But grant him an acre of land , his own , as the park and mansion are the squire 's own , so long as he pays the rent ; he will at once begin to create upon it , as my allotment holders found that they could create 10 1 .

		to 11 1 .

		a year ; will increase his take , build a cottage on it through a building society , marry by-and-by a sensible thrifty girl , who under - stands marketing , needlework , cooking , washing ; who brings her savings to add to his , and by her management of bees , poultry , fruit , adds ten or eleven shillings a week to the income .

		He will extend his acreage till he becomes a farmer and abandons wage-work , or he will live in a home that is comfortable and his own , with money accumu - lating in the bank as a provision for old age and sickness .

		He will stand up alongside of the French - man upon equal terms , instead of blasting like a mildewed ear the presentment of his wholesome brother . '

		A prophecy with which the book draws to a close tells us that ' there will be two parties in the future : the Tory , who in personal interest and defence of class , struggles to retain pre - rogative and supremacy ; the
Eadical	LOCATION	, who in the interest of the community , and from
Chris	PERSON	- tian motive , seeks to annihilate privilege , to end oppression , to confer upon suffering millions an equal chance of elevation and redemption .

		Between these two the Liberal has no place ; the name can survive only as a shelter to the lukewarm and half-hearted ; in the day of battle its wearers will be repudiated , alike by Eadicals and Tories , as ^ sop 's beasts and birds united to thrust out the bats . '

		He adds to this interesting and not unhopeful vaticination , that the idealist turned cynic is a mournful spec - tacle , and that for his part he means to die as he has lived , an optimist .

		The combination of scholarly polish , graceful wit , and hard common sense in the author of this veracious and on the whole convincing narrative , is very pleasing .

		This Oxford don of the
Toynbee	PERSON	type -LRB- except that
Toynbee	PERSON	was vehemently opposed to land-nationalization -RRB- appeals most winningly to the reader from the opening of the book to its close .

		Especially pleasing and encouraging to those of middle age and beyond is the success with which Mr.
Tuckwell	PERSON	took up , comparatively late in life , what might seem to have been an uncongenial task .

		This openness to new impressions and hopefulness of new achievement can not be too heartily commended .

		What is called the for - mation of character is too often simply the ignominous surrender to temperamental inertia , or the hopeless confinement of one 's interests and activities to one or two narrow channels .


Herbert Spencer	PERSON	's intellectual and scientific preoccupations early rendered him about as little susceptible to a large class of emotional and ajsthetic appeals , including the romantic passion , as a scalene triangle .

		Darwin delib - erately and , one almost adds , sinfully starved to death his love of poetry and of belles-lettres in general .

		And so we applaud our
Radical Parson	ORGANIZATION	for his many-sidedness , progressiveness , and wide-awake open-mindedness .

		His volim - tary labors in behalf of suffering humanity brought him into contact with many public men of note , and his recollections of some of these form a very agreeable feature of his book .

		The only thing one might perhaps regret in the whole volume is that he has adorned it with a frontispiece portrait of himself .

		Not that we are sorry to make acquaintance with his honest , alert , shrewd , inquiring face ; but somehow , in the case of a living author , we are content to read his likeness in the printed page .

		How - ever , the publisher may be responsible in this instance , and one of the author 's stories cer - tainly demands the portrait to give it point .

		J THE DIAL 8 '' The BEGixxrxGS of Our Xatioxal .

		History .

		* If a soft answer turneth away wrath , surely a pleasant introduction predisposes one to en - joy a book .

		To invite the reader to the first volume of his ' History of the
United States	LOCATION	/ Professor Channing could hardly have found a more delightful bit of our mother-English than these quaint sentences which he draws from Foulkes Robartes : ' Who faulteth not , liveth not ; who mendeth faults is commended : The Printer hath faulted a little ; it may be the author oversighted more .

		Thy pain -LRB- Reader -RRB- is the least ; then err not thou most by misconstruing or sharp censuring ; lest thou be more uncharitable , than either of them hath been heedless : God amend and guide us all . '

		It is a pleasure to say that the kindly feeling which this foreword at once excites is in gen - eral not dispelled when one reads the entire work carefully and critically .

		A new history of the
United States	LOCATION	is in these days hardly a novelty ; for we have ' defini - tive , authoritative , and inclusive narrative ' his - tories , histories * from original documents by associated scholars , ' what we may call histories de luxe , -- and others , nearly all constructed and published on the soundest business prin - ciples .

		This work of Professor
Channing	PERSON	's , which is to be complete in eight volumes , has the distinction of being almost the only en - deavor , since
Bancroft	PERSON	's time , by a scholar of first rank , to tell , in one work and for the serious student , the whole story of American history .

		The first volume now appears in dig - nified form , without illustrations other than useful maps , -- altogether simplex mundiiiis .

		Into the opening chapter , which contains Just twenty-five pages , is c-ompressed all that Pro- fessor
Channing	PERSON	has to say of the Xorse dis - coveries , the state of
Europe	LOCATION	in the fifteenth century , and the voyages of
Columbus	LOCATION	; and the three chapters which follow comprise the nar - rative of Spanish , French and English explora - tion and settlement down to the age of the English Seamen .

		Xo separate treatment is given to the American Indians or to American Archaeology - ; and as a result of this judicious condensation and exclusion , the remaining four - fifths of the volume treat of the English colonies from the beginning to
1660	DATE	.

		This emphasis of English origins is maintained throughout the work , and appears in many ways .

		Professor Channing makes the reader see how the colonies form part of the expansion of
England	LOCATION	.

		English institutions which throw light on those in
America	LOCATION	are described in a manner that al - • A History of the

		ways holds our interest .

		In concluding this volume , he says : * Human nature was much the same in
Virginia	LOCATION	and
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, in
Maryland	LOCATION	and
Bhode Island	LOCATION	, that it was in contemporary
England	LOCATION	The colonists were still Englishmen in their feel - ings and prejudices , in their virtues and in their vices ... The year 1660 marks an epoch in the history of the English race , because the Restoration denoted the breaking down of the desire for reform in
England	LOCATION	and the intensifying of those forces which the Puritans had striven to overthrow .

		In colonial history it ended the first period in our annals .

		It saw a nation definitely planted in the New World -LRB- pp. 536-7 -RRB- .

		As such an eminently sane viewpoint would lead one to expect , the general tone of this volume evidences the author 's purpose to avoid bias as far as possible .

		He himself says that the time and place of one 's birth and breeding affect the judgment ; and he will understand , perhaps , that those bom outside of
New Eng	LOCATION	- land can not refrain from a genial amusement at the contrast between his matter-of-fact de - scription of the Separatist colonization of
Plymouth	LOCATION	, and the somewhat apologetic fervor which is put into a note at the end of the chap - ter .

		* It is to be hoped , ' he says , * that
Plymouth	LOCATION	Rock may long continue to form the theme of annual after-dinner discourses , and of more formidable set orations , ' -- although ` from the historian 's workshop ... the out - look is somewhat different .

		He sees that there never was a `` landing '' on
Plymouth	LOCATION	Rock or elsewhere , as described in oration or shown in painting or engraving -LRB- p. 320 -RRB- . '

		Well and good : but why refuse to apply the same rule to
Virginia	LOCATION	?

		and why out-Herod
Alexander Brown	PERSON	, -- who at least found a Captain
John Smith	PERSON	to vituperate , -- by omitting all refer - ence to
Smith	ORGANIZATION	's work in
Virginia	LOCATION	, except a statement of his arrest and a note as to the
Smith	ORGANIZATION	controversy ?

		Surely there may be a fairer compromise between the extremists on both sides , in an attitude toward
Smith	PERSON	like that of Osgood in his ' American Colonies . '

		It seems to us that Professor
Channing	PERSON	, in his lucid and interesting account of the policy of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	toward those who dissented from the views of the governing minority , has explained so much that he might have added one point more .

		In the clearest terms he rec - ognizes the illegality , from the English stand - point , of many of the acts of the
Massachusetts	LOCATION	authorities .

		He tells us , again , that the
Puri	PERSON	- tans had * not the remotest thought of founding in
Xew England	LOCATION	an asylum for the religiously persecuted of the earth .

		What they came here to do was to secure the freedom of their own consciences -LRB- p. 329 -RRB- . '

		Again , they ` were seven - teenth-century English men and women , pos - sessing the same prejudices and the same fail - 34 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, ings as their brothers and sisters whom they left behind in the old land ' -LRB- p. 357 -RRB- .

		Now , is it not clear that if animosity has been felt against the Puritans it is not because their actions were inconsistent with principles such as these which Professor Channing declares , but because they claimed to be something en - tirely different from their contemporaries ?

		* God sifted a whole nation , ' said
Stoughton	LOCATION	; and
New England	LOCATION	historians have said the same thing ever since .

		Their early writings , as
Doyle	PERSON	has well said , constitute not a histor -RCB- ' but a hagiology .

		Returning to the general criticism of the work , let us make it clear that Professor Chan - ning is entirely impartial in his attitude of critical questioning .

		As he rejects the testi - mony of Captain
John Smith	PERSON	, so he omits from his text all mention of DeGorgues ' revenge upon
Menendez	PERSON	and the Spaniards .

		Professor
Bourne	PERSON	, in his '
Spain	LOCATION	in
America	LOCATION	, ' p. 188 , gives the story and the critical difficulties which it involves ; but seems unwilling to reject it en - tirely .

		Without doubt , these omissions are de - termined partly by considerations of saving space : and this desire to compress may account for some exceptions to Professor Channing 's usual clearness .

		On p. 162 it is , for example , stated categorically that -- * The
Virginia	LOCATION	Charter provided a cumbrous form of government in which there was no one-man power , but everything was confided to councils .

		These were five in number .

		First and over all , there was to be in
England	LOCATION	a
Council	ORGANIZATION	for
Virginia	LOCATION	composed of leading men who might or might not have pecuniary interest in the affairs of the com - pany .

		Then , each '' colony , '' or '' company , '' should have its council in
England	LOCATION	and each planta - tion should have its council in
America	LOCATION	. '

		After reading the text of the Charter , and con - sulting the authorities at our disposal , we are unable to find in the charter provision for other than three councils , the great council in Eng - land and the local ones on the plantations .

		The author 's note gives no explanation of this some - what unique enumeration , but refers to the royal Instructions of the same year ; and here the citation from
Alexander Brown	PERSON	is loosely given .

		Again , we are puzzled to read on page 300 , with reference to the Charter of Sir
Ferdinando Gorges	PERSON	and his associates , obtained in
1620	DATE	, ' the governing body of this corporation was known as the Council for
New England	LOCATION	. '

		What is meant by ' governing body ' we do not know , but the charter states : ` We ... ordain ... that from henceforth , there shall be ... in our Towne of
Plymouth	LOCATION	, in the
County of Devon	LOCATION	, one Body politicque and cor - porate , which shall have perpetuall Succession , which shall consist of the Number of fourtie persons , and no more , which shall be , and shall be called and knowne by the Name the
Councill	ORGANIZATION	established at
Plymouth	LOCATION	in the
County of Devon	ORGANIZATION	for the planting , ruling , ordering and governing of New-England in
America	LOCATION	. '

		That is , the corporation was the council , and vice versa .

		Readers of recent historical literature will doubtless compare this volume of Professor
Channing	PERSON	's with two others which cover more or less the same period .

		Professor
Osgood	PERSON	's `
American Colonies	ORGANIZATION	in the Seventeenth Cen - tury ' is far more detailed on the institutional side , and upon some points gives what seems to the reviewer a better interpretation of the documents .

		On the other hand .

		President
Tyler	PERSON	's ' The English in
America	LOCATION	' is richer in detail of narrative , but is by comparison much less accurate in parts , -- in the treatment , for example , of the Dutch colonies .

		We might refer to other cases of unfortunate compression , such as the very scant discussion of
Maine	LOCATION	; but the space of this review is lim - ited , and we should be sorry for further criti - cism of an adverse character to overshadow our appreciation of the high merits of the volume .

		Professor
Channing	PERSON	's skilful interweaving of English and Colonial history , his excellent sum - ming up of periods of time , the attention which he pays the questions of education , health , and social order , his judicial attitude in contro - verted questions such as that of the founding of
Maryland	LOCATION	, the informing bibliographical matter appended to each chapter , and the large concept of development in the Colonial period as a whole , -- these are but a few points of excellence in the work .

		If in the volumes which follow the author shall be able to keep his bal - ance as well as in general he does in this vol - ume , we have no hesitation in predicting for the work in its entirety the very high regard of historical students .

		J THE DIAL , 85 lowers in the extent of his work and breadth of his iehthyological interests is
David Starr Jordan	PERSON	, President of
Leland Stanford Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity .

		Dr.
Jordan	PERSON	's published contributions to this science already .

		well-nigh reach the five hundred mark .

		The files of the serials issued by the
United States National Museum	ORGANIZATION	, by the
Bureau of Fisheries	ORGANIZATION	, and of numerous scientific and popular journals , attest his continuous activity for many years , and bear witness to his leadership in an ever-widening coterie of col - leagues and pupils who have shared with him the arduous task of iehthyological exploration in this continent and its adjacent seas .

		It was inevitable , as well as most fitting , that the * Guide to the Study of Fishes , ' the most com - prehensive treatise on American ichthyology , should come from his pen .

		WTiat his ' Fishes of Xorth and
Middle America	LOCATION	, ' written in cooperation with Dr.
Evermann	PERSON	, is to the sys - tematist in ichthyology , and the * Food and Game Fishes ' by the same authors is to the sportsman and the commercial fisherman , this new work will be to the naturalist and general reader who wishes an authoritative and com - prehensive discussion of this great section of the animal world , and an impartial review of the salient biological facts and theories of iehthyological science .

		Although the work is limited in its subject - matter to the finny tribes , it should not be inferred that it is restricted in interest to purely iehthyological problems .

		Xo naturalist is more alert than Dr.
Jordan	PERSON	in recognizing the broader import of the biological phenomena of his specialty .

		Consequently we find iehthyo - logical data repeatedly brought to bear upon the broader problems of evolution , taxonomy , morphology , orcology , and even Sociology .

		Dr.
Jordan	PERSON	's book is encyclopaedic in its scope . '

		This work treats of the fish from all the varied points of view of the different branches of the study of Ichthyology .

		In gen - eral , all traits of the fish are discussed , those which the fish shares with other animals most briefly , those which relate to the evolution of the group and the divergence of its various classes and orders most fully .

		The extinct forms are restored to their place in the series and discussed along with those still extant . '

		The headings of the chapters are indicative of the wide range of topics included .

		The open - ing one deals with the life of the fish , based on the familiar example of the long-eared sunfish , denizen of many a fishing-hole .

		Succeeding chapters treat of its exterior , dissection , skele - ton and the various systems of organs , its embryology and growth , ihstincts , habits , adaptations , colors , geographical distribution , barriers , dispersion , diseases , evolution , classi - fication and collection .

		Fishes as food for man is the heading of a discriminating discussion of the relative merits of various claimants for first place among food fishes , and the palm is awarded to the little eula ^ hon , or candlefish of our northwestern coast .

		In speaking of the methods of taking food-fishes , the author says : ' When fish are caught for pleasure or for the joy of being in the woods , recreation rises to the dignity of angling .

		The man who fishes , not for the good company of the woods and brooks , but to get as many fish as possible to eat or sell , is not an angler but a pot-fisher .

		The man who kills all the trout he can , to boast of his skill or fortune , is technically known as a trout-hog .

		Ethically , it is better to Ue about your great catches of fine fish than to make them .

		For most anglers , also , it is more easy .

		* The facts of ichthyology are everj-where used to illustrate and illumine the method and the path of organic evolution .

		The closing para - graph of Dr.
Jordan	PERSON	's interesting discussion of the distribution of fresh-water fishes is charac - teristic of this tendency , as well as illustrative of his terse , direct , and trenchant style .

		* The ultimate result of centuries on centuries of the restlessness of individuals is seen in the facts of geographical distribution .

		Only in the most general way can the history of any species be traced ; but could we know it all , it would be as long and eventful a story as the history of the colonization and settlement of
North America	LOCATION	by immigrants from
Europe	LOCATION	.

		But by the fishes each river in
America	LOCATION	has been a hundred times discov - ered , its colonization a hundred times attempted .

		In these efforts there is no cooperation .

		Every individual is for himself , every struggle a struggle of life and death ; for each fish is a cannibal , and to each species each member of every other species is an alien and a savage . '

		Xot content with the fishes that he has known .

		Dr.
Jordan	PERSON	falls into the ways of some would-be naturalists and in a chapter on the mythology of fishes tells his readers of the mer - maid supplied by the curio trade of the Orient , of
Rondelet	ORGANIZATION	's monk-fish , and even of the sea - serpent , of which ' many may be seen , but none will ever be caught .

		The great swimming reptiles of the sea vanished at the end of Mesozoic time , and as living creatures will never be known of man . '

		One of the most valuable chapters in the book is that which traces the growth of the science of ichthyology and passes critical judg - ment on the work of ichthyologists from Aris - totle and
Bloch	PERSON	to
Wright	PERSON	and
Zittel	PERSON	.

		Portraits of the men whose contributions have enriched the science adorn the pages of this chapter .

		On page 424 , Professor Bashford Dean makes the following estimate of
Agassiz	ORGANIZATION	's work on fossil fishes : ' Upon the purely scientific side , however , one must confess that the '' Poissons Fossiles '' is of minor importance , for the reason that as time has gone by it has been found to yield no generaliza -
86	DATE	THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	'' , tions of fundamental value .

		The classification of fishes advocated by
Agassiz	ORGANIZATION	, based upon the nature of the scales , has been shown to be convenient rather than morphological .

		This , indeed ,
Agassiz	ORGANIZATION	appears to realize in a letter written to Humboldt ; but on the other hand he regards his creation of the now discarded order of
Ganoids	LOCATION	, which was based upon integumental characters , as his most important contribution to the general study of ichthyology .

		And though there passed through his hands a series of forms more complete than has perhaps been seen by any later ichthyologist , a series which demon - strates the steps in the evolution of the various families and even orders of fishes , he is nowhere l6d to such important philosophical conclusions as was , for example , his contemporary ,
Johannes MuUer	PERSON	.

		And even to his last day , in spite of the light which palaeontology must have given him , he denied strenuously the truth of the doctrine of evolution , a result the more remarkable since he has even given in graphic form the geological occurrence of the various groups of fishes in a way which suggests closely a modern phylogenetie table , and since at various times he has emphasized the dictum that the history of the individual is but the epitomized history of the race . '

		We are perhaps still too near the battle - ground of Darwinism to hold the perspective necessary for an impartial estimate of the com - batants , especially of the antagonists of the successful doctrine .

		Natural selection still looms large in the landscape , overshadowing all interpretations of biological phenomena .

		But a cloud the size of a man 's hand has arisen on the horizon .

		The rediscovery of
Mendel	ORGANIZATION	's laws of hybridization , and the epoch-making Theory of Mutations of De Vries , bid faii ^ it seems , to challenge the weight of authority which has so long directed biological progress in one direc - tion , and perhaps even threaten to dethrone Darwinism from its preeminence and to rele - gate it to a subordinate place .

		The discussion of the ' Theory of Mutations ' may compel a reexamination and revaluation of the zoological evidence upon which Agassiz based his rejec - tion of the crude evolutionary hypotheses of
Lamarck	ORGANIZATION	, current at the time of his earlier work on fossil fishes , and his persistent refusal in his later years to accept as overwhelming the proofs offered in behalf of natural selection .

		It may be noted , in passing , that Dr.
Jordan	PERSON	retains in this present work the order of Ganoids .

		The latter part of the first and the whole of the second volume is given up to a systematic treatment of the orders and families of fishes .

		Special attention is given to those which mark the probable line of descent of vertebrates through the phyllum of fishes .

		Indeed , Dr.
Jordan	PERSON	goes back to the remotest ancestors to which the finny tribe can lay a valid claim , and devotes several chapters to the acorn-tongue worms and sea-squirts , the living and probably degenerate representatives of the primitive pos - sessors of a backbone and gill-slits .

		To this long catalogue of fishes Dr.
Jordan	PERSON	brings the great and inexhaustible store of his information gathered in decades of research and an intimate knowledge both of the fishes and whatever has been written about them .

		No pertinent saying , no bright bit of description or cogent presentation of disputed ground , has escaped his scissors .

		But the best of the work is the author 's own simple , direct , homely but well-balanced and comprehensive story of the fishes , making a book which is indeed , what the author hoped to make it , ' valuable to technical students , interesting to anglers and nature - lovers , and instructive to all who open its pages . '

		The nine hundred illustrations , many of them original , add greatly to the interest of the reader , though some that are duplicated and others not pertinent to the contiguous pages might be omitted without serious loss .

		Indeed , the necessary cost of two such bulky volumes will greatly limit the usefulness of this valuable work .

		It is to be hoped that an abridged edition in a single volume will be prepared at a price which will permit its wider circulation and insure its admission to the libraries of many villages and high-schools , and perhaps even of some college professors who will other - wise be deprived of its information .

		It is also to be regretted , for bibliographical reasons , that Dr.
Jordan	PERSON	has chosen a title already used in an eminent English treatise .

		or his brother the

		He was not great in any respect except perhaps in his ambitions ; but greatness is not always necessary to importance .

		And his activities touch more movements , more peoples , more vital interests , than those of any other statesman of that age .

		He was the richest and most powerful vassal in
England	LOCATION	.

		The leader of English armies , the chief of English diplo - mats , he was the son of a king , the father of a king , the father-in-law of two kings , and claimant to the crowns of
Castile	LOCATION	and Leon ; he was personally known to all the rulers of West - ern
Europe	LOCATION	, and , what is also important , he was the friend of Chaucer and the protector of Wycliffe .

		It seems clear that he ought to be better known to us than he is .

		It is therefore a laudable task that the author has undertaken ; it is also a large task , one that requires much industry and learning .

		The author 's sources number more than a hundred titles , and are gathered from all the nations of the western border of
Europe	LOCATION	from
Scotland	LOCATION	to
Portugal	LOCATION	.

		The results presented make a volume of about five hundred pages , a scholarly but also a highly interesting work .

Smith	ORGANIZATION	presupposes too much learning on the part of his readers : very frequently he inserts quotations from other languages , par - ticularly from the French , into his text .

		These should have been translated , as fourteenth - century French is not exactly like the Parisian idiom that we learn in schools to-day .

		We may be able to guess the meaning at times ; still , the interpretation too often remains in doubt .

		After the usual introductory chapters on the family , childhood , inheritance , and military training of Prince
John	PERSON	, the author proceeds to discuss Spanish ' affairs .

		This leads up to the invasion of
Spain	LOCATION	by the Black Prince for the purpose of replacing the fugitive king , Pedro the Cruel , on his Castilian throne .

		Don
Pedro	PERSON	was soon after assassinated by his rival Enrique , and his royal rights passed to his daughter
Constance	PERSON	, who was then with the English at
Bordeaux	LOCATION	.

		Two years later , in
1371	DATE	, she married
John of Gaunt	PERSON	, the Duke of Lan - caster .

		The importance of this marriage and of the ambitious policies that grew out of it has received its first adequate treatment in this book .

		It has been thought that this marriage brought about the French-Spanish alliance of that time , but the author shows that it was already in existence three years before .

		How - ever , it did lead to an understanding between
England	LOCATION	and
Portugal	LOCATION	, and to an invasion of
France	LOCATION	in
1373	DATE	which the author believes was to be merely a prelude to another invasion of
Spain	LOCATION	.

		After the failure of this expedition ,
John	PERSON	of Gaunt favored peace with the French , -- not , as some have supposed , because he saw the folly of continuing the war , but because he wished to isolate
Castile	LOCATION	.

		In the years immediately following , no prog - ress was made toward the attainment of Span - ish kingship .

		This period is largely filled with difficulties at home .

		The author holds that before the meeting of the ` Good Parliament * in
1376	DATE	there is no trace of that * Lancastrian influence ' that the Commons are said to have rebelled against .

		John of Gaunt might have remained outside the quarrel that rose between the
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	and the royal administration ; he became a party to it out of loyalty to his father 's government .

		In his eyes , ' criticism of the administration was criticism of the crown , and the
King	PERSON	's son was the representative of the crown and the natural champion of the court party . '

		Another error that the author refutes is the assertion , so often made , that the Black Prince took the opposite course on that occasion and assumed the leadership of the Commons .

		During the same years ,
John	PERSON	of G ^ unt appears as the protector of Wycliffe ; but his interest in the reformer grew out of wholly selfish considerations .

		The
Duke	ORGANIZATION	was a devout son of the Church and a firm believer in all her doctrines .

		He was a liberal patron of abbeys and friaries .

		All the outward practices that religion enjoined , he performed with punctili - ous care .

		In the popular demand for reform in Church administration , he took no interest .

		But he hated ' political bishops , ' especially such as placed themselves in opposition to the crown .

		Wycliffe had some ' decided views about priests who neglected the cure of souls for the care of castles , ' and the Duke thought he could use him in his fight with the spiritual lords .

		Sum - moned by the
Duke	ORGANIZATION	,
Wychffe	PERSON	came to
London	LOCATION	to preach clerical reform .

		Later , when his enemies clamored for the heretic 's life ,
John	PERSON	of Gaimt protected him , not because he sympa - thized with the Lollard movement , but because as a man of honor he could not desert a man who had served him and sought his protection .

		Mr.
Armitage	PERSON	-
Smith	ORGANIZATION	is also able to throw some light on another peculiar episode from the same period , the second invasion of
Castile	LOCATION	.

		For sixteen years the
Duke of Lancaster	ORGANIZATION	had claimed the crowns of
Christian Spain	LOCATION	.

		His policies at home and abroad had been shaped by his ambition to realize this claim .

		In
1386	DATE	the favorable moment seemed to have come .

		The answer to the puzzling question , how King 88 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, and
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	could be induced to assist in such a hopeless undertaking , the author finds in the confused state of European politics .

		Furthermore , the situation in
England	LOCATION	was fast becoming unendurable ; the
Duke	ORGANIZATION	's enemies would gladly do almost anything to get him out of the country .

		Though the expedition was a failure , the Duke found his claim to be of considerable value after all : it secured the throne of
Portugal	LOCATION	for one of his daughters , the throne of
Castile	LOCATION	for the other , and a hand - some annuity for himself .

		The author devotes about fifty pages to illus - trative documents , such as
Lancaster	ORGANIZATION	's will and epitaph , his retinue , arms , seals , and the like .

		The book is carefully indexed and is provided with several useful maps .

		It also contains a few pictures , for the most part reproductions from fifteenth-century manuscripts .

		These have a value and interest of their own ; but in the present work they serve mainly to empha - size the author 's statement that ' the attempt to illustrate fourteenth-century history from con - temporary sources is almost hopeless . '

		The
Necessity of Empire	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Ten years ago , the literature of modern inter - national politics was so limited in amount that one could make himself pretty well acquainted with it as a mere diversion ; to-day it is so for - midable that bibliographers are appalled by it and readers fairly swamped .

		The decade has been thus prolific because it has been filled with a succession of events and movements which have given every possible stimulus to people 's interests in the affairs of the world at large .

		The Spanish-American war , the Boer war , the
Boxer	PERSON	uprising , and the Russo-Japanese war , -- not to mention a host of minor movements , -- have all operated immensely to broaden the range of information and opinion of the aver - age European or American , or even Asiatic .

		The magazines have done their utmost to sat - isfy , and at the same time further to stimulate , our craving for knowledge of the nations across seas ; and from travellers , newspaper corre - spondents , missionaries and statesmen has come a veritable deluge of books in which to study the manners , beliefs , institutions , domestic con - ditions and international relations of every people on the globe .

		In the midst of a vast amount of purely ephemeral literature of this sort , it is a pleas - ure to encounter a work which depends for its reception , not upon the momentary interests of * The Friends of
England	LOCATION	.

		By the Hon.
George Peel	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		the casual reader , but rather on the abiding zeal of the scholarly ; and this , we think , may fairly be said of the volume before us for review .

		About three years ago the * Honorable
George Peel	PERSON	published a book under the title of ' The Enemies of
England	LOCATION	, ' in which he sought to account for and to describe the international bearings of the generally admitted hostility of European powers toward the English .

		The grounds for this hostility he found , not in race or religion or manners or trade or envy , but rather in the persistency with which , as he claimed ,
England	LOCATION	for the past eight hundred years has played the thankless role of ' cham - pion of the liberties of
Europe	LOCATION	. '

		His idea was that from the time of
Pope Innocent III	ORGANIZATION	.

		on , a series of powers , -- chiefly the
Papacy	LOCATION	,
Spain	LOCATION	,
Holland	LOCATION	, and
France	LOCATION	, -- had aspired to secure dominion over the continent ; but that , since the success of any one of them would involve the ruin of
England	LOCATION	, she had resisted and in the end defeated the favorite project of each in turn , thereby bringing down upon herself the hatred of them all .

		England was thus rep - resented as being in modern times the sole guardian of the liberties of European states and peoples against the cherished aspirations of various powers to universal dominion , even though her course was dictated admittedly by motives of self-preservation .

		Mr.
Peel	PERSON	's new volume , ' The Friends of
England	LOCATION	, ' is designed to supplement the earlier one by describing in a similar way the policy of the English in the world outside
Europe	LOCATION	.

		It is , in short , an attempt to explain the origin and development of the Empire as distinguished from the insular state .

		What we find in it is in no sense a history of the Empire but simply an elucidation of what the author conceives to have been the great guiding force in the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	's creation .

		Mr ,
Peel	PERSON	's theory on this important matter is interesting , and inasmuch as the burden of his book is to substantiate this theory we may be allowed to sttte it in his own words .

		In one of his characteristic summaries , he says : ' The Empire is the fruit of a long , deliberate , persistent , and conscious effort upon the part of our statesmen to avert the predominance of any European power .

		If this be so , then the policy of
England	LOCATION	, whether in the old world of
Europe	LOCATION	or in the continents without , stands explained as one coherent and consistent plan .

		Her maintenance of the balance of power in
Europe	LOCATION	and her construc - tion Oi an empire in the outer continents have been two aspects of the same design ... The first proposition -LSB- maintained in this book -RSB- is that European pressure from without is the cause of the formation of the empire ; the second is that European pressure from without is the main cause of its maintenance .

		When that pressure increases , the empire tends to be consolidated ; when it dimin - ishes , the empire tends to dissolve .

		Let it be added ,
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 89 however , that though this sense of common danger forms the empire 's base , in our own day a true and mutual affection has flowered from this stern and stubborn root . '

		The thesis to be maintained is thus clearly laid down : it was the aggressions of European powers that forced
England	LOCATION	in the sixteenth century to enter upon the work of empire-build - ing and it is the rivalries and hostilities of these powers that has kept her at it ever since ; imperial aggrandizement has been her only means of preserving her high rank among the nations .

		It need hardly be remarked that this view contrasts sharply with others which have been propounded by students of world politics .

		Sir
John Seeley	PERSON	's idea , set forth in his lectures on the Expansion of
England	LOCATION	, has in recent vears been the generally ac-cepted one , namely , that the Empire has come to be what it is more or less by chance , without much deliberate plan - ning or definite policy .

		` We have conquered and peopled half the world , ' declared the Cam - bridge professor , ' in a fit of absence of mind . '

		A second empire grew up after the loss of the American colonies ' almost in our despite , ' and ' our acquisition of
India	LOCATION	was made blindly . '

		; Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	, speaking in
Liverpool	LOCATION	in
January	DATE	of the present year , declared : ' We have never had a colonial policy ; but , somehow or other , we have been allowed to blunder into the best parts of the world . '

		On the other hand , the general body of opinion on the continent of
Europe	LOCATION	is that , far from being the result of chance , the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	is the fruit of the most deliberate and calculating policy , -- of a reso - lute and unscrupulous determination to annex any part of the globe which can be laid hold of in order to swell British commerce and enhance British power and prestige .

		Mr.
Peel	PERSON	under - takes to demonstrate that neither the ' accident ' theory of
Seeley	PERSON	and
Chamberlain	PERSON	nor the ' insatiate avarice ' theory of the continental publicists affords the true explanation of the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	's existence .

		To do this , and to sub - stantiate his own opinion that the Empire has been created deliberately as a means of defense against continental rivals , he consumes half a dozen chapters with a running sketch of the development of
Greater Britain	LOCATION	from its
Eliza	LOCATION	- bethan beginnings to our own day .

		He shows how it was only under the pressure of Spanish ascendancy in the late sixteenth centurj - -LRB- with the pressure of the French in
Canada	LOCATION	, the Por - tuguese in
Africa	LOCATION	, and the Dutch in the
Spice Islands	LOCATION	operating to the same end -RRB- that the English people began to realize the imperative necessity of empire .

		Having avoided terri - torial expansion as long as possible , they set to work at it only when they needs must .

		In Elizabethan times the efforts made were spas - modic , with the result of failure in every quar - ter ; but in the seventeenth century * the matter was taken definitely in hand , and as a conse - quence an empire was at length established on the shores and among the outlying islands of the continent of
Xorth America	LOCATION	, in defiance of the arms and authority of
Spain	LOCATION	.

		Simul - taneously our men of business gained for them - selves , with the consent and approval of our government , a foothold for trade in Hindostan .

		Here , too ,
Spain	LOCATION	, or more accurately
Portugal	LOCATION	, then incorporated with
Spain	LOCATION	, opposed us , and
Holland	LOCATION	, the offshoot of the Spanish empire , acted similarly . '

		And when , finally , commer - cial exploitation gave place to political domina - tion in
India	LOCATION	, it was not accident , and not for greed of power , that the change of base was made .

		, ' The genuine cause of the establishment of our sovereignty in
India	LOCATION	was that , during
the first half of the eighteenth century	DATE	and later ,
France	LOCATION	appeared in overwhelming strength and the French colonies seriously threatened the English domin - ions in Hindostan .

		They resolutely attacked us ; we defended ourselves for very life ; as the conse - quence of that successful resistance
India	LOCATION	fell into our hands ; the company could not hold it or organ - ize it unaided ; the government undertook the obli - gation .

		Here was neither blindness nor rapacity .

		The Indian empire was a legitimate organization raised by us deliberately against the forward march of our European foe ' .

		In thi ^ manner the whole growth of the Em - pire is explained .

		Everywhere it has been ' not for loot , but for life , ' that the English have struggled so persistently for dominion .

		If the period from about
1815	DATE	to
1870	DATE	was one of little expansive activity , -- indeed , even a time of weakening faith in the usefulness of a colo - nial empire , -- it was only because this was an era during which
Europe	LOCATION	was recovering from the Xapoleonic upheaval , and comparatively little was being done by any of the powers in the way of aggrandizement at English ex - pense .

		The last thirty-five years Mr.
Peel	PERSON	re - gards as an epoch of renewed pressure . '

		Con - scription has filled the barrack-yards of the continent ; new navies dispute with us the roadway of the high seas ; and , stirred by such transformations , anxiety has touched every nerve of the British race . '

		Hence the reorgan - ization and extension of the Empire in this period .

		The two most conspicuous factors in this renewed pressure Mr.
Peel	PERSON	thinks to be the increase in the military power of
Russia	LOCATION	and the progress made by
Germany	LOCATION	with her fleet ; for '
Germany	LOCATION	and
Eussia	LOCATION	are now the claim - ants for the leadership of
Europe	LOCATION	, and there - fore most likely to come into contact with Eng - land , the immemorial guardian of the balance of power . '

		It can not be denied that to the student of 90 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, world-politics Mr.
Peel	PERSON	's views , as well as his methods of demonstrating them , are richly sug - gestive ; and 3 ^ et it is impossible to repress the feeling that the theory underlying them is being pushed a good deal too far .

		The author at the outset unfortunately assumes the atti - tude of an advocate pleading a case , and this at once compromises his work on the score of judiciousness . '

		The Empire has been the fruit , neither of chance nor of rapine , but of a vital and overwhelming necessity . '

		This is the thesis , and the whole range of British imperial history is laid under contribution to prove it .

		The task is achieved with a considerable de - gree of success , because up to a certain point the thesis is easily capable of defense .

		The difficulty is that Mr.
Peel	PERSON	tries to carry his views too far , and is unfortunately prone to minimize , if not wholly to neglect , everything which stands in his way .

		There is enough truth and enough originality in his interpreta - tion of the Empire to have made his book an extraordinary one , if only he had not allowed this enthusiasm to get the better of his judg - ment .

		Axioms have little or no place in his - tory , and Mr.
Peel	PERSON	has tried to reduce the whole of British imperial history to an axiom .

		The building of a great empire under modem conditions is a most complicated process , and it will not do to attempt to make all of its aspects and phases square with any one motive or method .

		Mr ,
Seeley	PERSON	erred somewhat in this direction ; the continental publicists err more ; and , if the truth be told , Mr.
Peel	PERSON	goes furthest wrong of all .

		Yet ' The Friends of
England	LOCATION	' is a valuable book .

		It brings out a phase of imperial poli - tics too much neglected by past writers .

		If one will only be on his guard against its in - discriminate generalizations , he can find in it a genuine stimulus to productive thought .

		In some ways the most striking portion of the work is the last two chapters , in which the in - terference of western peoples in the affairs of the Orient is reprobated in the language of the Chinese Ah
Hok	ORGANIZATION	and defended from the view - point of
Christendom	LOCATION	.

		of the Eussell-Gladstone ministry upon the question of an extension of the suffrage and
Disraeli	PERSON	's famous ' education ' of his party upon this subject , the disestablishment of the
Irish Church	ORGANIZATION	, the settlement of the
Alabama	LOCATION	claims , and the successful campaign for and establish - ment of an adequate system of public education .

		These are the topics customarily regarded as of principal importance in the period covered ; but in addition much space is here given to special questions and incidents that from time to time agitated the Church of
England	LOCATION	, and occasionally excited as much noise in
Parlia	LOCATION	- ment itself as in purely clerical circles .

		In fact , the reader almost finds himself at times haled back to the period of the Eeformation , or to the complicated religious differences that stirred
Stuart	PERSON	and
Puritan England	LOCATION	, yet with the distinction that in modern times in Eng - land Church questions do not determine the lines upon which political parties are formed .

		At first sight , the author 's interest in these controversies , and the emphasis placed upon them throughout his work , appear to indicate a lack of true historical perspective ; but it may well be that his purpose is to bring out , by detailing a series of Church controversies in themselves comparatively unimportant , the es - sential interest of Englishmen in the forms and ceremonies of their established Church .

		It is an attribute of the English character little understood and scarcely recognized by foreign writers , and Mr.
Paul	PERSON	has at least made clear that the Church is in itself a living political question in parliamentary life .

		No historian can hope at this early date to characterize finally so recent an historical epoch as that of which Mr.
Paul	PERSON	is writing .

		It is , in fact , impossible to judge as yet as to what events of the nineteenth century have been his - torically important in determining
England	LOCATION	's destiny or in moulding her character .

		It fol - lows , therefore , that all that is possible to offer is an accurate and readable summary of those events that have been regarded as important by contemporaries .

		Thus Mr.
Paul	PERSON	's work reads at times as if it were an abstract or a compila - tion from some periodical publication like the ^ Annual Eegister . '

		Yet it is more than this , for in the midst of his narrative the author interjects sentences , or parts of sentences , that light up the mere summary of event with flashes of individual analysis , serving to give the author 's opinion of incidents and of men .

		These constitute the really valuable portion of the work ; for Mr.
Paul	PERSON	is a shrewd observer , has ideas of his own , and does not hesitate to express them .

		Whether one agrees with him or not , it is worth while to know what those opinions are .

		THE DIAL .

		91 Another interesting feature of the work is the admiration expressed for and credit given to the men who did not stand at the head of political parties , though interested in politics , but who by genius and hard work had influ - ence upon important aspects of English life .

		Historians are somewhat prone to eliminate from their works the lesser men of politics , though these may have rendered distinguished services to the country .

		But Mr.
Paul	PERSON	, who has been a
Member of Parliament	ORGANIZATION	and also a journalist , imderstands better than do the pro- fessional historians the minor influences that are constantly brought to bear upon the great leaders of parties , and gives full credit to such men as Mill in educational reform .

		Lord Acton in religious controversies , or
Joseph Arch	PERSON	in forwarding the interests of the agricultural laborers .

		Gladstone and Disraeli naturally require much attention ; but here also the author is not content with an examination of their political services merely , but expresses his own opinion of their abilities in other fields of action and of thought .

		England is just begin - ning to realize the essential genius of Disraeli , and the recent celebration of the centenary of his birth has aroused a wide-spread revival of interest in his strange character .

		Probably Mr.
Paul	PERSON	is to some extent unconsciously voicing this newly arisen belief in
Disraeli	LOCATION	's greatness , when , unlike most previous writers , he neglects to damn , and sometimes even consents to praise , the illustrious Jew .

		In a brief notice of the first and second volumes of this work -LRB- The Dial ,
April 16 , 1904	DATE	-RRB- it was said , apropos of the author 's lau - dation of Peel and Free-trade , and referring to the
Chamberlain	PERSON	policy of quasi-protection now being urged in
England	LOCATION	: ' It will be interesting to note whether Mr.
Paul	PERSON	will attempt in the remaining volumes of his work to point a moral applicable to the present interesting political situation in
England	LOCATION	, -- whether , in fact , his history is a genuine historical undertaking or a bit of political propaganda . '

		The present vol - ume clearly indicates that no such propaganda is intended .

		Mr ,
Paul	PERSON	is offering , very success - fully , a convenient and readable summary of the political events of the last fifty years ; while here , much more than in the earlier volumes , he offers valuable characterizations of activities and of men not wholly concerned with the purely political field .

'

		It is indeed pleasant to read the essayist 's graceful and often witty discourse on subjects endeared by familiarity ; but how many , we wonder , on both sides of the

A. S. Barnes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Covering only the seven - teenth century of American history , it is evidently intended to be one of a series dealing with colonial life , especially in its social aspects .

		It is addressed to readers who are too mature for the brief text - books on colonial history and can not afford the expenditure of time and money necessary to read the larger histories .

'

		A careful reading leaves one with the impression that the novelties here set forth are to be found in a few concluding chapters , and that the larger part of the little volume is given to a re-telling of the familiar facts of colonial history , although in most charm - ing language .

		The planting of the different colonies is described in chronological order , the Indian wars are treated in detail , and the struggles for the colonial charters set forth .

		Upon certain points the author has decided opinions .

		` The little colony of
Rhode Island	LOCATION	was the only region on this great continent where any such thing as real and unrestrained religious liberty and the absolute equality of men before the law , as we now understand these things , were fully recognized . '

		In another chapter we are told that `
Virginia	LOCATION	did indeed decree the banishment of dissenters from the established religion , but the decree was never very rigorously enforced .

		In none of the other colonies did religion so dom - inate the minds of men or so control their social relations as it did in the Puritan commonwealths . '

		The future indexer may well test his fitness for his chosen calling by a perusal of this book .

		He may learn that unless he can say ` blessed be drudgery ' he has missed his voca - tion ; that the price paid for the attainment of perfection in this work is the virtue of a never - ceasing patience and an eternal vigilance .

		But in addition he may find as reward various de - lightful excursions into countless worlds of thought and numberless vistas of enchantment .

		Greek Art Painting and sculpture , like poetry grammatically and prose , are the expression of treated .

		thought in a language whose gram - mar must be studied in order to understand their meaning .

		To understand a work of art , we must consider not merely what it represents in fact , but also the conventions of the artist as deter - mined by the period in which he lived , his school , and the range of his ideas .

1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL fessor
Percy Gardner	PERSON	, Litt.D. , of
Oxford	LOCATION	, calls his handbook of the study of Greek art , ' A Gram - mar of Greek Art ' -LRB- Maemillau -RRB- .

		To the acci - dence of the Greek lau .

		# ruage he compares the simple laws iu art , of relation to material , of relation to space , of balance and of proportion , mieonseiously observed by the Greek artists .

		To syntax he compares the relation of scene to scene , of picture to myth and to literature , of sculpture and coin to history .

		The analogy between Greek art and Greek literature he traces still further .

		The Greeks borrowed from the Phoenicians and others the letters of the alphabet and used them to convey their own ideas in their own language and according to the rules of their own grammar .

		So they began their artistic activity by bon-ow - ing from the nations around them , or perhaps from the primitive dwellers in their own land , certain simple fonns , and using them to embody their own notions of decoration , their own reli - gious beliefs , and the tales of their ancestral heroes .

		By elucidating these principles of inter - pretation -LRB- which by the way , are not original with him -RRB- in sixteen chapters on the architectm-e , the sculpture , the painting and the coins of the Greeks , the learned author contributes to the series of ` Handbooks of Arohaeology and
Antiq	PERSON	- uities ' a valuable volimie whose only fault is that it fails as an attempt to provide an elemen - tary study of the subject , and presupposes consid - erable classical training on the part of the reader .

		^ , In ` The Psvchology of Beaut v ' Tse ^ uZ -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , ` Miss
Ethel D. Puff	PERSON	`` er attempts to fonnulate an aesthetic system that shall command universal acceptance and bring peace at last to the warring camps of impressionists ' and dogmatists , symbolists and formalists , moralists and exponents of the * Art for Art 's Sake ' propaganda .

		Philosophy ,
Miss Puffer	ORGANIZATION	tells us , has always made the mistake of holding its theories of beauty too far aloof from the actual , the concrete instance ; whereas so - called aesthetic criticism , of which recent years have been so prolific , is generally written quite without regard to any central principle , and the same sad lack of system prevails among investi - gators of that other modern science -- the physi - ological psychology of aesthetic emotions .

		`
The Psychology of Beauty	ORGANIZATION	' seeks to remedy this state of things .

		It propounds an original aesthetic formula based upon the currently accepted theorj - of emotion , and explains this formula and makes it intelligible and useful by tracing its applica - tion to three of the fine arts -- music , painting , and literature .

		Miss
Puffer	PERSON	's metho < l of treat - ment is precise and logical without being over - technical , and her development of her theme in con-elated essays , each fairly independent of the others , lessens the strain upon the attention of the general reader .

		This is not the place to dis - cuss the validity of Miss
Puffer	PERSON	's conclusions , still less to enter upon the familiar contention of the possibility of an authoritative canon of taste such as she proposes to establish .

		We can only commend
Miss Puffer	PERSON	's lai-ge grasp of her subject and consequent fitness for the Avork she has taken in hand , -- a work which , because of its novel direction and its thoroughly modern methods , demand attention from students of aesthetics .

		Spanish jj ^ .

		^
Martin Hume	PERSON	, in his recent work on English ^ ^ ` Spanish Influence on English literature .

		Litei'ature ' -LRB-
Lippineott	ORGANIZATION	's -RRB- , has pub - lished a series of popular lectures without adding materially to what is already known on his sub - ject .

		The two
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	dissertations , by Mr.
Underbill	PERSON	on ` Spanish Literature in the
England	LOCATION	of the Tudors ' and by Mr.
Chandler	PERSON	on ` Romances of Roguery , ' have treated limited por - tions of the subject with far greater fulness than Mr.
Hume	PERSON	has done , and fail to include very little that is essential in his treatment .

		The two great periods of Spanish influence were embraced by the reigns of the Tudors and the Stuarts .

		If Mr.
Hume	PERSON	had worked out the Stuart period as fully as Mr.
Underbill	PERSON	did the Tudor period , and had then given a comprehensive view of the Spanish influence in its entirety , he would have met a much-felt want .

		The book , moreover , seems to be pervaded by an exaggerated sense of the impor - tance of its thesis .

		Anything Spanish in English literature is unduly emphasized .

		Often it was only the names that were Spanish , as in
Kyd	PERSON	's plays ; yet Mr.
Hume	PERSON	assumes this as showing sti-ong Spanish influence .

		It sometimes meant only that interest in
Spain	LOCATION	was in the air .

		Tlie ` Spanish Tragedy ' is Spanish in nothing more than name .

		Since Mr.
Hume	PERSON	has limited himself to a strictly popular treatment of his subject , one can not but regret that he did not devote a chapter to a consideration of the real significance of the Spanish influence , what it contributed of perma - nent value , as in the case of the picaresque novel , as well as what was of more fleeting con - sequence .

		A broad philosophic and aesthetic view of the field would have had interest , and would not have been without value as criticism .

		New essavs
Bishop Spalding	PERSON	has long since by Bishop made his mark as a forceful and
Spalding	LOCATION	.

		suggestive thinker , whether his thoughts are formulated for oral expression or solely for the printed page .

		The essay from whiA his latest volume takes its name -- ` Reli - gion and Art ' -LRB-
A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- -- will doubtless provoke much dissent from the view - point of the artist , because of its insistence on the necessity of a distinct moral purpose in all great works of art ; but he has yet to learn the very alphabet of wise reading who does not know that the most profitable lessons are often to be gained from that with which it is impjossible wholly to agree .

		After this essay comes the address on ` Educational Ideals ' which Dr.
Spald	PERSON	- ing delivered before the
International Congress of Arts	ORGANIZATION	and Sciences at
St. Louis	LOCATION	during the Exposition .

		The keynote of this address lies in the introductory thesis , that so far as education is concerned , the material prc ^ rress of any age is merely incidental and subordinate to its intel - lectual , moral , and religious development .

		The volume contains , further , an essay on ` The Mean - insr of Education , ' the address delivered at the 94 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, memorial services in honor of Dr.
N. S. Davis	PERSON	, and an essay on ` Social Questions , ' in which the ground is maintained that the disorders arising between capital and labor are due to a general letting down in the moral tone of society , and are therefore to be relieved by the cultivation of nobler efforts and more spiritual aims .


Paris	LOCATION	and Mr.
Alvan F. Sanborn	PERSON	's `
Paris	LOCATION	and the Social the Social Revolution ' -LRB- Small , Revolution .


Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- contains a descrip - tive history of all the revolutionary types in French society , from the red anarchist and the revolutionary socialist to the moderate Bohemians of the
Latin Quarter	LOCATION	and the advocates of advanced theories in poetry , music , and art .

		It does not require a large stretch of imagination to see how Zola and Mirabeau may be associated with
Jean Grave	ORGANIZATION	and
Elisee Reclus	PERSON	as preachers and teachei-s of social revolution .

		But when
Cazin	LOCATION	,
Rodin	LOCATION	,
Charpentier	PERSON	, -- all the leaders in French literary and artistic activity , -- are included in the number , it makes the leaders look less red-handed .

		Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	's development of the revolutionary spirit in modern art , and his application of it to dozens of well-known cases , is no more interesting than his description of the declared anarchist and socialist types and tenets .

		The power of the chanson , the romantic figure of the wandering revolutionary or trimardeur , the bold support of party newspapers at the risk of life and freedom , the varied methods of propa - ganda , by example , by writing , orally , -- all are well portrayed .

		Moreover , the humor , the sym - pathy , and the proportion that characterize Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	's attitude give color to his assertion that he is not a revolutionist , though there are moments when he ` fancies he would like to be one , it appears such an eminently satisfying state . '

		The book gains an added vividness and charm from the illustrations by
Vaughan Trow	ORGANIZATION	- bridge .

		The work is particularly rich in references to periodical literature .

Richard G. Badger	PERSON	.

		It is the work of that ripe scholar , the Rev.
Theodore C. Williams	PERSON	, and de - serves a warm welcome from classical students and lovers of poetry alike . '

		Who Was He ? '

		by Mr.
Edward Latham	PERSON	, is a concise dictionary of general biography , published by
Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, who also send us a companion volume of * Mottoes and Badges , ' com - piled by Mr.
W. S. W. Anson	PERSON	.

		These are volumes in '
Routledge	PERSON	's Miniature Reference Library . '

		One of the most important books of the late
Edward Moran	PERSON	was the series of thirteen marine paintings descriptive of important events in
Ameri	LOCATION	- can history , now on exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum in
New York	LOCATION	.

		These paintings are now reproduced in a volume , with descriptive text and commentary by Mr.
Theodore Sutro	PERSON	, and published by the
Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The book is entitled ' Thirteen Chapters of
American History	ORGANIZATION	, ' and con - tains also portraits of
Edward Moran	PERSON	and his wife , besides a memoir of the artist .

		The subjects of the paintings range from the landing of
Leif Erik	PERSON	- son -LRB- unhappily misprinted '
Lief	PERSON	' -RRB- to the return of the battleships from the Spanish-American War .

		They constitute a collection of impressive beauty , aside from their function of illustrating some of the most striking phases of American history .

		We have to chronicle the appearance of six new volumes in the * Belles Lettres Series ' of
Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		To the Old English section of the series there are now added editions of '
Juliana	PERSON	, ' edited by Professor
William Strunk	PERSON	; *
Judith	PERSON	, ' edited by Professor
Albert S. Cook	PERSON	, and ' The Battle of Maiden , ' with short poems from the ' Chronicle , ' edited by Dr.
Walter John Sedgefield	PERSON	.

		The other three volumes here to be mentioned are
Robertson	PERSON	's ' Society ' and ' Caste , ' edited by Mr.
T. Edgar Pemberton	PERSON	,
Chapman	PERSON	's ' Bussy o '
Ambois	PERSON	' and its sequel , edited by Professor
Frederick S. Boas	PERSON	; and ' Selected Poems by
Algernon Charles Swinburne	PERSON	, ' edited by Dr.
William Morton Payne	PERSON	.

		While the volumes of this series are primarily intended for college use , we may suggest that the issues of the more modern works provide con - venient editions for the general reader and the private collector .

		The Swinburne volume , in par - ticular , will be welcome to many readers as pro- viding , in small compass and at a nominal price , a classified selection of the author 's greatest poems .

THOMAS HARDY	PERSON	'S Complete Works IN TWENTY VOLUMES THE best critics of
England	LOCATION	and

Thomas Hardy	PERSON	will occupy a permanent place in English Literature .

		There is a vigor and virility about his work , a rude strength , a portrayal of men whose blood runs quick and red , and of women whose primal passions make them kin to all healthy women of the world , an amazing command of expression , the power to tell a story with direct , straightforward , dramatic force , chargfing like a storm through the pages -- all of which place
Hardy	PERSON	among the greatest story-tellers .

		Is there a better story anywhere than
Tess	PERSON	of the D' Urbervilles f The author calls it '' the story of a pure woman , '' and in spite of her fall she is that .

		It is a novel splendidly heroic in execution , terrific in its stress , surcharged with passion , and of enduring and immortal interest .

		BRIEFER MENTION 120 NOTES 121 TOPICS IN LEADING PERIODICALS ... 122 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 122 CLANNISH CEITICISM .

		The poetry of Thoma.s
Moore	PERSON	has recently been brought into the foreground of critical disciLssion , partly by the appearance of Mr.
Stephen Gwynn	PERSON	's contribution to the ' English Men of Letters ' series , partly by the transla - tion of a youthful volume of Dr.
Georg Brandes	PERSON	dealing with the English poetic re - vival of the early nineteenth century .

		Both books give to
Moore	PERSON	a higher place than may fairly be claimed for him , the reasons being , re - spectively , that one is the work of an Irishman , and the other the work of a foreigner .

		We mean by this last statement that even as well - equipped a foreign critic as Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	can never penetrate far enough into the spirit of English poetry to appreciate its finer cadences and emotional values , but must ever remain exposed to the danger of mistaking tinkle for music , and tinsel for gold .

		The reviewers , naturally , have fallen afotil of these exaggerated estimates , and have pointed out their uncritical character .

		No less naturally , the reviewers have in turn been assailed by numbers of ex - cited Irishmen , and a very pretty controversy has resulted .

		Some score of years ago ,
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	got himself into the same sort of trouble as these reviewers , with the difference that , in - stead of Irishmen , he had to reckon with the complaints of Scotchmen .

		He had rashly at - tempted a strictly dispassionate analysis of the poetry of Bums , and had come to the temper - ate conclusion that this poetry had ` truth of matter and truth of manner , but not the ac - cent or the poetic virtue of the highest mas - ters . '

		But his aggrieved Scotch critics could never forgive him for saying that `
Burns	PERSON	's world of Scotch drink , Scotch religion , and Scotch manners is often a harsh , a sordid , a repulsive world , ' and that a Scotchman , being used to it , ' has a tenderness for it . '

		In this case , as in the more recent case of
Moore	PERSON	, the spirit of clannishness took the place of an im - partial effort to get at the truth , and prejudice was invoked to the confusion of judgment .

		It may well be that
Arnold	LOCATION	, in that famous essay on ' The Study of Poetry , ' was not alto - gether fair to
Burns	PERSON	, and it may be that our recent reviewers have not done complete justice to those qualities of
Moore	PERSON	that have so en - deared him to his compatriots , but it is ob - vious that the critic whose outlook is not nar - 104 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, rowed b -RCB- ' ^ such racial prepossessions as prevail with
Scotchmen	PERSON	when
Burns	PERSON	is in question , or with Irishmen when
Moore	PERSON	is in question , is likely to be the critic whose judgment will prove finally acceptable to intelligent readers .

		He at least is impersonal , and they as certainly are not .

		Tlie sort of eulogy that Irishmen heap upon
Moore	PERSON	, and
Scotchmen	PERSON	upon
Burns	PERSON	, upon the occasion of their festive gatherings , has its value for promoting good fellowship and bright - ening the glow of mutual sympathy , but does not commend itself to the cooler judgment of mankind at large , or even of the participants in these love-feasts when they come to think it ever with themselves .

		These are but two specific illustrations of the clannish habit which is so prejudicial to the interests of rational criticism .

		Whenever or wherever any group of men is held together by a common bond of sympathy , the tendency to
$ xalt	MONEY	their own efforts will be made manifest .

		The bond may be racial , or it may be the bond of a religious , social , or political organization , or it may be no stronger bond than results from contiguity and the community of mate - rial interests , but the outcome will be the same in all the cases .

		If the group is large enough to find literary expression , its members will instinctively unite in glorifying the product , and in reviling the captious dissenter . '

		Be - hold what we can do ' will be its vaunt , and any attempts to belittle its achievement will be set down to the score of envy on the part of the distanced rival .

		The results of this clannishness are sometimes pathetically amusing .


^ %	PERCENT	at could be more so , for example , than collections of the poets and poetry of this or that state or county , than anthologies of the gems of thought inspired by this or that religious persuasion .

		Let a Cath - olic , or a Methodist , or a Unitarian produce a book , and straightway all the voices and or - gans of his kind will sing its praises .

		Let some frontier town discover an author in its midst , and its spokesmen will promptly view them - selves as denizens of the coming literary cen - tre of the country .

		Tested by the even scale of criticism , these phenomena may be utterly in - significant , but the loaded scales of eectarian or provincial prejudice will show them to weigh heavily enough .

		The favorite preacher be - comes a
Chrysostom	PERSON	, the popular orator a Demosthenes , the budding novelist a Dickens or a
Scott	PERSON	, the boudoir poet a Tennyson or a Keats , and all homely barnyard fowl in general become swans and peacocks and birds of para - dise .

		All these provincialisms and exhibitions of the clan-spirit have little enough to do with real - criticism , but nevertheless they work no small amount of mischief .

		There is no praivse so foolish that it will not be taken at its face value by readers already predisposed in favor of the work which is praised , and no writer too poor to be puffed up by such ill-judged adulation .

		Thus the feeble amateur is persuaded to think himself a genius , and the innocent public is practiced upon to the confusion of its sense of proportion .

		The effect is pernicious in both ways ; it may turn a good farmer or carpenter into a bad poet or novelist , and it is sure to waste the time of many misguided readers upon productions unworthy of their attention .

		These literary idols of the market-place are responsi - ble for much perversion of the true faith .

		After all , these critical judgments of the clan - nish kind merely illustrate in an intensified form the subjective theory of criticism .

		If there are no such things as standards , if the individual recognizes no test of excellence save his own likes and dislikes , then these narrow or provincial opinions are amply justified .

		One may say of a piece of literary composition , ' It gives me pleasure , therefore it must be deserv - ing of praise , ' and it will be hard to convince him that the conclusion stands in the relation of non seqidtur to the premise .

		If such a per - son may say further , ' It gives me pleasure , and also pleases all the others of my sort , ' the argument is clinched , and there is no gainsay - ing the strength of the position .

		Yet the de - cision of real criticism , which may reject the work in the face of however clamorous a mob , rests , and must inevitably rest , upon a very dif - ferent basis .

		It must rest upon the concensus of opinion , not of the group that affects the work in question , but of the trained minds here and there that bring no prejudice to their inspection , and render their verdict in a spirit of absolute intellectual detachment .

		It is only a judgment thus pronounced that can impose itself upon the world at large , and be regis - tered as beyond appeal .

		THE TONIC OF
GEORGE MEREDITH	PERSON	'S P OETR Y .

		A frequent mood with Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	, as he greets his readers , is that of challenge .

		This is sometimes covertly mingled with portraiture .

		As he introduces
Diana Warwick	PERSON	, Lady
Blan	PERSON	- dish , Sir
Willoughby	PERSON	, or Hippias , he seems to ask your mental attitude toward cultured or sentimental women , toward sturdy egoists or puny dyspeptics .

		Again , he summons you to defend , if you have the temerity , national ^ graft ' as unfolded in the opening chapters of '
Beauchamp	PERSON	's Career . '

		He may defy you to pass severe judgment on such a desperado patriot
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 105 as ' The Old Chartist . ''

		Xotably , in his poems , the call is to personal searching of mind and soul , -- ^ the familiar couplet of invitation to enter the enchanted Woods of
Westermain	LOCATION	, ' Ye who dare , ' or the s -RCB- Tnbolic tone of ' Hard Weather , ' -- ' Interpret me the savage ■ whirr .

		Behold the life at ease : it drifts ; The sharpened life commands its course . '

		As novelist and poet alike , Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	often seems to deter rather than to encourage his readers first ventures within his pages .

		The very difficulties of approach by tortuous and brambly by-paths may increase the zeal with which one penetrates , if he has persistence , into the innermost passages of matchless revelation .

		It has been asserted that his poetry is the fitting medium of entrance into hi ^ prose .

		Through his verse his personality , mental and spiritual , is unfolded ; within his poems one may find possible interpretation for some of the most baffling enigmas of thought in his fiction .

		It is true that much of his poetry is more elusive , more freighted with artful metaphor than his prose .

		The reader is daunted by many metrical mazes in both thought and structure ; yet , in spite of the dimness of direct meaning , there breathes a tonic , * like a whiff of heather , ' `` which nourishes brain and soul and spurs one on to reach and penetrate the veiled recesses .

		For the weakling in spirit , Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	offers no heart-easing songs ; for the mental dyspeptic , he has no pre-digested literary foods .

		His favorite men and women are normal in appetite and sleep .

		For sentimental women he has a fund of biting sarcasm : recall his portrayal of ^
Irs	ORGANIZATION	.


Caroline Grandison	PERSON	who ` had relapsed upon religion and little dogs . '

		For healthy emotions , Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	has poetic tribute .

		Sen - timentality he ' would squeeze out of the world , ' whether it is exampled in ' rose pink ' ecstasies or ' dirty drab ' naturalism .

		As poet and novel - ist , he urges a sane aspect toward life . '

		Phil - osophy is foe of rose pink and dirty drab and their silly cancelling effects .

		Philosophy bids us see that we are not as pretty as rose pink , nor as repulsive as dirty drab , and instead of everlastingly shifting these barren aspects the sight of ourselves is wholesome , bearable , fruc - tifying , finally a delight . '

		In Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	's poetic fancies and medita - tions , in his roadside philosophies like ' Grand - father
Bridgeman	PERSON	' and '
Juggling Jerry	PERSON	, ' in his varied ' paneg -RCB- Tics of nature from ` Seed-Time ' to ' Spirit of Earth in
Autumn	DATE	, ' in his tragic or idyllic love-poems from ` The ?

		^ uptials of
Attila	ORGANIZATION	' and ' Archduchess
Anne	PERSON	' to ' Love in the Yalley , '' one reads the underlying exalta - tion of the elemental , exercised with sane re - straints .

		Xature , bounteous , vital , wise , is the model teacher in love , in work , in life . '

		But not
tUl Nature	ORGANIZATION	's laws and man 's are one .

		Can marriage of the man and woman be . '

		With fine , apt insight , Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	adapts his nature analogies to his varied characters .

		Juggling Jerry finds joyful tonic in ' smells of the gorse , so nutty , gold like and warm . '

		The Beggar 's refreshment is ' To lie all alone on a ragged heath .

		Where your nose is n't sniffling for bones or bear .

		But a peat-fire smells like a garden beneath . '

		Suited to the romantic trend of ` Grandfather
Bridgeman	PERSON	' is the delicate lyric of
spring	DATE	and of love , scarcely equalled in modem verse .

		• `` rhe day was a Tan-bird of
summer	DATE	: the robin still piped but the blue , A warm and dreamy palace with voices of larks ringing thro ' , L `` ok 'd down as if wistfully eyeing the blossoms that fell from its lap ; A day to sweeten the juices , A day to quicken the sap I All round the shadowy orchard sloped meadows in gold .

		and the dear Shy violets breathed their hearts out , the maiden breath of the year . '

		Earth and man must be in perfect accord .

		To read Earth aright , says Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	, to profit by its teachings , man must come into close contact with it , he must give trustful and sympathetic obedience to its laws .

		Earth is the true balancer of ratios of life .

		To one thus in alignment with
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's laws and pur - poses will come healthy physical activity , nor - mal emotions , balanced mind and hopeful spir - it .

		That strange poem , -- a modern Bacchanal , as it has well been called , -- ` Jump to Glory
Jane	PERSON	, ' is no mere travesty on muscular
Chris	PERSON	- tianity .

		It impUes a moral as well as a comic muse . '

		Jane though a jumping was a thought - ful woman , ' and to her last days of happiness and trust , her creator commends each reader .

		On the other hand , in ' The Two Masks , ' the stor -RCB- - of Melpome and
Thaleia	PERSON	, is found the teaching of normal desires for all humanitv , -- that they ' strive never to outleap our human features .

		And do Right Reason 's ordinance obey . '

		If we bend our ears to catch the meaning of the seasons as they pass , if we sympathize with the moods of the months , f retfulness will change to serene svmpathy ; so shall we , ' Like Mother Xature , Kiss the season and shun regrets , ' When such a unity of spirit has been attained , the southwest wind , roaring , dashing in fury , brings a message of use and beauty no less as - suring than the charm of woodland peace .

		To such , the dr -RCB- - sedges sing a spiritual song .

		To such , the thrush in
February	DATE	or the lark as - cending in ravished joy in full spring-tide ut - ters a similar strain : 106 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, ' 'T is love of earth that he instils !

		And ever ringing up and up , Our valley is his golden cup .

		And he the wind which overflows .

		To lift us with him as he goes . '

		With no distinct preachment on religion , Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	brings his doctrine of sympathy with Nature to a logical and spiritual climax .

		Accord with
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's laws will bring surety of a future which is not clearly revealed in vision but is assuredly promised by the processes of Mother Earth .

		` Look you with your soul , you see it . '

		AVhile he asserts no spiritual enti - ties , he emphasizes through halting mystic metres , or more simple lyrics , his comfort in a ' Right of things ' here and hereafter .

		Looking out upon the downs and hills which surround his Surrey home , he said to a visitor , ' How can any man live near to this -- near to Nature , I mean not only this beautiful inanimate Nature , but near to human nature -- and not live hope - fully ? '

		In no other of his lines does the reader come so intimately in touch with the man and the poet as in ' A Faith on Trial , ' the cry of the riven soul after the death of his wife , when doubt and darkness are scattered and the soul recovers its harmony with the Infinite by the chance sight of a pure white cherry blossom , awakening sacred associations with the happy and trustful years that the two souls had passed together .

		After an experience of a similar sort , if of diverse expression , the soul of man proclaims a future : ' Near is he to great Nature in the thought Each changing Season intimately saith , That nought save apparition knows the death ; To the God-lighted mind of man 't is nought . '

		With yet more direct and emphatic word speaks ' Seed-Time ' : ' Death is the word of a bovine day , Know you the breast of the springing To-Be ? '

		Closely in accord with the modern mood in ethics and religion is Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	's applica - tion of this faith . '

		Not in idle trust but in active service will that life expend itself which interprets aright the reading of
Earth	LOCATION	.

		Bur - den-bearing becomes a joy ; work is the solution of futile questionings about the whence and the whither . '

		Our questions are a mortal brood .

		Our work is everlasting . ' '

		For love we
Earth	LOCATION	, then serve we all ; Her mystic secret then is ours . '

		Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	lays less emphasis on the pure physical enjoyment of nature than does Whit - man ; he treats his theme with more compulsive and less intellectual force than
Browning	PERSON	.

		The student of his poems , by the reverential read - ing of
Earth	LOCATION	, is able to find the true reading of Life ; he may subscribe to a creed which in - culcates vigor of body , truth of heart , harmony and serenity of soul .

		Autobiography of ax English Reformer .

		* Few subjects that interested the English pol - itical and social reformers of the last half-cen - tury failed to rouse
George Jacob Holyoake	PERSON	to action .

		Mr.
Holyoake	PERSON	was a bom fighter .

		The cause of political freedom received most of his devotion , but he seems always to have had energy enough left to shout for or against any public question of importance .

		His life , de - tailed in ' Sixty Years of an Agitator 's Life , * and continued in two volumes of ' Bygones Worth Remembering , ' is full of matters of vital force and interest .

		From the early days , when he gained fame and lost everything else as a leader of the Chartist rebellion in
1848	DATE	, Mr.
Holyoake	PERSON	has shown an individuality so strong - ly marked and so attractive that he has been the chosen companion of statesmen and scientists .

		Gladstone ,
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	,
George Eliot	PERSON	and
George Henry Lewes	PERSON	,
Mazzini	PERSON	and
Harriet Mar	PERSON	- tineau , sought his society and his advice , and listened with pleasure and interest to his vari - ous schemes for reforming the governments of the universe and propagating ' freedom of opin - ion and industrial justice . '

		With a vanity al - most childish in its frankness , Mr.
Holyoake	PERSON	quotes
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	's estimate of him . '

		Not dwelling upon his intellectual capacity , which is high , I would emphasize my apprecia - tion of his courage , sincerity , truthfulness , philanthropy , and unwearied perseverance .

		Such a combination of these qualities , it will , I think , be difficult to find . '

		This frank egotism is evidenced on every page of ' Bygones Worth Remembering . '

		There is hardly a paragraph in which ^ I ' is not the leading pronoun .

		While this gives a raciness and a personal charm to - the book , it involves also a loss of perspective , due to Mr.
Holyoake	PERSON	's persistent placing of himself in the foreground .

		A dozen stories at least in which Mr.
Holyoake	PERSON	figures as chief actor are repeated almost verbatim in several chapters .

		Mr.
Holyoake	PERSON	was a man of strong prejudices .

		In fact , even now that he has almost reached his ninetieth year , his prejudices remain as strong as ever , and sometimes as unreasoning .

		Of
Cobden	PERSON	,
Gladstone	LOCATION	,
Harriet Martineau	PERSON	, he writes lovingly , with a distinct and ndive charm .

1905	DATE	.

		J THE DIAL , 107 statesman , to make it * defects apparent .

		Dis - raeli was certainly not above suspicion .

		He was unboundedly ambitious , selfish , inconsist - ent , too glittering to be solid , too clever to be wholly true .

		But still he was a statesman ; he did not rise to power on phrases , and whatever the greatest may think of him he was and is a popular favorite , as is indicated by the fact that his birt ; hday is more largely celebrated than any holiday of the kind in
England	LOCATION	.

		On that day , his statue in
London	LOCATION	is fairiy buried in flowers , and the square is thronged all day with those who come to do homage to his memory .


Evi	ORGANIZATION	- dently , Mr ,
Holyoake	PERSON	is judging by what he thinks should be true rather than by what is true , when he writes : ` Disraeli is a fossilized bygone to this genera - tion ; though in the political arena he was the most glittering performer of his day .

		The moral of this singular career , worth remembering , is that genius and versatility , animated by ambition without scruple , may attain distinction without principle .

		It can win national admiration , but not public affec - tion .

		All it can accomplish is to leave behind a name of sinister renown . '

		The most interesting and the most valuable chapter in ` Bygones WoriJi Eemembering ' is devoted to a recounting of what actually hap - pened on the famous
10th of April , 1848	DATE	.

		Our histories tell us of a great Chartist rebellion quelled that day through the energy , foresight , and special constables of the
Duke of Welling	ORGANIZATION	- ton .

		The day is remembered as one of the crises of modem history , one of the picturesque failures ' to rerive ancient bloodshed and rebel - lion in the name of political reform .

		Mr.
Holy	PERSON	- oake has a very different story to tell , with facts enough substantiating his version to raise an interesting question of validity .

		`
Dean Stubbs	PERSON	, in his interesting book on
Charles Kingsley	PERSON	, says : `` On the
10th of April , 1848	DATE	, a revolution was threatened in
England	LOCATION	.

		One hun - dred thousand armed men were to meet on
Ken	PERSON	- sington Common and thence to march to
Westmin	ORGANIZATION	- ster , and there to compel , by physical force if necessary , the acceptance of the People 's Charter by the
Houses of Parliament	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Could any such a lunatical statement be written by anyone , and his friends not procure a magistrate 's order for his removal to the nearest asylum !

		How were the `` hundred thousand '' to get the arms into
London	LOCATION	-- if they had them ?

		Whence were they to pro- cure them ?

		Where could they store them , seeing that at that time there was not a single Chartist meet - ing-house that was not known to be in debt , unless its rent was paid by the charity of some well-to-do sympathizer ?

		What were muskets or pikes to do against the stone walls of the
Houses of Parliament	ORGANIZATION	or the
Bank	ORGANIZATION	?

		How were cannon to be drawn from the centre of
London	LOCATION	to
Kensington Common	ORGANIZATION	with ample service of powder and shot ?

		Marvellous is the history which modern Churchmen write !

		` Politically speaking ,
London	LOCATION	has seen no tamer day than the
10th of April , 1848	DATE	.

		There was less ground for alarm than when a
Lord Mayor	ORGANIZATION	's pro- cession passes through the city .

		The procession of actual Chartists , able to leave their work to join it , could never have amounted to four thousand .

		There was not a single weapon among them , nor any intention of using it had they possessed it .

		There was absolutely nothing in the field against the Duke of
Wellington	LOCATION	in
London	LOCATION	but a waggon on which a monster petition was piled ; yet a mil - lion special constables were out , staff in hand .

		I was out with the Chartists that day , and well know how different were the facts from what is believed to be the peril of the metropolis on that day .

		Never did the craziest despotic government in
Europe	LOCATION	engage in such a political imposture .

		It was pitia - ble that the Duke of
Wellington	LOCATION	should have had no more self-respect than to compromise his great career by fortifying
London	LOCATION	against an imaginary enemy .

		The Government had plentiful information , and must have known the truth . '

		Mr.
Holyoake	PERSON	has a strong sense of humor , but his manner of writing is such that it is not always easy to discover when he is jesting and when he is in earnest .

		Most of the chapter on American manners and customs may be classed as humorous , especially that part which deals with Protection , and touches the vital defects of the system with a sure finger .

		Here , as often elsewhere , Mr.
Holyoake	PERSON	's judgment tells him clearly what is right and what is wrong .

		But in spite of his boast of impartiality , his own wav to right the wrong is to him the only way .

		He has fallen just a little behind the times in preferring political to social freedom .

		It is difficult to pronounce upon the value of Mr.
Holyoake	PERSON	's autobiography .

		Certainly , not many people will read the two rambling vol - umes , where so much is waste material .

		But for the sake of what is of intrinsic value , it is to be hoped that somebody will use * Bygones Worth Eemembering , ' together with his ' Sixty Years of an Agitator 's Life , ' as the basis of what might be made one of the broadest and most largely representative biographies of our times .

Sept. 1	DATE	, tongue , students have , in the last ten years especially , been turning to the more unchanged splendor and unbroken tradition of
Florence	LOCATION	's rival and hated enemy ,
Siena	LOCATION	, that wonderful hill-town which is still alive , Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	writes , when , ' crying ' his ' palinode , ' he now regretfully pronounces
Florence	LOCATION	dead .

		And yet the English books on
Siena	LOCATION	are still few in number .

		As material for short sketches , impressions , and the like ,
Siena	LOCATION	has in truth been used a goodly number of times .

		Mr.
Hew	PERSON	- lett , in * The Eoad in
Tuscany	LOCATION	, ' gives a fair part of one volume to his highly individual impres - sion of the town and her splendid futile people .

		A few years ago there appeared an excellent history of
Siena	LOCATION	by Mr.
Langton Douglas	PERSON	, the first one in English at all comprehensive .

		But the most interesting and illuminating as well as learned works are those , a whole series now , by Mr.
William Heywood	PERSON	, beginning six years ago with an account both critical and popular of that strange survival , the Palio of
Siena	LOCATION	, -- ' half battle , half horse-race , ' -- and ending with the book entitled ' Palio and
Ponte	ORGANIZATION	, ' in which this same subject is treated with infinitely greater completeness , allied as the special
Sien	PERSON	- ese horse-races were with races of many other varieties and with other mediasval games throughout the Communes of
Central Italy	LOCATION	.

		In this book the field of Mr.
Heywood	PERSON	's research is peculiarly his own ; and , however essential may be a knowledge of the morals of the men of those days and their attitude toward the ghostly , -- r matters more particularly dealt with by Mr.
Heywood	PERSON	in his '
Ensamples	PERSON	' of
Fra Filippo	LOCATION	, -- yet in the popular games one finds perhaps a more wholly unartificial , a more utterly pure expression of the popular taste , brutal , brave , vivid , and wonderful in spirit , in a brutal , brave , and wonderful age .

		Though the general purpose is to give ` an account of the sports of
Central Italy	LOCATION	from the age of Dante to the XXth century , ' races have the first place , in especial the famous Sienese horse-races whose inspiration was drawn from the old battle-games and whose history shows a strange latter-day survival ; but also other kinds of races , -- races of buifaloes , of donkeys , of boats , and of char - iots , foot-races of men and of women , -- races with strange uses , as divertisements , as religious observances , and as deadly insults .

		In the first division of the book is traced the curious religious character of many of these races , and especially of that one , noteworthy amongst Sienese races , run in
August	DATE	in honor of
the Virgin	LOCATION	-- the Virgin to whom the Sienese looked as their suzerain , and to whom in feudal allegiance they five times dedicated their city .

		The next division is devoted to other mediaeval games , ` the games of popular chivalry , ' be - ginning with the great game of ' Ponte ' at
Pisa	LOCATION	that was a mimic battle on a bridge -- and a veritable one too ; a game so important and so long continued as to merit its share in the whole book 's title .

		The second form of joyful battle is the ' Battle of Stones ' at
Perugia	LOCATION	, where the air above the central ' scrimmage ' was ` blackened by the showers of flying stones ' ; the third , the old Italian game resem - bling Rugby foot-ball , as it was played at Flor - ence .

		Lastly are described the various kinds of ferocious battle-games most popular in
Siena	LOCATION	, such as the '
Elmora	PERSON	' and the ' Pugna . '

		In the third and last section of the book appears the increasing control of the city 's pas - times by the ' Contrade ' or wards , divisions of uncertain origin that , with the fierce partisan - ships and bitter jealousies they still foster , give to the present ' Palio ' its turbulent mediasval character .

		They promoted various sports , both grotesque and decorative , such as donkey races that were really fist-fights waged over the body of the unfortunate animal , and the elaborate pageant of the bull-fight , the joust , and the theatrical hunt in the
Campo	PERSON	to the music of trumpets and bugles and drums .

		Directly de - scended from these more secular amusements , yet retaining the religious character of the whole sequence of races connected vdih .

		great religious festivals , the modem ' Palio ' alone of aill these remains alive .

		And so the last chap - ter is given to a vivid and vigorous description of this race that one may see twice every sum - mer even now run madly in a circle in the very heart of the city , run by the jockeys with great - er regard to the cudgelling of their enemies and their enemies ' horses than to the speed of their own , this ` Palio ' that ` is , in its origin , a blending of the
Pugna	LOCATION	, the tournament and .

		the horse-race , embellished and glorified by all the pomp and pageantry of the Trionfo and of the masquerade . '

		The combination in Mr.
Heywood	PERSON	of a thor - ough scholar ` and an all-around sportsman would seem an ideal qualification for writing of mediaeval athletics , and a row of cups high above the books in his study at
Siena	LOCATION	, his adopt - ed home now for a number of years , tells of prowess when he played foot-ball for his county and rowed for his college at
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		Later he edited a newspaper in our own West , and , having become an American citizen , played with politics , scanting in nothing the varied life there ; then turned to
Italy	LOCATION	and the scholar 's life .

		But broad human interest and a sense of humor , -- so often lacking in those who have cultivated scholarship , and scholarship alone , -- are also surely no mean assets for this work .

		The style throughout is clear and simple , -- in general not of marked quality , but occasion -

		THE DIAL , 109 ally showing such vigor and even beaut -RCB- - that one is tempted to wish for more such pages even at the sacrifice of some of the by-paths of erudition .

		Accuracy would also , one feels , not suffer by a more sparing use of Latin and Italian phrases in the body of the text , -- not to say over-familiar English quotations , though these are less indulged in than they were in some of his earlier books .

		But one prolonged sentence , the invocation to
Pisa	LOCATION	at the begin - ning of the chapter on her game of ' Ponte , ' seems positively inspired to illustrate the pre - ceding criticism , combining , as it does , in a single sentence , though not without a certain rhythm and dash , two Italian quotations , one Latin , and a hackneyed English one !

		The pages are weight -RCB- ' with foot-notes , -- but rightly so , it would seem .

		The reader for general interest and pleasantness can placidly ignore them , and the serious student of things mediae - val can verify the accuracy of Mr.
Heywood	PERSON	's scholarship , and , from the countless authorities referred to and quoted , gain many suggestions for burrowing of his own .

		The book is pleasant to handle , and those illustrations that are taken from old pictures and prints and engravings are interesting in themselves and aid greatly in understanding forgotten games .

		In fine , we would recommend to the reader by way of sam - ple the ghost story of the Blessed
Ambrogio Sansedoni	PERSON	, to whom a race was dedicated , that he may see , perhaps at the best , Mr.
Heywood	PERSON	's humor and skilful touch in the ghostliness of the adventures , comic at bottom , of the worthy and over-decorous monk .

		For st -RCB- le , one ex - ample may be quoted from the same chapter , which deals with a time when
Siena	LOCATION	, then almost steadily excommunicated , ' was literally full of devils . '

		` In those days the veil between the seen and the unseen was , at the best , exceeding thin .

		The gambler who cursed his luck might , at any moment , feel upon his shoulder the grip of demon claws .

		... the merchant , who had taken interest on his money and who was therefore branded by the Church as a usurer , must expect his last hours to be vexed by fiends , who , if he took over-long in dying , might become impatient and strangle him .

		Sometimes the neighbors of such a man would hear , above the howling of the wind and the beating of the rain , a trampling of horsemen in the narrow streets , and , when they peeped shudderingly through the cracks of their closely shuttered windows , would see a hellish company , `` terrible beyond all human imagining , '' awaiting the end .

		Lastly , the feeble , naked , wailing ghost would be hurried through the black portals into the black night ; the spectre throng would close upon it ; shrieks , as of a creature in torture , would ring shrilly through the darkness , and then grow faint and fainter in tie distance , as the demons swept it away to hell , `` biting and smiting and rending and tearing it '' .

		* It is with a feeling of surprise as well as delight that one sees on the title-page of a new book the name of
William Hamilton Gibson	PERSON	.

		The delight is scarcely lessened when one dis - covers , as in the case of the book on ' Our Native Orchids , ' that not the letter-press , but only the drawings , are the work of Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	; for the drawings are numerous , and the spirit of
Gibson	ORGANIZATION	informs them all .

		The writer of the text , Mrs.
Helena Leeming Jelliffe	PERSON	, is a true disciple of that school of real nature-study that means a long , patient , and intimate investigation of nature 's processes under all varieties of circum - stances .

		The text has , in the author 's words , ' been plainly set forth in simple English from Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	's notes , from the undescriptive sta - tistic-s of manuals of botany , and from an inti - mate acquaintance with the wild orchids them - selves . '

		Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	had published an article called ' A Few Native Orchids ' shortly before his death ; but besides this , he had completed a series of minute drawings of orchids -- the per - fect flowers , the separate and peculiar parts , and all views that might help to make plain those strange processes of cross-fertilization that
Darwin	PERSON	first discovered to an amazed and un - believing world .

		These drawings , as stated above , aided by
Gibson	PERSON	's notes and supplemented by her own observations , Mrs.
Jelliffe	PERSON	has elab - orated into the book that
Gibson	PERSON	had hoped to write himself .

		An intensely interesting book it is to all who are students of nature , or who , lacking opportunities for that , are still fond of reading the results of others ' excursions into that fascinating field .

		There is an introduction setting forth certain general facts about orchids , historical and descriptive , giving a brief account of the successive discoveries that culminated in
Darwin	LOCATION	's epoch-making statement that ' no higher plant could fertilise itself for a perpe - tuity of generations without a cross with some other individual . '

		Then follows an * Illustrated Key to the Genera of Orchids , ' seventeen in number ; and finally the descriptive text .

		110 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, and its wa3 's with its insect visitors .

		Mrs.
Jel	PERSON	-
Jiffe	PERSON	has wisely brought to her assistance any words by other writers that will make her points plainer ; but she has not relied in vain upon her own observations , and the result of her patient toil , added to the tireless industry of that master-observer
Gibson	PERSON	, has brought to American naturalists a volume , unassuming though it is , of substantial value and interest .

		It is a long step from wild orchids to culti - vated roses , but it is safe to say that there will be a wider , though perhaps not a choicer , circle of readers for ' Roses and How to Grow Them / a compilation that forms the first volume of a new ' Garden Library , ' than for the book we have just been describing .

		The little volume on roses is made up of various articles con - tributed to ' Country Life in
America	LOCATION	' and ` The Garden Magazine , ' revised and supple - mented by such material as will make the book sufficient for the average amateur , whether his ambitions are for a rose-garden , a vine-covered house or pergola , or for roses forced under glass .

		The chapters cover such practical subjects as the best location for the rose-bed , the time and method of planting , the general routine of work , including a ` rosarian 's calendar , ' and priming and spraying .

		There are special chap - ters devoted to ' Roses for Cut Flowers under Glass , ' ' Types and Races , ' ' Roses for Special Purposes , ' and ' Roses of
American Origin	ORGANIZATION	. '

		The first of these chapters is long and com - paratively detailed , showing that outdoor and indoor culture have many important differences as well as similarity of principles .

		The next two chapters will generally be consulted only when one is purchasing plants ; but it is rather amusing to see how far the classification has gone when one list is labeled * Roses for Bou - tonnieres . '

		The lists include special roses for different soils , for different uses , for different positions in the garden , and for certain typical localities .

		The last chapter , * ^ Roses of Amer - ican Origin , ' will be of interest mainly to rose fanciers , its object being chiefly ' to demonstrate what has really been achieved by the American Rose growers . '

		The book is freely and attract - ively illustrated , most of the inscriptions being amply descriptive of the purpose of the pictures . '

		The Book of Garden Design ' is an English publication , but so infused with common-sense that its principles , if not all its specific details , might be studied with advantage by many Amer - ican garden owners and designers .

		The author describes somewhat at length the different schools of garden design , recommending neither the formal nor the landscape style exclusively , but rather a judicious adaptability that shall result from a close study of all the circum - stances , -- the situation , the size of the grounds , the style and size of the house , and the general purposes of the owner .

		It is important that the garden designer should be also a practical gardener , familiar with the growth and habits of the trees , shrubs , and plants he wishes to use , in order that his work may not be undone in the future .

		Mr.
Thonger	PERSON	decries the use of the expression ' garden architect , ' suggesting that the terms are contradictory , and apt to give a wrong spirit to the work of the designer .

		He also deprecates the application of too for - mal and pretentious garden designs to the ordi - nary ' villa , ' country or suburban , which this very expression , ' garden architect , ' is apt to foster .

		N'ow all this is sturdy common-sense , and just as applicable to
America	LOCATION	as to Eng - land .

		However , the book is not chiefly contro - versial .

		It advocates first a general spirit of simplicity , avoiding both complexity and eccen - tricity .

		It then proceeds with suggestions for selecting or adapting a site , and for laying out drives and paths , which the author thinks should not be too many or winding .

		The kitchen - garden and orchard come within this scheme , and these may be made beautiful as well as necessary adjuncts to the home-grounds .

		The author considers the value of water , running or otherwise , in the garden scheme , and gives use - ful advice as to planting on its margin .

		The last four chapters are devoted to perennials , aquatic plants , trees , shrubs ^ and hardy climb - ers , and include some suggestive lists for prac - tical gardeners .

		Altogether , the little book is quite likely to be useful to those who take their gardening in earnest .

		THE DIAL 111 turns and curious surprises .

		The fact that the frivolous fancy for ornament should have laid the foundation on which the genius of the race has reared tlie great structures of money , commerce , and credit , has many parallels .

		As
Emerson	PERSON	remarked , ' the magnet was used as a toy long before it was used in navigation . '

		Economics seems to stand in far greater dan - ger of not being able to justify its title of sci - ence at all .

		In the first place , there is abso - lutely no agreement as to the use of such terms as money , rent , capital , and so forth .

		The Eicardiau theory of rent , having joined hands with
Jevons	PERSON	's theory of value , has become the fountain-head of an endless stream of technical terminolog -RCB- - , so that not infrequently the study of the subject is really being carried on in a new language for which special glossaries will soon be necessary .

		Palgrave 's ' Dictionary of Political Ec-onomy ' bristles with the new phraseolog -RCB- - on every second page .

		The whole system of modern economies rests on what Mr.
Carlile	PERSON	.

		the author of ' Economic Methods and Economic Fallacies , ' believes to be a false basis , -- namely , a confusion between the principles that are applicable in physics , and those ob - jective sciences wherein appeal to the outward fact is possible and profitable , and the prin - ciples and methods applicable to those sciences , of which economics is the most conspicuous , in which one moiety of the questions discussed may be said to belong to the sphere of matter , while another moiety belongs to the sphere of mind and of subjective investigation .

		Between these two is a great gulf fixed ; and it is be - cause the mathematical economists have under - estimated this distinction that another great gulf has become fixed between the theoretical economics of the
University	ORGANIZATION	and the practical economics of the newspaper and the Stock Ex - change .

		The reason for the chasm , as well as the way to bridge it , Mr.
Carlile	PERSON	finds in the false conception of money as an entirely negli - gible intermediary in economic relations -LRB- p. 180 -RRB- .

		Here is * ' the true view that was like enough to the false one to be mistaken for it .

		If we conceive of economic life as having come to divide itself into two departments , the one devoted to the obtaining of money -LSB- the italics are mine -RSB- , and the other devoted to the ex - pending of it -LRB- p. 130 -RRB- , we can at once get rid of the palpably false assumption of the universal irksomeness of labor .

		We can also very well do without both of those doubt - ful postulates of invincible laziness in human nature , and of inevitable misery in the world that we inhabit . '

		He justly adds that if the homo economicus were the sort of creature that such writers as
Jevons	PERSON	and
Pantaleoni	PERSON	describe him as being he would certainlv be the most contemptible as well as the most uninteresting of all existing animals .

		In the latter part of his book , Mr.
Carlile	PERSON	brin ^ the general line of reasoning to bear on the
Fiscal Problem	ORGANIZATION	, as it is called in
England	LOCATION	; and although an uncompromising free-trader , he finds himself obliged to throw overboard a number of the ar - guments that have done yeoman service in the past , but can not be expected to tell effectively on the mind of the average voter -- the * cheap - ening ' of commodities to produce mere abund - ance , the appeal to ` natural ' rights , the ex - clusive stress laid on the interest of consumers as contrasted with those of the producers , the fondness for broad generalizations regarding prices in general , and the taking of isolated cases and relying on them for the substantia - tion of universal propositions .

		He is particu - larly severe on some of the arguments of the too ingenious
Bastiat	PERSON	, and the laissez faire school .

		Mr.
Edward Atkinson	PERSON	would do well to read , ponder , and follow the advice given by the Eng - lish free-trader .

		Certainly the cause he has at heart can not gain adherents from the camp of the enemv bv such argument as the follow - ing -LRB- p. 128 -RRB- : ' ' It would be about as wise to attribute the prog - ress and prosperity of this country to a protective system , and to attribute the variations in our progress which have occurred to the change in the tariff , as it would be to count the number of red-haired children bom at given periods , endowed with a sanguine and aggressive temperament , and then to attribute to their influence when reaching adult age the variations which have occurred in our progressive conditions . '

		It ma -RCB- - also be doubted whether the science of economics will be greatly advanced by papers which the author admits were sent to press without such complete revision and condensa - tion as would have been suitable .

		Mr.
Atkin	PERSON	- son believes that ' Pacts and Figures ' are the basis of economic science ; but the fact that the large majority of men in business fancy they are protected in some mysterious way is the all-important fact with which the legislator and the tariff reformer has to deal .

		To such men the figures presented do not appeal .

		The theory , of protection may have become intel - lectually dead , as Mr.
Atkinson	PERSON	fondly reit - erates ; but the * misleading imagination ' re - mains , and to it our arguments must be ad - dressed . '

		If ' taxes on crude wool , ores , luml ^ er , dye - stuffs and chemicals ... tend to protect the foreign manufactures , ' can not the manu - facturers thus handicapped be organized into an effective
Eeform Club	ORGANIZATION	?

		If ' taxes on food and fuel , on fish , vegetables , provisions and coal increase the c-ost of living , and oppress those 112 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, who earn the least wages more than any other class , while they are of advantage to no one , -- mere obstructions to progress , ' can not the facts be presented to labor leaders rather than to the
American Social Science Association	ORGANIZATION	, so that an organized effort may be made to modify the tariff in the interest of wage-earners rather than to revise it in the interest of some particular group of manufacturers ?

		It seems to be the prime fault of certain philosophers in every field , ` from chemistry to crime , ' that they are prone to mistake cause and effect .

		Evidently what is needed in the public discussion of in - dustrial problems and policy is clear and concise statement of the simple truths and plain facts of social life , not vague meandering comment .

		Another and perhaps the chief cause of the popular contempt for political economy is the fact that most economists seem to forget the complex character of all social problems .

		In their public utterances they preach an economic doctrine and ignore the political , legal , or ethical side of the question .

		Private property in land , public ownership of certain monopolies , the different methods of taxing real and per - sonal property , trusts and trade-unions , the rela - tion of the state to each , questions of currency and banking , the tariff , eight-hour law , and the most fundamental question of all as to the organization of society on a more or less com - plete communism , -- these are only partially economic questions .

		As such they require in - vestigation by methods as scrupulously scientific as those of mathematics .

		But they also require an equally scientific study from the legal , the ethical , the political , and the social point of view .

		The application of all these laws in the particular circumstances is the duty of the legis - lator and administrator .

		It is the art of poli - tics .

		` The investigation of economic law is a strictly scientific inquiry , as much as the in - vestigation of the law of gravitation ; and the determination of economic law falls within the competence of the
University	ORGANIZATION	. '

		As Professor
Dunbar	PERSON	points out in his volume of ' Economic Essays , ' it is of far more consequence that the student should learn to reason truly than that he should perceive and accept any particular truth .

		His volume , made up largely of con - tributions to the `` Quarterly Journal of Eco - nomics , ' exemplifies to the full this vital dis - tmction and his high ideal of the duties of the
University	ORGANIZATION	teacher .

		He separates fact from fancy , and presents the results of scientific in - quiry , largely in the field of banking and cur - rency , in an eminently judicious and scholarly manner .

		It leads one to regret his unwillingness to contribute more widely to the discussion of current questions of economics and politics .

		Recent Fictiox .

		* ' Love 's Cross-Currents ' is a work of recent fiction only in the sense that it is now first published in a form likely to attract the atten - tion of the general reader .

		It was originally called ' A Year 's Letters , ' was contributed in
1877	DATE	by Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	, writing under the pseudonym of ' Mrs.
Horace Manners	PERSON	, ' to a. short-lived
London	LOCATION	paper called ' The
Tatler	ORGANIZATION	, ' and its only appearance in book form -LRB- before - the present edition -RRB- was brought about in one - of Mr.
Mosher	PERSON	's reprints .

		The author has now been persuaded by his friend Mr.
Theodore	PERSON	- Watts-Dunton to consent to its republication , which fact is made the pretext for a special note of dedication .

		Since the story is told in epistolary form , this note is a brief defence of ' that apparent compromise between a story and a play , ' with citation of
Richardson	PERSON	and
Scott	PERSON	as exemplars .

		` But , ' the author adds , ` these - are perhaps too high and serious matters to be touched upon in a note of acknowledgment pre - fixed to so early an attempt in the great art of fiction or creation that it would never have revisited the light or rather the twilight of publicity under honest and legitimate auspices , if it had not found in you a sponsor and a friend . '

		This book must be read with two facts ^ constantly in view .

		One is that the poet wrote it at an early age , many years , in fact , before its serial publication in ' The Tatler . '

		This will explain the feeling with which it touches - upon certain happenings , then not very re - mote , of European history .

		THE DIAL , ItZ older -RRB- it had not , forty years ago , been worked to death by the noveliste as it now seems to our jaded senses to have been .

		Keeping these facts in mind , the story may be read to-day with profit and interest .

		Its note is that of satirical comedy , and is struck by no light touch , but the delineations of character are subtle and artistic , especially in the case of the garrulous and malicious old woman whose letters are the longest and the most entertaining .

		The other letters are by younger people , mostly in love with other people 's wives , and bravely getting over it .

		As one of them remarks : * Our little bit of comedy slips off the stage without noise , and the curtain laps down over it .

		Lucky it never turned to the tearful style , as it once threatened to do . '

		If we may so pervert the metaphor of the title as to take it electrically , we may say that when the wires get crossed in our actual habitations , we are apt to have more of a conflagration than here results .

		We are not going to hail Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	as a great novelist on the strength of this performance , but may fairly call it a clever , almost brilliant , piece of work in a difficult form .

		After we have once mastered the intricate relationships of the persons concerned -LRB- no easy matter -RRB- and learned to recognize them by their names with - out climbing the genealogical tree over again , we may follow the development of the story with no slight interest .

		Mr.
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	gives to his new romance the happy title of ' The Fool Errant , ' and he works out the conception with much ingenuity .

		The story is the autobiography of one
Francis-Antony Strelley	PERSON	, an English Cath - olic , sent to
Padua	LOCATION	in the early eighteenth cen - tury for the completion of his education , and thus launched upon what proves to be a most extraordinary career of mingled chance and mis - chance .

		Two women serve chiefly for the shap - ing of his destinies .

		Aurelia is the youthfid wife of the learned and corpulent professor of the civil law to whose care the hero is consigned , and of whose household he becomes a member .

		Thereupon the youth falls in love with his hostess , albeit his love-making is of the most innocent sort , and much trouble ensues .

		In danger of surprise one evening when engaged in the delightful occupation of kissing
Aurelia	PERSON	's hands , he is hastily thrust into a cupboard .

		When the enraged husband discovers the pres - ence of the youthful swain , he chucks both him and his divinity into the street .

		When the re - morseful youth recovers his senses ,
Aurelia	PERSON	has vanished , and he starts on a pilgrimage to seek her out and implore her forgiveness .

		She is in reality as little the ideal which he makes of her as the actual
Dulcinea del Toboso	ORGANIZATION	was far re - moved from the ideal of the sorrowful knight of La Mancha , but it is long before he makes the discovery , and he has meanwhile a most sur - prising series of adventures .

		Divesting him - self of fine raiment and the means of support , he tramps from place to place in his search , consorting with rustics and ruflfians , strolling players and other picturesque vagabonds , he suffers all kinds of indignities , not the least of which is the incredulity with which everyone receives the confession of his pure intentions concerning the fair
Aurelia	LOCATION	.

		His conduct is indeed that of a fool as seen in the light of the easy-going morality and the gracious villainy of that land and period .

		During his wander - ings he falls in with
Virginia	LOCATION	, a beautiful con - tadina whom he saves from a life of shame , and who worships him ever thereafter with a dog - like devotion .

		Later on , when the unworthiness of
Aurelia	LOCATION	is made apparent to him , shattering the image which has hitherto been enshrined in his thoughts , he is wedded to
Virginia	LOCATION	, and the story ends with a long vista of future happiness beneath the Italian sky , for the hero never re - turns to his native land .

		The narrative is of the kind conventionally described as picaresque , and as such , we may abandon ourselves to its charm without an afterthought .

		But we can not escape realizing also -- being of the modem age , and consequently critical and sophisticated -- that the author has given us an extraordinarily inti - mate and sympathetic depiction of the life of the post-renaissance age in
Italy	LOCATION	, with its pic - toresqueness .

		its corruption , and its astonishing contrasts .

		We feel that he is simply saturated with the life of the time and the color of the environment , and that he has reproduced these things with marvellous fidelity .

		This is the chief title of the book to praise , and a high title it is .

		Father
Sheehan	PERSON	is by way of becoming a full - fledged novelist .

		As the author of ' My Xew Curate * and *
Luke Dehnege	PERSON	' he has won his way to many hearts by virtue of his genial portrayal of Irish life and character , and the very human quality of his writing made us tolerant of the large admixture of theological discussion with which those books were bur - dened .

		In * Glenanaar , ' his latest novel , his theological ballast is thrown overboard , and he gives us a plain storj ' of deep interest .

		It is a story that begins some seventy-five years ago , with the farcical trial of a batch of Irish con - spirators , and the dramatic intervention of O'Connell just in time to save them from an unjust conviction .

		Out of this episode is spun the thread of the narrative , which runs down into our own time , and is chiefly concerned with the descendants of an informer -- that most despised of mortals -- whose perjured tes - timony had nearly done a number of his fellow - countrymen to death .

		It is a book deep-rooted 114 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, in its racial element , interpreting Irish char - acter with an eye by no means blind to its faults , but always with penetration and tender sympathy .

		The tale is somewhat disconnected in sequence , but is sweet and wholesome , and , withal , not lacking in touches of humor .

		Its atmosphere is
Catholic	LOCATION	, as a matter of course , but not , as we have already stated , in any dog - matic or controversial sense .

		` The Apple of
Eden	ORGANIZATION	, ' by Mr.
E. Temple Thurston	PERSON	, is another book with a Catholic at - mosphere , but it is burdened with a problem , and its note is of revolt rather than acceptance .

		It offers a powerful and unpleasantly-stated ar - gument against the institution of celibacy , and shows us , in the life of a priest , how nature will have its way in spite of vows and renuncia - tions .

		It opens with a scene in the confessional , and develops , through the untoward workings of fate , into a tale of passion , in which the priestly hero all but succumbs to the very temptation confessed by his penitent in the opening chap - ter .

		It is a story of considerable power , but its frankness exceeds the bounds of what is ar - tistically permissible .

		When our future historian , in some age con - trolled by a more rational conception of suc - cess than now obtains , shall look back to our present epoch of frenzied materialism , seeking to explore its psychology , the novelists will be found to have provided him with some of the most important of his documents .

		They have themselves not infrequently given a false color - ing to their facts , and been far from definite in their sense of ethical values , but they have been zealous to reflect the unlovely phases of our life , and , although sometimes overawed by the gigantic forces they have found at play in our commercial civilization , have at least been searching in their analysis , and vivid in their portrayal .

		In the qualities of truth and vitality , such a book as Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	's ' Memoirs of an
American Citizen	ORGANIZATION	' takes high rank .

		Nor can such a book fail even of a sort of passionate interest to us .

		who see illustrated every day , in lives that are near and possibly dear to us , the conditions which it depicts , and the motives which it represents as prevailing .

		This sort of interest in such a book , we trust , will eventually disappear , but the social-historical value will re - main for the instruction of our posterity .

		Read to-day , it is not particularly instructive , for we know too well all that it tells us , but it may prove helpful for admonition and example .

		Yet even in this capacity , the story does not seem to realize its full possibilities .

		We are no advo - cates of an obtrusive morality in fiction , but it seems to us that Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	is something too much of the dispassionate observer , that he re - presses too much the note of indignation , that his attitude suggests too much of acceptance , too little of protest and repudiation .

		The im - plicit moral is evident enough , and a stern one it is , but selfishness and corruption are given too complete a triumph , honesty and altruism are too thoroughly worsted in the struggle , to satisfy the dem ` ands we may rightfully make of a work of art .

		In this book , the unscrupu - lous central character achieves every kind of material success , and the characters that in any way stand for decency are presented to us in a light that makes them appear weak and ridicu - lous .

		Professions of principle are met with a covert sneer , and efforts to act in accordance with any motive higher than selfishness are made to appear contemptible .

		This they doubtless are in the eyes of the ` American citizen ' whose dubious rise to wealth and political honor is here outlined , but the author need not view them -- nay , is bound not to view them -- from that angle of observation .

		Such must be our fundamental criticism of this autobiography of the country boy who becomes a pork-packer in
Chicago	LOCATION	, rises to fortune by corrupt practices , and purchases a seat in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	as the crown of his life of dishonor .

		The author persuades us to follow the career of this arch-criminal witii a certain degree of s -RCB- Tnpathy , and does little or nothing to encourage our sympathy with those of his characters who shrink from mak - ing terms with the mammon of unrighteousness .

		The story seems to be rooted in bitter cynicism and to embody the very philosophy of despair .

		` The Accomplice , ' by Mr.
FTederick T'revor Hill	PERSON	, is the story of a mysterious crime , but offers a variant upon the usual form of the detective yam , in that the account of the trial occupies the whole book .

		Through an imex - pected turn in the proceedings , the villain is revealed in the person of the counsel for the defense , and the young woman on trial is trium - phantly acquitted .

		This book is above the av - erage of its class , and will provide an hour of entertainment for the most jaded of readers .

		The novel of American politics has become a conspicuous feature of our current literature , and no season now passes without making sev - eral additions to this category . '


John Van Buren	PERSON	, Politician , ' is an anonymous publication which gives us a close view of governmental matters in
New York City	LOCATION	and
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		Who - ever the writer may be , he knows intimately the workings of Tammany and of the corrupt ring that controls legislative affairs at
Albany	LOCATION	.

		He draws for us a full-length portrait of Rich - ard
Croker	PERSON	, and many of his secondary figures will doubtless be recognized by readers who are cognizant of the local sitiiation .

		The book has
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 115 no style , and but slight interest considered as a story .

		Its implied ethics , moreover , are of a highly dubious character .

		A much better book , one that has style -LRB- of a sort -RRB- , an interesting framework , and characteri - zations of no mean order of merit , is ^ The Ultimate Passion , ' by Mr.
Philip Verrill Mighels	PERSON	.

		Here the specific scene is
N'ew York City	LOCATION	, but the arena of the conflict depicted is national , for the hero is a presidential candidate .

		How he places himself in the hands of the cor - ruptionists who dictate nominations and con - trol policies , making all the time the mental reservation that he will kick over the traces when once occupying the seat of power , how he lends himself to their nefarious schemes and acquiesces in their infamous methods , how he even pledges himself to marry the daughter of the arch-conspirator , -- these are the matters with which the plot is mainly concerned .

		Mean - while , he secretly marries the woman of his choice , and the revelation of this fact , at almost the last moment , brings about the collapse of the whole structure of political machination which he and his associates have spent many toilsome months in rearing .

		This is a very vigorous book , inspired by genuine passion , and making a skilful progress to its logical conclu - sion .

		And we have no doubt that it offers an essentially truthful presentation of the way in which our national destinies are manipulated by the great moneyed interests .

		If such illum - inating expositions should be sufficiently multi - plied , we may hope that they will eventually have the effect of arousing the dormant indig - nation of an outraged people . '

		Miss
Bellard	ORGANIZATION	's Inspiration , ' the latest of the many books that Mr.
Howells	PERSON	has given us , has a charm altogether out of proportion to its pre - tensions .

		It is no more than a novelette in dimensions , and its story is of the simplest , but displays in the telling a very delicate art .

		There are six people concerned --
Miss Bellard	PERSON	and her fiance , the aunt and uncle with whom they spend a few days in the country , and a married couple who are their guests by chance .

		This couple proves to be singularly mismated , and the spectacle afforded by their bickerings so alarms the heroine that she discards her lover , lest some such future may be in store for them also .

		She speaks by way of explanation , about ' that strange sort .

		of feeling I had that we would be like them , if we married , and that there was not room in the world for two such quarrelsome couples . '

		Lateron , when the jangling pair have reached the point of imminent di - vorce , the rejected lover makes the following plea for a resumption of the old relations : ' If they are separated for good and all , do n't you see that it gives us our chance ? '

		The argument is convincing , and these are the words in which the heroine describes her capitulation : * The point was a very fine one , and I kept losing it ; but he never did ; and he held me to it , so that when he did go away , I promised him that I would think about it .

		I did think about it , and before morning I had a perfect inspiration .

		My inspiration was that when I was so helpless to reason it out for myself , I ought to leave it altogether to him , and that is why we are going to be married in the
spring	DATE	. '

		This is the ortho - dox conclusion , if brought about by whimsical means , but we can not escape a certain concern for the young man 's future . '

		The Unwritten Law , ' by Mr.
Arthur Henry	PERSON	, is a novel born of the generous sympathy that inspired ' Les Miserables , ' a sympathy that may easily degenerate into mere sentimentalism , and comes dangerously near to doing so in the pres - ent instance .

		According to philosophers of this bent , society is really responsible for the sins of the individual , and when they pay the penalty which society imposes they are to be regarded rather as martyrs than as anything else .

		Mr.
Henry	PERSON	sustains this thesis in three leading cases : One of them is afforded by a man who loses his savings as the result of a bank defalcation and turns to counterfeiting as a means of live - lihood ; the other two are afforded by girls who easily allow themselves to be seduced .

		It is , of course , quite possible for a writer to present cases like these so artfully as to enlist all our sympathies on the side of the offenders , but the undertaking is ethically more than ques - tionable , and can be defended only by sophistry .

		And there is no kind of excuse for the excessively plain speaking in which this book indulges upon subjects that every consideration of decency de - mands should be veiled .

		The book is one of present-day life in
New York	LOCATION	, and impresses one as the work of a reporter rather than of a constructive novelist . '

		A
Madcap Cruise	ORGANIZATION	' is well named .

		A reck - less youth , nephew and ward of a millionaire , by guile and strategy , gets possession of his uncle 's yacht , and , accompanied by a fellow - conspirator almost equally deep-dyed in vill - ainy , crosses the
Atlantic	LOCATION	to join the girl he loves , and from whom the fiat of the aforesaid uncle has sought to keep him apart .

		The moral of the story is that love laughs at uncles and all such obstructive agencies .

		It is badly in need of a moral of some kind , since the piratical proceeding of the youth is hardly to be con - doned upon any of the ordinarily-accepted the - ories of rectitude , while equally open to question is the episode in which his companion , left in charge of the yacht in Italian waters , uses it 116 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, for the felonious purpose of aiding an archae - ologist to get away with certain ill-gotten treasures from the clutches of Italian law .

		This escapade prospers , no less than the primary act of piracy , and the latter is forgiven by the en - raged uncle because it accidentally saves him from the wreck of his fortunes at the hands of an accomplished swindler .

		This story might fairly be called an extrav - aganza , and this title is actually applied to the next book on our list , alluringly named ' The Venus of
Cadiz	LOCATION	. '

		Here we have the love-story of a
Kentucky	LOCATION	mushroom-grower and an unso - phisticated heiress , with incidental complica - tions involving several military gentlemen , a lady 's companion , a shady countess , a decadent novelist , several moonshiners , the boy
Pete	PERSON	, and the dog Pup .

		The last-named character is the only one who comes completely to grief , being despatched with many bloody wounds by the decadent novelist .

		In the case of this book , the plot is naught , and the manner everything .

		As one startling development follows another , we are left at once breathless with excitement and convulsed with mirth .

		A racy and rollick - ing book it is , warranted to dispel the most chronic case of blues .

		The novels of Miss
Elizabeth Robins	PERSON	do not always make pleasant reading , but they always have ideas wrought into their texture , and this intellectual quality compels for them a respect - ful and attentive hearing .

		In ' A Dark Lan - tern ' we have , first of all , a close parallel to the situation presented by the '
Dorothea	PERSON	' of ' Mar - ten
Maartens	PERSON	. '

		The innocent heroine has a dis - sipated father , and so completely has his char - acter been concealed from her during her youth that she is slow to realize the full depth of its degradation .

		Tlien , also as in '
Dorothea	PERSON	, ' a German prince appears as her lover , and is the object of a romantic affection .

		Here the two plots diverge , for the lover in this case is an unworthy person , who seeks first to betray the girl , then , reluctantly , offers her a morganatic marriage , which she naturally rejects with scorn .

		About midway in the book the real hero , who has made a brief early entrance , comes to the centre of the stage , there to remain until the final fall of the curtain .

		He is a physician of brusque and bearish manners , as ignorant of the amenities of life as he is skilful in his profession .

		His very harshness seems to fas - cinate the heroine , who becomes his patient , and surprises herself by falling in love with him .

		Her infatuation leads her to desert the world of fashion , and bury herself in the village where he has his country home , and to which he makes a brief visit at the end of the week .

		All this time there is no marriage , for the physician is a very canny person , whose contempt for the weaker sex is unbounded , and who is determined to take no chances .

		When the heroine has been reduced , in his view , to a sufficiently abject condition , he magnanimously consents to a legal union .

		All this , as may readily be seen , af - fords material of which much may be made by as brilliant a writer as
Miss Robins	PERSON	, who almost -LRB- but not quite -RRB- forces upon us acceptance of the extraordinary relation thus outlined .

		Her characters certainly have vitality , and an ex - traordinary power to interest us -- even the un - prepossessing character of the ` dark lantern , ' or ' black-magic man , ' who so unaccountably fascinates the heroine .

		Miss Murfree 's latest novel , ' The Storm Cen - tre , ' is a story of the Civil War , slight in sub - stance , and of moderate interest only .

		Some - thing of this writer 's earlier magic still attracts to her descriptive passages , but invention and characterization are far below the level of her best previous work .

		The scene is in
Tennessee	LOCATION	, mostly in the home of a Southern gentleman , and the principal characters are the members of his household and a Federal officer who ac - cepts his hospitality during a prolonged period of illness .

		This officer falls under suspicion of having aided the enemy -LRB- at least through neg - ligence -RRB- in a raid which has disastrous results for the Federal campaign , and he is court-mar - tialled in consequence .

		He is sentenced to death , but a review of the case acquits him , and his romance -- for a woman is actively con - cerned -- ends happily .

		There are some adora - ble children in the story , and an amusing study of an old negro retainer of the family .

Bryant	PERSON	, and the The new life of
Bryant	ORGANIZATION	, by Mr. hirth of poetry
William Aspenwall Bradley	PERSON	, in in
America	LOCATION	.

		^ ^ 6 ` English Men of Letters ' series -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , adds nothing of novelty to the already published facts of the poet 's life ; but readers will find the volume a convenient , clear , and thoroughly readable biography .

		Mr.
Bradley	PERSON	has followed strictly the chronological method in his story , discussing the productions of a period in connection with the activities amid which they had their inspiration , -- a method which is logical and illuminating to all concerned .

		In his estimate .

		of
Bryant	PERSON	's place in literature , the author is appreciative and gener - ous .

		To him it seems that criticism , ` especially American criticism , ' has done the poet scant justice .

		He speaks of
Bryant	PERSON	as ` the most im - aginative , perhaps , of all our poets save Foe . '

		Yet he is discriminating in his praises and his claims .

		He tells the story of ` Thanatopsis ' more intelligibly and more completely than some earlier biographers .

		` To a Waterfowl ' he con -

		THE DIAL 117 siders the crown of
Bryant	ORGANIZATION	's verse .

		Perhaps it is worth while to suspend our criticism at this jKjint long enough to recall the fact that in
1821	DATE	``
William Cullen Brj-ant	PERSON	, twenty-seven years of age and not altogether unknown , published his first volume , a pamphlet of forty-four pages , containing just these eight poems : ` The Ages , ' ` To a Waterfowl , ' ` Translation of a Fragment of
Simonides	PERSON	, ' ` Inscription for the Entrance to a Wood , ' ` The Yellow Violet , ' ` Song ' -LRB- The
Hunter	PERSON	of the West -RRB- , ` Green River , ' and ` Than - atopsis . '

		As Mr.
Bradley	PERSON	states , this unpreten - tious volume indeed ` marks the birth of Ameri - can poetry just as surely as
Irving	LOCATION	's `` Sketch - Book '' marks the birth of American prose lit - erature . '

		The comparative unproductivity of the poet 's later years , his almost complete absorp - tion in political and editorial activities after
1832	DATE	, with the resultant decline of poetical as - piration , leads Mr.
Bradley	PERSON	into some interest - ing , if futile , conjecture .

		For instance , in speak - ing of
Bryant	PERSON	's selection of
Xew York	LOCATION	as a residence in
1825	DATE	, he suggests that
Boston	LOCATION	might have proved a better field of operations .

		The atmosphere of
New York	LOCATION	, literary and social , he thinks may have been unpropitious for the poet 's development .

		` In
Boston	LOCATION	or
Cambridge	LOCATION	he would have felt the stir of intellectual life about him , and his poetry , perfect in form , might have gained in depth and feeling . '

		With reference to the political stand of the poet jour - nalist , while not altogether commending Bry - ant 's attitude toward abolitionism , the biog - rapher devotes a paragraph to an interesting comparison of
Bryant	PERSON	and
Whittier	LOCATION	, with this remark : ` It -LSB- abolitionism -RSB- was in the main the most ideal impulse that has ever been felt in American politics .

		Whittier sacrificed his art to become the poet of a movement .

		Bryant kept outside of movements and preserved his art intact , yet with a certain loss in wide human sjTnpathy .

		It is significant how little his poetry reflects of the excitement of the time in which it was written . '

		The discussion of
Bryant	PERSON	as a nature-poet is particularly suggestive .

		His rela - tion to
Wordsworth	PERSON	and to other so-called poets of nature is well stated .

		Dwellers in the Mid - dle West will take especial pleasure in the ac - count -LRB- here given in more detail than in any other life of
Bryant	PERSON	-RRB- of the poet 's visits to
Jacksonville	LOCATION	and
Princeton	LOCATION	,
Illinois	LOCATION	, where his brothers and finally all the remaining members of his family had settled .

		It was in the pio - neer days -LRB- the first visit was in
1832	DATE	-RRB- when
Bryant	PERSON	gazed for the first time upon these ` un - shorn fields , boundless and beautiful , ' pro- foundly impressed by the encircling vastness swept with the shadows of the clouds , aflame with tossing golden flowers , the haunt of hawk and wolf and deer .

		This was the inspiration of ` The Prairies . '

Legg	PERSON	, -- ` Select Docimients Illus - trative of the History of the French Revolu - tion , and the Constituent Assembly ' -LRB-
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- -- it might be inferred that this work was another ` source book , ' provided primarily , as the selections are not translated , for the usef of advanced college classes .

		The editor apparently does not have so restricted a body of readers in view .

		His aim is to tell the stoiy of the Revolution ` almost in the words of the Frenchmen of the time . '

		For this pur - pose he has made his selections chiefly from the newspapers , on the supposition that a newspa - per 's comments are a far better indication of the currents of opinion than are memoirs , gen - erally written years after the events they de - scribe , or even contemporary private letters .

		This is true enough , although many letters at once recur to the mind , the statements of which are more significant than newspaper comment , -- for example , Sir
Samuel Romilly	PERSON	's letter , writ - ten late in
July , 1789	DATE	, describing for a
Paris	LOCATION	friend the first impression made in
England	LOCATION	by the fall of the
Bastille	LOCATION	.

		Another illustration is the series of letters written by
Camille Des	PERSON	- moulins to his father , from
May to July	DATE	of the same j-ear .

		Mr.
Legg	PERSON	's selections are made with excellent judgment , and are all interesting .

		Such journals as the political part of the Mer - cure de
France	LOCATION	, edited by Mallet du Pan ,
Mira	PERSON	- beau 's Courrier de
Provence	LOCATION	, and
Brissot	ORGANIZATION	's Patriate franq < iis are most frequently drawn upon .

		The characterization of Brissot 's jour - nal as ` open to all the most fantastic absurdi - ties that ever entered the brain of a French - man unbalanced by the excitement of the ctd - bute gSnSrale ' seems too severe , especially for the numbers printed in
1789	DATE	.

		In his biograph - ical note , the editor inserts the rather snobbish fling that
Brissot	PERSON	was the son of a pastry cook .

		Occasionally the texts of laws vital to the com - prehension of the period are inserted in the body of the work , while others fill about one hundred pages of the appendix .

		Each group of selections is prefaced by an introductory note , explaining the circumstances which provoked the comments or discussion .

		The special value of this work is that it makes accessible the opin - ions of the leading journals ?

		upon the most im - portant events of the first two j' ears of the Revolution .

		Hitherto only those within reach of the largest libraries could become acquainted with this material .

		It is to be hoped that Mr.
Legg	PERSON	's enterprise wiU meet with such encour - agement that he will publish a similar work for the later vears of the Revolution .

		Older than
Rome	LOCATION	itself by perhaps four cen - turies , the city of
Gubbio	LOCATION	reached its most flour - ishing condition during the early years of the fourteenth century ; the population had in - creased to fifty thousand ; a native school of painting was established , noble buildings were erected , and even the commtmes of
Florence	LOCATION	and
Siena	LOCATION	and
Perugia	LOCATION	did not disdain to seek an alliance with
Gubbio	LOCATION	.

		To-day the town has barely a tenth of this population , but it still weai 's its mediaeval aspect and continues many 118 THE DIAL -LSB-

16th of May	DATE	.

		-- Covering a somewhat similar ground to the foregoing is the book called * Pictures in
Umbria	LOCATION	' -LRB- imported by
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons -RRB- , by Miss
Katharine S. Macquoid	PERSON	.

		It is , however , a much less original and valuable work .

		In fact , the text is so trite and prosaic that it gives the impression of being written merely for the sake of furnishing a setting for the fifty original il - lustrations from sketches made by
Thomas R. Macquoid	PERSON	,
R. I. Perhaps	PERSON	this is a sufficient jus - tification , however ; for the pictures are certainly charming .

		One never sees the hill-towns of
Umbria	LOCATION	too often , nor dwells too long among them ; and next to the pleasure of actual pres - ence is the satisfaction conveyed by picturesque presentation of these choice bits of scenery or works of art by a genuine artist .

		Perugia and
Assisi	LOCATION	furnish the principal subjects ; but there are scenes also from
Spello	LOCATION	,
Cortona	LOCATION	, and
Lake Thrasymene	LOCATION	.

		A human document of surpassing interest to those who have stud - ied the life and career of Wag - ner is
William Ashton Ellis	PERSON	's compilation of letters , published under the title of `
Richard Wagner	PERSON	to
Mathilde Wesendonck	PERSON	' -LRB- imported by
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons -RRB- .

		The matter contained in the volume includes letters to and fi * om
Mathilde Wesendonck	PERSON	, designed to shoAV the sentiments which actuated
Wagner	PERSON	to begin and carry on what some are pleased to refer to as a dual life , and will go far to modify the gen - eral opinion of this relationship as held by Eng - lish-speaking people .

		The reader is left to a certain extent to form his own opinion upon the progress of events , from the private letters and extracts from diaries Avhich are presented very fully .

		That the biographer has not pur - sued this cause from want of sympathy with his subject is evident from the introductory re - marks and subsequent comments , in which he leaves no doubt of his sincere and hearty ad - miration of
Wagner	ORGANIZATION	's character and career .

		If the work has been performed conscientiously , -- that is , if there has been no improper discrim - ination in the selections from private corre - spondence , nothing omitted which Avould tend Wagtier and
Frau Wesendonck	PERSON	to dcA'elop the real character of the man , -- the plan is unobjectionable , even admirable , as it brings the man himself verA ' near to the reader .

		Of
Mathilde	PERSON	, Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	says : ` Her personality ?

		No one admitted to the honour of
Frau Wes	PERSON	- endonck 's society during the
last thirty years	DATE	of her life -- and here I can speak from personal experience , hoAvever slight -- could for a moment belieA'e her to ha \ ' e ever been the heroine of Avhat the baser sort imply Avhen they speak of a '' Tristan-and-Isolde romance . ''

		This placid , SAveet
Madonna	ORGANIZATION	, the perfect emblem of a pearl , not opal , her eyes still dreaming of Nirvana , -- no !

		emphatically no !

		she could not haA-e once been swayed by carnal passion .

		And these let - ters , in bulk and in detail , most flatly contra - dict that implication : nay , more , -- they prove the justice of my old contention , not mine alone , that the second act of
Wagner	PERSON	's drama excludes all possibility of his Tristan , his Isolde , being victims to a coarse desire .

		In these letters all is pure and spiritual , a
Dante	ORGANIZATION	and a
Beatrice	LOCATION	; so must it have been in their intercourse .

		From my own impression of their recipient -- Avhom I first met in that sad year at
Bayreuth Avhen	LOCATION	the master was no more -- it Avas that of the silver moon reflecting a sun that has set long since .

		Not a word ever fell from her lips on such a love as is revealed here ; but every ac - cent of her voice , the gathering moisture in her eye , spelt Avorship ; and from her it Avas I ear - liest learnt a truth which added years have sim - ply A-erified : that in
Richard Wagner	PERSON	Ave have more than a great -- a profoundly good man . '

		In summing up the result of this published cor - respondence , Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	asks , Would
Wagner	PERSON	and
Frau Wesendonck	PERSON	have been happier had they left their respective homes together ?

		And he contends that their love had sublimated into something too ethereal , by the time of its decla - ration , not to run risk of dispersion by the in - evitable shocks of daily intercourse .

		` Besides a gifted brain and inbred tact , it needed an un - usually strong character really to be a prop and moderator to a genius Avhose ideas of practical life had become so largely tinged with that transcendency which stamps his artAvorks . '

		When she died , in the month of
August , 1902	DATE	,
Mathilde Wesendonck	PERSON	Avas making ready for the presentation of these lettei 's to posterity .

		THE DIAI .

		119 sire for more fare of the same sort from those formidable ` twenty-eight folio volumes ' of man - uscript .

		The letters of this gouty , port-drink - inff , free-living , pluralist churchman to his equally prosperous and likewise pluralist crony , have something in their tone and in the pic - ture they present of society life and manners , and of ecclesiastical squabbles , that reminds one of
Carlyle	PERSON	's opinion of the century to which they belong .

		To him it was a swindler-century , opiUent in accumulated falsities ; a century that erelong became unconscious of being false , so false had it grown ; so steeped in falsity , so fraudulent-bankrupt , the measure of its in - iquity so full , that it needed a French Revolu - tion to square the account .

		It was a century in which , as we read in
Pyle	PERSON	's letters , a King of
England	LOCATION	could tell an
Archbishop of Canterbury	ORGANIZATION	to his face that ` he was a man of a little dirty heart ' ; a non-compliment that the prelate in question .

		Archbishop
John Potter	PERSON	, appears to have felt that he deserved ; at any rate , the roy - al displeasure broke his heart , whether dirty or clean , and he died soon afterward , calling forth from some read -RCB- - rhymster the epitaph , -- ' Alack , and well-a-day .

		Potter himself is turned to clay . '

		Mr ,
Hartshorne	PERSON	's labors have at least fur - nished a useful source-book for historians of the period , however lacking it may be in the con - tinuous , absorbing interest that lures the spell - bound reader , blissfully insensible of dog-day sultriness and ener \ - ating heat , from page to page and from one delightful chapter to its more entrancing successor .

		Mirabeau and The French Revolution apparently the French remains a favorite field for the Revolution .

		display of a somewhat spectacular rhetoric .

		The most recent instance is Mr.
C. F. WarAviek	PERSON	's ` Mirabeau and the French Revolution ' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The illustrations are in keeping with this treatment of the subject .

		One of them represents a peasant lying prostrate in his vine - yard , ridden down by the gay sportsmen who are gallopping thoughtlessly on toward an artistic sunset .

		The author 's manner becomes more direct as soon as the details of
Mirabeau	ORGANIZATION	's story absorb his attention .

		His remarks on the condition of
France	LOCATION	under the old regime and of the course of the Revolution are , however , often misleading and inexact .


M. Aulard	PERSON	, the distinguished professor of the history of the Revolution in the
University of Paris	ORGANIZATION	, has estimated that about twenty years are required to make oneself acquainted with the materials for the political history of the Revolu - tion .

		Perhaps so long an apprenticeship is not indispensable , but the lack of it renders hazardous the attempt to describe the careers of men like
Mirabeau	LOCATION	,
Danton	PERSON	, or
Robespierre	LOCATION	, whose lives lose their significance unless the historical back - ground is faithfully portrayed .

		Many scenes of the Revolution arouse the imagination , which can be kept in restraint only by constant contact with the facts in the case .

		In this book , instead of what occurred on the
night	TIME	of
July 12 , 1789	DATE	, there is a fanciful picture of revolutionary horrors .

		The Bastille is said to have been ` in a complete state of defence , ' although De
Launay	PERSON	had done nothing toward accumulating a store of pro \ `` isions and there was no oven in the fortress except one for pastry .

		It is an error of another kind to say that Sieyes ` schemed with
Napoleon	PERSON	and
Ducos	PERSON	to establish the
Directorate	ORGANIZATION	. '

		The volume on
John Bunvan	PERSON	in
Tjohn	LOCATION	* iZ : : : l the ` Literary Lives ' seriesJScrib - ner -RRB- is written by Mr. W illiam
Hale White	PERSON	, better known as `
Mark Rutherford	PERSON	. '

		His name on the title-page is a guarantee of good work , and the book proves to be a sym - pathetic , even a devout , study of its interesting theme .

		A footnote gives some indication of the present commercial value of
Bimyaniana	LOCATION	.

		The warrant for
Bunyan	PERSON	's arrest in
1676	DATE	, a brief document given in reduced facsimile by Mr.
White	PERSON	, was last year acquired by Quaritch for 305 # .

		This six-months imprisonment of
1676	DATE	was made especially memorable by the writing of the ` Pilgrim 's Progress . '

		Mr.
White	PERSON	finds a curious likeness between
Bunyan	PERSON	's fiend-haunted melancholy and
Johnson	PERSON	's recurrent spells of dark despair .

		He writes : ` It is strange , by the way , that
Johnson	PERSON	resembled Buuyan .

		His spectres haunted
Johnson	PERSON	, and the `` History of My Melancholy , '' which he once thought of writing , would undoubtedly have reminded us of another history by the author of the `` Pilgrim 's Progress '' which he loved so well . '

		The closing paragraph of this scholarly biography is sig - nificant as showing a certain excellent balance of Hebraism and Hellenism -LRB- to use again Mat - thew
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's convenient terms -RRB- in the writer .

		` Puritanism has done noble service , ' he says ; ` but we have seen enough of it even in
Bunyaa	LOCATION	to show that it is not an entirely accurate ver - sion of God 's message to man .

		It is the most distinct , energetic and salutary movement in our history , and no other religion has surpassed it in preaching the truths by which men and nations must exist .

		Nevertheless we need Shakesi > eare as well as
Bunyan	PERSON	, and oscillate be - tween the `` Pilgrim 's Progress '' and `` As You • Like It . ''

		We can not bring ourselves into tmity .

		The time is yet to come when we shall live by a faith which is a harmony of all our facul - ties . '

		Popular beliefs Probably no book regarding pop - and practices tilar beliefs - and practices has of
Great Britain	LOCATION	, jjj ^ ^ j ^ jvidcT vogue than
Brand	ORGANIZATION	's ` Popular Antiquities of
Great Britain	LOCATION	. '

		Brand was himself but an editor , and his ` Popular An - tiquities , ' printed in
1777	DATE	, was really a revised edition and enlargement of a book by the Rev.
Henry Bourne	PERSON	, published in
1725	DATE	under the title of ' Antiquitates Vulgares . '

		Brand 's book was republished and edited by
Ellis	PERSON	in
1813	DATE	; a later edition of it , the one best known to the present generation of readers , was brought out by Mr.
Carew Hazlitt	PERSON	in
1870	DATE	.

		The book before us is really the old Boume-Brand-Ellis-Hazlitt book in new form , with the title ` Faiths and Folk-lore ' -LRB- imported by
Charles Seribner	PERSON	's Sons -RRB- .

		Mr.
Hazlitt	PERSON	has thrown the material 120 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, into dictionary style , cutting and separating the older articles into brief passages arranged in alphabetical order .

		One may still read Brand with satisfaction , but the work before us is a constant irritation .

		Three legitimate courses were open to Mr.
Hazlitt	PERSON	: he might have re - issued his Brand of
1870	DATE	without change ; he might have given the same matter in this new form ; he might have given the whole of Brand in dictionary style and added to it so much of the result of Folk-lore study since
1870	DATE	as would have made the Avork a reflection of pres - ent thought and knowledge .

		He has done no one of these things .

		The reader has a right to demand of a dictionary , -- and Mr.
Hazlitt	PERSON	calls the book before us a dictionary , -- that it should be complete and symmetrically developed .

		Mr.
Hazlitt	PERSON	has added some material to the old book , but neither in quantity nor in quality is it worth while .

		Most of it is newspaper clippings culled at random , and both in ari-angement and subject shows no sense of proportion or definite plan .

		jn regions of Not on any known map are ` The ■ enchantment .

		Enchanted Woods ' to be sought near at hand .

		q ^ , found ; they exist wherever the beholder has sufficient grace of poetry in heart and eye to discover them .

		There - fore are they rare ; yet quite as often ex - isting within sight of one 's own doorstep as when one has travelled far afield in search of them .

		This is the theory of
Vernon Lee	PERSON	, when she chooses this title for a book -LRB-
John Lane	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- about the places that she loves .

		Whither her footsteps go , the Genius of Peace can not long remain hidden .

		In these thirty chapters , there is no orderly sequence , no effort .

		The writer has found that the most interesting places are those which we stray into , or just deflect toward , as we wander for the sake of friends or work , or even in humbler quest of cheapness of living or benefit to health .

		How many times lias the wearied sight-seer in foreign lands dis - covered this by sad experience !

		How often has • it been forced upon him that the best travel is not that which he has done for travelling 's • sake , and that the rainbow 's pot of gold was really at the end of his own garden-plot , and not over-seas !

		The habitual grace of
Vernon Lee	PERSON	's style is present in these pages , and her unfailing vivacity makes her the most delight - ful of couriers and engaging of companions .

		rrhe French - ^ volume from
India	LOCATION	on the Revolution French Revolution irresistibly re - seen from
India	LOCATION	, ealls to mind the
Citizen Tipu	ORGANIZATION	, whom the Revolutionists relied upon to drive ` the minions of Perfidious Albion ' from
Madras	LOCATION	, if not from all
India	LOCATION	.

		The little book by Professor
P. A. Wadia	PERSON	, of
Gujarat College	ORGANIZATION	,
Ahmedabad	LOCATION	, on ■ * The Philosophers and the French Revolution ' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- has , however , only this somewhat remote geographical association with the
Sultan of Mysore	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is an essay written to show the falsity of the view which ascribes the Revolution largely to the teachings of the eighteenth century philosophers .

		Professor
Wadia	PERSON	regards both it and them as illustrations of the extreme tenden - cies of that individualism which had its beginnings in the Renaissance .

		The philosophers simply gave skilful expression to currents of feeling and thought which ran through all French intellectual life .

		In the same way the author finds the attacks on religion and the riotous tendencies to have been characteristic of the French people long before the Revolution began .

		Were it within the scope of this essay , doubtless he would have pointed out that all , opinions as well as conduct , were evidence that the defects of the old regime were so grievous as to provoke protest of the most radical type .

		The Works of Lucian of
Samosata	LOCATION	, ' with a few omissions -LRB- either because of questionable author - ship or by way of expurgation -RRB- , translated from
Jacobitz	PERSON	's -LRB- Teubner -RRB- text by Messrs.
H. W. Fowler	PERSON	and
F. G. Fowler	PERSON	, are published in a neat four-vol - ume edition at the
Oxford Clarendon Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		The translation is for the general reader , being notably idiomatic , especially in the Dialogues .

		This edition of one of the most modern of the ancients is a veri - table boon , and we give it a hearty welcome .

		The single volume of nine hundred pages into which have been collected ' The Philosophical Works of
Francis Bacon	PERSON	' -LRB- Button -RRB- will prove a boon to scholars who have to be economical in the matter of library space .

		The reprint includes the greater part of the monumental edition of
Ellis	PERSON	and
Spedding	PERSON	, with their prefaces and notes , and it would be a verj ' special student indeed who would read any of the matter now omitted .

		Professor
John M. Eobertson	PERSON	is the editor of this most accept - able volume .

		` The Flying Lesson ' is the title given by Miss
Agnes Tobin	PERSON	to a small volume of translations from
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	, published by Mr.
William Heine	PERSON	- mann .

		This is Miss
Tobin	PERSON	's second venture of the sort , and includes ten sonnets , two canzoni , a ballata , and a double sestina .

		Miss
Tobin	PERSON	writes fairly good Petrarch and very good poetry , which is so much more than most translators give us that it would be ungracious to insist upon the essential untranslatability of her chosen poet .

		The little book is exquisitely printed , and adorned with a beautiful etched frontispiece ` in morte di Ma - donna
Laura	PERSON	. '

		In
Beryl D. de Selincourt	PERSON	's ` Homes of the First Franciscans ' -LRB- Dent-Dutton -RRB- , we have a successful attempt to show to what a degree the character and teachings of St.
Francis	PERSON	of
Assisi	LOCATION	were shaped and illustrated by his surroundings .

		Fortunately , the intervening centuries have dealt kindly with the Franciscan haunts ; one may still penetrate into the heart of the past in the solitudes elected by
Francis	PERSON	and his followers .

		Naturally ,
Assisi	LOCATION	takes the first and longest place in the book ; but also there are ample chapters on the
District of Lake Thrasymene	LOCATION	,
Monte Casall	PERSON	,
the Valley of Eieti	ORGANIZATION	, La
Terna	ORGANIZATION	, etc. , which help to explain those legends of miracle which soon began to spring up around the
Pover	PERSON	- ello .

		Monsieur
Paul Sabatier	PERSON	, the great biographer of the Franciscans , furnishes a brief preface to the volume ; the illustrations are from charming photo - graphs made expressly for this work ; and there is an outline map showing those portions of
Umbria	LOCATION	,
Tuscany	LOCATION	, and the
Northern Marches	LOCATION	, wherein the Franciscan community lived their intense inner life .

Stokes	PERSON	's NEW Autumn NOVELS A SERVANT of the PUBLIC By
ANTHONY HOPE	PERSON	Author of ```` Quisante , '' `` Phroso , '' `` The Prisoner of Zenda , '' etc. . ''

		It is easy to be enthusiastic about the story .

		It is psychologic -- but with a difference , the differ - ence being the bright and compelling interest of Mr.
Hope	PERSON	's dialogue , and the smiling sanity of his spirit .

		Imagine much that is best in
Meredith	LOCATION	or
James	LOCATION	, and all that is best in
Anthony Hope	PERSON	, and you have a fair idea of ' A Servant of the Public ' It is not the conventional story of the stage , with glib talk of the greenroom , and intimate glimpses ' behind the footlights . '

		It is the story of an actress off , rather than on , the stage -- an analysis of the theatrical , perhaps ' artistic , ' temperament . ''

		NOTES 171 ANNOUNCEMENTS OF FALL BOOKS ... 172 -LRB- A classified list of books announced for publica - taoB during the coming Fall and
Winter	DATE	season . -RRB-

		BOOKS OF TH E COM ING SEASON .

		The long list of publications announced for the season just now opening -- a list comprising upwards of fifteen hundred titles -- is now be - fore us , and invites to pleasurable anticipations .

		Persons of intellectual and literary interests derive from such a list as this much the same sort of satisfaction that devotees of music and the drama derive from an advance statement of managerial plans accompanied by lists of plays and visiting celebrities .

		The lover of books , also , has an advantage over the amateur of the theatre and the concert-room in the fact that the delights to which he looks forward will be the more certainly accessible , for they will not be limited by the special restrictions of time and place that belong to play going ; nor will they -- thanks to the blessing of free libraries -- be denied hun by their cost .

		One may exam - ine such a list as the present with the practical certainty that any book it contains may be read if one will , soon after publication ; provided , of course , that one lives in some fairly populous community .

		As is our custom in connection with this ` Fall Announcement ' issue of The Dial , we now select for particular mention such few of the forthcoming books as seem to promise the most marked satisfaction , -- remembering , how - ever , that literature has its disappointments no less than its joys .

		Our selection is confined to the small number of categories that are most closely related to literature , leaving untouched the vast tracts devoted to such subjects as art and science , education and religion , and making no account whatever of the hundreds of books designed as holiday gifts for old and young .

		Ajnong books seriously concerned with lit - erature , the collection of Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	's * Letters ' would seem to be the most significant thing in prospect .

		These letters have already appeared in several European languages , and they are now to be given to the public of the two Eng - lish-speaking countries .

		The late Lady
Dilke	PERSON	's ` Book of the Spiritual Life ' will be certain to make a deep appeal to serious minds .

		Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	, so recently with us , will be kept in mind -LRB- if that were necessary -RRB- , by the publication of the two essays that he read before various private audiences
last winter	DATE	, and by Miss
Elisabeth Luther	PERSON	Car/s elaborate discus - sion of his work .

		We note that after many 156 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, years ' delay the French Ambassador has pre - pared for publication the second volume of his * Literary History of the English People / a work that will be all the more welcome for the long time we have had to wait for it .

		Prom - ising collections of literary essays are ' French Profiles / by Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	; ` The Torch / by Pro- fessor
Woodberry	LOCATION	; and ' Greatness in
Litera	LOCATION	- ture / by Professor Trent .

		In the field of literary biography , several highly important works are announced .

		Per - haps the most important is Bielschowsky 's ex - tensive biography of Goethe .

		It may not be alt-ogether amiss to mention here the musical biography of Tschaikowsky , by the brother of the great composer .

		Mrs.
Pennell	PERSON	's '
Hans Breitman	PERSON	/ Mrs.
Marie Hansen Taylor	PERSON	's * 0n Two Continents / and
Colonel Higginson	PERSON	's ' Parts of a Man 's Life / are three contributions to the history of American literature that can - not fail to be interesting .

		British biography will be enriched by Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	's very thorough work on
Charles	PERSON	and
Mary Lamb	ORGANIZATION	and by Mr.
Herbert Paul	PERSON	's life of
Froude	PERSON	.

		Volumes on
Marvell	ORGANIZATION	,
Browne	PERSON	, Mrs.
Gaskell	PERSON	,
Charles Kings	PERSON	- ley , and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, will be added to the ` English Men of Letters ' series .

		To the `
American Men of Letters	ORGANIZATION	/ the long-delayed volume on
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	will be added , and also one on
Lanier	PERSON	.

		The ' French Men of Letters ' will be auspiciously inaugurated by Professor Dow - den 's Montaigne and
M. Brunetiere	ORGANIZATION	's
Balzac	LOCATION	.

		Professor
Woodberry	PERSON	will contribute a small volume on Swinburne to the ' Contemporary Men of Letters ' series .

		From books about literature to books of lit - erature the transition is natural ; and here , of course , we are confronted with the great fact of the dominance of the novel .

		We give a brief list chosen with much hesitation from several hundreds of titles : '
The House of Mirth	ORGANIZATION	/ by Mrs.
Edith Wharton	PERSON	; ' The Eeckoning , ' by Mr.
E. W. Chambers	PERSON	; ` The Coming of the Tide , ' by Miss
Margaret Sherwood	PERSON	; '
Coniston	ORGANIZATION	/ by Mr.
Winston Churchill	PERSON	; ' The Wheel of Life , ' by Miss
Ellen Glasgow	PERSON	; ' A Sword of the Old Frontier , ' by Mr.
Eandall Parrish	PERSON	; ' The Man of the Hour / by Miss Alice French ; and ' Eaoul : the Story of the Theft of an Empire , ' by Mr.
J. W. Ludlow	PERSON	.

		Against these Amer - ican titles we may set the following English ones : ' The Story of a Simple Soul , ' by Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	; ` The Mayor of Troy / by Mr.
A. T. Quiller-Couch	PERSON	; ` The Tents of Pan / by Mrs.
Craigie	PERSON	; ' The Hundred Days / by Mr.
Max Pemberton	PERSON	; ` The Lake , ' by Mr.
George Moore	PERSON	; ' Helianthus / by '
Ouida	PERSON	; ' ' Starvecrow Farm , ' by Mr.
Stanley J. Weyman	PERSON	; and ' The Trident and the Net , ' by the author of \ The Martyrdom of an Empress . '

		Probably a bigger work of fiction than any of these will be the translation of `
Peter	PERSON	and
Alexis	PERSON	' from the
Eus	ORGANIZATION	- sian of Merejkowski , completing his * Christ and Antichrist ' trilogy .

		We aJso learn from the English reviews that a new novel by Mr.
Watts-Dunton	PERSON	may be expected before long .

		The writer last-named naturally suggests Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	, which reminds us to say that his ' Tragedies , ' in five volumes , are now appearing in
England	LOCATION	, and we shall doubtless soon have them in an edition uniform with the poems .

		The only announcements of new poetry having any special significance are the '
Nero	PERSON	' of Mr.
Stephen Phillips	PERSON	; Mr.
E. W. Gilder	PERSON	's ` In the Heights ' ; the poems of that brilliant young
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	graduate , the late
Trumbull Stickney	PERSON	; and a collection of ' Last Poems ' by the Eng - lish lady who called herself '
Laurence Hope	PERSON	, ' and whose tragic death in
India	LOCATION	was chronicled about a year ago .

		A final paragraph of this conspectus may be given to a few important works not classifiable under the above headings .

		In history we note M. Hanotaux 's ' Contemporary
France	LOCATION	/ Cap - tain
Mahan	PERSON	's ' Sea Power in Its Eelation to the War of
1812	DATE	, ' Professor Breasted 's ' A Historv of
Egypt	LOCATION	/ Professor
H. T. Peck	PERSON	's ` Twenty Years of the Eepublic , ' and the volume on ' Na - poleon and His Times ' in the *
Cambridge Modern History	ORGANIZATION	. '

		Pleasant reading is sure to be afforded by the '
London	LOCATION	Films ' of Mr.
How	PERSON	- ells , and ` The Fields of
France	LOCATION	/ by Mme.
Mary Duclaux	PERSON	-LRB-
Mary A. F. Eobinson	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The reader of philosophical leanings will eagerly await Professor Hoffding 's ' Philosophical Prob - lems , ' Professor
Jastrow	PERSON	's treatise on ' The Sub - conscious , ' and Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	's chapters on ' The Eeconstruction of Eeligious Beliefs . ' '

		A His - tory of Political Theories ' will be made more than readable by the brilliant pen of Professor
Dunning	PERSON	; while Professor
Shaler	PERSON	's ` Man and the Earth ' will provide food for serious eco - nomic reflection .

		Finally , as the aftermath of the recent war , we note the prospect of many books about
Eussia	LOCATION	, among which Dr.
Dillon	PERSON	's ' The Birth of the
Eussian Nation	ORGANIZATION	' will as - suredly take a high place .

		ON STYLE IN LI TERATURE .

		Everybody talks about style , and no one knows what it is .

		Writers who ought to be better informed by experience speak of it as if it were something that could be bought at a shop and wrapped up in brown paper .

		They talk of its being acquired , -- which in any real sense is as impossible as to add a cubit to one 's stature .

		They discuss it as if it were one cer - tain thing -- whereas it is a veritable Proteus .


Leibnitz	PERSON	's principle of indiscemibility applies
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 157 to it more than to any other matter .

		If no two leaves in a forest are alike , far less are the styles of any two writers alike .

		Every author has some sort of a style , good or bad .

		And of good style probably the most that can be said is that it is the quality in books which makes and keeps them readable .

		If a man has a rich nature , a full mind , a knowledge of the grammar and vocabulary of his language , the only advice he needs in regard to style is the direction which an old pilot gave for navigat - ing the
Amazon	LOCATION	: * Keep between the banks , and go ahead . '

		Style is indeed the product of the whole man .

		It must show the form of his soul , eagle - winged or serpent - winding .

		There will ring in it an echo of all his exultations , agonies , divina - tions , darings .

		It must betray the resources of his reason .

		What logic and lucidity he is pos - sessed of will come out in the clear designs , the ordered architectural arrangement of his work , both in its entirety ' and in its clauses and sen - tences .

		It must exhibit his physical instincts in its sensuous reaching for concrete images , its organization of words into form and color and music .

		The reason we associate style with prose rather than with poetry is because verse is a balance of all these qualities .

		Without in - spiration , without ordinance , without the vivid and sounding collocation of words , it falls to the ground and becomes nothing .

		It can not sail on one wing or hop on one foot .

		Poetry is all style ; whereas prose usually has one or another of the attributes of style missing or in excess , and our attention is thus arrested , and from its lack of balance we give the thing a name .

		The two great masters of English verse in the eighteenth century were mighty wielders of words .

		In the face of the fact that our ordi - nary speech is shot through with their lines and phrases , it seems senseless as well as un - grateful to deny them the title of poets .

		But their verse was an invasion of prose .

		Of style , they only employed that part which belongs peculiarly to prose composition , logical order , lucid statement , wit and wisdom .

		They aban - doned the Orphic utterance ; they did not achieve the sensuous realizations of poetry .

		Wordsworth remounted the tripod of inspira - tion , and
Keats	PERSON	waved anew the Bacchanalian thyrsus ; and since their time there has been no cause to lament the lack of fire or form in style .

		Eather , if anything , the physical ele - ment of style has been too predominant .

		It is in connection with words rather than with ideas that most people think of style , -- as if words were not merely the symbols of thought .

		In a moderate number of instances there mav be some subtle aflfinitv between the look and sound of words and their meanings .

		Onomatopoeia of course exists .

		Oftener the aflfinity is due to associations which words may have acquired .

		They may bring with them a trail of glory from the past , -- or , like good servants , a letter of recommendation from their previous employers .

		They may be forgotten metaphors , or coins from the treasure-houses of foreign tongues .

		Sometimes their fitness is due to their noble physiognomy or lordly sound .

		Mesopotamia thrilled one bosom with sacred awe .

		Great poets have always known how to use magnificent names with effect .

		Yet , after all , it must have occurred to many people that the English race at least has rather made a failure of that which is perhaps its chief work -- its Dictionary .

		T ^ ere is no reason why all our words should not have been created fit and noble , -- ^ as the whole Spanish army was once created
Hidalgo	PERSON	.

		As it is , the great mass of our words are low or indifferent , -- good enough for bread-and-butter uses , or the purposes of trade , but decidedly lacking in distinction .

		Aristocratic vocables are as rare as dukes and princes .

		It would take a treatise to show this in detail , but I will give a few instances , prem - ising that my own judgment is the only rule of rank which I have used .

		The most commonly used names of things -- nouns -- of our language are rather bad than good .

		* Ocean * is grandly mouth-filling and pictorial , but * sea ' is ignoble , * air ' at least questionable , * sky ' weak and thin .

		The clipped dissyllable * heaven ' is decidedly poor .

		` Firmament , ' however , is magnificent , and ` Paradise ' fine .

		` Earth , ' ` sun , ' ` stars ' are three low plebeian symbols for the total splendors of the visible world .

		Turn to the words describing man 's own person .

		His im - perial majesty has certainly been modest . '

		Man ' is a pretty poor sound to attach to the prince of creation . '

		Face ! '

		what a word is that to emblem forth the great soul 's apparent seat ! '

		Eyes , ' ' nose , ' ' mouth , ' ' arms . ''

		` legs , ' -- could there be a worse commodity of vile names ?

		Then take the inward attributes of our human state : ' Brain ' is bad ; ' soul ' only so-so ; ` heart ' indifferent .

		Truly , as far as words go , man has a poor chance of figuring in any prose writers golden stvle .

		Send him abroad , like
Adam	PERSON	, to view and name his pos - sessions !

		It is to be hoped that
Adam	PERSON	had bet - ter taste than to call his cave a ` house . ' '

		Mansion ' or ' palace ' might do . '

		Garden , ' ' valley , ' ' forest ' are good ; but ' farm , ' ' plain , ' ` tree , ' ` sheep , ' ` road , ' ` horse , ' ` cow , ' ` bird , ' ` bee , ' and a myriad more , are very middling at least . '

		Metropolis ' is fine , and gave
Keats	PERSON	a glittering line , -- ' Upon the gold clouds metro - 158 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, politan / but * city ' is affected , and ` town ' -- let us pronounce it ' taown ' at once and be done with it .

		Then take our pronouns , ' I , ' ' he , ' ' she , ' * it , ' ` who , ' ` whom , ' ` you , ' ` they , ' -- why , it is like the neighing of horses or the hoot - ing of owls !

		On the whole , then , we have not made a success of the names we most use . '

		Birth ' is not a pretty word , and ' life ' and ' death ' hiss at each other like angry geese .

		I do not want to fly in the face of my mother language , but as a fellow-sufferer with Mr.
Pater	PERSON	and Mr.
Alden	PERSON	I ask how I am going to make style out of words like those ?

		Turn to the verbs .

		` To be , ' ` do , ' ` act , ' ' make , ' ' go , ' ' come , ' have a certain brevity of use and command , but they are dull and creeping enough .

		The fact that we have so often to prefix the sign of the infinitive to our verbs is another offense of the language .

		It has the look of a consumptive policeman conveying a squat tramp to the station-house . '

		To love ' has a cooing sound , and ` to desire ' is noble .

		But for the most part the verbs denoting the usual occupations of life are vulgar in the ex - treme . '

		To buy , ' ' sell , ' ' eat , ' ' fight , ' ' run , ' ` talk / ` sleep , ' ` lose , ' ` gain , ' -- these and in - numerable others have countenances of no mark or likelihood .

		Contemplating them , one feels a glow of admiration for
Walt Whitman	PERSON	when his picturesque genius soars to the heights of ` ab - squatulate ' or ' skedaddle . '

		It is to the adjec - tives that we must mainly look for what of physical comeliness our speech affords .

		Many of them are veritable patricians , and show like Al - cibiades or
Cosmo de Medici	ORGANIZATION	amid the vulgar rabble of our nouns and verbs .

		`
August	DATE	, ' ` splendid , ' ` noble , ' ` gorgeous , ' ` magnificent , ' ' graceful , ' ' beautiful / ' indomitable , ' -- such words adorn the pages of prose or verse , -- ' Pride In each port , defiance in each eye , I see these lords of human speech pass by . '

		And here , because I am acting as the Devil 's Advocate of words , I would note another fact which tells against my side : ` Beauteous is a vile word , ' says Polonius .

		It is so !

		But why ?

		I can not tell .

		There must be something in its physiognomy which does not suit our minds .

		On the whole , then , owing partly to the enor - mous proportion of monosyllables , partly to the prevalence of sibilant and dental sounds , the words of the English language are overwhelm - ingly ugly and unmusical .

		A word of two or more syllables may be a melody , or at least a cadence ; a word of one syllable is merely a noise .

		The ` caw-caw-caw ' of the crow or the ' tweet-tweet-tweet ' of the sparrow are not mu - sical -- the trills and arias of the catbird or nightingale are .

		Words that sing themselves are surely more advantageous to the builder of sentences than words that halt and grunt and groan .

		The writer of English has to labor with his raw recruits of vocables , to make them stand at attention or walk in file ; when he wants them to give voice together , he finds that they are dumb or hoarse or hissing .

		All the more honor to him if he succeeds !

		Ac - cording to those who find in mere words the secret of style , English literature should be very nearly styleless .

		But , on the contrary , beyond all other literatures it is drenched and irradi - ated and alive with style .

		Even its bad styles -- those of
Johnson	PERSON	or
Carlyle	LOCATION	, for example , -- are not like the bad styles of other literatures -- merely ponderous or commonplace .

		They are striking , original , full of interest .

		To sum up , then : the English language is preeminently a language of ugly and discordant words ; the English literature is preeminently a literature of style -- of glowing and appropriate expres - sion ; therefore words in themselves have very little to do with the evolution of style .

		I have said that the idea of style is usually associated with prose ; and also that there are as many styles as writers .

		But prose style in English falls into three great species , to one or the other of which most pieces of composition may be referred .

		The first of these species is the prose which
M. Jourdain	PERSON	was delighted to find that he talked .

		It is the plain , straight - forward , unadorned language of life .

		But we must beware of thinking that this style , as it exists in the pages of great writers , is without art .

		There is perhaps as much art in the plain - ness of Swift , the naturalness of
Defoe	PERSON	, the sim - plicity of
Bunyan	PERSON	, as in the ordered and far - wheeling sentences of Milton or
Burke	PERSON	.

		Let anyone try to do a piece of work like
Franklin	PERSON	's autobiography , and he will discover the diffi - culty of the method .

		Always the necessary in - strument of men of action , and for direct nar - ratives of real experiences , this style has been revived in recent years for the use of fiction , and in fact for many other purposes .

		Much of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's and
Stevenson	PERSON	's work was done in it .

		though at their best they put off corduroy and donned silks and satins and velvets .

		The style is so simple and wholesome and good that there is little more to be said about it , except that self-consciousness is fatal to it ; fine writing , unless very skillfully concealed , its ruin .

		The second prose species in English is the ornate , elaborated , monumental , periodic style -- the so-called prose poetry .

		De Quincey , de - fending this his favorite style , somewhere asks what a writer of the calibre of Swift would have done if set such a theme as
Belshazzar	ORGANIZATION	's feast and told to develop all the implications and consequences of the story .

		Probably Swift would have made something awful of the mat -

		THE DIAl , 159 ter .

		But it may be doubted whether the few strong words which the Bible devotes to the in - cident are not more impressive than any fan - tasia which
Jeremy Taylor	PERSON	or Milton or De Quincey himself could have written around it .

		Unquestionably , the lofty prose flights of these writers are superb , but there is a touch of fal - setto in them .

		They try to give the sensuous effect of verse without verse 's sensuous appar - atus of rhythm and rhyme , without its allowed elisions and inversions which tend to concentra - tion and concreteness .

		And , in the second place , they are an imitation of the poorest kind of poetry -- descriptive poetry .

		Great poetry does not linger and loiter ; it strides on from action to action , from thought to thought , and gives its descriptions very largely by means of hints and flashes and implications .

		In the set pieces of
Ruskin	PERSON	and De
Quincey	PERSON	and
Jeremy Taylor	PERSON	, we can not see the forest for the trees .

		They set out to describe some single matter , -- a lark rising in the air ,
Joan lyArc	PERSON	on her scaffold , a lonely tower fronting the sea ; but the subject bourgeons and eflBoresces in their hands ; troops and battalions of ideas and im - ages come to illustrate or elaborate it .

		These end by hiding the central theme .

		By the time we hare got to the middle of the description we have forgotten the beginning ; and when we are done we do not know whether we are standing on our head or our heels .

		I do not in the least deny that such work is valuable and wonderful .

		But it is not quite the real thing either of poetry or prose .

		But there is a perfect , crowning , golden style in English prose .

		It is a style whose colloquial ease is not the home-bred rusticity of our first species , whose sparkling polish is not the im - pasto brilliancy of our second .

		It is simple from richness , glowing from within .

		It is keen and flexible and glittering , like a
Damascus	LOCATION	blade .

		It is terse .

		It does not tire .

		It does not over-dwell .

		The supreme master of this prose is Shakespeare ; his co-rival in art , though , alas , not in matter , is
Congreve	ORGANIZATION	.

		Gold - smith reigns on a little lower level ; and there is no fourth to rank with them .

		Their prose gives the essence of character in immortal words .

		We recognize it as our real inheritance of speech , which we all ought to share , but which we have somehow been cut out of .

		No girl ever said like
Rosalind	PERSON	, ' A star danced , and under that I was bom ; ' but the phrase gives ns at once a picture of the heroine and a precious pearl of language to put away among our verbal treasures .

		No fine lady ever uttered such a speech as this of Millamant 's : ' What is a lover that it can give ?

		One makes lovers as fast as one pleases , and they live as long as one pleases , and when one pleases they die ; and then , if one pleases , one makes some more . '

		All the adorable coquetry of the women is in those words , and they are , besides , a set of cadences which affect the literary student with delight and despair .

		No wandering bear - leader ever put forth a claim to be a gentleman in the words of
Tony Lumpkins	PERSON	's boon com - panion , * Tho 'd I be obligated to dance a bear , my bear only dances to the genteelest of tunes , '' Water Parted '' or the Minuet in
Ariadne	LOCATION	.

		* The clown rises before us in this sentence , which must tickle the fancy forever .


Sheridan	PERSON	has a skyrocket imitation of this style .


Hazlitt	PERSON	and
Charles Lamb	PERSON	, as a reward for their love of it , sometimes attain to its pure perfections .

		Thackeray struggled to achieve it all his life ; but his success is at best quite ques - tionable .

		Once , in a dispute with
Tennyson	PERSON	, he asserted his ability to equal Catullus .

		He re - canted this opinion the next morning , in a note of becoming modesty ; and probably he has by this time recanted the opinion which he held longer and more seriously , that he could write better than
Congreve	PERSON	.

		Strange as it may seem ,
Dickens	PERSON	is really the more consummate mas - ter of this style .

		In the scenes where the Wel - lers appear , in those between
Dick Swiveller	PERSON	and the Marchioness , above all in those which have to do with
Sairey Gamp	PERSON	, he too gives ns the essence of character in immortal words .

		Mrs.
Gamp	PERSON	's ' Put the bottle on the chiml ^ ' - piece so I may wet my lips with it if I be so dispoged ; ' the Marchioness 's pathetic refference to the imagination which was required to sea - son the lemon-peel punch ;
Sam Weller	PERSON	's philos - ophy of love-letters ; the elder
Weller	PERSON	's descrip - tion of Mr.
Stiggins	PERSON	, -- these , and a hundred other passages , place
Dickens	PERSON	not much below the i ^ erfect three .

		Cardinal
Newman	PERSON	and
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	are perhaps the best modem masters of this style in serious matters .

		And the famous scene where Arminius investigates ilr .

		Bottle 's mind , qua mind , shows in
Arnold	LOCATION	the creating flash .

		This species of prose , informal , easy as an old shoe , is , as it were , made for letter-writing ; and as a consequence the great English letter-writ - ers .

		Gray ,
Cowper	PERSON	,
Keats	PERSON	,
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	, are among its best exponents .

		Keats 's prose , in - deed , is almost pure
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		Among Americans ,
Poe	PERSON	has the glitter though hardly the ease of the style ,
Lowell	PERSON	its unction , and
Emerson	LOCATION	its inward irradiation .

		There is one kind of prose style which , I think , has hardly been naturalized in English .

		It is the style of Thucydides and Tacitus -- the style , that is , of one who says everything almost without words .

		` THE SHADE OF THE BALKANS . '

		-LRB- To the Editor of
The Diai	ORGANIZATION	, . -RRB-

		Since the reviewer of ` The Shade of the Bal - kans , ' in your issue of
August 1	DATE	, has made im - proper use of a private letter , I am sure you will allow me to correct him in a public letter .

		It happens that in ` The Shade of the Bal - kans ' -LRB- which is a collection of Bulgarian folk-songs , etc. , and related essays , for which Pencho Slaveikoff , Dr.
E. J. Dillon	PERSON	and myself are responsible -RRB- we say we do not believe that ` The Bard of the
Dimbovitza	PERSON	' is , as it pretends to be , a collection of Roumanian folk-songs , but that it has been manufactured -LRB- and very well -RRB- by Car - men
Sylva	PERSON	, Miss
Helene Vacaresco	PERSON	, and
Miss Alma Strettell	ORGANIZATION	.

		The f olk-lorists have always class - ed this book with
Ossian	PERSON	; and their reasons for so doing have been set forth in our volume for the benefit of the general reader .

		Our object was not , as your reviewer suggests , to satisfy our superflu - ous malice ; there is in
Slaveikoff	LOCATION	's essay a com - plete examination of Bulgarian Popular Literature , its origin , its heroes , its methods , its villains , and not the least interesting part is concerned with
Stephen Verkovich	PERSON	, who forged the celebrated `
Veda Slovena	PERSON	, ' with
Wenceslaus Hanka	PERSON	who ` discovered ' his own poems in the vault of the church-tower of
Koniginhof	LOCATION	, and so forth .

		The .

		value of his work would therefore have been less if nothing had been said about ` The Bard of the Dimbovitza , ' since the
Rouman	PERSON	's culture has been , from * the Middle Ages imtil recent times , so closely interwoven with the Bulgar 's -LRB- I need only refer to Dr.
Ivan Shishmanoff	PERSON	's : well-known pamphlet , ` Der Lenorenstoff in der Bulgarischen Volkspoesie , ' wherein the prevalence and varia - tions of this one song throughout the
Balkans	LOCATION	are discussed -RRB- that such a collection of folk-songs as Miss V. 's can not exist or have existed .

		I shall not troubl.e to repeat the scientific rea - sons -LRB- as , for example , that in the present condi - tiop of the Roumanian tongue even Emenesco , the best of their modem poets can not give utterance to such songs as
Miss V.	LOCATION	has collected from the lips of an old gardener , a nurse , etc. , so that these gifted retainers presumably speak French , in which language the songs were first published -RRB- .

		But let me say that
Teodorescu	PERSON	, the greatest of Roumanian folk-lorists , has never been able to find any songs like these ; no more have any othei ` learned and patient folk-lore searchers , ' as Miss V. herself admits in the dedication of a later volume .

		On the contrary , the wise men of
Bucharest	LOCATION	have ridiculed the book 's pretensions ; and for this Miss V. calls them unpatriotic !

		One can not hope that every man who writes reviews of folk-song books should be a folk-lorist ; but I confess that it is disheartening when the proofs -LRB- which we thought , it worth while putting for the general reader 's sake , and which all f olk - lorists already knew -RRB- are utterly ignored , and your reviewer proceeds to say , ` There can , of eoui-se , be no doubt as to the authenticity of the songs .

		... It is pi-eposterous that a reigning Queen , ' etc. , etc. ... `
Helene Vacaresco	PERSON	is a maid of honor to this Queen . '

		Allow me to repeat the words of Moliere : ' On peut etre hon - nete homme et faire mal des vers . '

		Your reviewer does not know how these songa were made , and I can not enlighten him , as I am far from being in
Miss V.	LOCATION	's secrets ; but , judging from a later volume which has her name alone upon the title-page , I shall say that the quality which gives them value -- their aesthetic beauty -- is owing to the genius , not altogether unknown , of Miss Alma Strettell .

		My private letter to your reviewer was written on account of one he sent to Slaveikoff .

		When I met S. last
spring	DATE	in
Paris	LOCATION	, he gave me the letter , which was a request for further information as to Miss V. -LSB- He wrote likewise to that lady asking her to tell him whether the songs are authentic !

		May I comment upon this by quoting your re - viewer on some other lines which , says he , ` are touching in their sweet simplicity ' ? -RSB-

		S. 's health being bad , his sister had replied to the letter , and at his suggestion I sent a supplementary reply .

		It is the treatment of this reply which I consider grossly unfair .

		In the first place , I informed the inquirer that the ienunciation of
Miss V.	LOCATION	has for the sake of simplicity been added to S. 's essay , but that as a matter of fact I had compiled it from the words of S. and of others .

		` Such a procedure , ' says your reviewer , ` casts suspicion upon the whole book . '

		How ludicrous !

		If an engine is being cleaned by
Samuel Smith	PERSON	, the driver , and his three competent assistants , we may say , for the sake of simplicity , that the engine is being cleaned by
Samuel	PERSON	.

		Why need I add in parenthesis that this proof came from Dr.
Dillon	PERSON	, or that another one was contributed by Mr.
Misu	PERSON	, the Roumanian agent and philologist in
Sofia	LOCATION	, or that others again were provided by Professor Dr.
Gaster	PERSON	, the famous Roumanian scholar ?

		They all agreed with each other , S. agi-eed with all of them , and as moot of the proofs did not originate with them but with him it is not very reprehensible , I think , if all of them are grouped under his name .

		Against these experts , by the way , your reviewer brings up two French gentlemen who , he sajrs , champion Miss V. , namely :
M. Gaston Paris	PERSON	and
M. Andre Bellessort	PERSON	.

		He says the former is one of the greatest French authorities on the subject .

		That , permit me to remark , is exceedingly faint praise .

		With
M. Bellessort	PERSON	I am unacquainted , but I am sorry that his two years ' study and travel in
Roumania	LOCATION	have not brought him nearer to
Teodorescu	LOCATION	,
Emenesco	LOCATION	, Dr.
Gaster	PERSON	, and others who have studied
Roumania	ORGANIZATION	for a lifetime .

		In the second place , I informed your reviewer that in the
London	LOCATION	`
Bookman	PERSON	' for
April	DATE	I had reviewed Miss V. 's later book , in a signed article .

		He blames me , apparently ' , for writing it with sar - casm .

		Heavens !

		must all reviews be written with streaming eyes ?

		He blames me for writing it at all .

		Surely it is better that reviews should be written by those who are in some degree ac - quainted with the subject than by those who are

		The
Bath Club	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	,
Aug. 20 , 1905	DATE	-LSB- Mr.
Bernard	PERSON	's letter is so immoderate , so full of inaccuracies , exaggerations , and mis - statements , that space will not allow a discus - sion of it at length .

		In the first place the reviewer can not plead guilty to Mr.
Bernard	PERSON	's charge of having made improper use of a private letter .

		Struck by M!r .

		SlaveikofFs bitter denunciation of Miss Vacaresco 's ' The Bard of the Dimbovitza ' , in - volying the Queen of
Roumania	LOCATION	, and feeling the injustice in the manner of the attack , the reviewer wrote to him stating that he was re - viewing her later book and his own , and asking hie opinion of ^ Songs of the
Valiant Voivode	ORGANIZATION	' -LRB- not information about the author , as Mr.
Ber	PERSON	- nard erroneously says -RRB- .

		According to Mr.
Bernard	PERSON	's admission , his unsolicited letter to the reviewer was written at the request of Mr.
Slaveikoff	PERSON	, who knew that his bitterness had attracted unfavorable comment .

		Under these circumstances , the reviewer felt justified in making two quotations from this letter ; one , in justice to Mr.
Slaveikoff	PERSON	, to show that he was not the author of all the denunciation put into his essay ; and a second quotation , suggested by regret that the reviewer could not have the pious sensation experienced by the man who felt that ' he might as well review the Bible ' as the book sent forth by Mr.
Bernard	PERSON	.

		The reviewer has indeed had the privilege of exchanging several letters with
Miss Vacaresco	LOCATION	.

		When Mr.
Bernard	PERSON	conjectures that the re - viewer wrote to this lady asking her to tell him whether the songs are authentic , he is evident - ly thinking of a letter that he himself wrote to her inquiring about the authenticity of those in a former book , during the preparation of his own work .

		The reply was probably not satis - factory to the gentleman , for he confesses , ' I am far from being in
Miss Y.	LOCATION	's secrets . '

		These things are indeed ` touching in their sweet simplicity ' .

		Eulosrv from
M. Andre Bellessort	PERSON	, M. Gas - ton
Paris	LOCATION	, and the French Academy is , in Mr.
Bernard	PERSON	's opinion , exceedingly faint praise .

		It is a pity , then , that he condescends to quote from the language represented by them .

		Is it not possible that the judgment of one of the Roumanians mentioned has been preju - diced by his exile ?

		It appears that Mr.
Bernard	PERSON	has not read the offending review carefully .

		Speaking of the reference to his notice of ' Songs of the
VaKant Voivode	ORGANIZATION	' , he says , * He blames me for writing it at all . '

		Nothing of the kind was said in the review .

		In two other places he mis - quotes it , and in his excitement he exclaims , * Heavens !

		must all reviews be written with streaming eyes ? '

		Certainly not ; read that of ` The Shade of the
Balkans	LOCATION	. '

		In spite of Mr.
Bernard	PERSON	's attempted defense and the puffing of the engine , the method of putting into Mr.
Slaveikoff	PERSON	's signed essay , even * for the sake of simplicity , ' statements com - piled from others , can hardly be approved .

		As said in the review , Mr.
Bernard	PERSON	's book contains much of interest ; but the reviewer was constrained to deplore the newspaper style , the immoderate tone , the prejudice , and the undignified attack upon the Queen of Rou - mania and
Miss Vacaresco	LOCATION	; and his plea was for respectful treatment of these authors .

		He is not yet prepared to question their veracity .

		^ Simple ' need not here be construed to the good priest 's disadvantage ; rather let it be in - terpreted to mean that there is something al - most touchingly naive and joyous , unrestrained and enthusiastic , about his pleasant description of his vacation frolic in the land of the free and the home of the - brave , -- or , to quote his somewhat fervid language , ' this great and glo - rious land of liberty and faith and tolerance , tho place of all places where , in times of moral ex - haustion , men may hope to refresh their souls as they renew their physical health in the air of the mountains or the sea /

		nature , and confiding in God , death itself loses its desolation . '

		For that monstrous architec - tural jumble , the capitol at
Albany	LOCATION	, as for American architecture in general , the writer has notliing but praise .

		It must be said , how - ever , that he was disappointed in his hope of viewing the
Albany	LOCATION	wonder in person , a disap - pointment due to the route chosen from
New York	LOCATION	to
Montreal	LOCATION	, the journey being made by railway via
Springfield	LOCATION	and
Boston	LOCATION	instead of up the
Hudson	LOCATION	.

		* To miss the
Hudson	PERSON	was a mistake , perhaps , ' he admits ; * but to miss Bos - ton would have been a crime . '

		Cultured
Boston	LOCATION	is described , or partly described -- for he has considerable to say about it -- in words that unmistakably betray the writer 's nationality . '

		As
Boston	LOCATION	passes for the most intellectual city of the
United States	LOCATION	, so too it is commonly sup - posed to be the one most thoroughly permeated with French culture .

		Its era of prosperity dates back to the time when French manners and French literature set the fashion for the world .

		Fidelity to its own traditions , therefore , keeps
Boston	LOCATION	faithful to tliose of
France	LOCATION	.

		It follows our books and periodicals with close attention , and cultivates the studj ' of our language so assiduously that the French lecturer , summoned yearly to
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	by the terms of a special foundation , always finds a large and appreciative audience ready to welcome him . '

		Another regret caused by the choice of the
New England	LOCATION	route to
Montreal	LOCATION	was that of missing the
Catholic Summer School	ORGANIZATION	at I ^ ake
Champlain	LOCATION	. '

		However , ' concludes the Abbe , ' to become well acquainted with the six or seven hundred Catholics at the
Summer School	ORGANIZATION	would require at least a fortnight , and so bng a stay was simply impossible . '

		The genial visitor 's capacity for making acquaintance appears to be something extraordinary .

		Much space is , naturally enough , devoted to the Catholic church and to Catholic religious houses and schools in the
United States	LOCATION	and
Canada	LOCATION	, and the Protestant reader will learn some new things in the course of the book -- perhaps even a few things that are not so .

		But never mind ; the Abbe is not compiling a dic - tionary of statistics .

		Had he been , he probably would have thought twice before assigning so many of his co-religionists to some of our cities .

		The
Chicago Catholics	ORGANIZATION	, for example , he puts at one million , out of a total population which he makes largely in excess of census returns .

		The exemplary moralitj '' , too , that he delights to attribute to the restraining influence of the con - fessional might not be borne witness to by police court records .

		Although the phrase ` vacation frolic ' was , perhaps inadvisedly , used to characterize the author 's American tour , it must not be thought that he came among us mainly for idle amuse - ment .

		As already indicated , serious study of religious and educational systems claimed much

		THE DTATi 16S of his time .

		Here are a few sensible words prompted by a visit to the Catholic miiversity at
Notre Dame	LOCATION	,
Indiana	LOCATION	: * It requires only a brief examination of the discipline of
Notre Dame	LOCATION	to bring out an essential distinction which exists between English and American education on the one hand , and French education on the other ; it is that the former al - lows more freedom to collegians and less to ad - vanced students than we do .

		Certainly it is not the least of the inconveniences of our system that up to a boy 's eighteenth year we deprive him of ail initiative , and then of a sudden fling him into absolute independence .

		There is not one boy in our secondary schools who would not feel like an escaped prisoner if he were to enter Eton , or an American college , or the similar school in
France	LOCATION	, the
Ecole des Boches	ORGANIZATION	.

		On the other hand , there is not a young man among our advanced students who would not feel disgraced if he were asked to submit to the discipline that governs the graduates of
Oxford	LOCATION	,
Harvard	LOCATION	, or
Notre Dame	LOCATION	.

		Undoubtedly surveillance ought to be proportioned to the age of the student , but it is unwise to make all surveillance odious from the very begin - ning by irritating restraints , and then when a boy 's dangers are greatest to leave him abso - lutely to his own devices . '

		Whenever our cheerful traveller meets a dis - contented foreign-bom American , he is tempted to ask , ' Why , then , do n't you go back again to the old countr -RCB- ' ? '

		Thus a conversation about
Chicago	LOCATION	with a citizen of German birth leads to a similar silent query on the part of the French - man , whom we will leave to relate the incident in his own words , ' We are on an '' accommodation '' train ; at every stop new passengers enter , and soon all the seats are taken .

		I surrender mine to a woman , and , seeking a place on the platform , am soon deep in conversation with a
Chicago	LOCATION	tradesman .

		He is a German , native of
Cologne	LOCATION	.

		About 1880 he came to
America	LOCATION	, and has succeeded so well in business here that he has no desire to leave .

		That does not hinder him , however , from speaking very severely of the city of his adoption . ''

		Chi - cago , '' he said , '' has magnificent parks , boule - vards , and residences ; but the greater part of it is dirty to a disgusting degree .

		One would think that with the twenty
millions of dollars	MONEY	that we pay in taxes every year , the city would be able to present a clean and respectable appearance ; but three-fourths of the money goes right into the pockets of the unscrupulous politicians who are keeping a tight hold on the city government .

		But of course they have to satisfy their followers ; and how else can they be reimbursed for their heavy election expenses ?

		Democrats or
Eepubli	LOCATION	- cans , one lot is as bad as the other ; it is not worth while to turn the rascals out -- their suc - cessors would be worse .

		In this country , everyone bends the knee in worship of the Almighty Dol - lar . ''

		And in fact , this severe critic seems as devout a worshipper as the rest ; if the country is so disagreeable to him , why , except for his pecuniary interests , does n't he quit for good ?

		Besides , it is easy enough to see that a city which has increased a million inhabitants in the
last two decades	DATE	can hardly have everything in apple-pie order ; no wonder certain streets are still unswept , unmacadamized , unpaved .

		If you add to the tirade of my German friend all that I had heard of '' the city of pork - packers '' in
Europe	LOCATION	and -
Canada	LOCATION	, you will understand that I entered it without much prepossession in its favor .

		Some good people , indeed , had whispered into my ear that no one who had the faintest love of beauty or retained more than a shred of moral sense would willingly set foot on the streets of
Chicago	LOCATION	. '

		Nevertheless , praise is not wanting even for
Chicago	LOCATION	, whose ` enchanting parks ' and fine boulevards especially please the visitor .

		* What traveller , ' he asks , ' will brave all prejudice , and be the first to tell the world that there are very few cities uniting as much loveliness in their parks , their avenues , and their boulevards , as this prosaic city of
Chicago	LOCATION	?

		I would be the second to such a one ; and I would add that I have hardly seen anywhere else so many people prajing in the churches , or visiting the mu - seums and galleries , or reading in the libraries . '

		The ' handsome university to which Mr.
Rocke	PERSON	- fellers millions have piped the Pierian springs ' receives mention , but , being under Protestant auspices , it fails to attract much of the good priesf s attention .

		Prom
Chicago	LOCATION	the traveller proceeded to
Peoria	LOCATION	, of whose distinguished Bishop he has many good things to say , as wit - ness the following : * Not that
Bishop Spalding	PERSON	tries to impress one by any sort of outward show .

		American bishops are noted for their aimplieity ; and he is the simplest of them all .

		Like all truly superior minds , he respects in each the natural dignity of man , and treats everyone as his equaL I do not think he speaks in any other way to his friend President
Roosevelt	PERSON	than he would to the young - eat curate in his cathedral .

		It matters not where or before whom he may be , he is always simply himself , without precaution or reserve .

		If one inspires confidence in him , he says so , and there - after it may be relied upon .

		In the contrary case , his manner is equally candid .

		I do not faiow , -- or , rather I do know , but do not care to say , -- who it was that one day asked his cooperation in a certain enterprise , and upon being refused point-blank , demanded an explanation . ''

		Because I have no confidence in you , '' answered
Bishop Spalding	PERSON	, with the most naturail tone in the world . '

		Our strenuous President the author considers one of the two most interesting men he has ever met , Cardinal Lavigerie being the other .

		Two paragraphs from the chapter devoted chiefly to Mr.
Boosevelt	PERSON	are selected for quota - tion .

		* The man of the Strenuous Life is indeed before us .

		My seat is quite close to his .

		I miss no movement of his countenance or of his entire body , no inflection of his earnest and resonant voice .

		A magnetic current radiates from his whole being and affects everyone about him .

		I under - stand what was meant by a writer in one of the American reviews , who compared him to a dynamo , and said , '' He seems to explode his words . ''

		He is of medium height , but robust and muscular .

		His round and somewhat full face , his fine light mustache , his fresh , animated com - plexion , his hair in its original abundance , his vivacity of manner , give him , notwithstanding his 164 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, five-and-forty years , a youthful appearance which the cartoonists do ijot neglect .

		To this energetic , almost restless , make-up , a pair of blue eyes add that attribute , without which all the rest were nothing , which is called charm . ' '

		I was not , I believe , ^ playing the flatterer , in telling the President that
France	LOCATION	takes a great interest in him and his ideas .

		He then spoke of his personal sympathy with our nation .

		He mentioned the French descent of Mrs.
Roosevelt	PERSON	, -- formerly Miss
Edith Kermit Carow	PERSON	; and he added , with evidently sincere satisfaction , that he him - self had French blood in his veins .

		That was why , he continued , he had given the unusual name of Quentin to the youngest of his four boys .

		As everybody knows , he belongs to an old Dutch family that settled in
New York	LOCATION	in its early period , and has distinguished itself continuously in commerce and public affairs .

		Something less generally known , though worthy of observation for the light it throws on his many-sided character , is that several of his ancestors married daughters of French Huguenots ; that his paternal grand - mother was Irish ; and that his mother , a
Bullock	PERSON	of
Georgia	LOCATION	, was of Scotch and French descent .

		So there is a good dose of the Celt in this
New York Dutchman	LOCATION	.

		But we must remember that above all there are two centuries and a half of American education , ' The Abbe is a man of fine culture , and a wide-awake if not always sufficiently skeptical observer .

		Best of all , his whole book breathes a freshness and a joy `` of living that , quite apart from its subject-matter , are decidedly engaging ; and the amiable determination to be pleased with everything and everybody American can not but win the author many friends among the readers of his American edition .

		The already established popularity of the work in
France	LOCATION	is indicated by the fact that it passed into a 7th edition a few months after its publication , and it has received from the French Academy the Montyon prize of a thousand francs .

		The good literary style of the English version , made by the Abbe himself , and the highly entertain - ing character of the narrative , will no doubt make it a favorite in this country also .

		Illus - session is nine-tenths of the law , they certainly have the better of it .

		So , perhaps , this is the Age of Insects , and we are of secondary importance .

		Without press - ing the point -- for man 's egotism is invulner - able -- we must at least admit that the study of insects is worth while .

		As I write .


New Orleans	LOCATION	is suffering fearful penalties for her neglect to consider the mosquito and his deadly ways ; and it is more than probable that flies carried death , in the form of typhoid germs , to many of our brave boys in the Spanish war .

		It has ceased to be merely a question of loss of property ; our very lives are in danger be - cause of certain insects .

		On the other hand , from their very numbers and variety , insects afford splendid material for the investigation of many scientific problems ; while , for the same reasons , they enable even the beginner to make discoveries , -- real additions to scientific knowl - edge .

		It is not surprising , therefore , that the study of insects is becoming increasingly pop - ular , and that publishers find it worth their while to bring out large tomes upon the subject .

		Professor
Kellogg	PERSON	's book is certain to be widely useful .

		In its style , it reminds me somewhat of Figuier 's ' Insect World , ' an ad - mirable French book which was translated into English , and was one of the chief joys of my boyhood .

		Readable and profusely illustrated , it gives a great amount of information about the insects of this country , in such a manner that it is available to any intelligent person .

		Dr.
D. Sharp	PERSON	's volumes in the '
Cambridge Natural History	ORGANIZATION	' still hold the field for gen - eral entomology , and are not likely to be super - seded , unless by a larger work which their learned author has in preparation .

		Dr. How - ard 's ' Insect Book ' has a unique value for its numerous illustrations , and especially the ex - cellent life-histories .

		Other works are neces - sary for particular purposes ; but if I were asked to name a single work for a beginner , who at the same time meant business , I should not hes - itate to recommend this new product of Stan -
ford University	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is not necessary to give any detailed ac - count of the work .

		In addition to the chapters describing the different kinds of insects , there are special sections on structure and physiol - og -RCB- ' , development and transformations , insects and flowers , colors and color-patterns , insects and disease , and collecting and rearing insects .

		In a new edition , I should like to see a chap - ter on the geographical distribution of insects , if that would not make the book too large .

		The account of the beetles seems too short ; a spe - cial work on North American beetles is at pres - ent a great desideratum .

		In a work of this sort there are always some
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 165 things to criticise adversely .

		No living ento - mologist knows all groups of insects well , and it would probably be better if the several chap - ters of any general work were either written or revised by specialists .

		With all its merits , Pro- fessor
Kellogg	PERSON	's book is a little too much of a compilation to be ideally satisfactory ; and the numerous figures without specific names suggest the lack of help which might surely have been obtained for the asking .

		The nomenclature given is in some cases unsatisfactory , and in one or two instances the same insect is called by different names in different parts of the book .

		Misprints are not very uncommon , but of other errors I have found few .

		On plate ix , figure 28 is not a ` skipper ' butterfly , and its scientific name is not Archonias lyceas , but -RSB- ^ eophasia terlootii .

		Plate ii. , fig. 12 , named Meloe , appears to be Megetra vittata .

		Some of the borrowed figures are very poor , but most of the illustrations are good .

		of the '

Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean history from
1530	DATE	to
1625	DATE	.

		The twenty - two chapters are divided among sixteen authors , of whom four at least are widely and favorably known as specialists in the fields of which they write .

		These are Mr.
B. Nisbet Bain	PERSON	on Po - land , Mr.
E. Armstrong	PERSON	on
Tuscany	LOCATION	and Savoy , Mr.
Martin Hume	PERSON	in two chapters on Philip II .

Philip III	ORGANIZATION	.

		The chapters by these authors are all excellent examples of the spec - ialist 's art , and yet are well suited to the gen - eral survey that the work itself is attempting to give .

		The usual selected bibliographies ac - company the volume ; while in their preface the editors announce that upon the completion of the twelve volumes originally planned two sup - plementary volumes will appear , one containing maps of the various countries in the periods treated , and one supplying a general index to the entire work , together with some compre - hensive genealogical tables .

		distinctions made , and the emphasis placed on comparatively minor incidents , are such as the general reader can not appreciate and which therefore merely weary him .

		The work is ser - viceable for reference purposes , but is especially of value to the student of history , offering him specialist knowledge , and at the same time giv - ing him suggestions for his own work .

		An adequate review of the volume should there - fore be directed to the needs of the historical student , and should deal explicitly with each contribution ; but our present limits confine ai > - tention to but one of the many interesting chapters , that by Mr.
J. K. Laughton	PERSON	on * The Elizabethan Naval War with
Spain	LOCATION	.

		* Mr.
Laughton	PERSON	's desire for accuracy removes all the glamour of the epoch .


Hawkins	PERSON	,
Drake	PERSON	, and even Sir
Humphrey Gilbert	PERSON	, are depicted as little better than freebooters , ahnost pirates in fact , and as probably animated much more with the love of adventure and of easily gotten pillage than with religious or national enthu - siasm .

		It is not a pleasant picture of an age that the Protestant historians have taught us to look upon as one of inspiring religious patriotism .

		Moreover , while the author is care - ful to state that
England	LOCATION	wholly underesti - mated her own naval strength in the contest with
Spain	LOCATION	, he proves in fact that the Great Spanish Armada was but an empty bubble that burst upon the first contact with the efficient fleet of
England	LOCATION	.

		The English ships .

		were quick , active , fast sailers , supplied with heavier guns of longer range than were the Spanish , and were manned with sailors who also fought the `` iiip ; while the Armada consisted of poorly equipped and poorly victualed floating forts , in which the sailors had no share in the fighting , and which were crowded with troops and com - manded by soldiers .

		These vessels were expected to come to hand-to-hand conflicts with the enemy , when the valor of the Spanish troops was counted upon to win the victory ; but , clumsy in movement and hadly sailed , the sol - diers in them never had a fair chance to prove their reputed valor .

		The English simply kept their distance and maintained a steady pound - ing of the enemy .

		Storms and bad weather , according to Mr.
Laughton	PERSON	, had little to do with the English victory , for an entire week of good weather intervened between the opening of the conflict and the beginning of tempests .

		Of the Spanish ships , many of the hundred and thirty belonging to the Armada were mere transports , or supply ships , with no fighting qualities whatever ; so that in the final analysis the real ` men of war ' numbered about fifty on each side .

		The entire victory was simply the victory of newer and better ships , heavier guns , and newer methods , over an antiquated 166 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, pattern of vessel and an obsolete style of naval warfare .

		It was in truth a mere slaughter , as is shown by the fact that the English lost but some sixty men all told in killed and wounded , though many sailors died soon after from a disease that broke out in the fleet ; while the Armada lost sixty-three ships and thousands of men .

		Tliese figures prove , better than any words , the inequality of the contest .

		This analysis of Philip II .

		's famous attempt to invade
England	LOCATION	is unquestionably in perfect harmony with the best results of modem his - torical research , and is therefore to be wel - comed on the ground of historical accuracy ; but the danger in such studies is that the writ - ers forget contemporary opinion , which is after all the chief interest in historical study , and , by dwelling on the errors into which contem - poraries fell , underestimate or even lose sight of the importance and influence of the very misapprehension of the facts .

		The importance of the defeat of the Armada , viewing it from its effect on the English nation , lies largely in the fact that the people believed that
England	LOCATION	had won a victory against overwhelming odds .

		This is in some measure indicated by Mr.
Laughton	PERSON	, but not with sufficient emphasis .

		His delight in proving the actual superiority of the English fleet blinds him in a degree to the devout thankfulness of the nation at a God - sent preservation .

		In treating of the years after the Armada of 158S , the author is not so critical ; for he re - gards that year as practically marking the con - clusion of the struggle between
England	LOCATION	and
Spain	LOCATION	for the supremacy at sea .

		In fact , how - ever , two authors , Mr.
Julian Corbett	PERSON	in * The Successors of
Drake	PERSON	' and Mr.
Martin Hume	PERSON	in ` Treason and Plot , ' have both conclusively demonstrated that the last ten years of
Eliza	LOCATION	- beth 's reign were years of increased Spanish effort for the overthrow of
England	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Cor	PERSON	- bett ranks the Armada of
1599	DATE	as a more tre - mendous effort on the part of
Spain	LOCATION	, and as more dangerous to
England	LOCATION	, than that of
1588	DATE	; while Mr.
Hume	PERSON	, both in the book just named and even in his two chapters in the present volume , shows the wave of patriotism and the desire for revenge that swept over
Spain	LOCATION	when the news of the defeat of
1588	DATE	was received .

		Possibly the period assigned to Mr.
Laughton	PERSON	extended beyond that in which he had a special knowledge , and he was thus led to conclude his article with the old accepted tradition , not being aware that the tradition had recently been undermined .

		This is not a criticism of the specialist , for the specialist 's knowledge must stop somewhere ; it is rather an inevitable fault of a general history written by a number of specialists .

		Stories and Traditions of tite Pawnee Indians .

		* Dr.
George A. Dorsey	PERSON	is an indefatigable worker in the field of American folk-lore .

		Dur - ing the past few years he has paid particular attention to that extremely interesting group of Plains Indians known as the Caddoan stock .

		His studies in regard to the religion and mythologies of the tribe forming this stock are of exceptional interest .

		The Caddoan family includes the
Arikara	LOCATION	,
Caddo	ORGANIZATION	,
Kichai	PERSON	,
Pawnee	LOCATION	, and
Wichita	LOCATION	.

		The legends of the
Arikara	LOCATION	and the
Wichita	LOCATION	have been published by Dr.
Dorsey	PERSON	under other auspices ; the stories gathered among the Skidi Pawnee are presented in the volume before us .

		The
Arikara	LOCATION	and the Pawnee are closely related .

		The Pawnee themselves are divided into three subdivis - ions , -- the
Ghaui	PERSON	,
Pitahauirat	LOCATION	,
Kitkehahki	PERSON	, and Skidi Pawnee .

		It is probable that the Skidi are in reality more closely related to the
Arikara	LOCATION	than they are to the other groups of so-called Pawnee .

		The Pawnee , as long as they have been known , have been tribes of the great Plains .

		Their ancestral home in j ^ ebraska was a brok - en , dry , sandy district , with a scant growth of timber along the water-courses .

		It was a fa - mous hunting-ground , abounding in buffalo , deer , antelope , otter , beaver , mink wolves , coy - otes , and foxes , and in the mountains westward bears and mountain lions .

		The nature of the country in which they formerly lived has in - fluenced , as is natural , the form of the stories themselves .

		In an introduction of some twenty pages , Dr.
Dorsey	PERSON	gives the more important facts re - garding the life and customs of the Pawnee .

		Chief in interest , among these , are their social organization and their religion .

		In their social organization , the Skidi show no trace of the clan , or gens , so commonly the social unit among
American Indians	ORGANIZATION	.

		The village is the element .

		Of these , there were nineteen , each with its sacred bundle .

		Marriage within the village was endogamous ; each village had a hereditary head-chief , and the people of the vil - lage were considered descendants of the orig - inal owner of the sacred bundle preserved in it .

		Below the chief were four braves , police under his direction ; below the braves ranked four priests , after whom in consequence were the medicine-men and the warriors .

		Last of all were the common people .

1906	DATE	.

		J THE DIAL , 167 the Tillage system , the Pawnee were quite pe - culiar among American tribes .

		In their religious thought and practice they were quite as interesting .

		They recognized a supreme being ,
Tirawa	LOCATION	, whose commands were executed by lesser gods ; next to him and his wife -- the vault of heaven -- was the evening star .

		She was the mother of the first terres - trial beings , their father being the morning star ; her four attendants -- wind , cloud , light - ning , and thunder -- transmitted
Tirawa	PERSON	's mandates to the people .

		Her garden of grow - ing grain and her herds of buffalo were the pro- totypes from which terrestrial fields and herds drew life .

		Her husband , the morning star , ranked next to her .

		To their child , a girl , the Skidi formerly offered a maiden as a sacrifice .

		After these divine beings came the gods of the world quarters , creators of all but the first pair ; then a crowd of other meteorological and stellar deities , each with his place and func - tion ; then followed the divine animals and the messengers .

		The Skidi had a remarkably de - eloped star-cult , influencing the arrangement and location of their villages when they came together to celebrate the great ceremonials .

		These were then so placed as to reproduce ter - restrially those distributions which the gods had made in the celestial vault .

		The mysterious bundles used in the village ceremonials were de - rived from the god of the village .

		These bun - dles vary , though their general similarity is evident .

		Each contains at least one pipe , to - bacco , paints , certain birds , and the mother corn .

		These objects were wrapped in a piece of buffalo-skin , and the bimdle thus formed was treated with respect and was in charge of a regularly recognized owner .

		At the ceremon - ial of each bundle , a ritual was sung and an offering was made to it .

		To the morning-star bundle a human maiden was sacrificed : to the evening-star bundle , tobacco , and the heart and tongue of a buffalo .

		Each bundle had its ap - propriate dance , performed in the ceremonial , and its particular origin story , which was nar - rated between the ritual song and the dance .

		It may be mentioned , in passing , that Dr.
Dor	PERSON	- sey , with a great amount of trouble , has suc - ceded in securing a considerable number of these sacred bundles for the
Field Columbian Museum	ORGANIZATION	, with which he is connected .

		The stories of the collection before us num - ber ninety-one .

		Among the most interesting of them are the origin stories of the bundles .

		There are , however , various other types , and Dr.
Dorsey	PERSON	groups the whole collection under six heads : 1 ,
Cosmogonic	LOCATION	, including the origin stories of the bundles ; 2 , boy heroes ; 3 , medi - cine ; 4 , animal tales ; 5 , people marrying ani - mals , or becoming animals ; and 6 , miscellan - eous .

		On the whole , the character of the stor - ies , from the point of view of thought and ex - pression , is high ; and they compare favorably with those of other Indian tribes .

		It would he interesting to present some of the more strik - ing features and elements of the tales , but the limits of our review prevent so doing .

		Many of them would be encountered in the stories of other tribes ; while others are quite character - istic and local .

		The stories as a whole give an excellent idea of the life and thought of a Plains tribe .

		Two problems seem just now to fa ^ e the eth - nologist who collects and publishes the stories of barbaric peoples .

		The first is in regard to the form in which to cast the legend .

		It is clear that the simplicity of the original should be retained ; but its sense and true merit ought not to be sacrificed in so doing .

		There is a tendency at present to give aboriginal stories in a broken dialectic form which is difficult of comprehension , and which mars and destroys whatever beauty the stories themselves may possess .

		Thus , in the dialect version of the legends of the Torres Straits islanders given by
Haddon	LOCATION	, we receive an impression of im - becilitv in the narrators ; it is unfair to the native story-teller to weight him down with the imperfections of the badly - learned foreign language which serves as the vehicle of his narration .

		What is wanted is the meaning put with all the simple direct - ness and naturalness which the story-teller would give it if he were speaking in his native tongue .

		Dr.
Dorsey	PERSON	has avoided this fault of dialect rendition ; for fault it is , and not ` scientific accuracy . '

		These Pawnee stories are told in good English , and adequately present what the teller meant to say .

		The second prob - lem is the dealing with indecent and obscene passages .

		In these Skidi tales .

		Dr.
Dorsey	PERSON	throws such passages into Latin .

		It is difficult to see his rule of judgment , as many passages which are not Latinized are quite as objection - able as the worst of those which are .

		The pres - ent reviewer does not find in the Skidi collec - tion any matter which really needs to be thus treated .

		When there is really objectionable matter in aboriginal tales , one of two things may be done : if the passage is essential to the story , the whole story may be omitted ; if the passage is not essential , it may itself be drop - ped , the remainder of the story being presented .

		The argument that it is necessary to give ev - erything , in order to present aboriginal thought and life , is false ; there is no population but what has its stories that are best left unre - peated .

		The purpose of collecting ethnic tales is that we may compare their thought and expression with our own , and with those of 168 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, people related to us , yet the collections of pop - ular stories told among English and Dutch , French and German , contain no objectionable passages ; and this is not because the Aryan mind is pure and produces naught that is foul .

		To compare an unexpurgated collection of In - dian stories with Aryan collections which have been carefully culled is highly unjust to the aboriginal story-teller .

		At the close of the stories , Dr.
Dorsey	PERSON	pre - sents notes and explanations of points which otherwise might not be understood , and makes a few comparisons with similar stories from other peoples .

		One must regret that this work of an - notation was not more fully carried out .

		We have , however , said enough to indicate the high importance and interest of the work .

		* In the last analysis , the work is the inter - preter of the man .

		It may be , as in the case of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, that the work is so tremendous that a final interpretation is next to impossible , and the man is hidden in the intense objectiv - ity of his creations ; but such cases , after all , are rare .

		The man is bound to disclose his per - sonality in style and substance .

		Usually , how - ever , he does not make himself the direct sub - ject of his work ; he is content to let himself shine through it .

		Pepys chose to treat himself as his own confessor , and an unsuspecting editor gave the confession to the world .

		The result is that we know
Samuel Pepys	PERSON	better than any other man in English literature ; we know his failings , all the little pettinesses that an ordin - ary man hates , to confess even to himself , as well as all that makes him one of the best fel - lows in history .

		But
Pepys	PERSON	had no idea that he was contributing anything to either litera - ture or literary history ; in this respect , at least , he was of all men most innocent .

		tive of the human race , and therefore a sub - ject of perennial interest .

		And of the men who have presumed on their own excellence as lit - erary material , few have done so with greater justice or with greater self - content .

		Diverse and undulant Montaigne says he is ; and few will contradict him .

		He was bom of an upper middle-class family , yet was taught by his father to associate with the peasantry as well as with his equals ; the Eenaissance was in its full glory , and he was the inheritor at once of the new paganism and of the old mediaeval Christianity , with the result that he was three - quarters pagan and one-quarter Christian .

		He had no one settled philosophic or religious be - lief ; the one science worth knowing thorough - ly , he felt , is that of living well and dying well , -- * loyally to enjoy our being , ' as he says .

		He roamed through literature , taking what he liked and neglecting whatever he found diffi - cult or not exactly to his taste .

		* If I speak variously of myself , ' he says , * it is because I consider myself variously ; all contrarieties are found in me , at this turn or that , in this way or another ; bashful , insolent ; chaste , luxur - ious ; prating , taciturn ; laborious , delicate ; in - genious , dull ; fretful , debonaire ; lying , truth - ful ; knowing , ignorant ; and liberal , and avar - icious , and prodigal . '

		Professor
Dowden	PERSON	, in undertaking a life of Montaigne , not only had the inherent difficulty of his tantalizingly varied subject , which placed him in competition with the Essays themselves , but had also the handicap of inevitable compar - ison with a series of biographies of established reputation .

		His work is the initial volume of the * French Men of Letters ' series , which is , of course , modelled on Mr.
Morle/s	PERSON	` English Men of Letters ' series .

		It is as high praise , perhaps , as one can give , to say that the new series starts out as well and promises as much as the old .

		The general plan of the older ser - ies is followed in the matter of treatment and length .

		In its 360 pages , this work seeks to interpret the author not merely by the facts of his life but also by what he reveals of himself in his writings .

		And , as was said above , Mon - taigne lays himself bare for the inspection of the reader .

		The danger for the biographer was lest he should lose himself in the multi - plicity of this self-revealing detail .

		He avoided this danger by distributing what
Montaigne	ORGANIZATION	says over the full period of his life .

		Thus , we see the essayist 's noint of view toward his early training , which differed in so many respects from that of his contemporaries as well as from that of today ; toward his remarkable friendship with La Boetie , which stands out as a great romance in an otherwise calm life , his intellectual and religious kinship with the

Bordeaux	LOCATION	.

		It is no cut-and-dried bi - ography , but an illuminated record of the mind and soul of the man whom Sainte-Beuve called * the wisest Frenchman that ever lived / * Miss
Norton	PERSON	's books are different ; they are rather a collection of essays of a critical char - acter , somewhat after the fashion of a doctorial dissertation .

		They seek to show the relation of the Essays to the earlier Sebonde transla - tion , the editorial work in connection with the posthumous publication of La Boetie ^ s writ - ings , and the like ; they put forth the theory that certain of the essays , such as that on Van - .

		ity , are combinations of earlier unpublished es - says .

		The theory is a risky one for the various and undulant Montaigne , and one suspects that too much may be proved from the mere form of the Essays .

		The chief fault with Miss Nor - ton 's books , however , is their unfailing dryness .

		Never for a moment does she arouse a healthy interest in her readers .

		Let one compare her chapter on the friendship of Montaigne and La Boetie with
Dowden	PERSON	's , and he will see the difference between what mars and what makes a book .

		A hiatory of Public discussion of various re ^ the American form movements connected with civil service .

		^ hg
United States Civil Service	ORGANIZATION	during the past thirty-five years has resulted in valuable contributions to the literature of the subject .

		A trustworthy history of the inception of these movements , as well as the evils which they are supposed to cure , was needed , and has been furnished by Professor
Carl Russel Fish	PERSON	, of the
University of `` Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	, in a monograph of the
Harvard Historical Studies	ORGANIZATION	under the title `
The Civil Service	ORGANIZATION	and the Patronage ' -LRB- Long - mans ,
Green & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Mr.
Fish	PERSON	examines the policy of each President , from ``
Washington	LOCATION	to
McKin	PERSON	- ley , toward the public patronage and tenure of office .

		He finds that ``
Washington	LOCATION	pursued the plan of making appointments solely for meritori - ous qualifications , and removals only for the effi - ciency of the service .

		On this ground the first President removed seventeen officials during the eight years of his administration .

		The merit system held moderately well until the coming of President
Jackson	PERSON	.

		Exact figures of removals in his administration are wanting .

		Professor Fish • There should be added to the Bibliography Mr.
J. Churton Collins	PERSON	' 8 ' Studies in
Shakespeare	LOCATION	, ' for the sake of its article on the relation of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	to Montaigne ; and Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	's monograph in the ' Encyclopaedia Britannica . '

		sees in the inauguration of the spoils system the satisfaction of a large demand for ` reform ' in administration , one species of reform being the casting out of professional office-holders .

		Another wave of reform marked the Whig inauguration of
Harrison	PERSON	and Tyler in
1841	DATE	, terminating the tenure of 304 Democratic officials .

		President
Pierce	PERSON	caused 883 changes in office .

		All Presi - dents were not so fortunate as to follow a change in political parties ; hence the plan was instituted of considering all appointments as made for four years only .

		The slight attempts to cast off the spoils system before
1876	DATE	were nullified by the Reconstruction era , the very nature of which aroused the strongest feelings of partisanship .

		Here the author keeps conscientiously within the pale of his subject , resisting the temptation to describe the scandals of
Grant	ORGANIZATION	's second term , due largely to an abuse of the patronage .

		The diffi - culties under which reform movements in the
Civil Service	ORGANIZATION	have made headway are well brought out by Mr.
Fish	PERSON	.

		He attributes the suc - cess of these efforts , against the hostility of political machines and partisan leaders , to ` the non-partisan character of the movement at the same time that it has not been unpartisan .

		* Con - sequently it has received no serious check through the mutations of party fortunes .

		Other elements of strength , according to the author , may be found in the candor and publicity with which the movements have been conducted , and in the growth of pubHe sentiment as to the necessity for reform .

		Our modem extension of industry has also brought a demand for the application of business principles to government service .

		The volume is a valuable addition to the other num - bers in a valuable series , representing scholarly contributions to knowledge within the field of American history and administration .

		wuh pen and Thc true lover of books written pencil , through by great men is apt to look
Dickens	PERSON	's country , askance at books written about them .

		The bushel of chaff they contain is fre - quently too dusty to repay him for the search for the few grains of wheat they may hold , and the reviewer too often lapses into a habit of relegating such volumes to the shelf from which he gives gifts to the indiseriminating acquaint - ance to whom a book is a book .

		In ` The
Dick	PERSON	- ens Country , ' however , the case is quite other - wise ; and it is a real regret that the patient and devoted author can never know how great must be the appreciation of all lovers of the writings of
Charles Dickens	PERSON	for the service he has rendered , nor how sincere must be the enjoyment of those who follow him on his chosen pathway .

		`` With an enthusiasm tempered by sound judgment , and guided by an exhaustive knowledge of every page
Dickens	PERSON	wrote , Mr.
Kit	PERSON	- ton made his way over every foot of that part of
England	LOCATION	` having
London	LOCATION	as its centre and
Roch	ORGANIZATION	- ester as its literary capital , ' which has been ` treasured up to a life beyond life ' by his mas - ter 's pen .

Time	ORGANIZATION	makes among the haunts of men , and so resistlessly does the commercial spirit wage war against every - thing that stands in its way .

		In the very inter - esting photographic reproductions with which the book is filled we can read at a glance the fortunes of the man whose career began in a little house at
Portsea	LOCATION	, and ended nearly sixty years later in the charming house at Gad 's Hill .

		As we follow the pictures , and the delightful text by which they are illustrated , we wonder sometimes where
Dickens	PERSON	ever found time to do anything else than pack and unpack his belongings , or why he had ever any serious thought of any other profession than that of a bagman , so incredible is it that one man could have lived in so many houses or stop - ped at so many inns .

		The world had been a poorer place , however , had either choice or cir - cumstance made his life other than it was ; for from each halting-place , however brief the stay , the busy brain carried an impression , and from the vast fund of detail thus accumulated there was never a lack of material for the proper setting for any character or any effect it might wish to pro- duce .

		It had been impossible that even one of
Dickens	PERSON	's novels had been written , but for that restlessness , -- inborn , perhaps inbred , by the peculiar conditions of his life ; and it had surely been out of the question to have given us the
England of Dickens	ORGANIZATION	's novels -- but for the Eng - land of
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	's life .

		Not the least interesting part of the book is the short introduction , in which Mr.
Arthur Waugh	PERSON	tells us something of the life and character of the gentle and kindly man , since dead , who prepared this charming book .

The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Biography of ` The Wealth of
Nations	ORGANIZATION	, ' says ` ile ^ ` Team ^ Mr.
Francis W. Hirst	PERSON	, ` is a book of
Nations	ORGANIZATION	. '

		to be read as it was written .

		More than half its nutriment and all its fascina - tion is lost if you cut away the theory from its historical setting . '

		Such , it would seem , is the central thought about which Mr.
Hirst	PERSON	has writ - ten his biography of
Adam Smith	PERSON	for the ` Eng - lish Men of Letters ' series -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The old extenuation of any tendency toward narrowness in ` The Wealth of
Nations	ORGANIZATION	, ' i. e , , ` insular con - ditions , ' which we had swallowed whole , so to speak , seems superficial indeed when with Mr.
Hirst	PERSON	we follow
Adam Smith	PERSON	's early career , his connection with the
University of Glasgow	ORGANIZATION	, hia travels in
France	LOCATION	, his timely observation of dis - turbed affairs at home and his very unusual op - portunities to sift matters in argument with his keen-witted circle of friends .

		As Mr.
Hirst	PERSON	car - ries us gradually along through these various phases of
Adam Smith	PERSON	's life , he insistently shows how each in turn left its mark , and how ' The Wealth of Nations ' was the logical result .

		It is
Adam Smith	PERSON	's pre-vision alone that is relegated to the regions of the inexplicable .

		The task the author set for himself he has accomplished with thoroughness and even with interest ; for there is about this biography no suggestion of dullness .

		Especially dextrous is his defense of
Adam Smith	PERSON	's relations with the French school and of his attitude toward Free Trade .

		His friendship with
Hume	PERSON	, devoted , though oftentimes assum - ing a controversial attitude , seems to have been his greatest mental stimulus , although he was also deeply influenced by his contact with such men as
Burke	PERSON	,
Franklin	PERSON	, and
Pulteney	ORGANIZATION	.

		But it is by no means to be inferred that Mr.
Hirst	PERSON	, in emphasizing the importance of ` The
Wealth of Nations	ORGANIZATION	, ' has neglected
Smith	ORGANIZATION	's earlier writings , for ` The Theory of Moral Sentiments ' is ably discussed and contrasted with the author 's later work .

		And , further , Mr.
Hirst	PERSON	has given us a fund of incident and anecdote of
Adam Smith	PERSON	and his times which will be diverting even to those readers who profess no interest in ` the dismal science ' of political economy .

Adler	PERSON	's pulpit in
Carnegie Hall	LOCATION	.

		His books on ` Life and Destiny ' and on ` Marriage and Divorce ' aroused a deep and sincere interest at the time of their publica - tion .

		But Dr.
Adler	PERSON	is too busy doing active work to be able to spend much time preparing his lectures for publication .

		Feeling that ` to put into the hands of earnest people the words of one who has been a leader to many would be to extend an influence which may contribute to the prog - ress of the higher life , ' Mr.
Leslie Willis Sprague	PERSON	has undertaken the pleasant task of arranging and editing some Qf Dr.
Adler	PERSON	's most characteris - tic and vital lectures , and these are now published under the title ` The Religion of Duty ' by Mc -
Clure , Phillips & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Duty is the watchword of the
Ethical Society	ORGANIZATION	, although it can not be called a part of its creed , since Dr.
Adler	PERSON	distinctively emphasizes the fact that the Society has no creed , -- that in this ` Church of the unchurched ' no man 's religion , not even that of the founder and leader , is or need be subscribed to by all the mem - bers .

		The point of union is not a common re - ligion , or even a common philosophy , but the ` fundamental conception that progress in right living is the paramount aim of life ; that right thinking and right believing are important only as they lead to right living , and that the think - ing and believing must approve themselves to be right by their fruits in conduct . '

		Dr.
Adler	PERSON	's religious lectures gain rather than lose in interest through the fact that they are the expression of his personal opinion .

		Especially interesting are the first lectures , on `
First Steps Toward	ORGANIZATION	a Religion , ' ` Changes in the Conception of Gk -RRB- d , ' and ` Teaching of Jesus in the Modem World . '

		The arrival of the Pilgrims , the modelling of the coast where they landed , the making of their tools , the building of their houses , each contains an idea `` whi - ' h can be made to render effective service in helpmg children to understand the situation through their own ex - periences .

		The training of the intellect through the senses , through the hand , the eye , the ear , which forms the basis of modern industrial edu - cation , is the general theme of Miss
Dopp	PERSON	's book .

		She holds the theory , well substantiated , that the child grows along the lines in which the race has grown ; his earliest instincts are the instincts of early man , and it should be the object of the in - telligent educator to satisfy these instincts in work and play and to be ready for the natural advance to the next stage of growth .

		How this is being done in various schools of the country is shown in illustrations of children at work .

		These illustrations are another new feature of this edi - tion of Miss

		This ideal existence , accord - ing to Mr.
Lathbury	PERSON	, consists in an adjustment of ourselves so perfect that we are ` not conscious of distinct faculties , but only of a happy and whole life . '

		With this end in view , he bids us culti - vate the health of both body and spirit ; for through their concerted action we are to find life in its best sense .

		Undreamed of possibilities of happiness , he says , lie latent in each one of us ; but an almost universal lack of the physical and mental balance stands as a proof that we are not yet arrived at perfection but only on the road to it .

		The vocabularies include many new and technical words not heretofore included in lexicons of this sort , the definitions are concise and intelligible , etymology is freely indicated , synonyms are fully given , capital initials are used in words that invariably require the capital , degrees of adjectives and plurals of irregular nouns are stated .

		NOTES 212 TOPICS IN LEADING PERIODICAI # ... 213 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 214 THE CASE OF THE DRAMA .

		Now that the playhouses are fairly started upon a new season of enterprise , and we begin to get some notion , from managers and press agents , of the sort of dramatic fare the coming year is likely to provide for our nutriment , a few random comments upon the case of the drama may not be impertinent .

		That the case is a bad one , speaking , of course , for our own country , and for
England	LOCATION	incidentally , it takes no expert diagnosis to discover .

		The ailment is chronic , and the conditions thus far are sub - stantially those of last year , and of many years preceding .

		The theatrical menus vary in ap - pearance , but their offerings are of the same pastry and syllabub which spell indigestion and worse .

		`` We have in prospect the same suc - cession of trick dramas , and tailor-made dramas , of dramas made to fit the mannerisms of par - ticular actors , of dramas -- Heaven save the mark !

		-- whose most noteworthy feature is that they are without any possible pretension to be reckoned as products of dramatic art .

		Plus ^ a change , pins c'est meme chose , but we supinely accept what our lords of the syn - dicate deign to give us , and utter no word of effective protest .

		Of the
summer	DATE	season that is past , and of
summer	DATE	seasons in general , we are not minded to make much account .

		The
summer	DATE	months are proverbially abandoned to silliness , and the stage does no more than enter into the spirit of the hour .

		It may be admitted that the sum - mer playhouse easily leads all its allied agencies of entertainment or distraction in competing for the palm bestowed upon inanity , and that some of the theatrical concoctions of recent years have attained a depth of imbecile vul - garity that one would have held impossible without the ocular and auditory proof .

		But leaving the silly season to its own peculiar pravity in things dramatic , we may at least be permitted to voice the concern with which all seriously-minded people view the abandonment of wellnigh our whole theatrical year to the shows of frivolity , the widespread prosti - tution of the drama to uses that , if not abso - lutely base , are unworthy of the traditions and the possibilities of that noble art .

		What with the gieed and vanity of performers , and the sordid commercialism of managers , considera - tions of art have small chance to prevail , and 196 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, still less considerations of ethical and educa - tional responsibility .

		For the situation , as we so often have said before , is simply this : In every considerable country of continental
Europe	LOCATION	, the drama of to-day has its rightful place in literature by the side of the novel and the poem .

		It is a vital mode of expression , and enlists in its service the most penetrating intellect and the highest creative activity .

		It takes for its province all the manifestations of the spirit , and shrinks from the envisagement of no serious human relation .

		It moves with the stream of contem - poraneous tendency , and contributes a large element to the total volume of literary energy .

		It constantly produces work that is not only seen upon the stage , but is also published and widely read as a form of literature .

		In Eng - land and
America	LOCATION	, on the other hand , the drama has lost its vitality , and become little more than a low form of stagecraft .

		It has repelled the advances of those who might be makers of genuine dramatic literature , and driven them into the field of the closet drama .

		It has narrowed its outlook to the superficial - ities of life , rejecting the essence and keeping in view the trappings alone .

		Its products are rarely found worth publishing in books , for they will not bear the scrutiny of reflective minds .

		For the future historian of our present - day literature , the acting drama will be liter - ally non-existent , since it will not be discover - able in printed form , and those who have known it by actual contact will not have found it worth remembering .

		To put the case con - cretely , the coming chronicler and critic of the dramatic annals of the later nineteenth century will find abundant material for philosophical comment and analysis in the writings of such Europeans as Messrs.
Ibsen	PERSON	,
Bjornson	PERSON	,
Haupt	PERSON	- mann ,
Sudermann	LOCATION	, d'Annunzio ,
Echegaray	PERSON	,
Augier	PERSON	,
Dumas	PERSON	, and
Maeterlinck	PERSON	; but when he turns to
England	LOCATION	, he will find no metal more attractive than the plays of Messrs.
Phil	PERSON	- lips and
Pinero	PERSON	and Jones , and
America	LOCATION	will -LRB- rather shamefacedly , we should imagine -RRB- point to Messrs.
Augustus Thomas	PERSON	and
Clyde Fitch	PERSON	, and say , ' These are my jewels . '

		We have grown so accustomed to this un - fortunate condition of affairs that few of us realize its appalling significance .

		The present regime seems to work smoothly enough ; the managers get the money , the actors get the applause , and the public gets the entertain - ment .

		All these parties to the system play into each other 's hands , while the critics , for the most part , accept the situation complacently , making the best of a bad business , now and then feebly protesting against some conspicu - ous offense , but on the whole letting well enough alone , and weakly abdicating their prop - er function .

		Meanwhile the public , which is the least culpable of the parties concerned -- although severely enough censurable for its easy-going acceptance of things as they are -- suffers at the worst a .

		degradation of all its standards of taste and morals , at the best a sort of slow spiritual starvation .

		We have thus sought to set forth existing conditions without much notion of suggesting a remedy .

		No remedy can be expected to oper - ate otherwise than by slow degrees , and by in - fluences gradually radiating from nuclei of earnest and self-sacrificing endeavor .

		Such a nucleus might be provided by a subsidized enterprise , under intelligent direction , under - taken either by public effort or private initiative .

		Such a nucleus already exists wherever a company of actors is found in any - thing like a permanent organization , working for a common interest and sharing a common pride .

		Such a nucleus would be found in any writer of genius , mastering the technique of dramatic composition , fixed in his determina - tion to make no concessions to a meretricious taste , and endowed with a fair measure of prac - tical good sense .

		The signs are not wholly lacking of the appearance of such nuclei , and of the crystallization of strengthening elements about them .

		And wherever they come into view , wherever something worth doing is seriously attempted , there is usually a gratifying response in the way of sub - stantial support .

		This is the encouraging feature of the seemingly hopeless case of our drama ; this is the promising fact that nega - tives the time-worn managerial plea that the public is given what it demands .

		We believe that our commercialized showmen underesti - mate the public intelligence and capacity , and that this is the capital cause of a condition in things theatrical that we can not too early or too insistently attempt to reform .

		THE PROBLEMS OF TRANSLATION .

		The prevailing interest in historical study and research , and the great extent of the field in which historical students are at work , emphasize both the need of good translations of matter in foreign languages and the melancholy lack of them .

		Few historical students or editors or writers have the leisure or linguistic ability to make all their own translations , -- especially when , as often happens , the matter they wishi to use is in three or four different languages , or when a book or document is located in some dis - tant library ; and thus they are forced to depend more or less upon the aid of others .

		There are plenty of would-be translators and alleged trans -
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		197 lation ?!

		.

		but most of them seem to be Iticus a non lucendo ; and he who depends on them is too often disappointed , injured , and -LRB- in this case righteously -RRB- exasperated .

		It would seem that he might reasonably expect a good English translation of a document in a language that he does not know , from a successful instructor or a ' star ' student in the language department of a , university , or from an official translator in a government bureau , or from a talented and educated person who has resided abroad for years and is considered a master of one or more foreign languages ; but any one of these may be s. dismal failure when thorough and accurate translation is required .

		The causes of this deficiency would form a curious and interesting study ; they are , of course , partly matters of experience and prac - tice , but among them appear certain psycho - logical factors , some of which are of the unex - pected sort .

		The practical difficulties of the historical translator are , it is true , very great ; and no one can better appreciate these than does a competent translator , or the experienced stu - dent or writer who must have an accurate ren - < lering of a document .

		The earlier its date , the more will linguistic forms vary ; and archaic , obsolete , provincial , and foreign words are apt to spring up like weeds along the translators path .

		He finds astonishing variations of proper names , especially those of places and of aborigi - nal tribes , which , usually recorded in more or less phonetic form by writers unfamiliar witli the language to which these belong , and often received at second or third hand from natives of other tribes , or from illiterate traders or soldiers , require for their identification both a natural perception of phonetic values and a well-trained ear .

		He encounters , too , mam ' words denoting foreign plants , animals , weights and measures , moneys , weapons , industries , customs , peculiar institutions , official titles , and what not , that are new and strange to him , and often can not be found in the usual standard lexicons , but on which he must obtain some information in order to make his English version intelligible .

		Often he can not understand a geographical description without tracing a route or exploring an archi - pelago on the map .

		Some valuable writings were made by unlettered men , who had but slight knowledge of the mysteries of grammar and rhetoric , and whose spelling was French or Ger - man ' as she is wrote ' ; and it often requires much care and patience to ascertain just whaf they meant to say .

		Documents of this sort have a singular and fascinating attraction for one who can appreciate their human interest , and can see the picturesque and dramatic aspects of history ; but educated and scholarly persons often turn with impatience and annoyance from the diary of a French voyageur , or the relation of a Spanish soldier , who , though he may be a keen obsener of savage character or customs , has often but very meagre knowledge of punc - tuation , spelling , and the proper sequence of tenses .

		Many questions arise which concern matters of fact , of historical or scientific accur - acy , rather than of grammar or idiom ; and here guesses will not do , although they are made often enough to justify the sajdng , ' Fools rush in where angels fear to tread . '

		Xor will merely literarj * or linsruistic ability avail to make a good translation of matter which is more than a simple description or narrative .

		Matters political , commercial , ecclesiastical , or ethno - logical , complicate the task , and require for their elucidation an ' all-round ' training -- worldly experience , a knowledge of affairs , and acquaintance with human nature .

		These same qualifications are needed for another and highly important part of the translator 's work , the ability to supply what is lacking in the authors words , and even sometimes in his thought -- a need which often arises in documents that were ^ v ^ itten at certain periods , or by persons of peculiar temperament , or those of deficient education .

		To pick up the dropped threads in such cases , and weave them into the pattern aright , is a delicate task , and is too often bungled or entirely neglected .

		The majority of translators display painfull -RRB- * inadequate qualifications and equipment for this work .

		Too many persons have the mistaken idea that a respectable grammatical and linguistic knowledge of a foreign tongue is sufficient for its translation ; but this is only the beginning .

		Evoi more necessary is a thorough knowledge of the English language -- command of its re - sources , a large vocabulary , familiarity with it ; ?

		fine shades of meaning , good taste in the selec - tion of words , directness and simplicity of con - struction , and clear and concise expression .

		Many translators seem quite unable to grasp a sentence or paragraph as a whole , or to perceive the relations between several of these .

		Often it is impossible to obtain the real meaning of a phrase or sentence except when it is seen in the light of its context ; and a single idea or statement may dominate or color a long account or exposition .

		Idiomatic expressions form a most difficult feature of translation ; and yet ifc ; quality and force depend greatly on the way in which these are handled .

		Often the authors thought needs some expansion in order to make it clear in English ; but the translator must be - ware of reading into the text his own ideas , and too free rendering is a stone over which many stumble , -- as also is the opposite fault , that of following with wooden literalness the words and syntactical peculiarities of the text .

		The trans - 198 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, lator may here have to walk ' between the devil and the deep sea ' ; but the path is straight , even if it be narrow .

		Few translators seem to appre - ciate the importance of preserving , when possi - ble , the rhetorical figures of the original ; these add tone and piquancy to the English rendering .

		Translations which might otherwise have some merit are frequently marred by faults like the following : clumsy , involved , or too long sen - tences ; unnecessary verbiage ; too abrupt and staccato a style ; colloquial expressions in the midst of dignified speech ; solecisms and ana - chronisms ; too literal rendering of foreign idioms , and even failure to see that they are idioms ; illogical order of words or sequence of ideas ; too many indirect grammatical construc - tions , which render the thought vague and weak in expression ; lavish use of pronouns with an - tecedents unexpressed ; tautology , alliteration , and uneuphonious combinations ; and even con - siderable omissions of matter that is in the text .

		Most of these are very obvious faults , and their mention may seem to some superfluous ; but the following instances , actually encountered in editorial work , show that these suggestions are not altogether unnecessary .

		Some mistakes may be what our foreign cousins call ' errors of distraction , ^ -- such as translating marfil as ' marble ' ; norribre dc Jesus , ` number of Jesus ' -LRB- on a map of 1791 -RRB- ; guevos , ' guavas ' ; ' he caused his own head to be cut off ' -LCB- cabello being mistaken for cabeza -RRB- ; ' he sent for food a hundred salted cows . '

		But not as much can be said for such as these : * fastidious -LRB- pesadas -RRB- assaults upon her virtue ' ; ' a salutations method ' ; ' there is much and many good things to be said about them ' ; ' anointing her with holy water ' ; ' mainlands that nobody had as yet found out ' ; * which matters it is very important to remedy , in order to avoid present tendencies going still further ' -LRB- should be , * these matters should be considered , and some corrective be found to avoid further difiiculties ' -RRB- ; ` it is necessary , in very truth , that it be endeavored to have this and to attain it ' -LRB- should be , ' that an earnest ejffort be made to maintain what we now hold ' -RRB- ; ` thus the sentinels can not be held in check , nor the good collec - tions , which are necessary ' -LRB- should be ` on this account we can not maintain sentinel duty or the necessary precautions ' -RRB- .

		Still worse are such mistakes as these : A cer - tain statement of receipts and expenditures showed that the latter far exceeded the former ; at the end was the statement , ' the usual debt of the treasury is dollars annually , ' which was translated ' the balance in the treasury every year should be dollars . '

		Los loloes hicieron entradas en camucones was translated , ' the Joloes came here with chamois-skins ' ; it should be rendered , ' the Joloans made raids among the Camucones . '

		Another translator placed in the mouth of a Roman Catholic priest the words of a quotation from the Bible in the rendering of the
King James	LOCATION	version -- at once a solecism and an anachronism , as the priest 's letter was written two years before that version was pub - lished .

		Lord
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	's translation of Pigafet - ta 's Voyage -LRB-
Hakluyt Society	ORGANIZATION	's publications -RRB- furnishes some rather surprising slips of this sort ; couteaux et forces is rendered ' knives and forks ' instead of ' knives and scissors ' ; est de la longueur d'un naveau , ' is of the length of a shuttle , ' instead of ' is as long as a turnip ' -LRB- in describing the potato -RRB- ; both of these plainly jumping at conclusions .

		In one of
Piga	ORGANIZATION	- fetta 's vocabularies , he says .

		La pouldre dherhe qui mangent = capac ;
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	makes this .

		La pouldre dherhe = qui ; mangent = ^ capac .

		But words fail us to characterize properly such naive statements as these : ' I will send you advices by the next Japanese steamer ' -LRB- written in
1594	DATE	-RRB- ; or ' In
summer	DATE	the inhabitants of
Cape Breton Island	LOCATION	live very well on parrots and monkeys ' ; or this astounding exhortation from a priest to his brother , ' Let your heart collapse with the outbursts of love that you eject toward the Divine Goodness . '

		And it is difficult to un - derstand the mental process by which the follow - ing sentence was regarded as a translation of the words , Quatro galeras tengo en el agua y chusma para ellas de huenas hoyas a sueldo aunque mala yessa -- ' I have four galleys in the water , and lumber therefor of good buoyancy , at a good price , although there is but poor gypsum ' ; it should read , ' I have launched four galleys , and have for them a gang of voluntary paid rowers , although a poor one .

		Even that -- . '

		After all these things , come the psycholog - ical qualifications of a good translator ; ' and the greatest of these , ' yet the one most often conspicuous by its absence , is imagination -- an apparent paradox where rigid accuracy is re - quired , yet that faculty is really a prime requisite for the best work in translation .

		Often the true meaning of the original depends upon the writer 's profession , or his peculiar environ - ment , or his attitude toward the subject of which he writes , or his own personal tempera - ment ; and to understand it the translator needs the historical imagination which enables him to picture to himself the scenes and per - sons of a bygone day or a foreign land , to put himself into the writer 's place , and to see men and things through the latter 's eyes .

		No less important for the translator are a sympathetic insight which reveals to him the author 's
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 199 methods of thought and feeling , and entire candor and freedom from prejudice ; thus he can make the vrriter speak to the reader as if with his own and living voice .

		To this end , the translator must forget himself , and let his pen be moved by the writer 's spirit ; his main effort should be to reproduce the text , as nearly as possible , in such phrase and style as the author himself would have used if he had written in our language .

		Quick insight , delicate percep - tion , and fine intuition are most valuable in a translator 's equipment ; and as necessary in this work as in all others are patience , enthusiasm , and high ideals .

		The methods of the modem historical school render continually more requisite , and more imperatively demand , students qualified to make scholarly investigations , whose work shall be thorough , accurate , and reliable ; and who can present its results in such form as to be credit - able to themselves and acceptable to scholars .

		Such work ought to be done so well that it need not be compared , verified , and revised to make it fit for use ; but most editors and writers know only too well how rarely it can be found .

		The lack of such revision , and too ready confi - dence in one 's assistants , have , as we all know , brought clouds upon the scholarly reputation of more than one writer .

		Even in the minor matters of grammatical correctness , tj ` pograph - ical style , and handwriting , there are glaring deficiencies . '

		The woods are full ' of Ph.D. 's whose handwriting is almost undecipherable , whose punctuation is utterly erratic , and whose English is atrocious ; and some can not even write a hundred words without misspelling some of them .

		In view of these undisputed facts , and considering that most of the indis - cretions of translation above cited -LRB- but a few , alas !

		out of the dreary many that are com - mitted -RRB- were written by advanced graduate students in universities , it would seem that especial pains should be taken , somewhere in a student 's collegiate course , to ensure his being able , when he takes his A.M. -LRB- and still more his Ph.D. -RRB- degree , to write a translation , a magazine article , or a thesis , in at least respect - able English style and handwriting , so that it can be printed as it stands without disgracing him in those regards .

		Most advanced students , too , in any college of letters and arts , expect to do more or less literary or historical writing ; * this is demanded by their work , is in ever -RCB- way desirable for their professional success , and is in many cases regarded as necessary proof of a man 's ability and intellectual strength .

		Translation alone , without original work , affords congenial and honorable occupation for qualified persons .

		The universities and larger colleges may well be expected to do much toward equipping their students for creditable work as translators , edi - tors , and writers .

		To a certain extent , this is undoubtedly accomplished ; but the results are still far from satisfactory .

		In too many cases , the student emerges from his academic life '' firmly grasping the skeleton only of a language -LRB- the English not excepted -RRB- , and as firmly be - lieving , like
Don Quixote	PERSON	, that he is embracing his Dulcinea , ` queen of beauty ' -- and some - times even the skeleton soon becomes but dis - jecta membra .

		What is the use of spending six to nine years on the syntax , phonetics , phil - ology , and what not , of a language , unless one can make it alive in .

		his own thought , and rec - ognize the truth -LRB- as profound as simple -RRB- that language is the expression of thought ?

		and , of still more importance , that aU the languages are but variations of the one universal lan - guage , the varying methods of expressing thought ?

		The above-named accidents of language , without this result , constitute * a vicious circle , * in which too many students hopelessly revolve .

		Can not the universities and colleges establish special courses for seniors and graduates in which they can learn these things to somewhat better advantage than at present ; which -- not forgetting , however , that the best editors and translators are , like the poet , ' bom , not made ' -- shall train them in the simple , clear , and accurate presentation of thought , whether their own or another 's , and , in the latter case , at once with impartialitjr and sympathy ?

		This would be a valuable and dis - tinct gain to scholarship , and as well to the general reading public , which more and more avails itself of the results of that scholarship , and depends thereon as a basis for forming its own conclusions as to events , affairs , and men .

		* ' ^ This volume hath a pleasant look ; its air nimbly and sweetly recommends itself unto our gentle senses . '

		Thus , in slightly modified Shakespearian language , one greets Mrs.
Bay	PERSON	- ard
Taylor	PERSON	's attractive book , ' On Two
Conti	PERSON	- nents . '

		Nor does the promise of hospitable en - tertainment prove fallacious , as it so signally did in
Duncan	ORGANIZATION	's case on entering
Maobeth	PERSON	's cas - tle at
Inverness	LOCATION	.

		Mrs.
Taylor	PERSON	's antecedents , • environment , and personal traits , all have con - tributed to make her the very sort of person one would most like to hear chat on the subjects she has chosen .

		Her father , the well-known astronomer
Peter Andreas Hansen	PERSON	, an interesting character and a man of rare intellectual powers , was director of the ducal observatory at
Gotha	LOCATION	, being
Encke	ORGANIZATION	's successor in that position .

		It will sufficiently indicate his quality to say of him here that , though largely self-educated , this sturdy son of humble Danish parents would sometimes aston - ish his daughter by reciting , with much elo - quence , odes from
Horace	PERSON	, as he must have • equally surprised the astronomer Gauss by show - ing that he could repeat the
Gottingen	LOCATION	profes - sor 's tables of logarithms without the book .

		Skilled in languages and music , he delighted in '
Frithiof	PERSON	's Saga , ' and executed classical mas - terpieces on organ and piano .

		The mother was almost as remarkable in her way as the father in his .

		A beauty in her youth , she was descended from a stalwart line of Nimrods , huntsmen to the Duke of Saxe-Gotha and
Altenburg	PERSON	-LRB- no ^ \ - Saxe-Coburg-Gotha -RRB- .

		The father of this lady rose to be Forstmeister to Duke
August	DATE	.

		The customs of Mrs.
Taylor	PERSON	's girlhood , and her own dread of earning the reputation of a blue-stocking , forced her to make her intellec - tual acquisitions in secret .

		Of her literary abil - ity , the reading public has already had proof in the ' Life and Letters ' of her husband , the joint production of herself and Mr.
Scudder	PERSON	.

		This work is sufficiently well known to make here unnecessary any outline of her and her husband 's life together , the main theme of her present volume .

		Of the first meeting of these two , let the wife tell the storj '' in her own words .

		` In the
autumn of 1851	DATE	my mother 's brother - in-law , the landholder
August Bufleb	PERSON	, made a jour - ney to the Orient , an undertaking so unusual in those days that it created quite an excitement in our little town .

		in
Palestine	LOCATION	, but was induced by the Prussian Minister at
Constantinople	LOCATION	to make the trip to
Alexandria	LOCATION	, met on the steamer which ran from
Smyrna	LOCATION	to the latter port .

		Both travellers , the German and the American , although far removed in age , felt g , ttracted to each other at once , and formed a friendship which lasted as long as they lived ... On his return my uncle never tired of talking of his young American travelling com - panion , and thus we learned that he was seeking to recover in foreign countries from the deep wound which fate had dealt him in the loss of his first love , to whom he had been wedded on her death - bed .

		We were all anxious to make the young man 's acquaintance , and when in
September , 1852	DATE	, he came in fulfilment of his promise , the houses of the family in all its branches were opened to welcome him in the most hospitable manner , and even in more remote circles the appearance of this much - travelled stranger created a sensation .

		All who came in contact with him were attracted toward him , and he , for his part , in spite of the inherited reserve of his nature , was warm in praise of Ger - man Gemuthliehkeit .

		This quality was even in - herent in his own blood , as the ancestors of both his grandmothers had been German colonists .

		He was at that time twenty-seven j' ears old , his tall figure was still slender , his oval face deeply browned by the sun of the Orient .

		He gave the impression of an unusual , unspoiled , good and noble man , and thus he remained in my memory .

		I knew him but slightly at that time , as I met him only at the various dinners which were given in his honor by the family .

		That he would be my future husband did not enter my mind ; nor did I seem to make any deep impression upon him . '

		The circumstances attending the marriage of
Bayard Taylor	PERSON	and
Marie Hansen	PERSON	, in the
autumn of 1857	DATE	, and the difficulty over the lack - ing baptismal certificate , without which the banns could not lawfully be published , are curi - ously like the incidents relating to another Ger - man-American alliance recorded by ex-Ambas - sadoT White in his recent reminiscences .

		But the difference in dates forbids their identifica - tion .

		The bride 's first impressions of her adopted country are pleasantly given -- so pleas - antly , indeed , that even readers not yet aged may be pardoned a sigh for the good old times before immigration and plutocracy and strenu - osity had combined to transform the ancient order of things .

		Referring to her first winter in
New York	LOCATION	, Mrs.
Taylor	PERSON	writes : ` Poets , authors and artists were welcomed in our hospitable house , and
Stoddard	PERSON	wrote in later years of that time : `` We were a nest of singing birds . ''

Bayard Taylor	PERSON	was one of the most popular .

		Country folk drove untold miles to hear him , and his rapidly accumulating fees soon built him his fifteen-thousand-dollar country house at
Kennett Square	LOCATION	,
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, A passage from one of the lecturer 's early letters to his wife con - veys an idea of his fame in the land .

		` You would never guess that merchants , livery - stable keepers , mechanics and day laborers are among my admirers .

		The crowd was composed en - tirely of such .

		The baggageman on the train said to everybody , `` B. T. is in the car -- he is a big writer . ''

		`` What did he write ? ''

		asked a man .

		`` I do n't know what it was , '' was the reply , `` but he 's the biggest kind of a writer ! '' '

		Queer names oft ^ n came to
Taylor	PERSON	's notice in liis Western tours .

		Worth recording is the Christian name Lettice in c-onjunction with the surname Pray , an actual combination designat - ing a real woman , a * the reader is assured .

		A man once introduced his little son to the lec - turer in this wise : ' We call him Xapoleon , and his little sister we have named
St. Helena	ORGANIZATION	, after
Xapoleon	ORGANIZATION	's wife . '

		Before dropping the subject of human oddities , room must be made for the old spinster of good
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	family whom Mrs. Ta -RCB- lor knew at
Kennett Square	LOCATION	.

		This maiden lady , with even more than
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	thrift , for years was wont to use as a bread-trough the coffin she had caused to be prepared for her burial -- when she should no longer need bread , one is tempted frivolously to add .

		Many matters so agreeably touched on in
Stoddard	ORGANIZATION	's * Recollections ' here recur with a change of costume -- or , rather , are presented from a new point of view .

		The subjoined pas - sage is of interest in this connection : ` Each
Sunday	DATE	evening we saw a small select circle of friends congregate in our rooms .

		The Stoddards ,
Stedmans	PERSON	, McEntees ,
Aldrich	PERSON	,
Launt Thompson	PERSON	, the Grahams , were habitues , to whom were often added the two Cranches , Fitz-Hugh Ludlow and wife ,
Sanford Gifford	PERSON	, and sometimes
Edwin Booth	ORGANIZATION	and others .

		These evenings were en - livened by the ' ' Diversions , ' ' which in later years
Bayard Taylor	PERSON	published in amplified form in the `` Echo Club , '' and which afforded an entertain - ment sparkling with wit and humor .

		This amuse - ment was the continuation of a jeu d'esprit that originated in the middle of the fifties , when the trio of poets ,
Stoddard	PERSON	,
Taylor	PERSON	, and Fit z -
James O'Brien	PERSON	, vied in the exuberance of their imagina - tion with each other in the production of short comic poems whenever they met in
Stoddard	ORGANIZATION	's quarters .

		These poetic gymnastics , supplemented by parodies of noted poets , were a never-failing source of the most delightful entertainment .

		As soon as one of our sons of the Muses had finished his in - spiration of the moment , he read it aloud amid the laughing applause of his hearers , who were never at fault in guessing the poet he had parodied , so unmistakable was the imitation of the principal characteristics of his poetic expression . '

		An interesting chapter is devoted to
Taylor	PERSON	's - year at
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	, fir ^ t as Secretary of Legation , then as Charge d' Affaires in Minister
Cameron	PERSON	's absence .

		In the critical state of our eountn ^ at that time -LRB- 1862-3 -RRB- , the post held by
Taylor	PERSON	was one of responsibility .

		` It was necessary , in the face of any reverses - that the
Union	ORGANIZATION	army might suffer , to preserve the confidence of the
Eussian Government	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- hitherto the only friendly power -RRB- in the final victory of the North .

		As
Taylor	PERSON	himself was firmly convinced of the certainty of this ultimate triumph , he at length succeeded , after several long and very interesting interviews with Prince
Gortchacow	PERSON	, in enlisting the sympathies of this astute diplomat entirely on the side of the
Federal Government	ORGANIZATION	, and in firmly es - tablishing the friendship of the two powers --
Eossia	LOCATION	.

		and the
United States	LOCATION	.

		In these diplomatic con - versations the personal magnetism which my hus - band possessed in so great a measure may perhaps - have contributed not a little to this result . '

		` Easily , ' was the re - ply ; ` you need only think of the Graces , the Muses , and yourself . '

		Mrs.

		Gaus , ' ' esprit , ' ' Fratilein , ' and similar small errors , are encountered .

Percy F. Bicknell	PERSON	.

		The Art of Miniatures .

		* Forty years ago , the
South Kensington Museum	LOCATION	, in
London	LOCATION	, inaugurated its series of exhibitions of national portraits by bringing together a collection of over three thousand miniatures , chiefly British , which were not only collected and arranged but catalogued by the well-known art critic and historian of art , Mr.
Samuel Redgrave	PERSON	, in a volume with an appre - ciative introduction upon miniature art and an invaluable appendix of biographical data respecting the painters whose works were ex - hibited .

		From this exhibition can be dated the renascence of interest in this delightful branch of art , and its catalogue was the first contribu - tion to its history , so that each is entitled to the meed of praise due to pioneer work .

		No wide interest in the subject , however , seems to have been taken for a full score of years , when , upon the publication of Dr.
Lumsden	PERSON	Propert 's ' History of Miniature Art , ' with its wealth of beautiful illustrations , persons of taste and of means sought to gather examples of these ex - quisite gems , until to-day they form perhaps the most eagerly desired and the most highly prized collections in all the departments of the fine arts .

		This taste led to a demand for a lit - erature of the subject , which has been freely supplied by the volumes of Foster and of
Williamson	LOCATION	.

		But these were intended to be popular , and were built upon the false hypoth - esis that to be popular it is not necessary to be • Miniatures .

		They also so plainly showed the want of technical knowledge on the part of their authors , a knowledge absolutely necessary when writing upon any scientific subject , that they were not only far from satisfying to the intelli - gent student but quite misleading to the mere dilettante ; and therefore it was a matter of much importance to those seriously interested in the subject , when it was announced that Mr.
Dudley Heath	PERSON	, a scion in the fourth generation of a notable line of artists , and himself well equipped to follow them , was engaged upon a work on Miniatures , to be issued in the ' Con - noisseur 's Library . '

		The volume , now before us , leaves nothing of moment to be desired .

		It is historical , it is technical where it should be , it is scientific , it is critical ; and above all it is interesting from cover to cover , so that in per - using it or in studying it one can not help but feel he is being instructively led by a writer who has understood and carefully considered and weighed the subject upon which he treats .

		Unfortunately , there are few works for which so much as this can advisedly be said ; and Mr.
Heath	PERSON	's treatise upon Miniatures stands out in bold relief in comparison with the many short - comings of his forerunners in the same field .

		The opening chapters of the book are devoted to a consideration of the origin of the mini - ature portrait , its growth in the illuminated rrianuscripts of the eleventh to the fifteenth centuries , and the influence of the art of print - ing on the art of the miniaturist or illuminator .

		This period of art development was purely
Continental	ORGANIZATION	; for in
England	LOCATION	the art of paint - ing hardly had an existence at the end of the
Middle Ages	LOCATION	, and it was
Hans Holbein	PERSON	, a Ger - man of
Augsburg	LOCATION	, born five years after the dis - covery of this continent , who introduced the art of portrait miniature into
Britain	LOCATION	and with such success that she has since retained an almost exclusive preeminence in the art .

		To such a degree is this true that the art of por - trait miniature may be considered in some ways ' exclusively an English art . '

		Its great - est exponents have been Englishmen , whose works , while ` limned in little , ' bear compar - ison with the greatest portraits of the world .

		Yet Englishmen do not forget the German who introduced the beautiful art into their island , and some few months ago they paid tribute to his art and fame by giving the unprece - dented sum of
$ 13,750	MONEY	for a fine miniature from his hand .

		The pages given to
Holbein	LOCATION	by Mr.
Heath	PERSON	are particularly to be commended , as they form a key to the method of the entire work , -- finely critical and judicial without being captious and hard .

		THE DTAT .

		^ 03 and paralleling the different painters , from
Milliard	ORGANIZATION	and the two Olivers , father and son , representatives of the first period of portrait miniature of the English school , with whom the traditions of the illuminators may be said to have passed away , to
John Hoskins	PERSON	and his nephew
Samuel Cooper	PERSON	, leaders in the develop - ment , under the influence of
Vandyke	ORGANIZATION	, of the seventeenth century as the greatest epoch in the English art of miniature portrait painting , down through its decadence in the next century `` to its extinction in the middle of the last cen - tury , when , with the birth of sun-pictures and the passing away of
Kobertson	LOCATION	,
Newton	LOCATION	, and
Ross	PERSON	, miniature painting as a fine art may be said to have taken its place among the lost arts .

		Mr.
Heath	PERSON	's studies of the different painters are very skilfully drawn .

		Of
Cooper	PERSON	lie says : * To
Samuel Cooper	PERSON	must be given the proud position , of supremacy in his art ... He ex - celled all his predecessors , and has never been equalled by any miniaturist since , far less sur - passed .

		In fact , it is hardly too much to say that
Samuel Cooper	PERSON	's art contains the finest qualities possible in the miniature portrait ; character , ex - pression , breadth , vigour , and solidity , combined with masterly balance of light and shade , sim - plicity and dignity of colour , and withal a grace and nobility of treatment which more than coun - terbalance the lack of minute finish , for which he las sometimes been disadvantageously compared with
Isaac Oliver	PERSON	. '

		If to this analysis anj-thing can be added , it is to note the great distinction of
Coopers	ORGANIZATION	por - traits and to emphasize more strongly his won - derful breadth of treatment in so small a scale , `` which is the key-note to
Walpole	LOCATION	's oft-quoted • eulogy , ' If a glass could expand
Coopers	ORGANIZATION	pic - tures to the size of
Tandyke	ORGANIZATION	's , they would ap - pear to have been painted to that proportion .

		If his portrait of Cromwell could be so en - larged , I do not know but
Vandyke	ORGANIZATION	would ap - pear less great by comparison . '

		Of
John Smart	PERSON	, Mr ,
Heath	ORGANIZATION	writes : ` Without any ostentatious cleverness , Smart painted with a thoroughness and delicacy which liave a charm of their own , and his miniatures no doubt appealed to that less '' flash '' portion of so - • ciety which valued an excellent portrait more than an idealized semblance of a person .

		Though the miniatures by
John Smart	PERSON	are often considered to `` be of exceptional merit , and at the present time fetch fancy prices , I am inclined to think that their laborious and over-modelled gradations of the flesh - tints place them outside the category of master - pieces . '


Ozias Humphrey	PERSON	, he says , ' was one of the most tjharming miniaturists of the eighteenth cen - tury ... He is certainly one of those mini - aturists whose work stands out as unique for its beauty of execution , its mellowness of c-olour and tone , and graceful arrangement . '

		Mr.
Heath	PERSON	could have gone much further in his appreciation of
Humphrey	PERSON	had he judged him by his oriental miniature portraits , which seem to be unknown to him , and without fear have placed him next to
Cooper	PERSON	, for his characteriza - tion , breadth of handling , and atmospheric qualities of tone and color , which easily make
Humphrey	PERSON	the first miniature painter of his time .

		To many , with the glamour of
Richard Cosway	PERSON	's dainty work in mind , this will seem impossible .

		But read what Mr.
Heath	PERSON	has to say of this idol of fashion , a view the present writer has always entertained : ` From the middle of the eighteenth century tiU the middle of the nineteenth , we have an uninter - rupted array of excellent miniaturists , but during the whole of that period , and even to the present day , the name of
Eichard Cosway	ORGANIZATION	has dominated all others .

		This prolonged and universal admiration of an artist is in itsefi a most eloquent eulogium on his merits , though it is not necessarily a convincing proof of his claim to this preeminence .

		That an admiration of
Cosway	PERSON	's style is well justified 1 should be the first to allow , but I would also insist that infatuation is not indicative of intelligent appreciation , -- that to be sensible of the charm and graceful genius of a Cosway should not make us insensible to the great and noble qualities of a
Cooper	ORGANIZATION	.

		If the eighteenth century genius pleases our most sensitive tastes and appetites , the seven - teenth century genius stirs our deepest sympathies and appreciations .

		It is impossible to deny the charm which a fine Cosway possesses ; its refinement , its grace , its delicate dexterity appeal at once to our sense of the beautiful .

		The directness and easy finesse of the handling , the subtle balance of tone , colour , and modelling , give added power io the expression , forcing us , as it were , to admire what our better judgment would proclaim as insin - cere ... Where the art of Cosway fails is in the limitations of his inspiration or vision .

		He may be described as a man who had chained him - self to a fetish -- a standard of beauty -- ^ which denied him the power of free vision - A face was to him but a mask , more or less capable of being conformed to his convention of the beautiful ; but having been conformed , then he expressed himself with aU the grace , facility , subtlety , and charm that were peculiar to his genius . '

		This excellent criticism of
Cosway	ORGANIZATION	's art will hardly commend itself to the twentieth century connoisseur , but if it were widely diffused among and digested by them , it might help to reduce the traffic in spurious Cosway s which to - day flood the market and find their way into cabinets composed of nothing , according to the view of the owner , but ' authentic and orig - inal works . '

		With a work such as this before us , there is a strong temptation to forget we are writing a review of a book and not a book itself ; and I think I have gone far enough to show that Mr.
Heath	PERSON	has done his work with exceptional thoroughness and skill .

		There is only one point in which the book is singularly and unfortun - ately deficient .

		The closing pages are given up to ' Foreign Portrait Miniaturists , ' and 204 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	^ we read of Ital -RCB- - ,
Germany	LOCATION	, and
France	LOCATION	, but not a word of
America	LOCATION	or the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Can it be possible that a man as broad and as en - lightened as Mr.
Heath	PERSON	does not know of us and our miniature painters ?

		Is it possible that a man who has given so much study to the subject in hand has never heard of Ed - ward
Greene Malbone	PERSON	, to say nothing of the Peales , and
Trumbull	ORGANIZATION	, Wood ,
Trott	PERSON	, Field , and Staigg ?

		He does not even mention
John Singleton Copley	PERSON	, who lived in
England	LOCATION	from
1774	DATE	until his death in
1815	DATE	, and painted mini - atures both here and there .

		But is there not a revelation and a treat in store for Mt. Heath * when he does see the best of
Malbone	ORGANIZATION	's exquisite miniatures !

		With his fine critical sense , will he not take off his hat and leading him by the hand place him after
Cooper	PERSON	, shoulder to shoulder with
Ozias Humphrey	PERSON	, in the van , ahead of
Richard Cosway	PERSON	?

		It is to be the writer 's privilege soon to tell the history of American Miniatures so curiously over - looked by Mr.
Heath	PERSON	.

		A word must be added as to the forty-two plates contained in the volume , few of which , by the way , are bound in where the index places them .

		The processes employed , photo - gravure , collotype , and three-color printing , may be the best available for book purposes , but none of them is satisfying for reproduc - ing miniatures as miniatures .

		All they accom - plish is to make pictures of the miniatures .

		They reduce every man 's work to a technical equality .

		They are of no help as aids to study .

		The photogravure has the disadvan - tageous mending of the intermediary engraver ; and the collotype is broken up past recall .

		The color-plate has no value whatever as illustrating the color sense of the painter whose work it reproduces ; it merely gives the color scheme , and that not very well .

		According to the color plates in this volume , the sense and feeling for color of the limner of Philip the Good , in the
fifteenth century	DATE	, of Mansion , in the nineteenth , of
Cooper	PERSON	and of Cosway , are almost precisely the same .

		Will not some expert experiment with reproductive processes until he conquers these deficiencies ?

		style .

		Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	is nothing if not clever , -- so clever , indeed , that he anticipates all the reviewer 's descriptions of him .

		For instance , nothing would be pleasanter than to say of Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	that he is one of the most brilliant and one of the most honest men alive , but that we are concerned with him , not in this capacity , but in that of heretic , -- that is to say , a man whose philosophy is quite solid , quite coherent , and quite wrong ; nothing would be pleasanter than to say this if Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	had not al - ready said it of Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	.

		Again , no description could more aptly be applied to the critic than this : ' The message upon which he has really concentrated is the only thing worth worrying about in him or in any other man .

		He has often written bad poetry , like Words - worth .

		He has often said silly things , like Plato .

		He has often given way to mere polit - ical hysteria , like
Gladstone	PERSON	.

		But no one can reasonably doubt that he means steadily and sincerely to say something , and the only serious question is .

		What is that which he has tried to say ? '

		Unfortunately , Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	fore - stalled such a criticism by applying it to Mr. .

		Eudyard Kipling .

		It is trite , as well as wrong , to say of Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	that he will never be taken seriously until he takes himself and the world more seriously .

		He believes in himself as firmly as it is possible for a man to believe whose the - ories of life and progress are based on that very faith .

		And he believes in the world , not in detail , but in the mass , as cosmos .

		If he laughs at
Chesterton	LOCATION	and at the world , it is the laugh of understanding , not of derision .

		His humor , his paradoxes , his recurring epigrams , are not the marks of weakness or insincerity in his philosophy but of strength in his style .

		He is able to laugh because he sees things large .

		If he is weak , it is not in being funny , but in being fallacious .

		It is hard to conceive of his equal in the natural instinct to feel things rightly , and the ability to twist them in the saying .

		His book would make an invaluable addition to the literature of logical fallacies .

		Recurring to his own question of what it is that he has tried to say , we find that he means , , first and finally , that the modern affectation of indifference to all eternal things is unprogres - sive and debasing .

		When , at the beginning of the great nineteenth century , scientists re - nounced religion and philosophy for facts , they made a new religion and a new philosophy for themselves .

		They were substituting one creed '' for another , calling God the Final Cause .

		The ultimate questions were quite as much in their minds as in that of the most devout priest or the most ascetic monk .

		To-day nothing ulti - mate is supposed to matter to anybody .

		As Mr -
Chesterton	ORGANIZATION	writes :
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE jyiAJL * We are more and more to discuss details in art , politics , literature .

		A man 's opinion on tram-cars matters ; his opinion on Botticelli matters ; his opin - ion on all things does not matter .

		He may turn over and explore a million objects , but he must not find that strange object , the universe ; for if he does he will have a religion and be lost .

		Everything matters , except everything .

		This was certainly not the idea of those who introduced our freedom .

		When the old Liberals removed the gags from all the heresies , their idea was that religious and philo - sophical discoveries might thus be made .

		Their view was that cosmic truth was so important that everj ` one ought to bear independent testimony .

		The modem idea is that cosmic truth is so unimportant that it can not matter what anyone says .

		The former freed inquiry as men loose a noble hound ; the latter frees inquiry as men fling back into the sea a fish unfit for eating . '

		It is certainly preposterous that in a civiliza - tion boastful of its progress , nobody but the - orists and dreamers should have any definite ideal of progress : that in a civilization proud of its freedom , nobody thinks to define or limit liberty ; that in an age when everybody thinks his own thoughts , so few people really think anything .

		Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	is right .

		The most necessan - thing in the world is for men to have definite opinions about matters that are vitaL As a study of certain men who have definite opinions , Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's book is interesting in its material , and through his brilliant hand - ling it is interesting in form .

		But it is not definitive , because it is not convincing .

		One of his most definite opinions is that science , especially that science which has human nature as one of its factors , is wrong in everj ` thing .

		With this as major premise , he arsrues cleverly against all theories of folk-lore , all scientific philanthropy , sociology , ethnology . '

		Science and the Savages , ' * Sandals and Simplicity , ' * Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	and the
Giants	ORGANIZATION	, ' are attractive headings , and the reader who plunges into the discussion without expecting a trap in the first sentence is apt to be caught in the sparkle of Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's theories .

		Moreover , the author states a wrong idea so boldly and so surely that it takes a person of definite mind to contradict him .

		-- as in these statements : ` When the modern world praises its little Csesars , it talks of being strong and brave ; but it does not seem to see the eternal paradox involved in the conjunction of these ideas .

		The strong can not be brave ; only the weak can be brave ; and yet again in practise , only those who can be brave can be trusted , in time of doubt , to be strong . '

		` Men trust an ordinary man because they trust themselves .

		But men trust a great man because they do not trust themselves .

		And hence the wor - ship of great men always appears in times of weak - ness and cowardice ; we never hear of great men until the time when all other men are small . '

		` There is one broad fact about the relations of Christianity and Paganism which is so simple and so clear that many will smile at it , but which is so important that all moderns forget it .

		The primary fact about Christianity and Paganism is that one came after the other . '

		Nothing could be more false than this last statement in tlie application which is made of it .

		Christianity was not a revolt or a develop - ment from Paganism , but from Judaism .

		That Pagans became Christians did not mean that Pagan virtues and ideals , transmuted into Christian virtues and ideals , were all of the world 's spiritual history - .

		The gap , which is the largest part , is unaccounted for in Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's argument .

		Even in lesser things he is careless about the use of evidence .

		In urging the beauty and the sjTnbolism of the ritual of religion and of chivalry against the ritual of social usage , he says : ' What can be more solemn and absurd , considered in the ab - stract , than symbolizing the existence of the other sex by taking off a portion of your cloth - ing and waving it in the air ? '

		This is just the example that Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	would not have used , if he had remembered that taking off one 's hat to a lady is a remnant of the days of chivalry when soldiers and knights doffed their helmets to signify a truce to hostilities in the presence of the opposite six .

		On the very next page , however , Mr.
Ches	PERSON	- terton writes something so full of insight that his errors are easily forgiven .

		` It is idle to inveigh against cynics and material - ists .

		There are no cynics , there are no materialists .

		Every man is idealistic ; only it so often happens that he has the wrong ideal .

		Every man is incur - ably sentimental ; but , unfortunately , it is so often a false sentiment .

		When we talk , for instance , of some unscrupulous commercial figure , and say that he would do anything for money , we use quite an inaccurate expression , and we slander him very much .

		He would not do anything for money .

		He would do some things for money ; he would sell his soul for money , for instance ; and , as Mirabeau humorously said , he would be quite wise to `` take money for muck . ''

		He would oppress humanity for money ; but then it happens that humanity and the soul are not things that he believes in ; they are not his ideals .

		But he has his own dim and deli - cate ideals ; and he would not violate these for money .

		He would not drink out of the soup-tureen , for money .

		He would not wear his coat-tails in front , for money .

		He would not spread a report that he had softening of the brain , for money .

		In the actual practice of life we find , in the matter of ideals , exactly what we have already found in the matter of ritual .

		We find that while there is a perfectly genuine danger of fanaticism from the men who have unworldy ideals , the permanent and urgent danger of fanaticism is from the men who have worldly ideals . '

		So it is all through the book ; one page amuses by its originality of conception and expression , the next provokes by its insecurity of argument , the third charms by its suggest - iveness .

		It is a book to be relished , not as a whole , but in snatches .

		With all its half-play - ful cynicism , it seems to be in the main sin - cere ; and the opinions it so brilliantly ex - presses regarding some of the most interesting men and movements of the time are well worth attention .

Oct. 1	DATE	,
John Knox	PERSON	, Hero or Villain ?

		* That two volumes on
John Knox	PERSON	, the latest of a long list of biographies of the great
Scot	PERSON	- tish reformer , were published almost simul - taneously more than three hundred years after his death , shows the perennial interest that the world takes in the stem old leader of the Pur - itan forces in the
Eeformation	LOCATION	, If , as has been maintained , a test of greatness is the waning or the endurance of a man 's reputation aft ^ r his death , certainly
John Knox	PERSON	must be ranked as one of the greatest men of modern history .

		The wide divergence of judgment as to his character and his methods of controversy shown by these two sincere writers indicates that the differences in men 's ways of looking at things that led to the bitter strifes of the re - ligious wars are fundamental to our human nature , and , though softened and christianized , still exist among us .

		Dr.
Henry Cowan	PERSON	's
Life of Knox	ORGANIZATION	is a straightforward biography , written from full knowledge by one who is in general sympathy with the
Eeformer	ORGANIZATION	's methods and aims .

		The author 's purpose , as expressed in his own words , is , in the limited space at his disposal , ` to de - scribe those portions of the career of
Knox	PERSON	which are most likely to be of general interest ; to place his life-work in its historical setting ; to facilitate for students the consultation of original authorities ; and to present a picture of the Eeformer which , without concealing his in - firmities , would help to vindicate his enrollment alike among the foremost heroes of the Eefor - mation , and among the greatest and noblest of Scotsmen . '

		The book is thus not a judicial statement of the facts of
Knox	PERSON	's career and of the many bitter controversies that filled it full ; the author is an advocate , but he is fair , digni - fied , and moderate in his advocacy of
Knox	PERSON	's side of these questions and of the general course of his conduct as a Puritan leader .

		He does not gloss over the infirmities of his hero , -- the coarse vituperation of his opponents , men or women , which was the accepted style of contro - versial writing among the best of the men of that time , or the occasional violence and even revolting cruelty of the measures that he advo - cated in the heat of conflict .

		But he does give full weight to all that is favorable , and tries to account for all that is unfavorable , in the facts of
Knox	PERSON	's life : this , indeed , is to be expected in one who undertakes to write a biography of a ` hero . '

		in his defiance of those in authority who stood for what he would destroy , and in facing per - secution and danger for the sake of his con - victions ; of faith in God , in his own call to be God 's servant , and in the ultimate triumph of what he firmly believed to be the divine cause ; and of the courage and confidence , even in dis - aster , that would follow such faith .

		He finds also in him an intolerance which was greater than that of his intolerant age , uncharitable judgments of those whom he disliked , even condonation of assassinations that removed enemies of his cause ; thousrh he would palliate somewhat these unlovely traits of his hero 's character .

		Of chief importance Dr.
Cnwnn	PERSON	ranks the great and enduring influence of
Knox	ORGANIZATION	upon
Scotland	LOCATION	.

		He attributes largely to that influ - ence the opposition to royal despotism which culminated in a rebellion ' which history has vindicated and posterity has ratified ; ' the growth of an intelligent and earnest-minded middle-class , which
Knox	PERSON	inspired with strong religious convictions and irnbnprl with a sense of national responsibility ; the parochial-school organization , ' which during subsequent gen - erations , when most other countries lagged be - hind in this regard , provided for the poorest in the land a sound religious and secular educa - tion .

		We have only now , moreover , begun to realize some of the
Eeformer	ORGANIZATION	's educational ideals , -- the Calvinism that has done so much to shape Scottish character and thought , and that principle of Presbyterian church govern - ment that combined the recognition of the laity in the administration of the church with or - derly subordination of the whole church to one supreme authority , ' avoiding the dangers of both hierarchy and anarchy . '

		Dr.
Cowan	PERSON	notes the wide spread of
Knox	PERSON	's influence wherever Scotsmen have gone to live ; also that he is the founder of the English and Irish Presbyterian Churches , and hence of the American , and is in some measure the preserver of English Protes - tantism .

		He quotes the English historian
Froude	PERSON	as declaring that ' but for
Knox	PERSON	,
Mary Stuart	PERSON	would have bent
Scotland	LOCATION	to her pur - pose , and
Scotland	LOCATION	would have been the lever with which
France	LOCATION	and
Spain	LOCATION	would have worked upon
England	LOCATION	until
Elizabeth	PERSON	had either been hurled from her throne or been con - strained to go back into the
Egypt	LOCATION	of Eoman - ism ' ; and he attributes to the iniiuence of
Knox	PERSON	that Covenanter spirit that played so large a part in the history of English liberty in the next century .

		The value of the book is en - hanced by a large number of valuable illustra - tions .

		The second book , the work of the well-known historian and man-of - letters , Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	,
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 207 differs as widel -RCB- * from Dr.
Cowan	PERSON	's as one biog - raphy can differ from another .

		In fact , Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's book is not a biography at all ; it is a controversial pamphlet of large size , the thesis of which is a quotation from * The Diurnal ' under the date of
Knox	PERSON	's death : '
John Knox	PERSON	, minister , deceased , who had , as was alleged , the most part of the blame of all the sorrows of
Scotland	LOCATION	since the slaughter of the late Car - dinal . '

		From the beginning to the end of his book , Mr.
Lang	PERSON	employs all the resources of his literary art , irony , denunciation , special plead - ing , to discredit the great Eeformer .

		He at - tributes to him the principles of a
Macchiavelli	ORGANIZATION	, and a prudence that led him to shun dangers to himself however ready he might be to denounce others who showed like prudence .

		He accuses
Knox	PERSON	of numberless misstatements in his His - tory , extending even to the perversion of the facts of history to justify his acts and those of his party .

		On nearly every page is a fling at KJnox , the following being an example : '
Knox	PERSON	, as to the doctrine of '' killing no murder , '' was a man of his time .

		But
Knox	PERSON	, in telling the story of a murder which he approves , unhappily displays a glee imbecoming a reformer of the Church of Him who blamed St.
Peter	PERSON	for his recourse to the sword .

		The very essence of Christianit -RCB- ' is cast to the winds when KJnox utters his laughter over the murders or misfor - tunes of his opponents , yielding '' to the strong propensity which he felt to indulge his vein of humour . ''

		Other good men rejoiced in the mur - der of an enemy , but KJnox chuckled . '

		This is not fair play , though it be sharp writing .

		It is to be admitted that Mr.
Lang	PERSON	carries us with him in many of his attacks upon the consistency and spirit of the Reformer , but he himself * chuckles ' overmuch , and allows far too little for the spirit of the time that shapes the char - acter and thought of even its leaders and heroes .

		The book is simply the life-story of a Breton noble - man , of violent passions and astounding in - ability to avoid the paths of obvious folly .

		It begins by depicting his unregulated childhood in
Brittany	LOCATION	, describes his later career as a de - serter from the
French navy	ORGANIZATION	, a wanderer over many seas and lands , and a victim of a vulgar liaison , and ends in a squalid lodging-house of
New York	LOCATION	, where he lies desperately ill with pneumonia , and we do not know -LRB- or greatly care -RRB- whether he is going to live through it .

		The early Breton chapters are much the best part of the book , for in them the story has a genuine atmosphere ; of the unreal melodrama that follows there is little to be said in the way of praise .

		We close it with a sense of exasperation at the recklessness of its composi - tion and its wasteful use of what might have been the material of an admirable work .

		The well-worn theme of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's last des - perate effort to retrieve his shattered fortunes is chosen by Mr.
Max Pemberton	PERSON	for his latest romance . '

		The Hundred Days ' begins just be - fore the Emperor 's escape from
Elba	ORGANIZATION	, and ends just after the defeat of
Waterloo	LOCATION	.

		We have the usual brave hero and captivating heroine , the one an Englishman in disfavor at home and living a secluded life in Fl-ance , the other an adventuress in the secret service of
Napoleon	LOCATION	.

		The story offers the conventional blend of fact with romantic fiction , is narrated in somewhat indistinct fashion , and proves but moderately exciting . '

		The Bandolero , ' like Mr.
Paul Gwynne	PERSON	's earlier novels , is a romance of Spanish life .

		In writing of
Spain	LOCATION	, Mr.
Gwynne	PERSON	is no casual out - sider , but an observer whose knowledge of his subject is extensive and intimate .

		He knows the life of town and country , the customs , the superstitions , and the folklore of the Spanish people .

		He is also by way of being a psycholo - gist in his interpretation of motives and modes of thought .

		This thoroughness of equipment , combined with a very pretty knack of compo - sition , and the ability to construct an interest - ing plot , makes these Spanish novels of his about the best of their kind . '

		The Bandolero ' is a story of revenge , tempered in the end by something like Christian forgiveness .

		The brigand hero was once a valiant officer , but , under the pressure of a grievous wrong , he has become the enemy of society , and achieve -LRB- f a new kind of fame as the leader of a band of desperados .

		His story is , in short , that of Her - nani .

		Upon his wronger he takes the terrible revenge of kidnapping his only child , and con - cealing him so effectually from discovery that the child grows up to manhood as a peasant , ' with no notion of his real station .

		But the brigand chieftain has also a girl-child of his - own , left in the same rustic care ; and the two children , when they are old enough , become lovers , to the horror of the girl 's father .

		His efforts to separate them prove futile , and in the end he becomes reconciled to their union , ceases to be an outlaw and enters the government ser - vice , almost forgives his ancient enemy , an < l dies in a fierce struggle with one of his old - time associates .

		The romance is thoroughly in - teresting , and has a considerable degree of lit - erary charm .

		Mr.
George Gary Eggleston	PERSON	, who served as a Confederate soldier in the Civil War , has again turned to account his recollections of that con - flict in ' A Daughter of the South . '

		The war does not exactly enter into the substance of this romance , but rather supplies a background ; for the interest is almost wholly of a private character .

		The hero is a man engaged in the dangerous business of purchasing cotton in the blockaded South , and bringing it to the North - ern market .

		The heroine is a damsel in distress -- a French girl from
New Orleans	LOCATION	-- whom he finds hiding in a swamp upon the occasion of one of his expeditions , and rescues from star - vation and other perils .

		The story also deals with various forms of rascality on the part of the conscienceless money-makers who found in the war their opportunity to plunder and de - fraud .

		It embodies much curious information concerning this oygone period ; but the author 's language makes singular lapses into modernity , and his art must be described as crude .

		Never - theless , he tells a story of some interest , and keeps fairly in touch with reality .

		Mr.
Harris Dickson	PERSON	, in ' The Eavanels , ' has given us an excellent piece of workmanship .

		The novel has both strength and character , ^ besides a romantic plot of much dramatic in - terest .

		Mr.
Dickson	PERSON	is a Mississippian , and a lawyer by profession ; his story is of a feud orig - inating in the early days of reconstruction , and culminating a generation later in a mysterious murder .

		The trial of the hero fills something like two-thirds of the whole book ; and here , as a
Mississippi	LOCATION	lawyer , the author is upon his own

		THE DIAL 209 ground .

		An ingenious explanation of the mys - tery is followed by the acquittal of the hero ; and all ends happily . '

		The
House of Cards	ORGANIZATION	' is a novel written in an exasperating style , of which the following specimen may serve us for both example and introduction : ' True , Mr.
Cards	PERSON	himself says something between his teeth as a big red devil of an automobile -- hybrid word for a hybrid thing begotten and beloved of a hybrid brum - magem breed of sports -- with a measly little parvid parvenu of an owner , and his fireman -LCB- chauffeur indeed !

		I say ' * fireman , '' and be burned to him ! -RRB-

		, snorts up and sets our horses to a dance . '

		A book written in this jargon does not make easy reading , but the present produc - tion has so much pith that we are inclined to advise a struggle with its strained figures ancT thorny constructions .

		As our extract shows .

		Cards is a man 's name , and not the mere inno - cent substantive that one might fancy , albeit there is a clear intention of allegory in the title .

		Briefly , the
House of Cards	ORGANIZATION	is a colossal finan - cial edifice , its foundations laid during the Civil `` War , when it was concerned with the negotia - tion of government loans , and its superstructure raised and rivetted during the forty years fol - lowing .

		Since the scene is
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, there is offered a suggestion -- ^ but only a suggestion -- of the operations of the late
Jay Cooke	PERSON	.

		The history of the
House	ORGANIZATION	, as here presented , is curiously interwoven with the history of the Civil War , although that gigantic upheaval is used by the novelist as a motive for a somewhat cynical vein of moralizing , rather than as a source of picturesque material .

		In fact , there is very little story about the book , but instead a great deal of shrewd comment and incisive characterization .

		What it all leads up to is a rather impressive presentation of the
Ameri	PERSON	- can society of to-day , based upon corrupt - politics and the domination of the great cor - porations .

		These conditions seem to be fairly fixed upon us , and the writer makes it clear that they are not easily to be swept away .

		He accepts them as an inevitable phase of our national development , and almost seems to con - done them .

		Yet there is an undercurrent of suggestion that selfish materialism is not to be the last word of our civilization , and that a sufficiently resolute onslaught will some day make the
House of Cards	ORGANIZATION	topple over .

		This is what the hero stands for , -- a figure barely sketched , but destined , in some dimly veiled future , to play the part of the stripling
David	PERSON	to the Goliath of plutocracy . '

		The Boss of Little
Arcady	PERSON	' is so much better than anything that Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	has here - tofore written that we are compelled to revise | our former very moderate estimate of his abili - ties .

		His Mormon story and his novel of theo - logical discussion were lumbering in their gait and deadly in their seriousness ; but his new book has leisurely ease of movement and a humor that is simply captivating .

		It is a story of life in a countr -RCB- - town of central
Illinois	LOCATION	as far as it is a stor -RCB- -- at all -- ^ but its charm is al - most wholly one of incident , and of the genial delineation of village types .

		He who has once made their acquaintance will not readily forget
J. Rodney Potts	PERSON	and Little Arcady 's heroic ef - forts to dispense with his society ; or the local editor ,
Solon Denny	PERSON	, and his suffering under the chastening hand of the severe lady from
Boston	LOCATION	; or
Billy Durgin	PERSON	, the boy detective ; or
Clem	PERSON	, the faithful slave who refuses to be emancipated ; or Miss
Caroline	PERSON	from
Virginia	LOCATION	, ` who causes such a fluttering of the village dove - cotes ; or the philosophical biographer and his - torian , who contrives to attract our interest to himself no less than to these creatures of hi ^ describing .

		And with all this prodigal and appealing humor there is a blend of humaniz - ing sentiment that is also very charming , and the combination is so deftly made that each of these two elements serves to heighten the other .

		We congratulate Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	upon the new gait that he has now struck , and venture to predict that , if steadfastly pursued , it will lea!d him ^ ^ ''

		The winning * A History of the
Pacific North	LOCATION	- of
Oregon	LOCATION	.

		west ' -LRB- MacmiUan -RRB- is the title of a recent volume dealing with the establishment of American power beyond the
Rocky Mountains	LOCATION	.

		The literature of ` expansion ' has been growing rapidly of late , and will doubt - less continue to grow for some time to come ; unfortunately , however , this literature is often wanting in some of the qualities that we expect to find in true historv .

		Still , much excellent work has been done in this field , and it is a pleas - ure to note that the work before us belongs to this class .

		The author , Professor
Joseph Schafer	PERSON	, of
the University of Oregon	ORGANIZATION	, has for some years been engaged in studying the historical materials of the
Pacific States	LOCATION	, and in this work he tells the early history of the
Oregon	LOCATION	country .

		With the later history of this region -- the development of its vast resources during the last half-centurj ' and the political careers of the various States carved out of it -- the author is not much con - cerned ; his purpose is to give a clear and read - able account of how the valley of the
Columbia River	LOCATION	was won for the
American Republic	ORGANIZATION	and for American civilization .

		Professor
Schafer	PERSON	goes back to the memorable day when
Balboa	LOCATION	first saw 210 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, the
South Sea	LOCATION	, discusses the great interest that this discovery aroused in the European mind , and traces the progress of Spanish exploration as for a hundred and fifty years it slowly crept up the
Pacific	LOCATION	shore .

		This is followed by an account of the fur-trade and of the efforts of
England	LOCATION	and our own country to come into possession of this far
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
Oregon	LOCATION	question on its diplo - matic side is treated in a brief but lucid fashion , the disputed noints being discussed as fully as could be expected in a popular narrative .

		After reviewing the efforts of the American pioneers and missionaries to establish , themselves on the
Columbia River	LOCATION	in the two decades following
1820	DATE	, the author gives us a vivid account of the ` great immigration ' that began about
1842	DATE	.

		To our knowledge of this movement Professor
Schafer	PERSON	has made some important contributions , his research having brought to light a number of hitherto unknown sources .

		When the authpr records the final settlement with
Great Britain	LOCATION	in
1846	DATE	, and the organization of a territorial gov - ernment at
Oregon City	LOCATION
three years later	DATE	, his purpose is accomplished ; but he has added several interesting chapters dealing with the political and material progress of the region since that date .

		The work makes a volume of about three hundred pages , and is provided with a number of excellent maps and suggestive illustrations .

		A reading of it leaves the impression that it is the work of one who knows his field and whose con - clusions may be relied upon .

		The author evidently believes that economy in style and accuracy in statement are virtues to be practised even when writing primarily for young readers .

		Having aired his prejudices the Emerald Isle , against the dwellers beyond the Tweed , Mr.
T. W. H. Crosland	PERSON	, author of ` The
Unspeakable Scot	PERSON	, ' now takes in hand his neighbors across St.
Greorge	PERSON	's Channel , in a companion volume which he entitles ` The Wild Irishman ' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		Between his out - spoken dislike of the Scotch and his patronizing and even contemptuous friendliness for the Irish , there is little to choose .

		Probably most Irishmen would prefer his honest enmity .

		Such chapters as those on ` Pigs , ' ` Potatoes , ' ` Dirt , ' ` Whisky , ' and ' Blarney , ' are not exactly calculated to make the natives of
Erin	PERSON	enthusiastic in the writer 's praise .

		As the utterance of a comparatively young man , the book lacks that degree of modest hesitancy and restraint so befitting an author gifted with considerably less than omniscience , but so seldom found except in union with really large attainments which might afford -- were that ever permissible to fallible mortals -- to be dog - matic .

		Of sweetness and light , of literary charm , even of careful writing and evidence of laborious endeavor to do one 's best and to polish one 's stanza , the book has little .

		A single short sen - tence , on Home Rule , will help to show in what key the work is pitched .

		We are told that ` any man who believes for one moment that it will be of the smallest benefit to
Ireland	LOCATION	is just a fool . '

		Perhaps the least praiseworthy feature of the volume is its frequent and uncalled-for slaps at the Scotch -- as if to illustrate anew that forgive - ness to the injured does belong , but they ne'er pardon who have done the wrong .

		For example , we read that ` he who drinks Scotch whisky be - comes as the Scotch people , who , as all men know , , are a hectoring , swaggering , dull-witted , bandy - legged , plantigrade folk ' and -- .

		But vituperation is already too much indulged in , without receiv - ing the encouragement of quotation .

		Two chap - ters of some literary interest the book does con - tain , on
Tom Moore	PERSON	and Mr.
W. B. Yeats	PERSON	.

		The tracing of Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	's so-called Celtic qual - ity to the influence of
Blake	PERSON	, who was not a Celt at all , furnishes good reading .

		An occasional Carlylism in Mr.
Crosland	PERSON	's pages is not unpleas - ing , except that the use of the adjunct instead of the possessive pronoun is hardly a graceful triek if often repeated .

		Colloquialisms abound ; nor is careless spelling absent , as ' empyricism , ' and ` practise ' as a noun -LRB- three times -RRB- ; nor are words always used in their accepted sense , as ` blarney of the vituperative order . '

		Among terms of little dignity or somewhat unusual may be noted ` jarvey , ' ` poteen , ' ` weeniest , ' and the verb ` ta keen . '

		Contemporary humorists are labelled groupwise as ' a sorry and indifferent company , * '' and a ` squad of awkward witlings . '

George Waldo	PERSON	-
Browne	PERSON	's ` The
St. Lawrence River	LOCATION	: Historical , .

		Legendary , Picturesque ' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- comes as one of a group of books on the great rivers of
North America	LOCATION	that already includes the Hudson and the
Colorado	LOCATION	, and is to include the
Connecticut	LOCATION	and probably the
Mississippi	LOCATION	.

		In the first two hundred of its three hundred and fifty pages , the author gives a sketch of the history of the
St. Lawrence	LOCATION	, -- which means in effect that of the French in
British North America	LOCATION	, since the great river was their highroad , and along its banks are the spots that mark the critical points of that his - tory .

		Mr.
Browne	PERSON	does not lay claim to actual original investigation , but he has read a goodly number of authorities , including original docu - ments , and has written a very acceptable brief history , although one could dispense with his somewhat patronizing attitude toward La Salle on page 148 .

		To those who are not familiar with the thrilling story of the French in
North Amer	LOCATION	- ica , this portion will be necessary for a thorough understanding of what follows ; those who are so - familiar will doubtless find it profitable to renew their knowledge .

		With Chapter XV .

		Mr.
Browne	PERSON	begins a trip up the river , starting with Tadousac at the mouth of the ` mysterious ' Saguenay , and giving a chapter to its picturesque charms and his - toric memories ; then upward , passing Riviere du Loup , Mun-ay Bay ,
Cartier	ORGANIZATION	's Isle of
Bacchus	LOCATION	, Ste.
Anne de Baupre	PERSON	of blessed memory and modern pilgrimages , and the beautiful falls of Montmor - ency , and finally reaching
Quebec	LOCATION	, to which two chapters are given , describing notable landmarks

		THE DIAL , 211 and relating connected facts and legends .

		The next chapter describes the Indian settlements and the peasant population , with its tj ` pes and festi - vals , then on past a ` region of rivers ' to
Montreal	LOCATION	, which the author calls
Canada	LOCATION	's `
White City	LOCATION	.

		* Here considerable space is devoted to the famous Chateau de Ramezay , that old-time relic which has been turned into a museum and portrait gal - lery , and in which alone one could make a consid - erable study of Canadian histoiy .

		The two re - maining chapters are devoted to climbing the rapids and the trip through the
Thousand Islands	ORGANIZATION	, with accompanying stories , true or legendary .

		To some readers , more physical description of the noble St.
Lawrence	PERSON	would be acceptable ; but within its lim - its the book is satisfactory ' , and a good map adds to its value .

		The volume is rather too large to accompany one 's travels ; but it might be read with advantage as a preliminary to a voyage , or afterwards for the pleasures of retrospect and the purpose of fixing one 's associations .

		Still , we would suggest a pocket edition that could find a place in the traveller 's suit-case .

		^ ^ , So far as a book of anecdotes may An anecdotal i _ ^ - i ^ ^ i - ^ retrospect .

		ser \ ' e as substitute for a live story - teller , the Hon.
Frederick Leveson Gower	PERSON	's ` Bygone Years ' -LRB- Button -RRB- admirably does this .

		With no manifest effort , no straining for effect , no attempt to raise a laugh , he suffers his pen to record such items of general human inter - est as have been picked up by him during a long life of contemplative observation rather than of strenuous action .

		Good humor , good sense , good birth and breeding , an entire absence of airs and pretensions , these are among the qualities that commend him to the reader .

		An apologetic pre - face intimates that it is more to the urgency of friends than to initiative on the writer 's part that we are indebted for these octogenarian gleanings .

		In a happily quoted couplet from
Moore	ORGANIZATION	, the firet line , ' I give thee all , I can no more , ' is mis - punctuated , the comma following ` can , ' to the ruin of the sense .

		Xow , in his eighty-sixth year , the author tells us he finds it hard to recall the main outlines of his life , although imimpoftant inci - dents remain in mind .

		Hence we are treated , not to history or biography , and luckily not to poli - tics , but to a variety of entertaining and never malevolent personalia and society anecdotes , to - gether with notes on
Spain	LOCATION	,
India	LOCATION	, and
Russia	LOCATION	, from journals of early travel .

		Though a barrister by profession , the author modestly doubts whether he ever could have earned his bread in his calling .

		His first instructor in the law neglected the in - tricacies of
Coke	ORGANIZATION	upon
Littleton	LOCATION	to listen to his pupil 's stories of society life ; which indicates that even as a youth he was no mean raconteur .

		But that society life is , after all , weariness and vanity , is illustrated by a reminiscence of the Princess
Lieven	PERSON	, who , always in the whirl of fashion , suf - fered from an intense boredom that almost amounted to a disease .

		If no one called of an afternoon , she would roll on the floor from tedium .

		Dreading to travel alone from CalaLs to
Paris	LOCATION	, she once offered a seat in her carriage to a chance clerg > Tnan , who , however , talked so inces - santly as fairly to drive her wild .

		Of
Ladv Hol	PERSON	- land and her set , some good stories are told .

		De - spite her despotic humor , young G'ower discemea her better qualities , and as seen through his eyes she is more amiable than one had imagined .

		To supplement the slender autobiographic informa - tion contained in the book , it may be worth while to note here some of the author 's family connec - tions .

		The first
Earl of Granville	PERSON	was his father , the second
Earl	PERSON	his brother .

		Lady
Georgiana Ful	PERSON	- lerton was his sister , and the sixth Duke of
Devon	LOCATION	- shire his maternal uncle .

		Of
Leveson	PERSON	and
Gower	PERSON	afiftnities and consanguinities , hyphenated and otherwise , the tale would be a long one .

		The au - thor was in
Parliament	LOCATION	almost continuously from
1847	DATE	to
1885	DATE	.

		Local history The number of books of local his - of an ancient tory in
England	LOCATION	is increasing as English town .

		interest in antiquarian lore is deepening and facilities for research are extend - ing .

		It is not usually the importance of the locality that influences its selection for historical treatment .

		Of many subjects of local histories the question might be asked , Why should anyone trouble to write a book about a place of which few have even heard ?

		But it is often in the most out-of-the-way place that the rarest his - torical treasures are preserved , and that succes - sive periods of growth are so well demonstrated as to illustrate the historical development of other like unimportant localities , which in the aergregate go a long way toward the making of
England	LOCATION	.

		This might be said of the ancient towiv of
Pickering	ORGANIZATION	in
Yorkshire	LOCATION	, which is little known even to English peoole .

		Stow states , on the author - ity of ` divers writers , ' that the town was built in the year 270 B. C , but evidence is not wanting that settlement was made on the site or in the neighborhood at an infinitely earlier period .

		Yet it preserves in its outward features and in its written records enough characteristics of the various phases of English geological , political , religious , and economic history , to illustrate ` The Evolution of an English Town , ' which is the title Mr.
Grordon Home	PERSON	gives to his story of
Pickering	ORGANIZATION	from pre-historic times up to the present year -LRB-
Dutton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		In going back to Palaeolithic and Pre-Glacial times , in tracing the changes that have taken place in the physical features of the locality in the Lesser Ice Age , in collating evi - dence of the occupation of the district by neoliths and men of the Bronze Age , and in the chapters on the various periods of historic times , the book furnishes a pleasing type of local history to which other essays in that field will do well to conform .

		But while
Pickering	PERSON	is thus made to serve as a typical English town , it has some very interest - ing individual characteristics , -- as , for example , its old church with curious paintings of about the middle of the fifteenth century upon the clere-story walls .

		Some of the folk-lore and folk - customs narrated are peculiar to the neighbor - hood , and these give to the book an interest far wider than that of the local antiquary .

		The illus - trations , interesting from an archaeolosrical stand - point , scarcely seem to justify the claim of the text that the vicinity of
Pickering	ORGANIZATION	is picturesque beyond the average of English sceneiy .

Oct. 1	DATE	, , ^ , ^ To those of us who , with
Steven	PERSON	- a schoolmaster , son , pray for the quiet mind , ` The
Upton Letters	ORGANIZATION	' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- by `
T.B.	PERSON	' are a help in that direction .

		Simple and nat - ural , sane and human , these reflective utterances on literary , moral , and educational themes , and on the commonplaces of daily life , have the charm that belongs to the genuine expression of a good mind and heart .

		They are the letters of a mas - ter in an English public school to a friend -LRB- ` Her - bert ' -RRB- sojourning in
Madeira	LOCATION	for his health ; and they run through the year
1904	DATE	, being brought to a close by the friend 's death .

		They are now pub - lished at the request of
Herbert	ORGANIZATION	's widow .

		Reality breathes in every line , and spontaneity animates every syllable .

		Personal reminiscence and anec - dote abound , A few lines indicating the writer 's admiration of
Newman	ORGANIZATION	's prose style are quotable , ' I have been going through
Newman	PERSON	's `` Apolo - gia '' for the twentieth time , ' he writes , ` and as usual have fallen completely under the magical spell of that incomparable style ; its perfect lucid - ity , showing the very shape of the thought within , its simplicity -LRB- not , in
Newman	PERSON	's case , I think , the result of labour , but of pure instinctive grace -RRB- , its appositeness , its dignity , its music .

		I oscillate between supreme contentment as a reader and envious despair as a writer ; it fills one 's mind up slowly and richly , as honey fills a vase from some gently tilted bowl .

		, , .

		I have no sympathy with the intellectual attitude it reveals , but as
Roderick Hudson	PERSON	says , I don ' t always heed the sense . '

		To be able thus to admire
Newman	PERSON	's art speaks something for the lettei ' - writer 's own powers as an artist in words .

		The little volume will create no sensation -LRB- heaven forbid ! -RRB-

		, but it will greatly content a choice few among the read - ers of books .

		New text-book of The enthusiasm of the translator the elements of for
M. Levasseur	PERSON	's ` Elements of political economy .

		Political Economy ' will hardly be shared by the student who attempts to use the book as a text , or by the advanced economist who tries to extract
M. Levasseur	PERSON	's theories of the science .

		Many leading economic questions are discussed with the clearness and comprehension which have given
M. Levasseur	PERSON	his acknowledged place among French teachers of political econ - omy .

		But the form of the book , and the sequence of subjects , are unfortunate .

		For example , much space is devoted to an interesting and enlighten - ing account of association in industry , the trade guilds of
Europe	LOCATION	, the modern trades unions , and the relation of both to the principle of freedom of contract ; but the usefulness of this review is nullified by its appearance in the chapter on ' The Production of Wealth , ' almost before mention is made of ` Distribution and Consumption . '

		In the same way , Rent , Interest , Socialism , Cooperation , and related subjects , are discussed in the chapter on Distribution , before the theories of Exchange and Consumption are explained .

		This lack of logical treatment renders
M. Levasseur	PERSON	's book almost incomprehensible to the beginner , for whom it is evidently intended .

		The essay was in the first instance drawn out by way of commentary -- hard - ly criticism -- on
Morley 's Life of Gladstone	ORGANIZATION	.

		Thus the principal interest for the reader , aside from his pleasure in the clear-cut style of the essay itself , will be in regard to those points in which Mr ,
Goldwin Smith	ORGANIZATION	differs from the biographer .

		Of these , the most important relates to Glad - stone 's Home Rule policy for
Ireland	LOCATION	; and upon it the author bases much of his criticism of
Gladstone	PERSON	's title to unerring statecraft .

		And while the words of neither the essayist nor Mv .

		The last three of these monographs are numbered among the results of the
Stanley McCormick Hopi	ORGANIZATION	expedi - tion .

		` Intentions ' is the title given to a volume of Essays by Oscar Wilde , just published by the Messrs.
Brentano	PERSON	.

		It comprises the following titles : ' The Decay of Lying , ' ` Pen , Pencil , and Poison , ' ` The Critic as Artist , ' and ' The Truth of Masks . '

		There is a frontispiece portrait of the author .

		To the '
Athenaeum Press Series ' of Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	we now have added a volume of ' Selected Essays of
Henry Fielding	ORGANIZATION	, ' edited by Mr.
Gordon HaU Gerould	PERSON	, and a volume of ` Selections from the Writings of
Joseph Addison	PERSON	, ' edited by Pro- fessor
Barrett Wendell	PERSON	and Mr.
Chester Noyes Greenough	PERSON	.

		` The Art and Craft of the Author ' is the title of a new handbook on literary work , by Mr.
C. E. Heisch	PERSON	, which is to be published during this au - tumn by Mr.
Elliot Stock	PERSON	of
London	LOCATION	.

		Its purpose will be to explain the principles which should guide the author , the objects he should keep in view , and the methods of carrying these out , rather than to supply a guide to the technicalities of literary work .

		The latest addition to Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	's series of ` Oxford Poets ' is a reprint of Mr.
Thomas Hut	PERSON	- chinson 's recent edition of
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	, now printed on smaller-sized paper and issued at a much lower price .

		Including as it does material never before printed in any edition of the poems , this is per - haps the most desirable edition of Shelley to be had , -- certainly it is the best moderate-priced edi - tion .

		Mr.
Charles Mosley	PERSON	, editor of * Nature Study ' , has arranged an edition of White 's '
Selborne	LOCATION	' for students , in which the whole of the Letters are classified under subjects , thus giving the reader un - der one head all that the naturalist wrote on each topic .

		As the subjects will be arranged alphabet - ically the work will be one of reference as well as for reading consecutively .

		Mr.
Elliot Stock	PERSON	of Lon - don is to publish the book during the coming season .

		In addition to their new '
Wessex	ORGANIZATION	' edition of Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	's novels , the Messrs.
Harper	PERSON	are preparing a thirty-volume
Dickens	PERSON	, fully illustrated with all of the old drawings .

		They also announce a new Shakespeare in eight volumes , illustrated in photo - gravure , and containing many special features , such as a full selection of the best annotations , an essay by
Cradock	PERSON	on the learning of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	's famous Introduction .

		The ` Fifty Piano Compositions ' by
Schumann	PERSON	that have been selected and edited by Mr.
Xaver Scharwenka	PERSON	make an important addition to the ` Musician 's
Library ' of Messrs. Oliver Ditson & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volume has the usual portrait , critical essay , and brief bibliography .

		Our only quarrel with the selection is that the ` Fantasia , op. 17 ' is represented by the first section only , and that but a single number is given from the ' Faschingschwank aus
Wien	PERSON	. '

		The
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	announces for pub - lication during the present season a collotype re - production , with introductions by Mr.
Sidney Lee	PERSON	, of the earliest editions of that portion of Shake - speare 's work which found no place in the
First Folio	ORGANIZATION	, namely : ` Pericles ' and the four volumes of Poems .

		The edition will be limited to one thou - sand copies .

		Among other works of marked lit - erary interest , the same firm have in press a col - lection of ` Critical Essavs of the Seventeenth Cen - tury , ' in three volumes , edited by Mr.
J. E. Spin	PERSON	- gam ; a three-volume edition of
Johnson	PERSON	's ` Lives of the Poets , ' edited by the late
G. Birkbeck	PERSON	Hill ; ` The Lyrical Poems of
Blake	ORGANIZATION	, ' edited by Mr.
John Sampson	PERSON	,
M.A.	LOCATION	; ` The Plays and Poems of
Eobert Greene	PERSON	, ' edited by Mr.
J. Churton Collins	PERSON	, in two volumes ; and the four concluding volumes in Mrs.
Paget Toynbee	PERSON	's elaborate edition of
Horace Wal	PERSON	- pole 's Letters .

		Mr.
Frederic Lawrence Knowles	PERSON	, one of the most promising of the younger American poets , died at his home near
Boston	LOCATION	on the
19th of last month	DATE	.

		Mr.
Knowles	PERSON	was bom in
Lawrence	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, in
1869	DATE	.

		After graduating from
Harvard	LOCATION	, in
1896	DATE	, he became associated with the literary departments of several prominent publishing firms of
Boston	LOCATION	, being at the time of his death literary adviser to
Messrs. Dana Estes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Knowles	PERSON	had written two volumes of verse , ` On Life 's Stairway , ' published in
1900	DATE	, and ` Love Triumphant , ' published a year ago .

		NOTES 245 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 246 THE GREEK LOVE OF DETAIL , The crocodile of the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	,
Herodotus	ORGANIZATION	tells ns in that admirable Second Book of his , has pig 's eyes , tusk-like teeth , and a dorsal armor of very strong scales ; he also adds that it is the only animal having no tongue and moving its upper instead of its under jaw , and that leeches infest its mouth , which it gladly opens for a certain bird resembling the plover to walk in and feast on the troublesome parasites -- a service so grate - ful to the hideous reptile that it holds ajar those huge jaws , which could easily make match - wood of a fishing boat , until the bird has walked out again unharmed .

		This vividly recalls tiie picture , in the old natural-history books , of a crocodile with its upper jaw , and in fact the whole cerebral region , tilted at an angle of nearly forty-five degrees with the lower jaw , which rests on the ground , while a small bird promenades the oral cavity -LRB- a veritable bonne hovche for the feathered feaster -RRB- with much apparent contentment .

		All these details are characteristic of the Greek historian 's inquiring and observing genius , but two of them also illustrate his occa - sional too ready acceptance of that which is curious and striking , and which , for the inter - est of his narrative , ought to be true if it is not .

		As for the leeches , and the bird which alone of animate beings is the ugly monster 's friend , and which
Herodotus	ORGANIZATION	calls the ' trochilos , ' later re - searches have proved the Halicamassian trav - eller to be in the right .

		The parasite -- * bdella ' is its Greek name -- has been identified with the ` timnatis nilotica , ' and the bird , which the Arabs of to-day call ' siksak , ' is inferred to be the ` pluvianus aegyptius . '

		But concerning the anomalous absence of a tongue and the excep - tional hinging of the jaws , the historian 's eyes deceived him .

		His account of the matter is very interesting , but unhappily not true .

		Mod - em naturalists have discovered a tongue to the animal , a thick fleshy growth , attached , as they tell us , very far back in the throat , and not so much in evidence as the unruly member of some higher forms of vertebrates .

		And the lower jaw , being prolonged backward beyond the skull , gives to the reptile 's yawn a generous ampli - tude , and in some way conveys the impression that the upper and less considerable blade of these enormous shears is the moving part .

		But exceptions only prove the rule , and the Ionic traveller 's fondness for graphic detail has 228 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, long been recognized as something far different from the ordinary sight-seer 's craving for nov - elty .

		No one will severely blame Herodotus for not pushing his study of saurian anatomy to a point that might have robbed us of his book be - fore the first page was written .

		He redeems his slight error of detail by going on to tell how the reptile is hunted , -- a curious method , sub - stantially the same as that still in vogue on the banks of the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	.

		Another small descriptive item in this Egyptian narrative chanced to ap - peal to the present writer with a certain vivid - ness and reality .

		In his account of the festival called the ` lighting of the lamps , ' periodically celebrated at Sais , and in fact throughout
Egypt	LOCATION	,
Herodotus	ORGANIZATION	says the lamps were filled with oil and salt , the wick floating on the sur - face and the lamps burning all night .

		The domestic column of a recent newspaper contains a paragraph advising housewives to put a little salt in their lamps to make them burn more brightly ; which goes to demonstrate again that there is nothing new under the sun .

		De Quincey once styled
Herodotus	ORGANIZATION	' the
Frois	PERSON	- sart of Antiquity , ' but later admitted that he had done the earlier writer an injustice ; for Froissart he declares to be ' little else than an historian , whereas
Herodotus	ORGANIZATION	is the counterpart of some ideal
Pandora	ORGANIZATION	, by the universality of his accomplishments . '

		And the English essay - ist proceeds to name some of the Greek histo - rian 's many excellences .

		His approximate accu - racy in giving dimensions and distances in
Egypt	LOCATION	, notwithstanding the crudeness of his in - struments of measurement , De Quincey consid - ers * all but marvellous ' ; and he warmly admires his description of that ancient land and its in - habitants .

		Judged as ' an exploratory traveller , ' he continues , in an essay that has not yet ceased to be good reading , ` and as a naturalist , who had to break ground for the earliest entrench - ments in these new functions of knowledge , we do not scruple to say that , mutatis mutandis and concessis concedendis ,
Herodotus	ORGANIZATION	has the separate qualifications of the two men whom we would select by preference as the most distin - guished among Christian traveller-naturalists ; he has the universality of the Prussian Hum - boldt , and he has the picturesque fidelity to na - ture of the English Dampier -- of whom the last was a simple self-educated seaman , but strong-minded by nature , austerely accurate through his moral reverence for truth , and zeal - ous in pursuit of knowledge , to an excess which raises him to a level with the noble Greek .

		Dam - pier , when in the last stage of exhaustion from a malignant dysentery , unable to stand upright , and surrounded by perils in a land of infidels , crawled on his hands and feet to verify some fact of natural history , under the blazing fore - noon of the tropics ; and
Herodotus	ORGANIZATION	, having no motive but his own inexhaustible thirst of knowledge , embarked on a separate voyage , fraught with hardships , toward a chance of clearing up what seemed a difficulty of some im - portance in deducing the religious mythology of his country . '

		To pass now to a Greek historian of the suc - ceeding generation and of another dialect , even the monotonous details of stages and parasangs that used to make
Xenophon	PERSON	's retreating Ten Thousand so tiresome a company of tired sol - diers to our schoolboy minds , may come back in later life as not unpleasing bits of realism , ac - ceptable for their very dulness , their rigid ad - herence to the hard facts of that stern struggle for a sight of the sea , with its cheering promise of home and friends .

		So , too , the Catalogue of Ships in the ' Iliad , ' a passage of 266 lines that used to be skipped in the classroom as not gram - matically instructive , contributes by its very monotony to complete one 's mental image of those primitive galleys hastening in squadrons across the ^ gaean and laden with warriors that are to do battle ' far on the ringing plains of windy Troy . '

		The description of the shield of Achilles is another bit of detail , tiresome prob - ably to the learner , but afterward recognized as a necessary part of the poem .

		As Professor
Butcher	PERSON	has well said , poetry was not for the Greeks , as it so often is for us , an escape from reality , a refuge from world-weariness ; and he quotes
Strabo	PERSON	's remark that ` to construct an empty teratology or tale of marvels on no basis of truth is not Homeric , ' and that in both ' Iliad ' and ' Odyssey ' we have a transference of actual events to the domain of poetry .

		A recent study of the ' Odyssey ' by a French scholar ,
M. Victor Berard	PERSON	, is said by the re - viewers to contain some curious and convincing illustrations of Homer 's accuracy as a geog - rapher and of his practical acquaintance with the navigation of the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	, with its islands and shores , its winds and currents , and with all the habits and customs of the seafaring folk that bordered its eastern waters .

		Even the farthest reaches of the hero 's wanderings cease not to be linked with reality .

		Mr.
Butcher	PERSON	quotes from the Frenchman 's work some strik - ing instances of the close agreement in the ' Odyssey ' between poetic fancy and prosaic reality of detail .

		In Book ii .

		11 .

		212 ff. ,
Tele	ORGANIZATION	- machus asks the suitors for a ship and twenty men , that he may go to
Sparta	LOCATION	and sandy
Pylus	PERSON	to inquire about his father .

		The request is re - fused ; but
Athene	LOCATION	, in Mentor 's guise , equips the expedition , and
Telemachus	PERSON	sets sail with Men - tor , the hour being approximately indicated by line 388 , ' The sun set , and shadowy grew all the ways , ' a formula occurring seven times in the
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 229 poem in connection with travel , and evidently demoting a late hour at night .

		Athene sent ' a favoring gale , a fresh wind from the northwest , singing over the wine-dark sea / and early next morning Pyliis is reached .

		If we consult the oflScial ' Sailing Directions ' of to-day , says Mr.
Butcher	PERSON	, we shall find that land and sea breezes alternate in those Greek waters , the wind from the sea beginning to blow each morning about ten o'clock and keeping all vessels in harbor the rest of the day , but subsiding at sunset , and followed , after some hours of calm , by the land breeze .

		Hence Telemaehus , leaving
Ithaca	LOCATION	about eleven at night , would have a favoring wind to waft him toward Pylus .

		The poet who described this voyage of Telemaehus had a ma - riners knowledge of that whereof he spake .

		Another example from the same source .

		Book V. 295-6 pictures a tempest encountered by Odysseus after he had left
Calypso	ORGANIZATION	's island and was approaching the Phaeacian coast : * Eurus and Notus clashed together , and stormy
Zephy	PERSON	- rus , and Boreas , bom in the bright air , rolling onward a great wave . '

		Of these four winds -- southeast , southwest , northwest , and northeast , respectively -- the last-named ,
Boreas	LOCATION	, finally prevailed , blowing continuously for two days and two nights , then falling and giving place to a ' windless calm ' on the
third morning	TIME	.

		Again consulting the ' Sailing Directions , ' we read , as quoted by Mr.
Butcher	PERSON	: ' It f requentlv happens that winds from the
N.E.	LOCATION	,
X.W.	LOCATION	, and S.E. blow at the same time in different parts of the
Adri	LOCATION	- atic .

		The wind called Bora is most to be feared and demands active and incessant watch ... .

		.

		In
summer	DATE	it never lasts more than three days .

		* Thus , we are assured by
M. Berard	PERSON	, the storm that overtook Odysseus was no mere storm of literature , but a genuine
Adriatic	LOCATION	tem - pest .

		While
Virgil	PERSON	's storms always rage three days , that is simply a part of his stock of poetic furniture .

		The author of the * Odyssey ' is minutely accurate in every detail ; and the dis - turbance of the elements as described by him off the Phaeacian coast furnishes an interesting bit of confirmation of the old tradition that
Phasacia	LOCATION	and the modern
Corfu	LOCATION	are one and the same .

		That Greek literature should be distinguished by clearness , precision , minute attention to de - tail , is of course no more than one would expect from what is known of tlie Greek character and of the environment that helped to produce it .

		Under those bright blue skies , vagueness and mysticism were not at home .

		An insatiate love of knowledge , of facts as they actually are , marked the Greeks .

		This love of knowledge , says
Plato	PERSON	in the Fourth Book of the * Eepublic , ' they had in as marked a degree as the
Phoeni	PERSON	- cians and Egv ` ptians had the love of money .

		To know was to the Greek mind an excellent thing , apart from all use , sordid or noble , of the knowl - edge acquired .

		One important department of learning , however , was strangely neglected .

		Eager as the people of
Greece	LOCATION	were to leam about distant lands and their inhabitants , they appear to have held it not worth while , or not in keeping with their national importance , to leam foreign languages .

		Herodotus in his travels evidently blundered along as best he could with only his mother-tongue in which to make known his wants and his queries .

		Like the unthinking and untaught person of our own time and countr -RCB- ' , the cultivated Greek seemed almost to assume without question that the words of his own language were the original and natural names of things .

		Epicurus , observes our authority already so freely quoted , felt no doubt , skeptical philosopher though he was , that the gods , if they spoke at all , spoke Greek ; and even so acute a mind as
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's fell a victim to fal - lacies that he would have easily avoided had he known the grammar of even one foreign tongue .

		But in one respect , and that a matter of lan - guage again , the love of detail and the striving for precision went so far as occasionally to try the patience of a modem reader of ancient Greek .

		The wealth and variety of modifying particles , designed to render impossible all de - fect in consecutiveness , to smooth over all ab - ruptness of transition , contribute at times to perplexity , or at least to irritation and weari - ness , rather than to perfect clearness .

		Pray , exclaims the much-enduring reader , can not a reasonable being draw an inference now and then without the ofl & cious assistance of an illa - tive conjunction , or of two or three of them marvellously welded together , with crasis and elision and various euphonic changes of con - sonants and vowels ?

		Yet over-scrupulous par - ticularity is better than slovenly ambiguity , and an infiinite capacity for taking pains than careless disregard of small things .

		The temptation is strong , even at the risk of perpetrating a few platitudes , to indulge in some closing reflections .

		A most excellent thing must one consider this Greek fondness for facts in all their details .

		There are times when the mind craves concrete realities large and small , as the raw material out of which mental tissue is formed , just as there are also moments when the longing is irresistible for the vague and mystical and dreamily suggestive .

		Preraphael - ism no less than impressionism , Greek clarity no less than Hindu mysticism , has its appointed hour .

		It is well at times to feel strongly con - vinced that knowledge is good for its own sake .

		Between knowing and not knowing , who could hesitate in his choice ?

		A plus is always in - finitely preferable to a zero or a mi nun .

		More - j280 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, over , if the business of our lives be not the quest of truth , in all edifying forms and in larger and larger measure , and its worthy exemplifica - tion in daily conduct , what then is it ?

		En - riched and fortified with large acquisitions of concrete facts and the ideal truths they symbol - ize , may not one meet the smiles and the frowns of fortune with like cKjuanimity ?

		Or , rather , to him wlio conforms himself to the facts can fortune wear any frowns ?

		What , after all , is man but the sum of all he has inherited and all he has experienced and learned ?

		And if he has but done his part toward making that sum total a considerable one , the better for him in the way of stability , virtue , contentment , useful - ness , and countless other respects too obvious to need naming .

		SHAKES FSAEIAN DRAMA
CHICAGO	LOCATION	.

		IN It is almost ten years since the writer of this article published in The Dial a record of i \ \ c Shakespearian performances at the
Chicago	LOCATION	theatres during a season wliich had appeared noteworthy for its classical productions .

		* In view of the charges of decadence so often urged against the contemporary stage , and the public taste for dramatic amusement , together with the alternating assertions -- on the one hand that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is no longer enjoyed and therefore seldom iierformed , on the other that such and such a season has been signalized by a revival of the classic drama beyond precedent , -- ^ in view of much discussion of these and kindred themes , it may be that a complete record of the Shakespearian plays produced in
Chicago	LOCATION	during the past ten years will have not only a passing interest , but prove of value i ?

		presenting facts bearing on the case .

		By way of furthei - comment , it may be said that while the

		THE DIAL , 231 It will be seen that the record opens with the advent of ^ Ir .

		Sdthem and
Miss Marlowe	PERSON	in an engagement of three weeks , during which they presented the three plays , ' Eomeo and
Juliet	PERSON	, ' ' Much Ado , ' and * Hamlet , ' giving seven per - formances of each play .

		It was not until the last of
January	DATE	that an opportunity was again given to see a Shakespearian drama on the Chi - cago stage ; but the week of
January	DATE	-
23	DATE	brought two stars into the field of vision , Mr.
Mansfield	PERSON	appearing for two weeks alternating in the roles of ' Eichard ' and ' Shylock , ' and Miss Rehan appearing for a single week in ' Taming of the Shrew . '

		Twelve performances of ' Romeo and
Juliet	PERSON	' by the
Bush Temple Stock Company	ORGANIZATION	are recorded in
February	DATE	, and wc had during that same month the production of the ^
Winter	DATE	's Tale ' by Mr.
Warde	PERSON	and
Miss Kidder	ORGANIZATION	.

		Yerv ' ajjpropriately ,
April	DATE	, the birth - month of the great dramatist , appears as the stellar month of the season .

		On
April 3	DATE	, Mr.
Ben Greet	PERSON	began his notable engagement , of which the first two weeks were devoted to six - teen presentations of seven Shakespearian plays ; these were ' Twelfth Xight , ' ' Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	, ' ' Two Gentlemen of
Verona	LOCATION	, ' ' Comedy of Errors , ' ' As You Like It , ' ' Much Ado , ' and ' Hamlet . ''

		On the seventeenth of the month came Miss
Viola Allen	PERSON	's appearance for sixteen performances in the ' Winters Tale . ''

		Meanwhile Mr.
Mantell	PERSON	, during the last week in
April	DATE	, was presenting his interpretation of •
Richard III	PERSON	. '

		Inasmuch as Mr.
Mantell	PERSON	's pro- ductions were given nine times in the week , we have for
the month of April	DATE	.


1905	DATE	.

		the note - worthy record of forty-one performances of nine Shakespearian pla ^ s ; except on
April 1	DATE	and on the first three
Sundays of the month	DATE	, there were presentations every day .

		Mr.
Maritell	PERSON	's engagement included a week 's appearances in ' Othello ' and another week 's in ' Hamlet . '

		In
May	DATE	, also , the
Bush Temple Company	ORGANIZATION	gave eleven performances of * As You Like It . '

		It should be added that in
March	DATE	^ liss
Blanche Bates	PERSON	twice included ' Katharine and
Petruchio	PERSON	' as one of the plays in a double bill .

		Xo account is here made of an open-air performance of ' As You Like It ' by Mr.
Greet	PERSON	's company in Sep - tember at tile
Onwentsia Club	ORGANIZATION	.

		The ' 133 per - formances of these twelve pla3 's certainly make the dramatic season of 1904-5 a very effective climax to this record of a decade .

		-- ' Midsummer Xight 's Dream ' and * The Tempest ' being included in this supple - mentary list .

		The writer does not care to pronounce any dicta upon the summary already given or upon that which follows .

		In the table appended , six down-town theatres are represented ; they average , perhaps , eight performances a week , and the length of the regular season is about forty weeks .

		A QUESTION OF ` EXEMPLARY MORALITY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of Thb DiAt . -RRB-

		In the issue of your journal for
Sept. 16 1	DATE	have read with some satisfaetiou the sympathetic no - tice of ` The Land of the Strenuous Life , ' by the Abbe
Klein	PERSON	.

		In the main , the criticism is gra - cious .

		The note of critical condescension , as might be exjjected , is not wanting .

		Into the notice there has crept a biting allu - sion that must cut eveiy Catholic reader to the quick .

		In no caiping spirit do I challenge the following innuendo : ` The exemplar > - morality , too , that he -LSB- the Abbe
Klein	PERSON	-RSB- delights to attrib - ute to the restraining influence of the confes - sional might not be borne witness to by police court records . '

		No words coidd conceal the virus here hidden .

		No such dart could be hurled hap - hazard .

		Let me ask the reviewer , Do the police - court clerks keep a register of such criminals as are regularly at confession ?

		Do they find on in - quir > - the fact that the confessional has failed 232 THE DIAI .

		-LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, of restraining them ?

		To what statistics did the reviewer have access in venturing the amazing opinion above quoted ?

		Is it another fulfilment of ' I do n't knoAv the man , but I 'd damn him at a venture ? '


Thomas Vincent Shannon	PERSON	.

		St.
Malachy 's Rectory	ORGANIZATION	,
Chicago	LOCATION	,
Oct. 5 , 1905	DATE	.

		-LSB- Father
Shannon	PERSON	's courteous letter of remon - strance and inquiry is of unusual interest to the reviewer ; for it is just such communications , coming so unexpectedly as they do , that are blessed to our use in enabling us in some small measure * to see oursel 's as ithers see us . '

		The ` virus ' which our correspondent so clearly de - tects must be present , in however diluted a form , else he could not have discovei'ed it ; and the only thing for the infected patient to do is thank - fully to appl -RCB- ' the anti-toxine furnished by the timely letter .

		And now the reviewer begs leave to ask in return whether , on re-reading the of - fending passage , the remonstrant would still con - sider his questions , concerning police-court regis - ters , quite as fair as they are diflScult to answer .

		For the sake of cleaniess , let us add a comma and change the form of the relative pronoun in the objectionable sentence , thus , -- ` The exemplary morality , too , -LSB- of the Catholics , -RSB- which he de - lights to attribute to the restraining influence of the confessional , might not be borne witness to by the police-court records . '

		It was the alleged superiority of Catholic over Protestant morals , and not at all the efficacy of confession , that the reviewer ventured to call in question ; and on this matter the police records might conceivably throw some light .

		Is it virulence in a critic to query whether those of a certain designated faith are morally superior to those of another ?

		In conclusion , it may interest Father
Shannon	PERSON	and other readers of The Dial to learn exactly what were the Abbe 's words that aroused this discus - sion .

		He says , speaking of the Catholic Church : ` By her sacraments , especially by confession , she combats intemperance , lust , and other vices , with a strength that the most beautiful discourses of Protestant ministei 's can never equal . '

		-- The Reviewer . -RSB-

		UNWORTETT READING FOR THE YOUNG .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		May the little flurry over the question of proper and impi'oper reading for the young be made the occasion for a word concerning one subtle but powerful influence in the undermining of public morality ?

		I refer to the influence of a class of ` literature ' not to be described as inflammatory , perhaps , but certainly as sensational ; not de - basing , but misleading ; powerful , because it de - votes genuine talent in narrative composition to the exposition of false ideals with an air of plausibility well calculated to deceive the reader of fair but untrained intelligence ; and danger - ous because it appeals primarily to readers too young and inexperienced to perceive and avoid the dangers of its quasi-teaching .

		The ` literature ' that I have especially in mind is in periodical form ; not the cheapest ` yellow ' kind , but that which appears in the garb of ap - parent i-espectabilitj ' .

		To be more particular , I have in mind as I wi-ite a magazine , several con - secutive numbers of which have recently by chance fallen into my hands , -- numbers contain - ing a ` college ' serial story .

		Now , there is no more attractive setting for a story for boys than that afforded by school or college life ; and there is none harder to handle with justice to subject , author , and reader .

		Report the life real - istically , and the story becomes a diy account of daily study and recitation , with an occasional plum of adventure .

		Make it all football and fun , and the picture is false ; every incident may have actually occurred to some person , but never could all of them fall within the range of one person 's experience .

		This story -- told graphically and in very decent English -- makes a course in college look like a four years ' cruise with a crew of pirate cut-throats .

		A group of college students are unconsciously involved in a miserable web of intrigue , includ - ing two mui-ders , one of them the mysterious stabbing !

		of a student on the campus .

		The presi - dent of the college acts as little like a college president as the police chief and the coroner do .

		The students mob the police , and at the coroner 's inquest two of them exchange knockdowns .

		The thing is untrue to college life -- untrue , happily , to any life .

		Yet it is done cleverly enough , -- with a cheap tinselled cleverness that makes it all the more dangerous .

		This magazine , and others like it , have a large circulation .

		Selling for a fairly high price , they of course go into homes where the thousands of boys who read them are of suffi - cient natural intelligence to make the most -- or the worst -- of their sensational suggestions .

		The latest issue to reach us of the ` The Pub - lishers ' Circular , ' which covers very eflaciently the affairs of the English book trade , is an ` Au - tumn Announcement Number , ' containing full par - ticulars of the forthcoming output of the English publishers .

		An absence of any scheme of classi - fication makes the information unavailable for quick reference ; but a casual glance through the list has revealed several items of considerable literary interest which do not appear in the an - nouncements of any of the American publishers .

		Among these may be mentioned a new collected edi - tion , in eight finely-printed volumes , of the com - plete works of

		THE DIAL C ^ t Jltfe go0hs .

		The Most Readable of the Anciexts .

		* A distinguished German philologist recently said that to find the l -RRB- est books of the past two decades one must consult not the
Leipzig	LOCATION	book - sellers ' catalogues but the reports of the excava - tions of the Eg -RCB- ptian Exploration societies .

		In a similar vein a pleased reviewer may hazard the paradox that the best English book of the year may well prove to be Mr. and Mrs.
Fow	PERSON	- ler 's most readable translation of the mo6t readable of the ancients ,
Lucian	PERSON	.

		The little Syrian barbarian , knocking about
Asia	LOCATION	minor in Median doublet , made of him - self by the assimilation of good literature not merely a Greekling but a Greek ; and verified again , five hundred years after it was uttered ,
Isocrates	PERSON	' boast that
Atticism	PERSON	is not a racial in - heritance , but a spiritual initiation .

		The average college graduate knows Lucian chiefly , if not solely , as the author of those lively and much imitated skits , the ' Dialogues of the Dead ' and the * ' Dialogues of the Gods . '

		But even the general reader may learn how much more he was , from no more recondite sources than Fronde 's '' ' Short Studies , '
Pater	PERSON	's ' Marius the Epicurean , ' Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's '' Letters to Dead Authors , '
Kenan	PERSON	's *
Marcus Aurelius	PERSON	, ' and , last but not least .

		Professor
Gildersleeve	PERSON	's witty character-sketch and the brilliant introduction to Miss
Emily James Smith	PERSON	's ' Selections . '

		Beginning as a perhaps briefless barrister and itinerant extension lecturer in the flamboyant conceited manner of the so-called new Sophistic or revived Atticism of the second century , his maturing taste gradually outgrew his tolerance of the pettiness of chicane and the trivialities of the schools .

		It amuses him to represent this process of growth as a conversion -- a putting away of his old mistress Rhetoric , who had raised him to affluence , and a taking up with a new saucy companion , Dialogus the son of Phi - losophy ; and commentators have taken his allu - sions to it as seriously as the coming
New Zea	LOCATION	- lander will take
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's account of the affecting circimistances attending his own conversion from
Philistinism	LOCATION	.

		Taking his motifs now from the wildest flights of Aristophanic imagination , now from the character studies and niceh * discriminated types of the new comedy , now from the racy prose and poetry jumble of the cynical Menip - pean satire ,
Lucian	PERSON	's lively genius compounded from these elements , and the prose of

		literary style thus artificially acquired that seems the native and natural expression of the writer 's thought , and not a mere pastiche .

		The classicism of his manner heightens by piquant contrast the effect of the realism of his matter .

		For , once master of his instrument of expres - sion , he employed it chiefly on the one theme in which originality was still possible for a Greek writer -- the portrayal and satire of the motley medley presented by the Greco-Koman empire at the culmination of its picturesqueness in the century that preceded its decline and faU .

		The opportunity for which
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	yearned and which Pater tried to recapture was his , and admirable was the use he made of it .

		It is from
Lucian	PERSON	that we really get to know the world of
Plutarch	ORGANIZATION	and Dio and
Marcus Aurelius	PERSON	, of
Herodes Atticus	PERSON	,
Aulus Gellius	PERSON	, and Fronto , of
Justin	PERSON	,
Minucius Felix	PERSON	,
Athenagoras	PERSON	and Celcus , of Apollonius of
Tyana	LOCATION	and
Alex	PERSON	- ander of Abonoteichos .

		The fume , the din , the opulence of the world 's capital , the splendors and miseries of the life of the Greek literary hanger-on in a great Roman house , the academ - ic peace and still air of delightful studies of
Athens	LOCATION	, the literary coteries , authors readings , and second-century clubs of every provincial centre of culture from
Ephesus	LOCATION	to
Pella	LOCATION	and
Marseilles	LOCATION	, the establishment of a new Zion and institute of divine healing in
Paphlagonia	LOCATION	, the misguided Christians who do not fear death be - cause they believe their souls immortal and are so easily duped because they esteem all men brothers , the philosophic side-shows and con - gresses of religion that fill the midway from Elis to the Olympic Games ; gorgeous dinners of the smart set at
Rome	LOCATION	, wedding suppers and banquets of philosophers terminating in the ex - tinction of the lights and the intervention of the watch ; a slanging match between an agnos - tic and a Stoic philosopher in the
Painted Porch	LOCATION	; Thessalian witches practising weird in - cantations on the unwary traveller in remote wayside inns ; fanatic fakirs purging this mortal dross by burning themselves alive in the pres - ence of gaping admirers ; great Roman dames setting out for their
summer	DATE	villas with ladies ' maids , curled dancing-masters , pet puppies and bearded Greek philosophers in their train ; the cynic in begging friars ' garb howling his con - tempt for the vanity of the world ; the stately Platonist Ion who sees further into the theory of ideas than any living man , and whose pres - ence in purple robe at a social function is as the Epiphany of a god , -- such are some of the scenes and tjpes portrayed in vivid panorama , a few of the facets of the ever-shifting kaleido - scope .

		Lucian , however , is more than an incompar - able show-master .

		He knows the inner
Intel	ORGANIZATION	- 234 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	; lectual and moral life of his time , can make every type of Greek and Roman , of philosopher , charlatan , visionary , professor and student , not only appear and speak , but think in character .

		And so it comes that he has a meaning if not a mes , sage for us .

		Tlie century which he depicts so vividly bears a startling resemblance to the age of Comtism ,
Monnonism	LOCATION	, Darwinism ,
Christian Science	ORGANIZATION	, and the religion of humanity , -- the age of the
Parliament of Religions	ORGANIZATION	and the Society for

		king .

		But the superposition of the
Pax Romana	LOCATION	and tlie white highways of the Roman legions on the crazy-quilt of nations , from the
Euphrates	LOCATION	to the Tyne , was a virtual equivalent in its effect on the imagination of the man in the street .

		Ilien , as now , a thin veneer of cosmopolitan culture imperfectly pro- tected an educated class ' dizzy with indiges - tion ' of unassimilated philosophic ?

		, from the infatuations of a populace distracted by the pretensions of nascent and moribund religions and bewildered by the conflicting traditions of juxtaposed but unmingling peoples .

		LAician 's types , of which he fully perceives the typical significance , are so astonishingly pertinent and Up to date that the interpreter lies under the suspicion of interpolating modem touches for effect .

		The rise of the religion of Alexander the false prophet -- of Abonoteichos , the conversation on Phantasms of the Living in the sick cham - ber of old Eucrates in which dignified profes - sors of philosophy vie with one another in the encouragement of the recrudescence of wonder , the epistle to an illiterate book-fancier , the ac - count of the career of the fakir
Peregrine	ORGANIZATION	, could easily be adapted with slight changes of local color to the latitude of
Chicago	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	,
Cambridge	LOCATION	, or
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		As offsets to all liucian 's wit and cleverness , it is customarv ' to urge the monotony of his ` everlasting no , ' the levity of his scepticism , the shallowness of the unsympathetic psychology that makes no allowance for the possible sincer - ity of Sludge the medium .

		Much could l -RRB- e said in defense or attenuation , did space permit .

		It is perfectly idle for men who ' do things , ' and not infrequently do them wrong , to attempt to suppress negative and satirical criticism , whether in
Lucian	LOCATION	,
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, or the
New York * Evening Post	ORGANIZATION	. '

		Construction and affirmation may be two-thirds or three-fourths of life , and may be the pleasanter task .

		But a good fraction remains for the indispensable business of obstruction , destruction , and nega - tion .

		Without it , hot-headed bunglers and cold - blooded speculators on the folly and weakness of humanity would have the world all their own way .

		A man i ?

		; not disposed of by the cavil that his work was essentially negative and de - structive .

		The question is , was the work well done ?

		Lucian 's genius and the conditions of his time called him to the task of negative satire .

		Sophocles was more fortunate , and was bom to a happier spiritual inheritance .

		But
Lucian	PERSON	acted magnificently his part , and there all the honor lies .

		As for his levity , if we ` clear our minds of cant ' -LRB- whether with small c or large K -RRB- we shall have to acknowledge that
Lucian	PERSON	's attitude more nearly resembles the habitual temper of the intellectual leaders of our own time than does the cosmic emotion and the pathological introspection of
Marcus Aurelius	PERSON	, which in their exalted moods they celebrate as the absolute re - ligion .

		The fact that the Hermotimus is emi - nently readable does not prevent it from being one of the most conclusive statements ever made of man 's incapacity for al -RRB- solute metaphysics .

		Lucian 's levity towards the Stoicism and
Pla	ORGANIZATION	- tonism of his time is precisely on a par with the ' shallowness ' of modern critics who refuse to take seriously the neo-Hegelian and neo-Kan - tian survivals and revivals of to-day .

		His super - ficiality is that of
Anatole France	LOCATION	, of LeMaitrc , of
Scherer	PERSON	, and of
Ronan	PERSON	, who justly pronounces him not only the most charming but the most solid intelligence of his age . '

		.

		Lucian is now definitively added to English literature , and the l ^ higlish reader may seek the decision of these controversies for himself , -- or , what is perhaps better , merely read him ' for human pleasure . '

		` fhc translation is admirably executed in the freer manner of
Jowett	ORGANIZATION	's Platte as opposed to the slightly archaic vocabulary and decalcomaniac fidelity of
Munro	PERSON	's Lucre - tius ,
Myers	PERSON	's Pindar , and
Lang	PERSON	,
Tjeaf	LOCATION	, and My - ers 's Iliad .

		The Greek periods are broken up into short crisp sentences .

		The fair general mean - ing rather than the precise verbal turn of the original is reproduced .

		And the whole reads as an English original rather than as a transla - tion .

		Whatever the hazards of this method in the case of
Plato	LOCATION	, where great issues may hinge on the precise connotation of a word , and a caprice of
Jowett	PERSON	's -RSB- -RRB- en create the legend of ' Plato 's golden rule , ' it is certainly the best way to render the delightful but slightly tauto - logous fluency of Lucian .

		In the application of it , the present translators are apparently guided by a nicer sense of the true values of the Greek than
Jowett	PERSON	possessed -- or exercised .

		In spite of the liberties they allow thomselva `` , it is rarely that a point is missed or a false note struck , idiom is rendered by idiom , proverb by proverb , and literary allusions , quotations , and technicalities of law , -RSB- > hilosophy , or art are neatly turned by apt analogues .

		* Whatever one 's individual judgment may be concerning Lord
Byron	PERSON	, there is no blinking the fact that no poet was ever in his own life - time so swiftly , so tremendously popular .

		And not only in his own countr -RCB- ' , but throughout the world : for the first time an English poet attracted a contemporarv European audience , for the first time
France	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	recognized the literature of
England	LOCATION	.

		But also there is no blinking the other fact that when the centenary of this idol of his times came around -LRB- 1888 -RRB- his reputation had faded to such a degree that scarcely any note was taken of it , and his poetry seemed to have sunk into that ' half - life ' which , in sincerity or not , he had himself prophesied for it .

		The Day of Judgment set by
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	has now come , yet who recognizes the fulfillment of the critic 's prophesy : * When the year
1900	DATE	is turned , and our nation comes to recall her poetic glories in the centurj - which has then just ended , the first names with her will be these --
Wordsworth	PERSON	and
Byron	PERSON	. '

		From time to time , indeed , a Byron revival has seemed imminent , and even has been loudly proclaimed .

		It was looked for last year , with the completion of
John Murray	PERSON	's definitive edition in tliirteen volumes , which had been several years in the making ; while at the same time the late
W. E. Henley	PERSON	was preparing a rival edition for Mr.
Heinemann	PERSON	.

		There has just been published a complete edition of
Byron	PERSON	's poems and dramas in the scholarly '
Cambridge	LOCATION	' series edited by Mr.
Bliss Perry	PERSON	; and now we have a book called ' Confessions of
• Tee Cokfkssioxs of Lord Btrox	ORGANIZATION	.

		Arranged by
W. A. Lewis Bettany	PERSON	.


London	LOCATION	:
John Murray	PERSON	.

		Imported by
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons ,
New York	LOCATION	.

		Lord
Byron	PERSON	, ' containing no new matter , but consisting of classified excerpt * from his letters and journals , taken from the volimiinous Mur - ray edition .

		Although it can not be said that any or all of these books have created the expected * Byron revival , ' yet they do furnish the ma - terial for a better understanding of a ver -RCB- ' contradictoi-y character as a man , and incident - ally some explanation of the vicissitudes of his reputation as a poet .

		The editor of these ' Con - fessions ' is Mr.
W. A. Lewis Bettany	PERSON	.

		The fact that he has previously edited in similar fashion the ` Table-Talk ' of Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	plainly serves to account for the somewhat surprising subject of his introduction , ' On
Byron	PERSON	's Obligation to
Johnson	PERSON	' -- an obliga - tion which , after all , is too casual to receive the prominence here given to it .

		The selections are classified imder six heads , and deal with
Byron	PERSON	's reflections on himself , on contempor - ary English poet `` , on his friends : also with his religious views , his opinions concerning the drama , and the literary life in general .

		Ar - ranged chronologically , and covering a period of over twenty years , they serve also to show the changes of mental attitude which the prog - ress of the years developed in
Byron	LOCATION	, as they do in all men of thought and experience .

		Alas that these revelations of his most intimate opinions estrange rather than endear us to the man !

		Gladly would we feel toward
Byron	PERSON	as we do toward
Shelley	PERSON	,
Scott	PERSON	, and
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	, and love the man even as we admire the poet .

		On the contrary , we are impressed by his essential unlovableness .

		Before he had reached the age of twenty , he wrote : ` Nature stampt me in the Die of Indifference .

		I consider myself as destined never to be happy , although in some instances fortunate .

		I am an iso - lated Being on the
Earth	LOCATION	, without a Tic to attach me to life , except a few School-feUows , and a score of females .

		Let me but * ` hear my fame on the winds , '' and the song of the Bards in my Nor - man house , I ask no more , and do n't expect so much .

		Of Religion I know nothing , at least in its favour .

		We have fools in all sects and Imposters in most ... I am surrounded here by parsons and methodists , but , as you will see , not infected with the mania .

		I have lived a Deist ; what I shall die I know not ; however , come what may , ridens moriar .

		* That
Byron	PERSON	had a most injudicious mother , is beyond question ; that her ungovernable tem - per , cruel taunts , and unsympathetic attitude toward the physical deformity of her brilliant olffspring , embittered his whole life is also doubtless true .

		Yet withal she had a fierce and spasmodic affection for him which .

		ought to have shielded her from his habitual refer - ence to her as ' Clytemnestra , ' or from such a letter as this , written after months of separa - tion and from a far-distant land : 236 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, ' I trust you like
Newstead	PERSON	and agree with your neighbors ; but you know you are a vixen -- is not that a dutiful appellation ?

		Pray , take care of my books and several boxes of papers in the hands of
Joseph	LOCATION	; and pray leave me a few bottles of cham - pagne to drink , for I am very thirsty ; -- but I do not insist on the last article without you like it .

		I suppose you have your house full of silly women , prating scandalous things . '

		The only relative that
Byrou	PERSON	ever really loved was his half-sister
Augusta	LOCATION	.

		In his letters to her , or in the journal which he kept for her during his foreign travels , he is to be seen at his gentlest and best , although seldom even there free from his gloomy and continual self-consciousness .

		After a tour of thirteen days among the Swiss Alps , he writes : ' I am a lover of Nature and an admirer of Beauty .

		I can bear fatigue and welcome priva - tion , and have seen some of the noblest views in the world .

		But in all this -- the recollections of bitterness , and more especially of recent and more home desolation which must accompany me through life , have preyed upon me here ; and neither the music of the
Shepherd	ORGANIZATION	, the crashing of the Ava - lanche , nor the torrent , the mountain , the Glacier , the Forest , nor the Cloud have for one moment lightened the weight upon my heart , nor enabled me to lose my own wretched identity in the majesty , and the power and the Glory , around above and be - neath me , I am past reproaches ; and there is a time for all things To you , dearest Augusta I send and for you I have kept this record of what I have seen and felt .

		Love me , as you are beloved by me . '

		Another fact which must always weigh against
Byron	PERSON	is his falseness .

		He was abso - lutely without loyalty , either in love or friend - ship .

		Professing great attachment to
Shelley	LOCATION	, he yet listened to damaging stories which he knew to be untrue and then failed to fulfill his promise to exhibit the evidence which would have fully exculpated the accused .

		Byron , and
Byron	PERSON	only , had it in his power to reverse one of the most cruel of all charges against
Shel	PERSON	- ley ; yet the letter which would have accomp - lished this , which he had promised to deliver and was under every obligation of honor to deliver , was found still among his papers after his death .

		He was false also to
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	in the matter of ' The Liberal , ' although later he made some show of generosity .

		The ^ Confessions ' show other , though less flag - rant instances ; in one letter there is an acknowledgement of liis own limitations in loyalty .

		` As to friendship , it is a propensity in which my genius is very limited .

		I do not know the male human being , except
Lord Clare	PERSON	, the friend of my infancy , for whom I feel anything that deserves the name .

		All of my others are men-of-the-world friend - ships .

		I did not feel it even for
Shelley	PERSON	, however much I admired and esteemed him ; so that you see not even vanity could bribe me into it , for , of all men ,
Shelley	PERSON	thought highest of my talents , -- and perhaps of my disposition . '

		Byron 's delight in posing , in giving a theat - rical air to everything he said or did , cap - tivated his contemporaries .

		It threw a certain glamour over his personality , which shows up a bit dingy under our modern electric light .

		He loves to tell that his '
Lara	PERSON	' was written ' while undressing after coming home from balls and masquerades in the year of revelry
1814	DATE	' ; he protested that he liked Iwing ro - mances better than writing them , and that he preferred the society of gentlemen to that of literary men ; he indulged in alternate absti - nence and voracity in the use of food and drink ; he professed an indifference verging on hostility to some things which , commonly de - light mankind , such as music and pictures .

		Of his love affairs he is never tired of making scenes and sensations .

		Writing in maturity of his first love affair -LRB- at the age of eight -RRB- he says : ` My misery , my love for that girl , were so vio - lent that I sometimes doubt if I have ever been really attached since .

		Be that as it may , hearing of her marriage several years after was like a thunder-stroke -- it nearly choked me -- to the horror of my mother and the astonishment and al - most incredulity of everybody . '

		His first dash into poetry was with his sec - ond love-affair -- at the age of twelve .

		On the principal question , why
Byron	PERSON	's poetry fails to please to-day as it pleased our grandfathers and grandmothers , we da not get much light , nor could it be expected , from this book of ' Confessions . '

		The answer is to be sought rather in a consideration of a some - what new demand now made upon poetry , as a revelation of truth and a spiritual and moral insight .

		But on the secondary question , why even when admired as poet he is still not be - loved as man , there is much illumination .

		The answer is , -- because he was personally self - absorbed and untender , because he was false as a friend , and because the theatrical air which was so taking in his time now fails to charm a more practical and more cynical age .

1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 887 seem incomplete .

		Professor
Greene	PERSON	's '
Provin	PERSON	- cial
America	LOCATION	/ for example , tells us of the first two wars between
France	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	; while
King George	PERSON	's War and the French and Indian War form the theme of '
France	LOCATION	in
America	LOCATION	/ by Dr.
R. G. Thwaites	PERSON	.

		The division has been skilfully accomplished ; and repetition , which might have marred the endeavor , has been re - duced to the lowest terms .

		As we have suggested , that which most of all connects the two books is the theme of militar -RRB- ' and political history .

		We have long since ceased to look upon these wars between the French and the English as separate un - related events , or as merely a part of American history .

		Instead , we recognize in them but phases of a world-struggle between the two great civilizations of
Western Europe	LOCATION	, between
Boman Catholic France and Protestant Eng	ORGANIZATION	- land .

		Sir
John Seeley	PERSON	has shown us that the preparation for them begins not with
Louis XIV	ORGANIZATION	.

		and
William III.	PERSON	, but with Queen
Eliza	PERSON	- beth and
Oliver Cromwell	PERSON	-- monarchs who made the self-reliant , unattached , Protestant , maritime , commercial
England	LOCATION	.

		Henceforth , then , we demand that whoever shall write of these events shall do so in a large spirit , with something of the dash and vigor of the events themselves .

		This may be said of Professor
Greene	PERSON	's account ; but more especially is it true of Professor
Thwaites	PERSON	's , as he recounts to us the thrillincr story of the Siege of
Louis	LOCATION	- burg , of
Washington	LOCATION	's expedition to the
Ohio	LOCATION	countrj ' , of
Braddoclr	ORGANIZATION	's failure , and , finally , of the duel between
Montcalm	LOCATION	and
Wolfe	PERSON	.

		When we turn from the tie of military liis - tory which binds these books together , to the characteristics which give to each its individu - ality , our task becomes harder .

		By far the larger part of ' Provincial America ' deals not with war , but with the constitutional and social history of the Colonies in
the first half of the eighteenth century	DATE	.

		Thus we have a continuation of Professor
Andrews	PERSON	's * Colonial Self-government . '

		But there is this difference between the problems which faced Professor
Andrews	PERSON	and these which Professor
Greene	PERSON	has met : the earlier period is one which has been worked over and over .

		Doyle , for example , carried his work through the seventeenth cen - tur -RCB- - ; and so , in a different way , did
John Fiske	PERSON	.

		The Revolutionary period , likewise , has been well handled ; but the interval which > eparates
this from the seventeenth century	DATE	has by many writers been slurred over .

		Mono - graphs have been written in great numbers -- though even more are needed , we think -- ^ but there has been a distinct lack of some con - structive work to organize this scattered infor - mation .

		This labor Professor
Greene	PERSON	has at - tempted ; and , anticipating criticism by his re - mark that * It is hardly possible even now to write a history which can be called in any sense definitive ; certainly no such claim is made for the present work / he has given us a helpful and suggestive book .

		The opening chapter presents a very satis - factory resume of the conditions at the time of the Revolution of
1689	DATE	; with due attention to the racial elements , religious differences , and economic occupations which made up American life .

		In contrast with the older policy , which was to leave to private hands responsibility for both CMJonomic and governmental administra - tion , and to permit a larger number of small governments with little or no parliamentary control , the new policy in the latter days of the Stuarts was to substitute royal provinces for parliamentary , and where possible for the elective or corporate system ; to consolidate wherever occasion offered , and to deny repre - sentation to the inhabitants .

		The Great Revo - lution in
England	LOCATION	and the subsequent disturb - ances in
America	LOCATION	, together with the outbreak of war with
France	LOCATION	, led to a compromise by which representation was everywhere allowed , and consolidation was reduced to the union of several colonies under the same governor .

		The change from the other forms to the royal prov - ince was , however , put into effect by the new government , so that by
1691	DATE	no less than five of the twelve colonies had ` heen modelled after this type .

		The dissatisfaction of all concerned with the ensuing state of things led to further regu - lation by the government , and now , more especially by
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Navigation Act of
1696	DATE	and other legislation resulted .

		This l ^ islation was not limited merely to commerce , but included the Piracy Act of
1700	DATE	, the Cur - rency Act of
1707	DATE	, and the Post Office Act of
1710	DATE	.

		Moreover , besides this lawmaking , ihe organs of administration were improved by the establishment of the
New Board of Trade	ORGANIZATION	, by increasing the supervision of colonial legisla - tion , by strengthening judicial control , by in - sisting on the right of appeal to the
Privy Council	ORGANIZATION	in
England	LOCATION	, and finally by direct at - tack on the colonial charters .

		On the other hand , colonial dissatisfaction expressed itself in vigorous resistance , and resulted in the sub - stitution of a uniformity in the opposition of colonial assemblies to the governors which was entirely lacking in the earlier period .

		In - fluenced by the course of politics abroad , pay - ing close regard to such acts as the Habeas Corpus and the Toleration Act , always willing to learn a lesson from the now nearly autono - mous corporations to the
East	LOCATION	, all the English colonies , no matter what their form , tended toward constitutional government and democ - racy .

		238 THE DIAI .

		-LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, Following this is an interesting and fair - minded chapter upon the ecclesiastical relations between Puritans and Anglicans , 1689-1714 , Next come the chapters on the French wars , to which reference was made above .

		As these possess less distinction than the otlier parts of the work , we proceed at once to the latter half of the book , in which are discussed imperial policy and administration to
1743	DATE	and provin - cial politics throughout the same period , pro- vincial leaders , immigration and expansion , the founding of
Georgia	LOCATION	, and provincial industry , commerce , and culture .

		In this part of the work the results seem to us less satisfactory .

		Undoubtedly this is due in large measure to the necessity for compres - sion and to the confused nature of the events and circumstances which are chronicled .

		But we feel also that Professor
Greene	PERSON	does not show that intimate acquaintance with the sources which is evident in his treatment of the earlier period .

		Did space permit , this criticism might be elaborated at length ; but we are forced to mention only a ver -RCB- ' ^ few points .

		First , there is no satisfactory reference to the constitutional experiences of any other English colonies than those on the coast : whereas much may be learned , by comparison , from the his - tory of
Jainaica	LOCATION	, for example .

		The handling of internal affairs in
New England	LOCATION	seems some - what disjointed ; and the picture of New Eng - land life and thought is not as clear as one would like .

		No one could gather from Profes - sor
Greene	PERSON	's account an accurate idea of the circumstances which preceded the Great Awak - ening -LRB- p. 321 -RRB- .

		Again , though this relates to the earlier chapters , the account of politics in
Pennsyl	LOCATION	- vania leaves practically untouched the inter - esting constitutional experiments of that col - ony , and does not mention the formation in
1702	DATE	, by the lower countries on the
Delaware	LOCATION	, of a separate assembly .

		In the southern colo - nies where the colonial archives remain largely unprinted , Professor
Greene	PERSON	's treatment is still less satisfactory .

		In
Maryland	LOCATION	, notwithstand - ing Dr.
Steiner	PERSON	's exhaustive monograph , we have ' no adequate account of the restoration of the
Proprietary Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		Nothing is said about the influence of German immigration into this colony , although it was very largely this which drew
Maryland	LOCATION	away from the southern colonies and made her a farming as well as a planting state .

		Reference is made to the improvement of tobacco in
Maryland	LOCATION	by the inspection law of
1747	DATE	, but nothing is said of the similar conditions in
Virginia	LOCATION	or of the inspection laws beginning in
1730	DATE	which served as a model to the Marylanders .

		Finally , the interesting connection between this legislation and the mercantile system of
Great Britain	LOCATION	is left entirely unclear .

		These seem to us to constitute some weak - nesses in the latter part of ' Provincial Amer - ica . '

		On the other hand .

		Professor
Greene	PERSON	has given us an excellent sketch of
Georgia	LOCATION	, has described satisfactorily
Walpole	LOCATION	's regime and the Molasses Act , has recognized the indi - viduality of some colonial leadere whose names usually have been allowed to pass unnoticed , and , above all , has blazed the way into a difficiilt field , making it rhuch easier for future writers to follow liim .

		Surely , we owe hi in thanks .

		While Professor
Greene	PERSON	has dealt with a limited period of time and a widely scattered number of topics .

		Dr.
Thwaites	PERSON	's work covers nearly three centuries and has a unity deter - mined by the events themselves .

		Facile prin - ceps among the American writers of this gen - eration who have made the French colonization of
America	LOCATION	their field of study .

		Dr.
Thwaites	PERSON	in this volimie sums up the results of many years devoted to the special investigation of his subject .

		Again in contrast with the deartli of constructive work iipon
English America	LOCATION	, the twelve volumes of Parkman have told the story of
New France	LOCATION	, and the magni nom - inis umbra still abides .

		But many years have passed since
Parkman	PERSON	wrote , and it is , indeed , well to have Professor
Thwaites	PERSON	re - capitulate the results of recent criticism and fresher scholarship .

		As we have suggested at the beginning of this review , the struggles known as
King George	ORGANIZATION	's War and the French and Indian War form the central theme of this volume .

		These ten chapters make up more than half the book , and constitute an account of this famous duel which will not soon be superseded .

		There is appended a short chapter upon Spanish rule in
Louisiana	LOCATION	, from
1762	DATE	to
1803	DATE	.

		Thus barely one hundred pages are left for the whole period before
1740	DATE	.

		The author begins at the very Ijeginning , and describes to us the processes which built up
New France	LOCATION	, the Acadian frontier , and
Louisiana	LOCATION	.

		This story of foun - dations is unfortunately compressed , and much detail -- we might say almost all detail -- is omitted .

		The narrative of
Coligny	ORGANIZATION	's attempts at colonization in the South is dismissed in a few lines , aiid one has to turn back to Pro- fessor
Bourne	PERSON	' 3 `
Spain	LOCATION	in
America	LOCATION	' for the full account .

		The structure of the trading - companies is scantily treated .

		The name of
Colbert	PERSON	does not appear in the Index , nor an account of his nursing of
Canada	LOCATION	, between
1664	DATE	and
1683	DATE	, in the text .

		Again , hardly enough is said of the settlement and develop -
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 239 ment of the French West Indies .

		On the other hand , a spirited narrative describes the exploits of La Salle and Tont -RCB- ' , of
Iberville	LOCATION	and Bien - ville .

		We are made to see how Fleuri and
Walpole	LOCATION	both wished peace but were driven to war by the Spanish interest , how Yemon failed at
Cartagena	LOCATION	, and how Anson won a brilliant name by his exploits in the
Pacific	LOCATION	.

		We then come again to the war period , and by the comparison are led once more to wish that Dr.
Thwaites	PERSON	had been able to give as full treatment to the earlier part of his work .

		In closing , we wish to lay special emphasis upon two excellent characteristics of this work .

		The first is the wealth of geographical knowl - edge which is exhibited both in the text and in the excellent maps .

		The second is the spirit of wise , imprejudiced sympathy which pervades the work , and which is nowhere better dis - played than in the chapter on ' The People of
Xew France	LOCATION	. '

		Here , sharply criticising the mis - taken autocratic rule of
France	LOCATION	, through gov - ernor , intendant , and bishop , the lack of any self government , and the reign of graft which corrupted the whole oflBcial system .

		Dr.
Thwaites	PERSON	stops to pay a merited tribute to the clergy , the Jesuits , Recollects , Sulpicians , and
Capuchiens	PERSON	.

		` It is not necessary to be a Catholic , nor is it essential that from the standpoint of the twentieth eentur -RCB- - we should endorse the wisdom of its every act in the eighteenth , most profoundly to admire the wM-k of the
Church of Bome	ORGANIZATION	both among whites and savages in

		Ivory Carvixgs ,

		* Although the ivory carvings which have come down to our day from ancient times have en - gaged the attention of numerous critics and archaeologists for more than two centuries , the voluminous literature which has grown up about them Ls for the most part made up of monographs on special objects , or classes of objects , and critical papers concerning them .

		The fijst compendious account in any lan - guage of the progress of ivory carving throughout the world 's history ' is furnished by Mr.
Alfred Maskell	PERSON	in his treatise on * fvories , ' published in the ' Connoisseur 's Library , ' a series of art books now appearing • Ivories .

		By
Alfred Maskell	PERSON	,
F.S.A. Illustrated	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LRB- The Connoisseur 's Library . -RRB-

		Xew York :
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		under the general editorship of Mr.
Cyril Davenport	PERSON	of the British Museum , A high standard of excellenc-e is set in this book : it can - not fail to take rank at once as the authoritative work upon the subject of which it treats .

		The field covered by Mr ,
Maskell	PERSON	is a wide one , -- too wide , in fact , to be treated with equal thoroughness throughout by any one per - son .

		Nevertheless , the shortcomings of his book are surprisingly few , and are trivial when weighed against the very obvious merits .

		Aside fnHn a few points that are open to difference of opinion , the chief thing that might perhaps be criticised is the scope of the work itself .

		Such criticism , however , is disarmed by the pain < which the author has taken to obviate , as far as he might , the tendency to incompleteness of view arising from the limitation of his theme .

		Considering the closeness of the relation of art - work in ivory to other branches of gljrptic art , -- if , indeed , mere difference in material -LRB- as , for example , that between ivory and wood -RRB- can be said to constitute a separate branch , -- a treatise devoted exclusively to ivories would of necessity seem to involve a partial and insuffi - cient presentation of the subject .

		Nor does the difficulty end here .

		True connwsseurship calls for comprehensive knowledge , including in its purview all things whatsoever which in any way throw light upon the objects under considCTa - tion .

		This appears to be well understood by Mr.
Maskell	PERSON	, as his frequent references to cog - nate works in various fields attest .

		The man - agement of this side of his topic was not the least difficult part of his task .

		Manifestly , ho could touch but cursorily upon anything lying outside his immediate subject ; else not one volume , but many volumes , wo ^ ild have been required .

		What was necessary was to indicate sufficiently that his survey is inclusive , and that the opinions expressed rest upon a far wider foundation than the study , however intimate , of ivories alone , or even chiefly , c-ould give .

		For ivory carving is only a phase ; it is not a thing of itself apart .

		It does not even call for much teclinical knowledge not possessed by the car - vers of other materials .

		Yet , partly as the rer suit of chance , it occupies a place of importance in the history of art , of which , in a way , it furnishes a sort of epitome : alm -LRB- '' t the only existing remains of European art work during some of the early centuries of the Christian era being ivory sculptures .

		It is but natural that the authors predilec - tion for ivories should lead him to hold a somcr what exaggerated notion of their intrinsic beauty . '

		Ivors * would seem to be a medium . ''

		he says , ' in which the refined taste of the great sculptors of
Greece	LOCATION	must have delighted . '

		Dct spite the use of ivory in chryselephantine 240 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, statues by Phidias and Praxiteles , of which history speaks , this statement can be accepted in a limited sense only .

		That ivory is a beautiful substance , caiinot be gainsaid ; yet artists and art-lovers capable of appreciating the finer qualities in works of art find it as a material too pretty .

		It lends itself to delicacy and refine - ment of a certain sort , but not readily to the dignity and strength that noble works must have .

		That the Greek sculptors should have failed to perceive this , is beyond the bounds of probability .

		By the Japanese , the essential weakness of works carved from ivoiy is well understood .

		Neither vigor of conception nor tour de force in execution can quite do away with the prettiness .

		Effects far more bold and nigged can be got from wood .

		The ease with which minute detail can be carved in ivory is also a pitfall .

		And so , in spite of their unde - niable beauty , the works of the post-renaissance ivory sculptors , with rare exceptions , fail to yield quite the same degree of aesthetic pleasure as do the comparatively crude and naive per - formances of their fellow-craftsmen of the dark ages .

		No doubt , much of the cachet of the earlier works is due to a finer and truer sense of composition ; but apart from this , their direct - ness and simplicity give them a distinction rarely achieved by the more elaborate works of modern times .

		The book opens with an interesting and in - structive introductory chapter .

		This is fol - lowed by one on prehistoric ivories .

		Here the author , in his desire to be comprehensive , strays , it would seem , somewhat beyond bounds , and into a field that he has not thoroughly explored .

		The pieces of bone with drawings upon them , said to have been found in ancient cave-dwell - ings , may perhaps be classed as ivories , but not as ivory sculptures .

		As to the piece of a rein - deer 's antler carved to represent the head and shoulders of an ibex , which is figured on plate I , it is so far beyond any well attested accomp - lishment of barbaric man that it is impossible not to wonder at the author 's credulity in ac - cepting it as genuine ; more especially as he refers , further on , to the fact that * there has been a not inconsiderable output of spurious things of the kind which profess to have been discovered ... in the caves of the Dor - dogne , ' to which locality this piece is attributed .

		The author is on surer ground in the next chap - ter , which deals with ivories from the ruins of
Nineveh	LOCATION	and from ancient
Egypt	LOCATION	.

		Many of these have been so changed in their outward appearance as to be unrecognizable as ivory by the untrained observer .

		Some pieces , we are told , ^ are hardly to be distinguished from ebony ; others resemble basalt , slate , fossilized wood , sandstone , wax , or even possess almost the iridescence of opal . '

		Still others resemble turquoise so closely as to require a chemical test to determine their true character .

		Each of the nineteen chapters of this book might well claim the attention of the reviewer were space available for such extended com - ment .

		One of the most important is that de - voted to the so-called consular diptychs .

		When formed of two leaves , the wax-covered writing - tablets in common use in
Europe	LOCATION	until modern times were termed diptychs .

		The back of each leaf was ' slightly hollowed out , leaving a raised margin to hold a very thin layer of wax , the surface of which was colored , usually black or green , so that the letters scratched upon it with the metallic style might appear white and be easily legible . '

		For several centuries such tab - lets specially made to order from the finest ivory obtainable , and often elaborately carved and sometimes otherwise embellished , were fre - quently used by the Roman Consuls , upon their accession to that exalted rank , for presentation to other liigh dignitaries .

		The few leaves of these consular diptychs that have survived until our day are all in public collections , where they are highly treasured .

		In what he has to say about these and the closely-related earl > ' Christian and Byzantine ivories , as also about reliquaries , crucifixes , pastoral staves , bishops chairs , and other ecclesiastical accessories , Mr.
Maskell	PERSON	writes with the authority of a scholar conversant with all the ramifications of his sub - ject .

		He is equally at home in discussing the ivory-worker 's art as practiced in
Europe	LOCATION	in modem times , and its application to chessmen , draughtsmen , furniture , musical instrum.enfc `` .

		weapons , and various other things .

		A large num - ber of the more important pieces in European collections are described in some detail .

		When he turns to the Orient , the author ' o information is not so wide , nor is so much of it at first-hand .

		The chaptier on
China	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	^ though it contains no serious errors , is the weak est in the book .

		It is cliiefly taken up with net - sukes , concerning which he admits that in the opinion of many connoisseurs -LRB- and of all Japa - nese , though he does not say so -RRB- the wooden ones are best ; but ' there are considerations , ' he thinks , which , ` other things being equal , ' ought to make us prefer the ivory ones !

		Of the okimono of recent years , though some of them are of rare merit , he has nothing to say , except that the finest ones are ' quite modem . '

		His orthography of Japanese names is not im - peccable .

		The occurrence of '
Shintu	PERSON	' and '
Shintuism	PERSON	' on the same page with Shinto , the correct form , is a blunder that is espedally noticeable because the book is unusually free from such mistakes .

		The ransre and varietv of the information
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 241 scattered throughout the book is very great .

		One item which should perhaps be noted here is the extent of the importation of ivory into
Europe	LOCATION	.

		In
1900	DATE	it represented no less than 30,000 slain elephants .

		For billiard-balls alone , the
London	LOCATION	dealers require tusks from 5,000 elephants annually .

		The wonder is that the supply has not long ago given out entirely .

		Col - lectors and students will appreciate the chapter on forgeries , coloring and staining , artificial ivory , and other matters of interest .

		The book is made serviceable by an ample index , a bib - liography , lists of ivories , with a table giving their origin , date , dimensions , and present ownership , and also b \ ^ the very full and excel - lent illustrations for which the collotj-pe process has been used with most satisfying results .

		A minor defect is the omission in the text of ref - erences to the plates .

		This is unfortunate , since it makes it troublesome for the reader to collate the descriptions of objects with the representa - tions of them that are given .

		And it is made more aggravating by wrong attributions to the plates in the list of ivories intended to supplv ttie deficiency .

		For instance , wherever an object is said to be illustrated on plate VII. , it will be found on plate Y. , and vice versa .

		But , as has been said before , the faults of the book are ex - ceedingly slight .

		It is handsomely printed , light in the hand for so large a volume , and the appeal it makes to the eye is not belied on closer acquaintance .

		The Yol ` th of Xapoleox .

		* No part of Xapoleon 's life is so difficult to portray as his youth and his military career up to his employment at the siege of
Toulon	LOCATION	.

		School-days or positions of subordinate com - mand do not offer scenes adequate to the stag - ing of extraordinary actions .

		There is some - thing petty and cramping even about the tur - moil of
Corsica	LOCATION	, so that the most serious risk run by the young hero is not the assassin 's knife or the party guillotine , but coming off with a belittling reputation .

		Under the circumstances , the biographer , especially if his knowledge of the evidence is so complete that he must reject the usual legendary material , useful in heighten - ing effects , must tell the story plainly , with occasionally a generalization hardly borne out by the narrative but testifying to the convic - tion that his hero 's youth was somehow in keep - ing with his later career .

		If there is anjrthing disappointing about such a good piece of work as Mr.
Browning	PERSON	's , this is the reason .

		* Kapoleox :
The Fibst Phase	ORGANIZATION	.

		Some Chapters on the Boyhood and
Youth of Bonaparte	ORGANIZATION	, 1769-1793 .

		By
Oscar Browning	PERSON	,
M.A.	LOCATION	With portraits .

		New York :
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		In his Introduction the author explains that his work is based primarily upon the material which
M. Masson	PERSON	has published in '
Napoleon Inconnu	PERSON	' and M. Chuquet in ' La Jeunesse de Napoleon . '

		The labors of M. Chuquet espe - cially have added much to what has been known of the military schools of the old regime and of the organization of the army just before the Bevolution .

		M. Chuquet has also thrown a good deal of light into the confusions of Cor - sican polities , but Mr.
Browning	PERSON	confesses that it is still difficult to form a satisfactory judg - ment about several incidents in which
Napo	ORGANIZATION	- leon had a share , * because we do not know enough about Corsiean manners and customs . '

		The account of the military schools at
Brienne	LOCATION	and at
Paris	LOCATION	gives a remarkably clear view of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's opportunities for intellectual prepa - ration .

		Incidentally , it appears that the morak of the boys at
Brienne	LOCATION	were in a deplorable state , and this , in Mr.
Browning	PERSON	's opinion , ex - plains the fact that for some time
Napoleon	PERSON	held aloof from his fellow students .

		In the
Ecole Militaire	ORGANIZATION	at
Paris	LOCATION	, the moral tone was better .

		In spite of his original aversion , for his fellow-students at
Brienne	LOCATION	, he seems to have lavished promotion upon several of them years later when power came into his hands .

		His teachers also were richly rewarded .

		Unhappily , one of these was Pich ^ ru , whose reward chanced to be a tragic death as a conspirator against his old pupil .

		Were one to read the conclusion of this bode first , the suspicion might be provoked that Mr.
Browning	PERSON	is so warm an admirer of
Napoleon	PERSON	that the evidence has received the most favor - able interpretation .

		The words are : * Sarelv , in his ease also , the youth is father of the man ; and twenty-three years spent under the most difficult circumstances which could try the qualities of a character , crowned by high success legitimately gained , are not likely to have been fol - lowed by twenty-three other years stained by uni - versal ambition , reckless duplicity , and an aimless lust of bloodshed .

		The contemplation of this la - borious and brilliant youth may , perhaps , dispose Englishmen to look more favourably upon those epochs of his career when devotion to the interests of
France	LOCATION	made him , for a time , the most formid - able enemy of our own country . '

		It is not a little strange that Mr.
Browning	PERSON	has found no serious lack of honor , to say noth - ing of ordinary honesty , in
Napoleon	LOCATION	's explana - tions of prolonged absence without leave from his regiment while he was in
Corsica	LOCATION	fishing in troubled waters and accomplishing nothing of advantage except for his own faction .

		In the course of the struggle a law of the
Legislative Assembly	ORGANIZATION	recalled to their regiments all volun - teer officers below the rank of lieutenant-colonel .

		To save himself from a forced return to
France	LOCATION	,
Napoleon	PERSON	became a candidate for the position 242 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, of second lieutenant-colonel in a Gorsican bat - talioii of volunteers .

		One of the three commis - sioners who were to preside at the election was to lodge at the house of a rival .

		Napoleon sent a friend to bring - this commissioner by force to his own house .

		He said to him , * I desired that you should be free ; you are not free with the
Peraldi	LOCATION	; here you are at home . '

		Possibly this was a reminiscence of the way the Parisians rendered
Louis XVI	PERSON	. '

		free ' by forcibly remov - ing him to
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Browning	PERSON	gravely dis - cusses the question whether
Napoleon	PERSON	's act of violence accounted for his election as second lieutenant-colonel .

		Mr.
J. H. Rose	PERSON	, another Englishman who has recently written on
Napo	ORGANIZATION	- leon with the saane material before him , calls it his ' first coup / A comparison with Mr.
Rose	PERSON	's conclusions in several other cases shows liow favorable are Mr ,
Browning	PERSON	's interpreta - tions of evidence .

		Upon the disputed question of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's share in the plan of campaign against
Toulon	LOCATION	, Mr.
Browning	PERSON	also adopte the view that it was
Napoleon	PERSON	who first pointed out the strategic value of the peninsula of L'Eguil - lette .

		Except in one or two instances like this , the author furnishes enough of the evidence to guard the reader against a too ready acceptance of all the inferences .

		In Appendix I. are three of
Napoleon	PERSON	's minor papers , of which the one on
Corsica	LOCATION	is the most interesting in its revelation of the tendencies and methods of his thought .

		His pamphlet , ' Le Souper de
Beaucaire	LOCATION	, ' is analyzed at length , with selected passages , in the body of the book .

		A second appendix gives several papers , from the British Museum , on the operations at
Tou	ORGANIZATION	- lon .

		Altogether this is an important contribu - tion to the study of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's early career , clearing away the accretions of legend and pre - !

		` The Meditations of an ex-Sehool-Committee Woman ' contain sensible suggestions on common-school education and edu - cators , including a protest against the modern method of dispensing with text-books and mak - ' ing the teacher and the blackboard and the note - book take their place .

		A little more training of the child in the use of printed books , a little less educing of the subject-matter out of the vacant mind of the pupil , and thus a good deal less labor and discouragement on the teacher 's part , are advocated .

		The present-day constipated course of study , embi * acing various matters un - dreamt-of by those
Hallowell	PERSON	youths and maid - ens , is also deprecated .

		In ` The
Browning Tonic	ORGANIZATION	' an inspiriting word is spoken for the bracing in - fluence of
Browning	ORGANIZATION	's verse .

		Mrs.
Dunn	PERSON	is dis - posed to ` welcome each rebuff that turns earth 's smoothness rough , ' and she avails herself of this text to have a little fling at peace congresses and at ` the attitude of the American people -- too large a proportion of them at least -- toward the Cuban war . '

		To her this unmartial attitude ` illustrates the deterioration of fibre which is the result of an unstrenuous standard . '

		From her point of view , and to one bearing in mind the perilously narrow dividing line between concilia - tion and cowardice , between forbearance and fear , she is hard to answer .

		But may there not be a lai ` gei '' , a saner , a still more courageous phil - osophy of the vexed question , that shall in the interests of our common humanity , and of our spiritual rather than our physical evolution , dare to brave the taunt of cowai-dice -- a harder thing than to face the enemy 's cannon ?

		Yet the good temper of his volume can not shield it from the serious eon - sequences of its offense ; and to those who cher - ish as something precious the reputation of science and the worth and ideals of the votaries thereof , equally with those who draw from re - ligious faith a sensitiveness and a healthy-mind - erdness that make for intellectual refinement and stability , the volume is nothing less than offiensive .


1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 24S More especially is the name of psychology -- so unfortunately yet inevitably associated with psychic research -- taken in vain , and , by those who know not the true character of that science , made to appear contemptible .

		There is a logical as well as a religious faith ; and whatever of in - terest or enlightenment may cling to the conglom - erate of ` cases ' here massed , after we shall be informed as to their modus operandi the assump - tion that they require supernormal hypotheses is intolerable .

		In that direction lies , not science , but learned superstition .

		Naturally , one express - ing this opinion is called dogmatic , and is invited to consider how often • residual ' unexplained phe - nomena have led to important discoveries .

		This , as well as other analogies that are abused in the volume , may be disqualified by a simile , and this must suflBce as a commentary upon the logical obliquity that pervades those who ` research ' in Dr.
Hyslop	PERSON	's temper .

		His attitude is comparable to that of a student of human locomotion who re - gards the actual problems of how men really walk with material muscles on actual terra jirvnja , as commonplace , but who is keen for any evi - dence of flying -LRB- we all fly in dreams -RRB- , or walking on air or water , or other supernormal accom - plishments ; and who regards his position as mod - est because he does not propose an ambitious soaring in the clouds , but only an occasional s -LCB- X -RRB- radic case of walking just a few inches above the ground .

		Ra ^ th - er is it a diary of incidents , reflections , and mem - ories , with occasional references to the garden which the author over-looks as she writes .

		The scene is
Ijakhnao	LOCATION	,
India	LOCATION	, and the anon3mous writer is an English captain 's wife , whose diary covers a period from
October	DATE	to Jime , the most extreme limit of a stay in the plains for ordinary white folks .

		So minute are .

		some of the descrip - tions , that one gets a fairly vivid impression of the life in that far coimtry , where so many Englishmen are condemned to spend their lives , where their devoted wives accompany them , and where white children , because of the terrible cli - mate , are almost unknown .

		The many devices for mitigating the heat are described , together with its effects on man , beast , and vegetation .

		There are accounts of the social life of the white residents , and of the ways of the dirtj - natives , of whose habits one must not think too closely , when so much of life is dependent upon them , -- for the intense heat is so enervating that it in - duces i-eliance upon the labor of others .

		In the
Mem-Sahib	ORGANIZATION	's garden , the mistress does nothing herself ; she merely stands by and directs her servants .

		What energy she has is devoted to the necessary visiting , -- for there is much ceremony connected with the military service ; to riding in the cool of the day , generally very early in the morning ; and to superintending her house - hold .

		She describes two or three hunting expedi - tions , one for wild boar ; a flower-show iu ` Caesar 's Garden ' ; a high-caste native festivity , ` memorial service and garden-party combined , ' the Mohurrum in the Hosein-a-bad ; and the wed - ding of a certain lovely
Belinda	PERSON	, whose flirtations have caused her neighbor much trepidation .

		Nu - merous incidents of the Mutiny are related , in connection with excursions into the town and adjoining country .

		Quite lengthy directions are given for skinning and motmting birds and ani - mals , which the hunters generally do for them - selves .

		There are occasional lapses into reflec - tions that smack of the school-girl essay , and quo - tations and allusions abound on every page .

		One suspects that these latter are given from memory , without verification , especially when lines from
Browning	PERSON	's ` Home Thoughts from Abroad * are attributed to Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	.

		The writer also has the bad habit of adapting her quotations to her needs , while still retaining the marks of quo - tation .

		However , in spite of these faults and such others as an awkwaitl style of writing and the lack of a glossary of Indian words , the book contains a good deal that is of interest in regard to life and nature in

		i ^ ng
Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is not only a distinctly readable little essay , but it is illuminating as well .

		It would be hard to find a more persuasive state - ment of a certain way of looking at the task of philosophy -- a way to which not all philosophers by any means would give approval , but which will at least , it is likely , open up a new outlook to many a perplexed reader to whom the word has represented something wholly vague and misty in its demarkations , if not a scientific im - possibility .

		That the higher realities are not phe - nomenal ' fact , ' but the things which concern the ` buried life , ' the sub-conscious self of direct emotional appreciation of meanings ; that these objects of faith , incapable of taking the form of an exact logical system of knowledg ^ e , yet need deepening and purifying bj ' the giving of an out - let to the imprisoned waters ; and that thought -- philosophy -- is one of the ways of attaining this , conduct and poetry being the other two ; that the method of philosophy is the imagination working imder the supervision of reason to cre - ate an ideal hypothesis that shall provide for the satisfaction of the heart 's desires ; that the test of philosophic trutli lies finally in its capacity to be re-absorbed into those depths of uncon - scious spirituality in which truth loses itself in reality , its value in the quickening it gives to this inner life , -- these are some of the significant points of the teaching of the essay , put with real insight and much felicity of expression .

		Or , to sum it up in brief , ` The function of
Philoso	LOCATION	- phy is to interpret and justify to man 's reason the imconquerable optimism of his heart . '

		-- Mr.
Raymond St. James Perrin	PERSON	's work entitled ` The Evolution of Knowledge ' -LRB-
Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a review of the history of philosophy -- cul - minating in
G. H. Lewes	LOCATION	-- which is intended to justify the author 's own philosophic faith .

		This 244 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, is summed up in the generalization that ultimate reality is motion , to which mind and matter alike are to be reduced , and of which space and time are tlie objective and subjective aspects .

		As his - tory , the treatment is too scrappy to be of first - rate value , and the author 's inability to interpret other men 's thoughts except in the light of his own scientific dogmatism makes his exposition one-sided and at times inaccurate .

		His construc - tive philosophy would perhaps be more convincing if he had not stopped with assertions , but had at - tempted something in the way of proof , or at least had given evidence of recognizing the need of an adequate analysis of his conceptions .

Mary Louise Hendee	PERSON	's fluent and apparently care - ful translation .

		Yet it must be admitted that these new chapters contain little that is essen - tially new to those familiar with the volumes that have preceded .

		The title can not be called strikingly apposite , although the spirit of toler - ance is in a general way the main theme of the book .

		* A disposition to unfairness , bad faith , and evil-speaking , is abroad in every field , ' says the author in his preface , ` and a matter over which men do not contend at daggers drawn , is hard to find . '

		To counteract this evil the little book teaches the lesson of sweet reasonableness and Christian charity .

		Of patriotism , as distinct from chauvinism , or jingoism , we read , -- ` Just as I honour the memory of my father in the grey hair of a stranger , and understand every father 's heart through the tenderness I bear my children , so do I honour my country in honouring the country of others .

		Wherever this respect is wanting , the quality of patriotism should be mis - trusted . '

		Many equally sensible utterances could be quoted .

		But as these excellent booklets of
M. Wagner	PERSON	issue in quick succession from the press , the query will intrude itself .

		Are such reitera - tions of good counsel the things most needed by us and most praiseworthy in the writer ?

		Is there not some danger lest ` nursed by mealy-mouthed philanthropies , ' we ` divorce the Feeling from her mate the Deed ' ?

		Are we not perhaps in - dulging just a little too freely in those flaccid sublimities so alluring to the imaginative and emotional seeker for spiritual quickening ?

		With more time allowed us to ponder and to live up to the author 's earlier teachings , may it not be bet - ter for us and work no detriment to the popular French preacher 's fame in the end ?

		Virginal Book ' -LRB- Button -RRB- , proves on examination to be a critical essay on the con - tents of a manuscript in the

		The book is interesting to the student of musical history , as it contains exam - ples of every kind of music that was current dur - ing the
Tudor Period	ORGANIZATION	in
England	LOCATION	.

		Over thirty composers of the day are represented , and the collection is more correctly regarded as a library than as a mere book ; it contains more direct knowledge of the musical practice of Tudor times than most of us have of the music of our own century .

		The author states that his work is in - tended for two distinct classes of readers -- first , students of the history of music who have access to the published
Fitzwilliam	LOCATION	Virginal Book , but have been prevented from giving it the attention it deserves , by reason of its great size and vari - ous contents ; second , students of the Elizabethan and Jacobean Drama , who daily increase in numbers , and are often at a loss for musical illustrations such as are necessary for the repre - sentation of these works on even a humble scale .

		Mr.
Naylor	PERSON	has shown himself to be more than a mere antiquarian ; while the method of his book is simple , he appears as an industrious and pains - taking writer .

		It is a valuable work of reference , for it embodies all that can be required by one who is desirous of gaining a clear idea of the music of this interesting period .

		The view - point of the author is distinctly French , and it is that of a man of affairs , four years resident in the country , with abundant opportunities for travel , reading , and observation , all of which have been intelligently improved .

		Evidently his reading has been chiefly in the work of the French missionary .

		Abbe Hue , which appeared in
1862	DATE	, and from which , and the Peking ` Gazette , ' the oldest newspaper in the world , his most extensive quotations are made .

		The book has no air of hasty generalization ; the chapters , though brief , are full of information , set forth in the clearest possible manner , and the whole book , despite the strangeness and even repellant character of some of the Chinese customs , exemplifies the truth of the Italian proverb to the effect that all the world is like one 's own family .

Claudes Ptolemeus	PERSON	came the first idea of a peg by which to regulate the tension of the strings ; from the
Rebec	LOCATION	, six centuries later , came the first idea of a finger-board , and the foundation of the pitch of the first three strings of the fiddle ; from the
Crouth	PERSON	came the first idea of the ribs .

		Finally , from the early viols , which first appeared in the fifteenth century in
Germany	LOCATION	, came the crude out - line of the violin .

		Bulky and heavy-looking as were these early viols , yet one can distinctly trace in them a noble striving toward the graceful curves of the perfect Stradivarius form .

		His - torical and biographical sketches of Italian and German makers are followed by an interesting chapter on the manner of preserving and playing the violin ; and an appendix is devoted to the life and anecdotes of Paganni .

		Miss Racster 's treat - ise is clear and concise , and not of such a technical nature as to burden the ordinary reader .

		To their successful ` New Century Library ' Messrs.

Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, in six volumes .

		The edition is of pocket size , clearly printed and attractively bound , with a frontispiece illustration in each volume .

London	LOCATION	:
Luzac & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The hvimor and satire in the writings of Jewish scholars , ancient and modern , forms the leading theme of many of the articles .

		The most interesting and complete papers are those dealing with
Mediaeval Writers	ORGANIZATION	,
Immanuel di Roma	ORGANIZATION	, and
Leopold Zunz	PERSON	.

		The form is generally biographical , citation taking the place of criticism to a large ex - tent .

		This detracts from the literary value of the essays , while adding to their usefulness as a refer - ence collection .

		The volume will be of service to Jewish rabbis and writers , and to others who de - sire a survey of this interesting subject .

		Price ,
$ 1.40	MONEY	net .

		It is impossible to think of Shelley without associating him with
Italy	LOCATION	.

		It was during the Italian period of his life that his genius matured , and it was the atmosphere and surroundings of that coimtry which inspired him to produce such masterpieces as '' Prometheus Unbound , '' '' Ode to the West `` Wind , '' and • ' The Cenci . ''

		But it is not only in his verse that
Shelley	PERSON	has celebrated
Italy	LOCATION	, but also in his descriptions which have been handed down to us in the shape of letters .

		It has been the author 's aim in this volume to present the poems in their original environment , and to conduct the reader into that very atmosphere where they were created .

		This she has attempted by means of illustrations , and also by letters and passages from note-books , which are arranged with the poems , so that the latter may be seen in the making .

		This is the object of the volume , and the idea , which has been most successfully carried out , makes a book of exquisite charm and unique interest .

		Special attention is called to the
Large Paper	ORGANIZATION	editions , which are of extreme beauty , and meet all the requirements of a handsome gift hook .

		The text is printed on Italian hand-made paper , and the iZlustrations in broum ink on

		From these he has gathered many interesting facts which will be of great value to students of Omarian literature .

		The author has a particularly graceful style , and the handsome way in which the book is produced -- the cover , title page , and chapter headings representing hand Ulumination in the Pei-sian stjde -- make it one of extreme beauty .

		In its scrupulous exactness the work does not lose sight of the fascinating human side of its subject .

		It tells not only who the writer was and what he wrote , but what he looked like , where he lived , who were his teachers , who his pupils , what his hand-writing was , and how he appeared in caricature to his contemporaries .

		The illustrations are a supremely important feature of the work .

		One critic remarks : '' To turn these pages is like visit - ing a museum of old manuscripts and paintings , and it is need - less to say what a powerful instrument this is in making the subject vivid and raising the interest . ''

		It is almost impossible to find a page without some document of great interest or value .

		The appeal of this work must not be misunderstood .

		It is not confined to any class or section .

		It is impossible for anyone to open it and not find something to hold him interested as few story books can . ''

		BRIEFER MENTION 279 NOTES 279 TOPICS IN LEADING PERIODICALS ... 280 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 280 THE MAN OF ONE BOOK .

		After reading for upwards of a score of years , with stimulus and profit , the editorial columns of the
Xew York * Evening Post	ORGANIZATION	' and ' Nation , ' we have been impressed , per - haps more than by any other single feature , with the editor 's frequent and apposite quo - tations from
Burke	PERSON	.

		Both for the pointing of political morals and the adornment of instruc - tive tales , the great Irish statesman and orator has been drawn upon for the final word of wisdom , and his armory seems never to have failed to supply the needed argumentative weapon .

		Upon countless occasions we have admired the effectiveness of the instrument and the deftness of its use , and marvelled at the sagacity of the writer whose words have been found thus to anticipate the exigencies of political conditions widely different from any that came within the range of
Burke	PERSON	's own experience .

		We have been well aware that this felicitous modem use of an eighteenth - century treasury of counsel and apophthegm was the result of the late
E. L. Godkin	PERSON	's inti - mate familiarity with the thought of the man whom , more than any other , he had chosen as his mentor , and it is a noteworthy tribute to Mr ,
Godkin	PERSON	's personality that the tradi - tion thus fixed by him should continue to be illustrated -LRB- as is the case -RRB- by his editorial associates and successors .

		An influence and a tradition of similar nature may be found in recent British journalism of the more dignified type , and in tiiis instance it is clearly trace - able to the editorial activities of Mr ,
John Morley	PERSON	, who had likewise sat long at the feet of the same
Irish Gamaliel	PERSON	, and entertained for him the same whole-hearted admiration .

		The English writer who deals with ques - tions of political philosophy is fortunate in - deed in thus being able to find texts for every manner of political discourse in the pages of a single approved classic .

		Burke is the most pronounced example of the political sage to be found in English literature , probably in any modern literature .

		Even the Frenchman , proud of the glory of
Montesquieu	LOCATION	and Vol - taire , must yield the palm to the Englishman in this ; and the German is nowhere .

		This tribute to a great thinker by no means im - plies that
Burke	PERSON	was always right , or that his vision was not sometimes darkened by preju - dice , but it does mean that his wise utter - ances vastly outnumbered his unfortunate ones , and that he had , beyond almost all other po - litical philosophers , the gift of impressive and pregnant expression .

		We do not intend , however , to write an essay upon
Burke	PERSON	at the present moment , and we have invoked his name for the sole purpose of illustrating what benefits may accrue to the * man of one book ' -- if the book be big enough -- who knows his author through and through .

		To be a ` man of one book ' in the right sense is not to be a narrow-minded per - son or one subservient to another 's thought , for such a man may have the widest range of 262 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, acquaintance with literature and the broadest of intellectual sympathies .

		But it means that some one great writer has become his fa - miliar , almost in the old superstitious sense , and is ever at his ear with whispered prompt - ings and words of counsel , and phrases which may fitly clothe the idea struggling for ex - pression .

		We all have occasion to acknowledge this kind of debt to literature in general , but that is not quite the same thing as finding the obligation concentrated in a single gen - erous creditor .

		The random inspirations that come to the mind of eclectic tendencies do not contribute to the upbuilding of as solid and consistent a framework of thought as do those that originate in a single source .

		It is a question , not so much of the particular idea , which may possibly be a wrong one , as of the general intellectual temper that comes from reliance upon the teachings of some one master .

		This habit of ` tying ' , as it were , to one of the great writers provides the reason with a regulative principle that will avail to steady it .

		in many a critical moment .

		The Bible , of course , has served more largely than any other writing in this controlling relation , and , par - ticularly with Englishmen , has been found an unfailing thesaurus of wisdom fitly ex - pressed for application to the conduct of life .

		Indeed , as
Green	ORGANIZATION	so eloquently pointed out , the whole English nation was made a nation of one book by its devotion to the sacred Scriptures during the period from the
Eefor	PERSON	- mation to the Restoration .

		Countless English - men in later times have ` tied ' to Shakes - peare in much the same fashion , finding him adequate to the full measure of their spir - itual needs .

		Plato and
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	,
Cicero	PERSON	and
Horace	PERSON	, among the ancients , have numbered their disciples in all subsequent ages ; while among the moderns ,
Bacon	PERSON	and Montaigne have had each his grateful personal following .

		Those of us who require the thought that par - ticularly moves us to have something of the color of life as it exists in our own age may prefer to sit at the feet of some master whose eyes have looked upon a world not unlike that in which we now live ; for such , the teachings of
Carlyle	PERSON	and
Emerson	LOCATION	, of
Schopen	PERSON	- hauer and
Kenan	PERSON	, have served as satisfying gospels .

		The chief desideratum for the in - dividual is that he attach himself to some thinker of sufficient distinction to provide him with intellectual ballast at need , yet that he at the same time preserve his own individ - uality , reacting upon the other 's thought , not content with its reproduction in feeble echo .

		Our opening illustration was concerned with the application of this principle to the worker in political philosophy .

		Our closing words shall take the form of an inquiry concerning its possible application to literary criticism .

		In other words , can the professional critic find anywhere among his predecessors so ` very worthy and approved ' a master as to justify him in the sort of loyalty that the political philosopher is warranted in bestowing upon
Burke	PERSON	?

		Put in this blunt form , the question must be answered with a negative .

		The an - cients are out of the question , for they did little more than establish the broader gener - alizations of criticism .

		Turning to the mod - erns , we think of
Dryden	PERSON	and

		Voltaire and
John	PERSON	- son also , oracles and prophets in their day , are too exclusively of the eighteenth century to interpret or illuminate the modes of thought in which the twentieth century frames its con - ception of literature .

		The Germans are per - haps more promising for our purpose , but their effectiveness suffers greatly from crabbed expression and an overplus of abstraction .

		Lessing was one of the wisest of critics , but hardly more serviceable than
Aristotle	PERSON	for the countless special problems of modern crit - icism .

		There remains for consideration the great - est of all the Germans , the greatest of all the moderns since
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, the author of '
Faust	PERSON	' and '

		Goethe had a comprehensive philosophy of life and art .

		He lived midway between the two centuries which were two distinct worlds in their out - look , but for him they were not describable as ' One dead .

		The other powerless to be born , ' for he preserved what was vital in the classical spirit of the earlier age , uniting it in the synthesis of his genius with the spirits of romance and of science which were to breathe life into the age to come .

		He not only pro- duced the greatest literary work of the mod - ern world , but he wrote from the fulness of his knowledge more wisely , on the whole , about literature than any of his contemporaries or successors has written .

		We may admit that his criticism of literature was only incidental to his imaginative work , but we must also allow that in volume and weight it was suf - ficient to make him a guide who rarely fails to supply the needful word of illumination upon any fundamental literary matter , and whose sayings nearly always have the preg - nancy of content and the lucidity of form that are essential for the uses that we have been

		THE DIAli 263 holding in view .

		He seems , on the whole , to meet more closeW than any other modem writer of distinction the definition of a sage of letters , as that definition has been implied in the foregoing reflections .

		One who wishes to think and write clearly about literature could hardly do better , and might easily do worse , than pin his faith to the precepts of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, and use his ipsissima verba for the adornment and conclusion of whatever literary argument may occupy the attention .

		THE SUPERNATURAL IN LITERATURE , Our benighted eighteenth-century ancestors called it machinery .

		They were rationalists and skeptics .

		Their literature was a litera - ture of social life .

		Their idea of Nature was the formal terraces and straight avenues of
Versailles	LOCATION	, the clipped hedges and mazes of
Kew	LOCATION	or
Hampton Court	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mountains to them were horrid haunts of gloom ; the ocean , merely the home of sea-sickness .

		But they were sound on the supernatural .

		They were mj-th-makers at heart .

		Voltaire , who believed m nothing , believed in ghosts for tragedy .

		Pope invented a graceful apparatus of sylphs for one poem , and a Goddess of Dulness and her court for another .

		The lyrical poets could not write a stanza without personifying a half-dozen abstract qualities .

		For poetry de - ploying all its forces , for the great epic , they thought that an array of contending gods and goddesses was a necessity which no sane per - son would question .

		Machinery it was for the most part that they succeeded in creat - ing , -- a creaking , soulless work of puppets and pulleys ; but their faith in it was a trib - ute to the highest instincts of mankind .

		They were right .

		Without the supernatural in some shape , great literature can hardly exist .

		Whatever is not touched by the imagina - tion , dies .

		And the imagination is almost a vassal of the supernatural .

		Mystery is its home , its haunt , its birthplace .

		From the beginning of time , the unexplainable facts of life , -- generation , growth , decay , death , the process of the seasons , the omnipotence of the sun , the motions of the stars , the strangeness of beast-life , -- have exercised the wits of man .

		His literature is largely a storehouse of guesses , dreams , delusions , in regard to those matters .

		The myth-making instinct persists down to our own day .

		Compelled by the prejudices of readers to cast aside old mythologies , our writers invent new ones out of their own heads .

		In
Victor Hugo	PERSON	's ' Toilers of the Sea ' the ocean is the sentient , terrible , treach - erous antagonist of the man .

		In '
Notre Dame	ORGANIZATION	' he personifies a cathedral ; and ` Les Miserables ' is filled with sombre and sinister shapes , -- the demonology of a great city .


Thomas Hardy	PERSON	's ` Return of the
Native	ORGANIZATION	* pro- jects a great waste of melancholy moorland as the overruling
Providence	LOCATION	of the piece .


Herman Melville	PERSON	's ` Moby
Dick	PERSON	' is the story of a supernatural whale , a veritable demon of the deep , which eludes , fights , and finally destroys its maddened hunter and his ship .

		Poe 's whole work is an even more successful attempt than any of these to create , ab ovo , the elements of awe and mystery .

		But all such individual efforts after the supernatural are as a sandwich to a seventeen - course banquet compared with the great racial works of mythology and demonologv .

		Look - ing at the vast population of divinities , spir - its , ghosts , and the like , which first and last have been in being , one is thankful that they did not take up space or they would have in - fallibly crowded humanity off the earth .

		The literature of the spirit-world possibly begins with the
Eamayana	LOCATION	and the
Mahah	PERSON	- harata .

		The vicinity of the greatest and most mysterious mountains of the world prob - abl -RCB- ' accounts for the enormous though vague powers of the Hindoo divinities and demons .

		What accounts for the utter spirit of unreason which animates them and pervades also the actions of the human agents who come in contact with them , I can not say .

		The super - natural elsewhere in the world is in some sense natural .

		There is a logic in its life , a measure in its miracles .

		But in the Indian poems it is wild , disordered , fluctuating , un - foreseen , -- a chaotic dream .

		There are human figures and actions in these poems which are affecting , beautiful , magnificent ; but they too are superior to any law .

		Hermits live a thou - sand years without food , or standing on one leg , and win thereby virtue which enables them to contend with the supreme deities .

		The blackest villains are invulnerable to gods .

		There is a monkey race whose powers trans - cend those of man .

		The Pandu brothers , in the
Mahabharata	LOCATION	, are at one moment beg - gars and suppliants , and the next they are panoplied in might and able to contend sin - gle-handed with armies .

		Possibly the Hindoo unreasonableness is the truest supernatural .

		Persian literature , at least in the
Shah Xameh	PERSON	, does not greatly extend itself on the side of the supernatural .

		Sultans and heroes , it is true , live a thousand or fifteen hundred years .

		There is one king who has a snake growing out of his shoulders which had to be fed with the flesh of virgins .

		Bustem 's seven 264 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, labors were largely expeditions against demons and powers of darkness .

		But the Persian imagination did not body forth a mythology with any great vigor .

		Possibly its great dii - alistic religion , the most philosophic religion of the world , crushed out minor .

		exhibitions of the divine or the demoniac .

		The same is true of the Arabs , who , genii , afreets , and ma - gicians , seem rather monotonous personages ,
Beckford	PERSON	's '
Vathek	PERSON	' is really more
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	than the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	tales and poems , in its tre - mendous energy of invention .

		It is a commonplace qf criticism , that the Greeks only projected their own pretty and harmonious persons into their Pantheon .

		Their mythology is a matter of ideals rather than of idols .

		Yet there was unquestionably a dark shadow to their sunny supernaturalism .

		One does not usually , associate ghosts and the Black Art with their imaginings , yet Apu - leius is full of rather grewsome witchcraft .

		There is a play of Plautus , imitated probably from Menander , which has to do with a haunt - ed house .

		Goethe 's ^ Bride of
Corinth	LOCATION	' is the version of a Greek legend .

		The best part of the Pioman mythology , and the most fruitful for literature , was its humble rustic divinities -- Faunus ,
Sylvanus	PERSON	, Priapus , the
Lars	PERSON	and Lemures .

		The Latin Pantheon was filled with didactic deities who weighed upon poetry like lead .

		And later , during the Empire , when the great Eastern gods -- the
Magna Mater	ORGANIZATION	, the mysterious
Mithra	LOCATION	,
Isis	ORGANIZATION	,
Scrapis	PERSON	, and the dog-faced Ana - bis , entered
Rome	LOCATION	, in turn , in triumph , like an Imperator , they had little inspiration for literature .

		Possibly the rising power of
Chris	PERSON	- tianity strangled their influence .

		For nearly two thousand years , Christianity , with its enormous mythology of spiritual and demoniac powers , its angelology , its hierar - chies of saints and martyrs , its miracles and its remissions of sins , has filled the civilized world and satisfied man 's sense of awe and worship .

		It has touched all acts with a wand of life , and caused them to blos - som in prodigious efflorescence .

		The poems of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	,
Ariosto	PERSON	,
Tasso	LOCATION	,
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	, and
Milton	PERSON	, the Arthurian legends which it remodelled after its own image , the plays of
Calderon	PERSON	and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and
Goethe	PERSON	and a myriad minor works , testif -RCB- ^ to its power .

		No other spirit - ual influence has had a tithe of its ap - praisable effect .

		The Scandinavian mythology is a good rival of the Greek and
Hindoo	PERSON	ones .

		The clear and beautiful Greek divinities would perhaps have scorned the one-eyed Wotan or the blacksmith-like Thor , but in a contest for sublimity those last would have it all their own way .

		Celtic imagination is supposed to have in - fluenced or moulded the Icelandic sagas , but the Celtic gods are very indifferent and un - impressive personages compared with those of the farther North , The Celtic supernatural comes out best as a kind of a glamor cast over Nature .

		It suffuses the visible world with magic , but hardly concentrates into fig - ures of commanding power .

		We know prac - tically nothing about the Druidic cult , but it looms large as a thing of awe and mystery ,
Scotland	LOCATION	, down to modern times , is a land of bogles , witches , warlocks , and worrie-cows .

		Scott and
Burns	PERSON	came into a great inherit - ance of the supernatural , which they bettered and enlarged .

		It is hardly realized how much
Scott	PERSON	was dominated by the mystery and magic of the spirit world .

		No English author save
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	has so felt its power .

		He was accused of having a
Meg Merrilies	PERSON	in every one of his books , after that impressive figure was first created .

		But his early j -RRB- oems show the trend of his imagination quite as dis - tinctly .

		In the wake of the conquering hosts of Christian mythology , many superstitions sprang up throughout
Europe	LOCATION	, -- survivors of the first or original denizens of wood and field .

		Venus , driven from
Olympus	ORGANIZATION	, retired into the
Venusberg	LOCATION	-- the Siren became the
Lorelei	LOCATION	.

		Of phantom tilings that seem to have originated in the middle ages , the Loup-garou and the Were-wolf were perhaps the most horrible .

		The French beast epics and fabliaux hardly come into the province of the super - natural , but they show man 's instincts stirred by the strangeness of animal life -- its like - ness to , yet removedness from , his own .

		Calderon has a figure in one of his plays called El Embozado , which has been the an - cestor of a long and distinguished line in lit - erature .

		In the original legend which
Cal	LOCATION	- deron used , a man is pursued wherever he goes by pieces of paper falling from the skies , on each of which he finds inscribed his own name .

		The hero of the play is haunted by a masked and cloaked figure which appears to him at all times and places .

		At last he turns upon it with his sword , -- they fight , and the intruder falls to the ground .

		He removes the mask from its face , and beholds -- him - self .

		There is a similar idea in a ballad of
Gongora	LOCATION	.

		A man is on his way to an assigna - tion with a nun .

		He meets a funeral cortege , and is inexplicably drawn to follow it .

		The train enters a lighted church ; the coffin is placed before the altar , and mass is performed .

		Then the company silently files out , and the man advances and looks upon the face in the coffin .

		It is his own .

		Of course this idea

		The personages of

Oberon	LOCATION	,

Robin Goodfellow	PERSON	, indeed , is the most characteristic English sprite .

		Queen
Mab	PERSON	is supposed to be a reincarnation of Queene Meve of the great Irish epic c ^ ` cle , though she must have changed marvellously in the course of cen - turies .

		The Witches of Lancashire were famous before
Ainsworth	PERSON	wrote of them .

		The powers which mortals acquired by con - tact or contract with divinities or demons were very various .

		Faust received back his youth .

		The Scotch nobleman in the ' Legend of Mont - rose , ' and the Bard in
Campbell	ORGANIZATION	's `
Lochiel	LOCATION	, ' were experts at second-sight .

		The heroine of
Rossetti	PERSON	's ' Rose
Mary	PERSON	' saw her lover 's fate reflected in the
Beryl Stone	LOCATION	; the heroine of another of his ballads had the pleasant gift of making a man waste away as his wax image melted before a fire .

		Any friend of Asmodeus could have the roofs of houses lifted for him .

		Levitation , however , was the great gift of demonolog -RCB- ' .

		The most prominent fact about witches was that they rode on broomsticks .

		One can shut one 's eyes and see the air of
Europe	LOCATION	blackened with these beings , all making their wav to the
Hartz	LOCATION	mountain .

		As Goethe ' The further northward one doth go .

		The plentier soot and witches grow . '

		I have sketched but an incomplete outline of this great subject .

		Volumes would be re - `` juired to do justice to ghosts alone ; and the < ioings and disguises of the Fiend himself would fill a library .

		What I have wished to show is the importance of the supernatural for literature .

		Perhaps we are better without it in life .

		I for one have no wish to revive com - l '' acts with the Devil , or the burning of witches .

		But we can hardly have books that thrill and ' iithrall , without some use of the things of the - pirit world .

		There has always been something in the air `` f
America	LOCATION	as fatal to superstition as the soil • f

		After Ponce de Leon 's ' | UGst , and the witch-fires of
Xew England	LOCATION	, there is hardly a gleam of the supernatural in ■ ur historv .

		DeSoto 's march to the Missis - - ippi in search of gold is emblematic of our -RSB- > rogress .

		Xothing , indeed , is more remarkable than the spectacle of a great people crush - ing its way over a continent , coming in con - tact with new scenes and strange experiences , yet evincing no excitement over the unknown , holding steadily to the practical and to the main chance .

		That is the reason why our national heroes are so impossible for poetry , -- why our national literature is so thin .


Daniel Boone	PERSON	would be as good a legendary hero as
Siegfried	PERSON	, if his
Ohio	LOCATION	woods had harbored wormlike dragons , if gnomes had been his companions and water-sprites his guardians , -- if , in short , he had been brought into some re - lation to the supernatural ,
Washington	LOCATION	would he as good a central figure for a drama as
Wallenstein	PERSON	, if like
Wallenstein	PERSON	he had trav - elled with a train of astrologers and magicians .

		The Indians whom we have dispossessed were a more imaginative race than ourselves , and a large part of such elevation and grandeur as does inhere in our literature is due to them .

		Our classic writers , indeed , were keenly alive to the value of the supernatural , and seized every possibility in our life that would give them a background of darkness , an air of mys - tery .

		Their successoi ^ have been in the main parochial and provincial .

		Their attitude tow - ard the great ideas of the world reminds me of a stor -RCB- - of a Aoung woman of my neighborhood .

		Being asked to accompany some friends to
Eitrope	LOCATION	, she - answered , hesitatingly , that she would like to go to
Europe	LOCATION	, she had heard a great deal of
Europe	LOCATION	, but she did hate to miss the Mt.
Holly	PERSON	fair .

		But let us not give up hope .

		Americans are not really different from other people .

		They must thrill with hopes and fears for the future , they must consult the oracles of life and death .

		Under the shadow of our noble but rather prosaic Protestant religion , an undergrowth of superstitions is springing up .

		Prett -RCB- ' urban or rural customs , which have their root in Pagan obsenances , are being revived .

		The Priestess of the
Black Hills	ORGANIZATION	reads the stars for more folk than we imagine .

		Chiro - mancy , hypnotism , and mind-reading flourish .

		We have no witches who can alter the boun - daries of our properties in a night , but our

		A young woman died in
Phila	LOCATION	- delphia not long ago who gave out that she was the bride of Christ .

		Her followers be - lieved in her to the extent of giving her a brick house .

		I have no desire to suggest that these things are good in themselves .

		But man must have some outlet into the unknown .

		We can not live by bread alone , nor subsist on a mental diet of stock reports , eulogies of the world 's work , and speeches of strenuous poli - ticians .

		Any change which will deepen our emotions and widen our intellects , must be for the better .

		And if such a change sets in , the literature which deals nobly with the super - natural must come into its own .

Una Hawthorne	ORGANIZATION	' and ` The Child and his Dreams ' -RRB- , as also many portraits and facsimile copies of letters .

		The best introduction the reviewer can give the book , to those still unfamiliar with its contents , is a generous selection of extracts from its pages .

		These ripe and scholarly chapters -- ' ripe with the varied experience of eighty years and more , and scholarly with the scholarship of a lover not only of books , but of men -- have an interest and value far ex - ceeding an3rthing that another pen might con - trive to say about them .

		The opening chapter , on ` The Sunny Side of the

		Father
Taylor	PERSON	's brilliant daughter , Mrs.
Russell	PERSON	, characterized those ' Disciples of the Newness ' as ' a race who dove into the infinite , soared into the illimitable , and never paid cash . '

		The article closes with a tJiought-provoking query .

		` But one question still remains , and perhaps will always remain , unanswerable .

		Considering the part originally done by the English Lake Poets in bring - ing about this period of sunshine in
America	LOCATION	, why is it that the leaders of English literature on its native soil for the
last half century	DATE	have had a mournful and clouded tone ?

		From
Carlyle	PERSON	and Rus - kin through
Froude	PERSON	and Arnold to
Meredith	LOCATION	,
Hardy	LOCATION	,
Stevenson	PERSON	, and
Henley	LOCATION	, all have had a prevailing air of sadness , and sometimes even of frightful gloom .

		Even
Tennyson	PERSON	, during at least a portion of his reactionary later life , and
Browning	PERSON	to - ward the end of his , showed the same tendency .

		In
America	LOCATION	, on the other hand , during the same general period , the leading literary figures , with the solitary exception of
Poe	PERSON	, -- who was wont to be an exception to all rules , -- were sunshiny and hopeful , not gloomy .

		This is certainly true of
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Alcott	LOCATION	,
Thoreau	LOCATION	,
Longfellow	LOCATION	,
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Holmes	PERSON	,
Whittier	LOCATION	,
Whitman	LOCATION	.

		Even if
Hawthorne	LOCATION	may have seemed to the world an exception be - cause of his reticence and sombre bearing , we must remember how he laid aside those traits within his own household .

		These and all the rest , save

		Why this difference ?

		It is not yet time , perhaps , to fathom the mystery and give a clear answer to the question . '

		Discoursing on English and American men - tal processes , with reference to their compara - tive quickness -- an oft-discussed question , in which we have always believed in our own superiority -- the author offers , among other observations , the following , in a chapter en - titled ' English and American Cousins ' : ` People who go slowly on new ground may turn out to be quick enough when wholly at home with any particular line of thought .

		How odious and complicated , for instance , seems to an American observer the computation of pounds , shillings , and pence !

		It seems strange that any nation should consent for a day to employ anything but a decimal currency ; yet with what lightning rapidity does a
London	LOCATION	bookkeeper make his computations !

		... Even in the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	, the unlikeness to an American deliberative body is found to vary according to the point from which you look at the discussion .

		The Englishman begins with a curious air of hesitation , whereas the American glides into his speech at once ; but the difference is that the Englishman suddenly surprises you by coming to his point with clearness and decision , after which he amazes you yet more by sitting down ; whereas the American , after his first good hit , is apt to seem intoxicated by hie own success , and feels bound to keep on indefinitely , waiting for another .

		You are left under the impression that an ideal speech in any debating body would be achieved by hav - ing an American to begin it and an Englishman to end it . ' '

		The Aristocracy of the Dollar ' contains a frank recognition of the evils of plutocracy , but also an encouraging view of its excellences , actual and possible ; of which the author shall be allowed to speak in his own person .

		` The aristocracy based on the dollar has its own weaknesses and follies , but it has certain merits .

		Its first merit is that it belongs to the present , not to the past ; it represents something that is being done , or has lately been done , whether for good or evil ; not something which has long gone by .

		When Theo - dore
Parker	PERSON	first visited
Cincinnati	LOCATION	, at that time the recognized leader among western cities , he said that he had made a great discovery , namely , that while the aristocracy of
Cincinnati	LOCATION	was unquestion - ably founded on pork , it made a great difference whether a man killed pigs for himself , or whether his father had killed them .

		The one was held plebeian , the other patrician .

		It was the difference
Parker	PERSON	said , between the stick 'em s and the stuck 'em s ; and his own sympathies , he confessed , were with the present tense .

		It was , in other words , aristocracy in the making .

		It stood for a race which had found forests to be cleared , streams to be bridged , and roads to be built ; the dollar was not only behind these forms of service , but it was the corner-stone of the schoolhouse and the church .

		It predicted a civilization which should belong to to-day , not to yesterday ; and belonging to to-day , should also predict to-morrow . '

		` If all the scholar 's education in a republic gives him no infallible advantage over the man who can not read or write , let the scholar have the man - liness not to whine over the results of his own inefficiency .

		How absurd would be any artificial system of equalization , such as we sometimes see gravely urged , which should give to the day laborer one vote , to the school-teacher two , to the lawyer or editor three , and to the author of a treatise on the United States Constitution ten !

		Natural laws provide much better for the end desired ; the edu - cation of the editor , the lawyer , the teacher , should enable him to carry dozens of less educated votes at his belt , as an Indian carries scalps .

		It is he who writes the editorials , he who makes the speeches ; all the machinery of conviction , for good or for evil , is intrusted to his hands .

		Upon which , one boy , more daring than the rest , ran up behind him and shouted in his ear , `` Cotton , thou art an old fool I '' `` I know it , I know it , '' shouted the old gentleman suddenly , `` the Lord make both thee and me wiser , '' and then reverted to his meditations .

		Whole pages of fact com - mitted to memory had left the life of that time stiU dull and mechanical , but this single incident revealed to the schoolboy a human side . '

		These recollec - tions , and others of the same sort in other parts of the book , drop from the writer 's pen with no flourish of self-advertisement or accent of self-complacency .

		` The death of Doctor

		On one occasion , at one of his own dinner-parties , when the ladies had retired and a guest began at once upon that vein of indecent talk , which is , perhaps , less infrequent among educated men in

America	LOCATION	, or is at least more easily tolerated there , Doctor
Jowett	PERSON	is said to have looked sharply toward the offender , and to have said with a decisive polite - ness , `` Shall we continue this conversation in the drawing-room ? ''

		Letters of Mark ' gives us sundry illiterate and otherwise odd and amusing epistolary efforts that the author 's fame as a public character has brought to him in the course of a long lifetime , ' Books Unread ' and ` Butterflies in Poetry ' are dis - quisitions on literary themes .

		That he writes so engagingly and so refreshingly on such topics may be due to the fact that , while he is evidently something of a bookworm , he is altogether free from that disagreeable book - worminess which an exclusive devotion to books often engenders .

		Papers on '

		The portraits and facsimiles are of interest , but are inserted without much apparent system , and sometimes with slight cause .

		For example , a chance reference to
Victor Hugo	PERSON	's observation that the insect world is , with hardly an excep - tion , a world of silence , serves as an excuse for his portrait , which faces the passage in ques - tion .

Russia	LOCATION	.

		* All things Eussian are interesting to the world , now that the inner conditions of the huge empire have been revealed by the light - ning stroke of the Japanese war .

		While a few shrewd observers with exceptional ad - vantages for observation have been able to see below the surface and have told of inefficiency and rottenness , the most of us , even the states - men and students of affairs , have been de - ceived by the superficial show of strength that
Russia	LOCATION	has presented to the world , and she has been courted and deferred to as one of the mighty powers whose vast plans of con - quest and growth must not be interfered with .

		But two short years ago ,
Eussia	LOCATION	seemed to be the destined mistress of the
Far East	LOCATION	and the possessor of a large part of
China	LOCATION	and of whatever else she would have .

		Xow her power has crumbled under the blows of a small despised Oriental power , which in shat - tering the prestige of
Eussia	LOCATION	has also awak - ened
China	LOCATION	to new life .

		the superficial explanations offered by writers untrained in historical and economic investi - gation , or by enthusiasts with one idea .

		The phenomena are too large to be accounted for by such facts , however true , as the weakness of the Tsar and the corruption of the court .

		In the first of the books under consideration we have the results of long years of serious study of Eussian conditions at first hand by a man of ability and training .

		Professor Mil - youkov states his purpose in these Avords : ` This book is not a political pamphlet written for the occasion , but a result of long years of study - devoted to the explanation of the Russian present by the Russian past .

		The present crisis in
Russia	LOCATION	necessarily commands attention , and everything dis - cussed in this work converges to the one aim of explaining this crisis .

		But the conditions that have brought on the crisis are so deeply rooted in the past , and are so closely interwoven with every aspect of Russian life , whether of religion or ot politics , of doctrines or of institutions , of social forms or of the composition of society , that an ex - planation of the present situation , to be at all adequate , must necessarily be a general picture of
Russia	LOCATION	and a general description of the conditions under which its civilization has developed .

		The crisis will pass , but the conditions of civilization remain ; and my ambition has been to explain , not the momentary and the transient , but the perma - nent and the lasting , elements in the political , so - cial , and religious life of
Russia	LOCATION	. '

		The author carries out very satisfactorily the purpose that he had before him , and the book is one that must be studied by anyone who sets out to get a real knowledge of
Russia	LOCATION	.

		The lectures out of which the book has grown were delivered at the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	in
1903	DATE	, before the war began ; and the author has since been called to deliver a course of lectures at the
Lowell Institute	ORGANIZATION	in
Boston	LOCATION	.

		These facts guarantee his scholarly standing .

		The conclusions that he reached before the war he has seen no reason to modify since .

		The book is a substantial and satisfactory piece of work , giving the point of view of that branch of the Eussian liberal party known as the ` Intellectuals , ' the real liberals of the country .

		Professor
Milyoukov	PERSON	's activity in the cause of freedom has already led to exile , but there is nothing in this book of the intemper - ance of the professional agitator or the po - litical enthusiast .

		He possesses an intimate knowledge of his subject , and is fearless in expressing his opinions ; and we feel through the whole discussion that he is sincere and is trying to
Ijo	ORGANIZATION	fair .

		With ample knowledge , , training , and evident fairness , he is the best available guide to a knowledge of present con - ditions in
Eussia	LOCATION	from the historical point of view .

		One of the most interesting chapters for American readers is that in which the author elaborates his comparison between
Russia	LOCATION	and

		THE DIAL 269 the
United States	LOCATION	.

		There are also chapters on the Xationalistic Idea , the
Eeligious Tra	ORGANIZATION	- dition , the Liberal Idea , the Socialistic Idea , the Crisis and the
Urgency of Eeform	ORGANIZATION	, and a brief Conclusion .

		As these chapters run over a hundred pages each , and are solid with sig - nificant facts and reasoning on the facts , it - is manifestly impossible in a brief review to give even the baldest summary of them .

		There is a full analj-tical index , filling twent -RCB- -- five pages , that will be very helpful to the student of Russian conditions and institutions , and six maps in color set forth graphically many facts important to the study of Hussian develop - ment .

		In striking contrast to the weighty and thorough discussion of Russian conditions con - tained in Professor
Milyoukov	PERSON	's book is the superficial and unrestrained declamation of Mr.
Ular	PERSON	in his attempt to account for Rus - sia 's conditions and misfortunes .

		For him there is no historical background , no evolution of the present from the past .

		He says in his preface : * This book is an account of the general conditions prevailing at the outbreak of the Russian Revolution .

		In these the per - sonal action of the Executive -- Tsar , Princes , Ministers , and Generals -- is the capital factor .

		Analysis of this Executive was therefore in - cumbent on me , by juxtaposition of the most typical facts relating to its action . '

		Here we have the author 's theory and method ; and it is easy to see where it will lead us .

		His typical facts are mainly pathological ; he sets before us the whole royal connection for a hundred and fiity years back -- ■ ' the Reigning Dynasty of Degenerates and Fools ' -- as af - flicted with epileptic tendencies which mani - fest themselves in amnesia , mysticism , and cruelty , with megalomania , sexomania , tuber - culosis , morbid religiosit -RCB- - , mental incoherence , and degeneracy .

		This we have through eighty pages , one czar after another and one grand duke after another passing in procession before us .

		The grand villain of the book is
Plehve	LOCATION	, whose assassination is said to have been the opening scene in the Revolution .

		He was the incarnation of cruel repression , the head of a system whose ramifications reached every hamlet and almost every house in the vast empire ; but
Witte	PERSON	, with his financial and economic reforms , and Pobiedonostseff .

		the re - ligious autocrat and reactionist , receive their share of denunciation .

		The final chapter , on the
National Awakening	ORGANIZATION	, runs through the list of petty subject nationalities , showing how in each a new spirit is rising wliich will con - tribute to make irresistible the Revolution that is now upon the empire .

		The book is not ^ vithout value for him who can sift the facts from the fiction and the denunciation ; but it is altogether untrustworthy , and can not but mislead the untrained reader .

		War-time Memories of a Coxfed - ERATE 's Daughter .

		* The title of Mrs.
D. Giraud Wrighfs	PERSON	' A Southern Girl in '61 ' is somewhat misleading , in that it implies a book of reminiscences of
Southern	ORGANIZATION	social life on the eve of the Civil `` War ; whereas we find in the volume little about the * Southern Girl ' and not much about '
' 61	DATE	, ' and only casual glimpses of Confederate home - life .

		However , the omission may well be over - looked , sinc-e the social side of Confederate history has been prettj - well exploited recently by Mrs. Clay and Mrs.
Pryor	PERSON	, and in Mrs.
Chesnufs	PERSON	Diary ; while the volume under re - view has an interest and value that the social histories have not .

		The author , as Miss
Louise Wigfall	PERSON	, was the daughter of
Louis T. Wigfall	PERSON	of
South Carolina	LOCATION	and later of
Texas	LOCATION	, who rep - resented the latter state in the
United States Senate	ORGANIZATION	until secession came , when he was trans - ferred to the
Confederate Senate	ORGANIZATION	.

		He served the Confederacy not only in the legislative halls but also in the field at the head of a brigade of Texans .

		The contents of the volume are surprisingly varied , when one considers that the writer was a seventeen year old school-girl when the war began .

		The account opens with a description of the family life in
Texas	LOCATION	and later in Wash - ington , and of her own school-days in
New England	LOCATION	.

		Then follow character-sketches and descriptions of the prominent Confederate leaders , among them
Davis	PERSON	,
Breckenridge	LOCATION	,
Benjamin	LOCATION	,
Hunter	PERSON	, and
Wigfall	PERSON	.

		Most of the book is made up of the public and private correspondence of Senator
Wigfall	PERSON	and his familv .

		The last chapters describe the life of the author while a member of General
Joe Johnston	PERSON	's household after he was relieved from command at
Atlanta	LOCATION	, and the book closes with a description of the escape of the
Wigfall	PERSON	family from beleaguered
Richmond	LOCATION	, and the slow and painful return to
Texas	LOCATION	.

		The personal experiences of the youthful daughter of Senator

Nov. 1	DATE	, ferent places ; the two writers saw from dif - ferent view-points .

		Through contemporary letters and vivid narration we are given an insight into the feeling at the North in
1861	DATE	, as it appeared to two school-girls from the South lingering unwillingly in a hostile country .

		A thrilling experience was theirs when running the blockade to get into the beleaguered Con - federacy under the folds of the Stars and Bars .

		A touching incident is related to show the affec - tion of
Jefferson Davis	PERSON	for his children and their regard for him .

		Mrs.
Wright	PERSON	's treatment of
Davis	PERSON	is altogether fair , in spite of her father 's violent dislike of the Confederate pres - ident 's policies and plans .

		Another side of
Johnston	ORGANIZATION	's character is revealed in the descrip - tions of life in his family .

		Very little is said about that most fruitful topic -- ^ the privations of the last years of the war ; but under date of
May 3 , 1864	DATE	, there is an amusing note to the effect that ' I am completely unshod , as my boot gave way entirely yesterday in my walk with F. , ' and another note six days later ex - plains that Hhe prices for mending shoes are so exorbitant that I expect I had better wait and have them mended in the country . '

		How she managed meanwhile we are not informed .

		Some of the letters printed are valuable as historical documents .


Wigfall	PERSON	was the confi - dential correspondent and adviser of Beaure - gard , and of
Johnston	LOCATION	, whose most cherished plans were unfolded for his approval and as - sistance .

		In this correspondence
Wigfall	PERSON	is seen in a more favorable light than usual .

		Here he shows his common-sense , and that practical side of his nature which caused people of the time to respect his judgment , and none of that fierce and unreasoning criticism , that ` perni - cious nonsense , ' as some one called it , which was characteristic of his conversation when ex - cited .

		The ` inside ' history of his breach with
Davis	PERSON	is here related , and the documents are given ; and most people will agree that
Wigfall	PERSON	and
Johnston	PERSON	were right .


Johnston	PERSON	's letters in regard to the conduct of Confederate affairs in the West are convincing as to the mistake made by
Davis	PERSON	and liis advisers .

		Incidentally ,
John	PERSON	- ston 's and
Wigfall	PERSON	's disquisitions on the mili - tary aspects of the geographical situation of
Mississippi	LOCATION	and
Tennessee	LOCATION	are very effective .

		The friends of the excessively criticised
General Braxton Bragg	ORGANIZATION	will be pleased at the frank praise of
Bragg	ORGANIZATION	's management expressed in
Johnston	LOCATION	's private letters here published .

		There is a communication from
Alexander H. Ste	PERSON	- phens , dated
February 13 , 1865	DATE	, declaring that the Southern people are still willing and capable of resistance , but that leadership is lacking .

		Stephens favored an appeal to ' all friends of constitutional liberty ' at the North for a settlement in the ' forum of reason . '

		As long as he lived ,
Stephens	PERSON	believed that the war was fought over political and not over less superficial differences .

		The curious and inex - plicable hopefulness of the Southern people is shown in the correspondence of late 1864 and early
1865	DATE	, in regard to the
Atlanta	LOCATION	and Ten - nessee campaigns .

		There is no indication that they knew how badly Hood was losing before
Sherman	PERSON	and
Thomas	PERSON	.

		There is a whole com - mentary in
Wigfall	PERSON	's remark about Senator Hunter of
Virginia	LOCATION	: ' I do n't know what we Southern men would do without Hunter ; he is the only one among us who knows anything about finance . '

		The volume is a fine specimen of the printer 's art in type , paper , and illustrations .

		The lat - ter , about fifty in all , are from contemporary portraits of Confederate statesmen and gener - als , and
Southern	ORGANIZATION	women of the war time .

		The last illustration , of the carpetbag and negro legislature of
South Carolina	LOCATION	, seems entirely out of place , unless it is meant to emphasize the contrast between ' before the war and after . '

1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 271 ing insistency to the American people : ' How do you justify your continuance in the
Phil	LOCATION	- ippines ? '

		and ' What is the character of your conduct there ? '

		The second question can be answered only by presentation of facts ; the first , however answered , must always lie within the field of opinion .

		Toward the discussion of this first question three bodies of opinion have been formed or promulgated in the
United States	LOCATION	within a few years .

		One group of thinkers , who have been in a general way designated as ' anti-imperialists , ' believe that * in the nature of things , no political control can be legitimately exercised by any one set of men over another , and that such control , if permanently assumed , can never avoid the taint of selfishness . '

		A second group , at the other extreme of political ideas , will adopt the utterance of Professor
Burgess	PERSON	, as an interpre - tation of their views : * We must conclude , from the manifest mission of the Teutonic nations , that interference in the affairs of populations not wholly barbaric , which have made some progress in state organization , but which manifest incapacity to solve the prob - lem of political civilization with any degree of completeness , is a justifiable policy .

		The Teutonic nations are the political nations of the modem era ... The duty has fallen to them of organizing the world politically . '

		Undoubtedly , the larger number of the many people in the
United States	LOCATION	for whom Pro- fessor
Burgess	PERSON	may be allowed to speak , would accept , as a proper corollary from their views , that with the duty of organizing other peoples politically there goes the duty of so organizing them as to bring benefit and blessing to the dependent as well as to the ruling race .

		In their eyes , the organizing process well becomes a trust , exercised by the organized for the bene - fit of societ -RCB- ' at large .

		Under the influence , however , of the events as they have marched in the islands since
1898	DATE	, a new edition of imperialistic justification has taken form , and has differentiated a third group of thinkers , well represented by the author of ` The Ethics of Imperialism . '

		Mr.
Carman	PERSON	has small re - spect for those who try to justify our stay in
the Philippines	LOCATION	on any altruistic basis of ' first help to the injured . '

		He will hear naught of Spanish aggression as a cause of our venture over sea , or of good done for anyone else by our continuance therein .

		He says boldly : ` The truth is that the American nation felt the need , commercial ! -RCB- '

		, of
the Philippines	LOCATION	, precisely as
Britain	LOCATION	has long felt the need , commercially , of
India	LOCATION	; and when the fortunes of war made it possible for her to seize the islands without the risk of embroiling any of the other stronger powers , she seized them .

		The Spanish war did not play the .

		part of a provocation , but it brought about an inter - national situation which made the seizure of the islands a safe proceeding . '

		This , in his ethical conception , was also a praiseworthy proceeding ; and he adds a warning , that ` ii a people indulge so freely in pharisaical chat - ter about their '' duty '' toward weaker and more backward peoples that they come to be - Ueve that they are conquering them for the benefit of the conquered , they may be led into undertaking '' duties '' of this kind which will prove to be burdens . '

		Apparently in this lat - ter contingency only could matter for reproach be found .

		Mr.
Carman	PERSON	arrives at an ethical satisfaction in these conclusions through a system of ethics which is his own .

		He sets up the ` ethics of egoism ' over against so-called Christian ethics , which he identifies with a foolish and suicidal Altruism .

		He finds no progress , for the indi - vidual or for the community , except in an egoism which at best can only be called a rea - sonable selfishness .

		All that a man may do for wife or child or neighbor or country is done because it conduces to his own advance - ment , or at most , to his own pleasure .

		All the sources of action which have ever ennobled the world are , by this frank apostle of Self , pol - luted and poisoned .

		` Whatever is is right ' is more humanly if less humanely read anew , ' whatever succeeds is right . ' '

		It seems hardly necessar -RCB- - , ' he says , ' to point out that the more unselfish virtues -- such as justice , honesty , truth , fair play , self-restraint from passions which might injure others as well as one 's self -- are as certainly egoistic .

		A man stands a better chance of getting and keeping wealth in a community which is honest than in one which is not ; everybody benefits by justice , truth , fair play , and mutual self-restraint . '

		The conduct of a man who practises justice , truth , and fair play , in a community where the majority do otherwise , does not seem to be accounted for by this peculiar ethical system , although it might justify all the evils of suc - cessful imperialism .

		Mr.
Willis	PERSON	, the author of ` Our Philippine Problem , ' entitles himself ` sometime
Armour	PERSON	-
Crane	PERSON	travelling feUow in the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, ' although he does not indicate that he was such at the time of the investigations which are the basis for his book .

		This essay is a scathing impeachment of the conduct of the government of the
United States	LOCATION	and its employees in
the Philippines	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Willis	PERSON	some - what prejudices his case as an impartial critic by the expression of his own adverse opinion in the preliminary chapter , before he has pre - sented his evidence to his readers .

		He would 272 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, have made the impression he desires to make more readily had he not thus violated a rule as good in book-making as in oratory .

		He has gone no further than page sixteen , when he makes the assertion -- which he never takes up again : ' Experienced colonial administrators like Sir
Andrew Clarke	PERSON	pointed the way to a pacific settlement of the difficulty through the establishment of a protectorate with native rulers advised by able and upright Americans ; but such counsels were brushed aside .

		War was wanted : war enough , in the later words of President
Roosevelt	PERSON	at
Sea Girt	LOCATION	,
N. J.	PERSON	, to go around . '

		Mr.
Willis	PERSON	gives , apparently , careful studies of the civil service , local government , the ju - dicial system , the constabulary , the church , ed - ucation , business , agricultural and social con - ditions , and economic legislation .

		In no one of the fields does he speak encouragingly ; in most of them he depicts a black picture .

		The chapter on control of public opinion , in its representation of a muzzled press and judic - iary , is only less hideous than the terrible survey of the system of supervised prostitution .

		As one turns these pages , he wonders whether he is reading about occurences in the daily life of a people in the
twentieth century	DATE	, or whether , unawares , he has picked up some treatise on the Venetian or Florentine life in the age of
Machiavelli	ORGANIZATION	and the despots .

		No modem government has ever been more se - verely impeached of high crimes and misde - meanors against the spirit of the institutions of its people , than has the government at
Washington	LOCATION	in these chapters .

		The book can - not be ignored by those who love our institu - tions , nor indeed by those who administer them for us today .

Coutts	PERSON	acliieves strength , although often at the sacrifice of the gracious charm which we are wont to demand of a poet .

		We may il - lustrate tliis statement by his sonnet-commen - tary upon a text found in the ' Osservatore Eomano ' at the time of the
Dreyfus	ORGANIZATION	trial . '

		Oblivious of infinity , -- interred As in a chrysalis of scanty scope .

		In this small world , where he must grovel and grope , -- Is Man more tragical or more absurd ?

		Consider that abominable word Just uttered by the Journal of the Pope : '' A Jew accused of treason must not hope For sympathy from us . ''

		Have they not heard That story of the Jew of
Galilee	LOCATION	, Who suffered crucifixion for the blame Of treason and the sin of heresy ?

		And lit they not the faggot 's frequent flame .

		To prove their perfect Catholicity By burning those outside it , in his name ? '

		This attitude of intellectual challenge is char - acteristic of the entire volume , and it is such touches of sceva indignatio that give the author 's work its most distinctive quality .

		Mrs.
Hubert Bland	PERSON	-LRB- E. Xesbit -RRB- is no ama - teur of verse , and her work always pleases .

		It reaches about the level of
Jean Ingelow	ORGANIZATION	's thought and sentiment , but never quite achieves the distinction of
Christina Eossetti	PERSON	.

		Her latest volume , ' The Rainbow and the Rose , ' yields us these pretty stanzas , entitled ' En Tout Cas ' : * When I am glad I need your eyes To be the stars of Paradise ; Your lips to be the seal of all The joy life grants , and dreams recall ; Your hand , to lie my hands between What time we walk the garden green .

		` But most in grief I need your face To lean to mine in the desert place ; Your lips to mock the evil years .

		To sweeten me my cup of tears .

		274 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, It takes a well-nigh perfect ear for music to write such verse as this .

		And how these Irish poets love to ring the changes on light and shadow , color and sound , birds and flowers and trees !

		Father
Sheehan	PERSON	aptly says of this book that it offers ' the antithesis of every art that may be called Tennysonian / and we may well be glad that it is so spontaneous and unaffected , so free from bookishness and imitative endeavor .

		Mr.
John Vance Cheney	PERSON	has been known to the public for many years as one of our most delicate lyrists .

		Nearly every magazine of consequence has had him for a contrib - utor , and he has put forth several small col - lections of his verse .

		He has now brought together in a single volume of ' Poems ' all of his work that he wishes to preserve , and thereby made it possible to form a just es - timate of his total achievement .

		It is a lim - ited achievement , no doubt , for few of the pieces extend beyond a single page , and many of them are but the briefest bits of song .

		The only exception to this general rule is offered by the dramatic idyl at the close of the book , MVhen Love Was Lord , ' which serves chiefly to emphasize the fact that the poet is most truly himself when he is con - tent to be a maker of cameos .

		Nor is there a very deep note of passion sounded in his song .

		His lyrics are of acceptance , coupled only with the gentlest and most apologetic sort of questioning .

		When nature is his theme , there is rarely any questioning at all , but merely the penetrative gaze and the loving communion .

		The very soul of ` Twi - light , ' for example , the very heart of its mys - tery , is in these lines : ' Hid ways have winds that lightly shake The silver willows , half-awake , Mysterious paths the moonbeams take Across the shadowed mountain-lake ; The soul in deeper secret goes Behind the lilac and the rose In skies of evening , far away .

		Beyond the flight of
night	TIME	and day . '

		Mr.
Cheney	PERSON	is often felicitous in the simple quatrain of gnomic content : ' Wouldst hear the singing of the spheres .

		Hark with closed ears ; Wouldst follow Beauty to her skies .

		Look with closed eyes . '

		His philosophy of life -- ^ not the deepest , perhaps , but true as far as it goes , -- is ex - pressed in ' The Happiest Heart . ' '

		Who drives the horses of the sun Shall lord it but a day ; Better the lowly deed were done , And kept the humble way . '

		The rust will find the sword of fame , s .

		The dust will hide the crown ; Ay , none shall nail so high his name
Time	ORGANIZATION	will not tear it down . '

		The happiest heart that ever beat Was in some quiet breast That found the common daylight sweet , And left to Heaven the rest . '

		Sometimes a pleasant conceit is expressed with engaging naivete , as in the verses ` At Candle - Lighting . ' '

		I think it better to believe .

		And become as the children , they The children of the early day .

		Who let the kindly dream deceive .

		And joyed in all the mind may weave Of dear conceit -- better , I say .

		To let wild fancy have her way , To trust her than to know and grieve .

		A poet of old Colophon A notion held I think was right , No matter how or where he gat it ; The stars are snuffed out every daicn , And newly lighted every night .

		I hope to catch the angels at it .

		The traits that we have found space to illus - trate , and others that must go unmentioned , should endear the author to us , at least m our less strenuous moods .

		They are traits that constantly suggest the artless method and the appealing voice of
Emerson	LOCATION	, to whose memory it was peculiarlv fitting that the author should have inscribed `` this beautiful and sympathetic sonnet : '
Plato	PERSON	come back to turn a Yankee phrase ,
Franklin	PERSON	recalled to lord the world of soul -- So came he , so he journeyed , sane and whole ,
The Concord	ORGANIZATION	pilgrim on the upper ways .

		Born to her lap , his heart was ever
May	DATE	's , In vernal terms he read to us the scroll Of time ; he chanted from the magic roll ; We knew the joy and beauty of the days .

		He read to us until his sight grew dim -- Blinded with brightness from beyond the sun -- Then followed he the glory from afar .

		But not until a race had learned of him The murmurs of eternity that run ^ Through human hearts , the blossom and the star .

		According to the title-page of his ` Poems , ' Mr.
Alexander Francis Chamberlain	PERSON	is a doc - tor of philosophy , a professor of anthropology , and a member of various learned societies .

		But these ominous facts should not be counted heavily against him .

		since his verse is of pleas - ing qualitv , and inspired by fine ideals .

		We qu'ote what seems to us the best of his son - nets . '

		Two men , at least , earth holds , not less than heaven .

		Immortal , -- Jesus ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		Saxon , Jew , Alike these conquer race and clime , are given Enduring mastery over old and new .

		One chose in all men 's hearts to be eu.shrined .

		So death might pass , and hate be lost in love .

		The other , templed in the human mind .

		Drew life and death , all acts and thoughts that move .

		They stand alone , but not from us disjoined , Or from each other .

		They are kith and kin Of all mankind .

		The wit , the love they coined Came from the common ore where all begin .

		That English brain , that heart in
Palestine	LOCATION	, Grew not less human , as they grew divine . '

		A sonnet seems to be the best selection we can make from the sonnets , lyrics , and quat - rains that make up Mr.
Frederic Fairchild Sherman	PERSON	's ' Dav Dream and Even Song . '

		THE DTATi 275 • Sweeter than any earthly dawn is this .

		The morning of our love , when her fond eyes Open like little flowers of Paradise And fill the garden place of dreams with bliss .

		No glory of the daybreak do I miss -- Blushes that rival daybreak 's rosy skies , -- Smiles that are sunshine laughing in disguise , -- And all the sweets of
summer	DATE	in her kiss .

		Her hair is like a golden mist above The snowy bosom , that unfathomed sea .

		The undercurrent and the tide whereof Are but the yearning of her heart for m `` ; And in the lyric whisper of her love There is a murmur of eternity . '

		This is extremely pretty in the conventional way , and there are a dozen others as good , to say nothing of the lyrics or of the really fine ode at the close of the volume .

		The poetic-al work of Miss
Amanda T. Jones	PERSON	has been for many years familiar to those who have explored the byways of Amer - ican literary production , and they have al - ways felt that it deserved a wider recognition than has thus far been accorded to it .

		Now , after a long silence .

		Miss
Jones	PERSON	has put forth a new volume of poems , which may perhaps secure for her work something of the appre - ciation which has long been its due .

		The new book is entitled ` Rubaiyat of
Solomon	LOCATION	, and Other Poems . '

		The first third of its con - Poems , ' and speaks of the author as ' dream - tents is given up to a versification , in the familiar rubaiyat form , of certain of the say - ings of Solomon and
Koheleth	PERSON	.

		The follow - ing is a typical example : ' Better is grief than feasting : Go thy way Unto the house of mourning , -- there survey The end of all mankind : for it is well The living to his heart this truth should lay . '

		Sorrow cxcelleth laughter : None may tell What hour he also with the dead must dwell .

		By sadness of the countenance , the heart Is turned to God that did from Him rebel . '

		The wise man chooseth still the better part .

		But if , within the house of mirth , thou art Among the fools better than song shall be The wise rebuke that woundeth as a dart . '

		As crackling thorns , under the pot , set free Their sparks that straightway into darkness flee .

		Even so the laughter of the fool doth start ; And all his works with vanity agree . ''

		There are some fifty pages of this sort of paraphrase , but we can not help regarding the effort as a mistaken one .

		The consecrated words do not gain in either dignity or beauty ; in fact , they lose very distinctly , and all such attempts must be essentially of the lineage of Sternhold and Hopkips , or of the Bay Psalm Book .

		It is elsewhere in
Miss Jones	LOCATION	's volume that we must look for her most meritorious verse .

		We find it , for example , in the group of ' Kansas Bird Songs , ' in the lyrics of childhood , the tender personal tributes , and the pieces that touch on contemporary his - tory .

		We can not do better than quote from the poem called '
Panama	LOCATION	' -LRB- home of the dove-plant , or Holy Ghost flower -RRB- . '

		What time the Lord drew back the sea And gave thee room , slight
Panama	LOCATION	, '' I will not have thee great , '' said He , But thou Shalt bear the slender key Of both the gates I builded Me And all the great shall come to thee 5 ` or leave to pass , O ,

		Nor heed us , sobbing by the strand ?

		Set wide thy gates on either hand .

		That we may search through saltless sand .

		-LSB- Flower of the deep-embosomed dove , So should His mighty nations love li Commenting about six years ago upon Miss
Helen Hay	PERSON	's first volume of verse , we spoke of its evidence of * poetic sensibility and the artistic conscience . '

		The author -LRB- now Mrs.
Whitney	PERSON	-RRB- has produced a second volume which justifies a repetition , and even an emphasis , of this characterization .

		Here are thirty son - nets and rather more than that number of songs , every one of which is a finished bit of art .

		The work is of so even an excellence that it offers little room for choice .

		The first of the sonnets -- ' Ave atque Vale ' -- is as good as any of those that come after , and how good it is we will make clear by quota - tion . '

		As a blown leaf across the face of Time Your name falls emptily upon my heart .

		In this new symmetry you have no part .

		No lot in my fair life .

		The stars still chime
Autumn	DATE	and
Spring	DATE	in ceaseless pantomine .

		I play with
Beauty	ORGANIZATION	, which is kin to Art ,
Forgetting Nature	ORGANIZATION	.

		Nor do pulses start To hear your soul remembered in a rhyme .

		You may not vex me any more .

		The stark Terror of life has passed , and all the stress .

		Winds had their will of me , and now caress .

		Blown from bland groves I know .

		Time dreams , and I , As on a mirror , see the days go by In nonchalant procession to the dark . '

		The note of grave melancholy thus struck at the outset is maintained in all the pages that follow , for the ` deep , unuttered sadness in the world ' is the constant burden of Mrs.
Whitney	PERSON	's song .

		Even the lyrics are rarely lyrics of joy , and when they seem to be such , it is a subdued joy , chastened by some reflec - tion upon the transitoriness of human happi - ness .

		Yet the sadness of the poet does not bring forth blind despair ; it rather spurs the spirit on to nobler endeavor , ' Fight , though the bulwarks of your faith may fall .

		Life become gray and full of weariness , Love prove a lie and wisdom bitterness -- Fight , for the strife alone avails for all . '

		Fight and fight on , exalting in the light .

		Standing alert and upright gleefully ^ Seizing life 's joys and woes courageously , Man to the end , and Master -- laugh and fight . '

		` With the ` exception of a body of familiar letters now itt process of collection , ' says this editor , ` the present volume contains all of Heai'u 's writing that he left uncollected in the magazines or in manuscript of a sufficient ripeness for publica - tion . '

		The exquisite art of
Hearn	ORGANIZATION	's pen stamps < tiie little book as a notable one ; and , curiously `` enough , the chapter on ` Ultimate Questions , ' sug - gested by
Spencer	PERSON	's essay thus entitled , and left by the author in what he regarded as an unfin - ished condition , is the best and most character - istic portion of the collection .

		In this paper , as Mr.
Greenslet Avrites	PERSON	, ` which sti * ikes , so to say , the dominant chord of this volume , we have an almost lyrical expression of the meaning for him of the Spencerian philosophy and psychology .

		In it is his characteristic mingling of Buddhist and Shinto thought with English and French psy - t ` hology , strains which in his work `` do not sim - ply mix well , '' as he says in one of his letters , but `` absolutely unite , like chemical elements , -- rush together with a shock ; '' -- and in it he strikes his deepest note .

		In his steady envisage - ment of the horror that envelopes the stupendous universe of science , in his power to evoke and revive old myths and supei ` stitions , and by their glamour to cast a ghostly light of vanished suns over the darkness of the abyss , he Avas the most Lucretian of modern writers . '

		The first two chap - ters deal with matters of Japanese folk-lore and poetry , many of the peculiar five-line poems being given , Avith prose translations and numerous ex - planatory footnotes .

		The closing selection is a highly interesting ` Letter from
Japan	LOCATION	, ' dated
August	DATE	I ,
1904	DATE	, and treating of the Avar then in progress , and of the calm , confident , even joy - ful bearing of the people at home .

		A short ac - count of a gruesome AVest Indian incident , and two Japanese stories of the Aveird and ghostly order , make up the rest of the book .

		In the light of recent events ,
Avhich	PERSON	tend to prove that
Japan	LOCATION	can more calmly face OA ^ erAvhelming disas - ters than minor annoyances , the following is of interest : ` Were
Kuropatkin	PERSON	able to fulfil his rash threat of invading
Japan	LOCATION	, ' says
Hearn	PERSON	, ` the nation Avould probably rise as one man .

		But otherwise the knowledge of any great disaster Avonld be bravely borne .

		From time unknoAvn ,
Japan	LOCATION	has been a land of cataclysms , -- earth - quakes that ruin cities in the space of a moment ; tidal Avaves , tAvo hundred miles long , sweeping Avhole coast populations out of existence ; floods submerging hundreds of leagues of Avell-tilled fields ; eruptions burying provinces .

		Calamities like this haA'e disciplined the race in resignation and in patience ; and it has been Avell trained also to bear Avith courage all the misfortunes of war .

		Even by the foreign peoples that have been most closely in contact with her , the eai ^ acities of
Japan	LOCATION	remain unguessed .

		Perhaps her poAver to resist aggression is far surpassed by her power to endure . '

		The Far East Mr.
Archibald Little	PERSON	's ` The Far geographically East ' -LRB-
Oxford Clarendon Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- considered .

		ig the kind of book of which there has been genuine need for some time .

		It furnishes , instead of the familiar speculations about oriental competition or the possibilities of Avestern struggle for the partition of
China	LOCATION	, a geographical study of the various political divi - sions of the extreme Orient .

		There is small treat - ment of actual commerce , or of immediate com - mercial prospects in the narroAv sense , anywhere in the volume .

		In a A'ery important Avay , how - eA-er , the book will furnish aid to the student of commerce , since it estimates the fundamental re - sources , and , quite as important , the distribution of the water-AA ` ays and possible trade-ioutes of the
Chinese Empire	ORGANIZATION	and its dependencies and neighbors .

		Here and there , brief historical sum - maries supply a background for the discussion of the px ` obable political and commercial relations of the future .

		There is much that must be of A'alue to students of possible militarv campaigns , and more that Avill serA'e to inform the intelligent business man
Avho	ORGANIZATION	is studying the possibilities of scientific trade expansion .

		While Mr.
Little	PERSON	's Avork is thus primarily geographical and geolog - ical , its political features being purely incidental , it is not written in a style that ought to repel any serious reader , even though he may not be a student of science in the narroAv sense of that tei-m .

		The A'olume is certainly not popular , yet it has a quality of interest that AA'ill commend it for very general reading .

		A feature of the book worthy of special praise is the numerous maps , which show both geographical and physiographical relations .

		They have e \ idently been selected with great care , particularly those which indicate the dis - tribution of mineral products .

		A few photo - graphs , none of which seems familiar and all of which are enlightening , appear in the book .

		Mr.
Little	PERSON	's work is one that should be especially ac - ceptable in view of the general interest , and equally general lack of accurate information , with reference to the Far East which just now pre - vails in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		A aciioiariy The better acquaintance that the essayist 's reader gains with Mr.
Paul Elmer	PERSON	latest Kork .

		More , as the successive volumes of ` Shelburne Essays ' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- make their ap - pearance , is not the least part of the pleasure they bestow .

		In the
Third Series	ORGANIZATION	, just issued , an emphasis that speaks of personal experience and conviction is more than once placed on the unreality of things commonly held to be real , and on the permanence and substantiality of the ideal .

		* Only , perhaps ' the author declares , ' when the hope of love ... and the visions of ambition , the belief in pleasure and the luxury of grief , have lost their sting , do we turn to books with the contented understajiding that the shadow is the reality , and the seeming reality of things is the shadow . '

		There is a ring , too , of personal reminiscence in what is said of the significance to literary art of disappointed love in the literary artist .

		Denied the happiness of living his love-stoiy , the poet is forced to i-ealize it in his verse .

		These later essays , especially that on
Sterne	PERSON	, betray a fine appreciation of humor which the earlier pieces had hardly led one to expect .

		But from indulgence in humor on his own part , the essayist , with a not impraise - worthy restraint , still refrains , except rarely and in a very quiet way .

		Chapters on
Whittier	LOCATION	,
Browning	PERSON	, and
Swinburne	PERSON	show Mr. More to be a warm lover of the
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	poet , a less ardent admirer of
Browning	PERSON	, whom he regards as a ' false prophet , ' and not at all enthusiastic over
Swin	LOCATION	- burne .

		Whittier 's `
Pennsylvania Pilgrim	ORGANIZATION	' strikes him as possessing peculiar beauty , and as ` quite the most characteristic of his works . '

		Yet he fails to find in the poet 's critics and biographers any confirmation of this judgment , and is only reassured by some words of praise from Whit - tier 's own pen -- hardly the most authoritative source .

		The reason of this ` conspiracy of silence , ' as the essa ^ - ist calls it , is not so unapparent as he seems to think .

		The three-line stanza , each line ending in the same rhyme , is awkward , and is largely responsible for many forced and faulty rhj-mes .

		The rhythm , too , is in places anything but musical .

		Finally , the poem , one of
Whittier	LOCATION	's longest , is too long ; that is , it suffers in com - parison with the poet 's gems of song , which , ex - cept ` Snowbound , ' are all much shorter .

		Mr.
More	PERSON	shows himself to be still unreconciled to
Xew England	LOCATION	transcendentalism .

		To him , the iron string so magnificently twanged by
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	gives forth a false note .

		This ` spirit of self - dependence , ' he asserts , ` was dangerous at the best . '

		Besides the above-indicated subjects , the book treats of
Cowper	PERSON	, Sainte-Beuve ,
Scott	PERSON	's novels ,
Christina Rossetti	PERSON	, ` Don Juan , '
Short	PERSON	- house , and ` The Quest of a Century . '

		The quest is for peace , and the author 's closing paragraph , too long for quotation here , is especially com - mended to the reader 's attention .

		A new life The mediaeval biography is one of of
Ireland	LOCATION	's the most Untrustworthy forms of patron saint .

		historic literature .

		Particularly is this true when the subject is one of the earlier saints .

		Frequently the personal histories of these men are so completely overlaid with legend that it is almost impossible to obtain even a glimpse of the individual as he really was .

		Perhaps this is truer of Saint
Patrick	PERSON	than of any of the other great Christian heroes of the middle ages .

		Pro- fessor Bury , of
Cambridge	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	, has recently undertaken to separate the mythical from the actual , and reveal to us the real
Patrick	PERSON	.

		His ` life of St.
Patrick	PERSON	' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a book of about four hundred pages , nearly half of which are devoted to a critical examination of the sources .

		According to this learned historian ,
Pat	PERSON	- rick was bom about the year 389 , somewhere in southwestern
Britain	LOCATION	, perhaps in
Wales	LOCATION	.

		At the age of sixteen , he was carried as a captive into northern Connaught -LRB- not into
Ulster	LOCATION	, as some have maintained -RRB- ; but a few years later he es - caped to
Graul	PERSON	, whence he was taken to
Italy	LOCATION	.

		After a time he found his way back to
Britain	LOCATION	; but soon the conviction came to him that he was chosen to preach the Gospel in the land of his captivity , and he returned to
Gaul	PERSON	to prepare himself for the Christian ministry .

		In 432 he was consecrated bishop , and proceeded to his chosen field .

		He was then probably forty-three years old .

		For nearly twenty years he worked among the Irish , his death occurring on the sev - enteenth of
March	DATE	, 461 .

		Most of his work was done in the northern part of the island , but he was active also in other parts .

		Patrick was not the first to plant the standards of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	in
Ireland	LOCATION	, nor was he the first bishop of the Irish Church , Palladius having served a year before him ; but the real growth of Christianity in those regions dates from his arrival , and the organiza - tion of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	in
Ireland	LOCATION	was largely Ms work .

		The popular conception of
Patrick	PERSON	's char - acter , the present biographer finds to be utterly false ; with the hero-saint of Celtic legend ` who curses men and even inanimate things which incur his displeasure , ' he has nothing in comjnon but a name .

		His writings reveal a strong personality , an intensely spiritual nature , a resolute char - acter , an imbending will , and an energetic man - hood .

		In learning he was very deficient , but he possessed in great measure those ` practical qualities most essential for carrying through the task which he undertook in the belief that he had been divinely inspired to fulfil it . '

		Perhaps some readers will regret that Professor Bury has found it necessary to reject so much picturesque 278 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, material , but students of the middle ages are likely to agree that in writing this biography the author has done a real service to the cause of Irish history .

		A group ` The Fern Allies ' is the title of a of humble handsome book recently published floral friends .

		by the
Stokes Company	ORGANIZATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, for Mr.
Willard N. Clute	PERSON	, the author .

		Mr.
Clute	PERSON	is Instructor in Botany in the
Joliet	LOCATION	town - ship high-school , and has been long known as an enthusiastic student of Ferns , The fern allies include a variety of small and generally unno - ticed plants whose principal interest lies in the fact that they are kin to the ferns , and in the further fact that they are in a general way the meagre remnants of an earlier wide-spread majes - tic flora , namely , that of the age of coal .

		The little club-mosses that run among the trees and carpet the ground in some of our undisturbed northern woods , pretty green plants sending aloft yellowish spikes dusty with golden spores in their season , are probably the most familiar of the series , siuae in these later sentimental days they are gathered from the woods and heaths in thou - sands , packed in barrels and sent to every hamlet and town , in an effort to make Christmas green .

		Hardly less familiar , however , are the old scour - ing-rushes of meadow and farm , -- the ` joint - grasses ' of childhood memory : strange , clean stems that could be plucked apart and reunited as one walked to school , much as were the youth - ful loves and friendships of those days .

		These queer old plants , less than a hundred species of them in all -LRB- and that means in all North Amer - ica -RRB- , Mr.
Clute	PERSON	has gathered for us , drawn every one , and presented by a very complete descrip - tion in each case , so that , as he says , even the novice should now be able to name and know the little specimens as they are collected or encountered .

		Eight colored plates , some of them more than usually life-like , contribute to the book 's attractiveness .

		The style of the author is generally adapted to the purpose in view , but is sometimes diffuse and sometimes not clear , ` Insolation , ' on page 145 , will not be understood .

		The book is a valuable addition to our literature of less-known American plants , and will no doubt contribute to the wider information of our people in a direction in which as intelligent men and women we have yet much to learn , much to enjoy .

Siena	LOCATION	had that rarest of all gifts , the power to enter thoroughly into the consciousness of other people .

		Her ` love for souls ' was no cold illum - ination , but a warm understanding of and ten - derness for actual men and women .

		Accordingly , in these letters we find her writing to prisoners and outcasts ; to great nobles and plain business men ; to physicians , laAvyers , soldiers of fortune ; to kings and queens and cardinals and popes ; to recluses pursuing the
Beatific Vision	ORGANIZATION	, and to men and women of the world plunged in the lusts of the flesh and governed by the pride of life .

		This great adaptability , joined to the most out - spoken fearlessness , gives to her letters a vitality that still tingles through them after the lapse of centuries .

		In one sense , her life might be counted a failure , since all her tears and efforts failed to accomplish that reform and purification of the Church for which she prayed and labored unceas - ingly .

		Those whom she loved best disappointed her ideal .

		She witnessed iniquity in high religious places , violence and corruption enlisted in the defense of truth .

		Outwardly , all around her was confusion ; but her own life was rounded into a harmonious whole .

		To read the expression of that life in her letters is to follow one of those tragedies that are yet the salvation of the world .

		An early It was to be presumed that the American bulk of the historical material Indian u-ar .

		collected in
Madison	LOCATION	,
Wisconsin	LOCATION	, by Mr , L. C ,
Draper	PERSON	during the thirty odd years of his administration as Secretary of the Wis - consin Historical Society , had heretofore appeared in print .

		Scarcely a book or article has been written on trans-Alleghenian history during sev - eral decades past which has not drawn largely from this storehouse .

		Yet the present Secretary of the Society , in the preface to a `
Documentary History of Lord Dunmore	ORGANIZATION	's War , ' says that this is the first considerable publication from that collection of manuscripts , and that it exhibits the character and scope of the remarkable store of material yet unpublished .

		The volume of nearly 500 pages is issued by the
Wisconsin Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	, from funds supplied by the Sons of the American Revolution of that
State	ORGANIZATION	, It includes public records , private letters , muster-rolls , jour - nals , and official reports , covering the year
1774	DATE	, and forming a source history of the campaign waged by Lord
Dunmore	PERSON	of
Virginia	LOCATION	on the Shawnese and other Indians of the upper
Ohio	LOCATION	, of which the battle of Point Pleasant was the culminating feature .

		The documents are printed in their original forms , and the annotating is full and luminous .

		The work is a significant addition to the best products of American scholarship .

		A handbook of Warm praise must be accorded to arts and crafts Mr.
Stewart Dick	PERSON	's ` Arts and of Old
Japan	LOCATION	.

		THE DIAL .

		279 fifty-three pages , the author tells just the things the beginner needs to know and can not readily get at elsewhere without considerable research .

		These are set forth clearly and intelligently .

		Furthermore , the reader is spwred the sentimental nonsense too often indulged in bj ' writers on this topic .

		Though the book is not the product of much original investigation , it is free from seri - ous eri-or , and it is apparent that the author 's appreciation of the works of art produced in
Japan	LOCATION	is well-informed and discriminating .

		The principal collections owned in
England	LOCATION	, he seems to have studied with care .

		Those in
France	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	, and
America	LOCATION	, though of greater im - pox ` tance .

		are not mentioned ; presumably he is not familiar with them .

		To this , and to having followed too closely the writings of Strange and others , some regi-ettable omissions and defects in proportion may be attributed .

		For instance , in the chapter on color printing , To3 ` okuni is given more than a page , whereas
Kiyonaga	PERSON	, a much greater ai 't ist .

		though comparatively unknown in
England	LOCATION	, is accorded but eight lines of faint praise .

		Exception may be taken also to various statements here and there , such as that most of
Harunobu	LOCATION	's prints contain but a single figure .

		But shortcomings of this kind are few .

		The half - tone illustrations , which are from objects in English collections , serve their purpose suffici - ently , though it can hardly be said that thej ' con - vey an adequate idea of the charm of the works reproduced .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		` Civics : Studies in American Citizenship ' , by Mr.
Waldo H. Shemian	PERSON	, is a new text book , highly practical in its bearings , published by the
Macmii	PERSON	- ian

		This gifted exponent of the A ^ edanta philosophy visited
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	some two years ago , and at - tracted much attention .

		In connection with an English house ,

Burns	PERSON	and

Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's
Cromwell	PERSON	, and
Miss Strickland	LOCATION	's Queen
Elizabeth	PERSON	.

		Xew notes and an index have been added in each case , and in three of the four volumes the original text has been abridged to meet the requirements of the present-day hurried reader .

		The series of dictionaries published by
Messrs. Laird & Lee	ORGANIZATION	has had conferred upon it the distinc - tion of a gold medal award from the
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark Centennial Exposition	ORGANIZATION	.

		A single-volume reprint of the ` Letters and Ad - dresses of
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	' will form an early addition to the ` Unit Books . '

		This excellent series is now issued by the
Unit Book Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	, suc - cessors to Mr.
Howard Wilford BeU	PERSON	.

		The forthcoming biography of
Kate Greenaway	PERSON	by Messrs.

Buskin	PERSON	to Miss
Greenaway	PERSON	.

		Two important volumes of essays announced by Messrs.
Bell	PERSON	of
London	LOCATION	are Mr.
Walter Crane	PERSON	's ` Ideals in Art ' and Mr.
J. Churton Collins	PERSON	's ` Studies in Poetry and Criticism . '

		It it to be hoped that both books may find their way to this country .

		A volume of lectures by Mr.
J. G. Frazer	PERSON	, the author of that remarkable book ` The Golden Bough , ' is announced by Messrs.
Macmillan	PERSON	.

		They deal with the early history of kingship as an insti - tution , and they sketch a general theory of its evolution .

		The authorized English translation of Mr.
Louis	PERSON	iSb ^ 's ` La Vie Future ' has been secured for publi - cation in this country by
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		This work , first issued in
Paris	LOCATION	a few months ago , has aroused a great deal of discussion in sci - entific and religious circles throughout
France	LOCATION	. '

		The Bitter Cry of the Children ' is the title of a book bj ' Mr.
John Spargo	PERSON	, which the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	will publish in a few weeks , with an introduc - tion by Mr.
Robert Hunter	PERSON	.

		The volume is a searching examination of the effects of poverty upon children .

		Two important reference works for collectors to be published immediately by Mr.
Elliot Stock	PERSON	of
London	LOCATION	are the nineteenth annual volume of ` Book Prices Current ' and the second year 's issue of Mr.
George East	PERSON	's ` Collector 's Annual . '

		The last - named work is a record of the year 's auction sales of art objects other than books .

		The one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the birth of
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	was celebrated recently in the poet 's home town of
Aldeburgh	LOCATION	.

		The features of the occasion were an exhibition of manuscripts and personal relics of the poet , addresses by Mr.
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	, Mr.
Clement K. Shorter	PERSON	, and others , and a series of tahleatii vivants illustrative of cer - tain incidents in
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	's life .

		Three interesting
Wordsworth	PERSON	books are an - nounced by Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	.

		The first is ` Poems and Extracts , chosen by
William Wordsworth	PERSON	' for an album presented to Lady
Mary Lowther	PERSON	,
Christ	LOCATION	- mas ,
1819	DATE	.

		It is printed literally from the original , with facsimiles , and has an introduction by Pro- fessor
H. Littledale	PERSON	, and a preface by Mr.
J. Rogers Rees	PERSON	.

		Another is `
Wordsworth	PERSON	's Literary Criti - cism in Prose , ' with an introduction by Mr.
Nowell C. Smith	PERSON	; and the third , `
Wordsworth	PERSON	's Guide to the Lakes , ' with an introduction by Mr.
E. de Selincourt	PERSON	.

		280 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, A complete and carefully collated edition of Coo - per 's Poems , edited by Mr.
H. S. Milford	PERSON	, will soon be added by Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	to his Oxford edi - tions of the poets .

		Mr.
Frowde	PERSON	has lately taken over the ` World 's Classics , ' formerly issued by Mr.
Grant Richards	PERSON	, and is making arrangements to add a number of new volumes to the series .

		Tte publication of Mr.
Herbert Paul	PERSON	's
Life of Froudc	ORGANIZATION	has been postponed for a few weeks , as the author received at the last moment permission to include a collection of letters which will add con - siderably to the interest of the work .

		Mr.
Froude	PERSON	`` s family have given Mr.
Paul	PERSON	access to valuable bio - graphical material in their possession , and the life may therefore be considered authoritative .

		The volume of ` New Collected Rhymes ' by Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	, which Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	will publish this Fall , contains three ballads , of which two at least -- * The
Young Ruthven	PERSON	' and ' The Queen of
Spain	LOCATION	' -- were written in competition with the street minstrels of the close of the sixteenth century ; ` Cricket Rhymes , ' ` Jubilee Poems , ' ` Loyal Lyrics , ' and a number of verses which are described as ` Critical of Life , Art , and Literature . '

		The publishers of ` Scribner 's Magazine ' have issued an attractive pamphlet embodying a sum - mary of the most important contents of that peri - odical since its commencement in
1887	DATE	, with numer - ous reproductions of noteworthy illustrations that have appeared in its pages .

		This pamphlet is well worth possessing for its own sake , but is particu - larly interesting as emphasizing the high literary and artistic standards that have always character - ized this sterling magazine .

		Popular interest in all that pertains to
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	is decidedly on the increase , if the plans of publishers may be taken as an indication .

		We have already mentioned in these pages the elab - orate ten-volume edition of
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's writings which Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	have in active preparation , and also the important revision of Hay and
Nico	PERSON	- lay 's work to be issued by the
F. D. Tandy Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

Helen Nicolay	PERSON	, a daughter of the President 's secretary , which will occupy a foremost place ii ; the forthcoming issues of ` St.

Life of Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	, ' just published by
Messrs. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		BRIEFER MENTION 314 NOTES 315 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 315 THE LITERARY MART .

		The leading feature of ' The
Atlantic Month	LOCATION	- ly ' for Xovember is an article upon ' The Com - mercialization of Literature / by the veteran publisher , Mr.
Henry Holt	PERSON	.

		It is , in form , an examination , with much discursive comment , of the ideas set forth in the little book called ' A Publisher 's Confession , ' issued anonymously a few months ago .

		That book , it wiU be re - membered , was a series of heart-to-heart talks with authors , in which much was said of the recent deterioration of the ancient and honor - able profession of publishing into the mere business of book-manufacture ; these statements being coupled with a protest against the ten - dency to deal with the products of author - ship upon exclusively commercial principles .

		It was a book which combined a certain ele - ment of sound thinking with perhaps an equal element of unconscious humor .

		Of the former element , we had something to say when we dis - cussed the book early last
summer	DATE	.

		Of the lat - ter , we may content ourselves with remarking that it rested chiefly upon the fact that the spirit of commercialism was implicit in the very arguments which were aimed against it .

		This fact was discovered by Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	, and exposed with something more than his usual degree of humorous exaggeration , in a re - view which designated the writer of the * Con - fession ' as a ` high-minded shark . '

		Mr.
Holt	PERSON	, also , we should say , has examined the book with the same sort of insight , but he speaks of it in suaver accents , and suppresses the satirical note in his comments .

		It is not , however , because of its reflective relation to the small volume in question that we are now about to speak of Mr.
Holt	PERSON	's article , but because anything that Mr.
Holt	PERSON	has to say about the relation of publishers - to authors and the reading public must be in the highest degree authoritative ; must have , , indeed , far more weight than anything said ini the book which he takes for his text .

		That book embodies the ideas of the ` enterprising ' houses of recent origin ; our magazine essayist repre - sents the old-time tradition of dignified Amer - ican publishing .

		When , for example , at the conclusion of his discussion , he writes as fol - lows , we are bound to realize that a very seri - ous issue is offered by present-day conditions : ' The literature of our mother tongue has been commercialized to an extent not dreamed of in any 296 THE DIAi -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, time of which I have knowledge ; and -- let him who will say post hoc propter hoc -- within our generation our literature has fallen to a lower estate than it knew for generations before . '

		Something better than the cry of ` pessimist ' must be used to meet so grave a charge as this from so respectable a source .

		Others may seek to meet the charge -LRB- or to refute the calumny -RRB- if they will ; we are not moved to join in the attempt , because we believe that Mr.
Holt	PERSON	is substantially justified in his contention .

		We think , moreover , that he has indicated with considerable precision the specific sort of com - mercialization which has brought about these deplorable consequences .

		Complete analysis of so complex a problem is hardly to be expected in a single paper of magazine dimensions , but our author can not be far from right when he singles out for chief emphasis the malign in - fluence of the ` literary agent ' and the resort of the publishing trade -LRB- for this occasion ` trade ' seems to be the right word -RRB- to reckless extrava - gance in advertising .

		Taking first the question of the literary agent , it is urged that he has so undermined the old confidential relation between publisher and author as to create suspicion where trust formerly existed , and to work mischief with both of the parties between whom he has in - terposed his services .

		The old system of mu - tual obligation has given way to a system in which authors are persuaded to make ill-ad - vised demands of their publishers , threatening to turn elsewhere if the demands are not ai-c - ceded to , and publishers no longer dare to work for the future , -- ^ that is , for the steady upbuilding of the reputations of the men whose books they publish .

		An author owes his first success to the services of his publisher , and straightway his next book , which should nat - urally go to the same house , is hawked about the market by the wily agent -- intent only upon commissions -- and sold to the highest bidder .

		The publisher , under these circum - stances , or anticipating these conditions , will naturally cease to concern himself with his au - thor 's future interests .

		As for the author , he will find in the long run that his gain has been elusive ; he may have received larger lump sums than would otherwise have been the case , but his books , scattered among perhaps half a dozen publishers , will not support each other , and the income from them will tend to become a vanishing quantity .

		Turning now to the question of advertising , we find a most emphatic condemnation of the recent wild extravagance of publishers . '

		I can not but think , ' says Mr.
Holt	PERSON	, ` that lately many American publishers were as crazy about advertising as the Dutch ever were about tulips , or the French about the
Mississippi	LOCATION	Bubble .

		* When publishers resort to the methods of de - partment stores , and fill whole pages in the daily newspapers with the brazen laudation of their wares , it is time for someone to prick the bubble of this particular folly ; and this our writer has most effectively done .

		* There is the advertising that appeals to the eye , and the advertising that appeals to the in - telligence .

		One shapes popular habit , independent - ly of deliberation ; everybody has eyes , and every - body uses food and shoes ; so this kind of ad - vertising may take root anywhere and it pays to scatter it .

		But the eighty million people using food and shoes in the
United States	LOCATION	did not in - clude a hundred thousand who would buy a single book advertised last year , and probably do not include fifty thousand who spend as much on books as they do on shoes .

		Whatever the number , they are the very people least affected by the sort of advertising that appeals to habit .

		Let them know sufficiently clearly what there is in the market that they may care for , and they will make up their minds whether they want it or not ; and the more damnable iteration you bother them with , the more apt you will be to turn them away . '

		Discrimination in advertising is of course the remedy for extravagance .

		The writer of ' A Publisher 's Confession ' speaks of houses that spend such sums as a quarter of a million an - nually .

		It ought to be fairly clear that no such sum as this can be spent by a single house with - out wasting the greater part of it .

		Such ex - penditure is merely advertising at random , without practically any attempt to select the proper medium .

		The same writer speaks slight - ingly of advertisements inserted in ' those pub - lications that go only to the literary class , ' calls them ` superfluous , ' and says that their main use is ` to keep pleasant the relations be - tween the publishers and these journals . '

		This truly amazing opinion receives scant courtesy from Mr.
Holt	PERSON	, who from the vantage-ground of forty years ' experience has learned that the sort of advertising thus contemptuously dis - missed is the only kind that really counts .

		To him , the ' very few thousand persons ' who learn about the appearance of new books from the literary journals ' are the only persons to whom books can be profitably advertised ; and a book 's fate is sealed by what is said about it by them . '

		The gist of the whole matter ap - pears to be found in our essayist 's dictum that although ` publishers ' advertisements seem to be in great part wasted as far as the large ma - jority of the public is concerned , they can ap - peal to their special public through special or - gans . '

		This strikes us as an eminently sane opinion .

		As far as Mr.
Holt	PERSON	's argument raav be
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAI .

		297 summed up in concise form , it is found in the following paragraph : ' Mv opinion , based npon a very long experi - ence , is that the remarkable concurrence of the manv exceptional conditions I have described -- the piracy under the old non-copyright license , the chaos of the transition from the old license to the new law , the advertising mania , the mad compe - tition stimulated by the literary agents , -- has produced a strange and abnormal condition in publishing , and that this condition is destructive and can not last .

		It has already wrought great ruin , and how much more ruin it must work before a healthy condition can arise , and how that ruin can be minimized , is matter for anxious consideration .

		One class of remedies is clear , if the trade has character enough to apply them , -- more subordination of the present to the future , more avoidance of petty games that two can play at , more faith in the business value of the Goldefi Rule , more feeling for the higher possibilities of their '' profession , '' and more plain , homely , com - monplace self-respect .

		The publishers probably have their human share of the needed virtues , but they have been strangely and sorely tried . '

		What is commercialism in literature ?

		It is the effort on the part of the publisher to make the cheap manufacture and the extensive sell - ing of books his foremost aim .

		It is the effort on the part of the author to write what will sell the best , and to accept the highest bid that is made for his work , irrespective of all other considerations .

		And what is profession - alism in literature ?

		It is the determination on the part of the publisher to eschew specula - tion , to adhere to the old-fashioned code of eth - ics , to think more of the dignity and responsi - bility of his occupation than of its cash returns .

		It is the decision on the part of the author to exert his powers for the general welfare rather than for the largest personal gain , to write well rather than to write much , and to recognize that in his relations with the publisher he has obligations no less than rights .

		Publishing and authorship alike ma -RCB- ' degenerate from profes - sions into trades , if sordid and short-sighted motives are allowed to prevail .

		The same con - siderations that apply to journalism apply also to book-making ; the promoter of the * yellow ' newspaper has his counterpart in what we may fairly call the ' yellow ' publisher , and the jour - nalist who utters for hire opinions that are not his own has his counterpart in the author who deliberately panders to a vulgar popular taste .

		* There are some pursuits , ' says Mr.
Holt	PERSON	, ' in which it is almost as dangerous to make money the main end , as in the general conduct of life it is to make personal happiness the main end ; and the higher the pursuit , the greater the danger . '

		It is one thing to earn a decent liv - ing by honorable means ; it is quite another to gain a fortune by the abandonment of ideals and the degradation of activities to a lowered ' level of purpose .

		SIR
HENRY IRVING	PERSON	AND HIS ART .

		In the annals of the stage , no actor ever aroused such discussion or elicited such widely divergent opinions from critical minds as Sir
Henry Irving	PERSON	.

		Mr.
William Archer	PERSON	said that English critics , * obeying an inevitable tendency of dramatic criticism , made Irving a law unto himself . '

		Yet at the announcement of a new production by him , a desire to pay a tribute of respect to her greatest histrionic artist inspired the inhabitants of
London	LOCATION	, and demonstrated itself with a force which old play-goers regard as unprecedented save in
the later days of Macready	DATE	.

		Professional critics celebrated the event by lengthened dissertations on Irving 's peculiarities , weaving a net of categories , of votive offerings , regulated by the aesthetic judg - ments held of the most purely intellectual and the most picturesque of modem English-speak - ing actors .

		While one would praise him for emancipating the stage from a cold , artificial , declamatory stjie , -- as if coldness and art were inseparable terms , -- another would strive to prove that the actor was no genius , because what he did was the result of labor , -- as though genius were not in itself an impulse to labor , and true conscientious labor were not one of the exponents of genius .

		This recalls a re - mark made by Irving at rehearsal : * So you have been desecrating our orisons with curious eyes , eh ?

		Eehearsals are like prayers of the faithful ; here we confess our manifold incom - pleteness at the altar of Art , and supplicate for strength to do better -- to finally achieve the highest .

		This is the confessional . '

		Still an - other critic would discuss the actor 's internal motives and peculiarities of temperament , as - sure us that the true function of the stage is to be a pronouncing dictionary of the language , and that the dialect spoken was a dialect of his own , an Irving patois ; while another would give his meed of applause because the actor ex - hibited actualities rather than poetic crea - tions , -- as if the principle were established , perchance , that the individual man is to be rep - resented , rather than the man ideally elevated .

		On the other hand , we can not sanction the critic who overlooks the duties of his voca - tion , -- who puts up with a fault in considera - tion of a beauty , who passes over an imperfect elocution for the sake of an evident inspiration of genius , who apologizes for a mannerism for the sake of the substratum of intellect which it partially covers .

		The preeminent position attained by Sir
Henry Irving	PERSON	, which met with hearty recogni - tion in
America	LOCATION	, has legitimated the verdict expressed by Sir
Bulwer Lvtton	PERSON	at the farewell 298 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, dinner given to
Macready	PERSON	over half a century ago : ' Every great actor has his manner , as every great writer has his style .

		But the orig - inality of an actor does not consist in his man - ner alone , but in his depth of thought . '

		Some one has said that to achieve only a respectable success in a round of parts is to accomplish much ; but to have maintained through them all a high altitude of merit , and more than once to have risen to the pinnacle of greatness , is to have established beyond question a rank with the foremost actors of the world .

		The artist who labors worthily in any de - partment of art is certain of respect , not to say reverence .

		The great actor is infinitely more necessary to reproduce the author 's idea of a play , than a good musical director is required for '' ^ the understanding of a great musical com - position ; you can set tunes and harmonies to notes , but not words and sentences to declama - tion .

		The actor is the real hypothetes of the prophet , the interpreter of his meaning , and his whole being -- his body , mind , and soul -- are required for performing that task .

		One of the gravest difficulties in writing about the stage , according to our venerable critic , Mr.
William Winter	PERSON	, is the need that the occupa - tion seems to impose of universality of sapience and finality of judgment . '

		No man can so en - tirely comprehend the works of Shakspeare , -- in all their height and depth of meaning , and all their variety and subtlety of suggestion , -- and at the same time so thoroughly probe the natures of the actors who pass before him , as to be able to settle all questions as to compati - bility between the two . '

		As was said of
Edwin Booth	PERSON	, it may be said that some of Irving 's Shakespearian ideals may not have matched exactly with Shake - speare 's conceptions .

		But intellectuality , ar - tistic propriety , and unfaltering intensity of purpose cast over each interpretation a charm which grew into a tie of esteem , binding the public to the artist , -- a tie which gradually strengthened during a long series of years and was strongly expressed by the demeanor of an Irving audience . '

		Deep the oak must sink in stubborn earth Its roots obscure , That hopes to lift its branches to the sky . '

		Irving was first of all an intellectual actor .

		He worked from a conception , at a time when others worked according to tradition .

		He practiced that art of dissecting and diagnosis which ' opens new veins and strikes new arteries in the most intricate shield of classicism . '

		His tendency was to the natural rather than to the ideal , to the concrete rather than the abstract .

		Exception to this general statement may be found in his repertory , but it is near enough to the truth when only generalities are possible .

		The more definite features a part presented , , the more complete was his impersonation .

		He often stated that
Kean	PERSON	blended the Realistic with the Ideal in acting , and founded a school of which
William Charles Macready	ORGANIZATION	was the foremost disciple in
England	LOCATION	.

		He believed that in acting .

		Nature must dominate Art , but at the same time Art must interpret Nature , and to interpret the thoughts and emotions of her mistress should be her first object .

		Those thoughts , those emotions , must be ' interpreted with grace , with dignity , and with temperance ; and these , let us remember .

		Art alone can teach . '

		Those actors who have greatly excelled in finished declamation have often failed to please the critical mind , which cares more for evi - dence of inspiration than for training .

		A peculiarity of utterance and of gesture , which can not be conveyed otherwise than by imita - tion , was a most important element in
Irving	LOCATION	's performance .

		But by the cultivation of this elaborate style of speech and gesture he at - tained an expression of certain emotions that no other artist ever approached .

		Every word of an entire play seemed to have been studied with the view of thoroughly ascertaining its - capability ; and the spectator was surprised at finding a striking significance elicited from an apparently unimportant line .

		The strongest exhibitions of passion would sometimes seem - ingly throw him into a rant , and the organs of speech would seem to crack under the violence of his enunciation ; but the manner in which he would turn this peculiarity , half-mental and half-physical , to account in the ironical touches - by which he relieved the graver passages of tragedy , proved a striking example of how hatred or jealousy , blended with contempt , may be told by ejaculation .

		Of calm , deliber - ate , caustic irony , he was a most consummate master .

		Irving was thoroughly absorbed in his work .

		Be it Hamlet or
Mathias	LOCATION	, Lesurques or Dubosc ,
Charles I.	PERSON	or
Louis XI.	PERSON	, we find in him that intellectual concentration , that innate human sympathy , that careful adjustment of delicate shading , that exquisite finish , which betokens at once a sincerity of purpose , a reproductive and creative faculty , characteristic of the ar - tistic temperament .

		It was
M. Coquelin	PERSON	who said in the
Irving	LOCATION	- Coquelin controversy some years ago , that the actor 's feelings must never be real , that the actor 's inner consciousness and intellectual purpose must watch over and direct and control the actor 's exterior machin - ery .

		The remark was looked upon by Irving as ` a. stultifying delusion that the votary of

		THE DIAI .

		299 acting is bound to worship everything dramatic that comes out of
France	LOCATION	. '

		In personating a character , Irving identified himself so entirely with his part that his face flushed or paled with the varying excitement of his character ; the mobility of his features proved to us that a personality of infinite susceptibility was before us .

		Whether portraying the complex emotions of life or the convergent subsidence of death , he was , in look , voice , and attitude the vibrant impersonation of his theme .

		His acting was done under a peculiarly high intensity , so much so that his performance of Hamlet was unaccompanied by the vulgar pat - ronizing forms of applause ; the possibility of losing a significant look or gesture was so great that the tragedy was respectfully heard throughout .

		This intensity was even more noticeable in his impersonation of Mathias in ' The Bells , ' where the two predominant ideas portrayed are remorse and fear .

		Perfect as was his command over each separate element of expression , it was still the harmonious con - currence with which all were brought to bear at once in the rendering of every thought and feeling of the part that constituted the distin - guishing quality of his acting ; a remark so true that one need but to have heard him read a single scene in a drawing-room , with none of the scenic aids to dramatic effect about him , yet supplying them all by this concurrent mo - bility of feature , voice , and gesture , to be con - vinced that therein lay the chief secret of his power .

		Perhaps the most fascinating characteriza - tion in
Irving	LOCATION	's repertory was his
Louis XI.	PERSON	, -- an analytical and many-colored portrayal of old age and craven ambitions .

		Instead of subor - dinating Xature to Art , he pressed all the re - sources of Art into the service of Xature , mod - elled every motive of his acting upon the reali - ties of life , so that in his most impetuous , most terrible , most pathetic portrayal of the old fanatic of Yalois , he never overstepped the truth .

		Again , in his embodiment of Robes - pierre we had an example of the actor 's faculty for getting into his character .

		It was a sym - metrical presentation .

		Declamation was ' no part of it .

		The lines of the character were spoken so simply and naturally that there was never a moment during the play when the il - lusion disappeared .

		The whole was an authen - tic and convincing picture of one of the most appalling and destructive political-social con - vulsions in human history .

		The biographer of
Edwin Booth	ORGANIZATION	pointed out that it is not the number of parts an actor plays that constitutes his strength or reveals his re - sources ; it is the height , fineness , and diver - sity of mind and spirit , the depth of feeling .

		the control of action , the knowledge of human nature , the faculty of simulation , and the trained ability , combined in his treatment of any one part , which , taken together , make up his sum .

		Rather than use the word versatility in connection with
Irving	PERSON	, let us say he was comprehensive , -- for so many characterizations created within the range of his art are equal one to the other .

		He possessed a mind suffi - ciently cx -RRB- mprehensive to portray with scholar - ship and taste what may be considered his greatest characters : Shylock , Hamlet ,
Mephis	PERSON	- topheles ,
Don Quixote	PERSON	,
King Lear	PERSON	,
Becket	LOCATION	,
Wolsey	LOCATION	,
Robespierre	LOCATION	,
Richard III.	PERSON	,
Louis XI.	LOCATION	, .

		and
Mathias	PERSON	in ' The Bells , ' -- a poetic , pictures - que , and brilliant group .

		The philosophic way in which Sir
Henry Irving	PERSON	spoke of the proper dignity of the drama has in it a conservative and vital tone which is an honor to its author .

		* In the consideration of the art of acting , it must never be forgotten that its ultimate aim is * beauty .

		Truth itself is only an element of beauty '' and to merely reproduce things vile and squalid is a debasement of Art .

		Life , with all its pains and sorrows ' , is a beautiful and a precious gift ; and the actor 's art is to reproduce this beautiful thing , giving due emphasis to those royal virtues and those stormy passions which sway the destinies of men .

		Thus the lesson given by long experi - ence -- by the certain punishment of ill-doing -- and by the rewards that follow on bravery , fore - bearance , and self-sacrifice , are on the mimic stage conveyed to men .

		And thus every actor who is more than a mere machine , and who has an ideal of any kind , has a duty which lies beyond the scope of his personal ambition .

		His art must be something to hold in reverence if he wishes other * to hold it in esteem .

		There is nothing of chance about his work .

		All , actors and audience alike , must bear in mind that the whole scheme of the Drama is not to be regarded as a game in life which can be played with varying success .

		Its present intention may be to interest and amuse , but its deeper purpose is earnest , intense , sincere , * Ingram :
A. Pyle	PERSON	.

		The little volume of ` Love Poems of
John Donne	PERSON	, ' recently issued in a limited edition by the
Riverside Press	ORGANIZATION	, is of unusual interest on several accounts .

		In the first place , its outward appear - ance is such that no lover of fine bookmaking could fail to rejoice in its possession .

		Then it gives us in convenient form perhaps the best work of a poet not easily accessible to the casual pres - ent-day reader .

		The French People in Their Homes .

		* If the average intelligent American were questioned , never so leniently , as to his ideas of home life in
France	LOCATION	, it is pretty certain that his answers would be the confession of an ig - norance at once profound and elemental .

		If he had been put through a course in the history of the French Eevolution , he might dimly re - call some of the citations from
Arthur Young	PERSON	's Travels to be found in the foot-notes of his Mignet ,
Guizot	LOCATION	,
Thiers	PERSON	, or
Carlyle	LOCATION	; or if he had been so well-advised as to read Mr.
Brown	PERSON	- ell 's brilliant essay on ' French Traits , ' he might claim to have been at least introduced to some of the controlling tendencies in the na - tional character .

		But until he had read care - fully such a book as this of Miss Betham-Ed - wards , his ideas on the social life of that great and minutely ordered community would prob - ably be either non-existent or mostly wrong .

		It is not to the point that the Frenchman in

		With this the reader will probably compare the following paragraphs , which occur a little further on -LRB- p. 261 -RRB- : * Why , in a pre-eminent - ly intellectual and fastidious people , do we find an undisguised , immoderate addiction to le gros rire , an insatiable appetite for the gro - tesquely laughable ?

		... Every French - man has a touch of Rabelais , of
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	, in his composition ... Laughter -- the co - pious exercise of the risible faculties -- is a constitutional , a physical need of the Gallic temperament . '

		In explanation .

		Miss
Betham	PERSON	-
Edwards	ORGANIZATION	reminds us that ` no wave of
Puri	PERSON	- tanism has at any time swept over the land of Eabelais ' ; and she doubtless would ask us to discriminate between cheerfulness and frivol - ity , -- though she herself can only close her in - quiry with another question : ' How came it that `` L' Allegro '' was written by an
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	and a Puritan , and not by a Frenchman ?

		The matter must remain an eternal mystery . '

		How thoroughly the importance of the fam - ily as the social unit is recognized by the au - thor may be gathered from the fact that seven of the thirtv-five chapters have the following titles : ` The Baby , ' ` The Girl , ' ` The Boy , ' ` Brides and Bridegrooms , ' ` Wives and Mothers , ' ` The Family Council , ' ` The Code Civil and Family Life ' ; while the allied topics of '
House	ORGANIZATION	- keeping ' and ' Domestic Service ' are given a luminous exposition which contains for the much-tried American housekeeper information , suggestion -- and here and there a bit of con - solation .

		Miss Betham-Edwards is no lover of militar - ism , and has only condemnation for the uni - versal conscription , whose crushing burdens she so vividly depicts .

		But she has great hopes from the new laws reducing the term of service from three years to two , as promising financial economy and the rectification of grave abuses .

		As for the French officer of to-day , she defends him from ' insular misconception ' in the fol - lowing words : ' Is he not pictured as a light - hearted , inconsequent , dashing fellow , a some - thing of the
D'Artagnan	LOCATION	, a something of the
Charles O'Malley	PERSON	about him , professional duties sitting lightly upon his shoulders , domestic cares quite shaken off ?

		True to life were a directly opposite portrait , -- that of an inde - fatigable worker , one to whom fireside joys and intellectual pleasures are especially dear , and to whom self-abnegation in the loftiest as well as the domestic sense becomes a second nature . '

		The author has been especially interested in educational questions ; and she has carefully

		THE DIAL 301 studied the system of French schools as re - formed under the beneficent Ferry laws of 1881-2 , whose praises she is always sounding .

		How thoroughly she has gone into this matter may be estimated from the fact that she has been made an ' officier de I ` instruction publique / as well as from the fulness and sympathy with which she describes the village schoolmaster and the lycees for boys and girls .

		Two pleasant chapters are those on ' My Friend the Cure ' and ' The Protestant Pastor , ' in which two very amiable characters fairly contest with each other for the reader 's favor , and are probably brought into closer proximity on the printed page than they are in real life , to judge from the following paragraph : * Here I will mention that , although the Catholic and Protestant population live harmoniously side by side , intermarriages are rare , and the rival churches neither gain nor lose adherents to any appreciable extent .

		Between Protestant pas - tor and Catholic priest in any part of

		They stand aloof from each other as French and Ger - mans in the annexed provinces . '

		On these and other topics .

		Miss Betham-Ed - wards discourses with intelligent vivacity and good humor , lightening our darkness , gently removing the prejudice bom of ignorance , and steadily building up the respect that rests on knowledge .

		Her style is easy and colloquial , occasionally careless : e. g. , Hhe utterance of

		The plastic nature of clay and its susceptibility to the action of fire , comprise the two elements which form the basis of the development of the potter 's art .

		The modelling of clay into the forms of the physical world gave birth to the plastic art , under which term sculpture is still known .

		It was by the invention of the potter 's wheel , ascribed in turn to all the great nations of antiquity , and indicated in its complete development on Egyptian monuments , that the art of the potter advanced beyond mere utilitarianism , and from an industrial to a fine art , and began its mission among the things which beautify life .

		As in architecture and sculpture , so in pot - tery ,
Greece	LOCATION	excelled all the other nations of antiquity .

		Vases were of far greater impor - tance to the life of the Greeks than we can readily appreciate in these days .

		To them , a vase might serve as a receptacle for food and drink , for storage , or for the adornment of the home .

		It was used in the daily life of the living , and was buried with the dead .

		Vase - making and vase-painting were among the most conspicuous industries of
Athens	LOCATION	, where the potters were called Prometheans -LRB- from Titus Prometheus , who made man out of clay -RRB- .

		The manufacture of pottery , though lucrative , was not held in high esteem among the
Athen	LOCATION	- ians .

		Nevertheless , the names of some of the potters have come down to the present day .

		When the science of archaeology arose , the vases of
Greece	LOCATION	, especially those that were dec - orated with painted scenes , were found of great value as furnishing monuments from which to 802 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, study the life , the art , and the mythology of the Greeks ; and with the advance made by the scientific explorers in
Athens	LOCATION	and the mate - rials gathered up elsewhere , the study of Greek pottery has become ' one of the most ad - vanced and firmly based branches of classical archaeology / In the seventeenth century the fashion arose in
Western Europe	LOCATION	and
Great Britain	LOCATION	of mak - ing journeys to
Italy	LOCATION	and
Greece	LOCATION	and bring - ing back whatever spoils of travel might at - tract the attention .

		It was then that the pot - tery of classical times began to receive notice and collections began to be made .

		Interest therein was stimulated by the publications of
Winckelmann	PERSON	about a century later ; about which time also Sir
William Hamilton	PERSON	, some - time English Ambassador to
Naples	LOCATION	, formed there a collection of Greek and Eoman an - tiquities discovered in the tombs of
Southern Italy	LOCATION	and Etruria , brought it with him to
England	LOCATION	, and sold it in
1767	DATE	to the then newly instituted British Museum , where it formed the nucleus of the present magnificent collection in that Museum .

		Other collections were made , and with the fashion for collect - ing grew up a literature of the subject , con - sisting for the most part of catalogues , with more or less imperfect descriptions and illus - trations .

		The first adequate treatment the history of ancient pottery received was in the two vol - umes of Dr.
Samuel Birch	PERSON	, published in
1857	DATE	.

		This work grew out of a ' Catalogue of Greek and Etruscan Vases in the Britism Museum , ' upon which Dr.
Birch	PERSON	had collaborated with another in
1851	DATE	.

		Birch was a versatile genius , -- an Egyptologist , Keeper of the
Department of Oriental Antiquities	ORGANIZATION	in the British Museum , and an expert in the field of Ceramics with a special genius for the detection of counter - feits .

		His ` History of Ancient Pottery ' was regarded as a standard work , especially after the revision to which it was subjected in
1873	DATE	, when it appeared in a new edition , abridged in some respects , enlarged in others , and em - bodying the fullest knowledge of the subject at that time .

		Since
Birch	PERSON	's death , in
1885	DATE	, so much new material has been gathered that a further revision of his work has been de - manded , and this has been successfully under - taken by Mr.
Henry B. Walters	PERSON	, the Assistant Keeper of Greek and Eoman Antiquities in the same Museum , who was prepared for the task by the publication of his ' Catalogue of Greek and Etruscan Vases , ' and monographs on * Black Figured Vases ' -LRB- 1893 -RRB- and * Vases of the Latest Period ' -LRB-
1896	DATE	-RRB- .

		The results of this revision and extension of Dr.
Birch	PERSON	's work are two sumptuous vol - umes of considerably more than five hundred pages each , well provided with indexes and bibliographies , with illustrative plates -LRB- several of them in color -RRB- , and between two and three hundred text illustrations .

		With the excep - tion of the first five chapters of the first vol - ume -LRB- on Greek Pottery in general -RRB- , which remain substantially as they appeared in Dr.
Birch	PERSON	's edition of
1873	DATE	, the work has been entirely rewritten , with especial attention to the vast gains to the knowledge of the sub - ject through the completion of the excavations of the Acropolis at
Athens	LOCATION	in
1889	DATE	, and to the advance made since that date in the study of pottery , especially that of the primitive peri - ods .

		Such parts of the original work as dealt with
Oriental Pottery	ORGANIZATION	have been omitted , and the pottery of the Celts and of
Northern Europe	LOCATION	is `` ignored .

		The subject being thus narrowed to the Greek , Etruscan , and Eoman pottery , the opportunity is offered for a fuller treatment of the history of Greek Vase Paint - ing and for an epexegetic examination of the subjects depicted upon Greek vases , and to ac - cord to Etruscan and Eoman pottery almost the same scientific treatment as that given to Greek vases .

		Dr.
Birch	PERSON	was himself so modest that he was content to allow much of his best work to appear only in the volumes of others .

		It seems to be in graceful recognition of this that Mr.
Walters	PERSON	describes his books on their title-pages as * Based upon the work of Sam - uel
Birch	LOCATION	, ' -- ^ as though he were unwilling , as we all should be , to have Dr.
Birch	PERSON	's monu - mental work supplanted by newer volumes .

		` The Jewish Spectre . '

		* x ^ ccepted as a semi-historical account of all that the Jewish race has done and left un - done since the beginnings of record , Mr.
George H. Warner	PERSON	's ` Jewish Spectre ' is a work of interest and value .

		Mr.
Warner	PERSON	is essentially a collector of information .

		His work shows a truly extraordinary familiarity with all that has been said or written on ev - ery side of the question with which he deals .

		He is equally master of Bible records , Tal - mudic lore , higher criticism , archaeological in - vestigation , modern journalism , philosophy , sociolog
-RCB- %	PERCENT	science .

		He has , besides , the grace of humor , often denied to those who spend their lives among serious books .

		The one thing he lacks is a proper sense of propor - tion , -- the sense that gives to great books a central idea , a beginning and an end .

The Jewish Spectre	ORGANIZATION	.

George H. Warner	PERSON	.

Doubleday , Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.


1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAI .

		303
Warner	ORGANIZATION	plays with his subject , writes all around it , runs all along it , keeps its great possibilities ever before his readers , but never • quite succeeds in compassing it or making it all his own .

		The interest , even to enthu - siasm , which increases steadily during the reading of the first half of the book vanishes ^ adually as the conviction grows that Mr.
Warner	PERSON	will not arrive .

		It is all very well to say that the * Human Being 's the Thing , ' hut even capital letters do not make a philos - ophy of life or history of that postulate .

		It is very interesting , very true , and very use - ful , to know that Bible records are partly fic - tion , partly tradition , partly the history of a race from that race 's point of view .

		It is easily admitted that the Jews have lived too much in a past whose glory is as largely a mat - ter of the chronicler 's vision as of history ; that from earliest Old Testament times their laws liave been made for themselves , as the
Chosen People	ORGANIZATION	, ignoring , so far as possible , the rest of the world ; that with the
Chosen People	ORGANIZATION	idea as a basis , they have been clannish , vain , proud , intolerant , loyal , conservative , idealistic .

		But after all this , it may be asked , what then ? -RSB-

		V -LSB- r.
Warner	ORGANIZATION	's book is distinctly not a tirade against the Jews .

		It will be offensive to Jew - ish preachers and teachers , but not more so than to their Christian brethren against whom Mr.
Warner	PERSON	inveighs with equal zest .

		* The Jewish Spectre ' is based on an opposition to theocracy .

		Most of the Old Testament , he asserts , was written or i ^ vised by priests in the interest of priestly government .

		And there is much in the accredited results of higher • criticism to affirm this judgment .

		The relig - ions which to-day unite under the name of Christian seem to ^ ir .

		Warner not religious and distinctly not Christian , but ecclesiastical .

		So far as the religion which Christ preached vas essentially unchurched , imdogmatic , a matter of the soul and not of ceremony , he is Tight .

		Mr.
Warner	PERSON	blames the Old
Testa	PERSON	- ment chroniclers , with their theocratic tenden - cies , for the hold which the ` Jewish Spectre ' lias had on the mind of all peoples in all ages .

		Be blames
Paul	PERSON	, the Jew , for propagating the racial tendency to submit to religion as authority .

		To him , organized religion is the ■ foundation of all opposition to progress .

		This is evidently the idea which he intends should he central in his book , although he never quite follows it to a conclusion .

		The only place where a solution is suggested is in the chapter on ` Tenure of Eeligions , ' where Mr.
Warner	PERSON	writes , in part : * It is not too much to hope , perhaps not too much to expect , that with the progress the world is now making , religious dominations will cease , that organized religion as an efifort of the human mind will disappear .

		The immense relief this would be to humanity can only be estimated by reviewing the history of the past , in which in all countries and in every age religions have been the principal burdens on the back of • humanity .

		When ccclesiasticism passes away as a political power and as a superstition , it will leave the Hu - man Being free to organize his social institutes according to his ever-increasing knowledge and intelligence , and to reorganize them whenever it becomes necessary -- a most essential part of free - dom .

		` The `` religion of authority , '' so fascinating to manv minds of the present day , has one weak link * in its chain of title .

		It is the impossibility of identifying , beyond reasonable question , the earthly authority with a heavenly source .

		The evi - dences of miracles , of the printed word , even of an irrefragable apostolic succession , are not con - vincing that a surrender ought to be made to such `` authority '' .

		At the bottom of such surrender there is a certain loyalty to ideas , but a congenital disability of the imagination .

		For who shall tell us that when perishing by Protestantism , the only refuge is Catholicism , as though there were but two religious ideas ... Perhaps Arbitration points the way out , -- to have nothing but free courts , or free courts and newspapers .

		Perhaps Socialism is the method -- socialism without the newspaper , for then nothing would happen .

		So - cialism shocks the sense of the politician and the comfortable ; but we must remember that the so - cialistic process has built a schoolhouse on every hill , and thrown in the text-books ; it carries our letters almost free , makes highways , builds bridges , lights the streets , brings water , creates pleasure parks with music on
Saturdays	DATE	, preserves forests , distributes garden seeds , reguliites the weather , lights the shores of oceans , protects us from wild beasts and contagion , -- and is almost the Gospel itself .

		` Those of us who have read the Old Testament remem.ber how
Samuel	PERSON	resisted any changes in the administration .

		A pure theocracy was his highest ideal , and when called upon to anoint a king , he thought all was over , his vocation gone .

		Yet see what happened .

		After
Saul	PERSON	there were more prophets than anything else in
Israel	LOCATION	, -- and but for them
Israel	LOCATION	never would have been heard of .

		So it may turn out with our holy men .

		The the - ologian will find that Law ,
Government	ORGANIZATION	, and Eco - nomics are sciences , and not in the same realm with theology , and that a return to religion , - -- which dwells in the mind of man , giving it its seriousness and its deepest charm , -- is his best hold . '

		The reference to
Israel	LOCATION	's prophets and their relation to
Israel	LOCATION	's historic greatness -LRB- so un - warranted , according to Mr.
Warner	PERSON	-RRB- illus - trates one of the chief weaknesses of the book .

		If it were intended as a polemic , the author would be justified in stating only his side of the case .

		But it is written with every inten - tion of fairness , to place the Jew in his proper historic and social relation to the rest of the world .

		Why , then , does Mr.
Warner	PERSON	give credence to the prophets alone among
Israel	LOCATION	's teachers and scribes ?

		Their superior eloquence is not a proof of their better judg - ment .

		If chroniclers of Old Testament times were inclined to slav a hundred thousand men 304 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, in battles in which mere material conditions of space precluded the presence of more than a tenth of that number , so Old Testament prophets , zealous for social , political , and moral reform , may be trusted to have exag - gerated the evil conditions of their times .

		In fact , while chroniclers have changed with the progress of humanity , and history is fast be - coming an exact science , prophets and preach - ers have remained the same in all ages , and probably will remain so to the end of time .

		Mr.
Warner	PERSON	need only go to church or to syna - gogue to-day to discover how irretrievably wicked this world is in the eyes of these men .

		Yet somehow or other , when the sun shines it hardly seems so bad .

		Mr.
Warner	PERSON	negatives too much and con - structs too little .

		He deprives the Jews of their heritage of religious and historic suprem - acy , of their superior morality , longevity , in - tellect , persistency , -- all the attributes that have adorned the Spectre through the ages .

		But he gives the world nothing to build on in place of the accepted foundation , -- nothing but the Human Being .

		And he forgets that the Human Being is not an unchangeable en - tity , but an active growing force , changing with the ages and only now arriving at the stage of development where he may be trusted to stand alone without the support of author - ity , religious , social , or governmental .

		Mr.
Warner	PERSON	has read so much that it seems sur - prising that he has omitted
Walter Bagehot	PERSON	's ' Physics and Politics , ' or that , having read it , the lessons of the moulds which man makes for himself and breaks as he outgrows should have escaped him .

		The conclusions suggested , if not reached , in ' The Jewish Spectre ' are to a large extent a matter of personal judg - ment .

		There is hardly a page in the volume which does not suggest a point for controversy , and it is likely .

		that no two readers will be impressed by the same features in just the same way .

		STurnES IN Administrative IjAw .

		* Constitutional law has been thoroughly stud - ied in most countries , at least in most coun - tries that have constitutions .

		In the
United States	LOCATION	it has been a favorite theme of debate since the formation of the Constitution ; nor does the interest in it show any sign of abate - ment .

		This is altogether natural , since our government is preeminently one of funda - mental laws back of and controlling our legis - lative and administrative activity .

		On the • The Peinciples of the Administrative Law of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		By
Frank J. Goodnow	PERSON	, LL.D .

		New York :
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		other hand , the administrative side of our system has received comparatively little at - tention .

		The task of making a scientific analy - sis of it was left to a foreigner , Mr.
James Bryce	PERSON	, in his ' American Commonwealth . '

		Dr.
Fairlie	PERSON	, in his '
National Administration	ORGANIZATION	, ' has given us an account of the manner in which the various departments of the central gov - ernment perform their allotted tasks ; but in all this the real law of administration has received only incidental notice .

		In his ' Com - parative Administrative Law , ' published twelve years ago .

		Professor
Goodnow	PERSON	gave an analysis of the administrative system , national and lo - cal , of the
United States	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and
Germany	LOCATION	.

		The rapid growth of public interest in our own system was thought by Professor
Goodnow	PERSON	a sufficient justification for a new book giving a fuller account of American conditions , with special emphasis upon the legal side ; and this is now published with the title ` The Principles of the Administra - tive Law of the
United States	LOCATION	. '

		Administrative law is defined by Professor
Goodnow	PERSON	as ` that part of the law which fixes the organization and determines the compe - tence of the authorities that execute the law , and indicates to the individual remedies for the violation of his rights . '

		It is partly con - stitutional , partly statutory , and partly ordi - nance and even common law .

		In the first part , or book , the author discusses the theory of the separation of powers , and shows that not only was there `` o government in existence at the time
Montesquieu	LOCATION	wrote in which the theory was carried out , but that no political organization has ever been established in which there is no overlapping in the discharge of the three functions .

		The legislature frequently assumes or takes part in functions which really belong to the executive , as in ` special legisla - tion ' -LRB- which , however , some commonwealths forbid -RRB- and the appointment and removal of officers .

		The reason for this is to secure polit - ical control .

		The executive , on the other hand , participates in the legislative power , not only in signing or vetoing bills , but also in issuing ordinances to supply deficiencies in legislation .

		This , too , is in spite of the fact that an effort was made to incorporate the theory of the separation of power into the American public law .

		For example , the first constitution of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	expressly forbade one department to exercise the functions of another .

		The
Federal Constitution	ORGANIZATION	also prac - tically does the same thing in naming each power and providing how it shall be exercised .

		But the three powers are left undefined .

		If resort be had to judicial decisions , they will often be found confiicting .

		To find the line
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 305 of demarcation in any commonwealth , then , the student must examine the decisions of its courts .

		However , two general principles may be deduced : -LRB- 1 -RRB- That an act satisfies the requirement of separation when completely in - dependent of the control of the other depart - ments ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- That the principle does not apply to local governments .

		The principle of separation can not , in the nature of things , be carried to the point of absolute independence .

		The legislature regu - lates the administration by law , but , the ex - ecutive being independent of the legislature in tenure , it has no control over the actual ad - ministration except by impeachment .

		The control of the courts is somewhat greater , since they may declare orders , decisions , contracts , and ordinances null and void .

		Over political acts , however , such as making treaties , dispo - sition of the military forces , etc. , they have no control .

		In discussing the
Central Administration	ORGANIZATION	, Professor
Goodnow	PERSON	brin ^ out some differences between the powers of the President and those of a
State Governor	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Constitutional Con - vention of
1787	DATE	debated for some time whether to provide a plural or a single executive , but finally agreed upon the latter and made it real .

		The growth of the ordinance power is one of the most noteworthy things in connection with the office of President .

		The Colonial
Gover	PERSON	- nors did not have it , neither was it granted to the President by the Constitution .

		He may issue orders to his subordinates in the routine of administration which can be enforced only by the power of removal .

		The courts will not enforce them , neither will they abrogate them .

		On the other hand , many ordinances have been issued for the regulation of the army and nsLXj , the postal service , the internal rev - enue , etc. , and these the courts recognize as having the force of law .

		But the most im - portant source of the President 's power in con - trolling administration rests in his right of appointment and removal .

		The absolute right of removal was recognized by the first Con - gress by the casting vote of the Vice-Presi - dent , and has been conceded ever since with the exception of twenty years -LRB- 1867-1887 -RRB- , and during this time the restraint was only nom - inal .

		The attempt to restrict arose out of the imusually strained relations between the Ex - ecutive and
Congress	ORGANIZATION	in
1867	DATE	.

		This power is all important , since by it the President may control administration in matters left by Con - gress to the discretion of a department officer .

		A notable use of the power was the removal of a Secretary of the
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	by President
Jackson	PERSON	for refusing to execute a law accord - ing to the President 's interpretation of it .

		A
State Governor	ORGANIZATION	, on the other hand , is more of a political than administrative of - ficer .

		The executive power is in reality par - celled out among the various State officers whose tenure of office is independent of the Governor .

		Not only has he no power to direct these officers how to carry on the work of ad - ministration , but they may even issue orders in opposition to his will .

		His power of ap - pointment and removal in the lower offices is generally very Kmited .

		Professor
Goodnow	PERSON	says that a Governor , like the President , is not subject to the process of courts while in office .

		The writer knows of one case where a Gov - ernor was fined for breach of the peace , but can not say whether or not the fine was ever collected .

		The limits of this review will not permit of an extended notice of the entire volume .

		It must suffice to say that the treatment of the subjects of the other parts is no less thorough than in the ones we have discussed .

		The vol - imie is a notable contribution to the literature of public law , and will prove of great use , not only to students , but also to officials in the actual work of administration .

		But to the writer there appears to be a few omissions of importance , some of which would probably indicate a defect in our constitutional law .

		The author points out that , while there are remedies against most of the positive acts of the administration , there is practically none against a refusal to act when an attempt to compel action by the court would bring it into conflict with the President .

		This might have been emphasized by the citation of cases in which the President ignored the decisions of
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	and acted upon his own interpretation of the law .

		Such was the act of Jefferson in withholding a commission de - clared by the court -LRB-
Marbury vs. Madison	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- to be due the plaintiff , and by
Jackson	PERSON	in refus - ing to execute the decree of the court in the
Cherokee Nation	ORGANIZATION	vs.
Georgia	LOCATION	case .

		The case of ex parte
Merryman	PERSON	, wherein the writ of habeas corpus was disregarded by order of the President , is referred to , but not for this specific purpose .

		Governors are not so far exempt as the President , yet no provision has ever been devised to compel them to obey a very clear mandate of the Constitution -- that requiring the rendition of fugitives from jus - tice upon the demand of the Executive of the
State	ORGANIZATION	from which they fled .

		They are left no discretion in the matter , yet refusals have been made for reasons insulting to the
State	ORGANIZATION	making the demand .

		The author holds that military administra - tion is a thing apart , deserving of separate treatment .

		This is undoubtedly true of things 306 THE DIALi -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, strictly military ; yet a kind of civil adminis - tration is often administered through the mil - itary , and this might reasonably have been given at least a brief analysis .

		It is supposed to be based on some laws other than those of necessity , though sometimes it is difficult to discover any except the whim of the ad - ministrator .

		For example , it is hard to un - derstand how , since the decision of the Insular Oases , the Secretary of the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	imposes a tariff in
Tutuila	LOCATION	different from -LRB- and lower than -RRB- our own , if it is American territory ; and if it is not American territory , why the Secre - tary of the
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	admits goods from Tutu - ila into the
United States	LOCATION	free of duty .

England	LOCATION	and Ho llan d. * So thorough and honest an historical work as the
Dexters	ORGANIZATION	' '
England	LOCATION	and
Holland	PERSON	of the Pilgrims ' can afford to have its merits and limitations known at once .

		Like the story of the Pilgrims itself , the book needs neither em - bellishment nor factitious advertisement .

		It may not be a ' seller , ' but it will not die .

		This particular kind of work , after that of the three Dexters , will not require to be done again for a century or more .

		In a word , we have not here a flight of the imagination , but the re - sults of solid , long-continued , painstaking re - search , with correction and re-correction of the first work and of various mistaken impressions , confusions , and inferences of other writers .

		In one sense , the book is a disappointment .

		It is not a broadly sketched or framed , or even a brightly colored , picture of the
England	LOCATION	and
Holland	PERSON	of the century of the Pilgrims .

		It is not even a sober-tinted sketch or a justifiable composition-piece representing in vivid text the two lands of home and exile trodden by Pilgrim feet .

		It is rather a selection of ele - ments which , by documentary proof only , are known to have affected the Separatists ' lives and their church movement .

		It is a book made by bookmen .

		Sometimes , as we read , our vision is obstructed ; we can not see the forest on account of the trees .

		The grand human story seems lost in a mass of antiquarian de - tail .

		One longs to know more of manhood and womanhood , and less of theological , biblio - graphical , and ecclesiastical lore and discussion .

		Few books have had such a history and such rich harvests reaped during three generations of scholarly and untiring quest .

		One chapter pictures the economic , political , and intellectual ele - ments of the time when churches that were re - publics started in

		tions as they exist to-day .

		The immediate suggestion of these remarks is offered by two of the latest novels , both concerned with strikes and their attendant brutalities , and both writ - ten with a grip upon their subject which compels our attention .

		The fact that both are written by women is a matter of incidental interest only ; the only surprising thing about it is that women should be so successful in mastering the essentially masculine vocabulary necessary for the portrayal of these rough sit - uations .

		Of these two books , ` The Grapple , ' by Mrs.
Grace MacGowan Cooke	PERSON	, is the sim - pler in construction and the more tense in dic - tion .

		The story is told about a coal mine in central
Illinois	LOCATION	, and has for its hero the owner and manager , a man of calm courage and abundant resource , who wins his fight in the face of great obstacles , but vindicates the right of the capitalist to retain in his own hands the control of his own business .

		All the leading incidents in this story might easily be paralleled in the actual recent history of the
Illinois	LOCATION	mines .

		The seriousness of the book is relieved by an element of humor , which is perhaps better than nothing , although it is humor of a rather cheap sort , for which the writer acknowledges indebtedness to a Mr.
Eeed	PERSON	, giving him the title of ' a playing part - ner ' in her work .

		` The Man of the Hour ' is the first full - grown novel that Miss Alice French has writ - ten .

		The scene is
Fairport	LOCATION	, which may be translated without much difficulty into
Daven	PERSON	- port , the city of the author 's residence .

		Now one of the characteristics of this
Iowa	LOCATION	com - munity is a curious blending of foreign strains with its native population , and it is just this mixture of racial elements that gives piquancy to the present story , at the cost , naturally , of its integrity of tyjpe as a novel of American character .

		An iron manufacturer of large interests , a self-made man and a rugged American , brings home with him from
Europe	LOCATION	a Russian wife , who is an aristocrat of social sympathies , indoctrinated by
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	, aUied with the revolutionary movement , and an impracticable visionary .

		It is a sad ease of mismating ; for there is no possibility of gen - uine sympathy between those two contrasted temperaments .

		From this union springs the boy who is the hero of the story .

		The mother is set upon winning him to her ways of think - ing , and the father is helpless to counteract her emotional and sentimental influence .

		When in due course the wife , finding her life intol - erable , leaves her husband and returns to the congenial society of the Russian exile colony in
Switzerland	LOCATION	, the boy has been moulded into a passionate little socialist , and the father 808 THE
DIAX	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, despairs .

		Presently the father remarries , dies a few years later , and leaves his fortune to his widow , to be held in trust for the boy until he shall prove himself capable of using it wise - ly .

		A certain sum , however , is given him ab - solutely ; and of this he proceeds to make ducks and drakes by going to
Chicago	LOCATION	, and casting in his fortunes with a labor organization .

		The time is now that of the Pullman strike of
1894	DATE	; and the money goes to the bolstering of that indefensible cause .

		The boy is now left * on his uppers / and becomes a mechanic ; but his eyes are slowly opening , and the seamy side of the labor agitation is gradually dis - closed to him .

		After a while he drifts back to
Fairport	LOCATION	, secures employment in the very establishment reared by his father 's efforts , and presently finds himself in a position of responsibility , and engaged in defending the business against the assaults of his old-time associates .

		He adopts vigorous measures for the defense , imports negro strike-breakers , and wins a sharply-contested victory in what has practically come to be a civil war .

		These experiences make of him a fairly clear-sighted man , although they do not blunt his sympa - thies for the toiler ; and he at last comes to his own as a captain of industry , convinced that our very civilization depends upon the assertion of the rights of capital , and firm resistance to the outrageous exactions of union - ism .

		If it had not been for a vein of in - grained obstinacy in his character , he would have made this discovery long before ; as it is , he makes it in time to save his career from shipwreck .

		The love-interest in this narrative is subordinate , but there is a charming hero - ine , and the end of the story finds her in read - iness to share his regenerated life .

		Miss French has given us a book of a very genial and human sort , and brought to it a gift of shrewd and sometimes humorous observation , such as comes only after long practice in the art of fiction .

		The ethical outcome is just , although there are occasions in the course of the action when the ethical balance seems to incline a trifle too much in the direction of a false sentimentalism .

		This general remark , we should say , applies also to Mrs.
Cooke	PERSON	's novel , heretofore considered .

		The present tem - per of unionism in this country is so ugly and its methods so senseless or worse , that now is not the time for trifling or compro - mise , not even the time for over-indulgence in sympathies which might , under differing circumstances , be both legitimate and praise - worthy .

		When the cause of labor shows some inclination to purge itself of its brutal and criminal tendencies , then will be the time to deal with it in a spirit of gentleness and con - ciliation ; until then , society can not too sternly set its face against its propaganda and its methods .

		Melodrama for the times may serve for a description of ` The
Giants	ORGANIZATION	, ' by Mrs.
Fremont Older	PERSON	, a
California	LOCATION	novelist whose work is characterized by a combination of vigor and crudity .

		The hero 's first exploit , as here chronicled , consists in flagging , at the age of fifteen , a limited express train .

		He does it just for the fun of the thing , -- to hear the conductor swear .

		His expectations are fully gratified .

		A little later , his father strikes oil on the ranch , and is fast acquiring a fortune , when the malign operations of the trust de - stroy his prospects , set fire to his property , and send him skyward in an ingeniously con - trived explosion .

		Then the boy registers a Hannibal oath to avenge his father 's murder .

		Going to
New York	LOCATION	, he calls upon the oil magnate , and calmly informs him that his iniquities are soon to have their reward , and that his youthful visitor is to be the agent of the retribution .

		Meanwhile , there is the little matters of college and law-school to be dis - posed of ; and this hurries us through the next few years .

		The youth becomes a famous foot - ball hero , and in due course a lawyer awaiting clients .

		These fail to appear ; but our hero goes into politics , gets a nomination for the office of district attorney , and conducts a re - form campaign on the
East Side	LOCATION	.

		He wins the great heart of the people in this Tammany stronghold , partly by his speeches , but more effectively by his ` laying out ' of the cham - pion slugger who is set upon him .

		He wins the election as a matter of course .

		Then he proceeds to work up a case of bribery against the oil magnate , secures convincing evidence , and lands his victim behind the bars with neat - ness and dispatch .

		The trembling magnate offers half of
his billion dollars	MONEY	and a work - ing partnership if the young man will let him escape ; but to no avail .

		The heroic youth of twenty-three is incorruptible , and villainy at last finds its match .

		There is a lot of * yel - low journalism ' in the story ; there are also two young women , the hero 's good and evil genius respectively .

		The whole narration is pitched in the highest key of sensationalism , and the figures that take part in it have but slight resemblance to real human beings .

		` At the Sign of the
Jack o	PERSON	' Lantern ' is a story in
Miss Myrtle Eeed	LOCATION	's most whimsical vein .

		It abounds in quips and conceits , some of which verge upon genuine humor , while others are of a sort too cheap and hackneyed even for the funny columns of a newspaper .

		The fundam.ental invention of the story is highly amusing .

		A newly-married couple have
1905	DATE	.

		J THE DIAli 309 been left a country home by a deceased and unknown uncle .

		They take possession in the first chapter , and find it a rambling structure of grotesque plan and an unaccountable num - ber of bedrooms .

		In the next chapter their troubles begin , and the bedrooms are accounted for .

		It seems that innumerable parasites in the guise of relatives have been living upon the old man for many years , descending upon him every
summer	DATE	like a swarm of locusts .

		So they come this
summer	DATE	as usual , not know - ing of his demise , and when they learn of it they announce their intention of staying just the same .

		The new owners of the house are too poor-spirited to resist this imposition , and they presently find themselves hosts to as queer a collection of human oddities as were ever gathered under one roof .

		All are of one mind in thinking that the dear departed -LRB- who was a man of mystery -RRB- has left a surprise for them in the shape of concealed treasure , to be found by diligent search ; and they spend much of their time poking into odd comers and digging up the garden .

		In due time the sur - prise comes off ; but it turns out to be other than they had fondly thought .

		That diabolical old man had planned it to come upon them in a most startling way , and besides the injury of blighted prospects , they were forced to suf - fer the insult of hearing certain sober truths spoken about them , as it were , from his grave .

		It seems that he had long endured their intru - sions upon his hospitality , suffering in silence , but planning all the while this posthumous revenge , and leaving his property to the un - known nephew who had been the only one of his relatives to leave him unmolested .

		The story ends with the hurried and indignant departure of the unwelcome guests .

		Miss Eeed has certainly provided us in this instance with an original form of entertainment , and the story should prove popular .

		* The Eeckoning ' is the third in order of publication of the series of four or five ro - mances planned by Mr.
Chambers	PERSON	to treat the American Revolution as it affected northern
New York	LOCATION	and the great landed families of that region .

		When we say that the new work is as good as * Cardigan , ' the first of the series , it is hardly necessary to say more .

		The author brings to the composition of these books a comprehensive acquaintance with the general history of the period , and a minute knowledge of the history and customs of the Iroquois Confederacy , which materials he turns to effective romantic account .

		He gives us historical truth , wholesome excitement , and no small measure of literary art all at once ; and for so much of good it would be churlish not to give thanks .

		` The Fortunes of the Landrays , ' by Mr.
Vaughan Kester	PERSON	, is a novel whose interest , although complicated , is remarkably well sus - tained .

		It begins and ends in an
Ohio	LOCATION	town , and is essentially a picture of life in that community ; but the adventures of certain of its characters take us at times to the far West with the forty-niners , -- to Salt Like City in the early days of
Brigham Young	ORGANIZATION	, to the clos - ing scenes of the Civil War , and to the prairies of
Kansas	LOCATION	.

		The story is one of three gen - erations , not only of the Landrays , but of the other families with whose fortunes theirs are associated .

		This requires of the reader a fre - quent substitution of new interests for old ones ; and the effect is rather bewildering , de - spite the length at which the story is told .

		But although the period of the narrative must extend over upwards of thirty years , the two principal characters remain in view all the time , thus giving the work a unity which oth - erwise it would sadly lack .

		We can not say that Mr.
Kester	PERSON	's characterizations are con - vincing , for the people whom he describes too frequently go off upon tangents , and do unex - pectedly inconsistent things .

		The author tries hard , for example , to make plausible the sud - den transformation of his upright and self - sacrificing hero into a particularly contempti - ble sort of rascal ; but the effort is a failure .

		Nevertheless , the novel contains a great deal of essential truth about life in the time and place chosen for treatment , and its faults of incoherency do not prevent it from being a fairly readable production .

		, Wliile we have no objection to the employ - ment of the labor-and-capital theme in fiction , we think that the author bent upon using it should make his intentions fairly evident at the start .

		In the case of * The Ancient Grudge , ' by Mr.
Arthur Stanwood Pier	PERSON	, we get well into the book before we discover that it is going to be a labor novel .

		Its opening chapters are so innocent of any such purpose , and Mr.
Pier	PERSON	's previous novels have been con - cerned with matters so different , that we are taken fairly by surprise when we find our - selves in the midst of a scene chiefly occupied by labor agitation , walking delegates , strikers , riots , and all the other famiUar features of the present industrial unrest .

		It is all very vig - orously depicted , and the ethical treatment of the situation is sane enough , but the author does not seem to be quite in his element .

		In thus making a ' problem novel ' out of what had better have remained a story of private interest , Mr.
Pier	PERSON	proves rather disappointing .

		The best part of his work is that which is least closely related to the industrial com - plication upon which he depends for his cli - max .

		That joyous romancer , Mr.
A. T. Quiller	PERSON	- 310 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, Couch , in ' The Mayor of Troy / has given us another of his quaint and inimitable tales of the
Cornish	LOCATION	coast .

		The setting is historical , being that of the threatened Napoleonic inva - sion , whereby , indeed , hangs the substance of the tale .

		For the mayor of Troy , who is also major of the volunteer artillery , and a very important person in his bailiwick , becomes the victim of an extraordinary mishap midway in the narrative .

		Snatched by ruthless fate from the scenes of his glory , he is seized by a press - gang , under circumstances which preclude any proof of his identity , and carried off to become an ornament of the
British navy	ORGANIZATION	.

		The ship which bears him is blown up off the French coast ; he is rescued by the enemy , and lan - guishes ten years in a remote military prison .

		Meanwhile , after the mystery of his disap - pearance has defied solution for a sufficient length of days , ' he is given up for dead , his wealth is distributed according to the terms of his will , and Troy does him all sorts of posthumous honors .

		When he returns -- but we will not reveal what happens , remarking only that it is the unexpected .

		The book presents us with one humorous situation after another , crowned by an invention so extraordi - nary that the author may fairly be said to have surpassed his own best previous efforts .

		Mr.
Anthony Hope	PERSON	's latest heroine is an actress with a past .

		We do not learn what that past has been until we are midway in the book , and when the revelation is made it proves rather disappointing .

		It seems that she has a husband , a weak and dissipated person , whom she has left some years before out of sheer disgust .

		But the mere fact of his exist - ence becomes embarrassing when she allows herself to fall in love .

		The love-making , which is the substance of the story , is all very de - corous , and neither of the two persons chiefly concerned takes it with tragic seriousness .

		When the husband turns up , he is seen in his true light by the lover , who promptly hustles him off the scene before the wife has even spoken to him .

		Since she has keyed herself up to the point of willingness to reassume some sort of relations with him his abrupt departure serves as a curious anticlimax .

		Presently the heroine goes to
America	LOCATION	for a professional en - gagement , leaving her lover disconsolate , but not quite sufficiently so to work very deeply upon our sympathies .

		When she returns , it transpires that she has divorced her dissolute consort and married her manager .

		The story is written in a vein of grave comedy , pleasing but not stirring in effect .

		Its half-dozen chief characters are delicately defined , while its dic - tion is an acceptable compound of natural dia - logue , engaging description , and agreeable so - cial philosophy .

		* Patricia : A Mother ' is the latest novel by ` Iota ' -LRB- Mrs.
Caffyn	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The author has made a notable advance in her art since the days of ' A Yellow Aster , ' and has learned to invest a poignant situation with deep human inter - est. .

		When
Patricia	PERSON	's husband dies , her re - maining family consists of a boy and a mother - in-law .

		Of the boy she has seen little , for he has been kept away from her most of the time .

		Of the mother-in-law she has seen , and continues to see , far too much .

		The action of the story mOves about the struggle between mother and mother-in-law to get possession of the boy 's affections .

		The deceased husband had been a man of contemptible character , wearing the mask of hypocrisy so successfully as to appear a true pillar of society , seen in the true light by his wife alone , but respected by the world in general , and idolized by his mother .

		His will has left the widow dependent upon the mother-in-law , placing the former , by that provision coupled with certain vile innuendos , in a suspicious position .

		The sur - rounding county society , which consists largely of cats , hounds the widow to desperation -LRB- this seems to be a bull , but we trust that the mean - ing is clear -RRB- .

		Such is the difficult situation in which
Patricia	PERSON	is placed , and from which , by continence of soul and persistence of pur - pose , she lifts herself above the reach of malice , gets her rightful possession of the boy 's heart , discomfits the exasperating mother-in-law , si - lences the tongues of scandal , and -LRB- not least important in the reckoning -RRB- marries the right man .

		Her story makes a thoroughly interest - ing book .

		` The Gambler ' has not quite the sharpness of interest possessed by ' The Masquerader , ' but it again shows Mrs.
Thurston	PERSON	to be an accomplished artificer of fiction , capable of producing a well-constructed plot and an ani - mated narrative .

		The gambler of the title is a woman , the daughter of a dissipated and impecunious Irishman , who after her father 's death marries an amiable gentleman of some three times her years .

		This step is prompted by mingled sentiments of gratitude and honor , and the child has no idea of what it means .

		Of course there is an awakening .

		It comes when accident throws her into a pleasure-lov - ing set of English people in
Venice	LOCATION	, whose gay worldliness and easy morality fascinate the young wife .

		She is also led to discover that she has an innate passion for gambling , inher - ited from her father , ^ a passion that becomes inordinate when once aroused .

		This leads to dangerous complications , almost to crime and the recklessness of despair .

		Before the full development of this tendency , however , the husband dies as amia , bly as he has lived , and the inevitable yolirig man appears upon the
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAIi 811 scene .

		This is what eventually saves the hero - ine from herself , although only in the nick of time , for her indiscretions are such that she is on the point of drowning herself when he in - tervenes .

		The interest of this book is rather theatrical than real , and we could imagine it turned into a highly effective play .

		William
Moeton Patne	PERSON	.

		Bbtefs ox Netv ^ Books .

		To a reviewer who was privileged f ; `` i ^ `` VameT to hear Mr.
James	PERSON	lecture when he was in this country last
Spring	DATE	, there comes a special interest and delight in reading his two lectures in book-form , in which they are given the title ` The Question of our Speech , and The Lesson of Balzac ' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		Listening to the even flow of sentences so com - plex and elusive , so solidly fraught with unique and weighty thoughts and mannerisms , one 's pleasure was mixed with the constant impression of losing almost as much as one could cull and remember .

		To read these same thoughts , chal - lenging and uplifting in turn , to be able to re - read many of them , as often seems necessary , is to grasp the full purport of the messages , and to realize the logically balanced structure and the fine shadings of thought and diction which char - acterize Mr.
James	PERSON	's work in criticism and in - terpretation .

		In the first essay , delivered as a Commencement Address at
Bryn Mawr	LOCATION	, he has well emphasized the overlooked needs in
America	LOCATION	of * a virtual consensus of educated people to im - part to our speech a coherent culture , ' to estab - lish * a tone standard ' like the criterion of other peoples , to cultivate due regard for the vowel and consonant soimds that are most neglected , and to train our ` tonic possibilities ' so that sweetness and ease , not cheapness , slovenliness , and .

		discord , may characterize our speech .

		The few examples cited are well chosen to illustrate the common looseness of tone even among edu - cated classes ; one smiles with sympathy at his symbolic arraignment of newspaper headlines , in the journals with largest circulation , as ` affect - ing us like the roar of some myriad-faced mon - ster -- as the grimaces , the shouts , shrieks and yells , ranging over the whole gamut of ugliness , irrelevance , dissonance , of a mighty maniac who has broken loose and who is running amuck through the spheres alike of sense and of sound . '

		It would seem as if the place of honor , both in space and title , should be given to the second essay in the volume , ' The Lesson of
Balzac	LOCATION	, ' for it is a notable piece of literary criticism in its concentrated % ` igor , its elucidation of the novel - ist 's art , and its nicety of phrase .

		Recognizing in
Balzac	LOCATION	the master-artist of modern fiction , pausing only for a word now and then of effective comparison with
George Sand	PERSON	,
Zola	ORGANIZATION	,
Meredith	PERSON	, or
Jane Austen	PERSON	, the critic passes rapidly to his evi - dence in favor of his subject and the ` lesson ' which he has accepted , the ` opportunity for a certain intensity of educative practise , ' the ` con - crete active energy , ' the fusion under
Balzac	ORGANIZATION	's hand of all elements of fictional picture , -- charac - ters , motives , and action , -- and , finally , the prod - igality of his genius and its products .

		With ex - cellent imagery he cites the difference to his own mind , -- that of an 'em ulous fellow-worker , ' -- be - tween other novelists and Balzac : ` These are but glimmering lanterns , however , you will say , to hang in the great dusky and deserted avenue that leads up to the seated statue of
Balzac	LOCATION	; and you are so far right , I am bound to admit , as that I place them there , no doubt , in a great measure , just to render the darkness visible . '

		Another passage of allegory that will long remain in memory , is the delicate and keen portrayal of the ` atmosphere , ' the time of day or season of the year , suggested to Mr.
James	PERSON	's mind by the writings of the more familiar novelists of Eng - land and
America	LOCATION	-LRB- pp. 81-83 -RRB- .

		These essays will raise a divergence of opinion , as does all of Mr.
James	PERSON	's literary work ; but however widely readers may differ from his point of view , all will recognize the stimulating intellectual quality .

		A good guide The satisfaction afforded by f aith - to the study ful study and clear treatment of of Pictures .

		facts is the chief pleasure which awaits the reader of Mr.
Charles H. Cafl	PERSON	& n 's ' How to Study Pictures ' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The author possesses unusual qualifications for the work , and holds sound views as to the real nature and fvmc - tion of art .

		He traces the evolution of modern painting , from the Byzantine traditions which pre - vailed before Cimabue down to the latest possi - bilities introduced by the pointilliste method of
Monet	ORGANIZATION	.

		By means of a series of comparisons of paintings and painters , with historical and bio - graphical summaries and appreciations of the pMiinters ' motives and methods , he stimulates in - terest and the faculty of observation ; and he has endeavored to include as many as possible of the motives and methods which from time to time have prevailed , so that the student may gain a basis * of appreciation from which to extend his obser - vations with adequate understanding .

		He has followed the course of painting in different coun - tries , according as it flourished in them simulta - neously , or as it declined in one and appeared with vigor in another .

		He has shown how the manifestations c ^ f art have varied in response to the racial and temporary conditions of each country ; how one impulse or movement followed another , all of them involving truth , but none monopolizing the whole truth ; how ` the manifes - tations and possibilities of painting are wide and various as human nature . '

		While possessing a simplicity of method which conveys to the ave - rage reader a general insight into pictorial meth - ods and motives , the author 's work is character - ized by elegance of style , grace of feeling , and elevation of thought ; it will do as much good in the direct service of art as any treatise pub - lished in recent years .

		In fact , it might be studied to advantage by those to whom is en - trusted the noble charge of founding and man - aging ouv new art museums ; for , as has fre - quently been pointed out , it is not enough that 312 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, those who manage art museums should simply Lave enthusiasm for art , or patriotism , or knowl - edge and skill in the science of general education , or business tact , or money , -- they must also have a clear conception of the real nature of art , its legitimate aims , its capacities and incapacities , its relations to our daily life .

		Relations of That Mr.
Bliss Carman	PERSON	is a poet Nature , Art , of high ideals for his art , yet well and Life .

		-LCB- ^ touch with the main currents of daily life , was shown in his earlier volumes of essays , ` The Kinship of Nature ' and ` The Friendship of Art . '

		To these he has just added a third , ` The Poetry of Life ' -LRB- Page -RRB- .

		That Mr.
Carman	PERSON	is master of a stimulating style in verse and prose alike is evidenced by this sane , hope - ful , yet discriminating study of varied phases of art and life .

		The keynote of optimism is struck near the first paragraph : ` The beauty of the world so outreaches and overcomes all its ugli - ness , is so much more prevalent and vital and persistent . '

		A second pervasive thought is in juxtaposition , -- the necessity of sincerity in life and in art , and the accusation that the insincere artist is ` morally a felon . '

		Much attention is given to the growth of industrial arts , to handi - craft , wMch the Japanese , he asserts , have made almost equal to the fine arts ; and to the decad - ence of the artistic possibilities in the workman under the stress of current mercantile condi - tions .

		Some of the chapters are general in suggestion and elucidation , -- ' The Purpose of Poetry , ' ` How to Judge Poetry , ' ` The Defense of Poetry , ' ` The Permanence of Poetry , ' etc. .

		Other pages are devoted to specific reviews of the poetry of
Browning	PERSON	,
Swinburne	LOCATION	,
Longfellow	LOCATION	, and
James Whitcomb Riley	PERSON	.

		In Mr.
Carman	PERSON	's judg - ment , Mr.
Riley	PERSON	, with his ` wholesomeness , com - mon sense , and conservative cheerfulness , full of sweetest vitality and soundest merriment , ' is the typical American poet of our day .

		Remonstrance and encouragement are well blended in the main by Mr.
Carman	PERSON	.

		If his views on the decadencs of moral standards and tastes seem somewhat extreme , we must remember that they are shared by many a man of practical affairs .

		With the exception of a few extreme statements , the essays are inviting and rewarding to the reader .

		The trend of the volume is definite , -- the endeavor to make art , especially poetry , contribute to the art of living .

		Everyone , argues Mr.
Carman	PERSON	, may be - come an artist ' in the conduct of life , if he will turn his mind to it , cultivating his taste , and , above all , using patient care , ' abjuring haste , fretfulness , and slovenliness of thought and work .

		addition to the ` Heroes of the Na - tions ' series -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		It must be admitted that the founder of Islam is a ` hero ' mostly in the technical sense , to this his most recent bio - grapher .

		Composed in the strictest modem scientific spirit , and buttressed by a formidable list of authorities whose names form short verti - cal columns at the foot of the page , the narrative moves on with a calm and remorseless precision that strips Mohammed of whatever robes of romance our fancy had woven round him , and leaves him scarce rags enough to furnish a suit for
Telephus	ORGANIZATION	.

		His early life in
Meccah	LOCATION	is rapidly sketched up to his thirty-ninth year , when he received his first ` revelation , ' and with equal boldness and caution set about establishing a new faith of whose vast expansion he could of course have no conception .

		The familiar outlines of his career as Prophet are then traced .

		The famous and epoch-making Flight -LRB- which it seems we must spell Hijra instead of Hegira -RRB- in Sep - tember , 622 , to Yathrib -LRB-

Meccah	PERSON	; the extension of his power over the inhabited parts of the great peninsula , -- all these periods are examined with care and candor .

		Full recognition is accorded to the genius of the organizer and leader ; while his many foibles are exposed with a grave sarcasm not unworthy of
Gibbon	PERSON	.

		After following with deepening interest Mr.
Margoliouth	PERSON	's philosophic inquiry , most readers will understand and accept his estimate of Mohammed as the possessor of a genius ' equal to the emergencies but not too great for them ' ; and as endowed , ` beneath the mask of the enthusiast , with the sanest and soundest common-sense . '

		For all those Having appeared in many previous who love the volumes as a guide to practical outdoor world .

		Wholly un - professional and undidactic , these four essays , on ` The Realm of the Commonplace , ' ` Country and

		They are the delightful , self-revealing conversation of a good teacher off duty .

		In his love of the commonplace , Mr.
Bailey	PERSON	is a follower of Whitman , -- a man who ` believes in the weather ' and ` preaches the soil , the sky , and the people who labor . '

		Moreover , while his heart is easily toward the country , his mind is open toward the city .

		He is wise enough to see that ` the repose of the nature-lover and the assi - duous exertion of the man of affairs are comple - mentary , not antithetical , states of mind . '

		He is , besides , an ardent idealist even in matters of education ; for although he exposes with pitifvd clearness the poverty and inefficiency of the dis - trict schools in which nearly half the younger children of the land are being under-educated , he believes that the schools both of city and country will soon come into closer contact with real life .

		` In an agricultural community , for example , ' he says , ' all the farms of the neighbor - hood will afford training in the elements of failure and success .

Green	ORGANIZATION	's characterization of
Milton	LOCATION	as * the ideal Puritan . '

		The lapse of years has left us in the p > oet 's works the noblest inter - pretation of the ideals of that movement in Eng - land which stood for larger individualism and seriousness of life .

		Upon this conception of Mil - ton , Mr.
Tudor Jenks	PERSON	has added to his volumes on
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	and Shakespeare another under the title , * In the Days of
Milton	PERSON	' -LRB-
A. S. Barnes &	ORGANIZATION	do . -RRB-

		.

		This book gives a vivid sense of reality to the stirring period from the accession of
James I.	PERSON	to the death of
Milton	LOCATION	in
1674	DATE	.

		Out of a wide range of reading the author has brought together the most significant details for graphic statement , and has skilfulh ' interwoven the career of Mil - ton as a man , as a controversialist , and as a poet .

		The sturdy and reflective Puritan character is presented in wide contrast to that of the gay and pleasure-loving Cavalier .

		The protracted politi - cal and religious controversy culminating in the ci ^ - il war , the storj ' of the
Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	, and the restoration of royalty , are pictured with an intelligent sense of their composite effect on the mind and work of the poet .

		The treatment of Milton throughout the narrative is sympathetic .

		The author is luminous rather than critical , gives a touch of imagination to the accuracy of facts , and inspires with fresh human interest a national movement commonly thought of as only bitter and austere .

		More light on Recent startling events in
Russia	LOCATION	Darke ` sVB ^ ` sia .

		l ^ ^ d unexpected timeliness to the work of Konni Zilliacus on ` The Russian Revolutionary Movement ' -LRB- Button -RRB- .

		The book was written with the special object of en - lightening public opinion in
Finland	LOCATION	upon the history of the revolutionary movement in
Russia	LOCATION	; and it has been translated for Anglo-Saxon read - ers by the authority and at the request of the author .

		The
Finnish Grand Duchy	ORGANIZATION	has been loyal to the Tsar because the Tsars have been loyal to their pledge to maintain the political rights of the Finns : and that people have been largely ignorant of the repressive and cruel policy car - ried out in the rest of the Russian Empire .

		But after ninety years of peaceful relations , the fool - ish advisors of the present Tsar persuaded him , in the interest of the autocratic principle , to ex - tend that system over
Finland	LOCATION	; and he weakly consented to violate his solemn promise and the promises of his predecessors , and took away from the Finns their cherished political rights and at - tempted to annihilate their nationality .

		The gal - lant struggle that the Finns have made , to which recent events give promise of success , is known to all the world .

		Since no outside eountrv could be looked to for help in this struggle , the lead - ers turned to the men and parties within the em - pire that were carrying on a s imil ar struggle for political rights .

		The book gives an account of the patriotic efforts that have led to thousands of martyrdoms and to the cruelties that have at - tended the government policy of repression .

		The story of the long protracted struggle is told with self-control , with fairness , and with effect .

		After a brief statement of the origins of the revolu - tionarj ' movement in the attempts of Peter the Great and
Catherine IE	PERSON	.

		to
Europeanize Russia	LOCATION	, and from the mingling of the Russian armies with those of
Western Europe	LOCATION	in the campaigns against
Najwleon	ORGANIZATION	, the author proceeds to give a detailed account of the growth of the movement under each ruler since that time .

		Though the ac - count is that of an avowed opponent of the gov - ernment , the author carries the reader with him by his evident desire to keep to the facts of his - tory , and by his freedom from denunciation and bitterness .

		The account is of absorbing interest , and may well be read by all who desire to obtain an inside view of the underlying causes of present conditions in
Russia	LOCATION	.

		The developments from day to day , astounding as they are , accord well with the prophecies of this author .

		Cort a her nd ^ ® '' ® ^ ^ ^ indications that Mr. raOerof

Frederick A. Ober	PERSON	's `
Hernando Cortes	PERSON	, Conqueror of
Mexico	LOCATION	' -LRB-
Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is first of a series of small volumes on the ` Heroes of
American History	ORGANIZATION	' ; but whether the lives of other heroes are to be prepared by Mr.
Ober	PERSON	, or by other writers , does not appear .

		There are , furthermore , some ` in - ternal evidences , ' as a ` higher critic ' might say , that Mr.
Ober	PERSON	's book is written for the entertain - ment of youthful readers .

		Readable it certainly is , to one who is not fastidious regarding the his - torical accuracy of the book he is reading .

		And the author makes it clear that he finds little jus - tification for the most important acts of his hero .

		But as an account of the economic conditions which existed in
Mexico	LOCATION	at the time of the raid of Cortes , of the Aztecs , and of their ` civiliza - tion , ' it is an exaggerated following of the ultra -
Romantic School	ORGANIZATION	of American historians .

		And it suggests the question , whether or not an ac - curate account of the conditions prevailing in
Tenochtitlan	LOCATION	in the early part of the sixteenth century , and of the subversion of the Aztecs by the Spanish freebooters at that time , could not be made as entertaining to minds , either youthful or mature , as the fanciful accounts usuaUy given of the series of incidents which go by the name of ` The Conquest of
Mexico	LOCATION	. '

		An excellent handbook for those who are interested in the finer problems of photography is Mr.
Snell	PERSON	's ` The Camera in the Fields ' -LRB-
A. Wessels Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The fact that the book is an English pub - lication does not lessen its usefulness , for the directions about lenses , rests , shutters , focusing , backgrounds , etc. , are so clearly given as to be easily adapted to cameras of different makes .

		After careful direction ?

		about all the details of nature and the camera .

		314 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, field work , and the development of plates , the author devotes separate chapters to the problems of ornithology , zoology , entomology , and botany .

		The photographs with which the book is illus - trated are as cosmopolitan as the camera itself , for such exquisite touches of nature make the whole world kin .

		It is scarcely gracious to choose among such beauties ; but perhaps the most admir - able is that of a bedewed spider 's web , in which not only each strand , but nearly every dew-drop , is distinctly perfect .

		Possibly some readers will suffer ` zero at the bone ' because of the pictures of snakes ; if so , they can turn the pages until orchids and moths and anemones restore them .

		The author passes over with a few modest words the thought that such advanced photography will soon revolutionize text-books and affect all scien - tific study .

		But the reader gladly pauses to won - der whither such possibilities will lead .

		If an album of beautiful pictures can be made for the study of each tree , and if the life-history of each insect , even to the instant when the chrysalis opens to free the butterfly , can be presented to the eye in permanent form , our knowledge of the world about us will soon grow to delightful inti - macy .

		The name of
G. Lowes Dickinson	PERSON	is not so familiar to American as to English readers , who associate it closely with the ' New Paganism ' of which Wal - ter Pater was the prophet .

		A Modern Symposium ' -LRB- Mc -
Clure , Phillips & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the latest work from his pen .

		It purports to be an account of a meeting of philosophers representing all the various po - litical and social systems of the world .

		The Conservative , the Radical , the Socialist , the An - archist , the Scientist , the Poet , and many more , each pleads his own cause .

		The closing speaker , noted simply as a man of letters , distinctly rep - resents Mr.
Dickinson	PERSON	's theories of life , and at - tempts to sum up all the virtues of all the other systems .

		The sneers at the persons who hurry into historical writing might have been written after reading a list of books on the Spanish war by the heroes who took part in it -- vicariously and otherwise .

ITALY	LOCATION	, in her delightful
Browning	PERSON	-
Florence	LOCATION	volume , published last year , Mrs.
McMahan	PERSON	showed her thorough familiarity with
Italy	LOCATION	and her appreciation of poetic atmosphere .

		This new volume is quite the equal of the other in these charming qualities .

		The romantic character of
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	's life , especially in
Italy	LOCATION	, and the pictorial beauty of the background which provided his inspiration , supply unequalled material for an illustrated book of this kind .

		Mrs.

		The result is a volume of notable interest and exceptional beauty , with over sixty illustrations from photographs .

		It is hardly necessary to say that Mrs.
McMahan	PERSON	's admirable ``
Florence	LOCATION	in the Poetry of the Brownings '' is quite as acceptable this season as last .

		Best of all , his whole book breathes a freshness and a joy of living that , quite apart from its subject matter , are decidedly engaging .

		The already established popularity of the work in
France	LOCATION	is indicated by the fact that it passed into a seventh edition a few months after its publication , and it has received from the French Academy the Montyon prize .

		The good literary style of the English version , made by the Abbe himself , and the highly entertaining character of the narrative , will no doubt make it a favorite in this country also . ''

		Professor Small 's answer is that the work of co-ordi - nating these various groups , of surveying the process of human associa - tion as a whole , is a task distinct from that of a worker in one of the special fields , and that the body of knowledge so gained legitimately ranks as a science .

		In other words , sociology is to social science in general what neurology is to medicine .

		It is addressed to historians - economists , political scientists , psychologists , and moralists , quite as much as to sociologists .

		NOTES 390 THE SEASON 'S BOOKS FOR THE YOUNG 392 A classified , descriptive guide to the children 's books of the present season .

		TOPICS IN LEADING PERIODICALS 396 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 896 BOOKS AND SHOES .

		There is so much of practical wisdom in Mr.
Henry Holt	PERSON	's paper on ' The Commercialization of Literature / upon which some comments were made in our last issue , that we are inclined to turn to it again for a text , in order to say some - thing more upon the vexed question of advertis - ing .

		The methods to which some publishers have resorted of recent years seem to be so con - spicuously lacking in good sense , and so injuri - ous to the best interests both of publishing and of literature , that nothing could be more timely than the protest to which Mr.
Holt	PERSON	has given so emphatic and authoritative an expression .

		Do the principles that apply to the advertis - ing of shoes apply also to the advertising of books ?

		This is a question that would hardly seem to need discussion were it not for the obvious fact that books have come of late to be advertised in just that fashion -- by the full - page display in the daily newspaper , by the circus poster , by the flaring street-car sign , and by the perambulating sandwich-man .

		It is amazing that any person in his right mind should think such methods likely to promote sales in a measure at all proportional to the outlay .

		For one book that will benefit by this vulgar sort of appeal there must be a score , or a hundred , that will lose , and the publisher who resorts to it is at best taking a gambling chance of the most reckless sort .

		One of them , when questioned directly , is quoted as replying : ` No , 1 sha n't get the money back directly , but it will give authors a great idea of my enterprise , and I may get one or two big ones to pay for it . '

		` Now the shores of bookland are fairly strewn with the wrecks of publishing craft that have been fitted out and launched with a view to giving the public a great idea of their enter - prise , and the skippers , no doubt , such of them as have survived , are wishing that they had thought more of seaworthiness and less of show .

		* There is the advertising that appeals to the eye , ' says Mr.
Holt	PERSON	, ' and the advertising that appeals to the intelligence . '

		The former kind of advertising is effective with products that everyone is likely to use , such as patent medi - cines , food stuffs , and articles of clothing .

		It ' shapes popular habit , ' independently of deliber - ation : ' everybody has eyes , and everybody uses food and shoes ; so this kind of advertising may take root anywhere , and it pays to scatter it . '

		How different the problem becomes when books are in question is obvious at the first glance .

		Most of the people who buy shoes do not buy THE DIAL , -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, books at all , while of those who are occasional purchasers of books , few spend as much upon them as they do upon shoes .

		Nor will * the advertising that appeals to habit ' have much influence over these few ; the habit of buying a particular kind of shoe may be fixed by the reiterated appeal of the advertiser to the eye , but we can not imagine such an effect in the case of a particular book .

		Who ever acquired the habit of buying copies of ` Trilby / or *
Eben Holden	PERSON	/ or ' The Crisis ' year after year ?

		The essential difference between the two cases is , of course , that a man may continue to buy and wear out shoes for a lifetime , while it takes but a single copy of a book to supply forever his individual demand for it .

		This fact should be well within the grasp of a child in the kinder - garten stage of development , yet we frequently witness the effort of some publishers to advertise a book as if he were aiming to create for it a permanent class of customers . '

		It takes longer than most books live to advertise into a paying reputation even a shoe or .

		a soap , ' but the expenditure may justify itself in the long run ; a book , on the other hand , can not hold its mar - ket for any length of time , and its advertiser must get back his outlay at once , or charge it to his profit and loss account .

		For soon the book which he has sought to advertise into fame has become but a book of yesteryear , and finds no one to bestow a thought upon it .

		We suppose that there is , roughly speaking , in any community , at any given time , a ` book fund , ' just as there is a ' shoe fund , ' or , pace the newer economists , a ' wages fund . '

		Each new book seeks to get as large a share of that fund for itself as it may , and to some extent , no doubt , the persistent flaunting of a particular title in the eyes of the public will divert in that direction a certain number of dollars whose course is not absolutely predestined by the taste and intelligence of their possessors .

		But for each dollar that is thus captured by advertising of the random and vulgar sort , two are likely to be spent in the effort , and that game is surely not worth the candle .

		As for the book buyer who applies taste and intelligence to his pur - chases , we may be sure that he will not be lured by any of the devices of puffery , but will hold in just suspicion the sensational methods of broadside and poster advertising , and ask only to be informed , with reasonable distinctness of exposition , through the medium of the accred - ited organs of bookish intelligence , concerning the present and forthcoming output of litera - ture .

		It can not be too often asserted that a book is an individual thing , and that a person who wants it , if he have any intelligent reason whatever for his desire , will not accept another book as a satisfactory substitute .

		This also seems to be a sufficiently elementary proposition , yet failure to recognize its truth has worked much mischief , in witness whereof may be adduced not only the economic waste of reckless advertising now under consideration , but also the standing disgrace of our national import duty upon English books .

		The craze for book advertising of the undis - criminating sort has probably passed its culmin - ation .

		It was encouraged a few years ago by the appearance of a number of phenomenal ` sellers ' of the poorer grade of fiction .

		Two or three singularly worthless books were boosted above the six-figure mark by patent medicine methods of exploitation , and the spectacle made many publishers lose their heads .

		Fortunately , there have been no ` sellers ' for a year or two past , and there are indications of an awakening to soberness in the publishing business .

		Two effects of the reign of the ' seller ' are pointed out by Mr.
Holt	PERSON	.

		One is that bookselling has fallen largely into the hands of the department stores , since ' any '' saleslady '' can identify and sell a '' seller '' as well as the most accomplished bibliopole ' ; the other is that ' the mad quest of the golden '' seller '' ... reacts to crush out ' the sale of all other books .

		Now if there are any two tendencies that are likely to prove ruinous in the long run to the business of publishing , they are precisely these two that have been operative of late .

		Book stores must be preserved and strengthened if publishing is to continue to bear its old relation to popular culture , if it is even to exist in continued secur - ity and dignity .

		And the books that never can become ' sellers ' must not be slighted because their modest sales make so poor a showing beside the dazzling success of some book that popular caprice has brought into an ephemeral vogue .

		He is a short-sighted publisher indeed who does not do his best to oppose the inroads of the department store upon the business of book - selling , and who does not realize that the lasting strength of his own position must depend almost absolutely upon his control , not of an occasional ' seller ' to be forgotten the year after publica - tion , but of a long list of books of the kind that keep on selling to a moderate extent year after vear .

		THE EVOLUTION OF ' MOTHER OOOSE . ' '

		Mother Goose ' is the starting-point from which mankind begins its knowledge of books .

		The novelist whose latest volume is in its hun - dreds of thousands , and whose name is in the mouths of the multitude , gained his first notion of fiction on his mother 's knee from the some - what highly colored story of the old woman who swept the cobwebs out of the sky ; the poet 's first
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		367 pastoral was ' Little Bo Peep / his first tragedy * Ding Dong Bell / These nursery rhymes have trained the ear and stirred the imagination of generations of children , and are worthy of adult consideration not only because of their venerable antiquity but also because of their peculiar fas - cination for the child mind .

		As for Mother
Groose	PERSON	the author , we must con - sign her to the realm of myths ; for she appears to be even less substantial than Homer .

		Some forty years ago , an ingenious gentleman of Bos - ton claimed to have identified her as
Mistress Elizabeth Goose	ORGANIZATION	, or Vergoose , who flourished in that city between the years
1712	DATE	and
1720	DATE	; and this effort to give her a local habitation was at once accepted with joy by a large part of that reading public which expects of its authors concrete physical existence .

		The Vergoose story stated that our nursery laureate was the mother-in-law of one
Thomas Fleet	ORGANIZATION	, a printer ; that she lived with his family over his shop in Pudding Lane -LRB- now Devonshire Street -RRB- ; that she habitually repeated nursery rhymes and songs for the delectation of
Fleet	ORGANIZATION	's children , and that said verses became so popular in Pudding Lane that Fleet , thinking to turn an honest penny , published them in
1719	DATE	under the now famous title , ' Mother
Groose	PERSON	's Melodies . '

		The story was uncontradicted for years , but at last the higher critics got hold of it and exploded it .

		If we are to seek the genesis of ' Mother Goose , ' we must go farther than
Boston	LOCATION	and earlier than
1719	DATE	.

		Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	has dis - covered in
Loret	LOCATION	's ' La Muse Historique , ' pub - lished in
France	LOCATION	in
1650	DATE	, the following verses : Mais le Cher motif de leur
Joye	PERSON	, Comme un conte de la MSre Dye , Se Trouvant fabuleux et faux , lis devlendront tous blen p ^ nauts .

		The second line isthe significant one : ` Lake a Mother Goose story , ' which , in the next line , is shown to be ' fabuleux et faux . '

		Clearly , then .

		Mother Goose was known to the French more than two hundred years ago , as the typical teller of extraordinary and fanciful tales .

		The earliest date at which
Mother Goose	ORGANIZATION	appears as the author of children 's stories is
1697	DATE	, when
Charles Perrault	PERSON	, a distinguished French litterateur , published in
Paris	LOCATION	a little book of tales which he had during that and the preceding year contributed to a magazine known as the * Eecueil , ' printed at The Hague .

		This lx > ok is entitled ' Histoire ou Contes du Tems Passe , avec des Moralites , ' and has a frontispiece in which is pictured an old woman telling stories to a family group by the fireside , while in the background are the words in large characters , ' Contes de ma IMere I ` Oye ' -- ` Tales of my Mother Goose . '

		These tales were eight in num - ber , consisting of the following : ' Little Red Eiding Hood , ' ` The Sisters who dropped from their Mouths Diamonds and Toads , ' ` Blue - beard , ' ' The Sleeping Beauty , ' ' Puss in Boots , ' ' Cinderella . ' '

		Eiquet with the Tuft , ' and * Tom Thumb ' -- or ` Little Thumb ' -LRB- Petit Poucet -RRB- as he is here called . '

		Eiquet with the Tuft ' is the only one of the collection which seems not to have maintained its popularity in .

		English and American collections .

		It is thus clear that Mother Goose was of French extraction and of at least respectable antiquity .

		But thus far nothing has been heard of her ' Melodies . '

		She began her existence as the raconteur of fairy tales , not as the nursery poetess .

		The idea of collecting well-known rhymes for children and of attributing them to this fabulous story-teller seems to have originated with
John ^ sTewbery	PERSON	, the
London	LOCATION	publisher , who has been justly styled the father of children 's literature in
England	LOCATION	; and it is more than probable that
Oliver Goldsmith	PERSON	edited the first collection .

		This book , which was entitled ' Mother Goose 's
Mel	PERSON	- ody , ' appeared not much later than 1760 .

		`` We know that
Goldsmith	PERSON	did hack-work for New - bery during five or six years at about this period , that he wrote the child 's story of ' Goody Two Shoes , ' which
Newbery	ORGANIZATION	published in
1765	DATE	, and that he was interested in children 's literature .

		Certain earmarks , too , are to be found in the preface to the ` Melody , ' which suggest his authorship .

		Probably no original copy of the
Newbery ` Mother Goose	ORGANIZATION	' is now in existence , but the book was reprinted by
Isaiah Thomas	PERSON	of
Worcester	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, about
1785	DATE	, and several copies of the
Worcester	LOCATION	edition are preserved , one of which has been photographed and reproduced in facsimile by Mr.
W. H. Whitmore	PERSON	of
Boston	LOCATION	.

		Other publishers also reprinted the Newbery col - lection .


John Marshall	PERSON	, of
Aldermary Church	ORGANIZATION	- yard , Bow Lane ,
London	LOCATION	, brought out an edition in which he followed Kewbery almost verbatim , making only a few changes in the arrangement of the selections .

		A copy of the
Marshall	PERSON	edition , is still extant in the Bodleian Library at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		In
1797	DATE	a quaint satirical booklet was printed in
London	LOCATION	entitled ` Infant Institutes . '

		This seems to have been an essay on nursery litera - ture , written in a mock-scholarly style , with comments on a number of jingles then evidently current , -- intended probably as a burlesque upon the work of the Shakespearean commentators of that day .

		The ' Infant Institutes ' contained a number of nursery rh -RCB- Tnes , some of which had not been printed in ` Mother Goose , ' but we hear of no other general collection until
1810	DATE	.

		In this year appeared '
Gammer Gurton	PERSON	's Gar - land , or The Nursery Parnassus , ' edited by
Joseph Eitson	PERSON	, an eminent scholar , critic , and 868 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	^ antiquary , who gave much attention to the origin and development of English ballad poetry . '

		Gammer Gurton ' was evidently put out as a rival of * Mother Goose . '

		The name was a familiar one , found originally in the old comedy , *
Gammer Gurton	PERSON	's Needle , ' but used as a type of the ancient grandmother .

		This alliterative '
Garland	PERSON	' contained nearly all of * Mother Goose 's Melody , ' and about as much more ma - terial of the same sort , collected by Eitson from all available sources .

		Gammer Gurton 's reign , however , was short , and it is to a
Boston	LOCATION	pub - lisher that we look for the final establishment of Mother Goose as the autocrat of the nursery .

		At some time between
1824	DATE	and
1827	DATE	,
Munroe	PERSON	and
Francis	PERSON	, a firm of
Boston	LOCATION	booksellers doing business at what is now the corner of Washing - ton and Water streets , published a book called * Mother Goose 's Quarto , or Melodies Complete , ' and in
1833	DATE	their successors ,
C. S. Francis & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, brought out a much larger book , the title page of which reads ' Mother Goose 's Melodies : The only Pure Edition . '

		Though this is adver - tised as ' pure Mother Goose , ' and though it con - tains all but three of the original rhymes of
Newbery	ORGANIZATION	's edition , there is a plentiful alloy of '
Gammer Gurton	PERSON	, ' and of other rhymes which had escaped both authorities .

		In fact , *
Gammer Gurton	PERSON	' is at this point absorbed and loses her identity in ' Mother Goose . '

		The
Munroe	PERSON	and
Francis	PERSON	edition has recently been reprinted in facsimile , with an introduction by Dr.
Edward Everett Hale	PERSON	.

		The last notable addition to nursery litera - ture was made in
1842	DATE	, when
Halliwell	PERSON	, the well - known British scholar and Shakespearean critic , published ` The Nursery Rhymes of
England	LOCATION	, ' which his title announced were ' collected prin - cipally from oral tradition , ' but which contained nearly all of ' Mother Goose , ' '
Gammer Gurton	PERSON	, ' and the
American Consolidated Mother Goose	ORGANIZATION	, besides much new material which the collector might well have allowed to remain oral tradi - tion .

		It is the most complete collection of nurs - ery rhymes ever published , and is interesting to the student of folk-lore , though not altogether profitable to the child .

		Much of it is coarse , a great deal of it is silly , and , unfortunately , the coarsest and silliest of it has been published ad nauseam in modern editions , to the lasting shame and humiliation of the mythical dame to whom it is now all attributed .

		The fact is worthy of note that among col - lectors and editors of nursery rhymes are to be found the brightest of scholars and litterateurs , --
Goldsmith	PERSON	,
Eitson	PERSON	, and
Halliwell	PERSON	;
Andrew Lang	PERSON	, who edited in
1884	DATE	perhaps the best chil - dren 's collection of jingles now obtainable ; Mr.
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	, who made the collection contained in Book I. of the ' Heart of Oak Series ' ; Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	, editor of the Eng - lish volume , ' National Ehymes of the
Nursery	ORGANIZATION	' ; and Mr.
Charles Welsh	PERSON	, one of the best authori - ties on children 's literature in this country to - day .

		Thus far we have traced simply the printed existence of these rhymes , -- the bibliographical history of them .

		But when we go back of all that and attempt to discuss when and where and how they first came into being , we open a wide field of exploration , -- as wide as the world it - self , and as old as history .

		Take for example ' The House that
Jack Built	PERSON	. '

		This originated , unquestionably , in an old accumulative bit of verse found in the Chaldee and also in the
Hebrew	LOCATION	.

		The rhymes , ' Hush-a-bye baby upon the tree top ' -LRB- originally ' Sing , lullaby baby , ' etc. -RRB- and ' Eock-a-bye baby thy cradle is green , ' both suggest a pastoral out-of-door life , and are of great antiquity .

		The first is quoted in a song called ' ^
The London Medley	ORGANIZATION	, ' printed in
1744	DATE	.

		The same song also contains ' Old Obadiah sings Ave Maria , ' and ' There was an old woman sold puddings and pies . ' '

		Old King
Cole	PERSON	' was an historical character , who ruled the Britons in the
third century	DATE	A. D. ; Eobert of
Gloucester	LOCATION	says he was the father of
St. Helena	ORGANIZATION	, and hence the grandfather of Constantine . '

		Jack and
Jill	PERSON	' is drawn from Icelandic mythology .

		The two children were supposed to have been stolen and taken up into the moon , where they still stand with the pail of water between them ; and the Scandinavian peasant will point them out to you on a clear night when the moon is at the full , as we point out to our children ' the man in the moon . '

		A myth almost identical with this is found in the
San	LOCATION	- skrit .

		The first line of ' Sing a song of sixpence ' is quoted in
Beaumont	LOCATION	and
Fletcher	PERSON	's ' Bon - duoa ' -LRB- about 1615 -RRB- . '

		A duck and a drake and a half penny cake ' appears in Junius 's ' No - menclator , '
London	LOCATION	,
1585	DATE	. '

		When a twister , a twisting will twist him in a twist ' is in Dr.
Wal	PERSON	- lis 's '
Grammatica Linguae Anglicanae	PERSON	,
Oxon	LOCATION	.

		1G74 . ' '

		Three Blind Mice ' is in a book called the ' Deuteromelia , ' published in
London	LOCATION	in
1609	DATE	with music accompanying . '

		Handy - dandy , Jack-a-dandy ' is a rhyme the repeating of which was part of an old game -- centuries old ; it is referred to in ' Piers Ploughman ' -LRB- 1369 -RRB- .

		Many of the popular nursery rhymes are his - torical .

		Several of these have already been referred to . '

		Over the water and over the sea And over the water to
Charley	LOCATION	, ' was an old Jacobite song , sung many a time in
Scotland	LOCATION	at
midnight	TIME	meetings in the alehouses while waiting for '
Bonnie Prince Charley	PERSON	. ' '

		Charley loves good ale and wine ' was another
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 369 drinking-song of the same period , -- some say a part of the same song , though that is doubt - ful .

		It also refers to the
Young Pretender	ORGANIZATION	.

		Eeferences to these historical rh -RCB- Tnes might be multiplied indefinitely .

		There is * Please to remember the Fifth of
November	DATE	, ' referring to the gunpowder plot ; there is the ` black man upon the black horse / who was Charles the First ; there is ' Hector Protector , dressed all in green ' ; there is ' The Parliament Soldiers ' who are said to have * gone to the
King	LOCATION	. '

		Then there is the rhyme *
London Bridge	LOCATION	is falling do ^ - n. ' which celebrates an event in the early part of the eleventh century , when
King Olaf	PERSON	, the Norseman , went to
England	LOCATION	and broke down
London Bridge	ORGANIZATION	after a battle with
King Ethelred	ORGANIZATION	.

		The victorv ' found a place in the Norse sagas , and the following lines from the '
Heimskringla	PERSON	' evidently formed the basis of the nursery rh -RCB- ` me : * London Bridge Is broken down , Gold is won and bright renown ;
Shields	PERSON	resounding , `` War horns sounding , Hildur shouting in the din .

		Arrows singing .

		Mail coats ringing ,
Odin	PERSON	makes our Olaf win . '

		As one looks back over the history of these old rh \ Tnes , he is filled with wonder at their vitality .

		Century after century has passed over them , and they still find a place in every nur - sery -- a c-omer in the heart of every child .

		Many verses for children have been written in modem times which to the adult mind seem more melodious and attractive , but the child looks upon them with more or less of coldness .

		They may amuse him for a time , but after all it is his ' Mother
Groose	PERSON	' that he takes to bed with him .

		He knows nothing of its antiquity or of its history .

		He does not know why he likes it , -- he simply likes it .

		A story is told of the daughter of
Horace Mann	PERSON	, who during the tender years of baby - hood was studiously kept away from the cor - rupting influence of all nursen , ' nonsense , and brought up in an eminently proper intellectual environment .

		When she had become quite a large girl , she heard one day , for the first time , * High-diddle-diddle , ' and was so fascinated by it that she begged to have it repeated to her until she could learn it .

		This story proves not only the futility of keeping children in a strait - jacket , but also the inherent attraction of Mother Goose , aside from all possibilities of as - sociation or training .

		What is the secret of this ever-fresh and ever - enduring popularity ?

		Some thoughtful per - sons have claimed to find in the old rhymes hints of profound philosophy , which they think is the preservative principle that has kept them through the centuries .

		Mrs.
Whitney	PERSON	, in her deliciously extravagant * Mother
Groose	PERSON	for Grown Folks , ' has found them fairly bristling with morals .

		She sees in ' Little Boy Blue ' an exhortation to youth to shake off indolence and apply himself to duty ; ` Little
Jack Horner	PERSON	' she conceives to be a satire on the egotism of the successful man ; ' Little Bo Peep ' offers com - fort to the disappointed ; '
Solomon Grundy	PERSON	' is the epitome of life -- a simpler and more di - rect form of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's ' Seven Ages . ''

		The Old Woman who ` lived upon nothing but victuals and drink ' shows the longing of the tmsatisfied soul after things spiritual ; '
Jack Sprat	PERSON	and his Wife ' illustrates the complementary character of human endowments , each being fitted to its place in the economy of nature .

		It is perhaps true that Mrs.
Whitney	PERSON	's corollaries are drawn more in jest than in earnest , but other com - mentators have made a ridiculously serious matter of it .

		We must remember that the pop - ularity of ' Mother Goose ' springs from the child himself , -- and what child has any vital concern as to the lesson in ` Little Boy Blue ' ?

		If he suspected a lesson in it , he would straight - way lose interest .

		Neither is it the wit or humor that appeals to the child .

		Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	tells of an acquaintance who used to be mightily amused at the line , ' Hotum , potum , paradise tantum , peri - meri-dictum , domine , ' in which he said the phrase , ' Paradise tantum ' -LCB- only paradise -RRB- was the nicest thing he knew .

		It is probable that whoever first evolved this choice pig-Latin had no thought of doing a particularly nice thing , but perhaps wanted to burlesque some old Latin formula used by the priests .

		At aU events , the child sees nothing witty in it , -- the jingle is what attracts him .

		The child takes little thought as to what any of these verses mean .

		There are perhaps four elements in them that appeal to him , -- first , the jingle , and with it that peculiar cadence which modern writers of children 's poetry strive in vain to imitate ; second , the nonsense , with just enough of sense in it to connect the nonsense with the child 's thinkable world ; third , the ac - tion , -- for the stories are quite dramatic in their way ; and fourth , the quaintness .

		Many of the objects which are referred to are entirely uninteresting to him in themselves , -- many of them entirely strange and beyond his horizon ; and perhaps this quality of mystery also adds to them a certain charm .

		No child knows ex - actly what it was that Little Miss Muffet sat on , and it is an interesting experiment to get from a dozen average children their ideas on this sub - ject .

		The conceptions range aU the way from a rocking-chair to a mushroom ; and I have observed that the artists who illustrate ' Mother Goose ' are as far apart in their views as the 370 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, children .

		What does interest the child is the rhyme and the swing of the metre . '

		Spider ' and ` beside her ' fall on his ear quite pleasantly .

		Then he has a vague feeling of sympathy or of contemptuous pity for the heroine , conditioned upon his own relations with spiders in general .

		I remember , in my childhood , passing through both the sympathetic and contemptuous stages , -- the first , a quite delightful sort of terror which made me half fear to hear the story ; the second , a complacent pleasure which grew out of the consciousness of weakness overcome .

		What was it that so attracted
Horace Mann	PERSON	's daughter in ' High-diddle-diddle ' ?

		First , un - doubtedly , the metre , which is a waltz move - ment , suggesting all the abandon of the un - usual scene which it celebrates , -- this empha - sized by the alliteration in the first two lines , like the beat of some barbaric tom-tom .

		There is , too , an excellent set of rhymes , except in the emasculated modern version which substitutes * sport ' for the good old English word ' craft , ' -- meaning skill , strength , and courage , -- and thereby destroys the verse and the idea as well .

		Then , there is the very intoxication of move - ment ; everyone is doing something .

		And finally , there is the absolute nonsense of it all .

		I do not wonder that the verse has lasted three hundred years or so , -- and it is good for at least three hundred more , unless children grow too wise to love absurdities and too proper to feel the swing of a half-savage melody .

		Many good people have tried to improve ' Mother Goose . '

		A familiar story is that of the
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	who revised ' High-diddle-diddle ' for his little
Mary	PERSON	, making the cow to jump under the moon , the little dog to larh rather than laugh , and the cat to run after the spoon -- the dish being debarred from such action on ac - count of the manifest impossibility of running without legs .

		It is not recorded how little Mary received the emendations , but it may be in - ferred that she did not highly approve of them .

		Every attempt to alter ' Mother Goose ' for the better has resulted in failure .

		To try to make her sensible is to destroy a chief element of her charm .

		To modernize her is to lose that quaint flavor of things half understood and wholly unusual , which appeals to every child .

		To expurgate her and try to make of her a moral teacher is to relegate her to the dust-bin .

		Some things there are in the old editions which are coarse to modern ears , and judicious editors wisely omit them ; but on the whole there is lit - tle danger that the rising generation will have its morals or its taste debased by this old clas - sic .

		To trifle with ' Mother Goose ' is like trifling with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		We have no men or women living nowadays who can improve upon her .

		* In what
Tennyson	PERSON	called the ` dawn-golden time ' at
Cambridge	LOCATION	, there flourished a famous company of gifted youths , the cream of whom , we know as the ' Apostles , ' who almost without exception wrote poetry , of more or less merit ; and of this choice coterie
William Henry Brook	ORGANIZATION	- field was not the least illustrious member .

		It is worth noting , before going further , that his birth-year was
1809	DATE	, and that he of course knew
Edward FitzGerald	PERSON	, with whom he travelled in
France	LOCATION	in
1839	DATE	, besides being intimate with
Thackeray	PERSON	,
Spedding	PERSON	,
Arthur	PERSON	and
Harry Hal	PERSON	- lam ,
Lord Lyttelton	LOCATION	-LRB- at one time his pupil and long afterward his biographer -RRB- ,
Monckton Milnes	PERSON	, Trench ,
Maurice	PERSON	,
Venables	PERSON	, Frank Lush - ington ,
Charles Buller	PERSON	, the Tennysons , the Car - lyles , the Ashburtons , and numerous other not - ables of the early and middle Victorian era .

		Of the ' set ' with whom he and his beautiful wife consorted after his settlement as a
London	LOCATION	curate in the early forties , we read in the fifth chapter of ' Mrs.
Brookfield	PERSON	and her Circle , * now offered to the public in two attractive , well illustrated volumes : ` The record of their doings on any given day or week was then practically a history of every other one ; for the actions of the `` Set , '' as
Thackeray	PERSON	called a privileged few , became quite charmingly simple directly any members of it found themselves in the neighborhood of the others .

		A close , con - stant , pleasant intimacy would inevitably ensue and continue until the hour when some of them , forced away by sterner duties , were found to fly ' ' the festive scene . ''

		`` Festive '' describes almost ac - curately most of that wonderful companionship ; they had no wearyings whatever in one another 's society , they extemporized banquets , they strolled in and out of each other 's dwellings , they assem - bled the most brilliant of people on the shortest of notices ; they struck their wits together and al - ways emitted sparks ; they took keen and often critical interest in each other 's life and work , and when they parted set forth stimulated to other and finer achievements , which in many cases were in due time brought forth to the joy and enrichment of the world .

		THE DIAL 371 sonality .

		He is best remembered for his orator - ical , mimetic , and humorous powers .

		Kinglake , as quoted by our authors , said of him , ' As an orator of original genius , he possessed marvel - lous histrionic skill , which he was able to mod - erate in the pulpit ' ; and '' in the reading of Shakespeare he was never in his time surpassed by any one ' -- although his time included such Shakespearean readers as
Charles Kemble	PERSON	and his daughter Fanny .

		Of
Brookfield	LOCATION	as a hum - orist Dr.
Thompson	PERSON	, Master of
Trinity College	ORGANIZATION	,
Cambridge	LOCATION	, said that he had seen ' a whole audi - ence at one of these displays stretched upon their backs by inextinguishable laughter . '

		Concerning his family it will here suffice to say that he was the son of a
Sheffield	ORGANIZATION	solicitor of some note , and that ` he was one of a large family , most of whom possessed wit of a superior quality , though brought up in an atmosphere of Puritanism that was perhaps strict and rigid even for those days . '

		Mrs.
Brookfield	PERSON	-LRB-
Jane Octavia Elton	PERSON	-RRB- was the eighth and youngest daughter of
Charles Elton of Clevedon Court	ORGANIZATION	, afterward seventh bar - onet of that name .

		Her mother was one of * the beautiful Miss Smiths ' so often mentioned in the memoirs of the period , and she was herself noted for unusual comeliness and charm , as well as for her quick intelligence , her graceful wit , and her keen sense of humor .

		Her father 's sister
Julia	PERSON	was the wife of
Hallam	PERSON	the histor - ian , which of course made
Arthur	PERSON	and
Harry Hallam	PERSON	her cousins .

		And now , having suffi - ciently introduced our chief characters , let us permit them to speak for themselves , from the copious letters and journals of which the book is largely composed .

		Here is a characteristic passage from a love letter , written in
London	LOCATION	to ' dearest
Jane	PERSON	' under the paternal roof in
South	LOCATION	- ampton : ' I amuse myself with thinking how delightfully jealous you will be all this evening while I am dining with Mrs. D. , my old flirt !!!

		Yes -- I shall be there -- most likely sit next her -- say very , very pretty things to her .

		Seriously I think you will be rather uncomfortable !

		And thou shalt ^ now liotc sharper than a maggot 's tooth it is to have a faithless love !

		You know she is really very pretty and `` lights up '' like a lustre -- and has such winning ways !

		Ah ,
Jenny	PERSON	, sweet child -- they must have loveliness indeed to win the eye even from your outward and poorest loveliness -- and winning ways they must possess that could charm one 's heart into forgetting your fond confiding affectionate nature -- I never see any slightest ap - proach to you in head or heart ; and I feel it a sort of wrong to you to commend your beauty when praises so much more honorable are your due .

		I fear when my letters come to be printed in a breach of promise ease I shall be thought a great fool . '

		Like many another engaged couple , `` William and
Jane	PERSON	were forced to let the consummation of their happiness wait on the smiles of dame Fortune .

		Their love letters written during these pre-matrimonial years are in some respects un - usual , if not unique .

		On one side we find the queerest medley of fun and affection , humorous scolding and ardent devotion , paternal counsel and brotherly comradeship , familiarity -LRB- which ocasionally is most strangely permitted to border on coarseness -RRB- and the fantastic ebullitions of high spirits and a rollicking humor ; on the other , the ingenuous trust of an unspoiled child and the boundless love of a warm-hearted woman , the merry jests of a quick-witted girl and the tender anxiety of a young person solici - tous to form herself in all respects to please her lover .

		Varied and sometimes amusing are that lovers modes of addressing his sweetheart , as , ' my darling child , ' ' sweetest lady , ' ' my dear girl , ' ' dearest
Jenny	PERSON	, ' * sweet junk , ' ' my dearest Glum , ' ' dearest
Jane	PERSON	, ' and , after marriage , ' my dearest
Desdemona	ORGANIZATION	, ' ' my dearest person , ' '
Jean Octavia Eelton	PERSON	, ' ` young Miss , ' und dergleichen mehr .

		Breakfasts at
Eogers	ORGANIZATION	's , dinners at
Hallam	PERSON	's , and soirees innumerable elsewhere , brought the Brookfields into familiar relations with all the best
London	LOCATION	society of their time .

		Of the good stories told at
Eogers	ORGANIZATION	's table and at other hospitable boards , including their own , we find many quotable examples , as witness the follow - ing , whose immediate source is one of
Brook	LOCATION	- field 's letters : ` The new Bishop of
Xew Zealand	LOCATION	, in a farewell and pathetic interview with his mother , after his appointment , was thus addressed by her in such sequence as sobs and tears would permit : `` 1 sup - pose they will eat you , my dear -- I try to think otherwise , but I suppose they will .

		Well !

		-- we must leave it in the hands of Provideuce .

		But if thev do -- mind , my dear , and disagree with them . '' '

		Among other amusing amiabilities and whimsi - calities of this circle of friends was the playful habit they had of signing their letters with one another 's names , or with some fantastic pseudo - nym chosen on the spur of the moment , while a similar spirit of innocent foolery made them spell phonetically , head their notes ' St You and St Mee , ' address ifrs .

		Brookfield as the ' Coun - tess of St.
Luke	PERSON	's , ' or as ' the Eev .

		Mrs.
Brook	PERSON	- field . '

		Harr \ '
Hallam	PERSON	would sometimes closely copy
Thackeray	PERSON	's handwriting -LRB- they called him ' Thack ' -RRB- and then apologize for ' this base im - itation of the Great Humourist . '

		In a frolicsome letter to his mother ,
Brookfield	LOCATION	excuses some absurd spelling by explaining , ' I 've got such a c-old id by dose I caddot write the letters eb ad ed / But enough of these pranks -- or enough as soon as we have given the following scene , laid no matter where , time midnight and after .

		We copy from a letter to ` my dearest
Desdemona	ORGANIZATION	, ' the writer of it too apparent to need naming : 372 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, ` By about 12 most had gone .

		We had had
Meri	PERSON	- vale ,
Blakesley	LOCATION	,
Stanley	PERSON	-LRB- who wrote
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's life -RRB- ,
Signer Conaro	PERSON	of
Venice	LOCATION	,
Mansfield	LOCATION	, Gray , Frank iLuBhingtoD ,
Harry	LOCATION	, - Self , Veuables and others .

		Only five remained when I proposed reading part of a play , each one taking the part that came successively , reading in a ring -- so that , for in - stance , I began -- next party that spoke would be Harry -- next
Lushington	LOCATION	, & c. , straight away round and round so that one man in his time played many parts .

		The absurdity of this 1 can not describe -- we laughted into fits -- but the re - markable thing is the gravity of these youngsters when there is need of it .

		Thus Harry would be reading Polonius ,
Laertes	LOCATION	, or Ophelia with the most shameless attempts at propriety , while we were all splitting around -- and he was equally con - vulsed when others than himself were reading .

		At length we were obliged to give it up .

		At 3 we retired . '

		Turning now from such frivolity , let us take a peep at
Brookfield	LOCATION	dining with the
Carlyles	ORGANIZATION	on
Christmas day of 1852	DATE	, Mrs.
Brookfield	PERSON	being in attendance on her sick father .

		From the hus - band 's diary we clip the following fragment : '
Carlyle	PERSON	now and then put a bit of what he thought one ought to like -- of leg , of loin , or of fat , on one 's plate with a sort of genial , homely hospitality which was touching .

		There was won - derful nut-brown from the neighbouring * '
Crick	PERSON	- eters , '' Port and
Sherry	PERSON	, to which Madam presently added a bottle of excellent
Madeira	LOCATION	.

		Meanwhile , the talk was incessant but remarkable for nothing but cheeriness .

		Then came woodcocks , and finally a Christmas plum pudding with brandy sauce -- which brought on my story of the Saddleworth elector at York in
Montague Wilson	LOCATION	's contest about 25 years ago .

		At one of the open Taverns he called to the waiter : `` Waiter !

		ha ' ye nowt better nor woin ? ''

		`` No , sir , nothing better than champagne , port , sherry , whisky , gin , brandy , etc. '' `` Way then !

		bring us a quart of that stuff we hed we ' t puddin . ''

		Carlyle laughed like a vol - cano at this -- and twisted it many ways in the course of the
evening	TIME	.

		After dinner and wine C. and I adjourned upstairs for a pipe of York Kiver Tobacco -- over which he talked characteris - tically , chiefly about Education .

		Then downstairs to cheerful tea -- and so made end at ten o ` clock , and I went home in an omnibus with the silent cousin who had dined with us , bearing with me half a dozen old pipes of C. 's , and the one he had used that evening for a memorial of a day that I felt very grateful for and not a little elated by . '

		And now a long leap to the end of the book and the death of
Brookfield	LOCATION	at the early age of sixty-five -- not sixty-three , as the types have put it .

		His last words were to his wife , ' Good-bye , dear
Jane	PERSON	, and God bless you ! '

		Beyond being made honorary chaplain , and later chaplain-in - ordinary , to the Queen , and inspector of schools , a post which he held for seventeen years , he had enjoyed little official recognition of his talents .

		In literature he lives to us , in a modest way , as the Eev .

		Frank Whitestock in
Thackeray	PERSON	's sketch , ' The Curate 's Walk , ' and also in his friend
Lyttelton	LOCATION	's brief memoir of him , in which are printed eulogistic letters from illustrious friends and a sonnet by
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mrs.
Brook	PERSON	- field survived her husband by twenty years . '

		Had she been inclined to change her state and move in a higher and more exclusive sphere , ' write her biographers , ' she had several oppor - tunities for re-marrying , but her love for her children made her consider them , and she con - cluded to devote the rest of her life to them .

		She did not as a widow remain in retirement , ' but continued to enliven the company of her old friends , and graciously welcomed the new , ' always surprised and pleased that she was still sought out and noticed . '

		Some of
Thackeray	PERSON	's letters to , Mrs.
Brookfield	LOCATION	are already familiar from having appeared both in a prominent magazine and afterward in book form .

		She is said to have been the original of Lady Castle - wood in '
Henry Esmond	PERSON	. '

		Her own novels , ' Only George , ' ' Influence , ' and ' Not a Heroine , ' will be remembered by some readers ; and those who knew her in life will recall her rare gift as a viva voce story-teller , as well as her refined , dignified and delicately sympathetic bearing toward all classes , even the humblest .

		The many portraits in this work deserve es - pecial mention , some because they are unfamil - iar , others because they are admirably engraved , and still others for both reasons .

		The fourteen - page index , too , is useful .

		And so we close the volumes , feeling that it is well to have been ad - mitted , even for a few hours , to the bright and joyous company of a merry-hearted husband and wife and their brilliant circle of high-souled ^ '' ^ '' ^ • ^ -

1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAJL 373 counts his gifts complete without some new tale of outdoor life .

		This year there is satisfac - tion for all who love such stories -- and in this count we all enroll ourselves as children ; for each of the best-known writers in this field has given us a new book as good as his best , and several new writers have brought their offerings .

		Among these books none vrill be more justiy popular than Mr.
Thompson Seton	PERSON	's ' Animsd Heroes . ' '

		A hero is an individual of unusual gifts and achievements .

		Whether it be man or animal this definition applies . '

		And
Carlyle	PERSON	himself would scarcely deny a meed of hero - worship to the eight * individuals ' whom the book celebrates .

		The fact that most of them belong to the common tribes rather enhances the appreciation of their qualities .

		Even the Slum Cat , it seems , is worthy to enter the class of animals Mr.
Seton	PERSON	has known , and though her heroism may not have exactly the same fibre as that of the Sandhill Stag , it is nevertheless genuine and admirable .

		The author 's power has increased as his style has become more sim - ple and his allegiance to plain facts more indis - putable .

		He has never told a story more dra - matically than that of Little War-horse , the
Jack Babbit	PERSON	, or more touchingly than that of
Arnaux	LOCATION	, the
Homing Pigeon	ORGANIZATION	.

		As if to prove , too .

		that his greater command of the common - place has not lessened the wealth of his imagin - ation , he closes his volume with the ` Legend of the White Reindeer , ' a haunting storv in which plain fact runs off confessedlv and most alluringly into pure fancy .

		With regard to the illustrations , one might suggest that here and there they are too sketchy and uncertain to add either the humor or the ' illumination that the author intends .

		But this suggestion is only a marginal note .

		In Mr.
Long	PERSON	's * Xorthem Trails ' the stories are less tense and dramatic , partly because the author is so sensitive to the world in which the dumb creatures move -- ' his soul , like a wind - touched harp , thrilling to the melodv of woods and waters ' -- that he never quite detaches his drama from the background .

		For this reason his stories have a charm and an excellence of their own .

		There is a peculiar fascination about these northern trails , not only because in fol - lowing them one finds himself ` face to face with new animals -- white wolf , fishes , salmon , wild goose , polar bear , and a score of others big and little ' -- but because the far-north country which they traverse , ` the land of space and silence , ' has an unfamiliar and mysterious beauty .

		The consciousness of this beauty is in each of these new stories , softening and human - izing the effect of them .

		Yet the stories are well told for their own sake , too , and most of their details stand clearlv in the reader 's mem - or -RCB- - .

		If choice were to be made where each is good , perhaps the preference would fall upon ' The Quest of Waptonk , ' the tale of a wild goose whose valiant defence of mate and gos - lings wins the intruder s whole-hearted admira - tion .

		In contrast to the collections of shorter stories , it is pleasant to come upon a well-developed biography such as Mr.
Eoberts	PERSON	has written of ' Eed Fox . '

		No fear that so eventful a life-his - tory will furnish any dull reading , even when told at length !

		This ruddy hero is possessed of unusual strength and cunning , though it must be admitted he has no more idea of honor among thieves than his less talented kinsmen .

		His ' calculations ' about avoiding traps , stalk - ing partridges , leading dogs over rotten bridges that will not hold them , and escaping detection by riding in a farmer 's wagon , may seem a trifle incredible .

		But he is a fine fellow , who deserves to come off victor in his struggle for life , and every child who reads about him will be glad that the story turns out well .

		A comparatively new writer , Mr.
Edwin C. Litsey	PERSON	, publishes several short stories , some of them reprinted from *
Leslie	PERSON	's Magazine , ' under the title ' The Eace of the Swift . '

		The stories have marked individuality , though the subjects of them -- a fox , a hawk , a coon , etc. , -- have been treated very often before .

		Each tale moves rapidly and firmly , with perfect adherence to the facts of animal life , and without sentimen - talit -RCB- ' .

		Mr.
Litsey	PERSON	does not care to blur over the cruelty and the tragedy of the wild , but brings most of its heroes relentlessly to their death .

		The very critical may think that in his method of narration he shows too much of the college theme-writer 's fondness for the ' sting in the end of the taU ' ; but the same critical spirit will appreciate to the full the keenness of his vision , the accuracy of his style , and the restraint which shows his power .

		More sumptuous in make-up and illustration than any of the books already mentioned is Mr.
Beebe	PERSON	's ` Two Bird-Lovers in
Mexico	LOCATION	. '

		As curator of omitholog -RCB- - in the
Xew York Zoolog	LOCATION	- ical Park , Mr.
Beebe	PERSON	has acquired a ' taste for birds ' such as few even of the professional bird - lovers possess , and his observations and his pic - tures will be of great value to the scientist , as well as a pleasure to the imtrained reader .

		Moreover Mr.
Beebe	PERSON	and his wife had seeing eyes for the land and its people , plants , and ani - mals .

		They give excellent proof of the fact that those who travel to see a particular thing see more , not only of that thing but of other things , than those who wander aimlessly .

		It is delight - ful to find a book which says little of the dust in the cities of
Mexico	LOCATION	, but much of the
Audu	PERSON	- bon warblers and Inca doves which flv about the 874 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, streets in place of English sparrows ; which instead of scolding at the dishonesty of the natives records their mercy in driving off the American plume-hunters who would have destroyed the entire species of egrets ; and which instead of expressing disgust at the myriad life which infests the ground and the air , chronicles the enjoyment the writers had in watching the lizards that crept about their camp , and in studying on moonliglit nights the shadows of flying-squirrels that made a ` chute ' of their tent-roof .

		Mrs.
Beebe	PERSON	's closing chapter on ' How We Did it ' contains practical advice about clothing and camp outfit which ought to tempt other travellers to follow her example .

		Mr.
Eraser	PERSON	's '
^ Sa	ORGANIZATION	' Zada Tales ' bring echoes from lands more remote than
Mexico	LOCATION	.

		The book is as unique and attractive in plan as in title .

		To forget the heat of
summer	DATE	evenings in the
Greater City	LOCATION	the animals of the Zoo meet for entertainment , each in turn inviting his friends to gather in front of his ' apartment ' and hear the story of his life .

		Sa '
Zada	PERSON	the keeper is always present , and has no difficulty in main - taining order .

		Each animal tells a characteristic tale showing the traits of his race and revealing his own peculiarities .

		The stories themselves are enjoyable , though nearly all , of necessity , reach their denouement in the capture of the narrator .

		On the way in which they are told perhaps in frankness two comments should be made , -- first that no one expects another ` Jungle Book ' will ever appear , and second that the dialogue is rather badly managed .

		Wild ani - mals , even though caged , would probably be impolite enough to interrupt each other in ' con - versation ; yet to represent them as doing so continually , spoils the telling of a story .

		But in spite of this fault the volume , which is large and beautifully illustrated , will be a treasure-trove to children who love animals and who love to hear them talk .

		For older readers who care less for the story - element , and more for the minute record which catches ` the harmonious rhythm of the great machine which we call
Nature	ORGANIZATION	, ' Mr.
E. Kay Eobinson	PERSON	's book of English out-door life will prove a special delight .

		` The Country Day by Day ' does for
England	LOCATION	, but more '' ^ elabo - rately , what Mr.
Bradford Torrey	PERSON	's ' The Clerk of the Woods ' has done for
America	LOCATION	.

		In deli - cate appreciation of everything that happens under the wide and starry sky the two writers are much alike .

		Eeaders trained on
Hawthorne	PERSON	and
Thoreau	PERSON	may think it strange that in mak - ing so careful a daily calendar Mr.
Kobinson	PERSON	does not give under each date his observations for a particular day , but chooses rather ` to fit the average day with its proj ^ er seasonal event . '

		But there is no carping at the fulness and accuracy with which this method is car - ried out , each day chronicling some event different from every other .

		Whoever wishes to prepare his eyes to see the birds and beasts , iu sects and flowers of
England	LOCATION	, and the subtle changes which cross the face of that country from season to season -- even to the changing tints of ' the pale thrift , which in earlier
Summer	DATE	spreads a pink film over the sea - wastes ' -- will cherish Mr.
Eobinson	PERSON	's book with gratitude .

		Wholly different in character from any of these books , and in some ways more signif - icant than any of them , is Mr.
John Bur	PERSON	- roughs 's `
Ways of Nature	ORGANIZATION	. '

		Having in mind the controversy between those who believe that animals reason and those who do not , Mr.
Bur	PERSON	- roughs has set himself to give a comprehensive statement of his o \ ^ 'n views .

		This he does with considerable clearness , and no apparent rancor or prejudice ; and what he says will command the permanent attention and respect of all na - ture-lovers .

		Briefly , Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	thinks that animals seldom , if ever , reason .

		He says : ` It is 38 plain as anything can be that the ani - mals share our emotional nature in vastly greater measure than they do our intellectual or our moral nature ; and because they do this , because they show fear , love , joy , anger , sympathy , jealousy , because they suffer and are glad , because they form friendships and local attachments and have the home and paternal instincts , in short , because their lives run parallel to our own in so many particulars , we come , if we are not careful , to ascribe to them the whole human psychology .

		But it is equally plain that of what we mean by mind , intellect , they show only a trace now and then .

		.

		.

		Instinct , natural prompting , is the main mat - ter , after all .

		It makes up at least nine-tenths of the lives of all our wild neighbors . '

		To this belief Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	holds with a fair degree of consistency , working it out in many interesting details , and explaining away many apparent exceptions .

		His advice to the writers of animal stories he sums up thus tersely : ' Humanize your facts to the extent of making them interesting , if you have the art to do it , but leave the dog a dog , and the strad - dle bug a straddle bug . '

		It is interesting to notice how the boolcs on which we have been commenting arrange them - selves alx -RRB- ut the line which Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	lays down .

		On one side are those of Mr.
Long	PERSON	and Mr.
Eoberts	PERSON	, who believe that ' among the higher orders the greater part of an animal 's life is directed not by a blind instinct but by a very wide-awake intelligence ' ; somewhere nearer i \ \ Q liue , but still on the ' romancing ' side , are Mr.
Thompson Seton	PERSON	's stories ; and well on the other side are those of the other writers , who quite plainly call ' a straddle bug a straddle bug . '

		Undoubtedly the controversy has been a good thing , calling for the confession on the part of
1905	DATE	.

		J THE DIAL 375 writers and readers alike that animal psychology is a practically unknown subject , and increasing the desire of both parties in the argument for greater knowledge and greater fidelity to truth .

		The Bise axd Fall of AVolset .

		* The
Life of Wolsey	ORGANIZATION	by
George Cavendish	PERSON	is a well-known book , and has interest for many readers .

		To the historian it gives a first-hand account of an important man .

		To the student of life and manners it gives a most curious picture of society .

		To the linguist it gives the English of a cultivated speaker at a time when such testimonials are not common .

		To the Shakespearean student it gives interesting com - parisons with ' Henry YIII . '

		and indeed other plays .

		To the student of English literature it offers the first regular biography in our tongue .

		It is a valuable book .

		As such it was wholly appropriate that it should be issued in beautiful form .

		There are other editions available to the student and those who must limit their book-bills , but there has been nothing really worthy the character of the book , relatively and intrinsically .

		We rather regret that the book could not have been edited in such a way as to bring out its literary and linguistic importance .

		Its vocabulary , for instance , is curious : it gives us an idea of the general use of words at the time that Sir
Thomas Elyot	PERSON	undertook to enrich the language .

		But such matters are not appropriate to such an edition as this .

		What is here proper is clear type , beautiful paper , and elegant binding , all of which we have .

		Also we very properly find here many very characteristic illustrations , some chosen from
Holbein	PERSON	's portraits of the notables of the period , and some from less known sources .

Cavendish	LOCATION	in a worthy dress : inside and out all is well done .

		Aside from it * attraction to the lover of beau - tiful books , however , or to the historian or the student of language , this book is most interest - ing .

		It is an account of a remarkable life at a remarkable time , but perhaps its intrinsic inter - est is as great as ami : hing else .

		Middle Ages and the
Kenaissance	LOCATION	, -- the rise and downfall of great men , the turn of For - tune 's wheel . '

		The wondrous mutability of vain honors , brittle assurance of abundance , the uncertainty of dignities , the scattering of feigned friends , and the fickle trust of worldly princes ' is easily perceived in this rise to great - ness , this gathering of riches ' by travail , study and pains , ' this elevation to dignity for twenty years , all to be cast down and destroyed in the shortness of a single twelvemonth .

		The dra - matic character of it all was what struck
Caven	PERSON	- dish , the enormous pomp and state of the
Cardi	PERSON	- nal 's household and the miserable nothingness to which it all vanished away in the days at
Esher	LOCATION	, where ' my lord and his family continued to the space of three or four weeks , without beds , sheets , table-cloths , cups , and dishes to eat our meat , or to lie in . '

		He does not , cer - tainly , deal with the matter with great art , nor with a very clear perception of the true char - acter of Wolsey or of the real reason for his fall .

		But he does , even in his simplicity , give a strong impression of the thing that had so much impressed him .

		It surely was a remark - able career and one to cause reflection .

		The rise and fall of
Wolsey	LOCATION	, -- the rise rapid , unscrupu - lous , and complete ; the fall sudden , unavoid - able , even mysterious , but absolute , -- the con - trast was to Cavendish everything .

		To this he subordinates all , not with art , as it would seem , but simply , as if forced to express the great idea that had so imposed itself on him .

		It is in this more essentially literary way , as a tragedy of life , that the work makes its strongest appeal .

		The old gentleman usher , revolving the fortunes of his former master to whom he was so utterly loyal , becomes almost a man of letters in his intense appreciation , and his direct simplicity has something of the qual - ity of fine literary art .

		376 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, shared with us their recollections of the days when all the world was young .

		During the past few years many such books , of varying excellence , have been greeted with an eagerness which proves that as a people our hearts are sound at the core , and that even the most worldly among us are open to an appeal from the remembered past .

		This list is now enlarged by the appearance of two clever books , ` When You Were a Boy ' by Mr.
Edwin L. Sabin	PERSON	, and ' Back Home ' by Mr.
Eugene Wood	PERSON	, both of which will probably outrival most of their predecessors in popular favor , since they treat of life from a boy 's standpoint , -- and a single boy is , as all the world knows , of more value than many girls , in books or out of them .

		Perhaps there may be things worth writing about in the lives of city children .

		It is hard to believe it , but it may be true .

		It is certain , however , that the years ' are all too short for the stirring events that crowd the hours of the for - tunate child who is born and bred in the coun - try , -- or , better yet , in a country town , in which there is enough of nature for council and companionship , and enough of man to gratify the social instinct and to call into being certain phases of life impossible alike on the farm and in the city .

		Both Mr.
Wood	PERSON	and Mr.
Sabin	PERSON	were evidently heirs to this golden birthright .

		Not else could they have so interpreted the joys of snowballing , coasting , swimming , the Circus , the County Fair , the Firemen 's tournament , school-days proper , the
Sunday	DATE	School with its picnics and Christmas trees , and all the innu - merable happenings of village life .

		Not else could they have pictured so vividly that great , honest , wholesome stratum of society which Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	loved as the plain people .

		Not else could they have discerned that in some boys are all boys , -- happy-go-lucky , care-free , idle , busy , mischief-loving , sound-hearted , as you can see -LRB- and hear -RRB- them a dozen times a day , if you , too , live in a country town and not too far from the school-house .

		The girls do not matter much , and the grown people only come in now and then .

		In the text of these volumes , and in the excellent drawings of Mr.
Frost	PERSON	and Mr.
Steele	PERSON	, the boy 's the thing .

		Here is a bit from ' Back Home ' which will give a taste of its quality : ` We still had some good kind of a time , but nothing like the good times they had out at the school near grandpap 's , where I sometimes visited .

		There you could whisper !

		Yes , sir , you could whis - per .

		So long as you didn ' t talk out loud it was all right .

		And there was no rising at the tap of the bell , forming in line , and walking in lock-step .

		Seemingly it never entered the school boards ' heads that anybody would ever be sent to state 's prison .

		They left the scholars unprepared for any such career .

		They have remedied all that in city schools .

		Now , when a boy grows up and goes to Sing Sing he knows exactly what to do , and how to behave .

		It all comes back to him , ' And thus writes Mr ,
Sabin	PERSON	of his dog : ` Thus the dog vanished from your daily life , and for weeks the house and yard seemed very strange without him .

		Then , gradually the feeling that you were to come upon him unexpectedly , around the corner , wore off .

		You grew reconciled .

		But to this day you are constantly encountering him in dream - land .

		He has n't changed , and in his sight appar - ently you have n't changed .

		You are once more boy and dog together .

		This leads you to hope and to trust -- indeed to believe -- that notwithstanding your mother 's gentle admonition , you will see him again , in fact as well as fancy , after all . '

		It seems a pity that both books contain so much slang , -- even so much quite modern slang .

		It is a pity , too , that Mr.
Wood	PERSON	, writing of the days of the
Bollo	PERSON	and Little Prudy books , should have introduced a man who wished to enlist in the Boer war , and a baby named Teddy -- ' He 's named after Theodore
Roose	PERSON	- velt , and they have the letter home , framed , and hanging over the organ . '

		The moral of these pleasant books is not for children , as morals are usually supposed to be , but for parents . '

		Back Home , ' they cry , to the simpler , truer , sweeter life , the saner pleasures , the purer air , that filled the whole world ' When You Were a Boy ' !

1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 37T Mr.
William Eleroy Curtis	PERSON	, the well-known newspaper correspondent , has many literary virtues that commend him to his readers .

		Sim - plicity , rapidity , vividness , and a certain positiveness , mark his writings , and have won for him a wide circle of daily readers .

		He has unusual faculties for observing the surface life of foreign lands , and the ability to mar - shal his data in good order .

		His two recent books entitled respectively '
Egypt	LOCATION	,
Burma	LOCATION	, and
Malaysia	LOCATION	' and '
Slodern India	PERSON	' are models of a reporter 's note-book in foreign lands .

		Both volumes contain pertinent and unbiased infor - mation about the politics , religions , education , industries , and society of the countries named .

		In the first named book , * Eg -RRB- ^ t ,
Burma	LOCATION	, and
Malaysia	LOCATION	, ' the author conducts us over the usual routes and amid often described scenes .

		Port Said ,
Alexandria	LOCATION	,
Cairo	LOCATION	, ' ever new and novel to the oldest traveler , ' the Pyramids , the Sphinx , and the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	, are of course the main points of interest in
Egypt	LOCATION	.

		To add anything new to these old familiars would be impos - sible ; but Mr.
Curtis	PERSON	's view-point is at times refreshing .

		It is out of the common run of description to read that the famous ideal of mystery in stone has ' no more expression than there would be in any sandstone image that has been hit square on the nose by a three hundred pound shot fired from a French cannon and had its features scattered over a square mile of desert . '

		The
Nile	ORGANIZATION	, always the most interesting of rivers , is to extend its in - fluence by means of the large dam at
Assuan	LOCATION	, which will create a reservoir a hundred and forty miles square , capable of storing several billion tons of water for use in the dry sea - son .

		Mr.
Curtis	PERSON	pays due attention and re - spect to the tombs and temples , the
Suez	ORGANIZATION	canal , Arabia and the Persian problem , the mission - ary problem , and to the redemption of the
Sudan	LOCATION	.


Egypt	LOCATION	's rapid advance in civilized ways is due , says Mr.
Curtis	PERSON	, to two causes : the noble work of the missionaries , and to
Lord Cromer	LOCATION	, the English resident and de facto ruler .

		To the English and to the Chinese in
Burma	LOCATION	also , the credit is given for driving out much of the darkness and for advancing the interests of that country .

		We hesitate to pronounce Mr.
Curtis	PERSON	's ' Mod - ern
India	LOCATION	' the best book of its kind , -- that is , a reporter 's note-book , -- but we can say unreservedly that it is a very helpful book for those who wish data upon which to base a reasonable judgment of the actual state of af - fairs in that country .

		The author lays the whole situation before the reader , -- the eco - nomic features , the famine question , the gov - ernment , the industrial development , climate , population , religion , and the natural resources ; all are explained graphically and concisely .

		Interspersed chapters give us pictures of a Hindu wedding ceremony , the motions of a vast
Mohammedan	DATE	audience at prayer at
Agra	LOCATION	, the
Taj Mahal	ORGANIZATION	, ` the most beautiful building in the world , which many have sprawled all over the dictionary without conveying the faintest idea of its glories and loveliness , ' the gilded marble palaces of the Moguls at
Delhi	LOCATION	, and the holy city of
Benares	LOCATION	with its two thousand temples , its half a million idols , its beggars , priests , fakirs , ascetics , all living in ' one of the most interesting cities in the world , yet the most filthy , repulsive , and for - bidding . '

		Concerning Ix -RRB- rd
Curzon	PERSON	's admin - istration , Mr.
Curtis	PERSON	has only words of praise . '

		Lord
Curzon	PERSON	's rule has been a conspicuous and remarkable success .

		Although he has been severely criticised for his administrative pol - icy , and many of his ofiicial acts have been opposed and condemned , the sources from which the criticisms have come often corrobo - rate the wisdom and confirm the success of the acts complained of . '

		To catalogue all that Mr.
Curtis	PERSON	has written about
India	LOCATION	in this volume would require a column of print .

		There is much information , with statistics , about trade , the Hindu caste system , the
Mogul Empire	ORGANIZATION	, the mutiny , the number of per - sons killed annually by snakes , tigers , and other wild beasts , Indian railways , nautch girls , fakirs , thugs , Rajahs , Maharajahs ,
Nizams	ORGANIZATION	, the
Afghanistan	LOCATION	frontier question , the
Lhasa	LOCATION	mission , and a host of other things , major and minor .

		Mr.
Curtis	PERSON	's volume on
India	LOCATION	takes us ovei the main-travelled roads , but the book en - titled ` Eifle and Eomance in the Indian Jungle ' leads us into an entirely different sec - tion in that land of contrasts .

		The author .

		Captain
A. I. R. Glasfurd	PERSON	of the
Indian Army	ORGANIZATION	, spent nearly fourteen years in the ` jungly section , ' and now gives an account of his varied experiences in the paradise of big-game hunters .

		In his own words , ' These jungle sketches do not deal with what is perhaps the popular idea of Indian sport -- the imposing line of elephants , the gay party , the `` file-fir - ing '' of the battue , and piles of slain .

		They are merely the records of the quiet solitary shikari -LRB- hunter -RRB- who , lacking either the means or the inclination -- or both -- for the slaughtering of a large amount of game in a short space of time without the exercise of per - sonal effort of woodcraft , works alone , or in the company of a single comrade , and with his simple equipment penetrates to retired spots -- the peaceful haunts of game . '

		The chapter titles comprising the volume are sug - gestive of their enlivening contents .

		` The 378 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, Eiography of a Tiger / ' The Man-Eater of 3elkhera / ' A Night by a Jungle Pool / ' Eem - iniscences of Junglypur / call up visions of wild chases , hair-breadth escapes , the telling shot , and the glory of the chief end of the hunter -- to bag his game .

		Other chapters , such as ' Told by the Doctor / • ' The Vengeance of Jhapoo the Gond / and ' Round the
Camp Eire	LOCATION	, ' are for the time when the pipe draws well and memory says , ' That reminds me
/ Captain Glasfurd	ORGANIZATION	prides himself , we believe , on his own drawings in the book ; but they are not artistic , nor do they enhance the realism of the various scenes he sketches .

		Mr.
Caspar Whitney	PERSON	, editor of the ' Outing ' magazine , who won his laurels as a mighty hunter some years ago in the Far North , now adds to his fame by his recent travels in the
Ear East	LOCATION	, in
India	LOCATION	,
Sumatra	LOCATION	,
Malay	LOCATION	, and
Siam	LOCATION	.

		His volume bearing the title ` Jungle Trails and Jungle People ' is the record of a trip prompted by the lust of adventure , and by the desire to see strange lands and strange peoples , and to hunt strange animals .

		Mr.
Whitney	PERSON	has caught the trick of making a little human interest enhance the vivid story of some thril - ling or stirring hunting adventure .

		Che
Poh Lek	PERSON	, the
King	PERSON	's mahout , interests us almost as much as does the tale of the royal Siamese hunt for wild elephants ;
Phra Eam	PERSON	, who goes with the author for buffalo in the Siam-Bur - mese section , wins us as an example of
Ori	PERSON	- ental subtlety and of
Ear Eastern	ORGANIZATION	philosophy ;
Cheeta	LOCATION	,
Aboo Din	PERSON	,
Jin Abu	PERSON	,
Uda Prang	LOCATION	, all hunters or servants , enlighten us as to the mental and moral habits of the natives of the countries described .

		The too-often maligned Siamese finds a defender in Mr.
Whitney	PERSON	.

		Here is his picture , taken from the chapter entitled ` Through the Klawngs -LRB- canals -RRB- of
Siam	LOCATION	/ of the life of the Siamese : ` My travels have never brought me among a people seemingly more contented than these Siamese .

		Their wants are few and easily supplied : a single piece of stuff completes the scanty , inex - pensive costume ; rice and fruit and fish , to be had for almost nothing , constitute the food ; betel nuts , which high and low chew , may be gathered .

		Life moves very easily for them , and they go to their death with unbounded faith that
Buddha	ORGANIZATION	will take care of the next world , whatever it may be .

		Living , they hold to their simple faith as conscientiously as the Mohammedans , which is tantamount to say - ing more conscientiously than the Christian sects .

		Dying , they pass with confidence into the unknown ; and their bodies are burned and the ashes scat - tered to the four winds .

		Their attitude toward life is truly philosophic ; and friends left behind conduct themselves with equal sanity . '

		We should like to make many and long quo - tations from the book , telling about exciting affairs in the luxuriant jungle ; of how wild elephants are rounded up and driven into the kraal at
Ayuthia	LOCATION	, the old Siamese capitol ; of the trotting ' rhino ' of
Kelantan	LOCATION	; of boar - hunting in
Malay	LOCATION	; and of a wonderfully nerve - racking experience with a tiger .

		But our space forbids .

		It is sufiicient to say that Mr.
Whitney	PERSON	has written a volume of travel and adventure that will make his name conspicu - ous among American hunters .

		The volume entitled ' Far Eastern Impres - sions , ' by Mr.
Ernest F. G. Hatch	PERSON	,
M.P.	LOCATION	, is a straightforward account of a business trip in
Japan	LOCATION	,
Korea	LOCATION	, and
China	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Hatch	PERSON	made his tour three years ago , and ' took pains to collect and note down many facts and opinions bearing on the Far Eastern problem , and particularly upon its commercial aspects . '

		His impressions , which are weighty enough to bear a stronger word , relate chiefly to politics , concessions , commercial prospects , and railway develop - ment , particularly in
China	LOCATION	.

		The chief note concerning
Japan	LOCATION	points out that that country is rigidly Protectionist , in view of which fact she will be likely to seek to create new and ex - clusive markets for herself in the sphere of her conquests , and to take all for her own by im - posing an exceedingly onerous tariff .

		Of the Chinese as allies of the British , the author , after complimenting the British diplomats on their British honesty and straightforwardness , says : ' Deep down in the heart of the
China	LOCATION	- man there is an abiding faith in our country -LSB-
England	LOCATION	-RSB- .

		He believes in our disinterested - ness and our genuine desire to help
China	LOCATION	.

		He trusts us as he trusts no other outsider . '

		Much attention is given to railway concessions in
China	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Hatch	PERSON	regards the concessions given by the Chinese government to various countries for building railroads as indicating very closely the ambition of the international giants .


Russia	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	, and
America	LOCATION	lead in these concessions ; and if Mr.
Hatch	PERSON	's opinion be correct , the first four are tending to monopolize the concessions , to the detriment of
England	LOCATION	's commercial and political power .

		On the other hand , British diplomacy is evidently working to establish a great line of railway from
Shanghai	LOCATION	to
Chen Tu	ORGANIZATION	, a line that will ultimately be a bond of communication between
China	LOCATION	and the
Indian Empire	ORGANIZATION	.

		An excellent map showing these rail - way concessions forms the frontispiece to the book .

		If the much discussed break-up of
China	LOCATION	ever occurs , Mr.
Hatch	PERSON	thinks that
Japan	LOCATION	will take the lion 's share of the spoils ; while Eng - land , if she pursues her present policy , will be a good second in the game .

		Mr.
Hatch	PERSON	's impressions are not mere chance gatherings and ill-digested glimpses ; they are acute and weighty observations upon the things that ap -
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 379 peal to a business man interested in polities .

		The volume is well indexed , well illustrated , and written in a clear and forcible style .

		In striking contrast to the thorough discus - sion of Far Eastern questions in the work just noticed is the volume entitled ^ John
China	LOCATION	- man at Home / by the
Eeverend E. J. Hardy	PERSON	, who for over three years was Chaplain to His Majesty 's Forces at
Hong Kong	LOCATION	.

		To vary Moth 's comment to
Costard	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	has been at a ieast of sights and stolen the scraps .

		His vol - ume is a very medley of things Chinese , -- Chi - nese cities with their local peculiarities ;
Chi	PERSON	- nese food , medicine , clothes , houses and gar - dens , servants and laborers ; customs of mar - riage , burial , and mourning ; Chinese boys , wx -RRB- men , and girls , their manners , education , punishments ; religions , superstitions , spirits , monks and priests , foreign missionaries .

		New Year devotions and rites , government , -- and much more .

		One is tempted to use the simile of a bushel of chaff , with all these items ; but such a comparison would convey a wrong im - pression of the book .

		Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	takes his task seriously , and does not hold Chinese charac - teristics up to ridicule .

		There may be , indeed , an overplus of small knowledge about the oddi - ties and curiosities in this land of topsy-tur - veydom .

		but such knowledge is often indicative of the basic life of a people .

		Certainly Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	can hardly be accused of levity when he makes the following comparison between
John Chinaman	PERSON	and John Bull : ' Englishmen and Chinamen should be good friends , for they have much in common .

		Both have a great capacity for making , saving , and `` njoying money .

		Both are enterprising in com - merce , and both will stick to their bargains .

		Both build substantial buildings , as , for instance , bridges , and both take a pride in good work .

		The ■ Chinese are not less characterized by common - sense than Englishmen , and they have
John Bull	PERSON	's solidity , respect for law , and conservatism .

		Neither John JBull nor
John Chinaman	PERSON	allow sentiment to interfere with business , and there is nothing they ■ value more than a good dinner . '

		For one who contemplates a hurried journey through the lands of the ' Son of Heaven , ' Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	's book will be a most acceptable eye - opener to Chinese characteristics .


Sidney Smith	PERSON	once begged Lord
John Kussell	PERSON	to ' write a History of Louis XI Y. , and put the world right about that old Beast . '

		To apply such a generic term as this latter to the Empress Dowager of
China	LOCATION	would be neither polite nor politic were it not a fact that less charitable and more specific epithets have been applied to `` her .

		As a matter of fact the world knows little or nothing of the personal life of the
Empress	ORGANIZATION	, and will likely know but little more .

		Miss
Katharine A. Carl	PERSON	, through the influence of Mrs.
Conger	PERSON	, wife of the United States Minister , was called to the Chinese court to paint the Dowagers portrait , and for eleven months she dwelt in a palace next to the throne room .

		Moreover , she was , so she says , * the first for - eigner to be domiciled in any residence of a Son of Heaven since the time of
Marco Polo	PERSON	, and the only foreigner who had ever been within the Ladies ' Precincts . '

		Much would naturally be expected from such a golden oppor - tunity , but we must say that Miss
Carl	PERSON	in her book called ' With the Empress Dowager ' has not fulfilled the promise of her title .

		There is much entertaining tittle-tattle in the volume about Chinese court life , but Her Majesty is lost in the distent perspective .

		Here is Miss
Carl	PERSON	's description of the
Empress	ORGANIZATION	, probably the first accurate pen picture of the woman : ' A perfectly proportioned figure , with head well set upon her shoulders and a fine presence ; really beautiful hands , daintily small and high bred in shape ; a symmetrical , well formed head , with a good development above the rather large ears ; jet black hair , smoothly parted over a fine , broad brow ; delicate , well-arched eyebrows ; brilliant , black eyes , set perfectly straight in the head ; a high nose , of the type the Chinese call '' noble , '' broad between the eyes and on a line with the forehead ; an upper lip of great firmness , a rather large but beautiful mouth with mobile , red lips , which , when parted over her firm white teeth , gave her smile a rare charm ; a strong chin , but not of exaggerated firm - ness , and with no marks of obstinacy .

		Had I not known that she was nearing her sixty-ninth year , I should have thought her a well preserved woman of forty .

		Being a widow she used no cosmetics .

		Her face had the natural glow of health , and one could see that exquisite care and attention were bestowed upon everything concerning her toilet .

		Personal neatness and an excellent taste in the choice of becoming colors and ornaments enhanced this wonderfully youthful appearance , and a look of keen interest in her surroundings and remark - able intelligence crowned all these physical quali - ties and made an unusually attractive personality . '

		Such a description conveys little idea of a woman with the ' soul of a tiger ' or other beastly attributes by which the
Empress	ORGANIZATION	has heretofore been described .

		The volume is attractive in physical make-up , and enlivened with pictures of an unusual kind .

		With an avant-propos by
Youssef Zia Pacha El Khalidy	PERSON	, ex-mayor of
Jerusalem	LOCATION	, a preface by
Prince de Polignac	ORGANIZATION	, Colonel of the
French Army	ORGANIZATION	in
Algiers	LOCATION	, and an introduction which is a confession ,
Madame Hayacinthe Loyson	PERSON	, an American-born woman , and wife of the vener - able Father Hayacinthe of
Paris	LOCATION	, publishes a book with the oracular title ` To Jerusalem Through the Lands of Islam . '

		We call the title oracular , because it partly reveals and partly conceals the contents of the volume .

		As a book of travels , it recounts the journey of
Madame Loyson	PERSON	and her husband in
Xorth Africa	LOCATION	and
Palestine	LOCATION	.

		But the ulterior pur - pose of the Loysons was not to see these coun - 880 THE DIAL .

		-LSB- Dee .

		1 , tries with the outer eye ; it was rather to view them with the inner eye of the spirit .

		It was a ' tour of Christian exploration ' for the purpose of reconciling all believers in the same God , -- and particularly among '
Mussel	PERSON	- mans and Christians . '

		Everywhere in the book there is the intense spiritual earnestness of a good woman holding conferences with the leading representatives of Islam .

		As our in - terest in the book is largely personal , we take the following excerpt to reveal the character of the author .

		She has been in the desert preaching to the whole world , and at night re - quests to be left alone .

		Her emotions are described as follows : ` As the sun 's great disk dropped slowly through the golden atmosphere and touched the horizon , I was seized with an indescribable but ecstatic awe which made me tremble in every limb .

		The stars burst forth in such suddenness and splen - dor that it already seemed midnight !

		And now as I mounted a huge wave of sand , the evening breeze which rises from off the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	at sunset came to me in such grateful suggestion that I felt the beating wings of those very angels who bore my glorious Patron , Saint
Catherine	PERSON	of
Alexandria	LOCATION	, when she was broken and dead , across the desert and across the sea , up to
Mount Sinai	LOCATION	!

		So exalted was my soul , that my feet had long ceased to move , and I stood still , -- or rather I was upheld , for my own volition had vanished ; but the angels • -- her angels -- were keeping me company . '

		The most substantial and scientific book in our present list is the two-volume work bear - ing the title ' The
Jordan Valley	ORGANIZATION	and
Petra	PERSON	, ' by Dr.
William Libbey	PERSON	,
Professor of Physical Geography	ORGANIZATION	in
Princeton University	ORGANIZATION	, and Dr.
Franklin E. Hoskins	PERSON	of the
Syria Mission	LOCATION	at
Beirut	LOCATION	.

		Their trip , which was made less dif - ficult than such trips usually are in
Syria	LOCATION	and the Holy Land by a letter from the `` Waly of
Damascus	LOCATION	to the Mutaserrif of
Kerak	LOCATION	, asking him to take them down to
Petra	LOCATION	and bring them back again , was from
Joppa	LOCATION	by sea to
Sidon	LOCATION	and eastward to
Mount Lebanon	LOCATION	, then south to the Sea of
Galilee	LOCATION	, along the eastern side of the
Jordan Valley	LOCATION	to
Petra	LOCATION	, the valley of
Moses	LOCATION	, then back to the Dead Sea , and west of it to
Jerusalem	LOCATION	and
Joppa	LOCATION	, Such a journey leads one ' into regions of country and of history that are far from the beaten line of the ordinary traveller . '

		The book , which con - tains a unique series of photographs , gives a vivid and picturesque account of the present condition of the country through which the children of Islam passed from their bondage in
Egypt	LOCATION	to the Promised Land .

		From much material in the volumes that is profitable and interesting , we shall confine ourselves to a consideration of three points : the
Jordan	PERSON	river , the mosaic map at
Madeba	LOCATION	in
Moab	LOCATION	, and to
Pharoah	LOCATION	's
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	at
Petra	LOCATION	.

		Concerning the meandering of the
Jordan	PERSON	, Dr.
Libbey	PERSON	offers the explanation that the river , after reaching a point below the sea level , finds its bed rising , and that this rising to the south would account for the serpentine course of the stream .

		Commenting further on this peculiar - ity of the sacred river , he says : ` Perhaps the strangest thing about this famous river is that none of the ancients ever guessed at this curious feature of the stream .

		They journeyed up and down the
Jordan Valley	LOCATION	since before the days of Abraham ; they climbed down the roads from
Jerusalem	LOCATION	to
Jericho	LOCATION	and up into
Moab	LOCATION	and
Edom	LOCATION	; they built roads east and west of the Jor - dan , joining the seacoast and the desert , cutting the
Jordan Valley	ORGANIZATION	at many points and angles ; they built roads and bridges and cities at levels far below the surface of the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	, and yet never seem to have suspected that this stream dif - fered from most of the rivers of the globe in this respect , Greeks ,
Eomans	LOCATION	, and Mohammedans , Jews , Christians , and Crusaders knew every nook and cranny of its winding course , but failed to realize that while its head and source rested high on noble
Hermon	ORGANIZATION	's side , its mouth in the
Dead Sea	LOCATION	, unlike most other river endings , was far below the sur - face of the habitable world and all the surrounding oceans . '

		Next to the discovery of the famous Moabite stone .

		Dr.
Libbey	PERSON	considers the discovery of the remains of an ancient mosaic map at
Madeba	LOCATION	as the most important archaeological ' find ' beyond the
Jordan	PERSON	.

		The map , which probably dates from the
fifth century	DATE	, is drawn from east to west , and is possibly a geographi - cal picture of the land which Moses looked down upon from
Mount Pisgah	LOCATION	.

		The chief interest in the map is that it is likely to upset some old and cherished beliefs in Biblical geography .

		The authors spent five days in the city of
Petra	LOCATION	, ' a rose-red city half as old as
Time	ORGANIZATION	, ' where only twenty-five Europeans have entered during a hundred years , and near - ly all of whom entered by stealth , and more than half were driven out after a hurried glance at the wonders and mysteries of the place .

		Not more than three or four were al - lowed to spend a night within the ruins , but our two authors remained five days and floated the American flag unmolested within the an - cient city .

		The entrance to this ' strangest city on our planet , ' and the first view of * Phar - aoh 's
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	' , are described as follows : ` Seen at morning , at
midday	TIME	, or at
midnight	TIME	, the Sik , this matchless entrance to a hidden city is unquestionably one of the great glories of ancient
Petra	LOCATION	, We wandered on , amazed , enchanted , and delighted , not wishing for , not expecting anything that could be finer than this , when a look ahead warned us that we were approaching some monu - ment worth attention , and suddenly we stepped out of the naiTow gorge into the sunlight again .

		There in front of us , carved in the face of the cliff , half-revealed , half-concealed , in the growing shad - ows , was one of the largest , most perfect , and most beautiful monuments of antiquity , -- Pharaoh 's
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	! '

		1005 -RSB- THE DIAL 381 We have taken more space than usual in outlining this work , but have fallen short of conveying an adequate estimate of its many interesting , unique , and valuable features .

		The volumes are exceedingly well illustrated , and contain scientific data that are not generally accessible elsewhere .

		Holiday Pitblicatioxs .

		L One of the most sumptuous and elaborate of the year 's holiday issues is ` The Gardens of
Italy	LOCATION	' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- , a two-volume crown folio , dedicated by special permission to the
King of Italy	ORGANIZATION	and containing brief descriptions of some forty splendid villa gardens , with over two hun - dred full-page illustrations .

		The book is pub - lished from the offices of the English periodical , ` Country Life , ' a fact which will vouch for the artistic excellence of the half-tones .

		These are made from photographs specially taken by Mr.
Charles Latham	PERSON	, whose very beautiful and dis - criminating work has appeared in former publica - tions from the ' Country Life ' press .

		The gardens of the villa
Albani	PERSON	occupy the place of honor in the fii-st volume and exemplify at once , for the uninitiated , the Italian connotation of the term .

		In extent , magnificence , and variety , in the almost complete absence of modern floral effects and the relatively small part played even by formal bed - ding , with the corresponding importance of sta - tuary and of architectural features done in stone and marble -- terrace stairways , pavilions , foun - tains , and facades , -- in all these respects the
Albani	PERSON	villa is a typical example of the great Italian garden .

		Such a garden can not be viewed apart from the villa of which it is an adjunct ; the pictures show clearly the unity of effect for which the old designers worked .

		They show , too , that a garden like the ` Great Cardinal 's ' possessed all the splendor and variety of a palace , and like a palace was planned to be lived in
day after day	DATE	, and to satisfy the varying moods of its owner , as well as the variant conditions imposed by changing houi 's and seasons .

		Accompanying the illustrations of each villa is a brief historical and descriptive sketch by Mrs.
Evelyn March Phillipps	PERSON	.

		`` Without being at all abstruse or ana - lytical , these essays serve to interpret the pictures by pointing out the distinctive features of each garden , and tell enough of the villa 's history to furnish the setting of human associations without which nothing in
Italy	LOCATION	is really significant .

		The reader is not allowed to forget the stately and mag - nificent past of the Medicis , the Borghese princes , and the immortal
Boccaccio	PERSON	, -- a past now turned to melancholy silence fraught with memories ; nor the ` frivolous , bygone summers , ' when gay lords and lovely ladies paced the shaded walks , talked of life and love in the sham-classic temples to
Diana	LOCATION	, and amused themselves with the sparkling fountains and tricksy water-works , which jetted unexpectedly and kept their victims prisoners un - til they could discover the secret
spring	DATE	.

		More than half the first volume is occupied with Roman villas ; in the second the Florentine gardens are equally prominent .

		There is no effort at chron - ological arrangement and no formal study of the development of Italian horticulture , but the read - er who is so inclined may find plenty of sugges - tions for such a study .

		For example , the pictures of the villa
Garzoni	PERSON	at CoUodi illustrate the be - ginning of the decadence of the art of gardening .

		There the ideal of the designer is boldness , sweep , and a grand coup d'oeil as the visitor enters , instead of the gradual revelation of one beautiful vista after another that was the peculiar charm of the gardens of an earlier day .

		There are pic - tured other gardens , which , departing entirely from Italian artificiality and primness , show English effects of park and wild-wood , and gar - dens whose modern owners have defied Italian conventions by growing masses of lilies , roses , and carnations .

		If one has seen the gardens of
Italy	LOCATION	he can not but enjoy and profit by a second visit under Mr.
Latham	PERSON	's able guidance .

		He who has never seen them will find the present treat - ment at once comprehensive and suggestive .

		The folios are neatly and durably bound in green linen .

		It is a pity that their sumptuous form necessarily puts them out of the reach of many purses .

		It is an interesting coincidence of the pub - lishing season which brings Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's ` Lon - don Films ' -LRB- Harper -RRB- and Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	's ` English Hours ' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- into juxtaposition on the reviewer 's table .

		The latter , to be sure , is only an illustrated reprint of essays belong - ing to Mr.
James	PERSON	's splendid prime , while the former is a collection of fresh impressions of
London	LOCATION	, based on a recent sojourn there ; but the contrast is none the less interesting and profitable .

		Readers of Mr.
James	PERSON	's recent novels , unless they belong to the small minority who have fallen uncritically under the spell of his vagaries of style , will turn with relief to Mr.
James	PERSON	at his best , exhibiting at once his keenest and most lucid analytical genius .

		The zest of living and of knowing life runs strongly on every page , despite Mr ,
James	PERSON	's re - cent revision of the essays .

		The motive of finding the interesting beneath the common - place , -- surely the artistic motive , -- is evei * - present .

		But whereas it has seemed to more than
Peter Bell	PERSON	that Mr.
James	PERSON	has recently been devoting himself to the dissection of some very faded and unpromising primroses , with the result that might easily be foreseen , -- these in - terpretations of English life carry the reader with them by their quality of tonic freshness , which takes the place of the bewildering curios - ity about everything and nothing characteristic of the late novels .

		All the essays have been printed before in one volume or another , most of them in ` Portraits and Places . '

		The excuse for the present reprint is therefore Mr.
Joseph Pennell	PERSON	's delightful drawings , which , in gen - erous number , punctuate the text .

		Besides be - ing good in itself , Mr.
Pennell	PERSON	's style suits Mr.
James	PERSON	's .

		An attractive cover and fine 382 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, workmanship make a volume which is mechan - ically worthy of its contents .

		-- Mr.
Ho	PERSON	wells him - self accommodatingly furnishes the apt simile for a comparison between ` English Hours ' and ` London Films . '

		The latter , he explains in a prefatory paragraph , are exactly films -- photo - graphic negatives taken by his mental kodak and developed for the possible pleasure of the kindly reader , ` who will surely , if he is the right sort of reader , be able to sharpen the blurred details , to soften the harsh lights , and blend the shadows in a subordination giving due relief to the best meaning of the print .

		.

		.

		If any one shall say that my little pic - tures are superficial , I shall not be able to gainsay him .

		I can only answer that most pictures represent the surface of things ; but at the same time I can fully share the disap - pointment of those who would prefer some such result as the employment of the
Roentgen	PERSON	rays would have given , if applied to certain aspects of the
London	LOCATION	world . '

		This leaves the critic quite without a case .

		Indeed it is only because Mr.
Howells	PERSON	is so wonderfully artistic and subtle a photographer , leaving so little necessity for a kindly reader 's indulgence , that one always wishes he would go lower than the surfaces of things , -- that his emotions were both more spontaneous and more significant .

		But it is late in the day to offer analysis of Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's genius .

		`
London	LOCATION	Films ' is bound uniformly with some other volumes of his es - says , and appropriately illustrated with very artistic photographs .

		Its ` films ' are far more interesting and significant than some that Mr.
Howells	PERSON	has shown ; they are indeed in his happiest analytic vein . '

		There is certainly something curiously complete in a journey through
Spain	LOCATION	and along the northeiTi coast of
Africa	LOCATION	; it inscribes a sort of semi-circle on the map , like an old cuneiform character mark - ing the inscription of splendid centuries . '

		So reads the final sentence of the final essay in that sumptuous publication , ` In the Track of the Moors ' -LRB- Dent-Dutton -RRB- .

		It can not be called a book of travel in the ordinary sense .

		The essays contain no personal reminiscence ; they are inter - pretative rather than descriptive , and they often run far afield into legend , history , politics , race characteristics and development , the inter-play of one race upon another , and other problems remote from the point of view of the guide-book , whether brief and unadorned , or sugar-coated with a liter - ary style and atmosphere .

		The size and weight of this book practically precludes its use as a trav - elling companion , and its method equally unfits it for hasty consultation after a day over-filled with sight-seeing .

		But it is rather as a luxurious and leisurely commentary upon travels past or to come , as a collection of delightful essays and beautiful pictures , that ` In the Track of the
Moors	ORGANIZATION	' should be judged and enjoyed .

		The book is the result of collaboration by
Sybil	PERSON	and
Augus	PERSON	- tine
Fitzgerald	PERSON	, the former furnishing the essays and the latter the pictures .

		There are sixty-three full-page illustrations excellently printed in color , embodying impressions of characteristic street and country scenes , of Moorish temples and gar - dens , of African mosques and market-places , or of Spanish and African types .

		Besides these pictures there are nearly as many smaller drawings in black-and-white set in the text , showing interest - ing bits of detail which the larger scope of the colored plates does not render distinctly .

		The larger plates are richly colored and replete with atmosphere and feeling , artistic rather than pho - tographic , and losing none of this quality by reproduction .

		They put their emphasis upon characteristic features in a Avay that satisfies the reader ; he can lay aside the book without the feeling he often has that the artist has chosen to illustrate all the things that no one cares to see .

		It is a pleasant surprise , too , to find that the es - says are not mere filling , added to give the book an appearance of weight .

		The essayist is equipped for her task by a thorough knowledge of the subject , a gift for analysis , and the ability to put the results of analysis into trenchant and finished form .

		There are frequent and apt quota - tions from French commentators , from the study of whom , perhaps , has been gained the exceedingly clear-cut point of view and the judicious and accurate phrasing .

		Another merit is the breadth of interest displayed ; the analysis of the Spanish stare is as careful and illuminating as the explan - ation of the French people 's various theories of colonization .

		It would be well if more of the splendid modern editions showed the discrimina - tion and real distinction of this beautiful volume .

		Special interest attaches to the tenth book of Mr.
Charles Dana Gibson	PERSON	's drawings , not only because it is the most representative collection he has yet given us , but because it is possibly the last .

		It is announced upon good authority that Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	has forsaken the -- to him -- highly remunerative art of black-and-white , because he feels that he has done the best work he is capable of in that medium , and that he will devote several years at least to foreign study , with the intention of working hereafter on a larger scale and in color .

		We shall miss the
Gibson	PERSON	cartoons .

		The present collection , issued by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons , is uniform in size , shape , and binding with the nine volumes that have preceded it .

		It is entitled ` Our Neigh - bors , ' a phrase generously interpreted to mean all sorts and conditions of men and women .

		The
Gibson Girl	ORGANIZATION	is charmingly portrayed , as well as the
Gibson Man	PERSON	, the
Gibson Dowager	PERSON	, and the
Gibson	PERSON	Old Gentleman , There are also the street types , which , though they are less characteristic ^ Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	has lately made his own .

		Such car - toons as ' The Babv of the Family , ' ' At the Horse Show , ' ` The New Hat , ' and ` To See the Art Editor , ' show the artist 's humor in its broadest and most representative aspects , and combine the best elements of both his earlier and later man - ners .

		Perhaps Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	has done his best in black-and-white ; at least he will have to do something very good indeed to surpass the gen - eral level of ` Our Neighbors . '

1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 383 Cartoons ' -LRB- McCIure ,
Phillips & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr.
John T. McCutcheon	PERSON	expresses the hope that the volume maj ' have a permanent interest because of the un - usual rapidity with - which history has been mak - ing in the last two or three years -- the period covered by the cartoons .

		As Mr.
McCutcheon	PERSON	puts it : * There has been a war that was a war .

		There have been disasters almost without parallel ; and we have weathered as pleasant a presidential cam - paign as the oldest inhabitant can remember .

		Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	.

		.

		and his activities in peace and in war and in sports have been a source of un - ending inspiration to the cartoonist .

		In addition , the nation has achieved merited glory because of the great exposition held in
St. Louis	LOCATION	, and last , but not least ,
Missouri	LOCATION	has taken it into her head to go Republican . '

		It is Mr.
McCutcheon	PERSON	's fa - mous cartoon on this last subject that gives a name to the collection , which includes over one hundred and fifty drawings .

		Besides those hav - ing to do with political subjects , there is the amusing series devoted to President
Roosevelt	PERSON	's vacation exDerienees , several groups of new * Boy in
Summer	DATE	' and ` Bird Centre ' cartoons , and that keen and delightful satire on sectional peculiari - ties and prejudices , pictured in the cartoons rep - resenting delegations from the various states of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	visiting the
St. Louis Fair	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Mc	PERSON	-
Cutcheon	PERSON	's work is unique in its understanding of our national life , and in the combined keen - ness and kindliness of its humor .

		The cartoons are well worth embodying in a form less tran - sient than the pages of a daily newspaper .

		` Drawings of
Rossetti	PERSON	' is this year 's addition to the ` Modem Master Draughtsmen ' series , the volumes of which are published in this country by Messrs.
Charles Seribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		This series , with the similar one called ` Drawings of the
Great ^ Masters	ORGANIZATION	, ' now comprises nearly a dozen titles , each an ideal study , both in text and illus - tration , of one distinctive phase of a great artist 's work .

		The introductory comment upon
Rossetti	PERSON	is written by Mr.
T. Martin Wood	PERSON	, and is a dis - criminating and illuminating piece of criticism .

		It calls attention to the intensely subjective and poetic nature of
Rossetti	PERSON	's art , a characteristic which makes it at once unsatisfactory and very instructive to consider his work purely in its ex - ternal aspect .

		The drawings alone , so Mr. `` Wood thinks , are proof that it was in
Rossetti	PERSON	's power to be the greatest imaginative illustrator of his century .

		` That he was not so .

		seems to prove that in this way , as in some others , he failed to attain to much that at first had seemed included in his destiny . '

		There is an interesting discus - sion of the proper critical attitude from which to approach
Rossetti	PERSON	's work , and the fifty drawings reproduced in the present volume are treated as illustrative material for various theses , thus re -
cei %	PERCENT	- ing considerable detailed attention .

		The re - productions are as distinguished among illustra - tions as is the preface among critical essays .

		Many are printed in tint and mounted upon rough paper of a harmonizing shade .

		They represent ■ all stages of work , from the rough sketch to the elaborate , highly-finished drawing that was so characteristic of one side of
Rossetti	PERSON	's genius .

		With the help of the suggestive introduction , any reader , however ignorant he may be of the aims and methods of the Pre-Raphaelite painters , may learn to understand and in some measure to ap - preciate
Rossetti	PERSON	's art .

		The experiences of
Noah	PERSON	and his ark have long been a favorite theme with humorists ; but they have never been more perfectlv set forth , than in ` The Story of
Noah	ORGANIZATION	's Ark ' -LRB-
Hough	PERSON	- ton -RRB- , as told and pictured by Mr.
E. Boyd Smith	PERSON	.

		The pictures are the feature of the book , but they would not be half so amusing without the sly and subtle himaor of the brief descriptions which accompany them .

		The build - ing of the ark , the assembling of the animals ^ and the adventures of the voyage are all made to yield their full measure of entertain - ment .

		The dinosaurs that had to be left be - hind because they were too big for the door , , the ` host of other strange beasts with long Latin names ' that refused to go in and were therefore ` doomed to be lost and become fos - sils , ' the other host that went in and , being tossed by the waves , regretted it , until the storm passed and they ` took a keen interest in the passenger list , to find their own names , as passengers always do , ' while poor Mrs.
Noah	PERSON	lamented , sajang ` the domestic arrangements are impossible , ' -- all these episodes are pictured with remarkable expressiveness and a clever but never too extravagant caricature .

		The plates are artistically reproduced in color , and the cover is as amusing as the rest of the book .

		A unique contribution to Omar literature , and one which will delight the hearts of all true Omarites , is the ` Life of Omar al-Khayy ami ^ written from the Persian point of view by Mr.
J. K. M. Shirazi	PERSON	, and imported by
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volume is bound in paper boards daintily decorated in colors with a Persian floral pattern , and has illram - nated headings , initials , and tail-pieces in a similar style .

		In a brief preface the author modestly explains that he does not enter the lists against European and American scholar - ship , but that he has endeavored to tell the life of Omar from the Persian standpoint , and to give an account of the tent-maker 's philos - ophy as it is understood by his many Persian admirers .

		In addition to the usual sources of information , he has had access to rare and in - teresting manuscripts of unquestionable au > - thpnticity , which belong to the
Royal House of Pei-sia	ORGANIZATION	and to Persian nobles and heads of religious houses .

		Many of these are regarded as objects of veneration , which it would be sacrilegious to submit to the view of an in ^ fidel .

		Naturally the conclusions drawn from these Persian sources differ a good deal from those generally accepted by Western students .

		Mr.
Shirazi	PERSON	's English style is clear and sim - ple , and his presentation of his points exceed - ingly interesting .

		His monograph , in its 384 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, dainty setting , will make a singularly appro - priate remembrance for the Omarites on one 's Christmas list .

		Mrs.
Fanny Y. Cory	PERSON	, whose delightful pic - tures of children are pleasantly and widely known , and Mr.
Burges Johnson	PERSON	, whose ` lit - tle boy ' verses reviewed elsewhere in this issue have interested the readers of the various Harper periodicals , have collaborated in the production of one of the most charming of the humorous holiday publications .

		` The Pleasant Tragedies of Childhood ' -LRB- Harper -RRB- are pictorially represented in over fifty full - page illustrations , each of which is accom - panied by an explanatory stanza in Mr.
John	PERSON	- son 's characteristically humorous style .

		From the
First Baby	ORGANIZATION	's first nocturnal fit of scream - ing , which its fond but inexperienced mamma fails to attribute to that simplest of causes -- a pin that pricks , to the three-year-old 's Christmas tragedy , which consists in seeing his cousin get the rocking-horse that
Santa Claus	LOCATION	had faithfully promised him , -- every picture and every verse is delightful .

		The small boy gets most attention , but little girls are not neglected .

		The
First Baby	ORGANIZATION	's patronizing patience with its inexperienced young parents , as expressed in the verses , makes a delicious contrast with the helpless , round-eyed , and generally tearful infant of the pictures .

		Later on the tragedies brought about by brotherly and sisterly affection are delineated in a knowing fashion that will appeal to any per - son who did not have the misfortune to be an only child .

		He who finds in his Christmas stocking a copy of
Sterne	PERSON	's ` Sentimental Journey ' in the new Riverside Press edition may well feel something more than gratitude .

		He may justly consider that a rare compliment has been paid him as a discriminating bibliophile ; for it is not everyone , not even every book-lover , that will be able to appreciate the real excellence of this reprint .

		Here are none of those showy surface features upon which most ` privately - printed ' volumes depend to win favor , -- no *
Morris	PERSON	' type , no garish decorations , no colored illustrations , no elaborate cover .

		But those who can justly estimate the beauty of graceful and legible type correctly set , of luminous and even presswork , of fine handmade paper , of fitting and durable binding , -- for such there is in every detail of this book a satisfying charm and dis - tinction .

		The volume is an octavo , similar in nearly all details to the edition of Fielding 's ` Voyage to
Lisbon	LOCATION	' brought out by the
River	LOCATION	- side Press three years ago .

		An appropriate lit - tle wood-cut vignette on the title-page is the only note of decoration in the book .

		Mr.
Yorick	PERSON	's narrative has been given many and various set - tings in its time , but never a worthier than this .

		Three hundred copies only are offered for sale by the publishers ,
Messrs. Houghton	LOCATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		This year , as heretofore , there comes from the press of
Messrs. Paul Elder & Co.	ORGANIZATION	an amusing col - lection of those humoi'ous and whimsical book - lets for which these
San Francisco	LOCATION	publishers are noted .

		This year 's output surpasses previous ones both in quality and quantity .

		It contains almost a dozen titles .

		` The Blue
Monday	DATE	Book , ' compiled and arranged by
Jennie Day Haines	PERSON	, is appropriately bound in blue , with a touch of gold to symbolize the cheering character of its con - tents .

		There is a page of quotations for each blue
Monday	DATE	in the year , and a blue
Monday	DATE	must be very deeply dyed to withstand the cheer - ful t-ne of these carefully chosen extracts from a varied assortment of authors , from Dr.
John	PERSON	- son and
George Herbert	PERSON	to President
Roosevelt	PERSON	and ` Mrs.
Wiggs	PERSON	. '

		-- ` The Matrimonial Primer ' by Mr.
V. B. Ames	PERSON	, with colored pictures and decorations by Mr.
Gordon Ross	PERSON	, is a little man - ual designed primarily for the instruction of the newly wed , but capable of furnishing a good deal of amusement to the world at large .

		It contains some clever satire , a good deal of wholesome hu - mor , and plenty of sound common-sense .

		The wit sometimes falls to commonplaceness but never to anything more objectionable .

		The primer is appropriately bound in gingham with a poster label , -- ` An Alphabet of History ' is a diverting collection of verses by Mr ,
W. D. Nesbit	PERSON	, with accompanying illustrations by Mr.
Ellsworth Young	PERSON	.

		Twenty-six historical personages , ranging from
Methuselah	LOCATION	to
William Kidd	PERSON	and from
Xan	PERSON	- tippe to Omar and
Samuel Pepys	PERSON	, are portrayed with accuracy , completeness , and much clever - ness .

		The ` Alphabet ' is printed on manila paper and bound in boards with a picture of Father Time on the cover , -- The familiar and ever - wel - come ` Cynic 's Calendar ' by
Ethel Watts Mum	PERSON	- ford ,
Oliver Herford	PERSON	, and
Addison Mizner	PERSON	re - appears once more in its gingham binding .

		This
1906	DATE	edition is better as a whole than any of its predecessors .

		The cream of the old ` twisted ' proverbs has been retained , and the new ones are equal to the best of the old .

		In general form and style of decoration the new calendar is simi - lar to editions of past years , -- ` The Joke Book Note Book , ' designed by
Ethel Watts Mum	PERSON	- ford , is intended as a pocket companion to take the place of that easily mislaid scrap of paper on which the man desirous of shining at his friends ' dinner-table is wont to jot down the point of some elusive good story .

		In order that any particular story may be forthcoming at the right moment , a method of classification is sup - plied by a few succinct and comprehensive head - ings , such as ` Irish , ' ` Ladies , ' ` Sports , ' ` Jingles , ' etc. .

		Under each heading is printed one good joke by way of a beginning .

		The headings and mar - gins are decorated , and the binding is attractive , so that the ` Joke Book Note Book ' is ornamental as well as useful , -- ` Sovereign Woman versus Mere Man ' is an attractive medley of quotations comparing or contrasting the sexes .

		They are brought together and arranged under appropriate headings by
Jennie Day Haines	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Gordon Ross	PERSON	furnishes a very attractive frontispiece , and there are symbolic sketches in black and white on the margins and in gold on the paper cover .

		-- ` Good Things and
Graces	PERSON	' is a collection of thirty decidedly original recipes by
Miss Isabel Goodhue	ORGANIZATION	.

		One of the three recipes for ` Greens ' will serve to suggest
Miss Goodhue	PERSON	's idea of a delectable menu .

		` Budding hopes ; shoots of new ideas ; sprigs of self-confi - dence ; tendrils of sentiment ; flowers of poetry .

		This makes an excellent combination , and is an especially good diet for all persons over forty-five years of age .

		If you do not find the necessary ingredients in your own garden , cultivate them .

		You will never regret it . '


Brown Betty	PERSON	, Poor Man 's Pudding , Mayonnaise for
Blue Monday Salad	ORGANIZATION	, and
Elixir of Youth	ORGANIZATION	are some of the other dainties which
Miss Goodhue	ORGANIZATION	teaches her readers to prepare .

		` Good Things and Graces ' is abso - lutely unique , and in both form and spirit it is a thorough - going holiday booklet .

		-- ' A Child 's Book of Abridged Wisdom , ' written by `
Childe Harold	PERSON	' and ' affectionatelj ' dedicated to the senior , ' is a series of irresistibly comic verses containing good advice for the young .

		Here is one quatrain : ` When near a row of corn , my dears , Take care what subjects you pursue .

		However harmless it appears , Remember that the corn has ears And may be listening to you . '

		The absurdity of the verses is enhanced by the illustrations in outline , which are quite as hu - morous as the text .

		Childe
Harold	PERSON	's wisdom is of a decidedly precocious order ; his touch is so light and his pims so good -- or so bad -- that his elders will appreciate him better than his con - temporaries .

		-- ` The Menehunes ' by
Emily Foster Day	ORGANIZATION	, with illustrations by Mr ,
Spencer Wright	PERSON	, is a booklet of rather different tjrpe from the fore - going .

		The Menehunes are the ` little people ' of the Hawaiian forests , and this is the story of their adventure with a fisherman whom they fought for the rule of the woods .

		Illustrations and bor - der designs are in keeping with the tropical at - mosphere and mjiihical character of the tale , and a unique binding of native cloth stamped with a barbaric pattern completes the quaint and original effect .

		-- Neither whimsical nor humorous , but in - tended like the rest of the Elder books to cater to th - - ^ ishes ot the holiday shopper in search of lit - tle books , is a dainty volume of lyrics by Mr.
Charles G. Blanden	PERSON	, entitled ' A Chorus of Leaves . '

		Nature and love are the themes of Mr.
Blanden	PERSON	's verse .

		It strikes no lofty note , but it is singularly graceful in rhythm and dainty in conceit , and makes no pretension to be more .

		The parchment binding , a frontispiece from a landscape by Mr.
William Keith	PERSON	, and generous margins give the little book a holiday air .

		Quite the prettiest among the less expensive holiday publications is the volume , published by Messrs.
Houghton	PERSON	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, containing
Bret Harte	PERSON	's poem ' Her Letter , ' with its two companion pieces , ' His Answer ' and ' Her Last Letter . '

		For the present reprint , these old favorites have been literally , as the title - page has it , ` pictured ' by Mr.
Arthur I. Kel	PERSON	- ler .

		There are specially designed end-papers , a decorated title-page in color , and head-pieces and tail-pieces in every available space .

		In short , every opportunity for decoration has been made the most of , and each smallest design is charming and entirely appropriate .

		The illus - trations , a few more in number than the stan - zas , are in color or in tint , some from wash - drawings and others from pen-and-ink sketches .

		They catch both the himior and the sentiment of the verses , and the artist has not forgotten that the life of Poverty Flat is now a full gen - eration behind us . '

		Her Letter ' is certainly one of the artistic triumphs of the season 's out - put .

		Two very beautiful holiday editions with Mr.
Howard Pyle	PERSON	's illustrations as the principal decorative feature have been issued by Messrs.
Harper	PERSON	and
Brothers	ORGANIZATION	.

		The more attractive of the two , if there is a choice , as well as the more fully illustrated , is ' The Line of Love , ' a series of seven stories of mediaeval romance by Mr.
James Branch Cabell	PERSON	.

		The tales have been culled from old French romans and dull English chronicles , and the mediaeval atmos - phere has been preserved by the quaintly , though never obscurely , archaic style of narra - tion .

		Ten pictures and a cover vignette by Mr.
Pyle	PERSON	, richly colored and conceived in a vividly imaginative style perfectly in keeping with the literary atmosphere , together with conventional floral borders in color , make a singularly at - tractive gift-book .

		-- A dainty violet cover , rather too ornate , suggestive page decorations , and four full-page illustrations in color , similar in style to those in the other volume , ornament ` The Island of Enchantment , ' Mr.
Justus Miles Forma	PERSON	n 's charming story of mediaeval
Venice	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Forman	PERSON	knows how to mingle love , war , and intrigue in a way to compel his reader 's interest , and he has never succeeded better than in this novelette , which is good enough fully to justify the pains that have been taken by the publishers for its embellishment .

		A novelty in garden-books seems almost im - possible , but it has been provided by
Blanche Elizabeth Wade	PERSON	, whose ` Garden in Pink ' is among the holiday publications of
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Twelve little photographs , daintily printed on thin paper and mounted on separate pages , show some of the beauties of the garden , while headings and occasional borders in color designed by
Lucy Fitch	PERSON	Per - kins ornament the pages .

		The ` Pink Garden ' was made over from an Italian garden , whose clipped yews made a quaint background for the novel color scheme .

		It was all pink even to the gardener , whose name was changed from plain
John Brown	PERSON	to
Giovanni Pincolini	PERSON	to match his new surroundings .

		And as the flow - ers that were unfortunate enough not to be pink must have attention , the rest of the gar - den space was named ` Vibgyor ' -- that is , the \ dolet - indigo - blue-green-yellow-orange-and-red - garden , -- and there was also the small ` Find - 386 THE
DIAX	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, Out ' garden , where things which might pos - sibly come up pink could be tried .

		All these gardens have their place in the story , as has the ` Garden Room ' for rainy days .

		The essen - tial human interest is furnished by the gar - dener , his wife , the two owners of the garden , and a
summer	DATE	guest known as ` the
Prevari	PERSON	- cator ' because she wrote stories , and belong - ing in the ` Pink Garden ' book because she is given to seeing gardens and other matters in a rose-colored light .

		` The Garden in Pink ' will fill all its readers with a desire for a pink garden , -- and next best to having one is to read about this one .

		A book that will be particularly welcome to those who are contemplating a visit to Lon - don 's art treasures , but one that has also plenty to offer the general reader , is ` The Art of the
National Gallery	ORGANIZATION	, ' a critical study of the paintings included in that great collec - tion , by Miss
Julia de Wolf Addison	PERSON	, author of several works of similar scope .

		A plan of the gallery , showing the location of the dif - ferent schools , follows the index .

		The pic - tures are discussed in the text as they are himg , -- that is , according to schools in their historic order ; but of course the limitation in space and particularly in number of illus - trations precludes this manual 's being a com - plete history of any school .

		It is rather a guide to the treasures of the gallery , almost every picture being at least briefly mentioned .

		Miss
Addison	PERSON	spent her early life in Eng - land , and is thoroughly familiar with her ground .

		Her method is descriptive rather than technically critical , -- which is decidedly the popular method .

		Nearly fifty illustrations in duo-gravure elucidate Miss
Addison	PERSON	's points , and together with a very handsome cover help to make an exceedingly attractive book .

		It is published in
Messrs. L. C. Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's series of guides to ` The Art Galleries of
Europe	LOCATION	. '

		` Two in
Italy	LOCATION	' is the name which
Maud Howe	PERSON	-LRB- Mrs.
John Elliott	PERSON	-RRB- gives to her new volume of Italian sketches .

		The other one of the ` two ' is of course Mr.
Elliott	PERSON	, whose draw - ings furnish material for half a dozen apposite illustrations .

		Mrs.
Elliott	PERSON	's Italian reminiscences are the fruit of an intimate acquaintance with the country and its people -- an acquaintance rendered profitable by a keen and humorous appreciation of any situation , however com - monplace it may appear on its surface .

		The chapters of her new book stand on that de - lightful middle ground between the short story and the expository sketch .

		They are not ham - pered by plot , but the human interest -- which is essentially the story interest -- is predom - inant , and the form is loosely narrative .

		Readers of `
Roma Beata	ORGANIZATION	' will enjoy this sec - ond volume , which , though of slightly different type , is equally permeated by Mrs.
Elliott	PERSON	's individual and entertaining point of view .

		-LRB- Little ,
Brown , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- ` Romance of the French Abbeys ' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is the fourth volume that Mrs.
Elizabeth W. Champney	PERSON	has given us , as the result of her researches in the fascinating field of French le - gend .

		The French chateaux , feudal , renaissance , and Bourbon , have been made to yield up their treasures of association ; and now the French abbeys prove to be equally abounding in tales of chivalrous gallantry and religious or patriotic fervor .

		Fifteen legends , sacred and secular , related in easy , narrative style , make up the new volume , which is bound uniformly with the others and liberally illustrated , in photo - gravure and half-tone , with pictures of the abbeys and their art-treasures .

		Some of the itineraries that Mrs. Champney found partic - ularly pleasant , among the abbeys of
Provence	LOCATION	^ Burgundy , Isle de
France	LOCATION	, and
Normandy	LOCATION	, are outlined in the last chapter ; but Mrs.
Champ	PERSON	- ney warns her readers that they must go quickly , for even the ruins of the abbeys are fast vanishing .

		We have come to expect an annual holiday vol - ume of Mr.
Paul Laurence Dunbar	PERSON	's negro melo - dies , and this year is no exception to the rule .

		The title-verse of the new collection is `
Howdy	ORGANIZATION	, Honey ,
Howdy	ORGANIZATION	. '

		The illustrations are from pho - tographs by
Leigh Richmond Miner	PERSON	, and the mar - ginal and cover decorations are by Mr.
Will Jen	PERSON	- kins , who makes a pretty setting , but a rather soberer one than those that Miss
Margaret Arm	PERSON	- strong has provided for several years past .

		The illustrations , on the other hand , are less glaringly realistic than usual , and the negro portraits and groups are pleasantly varied by a number of charming southern landscapes .

		Mr.
Dunbar	PERSON	's part in the volume needs no description , save to say that it is in his characteristic vein and well up to his usual standard in quality .

		-LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Another delightful collection of negro verse is ` Banjo Talks ' -LRB-
Bobbs-Merrill Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mrs.
Anne Virginia Culbertson	PERSON	.

		These lyrics , many of which have previously appeared in the magazines , are a real addition to our stock of negro melodies .

		Showing very little of the philosophical temper that makes Mr.
Dunbar	PERSON	's work unique , and being considerably less perfect in dialect , they have to their credit a decided imaginative quality , much picturesqueness of diction , and a charming spon - taneity of conception and treatment .

		A stanza from ` De Wood-Hants ' will serve as illustration : ` Wen de moon serouch down behime de hill An ' de dark fol ' roun ' you clost an ' still .

		Keep outer de wood , Ef you know w ` at 's good , Fer dey 's things in dar dat nuver show ` Twel de dark come on an ' de daylight go , An ' dey races an ' runs , an ' dey flars an ' flants , .

		An ' de name er dem creeturs is hants , chile ^ hantsl ' The illustrations are from photographs , which show considerable artistic skill in their avoidance 01 stilted posing and in the blurred softness which t ^ nes down the crudity that seems to be almost inseparable from negro portraiture .

		The cover is simple and of good design .

		Almost ten years ago and long before the ad - vent of Pastor
Wagner	PERSON	's ` Simple Life , ' President Eliot of
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	published a little book
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 387 called ` The Happy Life , ' a plea for much the same sort of plain IhTug and high thinking .

		This is now re-issued in a holiday edition -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , daintily bound in green and gold , printed with rubricated initials and headings , and having as frontispiece a photogravure portrait of the au - thor .

		` The Happy Life ' is intended to show young people in particular how to make the most of the blessings that are within the reach of aU , -- friends , books , the outdoor world , the power to think wisely and to serve one 's fellows .

		The points are concrete and practical , and the style is very simple , with a ring of nobility and sin - cerity about it that is worth more than many epigrams .

		-- From the same publishers and very similar in spirit is the 'Em erson Calendar ' com - piled by Mr.
Huntington Smith	PERSON	.

		Print and paper are attractive , and a fine portrait of the
Concord	LOCATION	sage serves as frontispiece .

		The preface claims for Emerson the honor of haAring been tha orig - inator , as well as the most inspired exponent , of the much discussed ` Simple Life ' ; and the quota - tions , one for each day in the year , are chosen to exemplify
Emerson	PERSON	's wide philosophy of life and the wisdom and poise with which he viewed its joys and obligations .

		This 'Em erson Calendar ' ought to give a happy holiday and a happy year to its recipient .

		An interesting and comprehensive , though distinctly popular , study of Biblical art has been made by Miss
Estelle M. HurU	PERSON	in her volume called ` The Bible Beautiful , ' published in a fully illustrated edition by
Messrs. L. C. Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The book aims to trace the de - velopment of Bible illustration from the crude pictures of the catacombs to the splendid art of the mediaeval mosaics , cathedral facades , stained glass windows , and mural frescoes , and finally to the modem work , mostly English , of the last two centuries .

		Three special in - dices are prorided : one of Artists , for the art student ; one of Places , for the tourist ; and one of Bible Subjects , for Bible students .

		The general explanation afforded by the text is supn plemented by three appendices which contain selections from mediaeval literature dealing with art origins .

		About fifty half-tones of various types of sacred art ornament and elucidate the text .

		The late Mr.
Paul Leicester	PERSON	Ford was partic - ularly apt at writing that type of short story which any young man , in search of a Christmas gift for the lady of his choice , instantly seizes upon as appropriate .

		This year the young gen - tleman will find his problem solved by a holi - day edition of * His Version of It , ' that pretty romance of by-gone days which old Reveille , the veteran of the stable , relates to his equine companions .

		Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish the book , with colored page borders , cleverly composed of romantic emblems , and half a dozen colored illustrations by Mr.
Henry Hutt	PERSON	.

		The publishers of the ` Thumb Nail Series ' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- display a really remarkable facility in choosing for reprint works that are suitable to the bibelot form and that will fit the varied tastes and needs of the Christmas shopper .

		Three new volumes for the current year are Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	's ` Sonnets from the Portuguese , ' with a few miscellaneous poems by both Mr. and Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	, and con - taining as an introduction the interesting essay by Mr.
Richard Watson Gilder	PERSON	recently pub - lished in the ` Century Magazine ' ; ` The Chimes , '
Charles Dickens	PERSON	's delightful gobliu story for the New Year ; and a volume con - taining five of ``
Washington	LOCATION	's greatest ad - dresses and letters , with
W. E. H. Lecky	PERSON	's sketch of ``
Washington	LOCATION	's character as an in - troduction .

		Mrs.
Blanche McManus Mansfield	PERSON	's cover designs , executed in embossed leather , are as original and suitable as the ` Thumb Xail ' covers always are .

		The
Browning	PERSON	and ``
Washington	LOCATION	volumes have portrait frontispieces , and ` The Chimes ' an illustrative one .

		A popular illustrated reprint of `
Ramona	PERSON	, ' with the pictures and decorative headings by Mr.
Henry Sandham	PERSON	that appeared in the two-volume edition of
several years ago	DATE	, has been issued by Messrs.
Little	PERSON	,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	, under the name of the `
Pasadena	LOCATION	' edition .

		It will be recalled that Mr.
Sandham	PERSON	accom - panied Mrs.
Jackson	PERSON	on her trip among the
California	LOCATION	Missions in search of material for `
Ramona	ORGANIZATION	, ' and that it was her plan to have him illustrate the book , which she always re - ferred to as ` ours . '

		His part , however , was not completed until seventeen years after the publication of the story .

		The `
Pasadena	LOCATION	' edi - tion is well printed and handsomely bound , being a popular but not in any sense a cheap edition .

		`
Her Memory Book	ORGANIZATION	, * designed by Miss
Helen Hayes	PERSON	and published by
Messrs. Harper & Broth	ORGANIZATION	- ers , is intended for a Oiristmas offering upon the shrine of the popular debutante .

		Daintily bound in violet and gold , decorated with lover 's knots , cupids , and roses , its blank pages await the rec - ords of my lady 's social triumphs from her debut to its natural sequel , her wedding .

		There is a page for her portrait , and others for samples of her favorite dresses and for newspaper clippings about her .

		There is space for entries about the sports she enjoys in each season , about her trav - els , and her particularly exciting shopping tours .

		Here she can preserve lists of the affairs given in her honor and of all the dozen varieties of di - version with which she fills her days and nights .

		The page headings and borders are so pretty and so clever that even a debutante without a taste for collecting memorabilia -- if such an one can be found -- will like to own and fill out this memory book .

		Eighteen years have elapsed since the publica - tion of Mrs.
Sarah K. Bolton	PERSON	's ` Famous Ameri - can Authors , ' and now the Messrs. CroweU offer the essays anew in a handsomely bound volume with two dozen illustrations portraying in fine half-tone reproductions the persons and the homes of six representatives of the old
New England	LOCATION	school .

		A great deal has been written about the lives of
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Hawthorne	LOCATION	,
Longfellow	LOCATION	, `` Whit - 388 THE DIAIj -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, tier ,
Lowell	LOCATION	, and
Holmes	PERSON	, but Mrs.
Bolton	PERSON	's nar - rative has nevertheless a decidedly attractive ring .

		She manages to tell the familiar facts in a genial , lively way , interlarding them with anec - dotes or personal impressions , and making her main theme in every case the essential quality of the author discussed .

		This reprint seems timely in the midst of the flood of writing that threatens to engulf our small output of really good litera - ture , and particularly in view of a recent tend - ency to underrate the
New England	LOCATION	school at least as vigorously as its contemporaries over - rated it .

		Fourteen years ago
Messrs. Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	issued an illustrated edition of three of
Oliver Wendell Holmes	PERSON	's humorous poems : ` The Deacon 's Masterpiece , ' * How the Old Horse Won the Bet , ' and * The Broomstick Train , ' with illus - trations in black-and-white by Mr.
Howard Pyle	PERSON	.

		These publishers now offer a new edition of the book , -- which is entitled ` The
One-Hoss Shay	PERSON	, ' -- with the original illustrations re-drawn in color by the artist .

		Mr.
Pyle	PERSON	's humorous vein , which most of his admirers consider undoubtedly his most characteristic and delightful vein , could nowhere find better material for interpretation than that which Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	's genial wit fur - nishes .

		The choice between black-and-white and color is largely a personal one ; it is enough to say that the new edition is delightful .

		Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	's preface for the
1891	DATE	edition has been retained , and a note by the publishers speaks of the hearty approval he gave to Mr.
Pyle	PERSON	's orig - inal drawings .

		The volume entitled ` Saddle and Song ' is , as its name suggests , a compilation of verse about '' horses .

		It is published by the
Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	, the editor 's name being withheld .

		Every type of horse , -- the Arab steed , the equine hero of myth and romance , the clean-limbed racer , the Aus - tralian drover 's pony , the steeple-chase favorite , the horse ridden for idle pleasure , and the horse ridden to a glorious death , -- all find their pane - gyrists within these covers , so that every reader should be able to find a horse or a rider to his liking .

		There is one respect in which the collec - tion is incomplete , but the editor forestalls criti - cism by expressing his regret that he could find no satisfactory tribute to the western cow-pony 's prowess , except a few copyrighted pieces .

		Some old favorites are missing , doubtless for the same reason ; but within its limits the collection is a good one .

		There are a number of illustrations from paintings and photographs , and the general make-up of the book is attractive .

		Mr.
George Alfred Williams	PERSON	, illustrator of the
Baker	PERSON	and
Taylor Company	ORGANIZATION	's holiday edition of
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	's '
Christmas Carol	PERSON	' and ' The Cricket on the Hearth , ' has had the temerity to depart from the traditional method of picturing
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	's characters .

		As he explains in a prefatory note , he has tried to bring out the more human elements of the characterizations , instead of the grotesque and exaggerated comedy that appealed to Leech and other contemporary illustrators .

		There are five pictures for each story , and while they can - not of course compare in strength and originality with
Leech	ORGANIZATION	's work , we tliink that readers who are not wedded to the old tradition will like them very much , particularly younger readers , who are always repelled by the frank ugliness of the early illustrations .

		The volume is of quarto size , well made and printed .

		The cover has a quaint , old - time look that is very attractive .

		` Caroline of Courtlandt Street ' -LRB- Harper -RRB- is a slight but spirited novelette by Mr ,
Weymer Jay Mills	PERSON	.

		Its plot is laid in the year
1824	DATE	, when Courtlandt street was a synonym for aristocratic exclusiveness in
New York	LOCATION	, and when the Park Theatre was still in its prime .

		` Lady
Caroline	PERSON	' belongs to Courtlandt Street through her father 's family , but because her mother was ` the darling of the old Park , ' Courtlandt Street disowns her .

		Being an ambitious as well as a charming young person , she resolves to conquer both of her heredi - tary domains ; and the novel tells how she did it and why she stopped .

		Half a dozen very dainty colored pictures by Miss
Anna Whelan Betts	PERSON	, a series of over-elaborate page borders by Mr.
W. E. Mears	PERSON	, and an ornate cover make a distinc - tively holiday setting for this pretty story .

		Another attractive holiday novelette is Mr.
Ralph Henry Barbour	PERSON	's ` An Orchard Princess ' -LRB- Lippincott -RRB- .

		This is a story of today , the ac - tion taking place in `
Maple Green	ORGANIZATION	, ' an artists ' colony somewhere near
New York	LOCATION	.

		The wooing of the orchard princess is exceedingly entertain - ing , for the princess has a mind of her own and the hero shows much ingenuity in making it up according to his wishes .

		The artist colony life furnishes a good background , and
Bistre	PERSON	, the hero 's bull-dog , is an interesting factor of the situation .

		The decorative setting is charming .

		Mr.
James Montgomery Flagg	PERSON	has made four colored plates , and his chapter-headings and marginal drawings are artistic i ^ nd perfectly in keeping with the story .

		A vignette of the prin - cess , with a spray of apple-blossoms below it , set in a plain green background is the dainty and appropriate cover design .

		Readers of ` Scribner 's Magazine ' for the cur - rent vear have been enjoying Mr , F ,
Hopkinson Smith	ORGANIZATION	's chapters about the painter
MacWhirter	PERSON	and his circle of friends .

		Every month or so they have gathered around ` The Wood Fire in No , 3 , ' -- ` No. 3 ' being
MacWhirter	PERSON	's attic studio , -- to exchange greetings and stories of the mysterious or humorous or romantic adventures that they have encountered in various odd corners of the earth .

		These stories are now gathered into a volume , taking its title from the fire that in - spired them , and illustrated in colors by Mr.
Alonzo Kimball	PERSON	,
MacWhirter	PERSON	and his friends are thoroughly individual , but all alike endowed with the kindly Bohemian spirit of good-comrade - ship that is supposed to be characteristic of the artist profession .

		They all know stories well worth the telling , and they tell them extremely well .

		While not of a distinctively Christmas flavor , the ` Wood Fire ' stories are full of a holi -
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAIi 389 day spirit of good fellowship and good cheer , and ` The Wood Fire in No. 3 ' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- will make an excellent Christmas gift .

		` The Poet ,
Miss Kate	PERSON	, and I ' is one of those little idyls of
Arcadian	ORGANIZATION	life in country solitudes that are just now enjoying a large measure of popular favor .

		It is written ^ like many of its predecessors , in diary form , the hero and hero - ine taking turns in confiding their respective emotions and points of view to the reader .

		Miss
Kate	PERSON	is a horse , the fast friend and constant companion of the heroine , and just as impor - tant in the story as is the confidante in eight - eenth century comedy .

		The plot is slight , but the nature sketches , the character study , and a very piquant way of putting things , give the book a decided charm .

		This type of story lends itself well to a decorative edition , and the
Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	issue this example in pretty holiday dress with green page borders , colored frontisioieee , and an unusually artistic cover .

		So small as to be valuable chiefly as a curi - osity is Messrs.
T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's `
Minia	LOCATION	- ture Edition ' of ``
Washington	LOCATION	Irving 's selected works .

		The five tiny bibelots , in size 2 ^ by ll ^ inches , are bound in limp ooze leather , clearly printed on gilt-edged
India	LOCATION	paper , and slipped into a leather case that matches the covers .

		We have had pocket volumes before , but this is literally a pocket edition .

		The volumes contain four stories from ` The Sketch Book , ' seven of the ` Christmas Sketches , ' four legends from ` The
Alhambra	LOCATION	, ' and ten selections from ` Bracebridge Hall . '

		They can be read comfortably , though one 's fingers tend to become all thumbs in handling anything quite so tiny .

		` Womanhood in Art ' -LRB-
Paul Elder & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the rather unpropitious and very indeterminate title of a thin quarto volume by Mrs.
Phebe Estelle Spalding	PERSON	.

		It consists , in fact , of reproductions and brief interpretations of six great artistic con - ceptions of ideal womanhood : the
Venus de Milo	PERSON	,
Dagonet	ORGANIZATION	's Eve ,
Mona Lisa	PERSON	,
Beatriee Cenci	PERSON	, the
Madonna	PERSON	of the Chair , and the
Sistine Madonna	ORGANIZATION	.

		Tl ^ e reproductions , which are in tint , are excel - lent , and print , paper , and grey board covers are attractive .

		The text is intended neither for artists nor students of painting , but for the ordinary ob - server who is interested merely in the moral sig - nificance of the picture , caring nothing for its history or technique .

		Such criticism leans inevi - tably towards the fanciful and the sentimental , but it doubtless appeals to a certain class of read - ers .

		` Rhymes of Little Boys ' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- is the at - tractive title of a small volume of verse by Mr.
Burges Johnson	PERSON	.

		The ` RhjTiies ' are bound in plaid gingham , with decorated end-papers and title pasre .

		` Goin ' Barefoot , ' ` Bein ' Sick , ' ' Gettin ' Well , ' ' Buildin ' Fires , ' ' Cookin ' Things , ' ` Ketchin ' Rides , ' ' Pirates ' Cave , ' ' Nurses , ' and numerous other matters of vital interest to all small boys and their friends are treated with an understanding touch and much real humor .

		A few verses written from the grown-up point of view are included in the col - lection .

		Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	's * little boy ' rhymes are already well known to magazine readers .

		This volume is sure to win for its author a wider appreciation of his really unique work . '

		A Corner in Women and Other Follies ' -LRB-
Moffat , Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the title of an amus - ing collection of Mr.
Tom Masson	PERSON	's stories , epigrams , anecdotes , and skits .

		All the ` follies ' are clever , and there is plenty of variety in both subject and manner of treat - ment .

		One of Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	's drawings makes a most effective cover design , and another serves as frontispiece .

		The rest of the illus - trations and decorations are by
Gilbert	LOCATION	,
Kem	PERSON	- ble ,
Raymond Crosby	PERSON	, and half a dozen more of ` Life 's ' favorite illustrators .

		Motor fiends and motor haters can forget their quarrels and join in a hearty laugh over ` Auto Fun ' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , a collection of skits and drawings from the witty pages of ` Life . '

		Being the cream of ` Life 's ' opinions upon the subject , they are all clever and to the point .

		Here every scorcher will find his mishaps turned to jest , and his adventures and aspirations pictured in a fash - ion that he can not resent and that will none the less rejoice the hearts of his enemies and victims .

		` Auto Fun , ' with its novel cover design and abundance of real humor on a vital issue of the year , is sure to be a favorite with holiday buyers , who will like to take a subtle revenge upon their auto-owning friends by presenting them with this token of appreciation .

		` Songs o ' Cheer ' is the title of a new col - lection of Mr.
James Whitcomb Riley	PERSON	's verse , published by the
Bobbs-Merrill Company	ORGANIZATION	in a volume copiously illustrated by Mr.
Will Vawter	PERSON	.

		The verses include some copyrighted as early as
1883	DATE	, and others published as late as
1905	DATE	.

		There is a good deal of common - place work in the book , but there ace also bits here and there of Mr.
Riley	PERSON	at his best .

		The cheerful tone of the volume and its dec - orative features will appeal to holiday shoppers .

		` The Days and
Hours of Raphael	ORGANIZATION	' -LRB-
Grafton Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mrs.
Rachel A. La Fontaine	PERSON	, is a little manual of art study , substantially bound , copi - ously illustrated , and intended for the tyro in matters aesthetic .

		The full-page plates in half - tone , including , besides the seven ` Days ' and the twelve ` Hours , ' two portraits of
Raphael	PERSON	, are of excellent quality .

		The accompanying notes of explanation are very elementary , presupposing little knowledge of art or mythology on the part of the reader .

		It is a pity , considering her effort for simplicity , that the author does not couch her ideas in less obscure and tortuously constructed sentences .


Mary Allette Ayer	PERSON	, who last year com - piled a ` Daily Cheer Year Book , ' this season edits ` The Joys of Friendship ' -LRB-
Lothrop	ORGANIZATION	,
Lee & Shepard Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a similar collection of quoted passages .

		The extracts are arranged under six sub-headings , treating as many different phases of the subject .

		This being the centennial year of the birth of
William Lloyd Garrison	PERSON	, we commend the timeliness of a little book of brief selections from his writ - ings , now published by

		The

Bobert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	brings to a conclusion a set of books that all lovers of this much-loved writer will wish to have on their shelves .

		The text is of course complete and authori - tative , and the general form of the volumes makes them much more convenient for actual reading pur - poses than either of the two expensive subscription editions .

		The prefaces contributed by Mrs.
Steven	PERSON	- son to several of the volumes are always interesting , and often throw a new ray of light on `
R. L. S.	PERSON	' and his work .

		Messrs.

		The volume by Miss G ,
E. Mitton	PERSON	on `
Jane Austen	PERSON	and her Times , ' to be published shortly by the Messrs.

J. B. Lippimeott Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a substitute for a similar work made by the same compiler about thirty years ago , the plates of which were destroyed in the
Lippincott	ORGANIZATION	fire of
1899	DATE	.

		It is impossible to describe such a work as this except in some such terms as the editor 's ' a melange of excerpta . '

		It contains a great deal of curious information , which would also be useful if one only knew where to find it .

		But the total amount of curious information is so vastly greater than the amount compressible within a single volume that a book of this type is more useful for random reading than for reference pur - poses .

		The wonderful possibilities of the
Oxford India	ORGANIZATION	paper are given new illustration in two books re - centlv published by Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	for the
Clarendon Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first of these is a single - volume reprint of the `
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	' edition of
Boswell	ORGANIZATION	's
Johnson	PERSON	, originally issued a year ago in two vol - umes .

		The text is based on
Malone	PERSON	's edition of
1799	DATE	, and there is no new editorial matter , .

		We are so accustomed to BosweU in three or four stout volumes that it is difficult to reconcile him with this single trim little duodecimo .

		Even more re - markable is the new `
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	' edition of Shakes - peare , in which the complete works are presented in a clearly-printed volume no larger than an ordi - nary novel .

		A preface , index to characters , and glossary are contributed by Mr.
W. J. Craig	PERSON	.

		All the details of printing and binding are in perfect taste , and the edition seems to us the ideal single - volume Shakespeare .

		With an Introduction by
G. STANLEY	PERSON	HALL The author of this book , the founder of the

		Her dominant impulse is to bring parents and children into closer and more sympathetic relations .

		She believes that discord in the home is in most cases due to a lack of comprehension of child nature and its needs on the part of those who have the care of the child .

		There is abundant parental , self-sacrificing love , but that it must be supplemented by real knowledge of the child 's mental , moral , and physical nature .

		Through simple , practical illustrations of every-day occurrences the author makes clear to parents the impor - tance of being able to grasp the boy 's or the girl 's point of view , for only by so doing can they hope to gain the confidence of children and to guide them wisely .

General Sociology An Exposition of the Main Development	ORGANIZATION	in Sociological Theory , from
Spencer	LOCATION	to Ratzenhofer .

		By
ALBION W. SMALL Professor	ORGANIZATION	and Head of the department of Sociology in the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	.

		I N this important book Professor Small brings his wide reading and * keen analytical powers to bear on the history of sociology and its present claims to be regarded as a science .

		These claims have often been disputed , on the ground that the material of sociology has already been pre-empted by the recognized social sciences -- ethnolc ^ y , history , economics , etc. .

		Professor SmaU 's answer is that the work of co-ordi - nating these various groups , of surveying the process of human associa - tion as a whole , is a task distinct from that of a worker in one of the special fields , and that the body of knowledge so gained legitimately ranks as a science .

		In other words , sociology is to social science in general what neurology is to medicine .

		It is addressed to historians , economists , political scientists , psychologists , and moralists , quite as much as to sociologists .

		NOTES 449 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 451 SEEBS , MAKERS , BARDS .

		It would save much confusion in criticism if it could be recognized and remembered that there are three great orders of poetic minds .

		These answer well enough to the old titles for the poet -- Seer , Maker ,
Bard	LOCATION	.

		The Seer is the man of vision , the prophet , the recipient of inspiration from above .

		In primitive times he is the founder of religions ; in later days he is the expounder of philoso - phies .

		He is the dreamer of things past and to come .

		Oracles are on his lips .

		With a change of sex , he is the Pythoness or the
Sybil	PERSON	.

		He comes now in glorious guise ; he comes again in questionable shape .

		He is Zoroaster ,
Buddha	ORGANIZATION	,
Christ	LOCATION	, Mahomet .

		He is
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	,
Eousseau	LOCATION	,
Byron	PERSON	.

		He is the stormy petrel who precedes every change in the moral or intel - lectual weather of the world .

		He leads crti - sades of righteousness ; he draws men into pleasant pastures ; he warns them from abysses of wickedness .

		And when one good custom has corrupted a world he is just as apt as not to bring in evil , like an invading Paynim host , to rouse mankind from its complacent sloth .

		Many readers of
Georg Brandes	PERSON	's ` Main Currents in
Nineteenth	LOCATION	- Century Literature ' must have wondered at the importance the author attaches to writers like Chateaubriand , George Sand , and
Madame Kriidener	PERSON	, -- an im - portance altogether out of relation to the value their writings have now .

		But they bore the message their age needed .

		It was ApoUo and the Pythonesses come to answer the questions of a restless , craving world .

		And
Byron !	PERSON

		His personality and work were the evangel his dav desired .

		His voice shook
Europe	LOCATION	because it uttered oracles that came home to the hearts of a revolutionarv race .

		That is the pity of prophecy .

		When it is done , it is dead .

		When it is fulfilled nothing can make it thrill again .

		Except when based on profound metaphysical or religious thought , the Seer 's work is apt to be temporary and transient .

		It eruides the day .

		but the next dav needs a new direction .

		On the side of truth it is almost sure to be partial and incomplete ; on the side of art it usually has the qualiti ^ of improvisation .

		But when it is founded on eternal things , when it is accompanied by creative and literary power , it is the most ner - manent , the most serious , the most elevatinsr influence that enters into our lives .

		It is the ligbtningr that sweeps througrh our atmosphere and bums up the noxious vapors and refreshes the world .

		, ■ 428 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, The Maker is a person of another queer sort .

		He is not interested in the changes of opinion .

		He cares nothing for proselytizing or reforming mankind .

		He is absorbed in his work as a hen is in hatching out its eggs .

		And the eggs he broods upon are a new nature , a new life .

		No mere understudy of nature is he .

		He is a spark of the original creative mind .

		He pierces to the true ideas of which the visible world is a copy , and out of them he moulds his types and forms .

		Not for him to choose between good and evil ; not for him to guide and direct his fellows .

		Enough if he presents to them similars more vivid and vital than themselves .

		Think for a moment !

		On one side is the real earth , crystal built , clothed with leafage , overhung with clouds and stars , tramped over by the interminable procession of mankind .

		On the other side is a dream world , built out of frail sounds and signs .

		Which is the more real ?

		Anyone who has felt the power of liter - ature at all may hesitate to answer .

		Do we know our nearest friends , do we know ourselves as we know the great figures of literature ?

		Do we see any scenes in nature as we see those described and interpreted by the master poets ?

		Are the heroes of history as true to us as the men and women of the drama , epic , and novel ?

		Is Alexander a match for Achilles , or Philip the Silent as tremendous a presence as Hamlet ?

		It seems to me that there is only one answer to these questions .

		Besides , there is only one world of actuality .

		Though it change with the change of day and night , with the alternation of cloud and sun - shine , it is a tolerably constant spectacle .

		And human nature is tolerably constant , too .

		But there are a thousand worlds in literature .

		The world of Shakespeare differs more from the world of Homer than the actual English life differed from the Greek .

		The people of
Jane Austen	PERSON	are more distinct from the people of Shakespeare than were the real English men and women of the two periods .

		The dream projections of literature are therefore the actual world , plus the personality of the creating artist , plus his particular gift of piercing to the abstract and typical ideas of humanity and nature .

		In other words , the figures of life are always individuals ; the figures of literature are individuals made typical and colored by the preferences and prejudices of the writer .

		In actual life we only see silhouettes of our fellow human beings ; in literature we get the round .

		People revolve about each other , much as the moon revolves about the earth , always keeping one side on view .

		Other eyes may see other sides , but that does not help any one of us to a true image .

		This is the reason of the inferiority of history to literature .

		In history we may have the report of a hundred different spectators as to a character or an event .

		But the reports vary , conflict , contradict each other .

		It is impossible to get a true conspectus .

		The literary creation rises before us in plain air , it turns round and round before us .

		All its actions are visible , all its speech audible .

		And more than that , it is as though made of glass or woven air , -- all its inmost thoughts and feelings are revealed .

		The main business of the
Bard	ORGANIZATION	is with the form of his art -- with cadence , metre , phrase .

		Of course he must have something to reveal or tell , but how he speaks is of more import to him than what .

		In the modem point of view he is specifically the poet .

		The Seer may utter his message in any form of language .

		If his vision is true his speech will be pic - turesque ; if his emotions are deep it will pul - sate musically .

		The Maker may use verse or prose indifferently .

		The superior concentra - tion of verse may be an advantage to him ; but too much effort after beauty of phrase and perfection of cadence may spoil his broad ef - fects .

		It may give the impression of niggling , of littleness .


Stevenson	PERSON	, with all his style , is far inferior in general results to Scott or
Dumas	PERSON	.

		The two great romance writers were intent on telling their story , projecting their characters ; and they let their style take care of itself .


Stevenson	PERSON	's first concern was to dress every idea as it arose in the most becoming words .

		But the pure
Bardic	ORGANIZATION	poet has a right to dwell on words .

		With them he can work won - ders .

		He can almost dispense with meaning or story .

		It is hard to attach much meaning to
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's '
Kubla Khan	PERSON	' or to
Poe	PERSON	's ' Ula - lume , ' yet these pieces are among the poetic triumphs of our literature .

		Their miracles of cadence , their gleam and glow of words , hint unfathomable , undefinable things .

		They some - how touch chords in our nature which vibrate with ecstacy .

		Words , in fact , in metrical form share with music the power to stir the senses and the emotions .

		Music in words appeals directly to the senses , form and color appeal only indirectly through the mind .

		Music is therefore a more primitive quality in poetry than picture .

		Yet the gift to make language concrete , -- to visualize , to flash the image on the brain , is probably the highest quality of expression .

		Arnold objected to
Shelley	PERSON	that while he had the talent to con - trol sound , he lacked the intellectual power to command words .

		It is true .

		Compared to poets like
Collins	PERSON	or
Keats	PERSON	or
Tennyson	LOCATION	, he is thin and aerial -- haunting enough , but not rich and real .

		Of course the division of the poetic hierarchy into three families is a mere analysis of possi - bilities .

		Concrete poets refuse to fall abso - lutely into any one of the divisions .

		But some
1905	DATE	.

		J THE DTATi 429 one strain of blood is usually predominant .

		Of our English poets ,
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	is preeminently a maker .

		Solid flesh and blood was never set forth more convincingly .

		His language is a flawless , pellucid mirror to reflect his world .

		Spenser thought to be a Seer , but his dim allegories have little power or potency in them .

		He is the creator of a rich , many-colored cloud - • land .

		His verse , picturesque and harmonious as it is , has little of the true Bardic fire and splendor .

		The three strains or strands of power are more evenly woven into the texture of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's mind than of any other writer whatever .

		Yet at different periods of his life one or the other started into prominence .

		He began by playing with words until he attained the most cunning mastery of all their secrete of sound and glow .

		In the end his interest in mere language weakened , or else he tried to wrench it to purposes beyond its power .

		Towards the middle of his career he was the consummate Maker .

		He hurled forth his great creations with the unmoved indifference of nature itself .

		Good or bad , beautiful or hid - eous , it was all one to him as long as the figures were vivid , vital , energetic .

		It was not until his crowning period that absolute Seership fell upon him -- grief , anger , indignation wrought him into hatred for the actual world -- into sympathy with the ideal one .

		In his mightiest productions he resembles the Angel with the flaming sword , set at the gates of
Paradise	ORGANIZATION	, with humanity flying in the distance .

		Milton 's creative force exhausted itself in the production of one figure -- Lucifer .

		His prophetic gift kept him at the level of the Protestant theo - gony -- not perhaps a very high level .

		But his Bardic gift was supreme .

		He wrought harmonies which mean more than language can utter , and pictures which outdo the colors of the world .


Wordsworth	PERSON	and
Shelley	PERSON	were the latter day prophets ,
Coleridge	PERSON	and
Keats	PERSON	the Bards .

		The making impulse was weak in all of these , as it has been in most modem poets .

		We must turn to prose for our modern Makers .

		All over the world for the last hun - dred years or more the most powerfiil creative minds have done their spiritiiig in prose .

		It is unnecessary to call the roll of their names .

		The mere idea of the novelists calls up a vision of row after row , shelf after shelf , bookcase after bookcase of volumes in even sets .

		The only query is as to the permanence of this prodigious output .

		Lacking as it does the con - centration , the haunting cadences , the per - fected phrasing of verse ; lacking , too .

		The
Ibsen IjEtters	ORGANIZATION	.

		* The letters of
Henrik Ibsen	PERSON	, covering a period of a full half-century , have at last been made accessible to the English-reading public , and the volume which contains them is a work of enduring value .

		Written with no thought of publication , these letters have the stamp of absolute sincerity , and reveal one of the most impressive personalities of our time .

		How interesting they will seem to the public in general we do not venture to say .

		To the pres - ent writer , who found his way to Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	's most significant work
thirty years ago	DATE	, and who has ever since found in that work an unfailing source of spiritual refreshment , a moral tonic for the mood of despondency , and a trumpet - call to renewed endeavor in the hour of dis - heartenment , these letters have so deep an interest that no other personal revelation oi recent years may be brought into comparison with them .

		The extent to which others wiQ share our feeling for this book will depend almost wholly upon the extent of their acquaintance with the work of its author .

		The name of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	is a resounding one in the intellectual concerns of the present age , but it is safe to say that nine - tenths of those who use it -- whether invoking it as a watchword or setting it up for a target -- have only a fragmentary knowledge of the series of books that began with *
Catilina	PERSON	' and ended with * When We Dead Awake . '

		More partic - ularly it must be said that nine out of ten , and probably ninety-nine out of a hundred , of those who know ' A Doll Home , ' or ` Ghosts , ' or *
Hedda Gabler	PERSON	, ' must needs confess that they have never read ' Brand ' and ' Peer Gynt , ' Jfow as we have often said before , these are the two works that outweigh all the oihers .

		and to claim an acquaintance with their author without having read them is like claiming to know
Dante	ORGANIZATION	without * The Divine Comedy . '

		Shakespeare without ` Hamlet , ' and Goethe without ` Faust . '

		We imagine , then , that the newly-published letters will not reveal the full secret of their interest to any large number of English read - ers , since familiarity with the works that con - tain the very core of Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	's thought is the necessary prerequisite of such a revelation .

		A fashion in recent criticism has given us much vague discussion of the relations between liter - ature and life , and of the importance of bring - ing the one into contact with the other .

		430 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, refreshing to turn from this random philos - ophizing to the concrete case of a man whose ever-absorbing passion has been the realization of this ideal , in the double sense of making literature an agency for the enrichment of his own life , and for the ennoblement of the lives of others .

		To this effect he spoke , in
1880	DATE	, as follows : ` Everything that I have written has the closest possible connection with what I have lived through , even if it has not been my own personal experience ; in every new poem or play I have aimed at my own spiritual emancipation and purification -- for a man shares the responsibility and the guilt of the society to which he belongs .

		Hence I once wrote the fol - lowing dedicatory lines in a copy of one of my books : `` At .

		leve er krig med trolde i hjertets og hjernens hvselv ; at digte -- det er at holde dommedag over sig selv . '' '

		Life is indeed a conflict with the wild passions that would work their goblin will upon heart and brain , and the true poet must ever sit in judgment upon himself no less than upon the world .

		The words above quoted express the one aspect of an author 's responsibility ; the other was realized and accepted by the writer in
1865	DATE	, when his brain was teeming with ' Brand , ' and he wrote this confession to his closest friend : ` If I were asked to tell at this moment what has been the chief result of my stay abroad , 1 should say that it consisted in my having driven out of myself the aestheticism which had a great power over me -- an isolated aestheticism with a claim to independent existence , ^ stheticism of this kind seems to me now as great a curse to poetry as theology is to religion ... Is it not an in - expressibly great gift of fortune to be able to write ?

		But it brings with it great responsibility ; and I am now sufficiently serious to realize this and to be very severe with myself .

		An aesthete in Co - penhagen once said to me : `` Christ is really the most interesting phenomenon in the world 's his - tory . ''

		Tne aesthete enjoyed him as the glutton does the sight of an oyster .

		I have always been too strong to become a creature of that type ; but what the intellectual asses might have made of me if they had had me all to themselves , I know not ; it was you , dear
Bjornson	PERSON	, who prevented them doing as they would with me . '

		While we are on the subject of ` Brand , ' which is Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	's deepest work , and the most tremendous embodiment of his poetical enerary , some peculiarly interesting quotations from his correspondence may be given .

		He thus writes to
Bjomstjerne Bjornson	PERSON	of the inception of the work in
1865	DATE	: ' I threw to the winds all that I had been una - vailingly torturing myself with for a whole year , and in the middle of
July	DATE	began something new , which progressed as nothing has ever progressed with me before .

		The work is new , in the sense that T only began to write it then , but the subject and the mood have been weighing on me like a night - mare ever since the many lamentable political oc - currences at home first made me examine myself and the condition of our national life , and think about things that before had passed me lightly by .

		It is a dramatic poem , modern in subject , serious in tone , five acts in rhymed verse .

		... I work both in the morning and the afternoon , a thing I have never been able to do before .

		It is delight - fully peaceful here ; we have no acquaintances ; 1 read nothing but the Bible -- it has vigour and power . '

		In a letter of the following year , he says : ' I kept struggling with my poem for a whole year before it took shape clearly ; but once I had hold of it , I wrote from morning to night , and fin - ished it in less than three months . '

		And again , when the reaction from this mood of exaltation has come , he writes : ` Dear
Bjornson	PERSON	, it seems to me as if I were sep - arated from both God and men by a great , an in - finite void .

		Last
summer	DATE	when I was writing my drama , I was , in spite of all that harassed and per - plexed me , indescribably happy .

		I felt the exalta - tion of a Crusader , and I do n't know anything 1 should have lacked courage to face ; but there is nothing so enervating and exhausting as this hope - less waiting .

		I dare say this is only a transition period .

		I will and shall have a victory some day .

		If the powers that be have shown me so little favour as to place me in this world and make me what I am , the result must be accordingly .

		But enough of this . '

		In this connection , we are given the letter from which Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	quoted long ago , asserting that Brand might as well have been a sculptor or a politician as a priest .

		We also read : ` You surely will not blame me because the book may have given pietism something to lean on .

		You might just as well reproach Luther with having in - troduced Philistinism into the world ; it was cer - tainly not his intention to do so , and he must there - fore be held blameless . '

		He also takes occasion to defend the quan - tum satis and the deus caritatis of the mac - .

		sronic ending of ' Brand , ' and to say that he did not have
Kierkegaard	PERSON	particularly in his mind when he wrote the poem .

		But he adds : ' The presentment of a life which has as its aim the realization of ideals will always possess certain points of resemblance to the story of
Kierkegaard 's	ORGANIZATION	. '

		Concerning ' Peer Gynt , ' the companion - masterpiece of his great creative period , the author writes to his publisher and lifelong friend .

		Councillor Hegel : ` And now I must tell you that my new work is well under way , and will , if nothing untoward hap - pens , be finished early in the
summer	DATE	.

		It is to be a long dramatic poem , having as its chief figure one of those half-mythical , fanciful characters existing in the annals of the Norwegian peasantry of modern times .

		It will have no resemblance to Brand , will contain no direct polemic , etc ' A little later , we have these words : ' I am curious to hear how you like the poem .

		I am very hopeful myself .

		It may interest you to know that
Peer Gynt	ORGANIZATION	is a real person , who lived in
Gudbrandsdal	LOCATION	, probably at the end of last , or the beginning of this , century .

		His name is still well - known among the peasants there ; but of his ex -

		: THE
DIAX	ORGANIZATION	.

		431 ploits not much more is known than is to be found in
Asbjornsen	LOCATION	's Norwegian Fairy-Tale Book , in the section , `` Pictures from the Mountains . ''

		Thus 1 have not had very much to build upon , but so much the more liberty has been left me . '

		And again , the next year : * I learn that the book created much excitement in
Norway	LOCATION	.

		This does not trouble me in the least ; but both there and in
Denmark	LOCATION	they have discov - ered much more satire in it than was intended by me .

		Why can they not read the book as a poemf For as such I wrote it .

		The satirical passages are tolerably isolated .

		But if the Norwegians of the present time recognize themselves , as it would ap - pear they do , in the character of Peer Gynt , that is the good people 's own affair . '

		And with sublime self-confidence , he thus replies to the charge that ' Peer Gynt ' is lack - ing in the poetical character : ' My book is poetry ; and if it is not , then it will be .

		The conception of poetry in our country , in
Norway	LOCATION	, shall be made to conform to the book .

		There is no stability in the world of ideas .

		The Scandinavians of this century are not Greeks . '

		The excited controversy aroused by ' Ghosts ' has several echoes in the correspondence of
1882	DATE	: ' These last weeks have brought me a wealth of experiences , lessons , and discoveries .

		I was quite prepared for my new play eliciting a howl from the camp of the stagnationists ; and I care no more for this than for the barking of a pack of chained dogs .

		But the alarm which I have observed among the so-called Liberals has given me cause for reflection .

		The very day after my play was published , the Dagblad rushed a hurriedly written article into print , with the evident purpose of at once render - ing any suspicion that it approved of my play im - possible , iliis was entirely unnecessary .

		I my - self am responsible ^ or what I write , I and no one else .

		I can not possibly bring trouble on any party ; for I do not belong to any .

		I stand like a solitary franctireur at the outposts and act on my own re - sponsibility .

		` The only man in
Norway	LOCATION	who has stood up frankly , boldly , and courageously for me is
Bjorn	PERSON	- son .

		It is just like him ; he has , in truth , a great , a kingly soul ; and I shall never forget what he has done just now .

		` But how about all these champions of liberty who have been frightened out of their witsf Is it only in the domain of politics that the work of emancipation is to be permitted to go on with usf Must not men 's minds be emancipated first of allf Men with such slave-souls as ours can not even make use of the liberties they already possess .


Norway	LOCATION	is a free country , peopled by unfree men and women . '

		• There is not in the whole book a single opinion , a single utterance , which can be laid to the ac - count of the author .

		I took good care to avoid this .

		The method , the technique of the construc - tion in itself entirely precludes the author 's appear - ing in the speeches .

		My intention was to produce the impression in the mind of the reader that he was witnessing something real .

		Now , nothing would more effectually prevent such an impression than the insertion of the author 's private opinions in the dialogue .

		Do they imagine at home that I have not enough of the dramatic instinct to be aware of this ?

		Of course I am aware of it , and act accord - ingly .

		And in no other play which I have written is the author such an outsider , so entirely absent , as in this last one .

		` Then they say that the book preaches nihilism .

		It does not .

		It preaches nothing at aU .

		It merely points out that there is a ferment of nihilism under the surface , at home as elsewhere .

		And this is in - evitable .

		A Pastor
Manders	PERSON	will always rouse some Mrs.
Alving	PERSON	to revolt .

		And just because she is a woman , she will , once she has begun , go to great extremes . '

		` It may well be that the play is in several re - spects rather daring .

		But it seemed to me that the time had come when some boundary-posts required to be moved .

		And this was an undertaking for which an older writer like myself was more fitted than the many younger authors who might desire to do something of the kind . '

		Readers of Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	's works know how strongly he emphasizes the idea of a man 's mission or calling -LRB- kald -RRB- .

		In * The Pretend - ers , ' in * Brand / in ' Peer Gynt / and in * Emperor and Galilean / this conception appears in varying shapes , and in each case it is the very foundation of the psychological structure .

		The author 's conception of his own calling appears in many passages of his letters , in the following , perhaps , -LRB- 1879 -RRB- as distinctly as anywhere : ` As long as a people considers it more important to build meeting-houses than theatres , as long as it is readier to support the
Zulu Mission	ORGANIZATION	than the Art Museum , art can not really thrive , can not even be considered as of immediate necessity .

		I do not think it is of much use to plead the cause of art with arguments derived from its own nature , which with us is still so little understood , or rather so thoroughly misunderstood .

		What is needed first of all with us is to fall upon and eradicate all that gloomy medieval monasticism which narrows the view and stupefies the mind .

		My opinion is that at the present time it is of no use to wield one 's weapons for art ; one must simply turn them against what is hostile to art .

		, First clear this away , and then we can build . '

		To act as the physician of the age , to point out the festering sores in the social and political organism , and to sear them with irons heated to whiteness in the furnace of the poet 's indig - nation , -- this was his mission , and for its sake he scorned delights and lived laborious days , exiling himself from home and country , preach - ing austere and uncomfortable doctrine to unwilling ears , and alienating his friends -- even the one friend for whom his heart most yearned -- by his uncompromising rectitude of soul . '

		Friends are an expensive luxuyy / he once wrote to
Georg Brandes	PERSON	, ` And when a man 's whole capital is invested in a calling and a mission in life , he can not afford to keep them .

		The costliness of keeping friends does not lie in what one does for them , but in what one , out of consideration for them , refrains from doing .

		This means the crushing of many an intellectual germ .

		I have had personal experience of it ; and there are , consequently , many years behind me dur - ing which it was not possible for me to be myself . '

		Who , knowing the history of the man 's life , and its significance for contemporary humanity .

		432 THE DIALi -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	'' could read the foregoing words unmoved , or the following words of appeal to the King for support : ` It is not for a care-free existence I am fighting , but for the possibility of devoting myself to the task which I believe and know has been laid upon me by God -- the work which seems to me more important and needful in
Norway	LOCATION	than any other , that of arousing the nation and leading it to think great thoughts .

		It remains with your Majesty to decide whether or not I shall have to keep silence , and suffer the bitterest disappointment which can befall a human soul -- the disappointment of hav - ing to give up my life-work , of having to surren - der when I know myself to be in possession of ex - actly the intellectual weapons required . '

		The dignity of this appeal vies with its pathos , and both are equally impressive .

		Dt .

		Ibsen went into voluntary exile , as is well known , because he found the intellectual and moral atmosphere of his native land too stifling to breathe , and because freedom , both of thought and of its related action , was indis - pensable to his spiritual development .

		He writes to Fru Thoresen : ' I had to get away from the beastliness up there before I could begin to be purified .

		I could never lead a consistent spiritual life there ; I was one man in my work and another outside of it -- and for that very reason my work failed in consistency too .

		I am aware that my present standpoint is in all prob - ability only a transitory one , but I do feel solid ground under my feet . '

		Here is a fine outburst of indignation and defi - ance , occasioned by the rough treatment accorded to '
Peer Gynt	ORGANIZATION	' by some of its critics : ` However , I am glad of the injustice that has been done me .

		There has been something of the God-send , of the providential dispensation in it ; for I feel that this anger is invigorating all my pow - ers .

		If it is to be war , then let it be war !

		If I am no poet , then I * have nothing to lose .

		I shall try my luck as a photographer .

		My contemporaries in the North I shall take in hand , one after the other , as I have already taken the nationalist language reformers .

		I will not spare the child in the mother 's womb , nor the thought or feeling that lies under the word of any living soul that deserves the honour of my notice . '

		Some
fifteen years later	DATE	, the letters to Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	yield the following revealing passages : ' I have not the gifts that go to make a satis - factory citizen , nor yet the gift of orthodoxy ; and what I possess no gift for , I keep out of .

		Liberty is the first and highest condition for me .

		At home they do not trouble much about liberty , but only about liberties -- a few more or a few less , accord - ing to the standpoint of their party . '

		` You are , of course , right when you say that we must all work for the spread of our opinions .

		But I maintain that a fighter in the intellectual van - guard can never collect a majority round him .

		In ten years the majority will , possibly , occupy the standpoint which Dr.
Stockmann	ORGANIZATION	held at the public meeting .

		But during these ten years the Doctor will not have been standing still ; he will still be at least ten years ahead of the majority .

		He can never have the majority with him .

		As regards myself , at least , I am conscious of incessant pro- gression .

		At the point where I stood when I wrote each of my books , there now stands a tolerably compact crowd ; but I myself am no longer there ; I am elsewhere ; farther ahead , I hope . '

		The solitude to which all great souls are con - demned by the very fact of their greatness , the yearning for a companionship that they never find , finds poignant expression in one of the latest letters of all , a letter written in
1897	DATE	, after the writer 's return to
Norway	LOCATION	.

		` Can you guess what I am dreaming about , and planning , and picturing to myself as something de - lightful ?

		The making a home for myself near the Sound between
Copenhagen	LOCATION	and
Elsinore	LOCATION	, on some free , open spot , whence I can see all the sea-going ships starting and returning from their long voy - ages .

		That i can not do here .

		Here all the sounds are closed , in every acceptation of the word -- and all the channels of intelligence are blocked .

		Oh , dear
Brandes	PERSON	, it is not without its consequences that a man lives for twenty-seven years in the wider , emancipated and emancipating spiritual con - ditions of the great world .

		Up here , by the fjords , is my native land .

		But -- but -- but !

		Where am I to find my home-land ? '

		The limitations of space forbid our continu - ation of these extracts , although we should like to include a series of passages to illustrate the author 's political creed , another series con - cerning his relations with
Bjomstjerne Bjom	PERSON	- son , another from the correspondence with his helpful and devoted publisher and friend -LRB- Councillor
Hegel	PERSON	of the great house of Gyld - endal -RRB- , and still another to comprise the occa - sional glimpses which we get of his feelings toward father , mother , and sister in his native town of Skien .

		But for these , and other weighty matters , we must refer to the book itself , from which we make one further draft in closing .

		` So to conduct one 's life as to realize one 's self -- this seems to me the highest attainment possible to a human being .

		It is the task of one and all of us , but most of us bungle it . '

		This is the sum and substance of the author 's teaching , the burden of his message to an age made flabby by compromise , and impoverished in the very springs of its vitality by the weak - ening of the individual will .

		THE DIAL , 433 pansion of ciyilization the terrae incognitae have become more remote and increasingly dif - ficult of access , but the zest for exploration and love of adventure is not thereby daunted - Neither have books of travel and exploration abated their interest nor lost their constituency .

		To an English -- and let us hope equally to an American -- reading public a book of polar exploration needs no introduction to its old yet ever new charm , and calls for no apology or labored discourse on the value of its scien - tific results .

		Captain
Scott	PERSON	's account of ` The Voyage of the Discovery ' strikes a responsive chord in every lover of adventure , in every admirer of heroic effort .

		In the annals of English explorations the name ' Discovery ' has had an honorable and glorious history .

		Xo less than six ships of famous exploring expeditions have added to its lustre .

		The first , in
1602	DATE	to
1616	DATE	, made six voyages into the Arctic regions , under the com - mand , for a time at least , of the famous navi - gator
William Baffin	LOCATION	.

		The names of
Captain Cook	ORGANIZATION	, of
Vancouver	LOCATION	, and of
Stevenson	PERSON	are as - sociated with its later successors .

		The latest to be christened with the historic name was the ship specially constructed for exploration in high latitudes which carried the recent English Xational Antarctic Expedition safelv through two winters in the ice of the
South Polar Sea	LOCATION	.

		Captain
Scott	PERSON	's ' Discover -RCB- - ' was not built on the lines of Professor
Xansen	PERSON	's ' Fram , ' to slip easily above the surface of the crowding ice when caught in the terrific pressure of the pack , but rather on those which gave her greater seaworthiness and much greater powers as an ice-breaker , -- both prime desiderata for a vessel which must withstand the extreme and fitful weather of high southern latitudes and must also push its way through the vast fring - ing ice pack to the open sea beyond , on both ihe outgoing and the return trips .

		Accordingly , massive walls of oak , greenheart , and mahog - any , two feet in thickness , supported by hugh timbers , formed the bow of the vessel , while her sides and stem were well protected to stand immense lateral pressure .

		Her lines were those of the ' Discovery ' of the Arctic expedition of
1875	DATE	, a type evolved in the
Green	ORGANIZATION	- land whaling industry , with overhanging stem especially serviceable in ramming and breaking the pack ice .

		The equipment of the expedition was the best that could be devised in the light of the experience of former explorers .

		It comprised Xansen sledges and cookers for long sledge joumevs , Xorwegian skis , pemmican from
Copenhagen	LOCATION	, dogs from the Samoyedes , rein - deer sleeping bags , felt boots from
Eussia	LOCATION	, reindeer fur boots or finneskoes from Xprway , and grass -LRB- sennegrae ? -RRB-

		from
Lapland	LOCATION	for the protection of feet in the frozen fur boots , a balloon , great stores of explosives for blasting the ice pack , food for three years , tents , boats , lumber for huts , scientific instruments and paraphernalia galore .

		Xo wonder that every available inch was stowed full , and that the decks were piled high with freight !

		Though the vessel and her equipment re - flected to a high degree the experiences of the past in polar exploration , the personnel of the expedition contained but little seasoned timber , -- indeed but two of the oflBcers -LRB- the navigator and one of the surgeons -RRB- had had any previous experience in the arduous and particular labors of travel amidst polar snow and ice .

		Captain
Scott	PERSON	relates with refreshing frankness the blunders and mistakes into which his inexpe - rienced party fell , difficulties with dogs and sledges , the damage and the almost total loss of the boats , the failures of their dogs , and not the least a serious outbreak of scurvy .

		The age of the members would have met with Dr.
Osier	PERSON	's approval .

		Only one had attained the dead line of forty , and the average age of the ward room mess was little over twenty-four years !

		Captain
Scott	PERSON	himself is enthusiastic in his approval of the youth of his companions , ` concerning the advantages of which I could write many pages . '

		The discipline aboard ship was excellent , and the success of the expedition was not marred by bickerings and strife as it has been in the case of some polar parties .

		* It must be understood that the `` Discovery '' not being in
Government	ORGANIZATION	employment , had no more stringent regulations to enforce discipline than those which are contained in the Merchant Ship - ping Act , and however adequate these may be for commercial purposes , they fail to provide that guarantee for strict obedience and good behaviour which I believe to be a necessity for such excep - tional conditions as exist in Polar service .

		Through - out our three-years ' voyage in the `` Discovery '' the routine of work , the relations between officers and men , and the general ordering of matters were , as far as circumstances would permit , precisely such as are customary in His Majesty 's ships .

		We lived exactly as though the ship and all on board had been under the Xaval Discipline Act ; and as every - one must have been aware that this pleasing state of affairs was a fiction ^ the men deserve as much credit as the officers , if not more , for the fact that it continued to be observed . '

		The r ^ on chosen by the scientific commit - tee in charge of the expedition as the field for the work of the ` Discovery ' was the
Ross	PERSON	quadrant to the south of
Xew Zealand	LOCATION	, the best known of the Antarctic regions .

		It was here that land masses and mountains were known to exist , that highest latitudes could be reached ; and .

		moreover , it was nearest to the magnetic pole .

		In addition to the magnetic , meteoro - logical , geological , oceanographic , and biolog - ical investigations incident to an expedition 434 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, into these latitudes .

		Captain
Scott	PERSON	had the fol - lowing geographical problems to solve : ` To explore the ice-barrier of Sir
James Eoss	PERSON	to its eastern extremity ; to discover the land which was believed by
Ross	PERSON	to flank the barrier to the eastward , or to ascertain that it does not exist , and generally to endeavor to solve the very important physical and geographical questions connected with this remarkable ice-formation .

		... If you should decide to winter in the ice your efforts as re - gards geographical exploration should be directed to three objects , namely -- an advance into the west - ern mountains , an advance to the south , and an ex - ploration of the volcanic region . '

		This is an ambitious programme .

		How ad - mirably it was carried out can best be judged by a careful perusal of Captain
Scott	PERSON	's modest story of his efforts and an inspection of the results of other Antarctic expeditions .

		The ' Discovery ' expedition left
England	LOCATION
August 5 , 1901	DATE	, and returned
three years later	DATE	, having spent two winters within the Antarctic circle fast in the ice in
McMurdo	LOCATION	Sound not far from the famous volcanoes
Mts	ORGANIZATION	.

		Erebus and Terror .

		Before entering winter quarters the ' Discovery ' was able to explore the whole face of the Great Ice Barrier which extends over 34 ° of longitude eastward of
South Victoria Land	LOCATION	.

		Its eastern limits were established by the discovery in longitude 150 ° W. , of
King Edward VII	ORGANIZATION	.

		Land .

		Its present face has re - ceded from twenty to thirty miles since it was surveyed by Sir
James Eoss	PERSON	sixty years ago .

		This fact agrees with the evidences of glacial recession in the land ice .

		Captain
Scott	PERSON	argues that this great ice sheet , hundred of miles in extent , is afloat , basing his conclusions upon soundings along its face , upon temperatures taken in crevasses , its rise and fall with the tide , and the regularity of the tremendous radial crevasses twenty to thirty miles in length which form in its margin where great glaciers from the inland ice cap of Victoria Land join it .

		A displacement of 608 yards in thirteen months of one of the depots established near its margin indicates considerable move - ment in this huge field of ice .

		The height above sea level of its free sea-worn face reaches a maximum of 380 feet , and its mean thickness is estimated to approximate 900 feet .

		Exami - nation from the balloon , and the various sledge journeys from winter quarters , indicate that the Great Ice Barrier is a monotonous level field of ice , devoid of life or of relief of any sort save that which the fierce and fitful winds that sweep with terrific violence over its surface give to the sastrugi or snow waves on its sur - face .

		It was along the western margin of this Great Barrier that Captain
Scott	PERSON	made a memorable sledging journey to the southward in the
summer of 1902	DATE	.

		The results of this jour - ney , lasting ninety-three days and covering 960 statute miles , afford a very complete survey of the western boundary of the Barrier and the eastern mountains of Victoria Land to lati - tude of 83 ° S. , nearly 5 ° beyond all previ - ous records .

		Photographs , panoramas , and sketches , as well as multitudinous observations , make the record of this journey exceptionally complete .

		The unique story of this long but successful struggle with nature in her wildest moods , against appalling odds , forms one of the most thrilling chapters in the history of polar ex - plorations .

		The battle with repeated blizzards , and the fearful cold , the toilsome march with the heavily laden sledges through the yielding snow or over the rough sastrugi ^ the oft-recur - ring frost bites , the blinding glare of the snow , the scant food supply , the horrible nights in frozen or chill and damp sleeping bags , re - lieved only by oft-repeated but never realized dreams of an ample meal , and worst of all the slow but certain inroads of scurvy , -- all these combine to heighten the heroism of Captain
Scott	PERSON	and his two companions .

		One of the greatest discomforts in sledging arises from the difficulty of resting in the fur sleeping bags , which gather the snow and moisture and soon double their weight with the accumulating ice , which can not be removed even in the heat of the so-called
summer	DATE	of the Antarctic . '

		A night in such a sleeping-bag as we are pictur - ing , with the temperature below 40 ° , can not be said to be less than horribly uncomfortable ... Ordinarily , we sleep in the fitful , broken , comfort - less fashion of which the mere recollection is a nightmare , and even this poor apology for slum - ber does not come until we have lain broad awake and shivering for an hour or two .

		` With the temperature at -- 48 ° we can make a shrewd guess as to the sort of night that is before us .

		The first half-hour is spent in constant shift - ing and turning , as each inmate of the bag tries to make the best of his hard mattress or to draw the equally hard covering closer about him .

		There is a desultory muffled conversation broken by the chattering of teeth .

		Suddenly the bag begins to vibrate , and we know that someone has got the shivers .

		It is very contagious , this shivering , and paroxysm after paroxysm passes through the whole party ... Presently we hear our neighbour marking time , and we rather unnecessarily ask him if his feet are cold ; he explains their exact state in the most forcible language at his command . '

		In the following winter Captain
Scott	PERSON	made a sledge journey on to the ice cap which covers the great plateau of Victoria Land , ` the most desolate region of the world .

		There is none other that is at once so barren , so deserted , so piercingly cold , so wind swept , so fearsomely monotonous . '

		The elevation of this great snow plain is about 9,000 feet , and above it tower naked and barren peaks or nunataks to eleva - tions of over 15,000 feet .

		Captain
Scott	PERSON	spent eighty-one days in a toilsome journey up the glacier to this plateau and over its undulating

		He closes his rec - ord with a * devout hope that wherever my future wanderings may trend , they will never again lead me to the summit of Victoria Land / One of the dangers incident to travel on the ice is that from crevasses hidden by the snow .

		Into one of these fathomless blue depths Cap - tain
Scott	PERSON	and one of his two companions were suddenly precipitated , ` Personallv I remember absolutely nothing until I found mvself dangling at the end of my trace with blue walls on either side and a very horrid - looking gulf below ; large ice-crystals dislodged by our movements continued to be showered down on our heads .

		As a first step I took ofif my goggles ; I then discovered that
Evans	PERSON	was hanging just above me .

		I asked him if he was all right , and re - ceived a reassuring reply in his usual calm matter - of-fact tones .

		Meanwhile I groped about on every side with my cramponed feet , only to find every - where the same slippery smooth wall .

		But my struggles had set me swinging and at one end of a swing my leg suddenly struck a projection ... I found myself standing on a thin shaft of ice which was wedged between the walls of the chasm -- how it came there I can not imagine , but its po - sition was wholly providential ; to the right or left , above or below , there was not the vestige of another such support -- nothing , in fact , but the smooth walls of ice ... With two of us on top and one be - low , things had assumed a very different aspect , and I was able to unhitch my own harness and lower it once more for
Evans	LOCATION	; then with our united efforts he also was landed on the surface , where he ar - rived in the same frost-bitten condition as I had .

		For a minute or two we could only look at one an - other , then
Evans	PERSON	said , `` Well , I 'm blowed '' ; it was the first sign of astonishment he had shown . '

		Not the least interesting part of Captain Scotf s narrative are his references to the ani - mal life of the Antarctic .

		` There are no land mammals , properly so called , within the
Antarctic Circle	ORGANIZATION	.

		There are no
South Polar	LOCATION	bears ; there are no Antarctic foxes ; there are no large mammals of any sort or kind save whales , which live entirely in the water , and seals , which spend more than half their time there . '

		Geology has not disclosed to us any lost
Antarc	PERSON	- tic mammalian fauna , although it has suggested to US the possibility that at one time there was a cli - mate , and perhaps a vegetation , that might have suited it ... Separated now by some hun - dreds of miles of very stormy ocean from the near - est habitable lands , with currents of wind and water all setting in precisely the wrong direction , it maintains an almost perfect barrenness .

		_ ' The Antarctic continent now boasts of a vegeta - tion which includes a few low forms of moss ' ^ and lichen , and a terrestrial fauna which consists of one minute and primitive form of wingless insect .

		Of the whales and seals and birds , the last-named alone have any pretension at all to a terrestrial habit of life , in that they use the moraines and rocky cliffs of the continental shores as nesting sites .

		But they are all pelagic sea-birds . '

		The expedition was particularly fortunate in having the services of several excellent photographers and of the surgeon-artist Dr.
Wilson	PERSON	.

		The latter 's sketches of the wonder - ful mock suns seen on the Great Barrier , and of the aurora australis are unique ; while his studies of the great Emperor penguins con - stitute a most interesting bit of natural his - tory .

		The two volumes are very fully illus - trated by most excellent reproductions of well selected photographs , which in themselves constitute a record of the expedition of a most interesting nature .

		In this particular these volumes of polar travel easily surpass all previously-published accounts of exploration at either pole .

		Captain Scotf s narrative is very full of de - tail , -- confessedly so , for the sake of utility to others who would attempt a similar enter - prise .

		But it never becomes tedious thereby , indeed one 's interest is rather increased by the fulness and care with which the story is told .

		The freshness and novelty of the sub - ject matter command an immediate hearing , and the charm of the narrative , the well bal - anced perspective , and above all the manly record of heroic endeavor here revealed bid fair to make Captain
Scott	PERSON	's modest account one of the classics of polar exploration .

		Doubtless there were many favoring circum - stances which enabled the expedition to make this phenomenal record , -- a lucky choice for winter quarters in close proximity to a feasi - ble southern route , and favorable movements of the ice-pack which gave it the chance to reach high latitudes and to escape again with the ship .

		But after all is said , a large modicum of praise is due to this intrepid explorer and his plucky company for the untiring zeal which they exhibited in pushing forward the confines of knowledge in the Antarctic by almost super - human efforts , in physical discomfort and amidst dangers that would have appalled most men even of Anglo-Saxon blood .

		To the Hst of British names illustrious in the annals of exploration , to those of
Drake	ORGANIZATION	,
Cook	LOCATION	,
Baffin	LOCATION	,
Franklin	PERSON	, Boss , and Nares , should be added that of

		* Mr.
Justin McCarthy	PERSON	has employed the years of his ill health and enforced withdrawal from political life in preparing various works of his - torical character dealing primarily with the reign of Queen
Victoria	PERSON	.

		He now presents the fourth and fifth volumes of his ' History of Our Own Times , ' the first two volumes of which appeared many years ago , followed much later by a third volume .

		In the words of the preface , these two concluding volumes • A History of Our Own TntES .

		436 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, ` have for their object in the first instance to give a clear and comprehensive account of all the events of public importance occurring in or to the
British Empire	ORGANIZATION	during the years between Queen
Victoria	PERSON	's
Diamond Jubilee	ORGANIZATION	and the accession of
King Edward the Seventh	ORGANIZATION	.

		But , besides this ob - vious object , the volumes include a retrospect of the important changes which the reign of Queen
Victoria	PERSON	saw in the public life , the literature , art , and science -- more especially the applied science -- of that period , the changes which have come about in the habits and manners of the time ; and also the leading characteristics of the men and women who have grown into celebrity during these later years . '

		This quotation sufficiently indicates the pur - pose of the author and the scope of his work .

		As in the previous volumes , Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	's method is that of the high class journalist rather than that of the historian ; and in this is to be found the chief charm of his work , for the reader ob - tains the acute impressions of a contemporan - eous observer of events , presented in a pleasing and clear style .

		Some of the principal condi - tions thus described are , in Volume IV. , the development of the policy of colonial federation , with resulting difficulties in
South Africa	LOCATION	, the European aspect of the Greek-Turkish war , the reconquest of
Egypt	LOCATION	, the `
Boxer	PERSON	' troubles in
China	LOCATION	, the American intervention in
Cuba	LOCATION	, and , in home politics , industrial questions , church rituals , woman 's suffrage , and the ordinary par - liamentary happenings not treated under other headings .

		In Volume V. the only topic of extra-English interest treated at length is the war in
South Africa	LOCATION	, the greater portion of the volume being given to purely insular politics , and to characterizations and retrospect of men and conditions of the entire Victorian era .

		From none of these chapters does the reader obtain any new information of historical importance , for Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	has simply thrown into at - tractive form the current newspaper knowledge of the events themselves .

		Nor is any real criti - cism offered , for the author is so consistently generous in his attitude toward the leading men of
England	LOCATION	that he sees only , or at least states only , their good qualities .

		It is certainly not historically true , for example , that
Gladstone	PERSON	's motives were never attacked by his political opponents ; and yet Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	in a chapter wholly laudatory in its character , on ' The Death of
Gladstone	LOCATION	, ' asserts that ' Even his -LSB- Glad - stone 's -RSB- most unyielding political opponents never believed him guilty of adopting any course for the sake of mere party interests or of taking up any cause for the reason that It was popular , and that its advocacy might strengthen the Administration of which he was the leader . '

		Possibly Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	would make a distinction between an attack by political opponents upon the motives of
Gladstone	LOCATION	, and the real belief of those same opponents in their purity .

		But when Mr.
Morley	PERSON	has found it necessary to devote much space in his
Life of Gladstone	ORGANIZATION	to a defense of
Gladstone	ORGANIZATION	's seemingly sudden conversion to a Home Rule policy , it would certainly appear that he at least believed in the sincerity of the criticisms made .

		For Mr.
Morley	PERSON	's defense is a defense of the motives , not of the act itself .

		If , then , these additional volumes of the ' History of Our Own Times ' contain no new material and are not critical , in what way are they of any historical importance ?

		In none save in the impression received , even though not distinctly stated , of the author 's own personal attitude toward men and events .

		For Mr.
Mc	PERSON	-
Carthy	PERSON	is himself a man of historical importance whose opinions it would be well worth while to Ivnow , even if only with the purpose of estimat - ing his attitude , and the attitude of the party , to which he belonged , toward leading personages and conditions in recent English history .

		As already indicated , it is wholly impossible to know how the author really estimates the men of this period .

		And even with regard to events and conditions , the same non-critical character - istics render any understanding of the author 's personal convictions diflBcult .

		Yet he certainly has them , and occasionally they peep out from the carefully worded resume he offers .

		Taking for granted his belief in the justice and wisdom of Home Rule for
Ireland	LOCATION	, to the attainment of which Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	has devoted his political life , his most marked revelations of self are centered about four topics .

		He is distinctly not attracted by the modern cry of ' Imperialism , ' caustically remarking that this more eupheumis - tic term has come to be applied in late years to what was once spoken of in contempt , or at least in derogation , as ' Jingoism . '

		Again , while he is eminently just in detailing the proof offered before the Parliamentary committee that in - vestigated the extent of the participation of
Rhodes	LOCATION	and of
Chamberlain	PERSON	in the famous '
Jameson	PERSON	Raid , ' he unquestionably sympathise with that minority which believed the committee unwilling to probe the matter to the bottom .

		In the third place , in a chapter entitled ' Here 's a Woman Would Speak ' he notes the steady devel - opment of the woman 's suffrage principle in municipal and county organizations , and by his friendly discussion of the greater issues of na - tional voting and representation shows at least an open mind and a sympathetic attitude towaxd the general movement , though he does not prophesy and does not distinctly state his own principles .

		And finally and chiefly , he is think - ing and writing of a world that has passed , of men that have played their part and have dis - appeared from the scene of action , of events that have had historical importance but are no longer

		487 intimately related with the world of to-day .

		It may seem impossible that one writing of so recent a period should acquire so remote a point of view , yet the impression is there and is perhaps intentionally conveyed .

		For Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	cer - tainly feels and makes his readers feel that the Victorian era is closed , and that the men who took important parts in those years can not , and have not , been replaced in the present English political world .

		His two volumes are divided into twenty-four chapters , of which four specifi - cally deal with the death lists of separate years , while two others are devoted to summaries of the careers of
Gladstone	PERSON	and of Queen
Victoria	PERSON	respectively , so that one-sixth of the contents of his work is concerned with what may be called obituary reminiscences .

		In addition to all this , one of the two concluding chapters of *
Ketro	PERSON	- spect ' consists of personal impressions of parlia - mentary leaders who died at a time earlier than the period of which these later volumes treat .

		This striking characteristic of Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	's work is surely illuminative of his own temper of mind ; and while it may be regarded as a flaw in his method of treatment , it nevertheless adds much to our understanding of the author .

		The first two volumes of this history , written at a time when the author was closely con - nected with the men he described , and the events he narrated , glowed with the vigor of enthusias - tic participation , and conveyed something of the glamour of autobiographical statement .

		In these later volumes he is the intelligent observer , but lacking in the inspiration that comes with in - timate knowledge .

		Yet the most persistent feel - ing with the reader will be one of regret that the author should realize so profoundly and un - necessarily the close of his own distinguished political career , -- a regret the more keen when it is remembered that he still holds a unique position as the clearest and most entertaining narrator of modem political events .

		For while in honest criticism it must be frankly stated that this * History ' is no history at all in the proper use of the term , it is never - theless true that Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	has succeeded in conveying in better form than has previously been done a mass of logical selected information about the last years of
Victoria	LOCATION	's reign .

		His vol - umes may be considered as the highest form of such productions as the ' Annual Register , ' sys - tematized and made consecutive .

		To this he has added personal characterizations , which , while invariably too generous , yet leave a clear impression of the person described .

		His last chapter of ' Retrospect ' is not so valuable , for it is merely a summary of physical and scientific changes that have taken place during the cen - tury , and contains no real analysis of the effects of such changes on national character or life .

		But Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	is always readable , and the entertaining quality of his work will undoubt - edly be of value in bringing to the negligent reader some familiarity , at least , with the main features of later English politics .

		The work is illustrated with sixteen portraits , and the last volume contains a good index , - g j ^ Ad-ams

		* It is not often that biographers so discrimin - ating , painstaking , and appreciative as Messrs.
M. H. SpieLmann	PERSON	and
G. S. Layard	PERSON	are per - mitted to exercise their gifts upon material so delightfully adapted to their purposes as that which clusters about the name of
Kate Green	ORGANIZATION	- away .

		Their joint biography , drawing its lit - erary interest from many and unique sources , and illustrated by numberless artistic repro - ductions of drawings either unpublished hith - erto or wholly inaccessible to the general public , is one of the few real treasures of the autumn publishing season .

		Those who have long loved
Kate Greenaway	PERSON	and her quaint conceptions of childhood will take pleasure in so distinguished a study of her life and work , and will find much interesting new material to add to their own memories .

		And on the other hand , that much larger circle who regard Miss
Greenaway	PERSON	vaguely as a bygone illustrator of children 's books which set a passing fashion for big hats , mitts , muffs , and short-waisted , long -
$ ^	MONEY	rted dresses , and who know nothing definite about her private life , -- this great majority will be pleasantly surprised at the revelations of the new biography .

		Even now , as the writers admit .

		Miss GreenawaVs stand - ing as an artist is disputed .

		` As Mr.
Lionel Robinson	PERSON	asked at the time -LSB- of her death -RSB- -- did she found a school or did she only start a fashion ?

		Was hers but a passing ad captan - dum popularity or does her art contain the true elements of immortality ? '

		However time may answer these questions , it is certain that an art and a personality which could interest
Ruskin	PERSON	and draw from him unstinted praise and many a vigorous scolding -LRB- more good - tempered than
Ruskin	PERSON	's scoldings were at all given to being -RRB- and could win for themselves besides a host of friends like the Locker-Lamp - sons , the du Mauriers , Mr.
Austin Dobson	PERSON	, the Tennysons , and the
Arthur Severns	PERSON	, -- that an art and a personality so environed will be capa - ble of interesting biograpliical treatment .

		438 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, of proportion , which assigns to each item its proper space in a volume that has not a dull page or a bit of superfluous ' padding / Apart from her work , they justly consider the great feature of
Kate Greenaway	PERSON	's life to have been her friendship with
Ruskin	PERSON	.

		They have been very fortunate in securing from
Ruskin	PERSON	's literary executors generous permission to make copious extracts from
Ruskin	PERSON	's side of the cor - respondence that went on vigorously between him and '
K. G	PERSON	/ for many years , until owing to
Euskin	ORGANIZATION	's failing health it finally ended as a wonderfully sustained and spirited mono - logue by '
K. G.	PERSON	' alone .

		These letters , hitherto unpublished , constitute the unique feature of the text , though it must not be rashly assumed that the narrative or the rest of Miss Green - awa3 ^ s correspondence are lacking in vivacity or in the atmosphere that enables the reader to realize the delightful personality behind the commonplace and unobtrusive exterior that its owner sometimes bemoaned .

		Much of the material in the chapters entitled ' Early Years ' was obtained from the rough draught of an unfinished autobiography of Miss
Greenaway	PERSON	's childhood .

		Owing to their discursiveness and lack of literary form , these reminiscences have been generally reproduced in the third person .

		To them is due in large measure the vivacity of this portion of the narrative .

		An interesting side-issue is the careful account of the part - nership between Miss
Greenaway	PERSON	and Mr.
Edmund Evans	PERSON	, to whose expert color-printing by means of wood blocks was due a measure of her wonderful success .

		The revolution she achieved in one form of book-illustration would have been impossible without Mr.
Evans	PERSON	's help .

		Nor are Miss
Greenaway	PERSON	's verses neg - lected .

		These are often referred to incidentally , and a final chapter sums up the matter much after the judgment of Mr.
Austin Dobson	PERSON	, who declared , ` She was very deficient in technique , but she had the root of the matter in her . '

		As for the illustrations , they are all unique .

		Nothing is reproduced from
Kate Greenaway	PERSON	's regularly published books , and it seems as if no pains had been spared to collect ajl the per - sonal and elusive drawings , whether • mere sketches or elaborate oil portraits , which are treasured by her brother , and her friends and patrons , and by their generosity here first reproduced .

		The end-papers are facsimiles in miniature from the nursery wall paper printed with
Kate Greenaway	PERSON	^ s special permission by the owner of the original drawing .

		Pen and pencil sketches that appeared on letters to Euskin or Miss
Dickinson	PERSON	form chapter head - ings or black-and-white inserts .

		Sometimes a whole letter , with its drawing , is reproduced in facsimile , and several of
Euskin	ORGANIZATION	's letters are shown in the same form .

		The color-prints , exquisite exsimples of the best results to be obtained by the modern three-color process , reproduce water-color drawings in the posses - sion of friends such as Mr.
Stuart M. Samuel	PERSON	, whose treasures include a dainty ' procession ' of girls bearing flowers , originally sent to
Euskin	PERSON	upon his birthday , and less elaborate but often beautifully finished drawings which
Kate Greenaway	PERSON	was wont to inclose in letters to Mrs.
Arthur Severn	PERSON	, and to present to other friends as the best thanks within her power for kindnesses rendered her .

		Particularly interesting are facsimiles of two pages from a tiny MS. bibelot entitled ' ^ Babies and
Blos	PERSON	- soms , ' drawn by
Kate Greenaway	PERSON	and written by
Frederick Locker-Lampson	PERSON	as a surprise for his wife , and an original four-page story writ - ten and illustrated by Miss
Greenaway	PERSON	for Mrs.
Severn	PERSON	's daughter Violet .

		Euskin and
Kate Greenaway	PERSON	did not meet until
1882	DATE	, but his first letter to her , composed in a delightfully fantastic vein , was written in
December of 1879	DATE	, probably at the suggestion of her good friend and sincere though kindly critic , Mr.
H. Stacy Marks	PERSON	.

		At that time
Miss Greenaway	PERSON	was already famous .

		Her Christ - mas cards and her illustrations ranked with or above
Walter Crane	PERSON	's and
Caldecott	ORGANIZATION	's ; she had been admired , imitated , caricatured in ' Punch , ' and pirated in
Germany	LOCATION	and
Belgium	LOCATION	. '

		The Birthday Book ' had been issued and had prompted
Stevenson	PERSON	to try his hand at verses for children ; and French and English critics had vied with one another in admiration for the unaffected beauty , delicate humor , and exquisite technique of the drawings in ' Under the Window . '

		Euskin had had much to say of her feeling for children , and had hesitated for some time , wishing to write to her but fearing to write harmfully , before he finally ventured to address her .

		The punctuation in these quotations , as in all the letters , follows
Euskin	PERSON	's curious custom of substituting dashes of various lengths for commas , semicolons , and colons .

		He writes : ' My dear
Miss Greenaway	LOCATION	-- I lay awake half -LRB- no a quarter -RRB- of
last night	TIME	thinking of the hundred things I want to say to you -- and never shall get said !

		-- and I 'm giddy and weary -- and now ca n't even say half or a quarter of one out of the hun - dred .

		They 're about you -- and your gifts -- and your graces -- and your fancies -- ■ and your -- yes -- perhaps one or two little tiny faults ... Well , of the thousand things -- it was nearer a thou - sand than a hundred -- this is anyhow the first : Will you please tell me whether you can only draw these things out of your head -- or could if you chose , draw them with the necessary modifications from nature ?

		For instance -- ' And he goes on to explain that he has seen many farm-houses down in Kent and twenty children in his parish school that are lovelier than any in Kate 's book .

		Only the children

		and when you do , do you like it ?

		* No. 5 .

		Is a witch 's ride on a broomstick the only chivalry you think it desirable to remind the glorious

		` No. 11 .

		Did you ever see
Chartres Cathedralf	ORGANIZATION	And so on to No. 15 : * WiU you please forgive me -- and tell me -- some of those things I 've asked ? '

		Miss
Greenaway	PERSON	responded promptly to this comprehensive catechism , and
Ruskin	PERSON	wrote again , urging her to study nature .

		A year later he goes into raptures over the first orig - inal drawing of hers that he has seen .

		` The drawing is so boundlessly more beautiful than the wood-cut ... These books are lovely things but , as far as I can guess , from looking at this drawing , your proper work would be in glass painting -- where your own touch , your own polor , would be safe for ever , -- seen , in sacred places , by multitudes -- copied by others , for story books -- but your whole strength put in pure first perfect - ness on the enduring material .

		Have you ever thought of this ? '

		There is something almost grotesque in the idea of
Ruskin	LOCATION	, painstaking student of nature in her every least manifestation , exercising his critical faculty in perfect seriousness upon ` K. G. 's ' fairy-like conceptions .

		It suggests inevitably a picture of an elephant trying vainly to comprehend and to correct the careless Sittings of a gay butterfly .

		The fact that neither
Ruskin	PERSON	nor Miss
Greenaway	PERSON	seemed to be conscious of any such incongruity shows more clearly perhaps than any other one thing how seriously
Kate Greenaway	PERSON	was accepted and how highly valued by those who best under - stood her ideals and methods .

		Some of
Ruskin	ORGANIZATION	's detailed criticism is very picturesque and amusing .

		In
June , 1883	DATE	, he writes : ` Now be a good girl and draw some flowers that wo n't look as if their leaves had been in curlpapers all night -- and some more chairs than one chair -- with the shade all right and the legs all square -- and then I 'll tell you what you must do next . '

		Again on the loth , from Oxford : ' I do want some children as they are , -- and that you should be able to draw a pretty one without mittens , and that you should be more interested in phases of character .

		I want your exquisite feelings given to teach -- not merely to amuse ... I 'm going to do a bit of `` Kate '' glass directly , for some English hall in fairyland .

		-LSB- He had already had at least one such window made . -RSB-

		You 'll soon have proof of the lecture on you ! '

		He is forever complaining of the children 's feet .

		* I wish some of the children had bare feet and that the shoes of the others were n't quite so like mussel-shells , ' he writes once . '

		Butter boots ' is another of hL apt compari - sons .

		Soon after he complains that ` the feet are getting too small , ' adding , ' I want you to go to Boulogne and take a course of fish-wives and wading children . '

		Another bete noir of
Ruskin	PERSON	's is the big
Greenaway	PERSON	hats .

		He insists that they are merely easy substitutes for the back-grounds that she can not draw .

		He growls about her conventionalized landscapes , declares that he is ashamed of her ' Language of Flowers , ' and then , relenting a little , packs off some ` sods ' for her to paint , ' not to tease you -- but they 'll go on growing and being pleasant companions . '

		She promptly paints one , and he sends off an ecstatic telegrEim : ' The sod is quite lovely , the best bit of groundwork I ever got done , so many thanks , but do n't tire yourself so again . '

		Unfortunately
Ruskin	PERSON	seldom preserved let - ters , and none of Miss
Greenaway	PERSON	's to him are extant until the years came when he ceased to keep up his side of the correspondence .

		But it is clear that she must have displayed a good deal of tact in managing her bearish critic .

		He never got really angry , never lost his inter - est in her work , which he often refers to in such terms as ` lovely , beyond all thanks or believeableness or oonceiveableness . '

		And
Kate	PERSON	, for her part , went her own way , profiting by his excellent advice and very grateful for his interest , but quite unhampered by his ` tyran - nies , ' as he himself once at least called them , and taking pains never to let him see a book until it was safely printed .

		It was not that he did not admire the virtues of her work , but he wanted it to have all the virtues .

		In one of his last letters to her , writ - ten from
Sandgate	LOCATION	, he shows how he values her peculiar gift of imagination .

		` You can not conceive how in my present state I envy -- that is to say -- only in the strongest way , long for -- the least vestige of imagination , such as yours .

		When nothing shows itself to me -- all day long -- but the dull room or the wild sea and I think what it must be to you to have far sight into dreamlands of truth -- and to be able to see such scenes of the most exquisite grace and
Ufa	LOCATION	and quaint vivacity -- whether you draw them or not , what a blessing to have them there -- at your call .

		And then I stopped and have been lying back in my chair the
last quarter	DATE	of an hour , -- thinking -- If I could only let you feel for only a quarter of an hour what it is to have no imagination -- no power of calling up lovely things -- no guidance of pencil point along the visionary line .

		Oh , how thankful you would be to find your mind again . '

		And what lovely work you have spent -- where no one will ever see it but poor me -- on the lightest of your messages ... Well , I had joy out of them -- such as you meant -- and more than ever I could tell vou . '

		440 THE DIAJL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, It is a pity that space is lacking to quote from the occasional letters in which Euskin speaks more fully of himself -- of his battles at Oxford with atheistic scientists and careless students , of his greater battle with himself and the gathering shadows , of the flowers he loves best and the novels he detests most , of his autobiography that is going to be ' so dull ' and ` so meek , ' of the reasons why clouds float , of the weather , without and within .

		Kate 's letters to him , in spite of the difficulty under which she wrote , without the inspiration of answers , are charming -- always sympa - thetic , always cheerful , ` newsy , ' and character - istic .

		Writing from
London	LOCATION	to the recluse at Brantwood she naturally speaks often of the art exhibits she attends .

		Her favorite adjec - tive for the very modem painters is ' funny , ' and generally she writes it all in capitals .

		It is this quality of artless frankness in her letters , their ingenuous merriment , their abandoned joy in the beauty of the earth , rather than their literary finish , that gives them charm .

		As the years go on there are hints of depres - sion , of a feeling that she is being superseded and ' forgotten ' in spite of all her efforts .

		But this is not dwelt upon .

		The impression left by the biography is of a personality at once gay and serious ; of a life spent in hard endeavor towards high ends , and reaping great reward in achievement , in friendship , and in the pop - ular favor which measures achievement ; of a career rounded and closed before it has grown burdensome .

		The
Rescue of Religion	ORGANIZATION	.

		* A few years ago , Mr.
W. H. Mallock	PERSON	gave us ' Eeligion as a Credible Doctrine . '

		This work , notwithstanding the title , was mainly devoted to the pulverization of the religious apologists ; but nevertheless , it presented at the end cogent reasons for still maintaining the general religious position .

		The same author 's new book now before us is , as it were , a new edition of the old , with the proportions altered .

		It would not be truly Mallockian if it did not hold up for exhibition the weaknesses of pre - vious writers , and indeed it does this through - out ; but it does much more , it seeks to present the fundamental axioms of religion in such a way that they can be accepted , -- not in spite of , but rather because of , modern scientific knowledge .

		Passing over the introduction , which contains some curiously poor verses , we find a closely-reasoned argument continued from the first page to the last , with little pause ♦
The Reconstruction of Religious Belief	ORGANIZATION	.

		for breath .

		It is a book to be read at a single sitting , like a good novel .

		To say that it is interesting , well written , and appropriate to the times , is to offer it the merest justice ; but to describe it as a complete success is perhaps going too far .

		Perhaps it would be more suc - cessful if it were less complete .

		Belief , it is observed , is necessary to our con - tinued existence .

		Daily and hourly -- from minute to minute -- we act in accordance with our beliefs .

		These beliefs are founded , we com - monly say , on experience ; but when we attempt their logical analysis we sooner or later find ourselves confronted by absurd contradictions .

		` If the conception of freedom eludes and baffles the intellect , so in their last analysis do our con - ceptions of everything .

		As
Spencer	PERSON	has shown , we can not , without self-contradiction , conceive space , or matter , or motion , or causation , or our own con - scious existence .

		Our consciousness is always a con - sciousness of the present moment ; but the present moment is an ever disappearing point , which has gone before we can name it -- which holds all , and yet is nothing ... Matter has three dimen - sions , yet resolves itself into points with none .

		Nothing can be thought of as not having a cause ; yet all causes end at last in an Absolute which can cause nothing ; and if we look on this Absolute as an absolute yet personal God , God , asi Dean
Mansel	PERSON	shows us , is all the unthinkables in one ' -LRB- p. 272 -RRB- .

		Hence the religious difficulty is , at heart , the same as the scientific difficulty , and all we can say about it is , that it appears to be insoluble by the human intellect .

		Are we , then to hold ourselves lost ?

		By no means ; for just as in the ordinary affairs of life we depend upon the practical beliefs we have reached , so in higher matters must we rest upon the verities of religion , for the sake of our own sanity and the progress of civiliza - tion .

		What are these higher matters , and what are the verities of religion ?

		Logic does not tell us ; science , as a logical system , knows no higher or lower , better or worse .

		Yet , as we live , we may not , can not , abandon our system of values , or admit that good and bad , higher and lower , beauty and ugliness , are one and the same thing .

		If the cosmos has no soul , if we ourselves are but bubbles formed in an instant and bursting in the next , if all we do , think , or say was predetermined in infinity , the very meaning of the higher life is lost .

		Man has tediously climbed the ladder of evolution , until at length he seems to see over the housetops the distant hills ; and is he now to be told that they are a figment of his imagination ?

		He will not be so stultified , logic or no logic .

		Granting so much , do we therefore grant anything and everything ?

		The sublime noto - riously borders on the ridiculous , and when the other day I heard an orthodox clergyman gravely maintain that God had a throne set up in a certain part of the heavens , I could

		THE DTAT .

		441 only suppose > n 'm to be wanting in a sense of humor .

		The truth of the matter is , that it will not do to confuse the ultimate illogicality of things , as they necessarily appear to our minds , with a system of thought which for everyday practical purposes will not work .

		We believe in the freedom of the will , within limitations , as a practical necessity ; but to hold at the same time some of the traditions of theology and the theories of science , or even the opinions result - ing from common experience , is like caging together two furious beasts , which can by no means endure one another .

		As 0 .


W. Holmes	PERSON	said , the scandalous thing is not that such combinations make people insane , but that people profess to hold by them and retain their sanity .

		But the religious apologist will say , that is true ; but turn out the scientific beast , not the religious one !

		^ Vhy can not we do that ?

		Ulti - mately for the practical reason that the scien - tific animal will and does serve us in a thousand ways , and is always ready to come at our call ; while the other is shy and cantankerous , to say the least .

		If we were monomaniacs , it might be different .

		Here is the whole point of Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	's contention .

		The religious beast has got to go ; there is no reasonable doubt about that ; but must religion go with it ?

		If it must , the end of human progress , as we understand it , has come ; but it must not , and moreover , can not , in the nature of things .

		The clergy are too wedded to old traditions , and too ignorant of science , to afford much help ; the scientific are for the most part too narrow ; and hence the inevitable new birth is not an easy one , and the transition period is one in which men seem cast adrift .

		The very psychological conditions which made the coming of Christ so opportune
1900 years ago	DATE	, have arisen again .

		I have not attempted to reconstruct Mr.
Malloclrs	PERSON	argument in this short review , but merely to describe his general purpose .

		Neither has it seemed worth while to offer detailed criticism , though * science / as understood by many , is likely to repudiate such things as the inheritance of sense-impressions described on p. 37 .

		There remains , however , a more funda - mental objection .

		Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	says : ` We must , then , recognize anthropomorphism , un - derstood with certain limitations , as providing us with what is not only not an illegitimate , but the sole scientific means , of approaching the problem of the ultimate character of the universe .

		Just now we compared the
Unknowable First Cause	ORGANIZATION	, as
Haeckel	ORGANIZATION	,
Spencer	PERSON	, and their whole school represent it , to a seemingly blank slab which when cleaned by a further application of the methods of these thinkers themselves , is seen to be covered with in - numerable cryptic inscriptions ; and we asked whether it were possible to discover any Bosetta Stone -- any bilingual tablet -- by means of which we might be able to spell out a part of them ; and here we have our answer .

		The Bosetta Stone of the universe for ourselves is the human brain , in which matter and conscious mind are immediately presented to us as identical , and we are able to watch reality at work under its two aspects ' -LRB- p. 1 < 9 -RRB- .

		This attractive idea is developed at consid - erable length , with the result of apparently justifying , or at least rendering more or less probable , the existence of a cosmic God .

		The objection which may at once be raised to it is this : that the human mind can not be thought of as cosmic and omnipotent .

		Our very thought -- the emergence of cerebration into the field of consciousness -- depends upon the existence of active conflict , and upon the reac - tions between personality and non-personality .

		If the absence of free-will is untiunkable , so equally is unrestrained free-will : it is like the conception of pushing with nothing to push .

		The human mind or personality , magnified into a cosmic
Grod	PERSON	, would be exactly the blank slab which
Haeckel	PERSON	and
Spencer	PERSON	are said to have depicted , and while the conception might have value in philosophic discussions , it could have nothing whatever to do with religion .

		^ Monotheism carried to its logical extreme is Pantheism , and possesses no reality which the human intellect can grasp .

		The reaUy religious man cries ` My God , ' and while he may postu - late an omnipotent and cosmic deity , in reality he addresses himself to his spiritual father or friend , who is thought of as one like himself only immensely superior .

		Philosophically , it is perfectly reasonable to hold that each man 's individual God is a phase or aspect of spiritual totality , just as each man 's garden is a phase or aspect of material totality ; but for the pur - poses of living religion , each must have his own special deity , who ministers in special ways to his needs .

		Thus some of the creeds of paganism are seen to be more genuinely alive and purposeful than we have been wont to assume , and polytheism is no longer a word of reproach , but a reasonable projection of the diverse aspirations of mankind .

		442 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, impression of the general influences of the sub - ject chosen for study .

		In her latest volume , a critical interpretation of the novels of Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	, she has found a theme well suited to her powers of insight and illumination .

		In an introductory chapter various questions are raised regarding the influence of Mr.
James	PERSON	upon his readers , -- such as whether or not their minds are enriched by his fiction , and whether his work tends to quicken the vision and grasp of beauty in art , in character , and in the external world .

		From the first we are assured that to Miss
Gary	PERSON	, as to all admiring readers of Mr.
James	PERSON	, the answers to such queries must be strongly affirmative .

		Tracing his early work , with ii ^ ' promise of triumph over the common - place , ^ following his years of ripening amid Eng - lish and
Continental	ORGANIZATION	influences , emphasizing his French mode of style with its ` rich density of detail , ' Miss
Gary	PERSON	reaches her first general asser - tion of Mr.
James	PERSON	's highest ideal as critic and novelist alike , -- to combine ' what a critic of painting would call tactile values with the greatest amount of spiritual truth . '

		In the second chapter , on * American Ghar - acter , ' one finds an excellent review of Mr.
James	PERSON	's attitude towards the salient and inci - dental qualities of Americans , from his first studies in ' Watch and
Ward	PERSON	' and '
Roderick Hudson	PERSON	' to * The Ambassadors . '

		Miss
Gary	PERSON	, like her subject , is constantly ' striking matches ' for our enlightenment on her theme , while , with keen phrase , she says that Mr.
James	PERSON	has written , not a Comedie Hummne but , in large measure , a
Comedie Sociah	ORGANIZATION	, dealing with the mental and social contacts of Americans and Europeans .

		With amusement , that is also echo , we read in the same chapter this sentence , bear - ing directly upon '
Roderick Hudson	PERSON	' but ap - plicable to much of the author 's character-delin - eation : ^ All through the book people explain themselves to each other and explain each other to themselves . '

		^ The Genius of Places , ' that intense feeling which Mr.
James	PERSON	shows for certain houses and surroundings , gives theme to another chapter , with special illustrations from ' The Portrait of a Lady . '

		A consideration of ' The Question of Wealth , ' interpreted from their attitude toward wealth of Mr.
James	PERSON	's characters , from
Isabel Archer	ORGANIZATION	and
Adam Verver	PERSON	to the stupid and gross spenders in ` The Spoils of
Poynton	LOCATION	, ' leads on to the con - clusion that ' appreciation of the two kinds and uses of wealth , the material and the immaterial , -- this , perhaps , is the marked characteristic of his representation of society in which the '' pic - ture and the idea '' are present in such even proportion . '

		Under the elastic title of ' Imag - ination ' are introduced anew queries regarding the universal truth and the real expressiveness of the novelist 's characters .

		Recognizing that the conscious appreciation of such women as
Maisie	LOCATION	,
Nanda	LOCATION	,
Maggie	PERSON	, and
Maria Gostrey	ORGANIZATION	must come slowly .

		Miss
Gary	PERSON	justly lays stress upon the staying quality of their images when once they are impressed .

		With discrimination she points out that Mr.
James	PERSON	does not dissect his characters , but rather he builds them up syn - thetically and slowly , to gain large effects .

		Of her author 's symbolism and swift psychological images she says , with personal zest : ' From the point of view of one who likes it , such an exer - cise of the imagination brings back the delicious early sense of living in a fairy-tale , but without the sacrifice of our later sense of reality .

		We gain from it both the show of things and their significance , both the fable and the moral , both the text and the picture . '

		If there is weakness anywhere in this interest - ing and luminous * study it is in the chapter on * Philosophy . '

		One wishes that more expansion of Mr.
James	PERSON	's moral and psychologic messages had been included .

		With happy metaphor the author speaks of the difficulties in the way of such study -- ' It is easy , no doubt , in a wood so closely set with handsome growth , to see only the trees . '

		Questioning if Mr.
James	PERSON	has fol - lowed his own ideals as set forth in ` The Art of Fiction , ' Miss
Gary	PERSON	finds in him a judicial mind and a constant presentation of some moral or intellectual problem , frequently a problem of choice .

		An exhaustive bibliography by Mr.
Frederick Allen King	PERSON	, arranged logically as well as chronologically , is a valuable adjunct to the chapters by Miss
Gary	PERSON	.

		II .

		One of the most elaborate , as well as one of the most authoritative , art books of the season is Mr.
Gustave Geffrey	PERSON	's aecount of ' The Na - tional Gallery ' of
London	LOCATION	, published by
Messrs. Frederick Warne & Co.	ORGANIZATION	in a volume copiously illustrated with over fifty full-page photogra - vures and nearly three times as many pictures in the text .

		An introduction by Sir
Walter Arm	PERSON	- strong , director of the
Irish National Gallery	ORGANIZATION	and an illuminating critic , traces briefly but com - prehensively the history of the
English National Gallery	ORGANIZATION	from its foundation in
1824	DATE	to the pres - ent time .

		The terse but scholarly method of the introduction is followed in the rest of the book .

		Mr.
Geffroy	PERSON	writes in succession of each of the seven great schools of painting represented in the
Gallery	ORGANIZATION	, treating in separate articles certain eminent groups of painters or , in a few cases , an individual artist .

		A special point is made of the origins of each school and of its development from one phase to another , so that each division
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAli 443 of the book is unified through much detail .

		Mr.
Geffroy	PERSON	's criticism is descriptive and aesthetic , as well as historical , and occasionally biographi - cal , when biographical data are essential to the interpretation and understanding of any paint - ing .

		His style is often brilliant , and always clear and definite .

		The book is not primarily a history of isolated schools ; it is an account and a comparative estimate of those schools as they are represented in the English Gallery , and there is constant reference to the influence of all the groups upon the English painters .

		To the native school in its various characteristic manifestations one-third of the space available in the volume is allotted .

		In these days of splendid illustrating almost nothing is any longer astonishing , but it may safely be said that even today a more luxuriously and satisfactorily illustrated book would be hard to find .

		The more notable pictures , and those containing masses of detail , are reproduced in full-page size , and the smaller half-tones are very effect - ive for portraits and for some types of landscape .

		The volume , which is of quarto size , would make an excellent guide-book for visitors to the Gal - lery , but it seems to be planned more particu - larly for the leisurely study that comes before or between pilgrimages to
London	LOCATION	, and its scope and ample illustration , together with the great variety of types represented between its covers , make it an excellent volume with which to start one 's artistic training .

		If it be possible to say of a city , as it was said once of a woman , ` to have loved her is a liberal education , ' that city is
Florence	LOCATION	.

		A certain ex - travagance of language that would be out of place in writing of other cities is quite pardon - able when
Florence	LOCATION	is the theme .

		` Flower of all Cities and Cities of all Flowers ' is the char - acterization of Miss Lilian `` Whiting in her latest book , ` The Florence of Landor ' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- ; and whoever in the early
Spring	DATE	has climbed up the green slopes of
Fiesole	LOCATION	, or the opposite height of
San Miniato	LOCATION	, and looked down upon the marble town with its cupolas and roofs buried in a sea of blossoms , will appreciate the appellation .

		Though literary
Florence	LOCATION	is less well-known than artistic
Florence	LOCATION	, it is no less fascinating .

		Of the Anglo-Florentines who formed there such a brilliant literary group dur - ing the middle years of the nineteenth century , one of the earliest to come and longest to remain was
Walter Savage Landor	ORGANIZATION	.

		For this reason , and not because Landor was in any sense a per - sonal centre -LRB- his personal aflBliations were too limited for that -RRB- ,
Miss Whiting	LOCATION	uses ` The Flor - ence of Landor ' as a title to cover the more distinctively literary life of the city from
1821	DATE	, when
Landor	PERSON	came to
Florence	LOCATION	, to
1864	DATE	, when he died there .

		Certainly those were great days , and
Miss Whiting	ORGANIZATION	's book contains many happy pictures of the social life of this inner circle of choice spirits , -- ` moonlight gatherings on the ter - race of some old palazzo , where Italian politics and poetry were discussed over tea and straw - berries , or at chance encounters in galleries or churches where the conversational interludes of sympathetic companionship were resimaed . '

		There are so many good things in Miss Whit - ing 's book , that the pity is all the greater that the writer has never acquired the literary virtues of restraint and selection ; although in this vol - ume she offends less than usual , her pen too often runs away into merely ` fine ' writing , upon topics quite out of place .

		Then , too , before the book goes into another edition , the publishers should have the proofs read by some one familiar with Italian proper names .

		A number of excel - lent half-tone reproductions , mainly from photo - graphs of Florentine buildings and scenery , illustrate the volume . '

		With
Shelley	PERSON	in
Italy	LOCATION	, ' by Mrs.
Anna Benneson McMahan	PERSON	, is an illuminating commentary upon the Italian influences that made
Shelley	PERSON	, one bound to be a great poet in any environment , ' the particular kind of great poet that he is . '

		The book takes the form of an anthology of extracts from the poems , letters , and note-books written between
1818	DATE	and the poet 's death , with brief introductory comments by the editor upon the circumstances under which
Shelley	PERSON	lived and worked in each of the five short years that were left to him .

		The book is published by
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	in a sumptuous large-paper edition limited to two hundred and fifty copies .

		The binding is of grey boards , with gold decora - tions and vellum back .

		Nearly seventy-five pho - tographs , including some taken expressly for this book , are reproduced in tint , by way of recalling pictorially
Shelley	PERSON	's Italian environment .

		Mrs.
McMahan	PERSON	has made no addition to our already abundant supply of ` chatter about
Harriet	PERSON	' ; her interest in
Shelley	LOCATION	lies on quite another plane .

		In her general introduction she recalls Dr.
Richard Garnett	PERSON	's statement that the great obstacles to a general comprehension of the poet were ` his erudition and the Italian atmosphere which envel - ops much of his poetry . '

		In the twenty-five years since this comment was uttered , the erudition has been pretty thoroughly annotated , but Mrs.
McMahan	PERSON	's is the first attempt to set the poems in their original environment , by illustration , and by grouping them with apposite passages from the letters and note-books , ' so that the poems may be seen in the making , so to speak . '

		This is the compiler 's object , and she accomplishes it in a wav that leaves no need for further justification .

		Shelley 's note to his ` Ode to the West Wind ' gains new significance when it is printed below a photograph of the ` wood that skirts the Amo * to which it refers , and the Italian spirit of even so universal a bit of literature as the ' Ode ' comes suddenly to the fore in the reader 's enjoyment .

		Descriptive passages in other poems and the extracts from the dramas gain greatly in interest when read in connection with
Shelley	PERSON	's almost impassioned account of the experiences that brought them into being .

		Mrs.
McMahan	PERSON	's own writing fills less than a score of her pages , -- a fact testifying to her marked ability to speak briefly and to the point .

		Mr.
H. Noel Williams	PERSON	, who has written popular studies of Madame Recamier ,
Madame Du Barry	ORGANIZATION	, 444 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	,
Madame Pompadour	PERSON	, and other French wits , beauties , and ` queens of the left hand , ' has published a new volume along somewhat the same lines , entitled ` Queens of the Trench Stage ' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- .

		In this new work he discusses in turn
Madame Moliere	ORGANIZATION	;
Marie de Champmesle	PERSON	,
Racine	LOCATION	's interpreter and mistress ;
Adrienne Leeouvreur	PERSON	, whose romantic history and tragic death lend themselves easily to exploi - tation ; and several others of the artistic fore - bears of Mesdames
Bernhardt	PERSON	and Rejane .

		Mr.
Williams	PERSON	gives both the ` backstairs ' and the theatrical biography of his subjects .

		Having ap - parently delved deeply into contemporary rec - ords , he speaks with authority , citing sources in foot-notes , and sometimes assembling a rather tiresome array of proofs .

		Written in clear , vig - orous style , the book makes interesting , if not very stimulating reading .

		Its greatest value lies in the glimpses which it affords of late seven - teenth and early eighteenth century French soci - ety , and of the attitude of that society toward the actor .

		The picture is not a pleasant one , for the book resolves itself into the story of liaisons , jealousies , infidelities , intrigues , and scandals in high life and low .

		The history of triumphs and failures on the stage is subordinated to the more significant history of romances in the wings and the green-room ; and we are given unprofitable side-lights on those who deserve remembrance simply as artistic or historic personages .

		For those who played so brilliantly before the foot - lights often played at the game of life very badly , if one judges them by twentieth century and Anglo-Saxon standards .

		The book , a sub - stantial volume of some three hundred and fifty quarto pages , is pleasantly illustrated with eight or ten full-page half-tone reproductions after contemporary drawings or paintings .

		A photo - gravure from a famous portrait of Adrienne Le - eouvreur serves as frontispiece .

		Mr.
George Wharton James	PERSON	is an indefatigable exploiter of the romance of the great West , -- not the West of the gold rush , the gallant cow-boy , or the picturesquely adventurous prospector , but the West of the Indian , whether he be the present-day basket-maker , living peacefully on his reserva - tion , or the savage convert of the Spanish padres , whose crusade to
Alta California	LOCATION	began at about the time of our revolution and came to an end a dozen years before the territory 's annexation .

		It is this particular phase of his subject that engages Mr.
James	PERSON	's attention in his latest book , ` In and Out of the Old Missions ' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Finding this theme still too broad to be handled in one volume without undue condensa - tion , Mr.
James	PERSON	further limits it in his preface to
California	LOCATION	missions , promising a companion vol - ume upon those of
New Mexico	LOCATION	,
Arizona	LOCATION	,
Texas	LOCATION	, and
Lower California	LOCATION	.

		Full and beautiful illus - tration is always a feature of Mr ,
James	PERSON	's books .

		This new one contains over sixty pages which reproduce one hundred and forty-two photographs of Mission art and architecture , and of street scenes and Indian types to be found in
Mission	LOCATION	villages .

		For the bulk of his work Mr.
James	PERSON	claims no particular originality .

		The origin and development of the Missions , the noble deeds they enshrined , the good they did and tried to do for the Indian , have been already treated by experts , from whose works Mr.
James	PERSON	has supplemented the impressions gained by personal pilgrimages stretching over a period of twenty-five years .

		But certain points have never been presented , or presented so fully , before : for example , the origin and the detailed style of Mission architecture , and its influence upon modem architecture in the
United States	LOCATION	; the mural decorations , the wood - carving , the silver and brass ware , and the figures of saints , in the Missions ; and some others .

		A cursory survey of the book , which extends to nearly four hundred pages , finds it an interesting and adequate treatment of a fascinating theme .

		Similar in general style of make-up and also in intention -- that of pleasing the ` arm-chair ' traveller , without disregarding the needs of his fellow who journeys by road and rail -- are two books published by
Messrs. L. C. Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, entitled respectively ` Rambles in
Brittany	PERSON	' and ` Among French Inns . '

		The former is the fifth volume of French sketches which Mr.
Francis Miltoun	PERSON	has written .

		It is the informal record of many journeys and rambles , rather off the beaten track of tourist travel .

		Maps , plans , diagrams , and an index to places will be useful to all classes of readers .

		There are general chapters on the history , topography , and customs of the province , and detailed accounts of certain regions .

		A delightful feature of the volume is Mrs.
Blanche McManus	PERSON	's picturesque drawings of the country , the architectural monuments , and the people .

		These , reproduced in tint , with an ornamental cover of heavy buckram , give the book an attrac - tive holiday air .

		-- Mr.
Charles Gibson	PERSON	, author of ` Among French Inns , ' has a very unfortunate literary style .

		He defaces almost every page of his book by his badly chosen vocabulary or his disregard for the rules of English syntax .

		To quote only one sentence from a page which fur - nishes several examples , equally forcible , Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	says in describing the market-place at Caudebec : ` Here we hear the cackle of the hen , and observe the young calf elongate his soft , pink tongue in gentle endearment . '

		And so , though Mr ,
Gibson	PERSON	tells us a great many interesting things about
Normandy	LOCATION	, we can not feel that his text is worthy of the elaborate embellishment which is given it by over thirty tinted reproduc - tions of photographs , prettily designed end-pa - pers , and an alluring cover .

		In response to an urgent demand for more Uncle Remus stories , Mr.
Joel Chandler Harris	PERSON	has written ` Told by Uncle Remus ' -LRB-
McClure , Phillips & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a collection of new stories of negro folklore , which are permeated by the same sly humor that has given Uncle Remus his unique position among lovers of good stories .

		Brer Rabbit ,
Brer Fox	ORGANIZATION	,
Brer Wolf	PERSON	, and all the rest of the gay brotherhood reappear in the new book , and
Messrs. Frost	PERSON	,
Conde	LOCATION	, and
Verbeck	PERSON	have contributed pictures , in full-page size and also in little vignettes that are quite as eharae -

		THE DIAL .

		445 teristie .

		` The Reason Why ' is the name of the introductory story , which tells how Uncle Remus , after years of silence , happened to begin story-telling again .

		The reason is as ingenious and convincing as if an excuse for such a pro- ceeding was really needed .

		The stories explain such interesting matters as ` Why Mr.
Cricket	PERSON	Has Elbows on His Legs , ' ` How
Wiley	PERSON	Wolf Rode in the Bag , ' ` When Brother Rabbit Was King , ' ` Why Mr.
Dog	PERSON	is Lame , ' and many others .

		Uncle Remus has presumably aged somewhat since his first appearance , but his story-telling faculty is unimpaired by time and disuse .

		Between the diverting humor of Mr.
Oliver Herford	PERSON	's verses and the same humor in its pic - torial manifestations , it is hard to choose , partic - ularly since the two together make such a delightful haimony .

		In his new book , ' The Fairy Godmother-in-Law ' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , Mr.
Herford	PERSON	has made the illustrative features rather less promi - nent than usual .

		The little pen-and-ink drawings are characteristically clever and original , but the verses are the piece de rSsistance .

		The first story , which gives the book its title , is an engaging sequel to
Cinderella	LOCATION	.

		As Mr.
Herford	PERSON	puts the matter in the preface : ` It is not always well to place Unbounded Faith in
Fairy Lore	LOCATION	, Believing that in every case They all lived Happy ever more .

		` Stranger than Fiction though we deem The Truth , it does not follow , too .

		That Fairy Tales , because they seem Still stranger , must be still more true .

		` Far be it from me to assail The Truthfulness of Fairy Writ , But let us take a Well-known Tale , And see what really came of it . '

		Some of the other verses embody Mr.
Herford	PERSON	's corrections of myths and fairy tales ; and others , like ` The Bachelor Girl ' and ' A Modern Dia - logue , ' have no such basis .

		But all exhibit their author 's genius at maxiipulating rhyme , meter , and sense so as to carry out his humorous pur - poses .

		` The Travel Lover 's Library ' of
Messrs. L. C. Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	is augmented by a study of `
China	LOCATION	and her People ' edited from the work of the late Col.
Charles Denby	PERSON	, who was for the thirteen years following
1885	DATE	United States Minister at
Pekin	LOCATION	.

		Like the other numbers in the ` Travel Lover 's Library , ' this new work is in two handy - sized volumes .

		The first volume is filled with reminiscences of the author 's stay in
China	LOCATION	and his personal impressions of the land and the people , and with accounts of court life at
Pekin	LOCATION	and social life and customs elsewhere in the king - dom .

		The second volume is concerned with Chinese politics and industrial and commercial problems and conditions .

		The lucid statements of the causes of the Russo-Japanese war and of the arguments for the ` Open Door ' policy , the chapters on the
Boxer	PERSON	rebellion , the foreign missionaries , and the immigration question , are all of interest and some value , as coming from a man who was in a position to know the facts and therefore has a right to his theories about them .

		In general , the topics dealt with in both volumes are of the sort that would naturally interest a man of affairs , and
Colonel Denby	PERSON	's method of treating them will appeal particularly to masculine readers .

		In accordance with the plan of the series , the volimies are profusely illustrated with reproductions of photographs collected by the author .

		`
Normandy	LOCATION	in Colour ' -LRB- Dent-Dutton -RRB- , by Mr.
Gordon Home	PERSON	, is chiefly of interest for its beau - tiful colored plates , which give clearer impressions of Noi-many 's varied and wonderful scenery , her splendid churches and chateaux , her quaint and narrow streets , and her poplar-shaded country roads , than any words , however perfectly chosen , could hope to do .

		But Mr.
Home	PERSON	is sufiiciently an artist to write , as well as paint , like one .

		He wins the reader 's approbation by his first sen - tence . '

		Very large ants , magpies in every meadow , and coffee cups without handles , but of great girth , ' are the objects he seizes upon as par - ticularly indicative of the differences between
Normandy	LOCATION	and
Devonshire	ORGANIZATION	.

		The same feeling for effective detail permeates all Mr.
Home	PERSON	's pen pictures of
Normandy	LOCATION	.

		His method of treatment is purely impressionistic .

		He tells the reader what pleasures await him in
Normandy	LOCATION	, leaving to Baedeker the purveying of those hard facts about historical association and other like mat - ters which , however profitable to the traveller , are devoid of literary or artistic value .

		Mr.
Gustav Kobbe	PERSON	's ` Famous Actors and Act - resses and their Homes , ' first issued two years ago , re-appears in two handy-sized volumes , bound in red cloth and neatly boxed , as one of Messrs.
Little	PERSON	,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	's ` Holiday Art Sets . '

		These sketches are deservedly popular , for they combine dignity with interest , in a field where such a combination is rarely achieved .

		The thirty full-page plates and forty illustrations in the text , which belonged to the original edition , have been retained in the reprint .

		Devotees of the modern stage will be glad to have their Christ - mases remembered with a gift of these tasteful volumes .

		Mr.
Kobbe	PERSON	is at his best in writing of his contemporaries , whom he lets us know with an intimacy that never degenerates into vulgar gos - siping .

		But his new volume , ` The Loves of Great Composers ' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , may also be com - mended among works of its class .

		It details the romantic attachments of
Mozart	ORGANIZATION	,
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	,
Mendelssohn	ORGANIZATION	,
Chopin	ORGANIZATION	, the Schumanns ,
Liszt	ORGANIZATION	, and
Wagner	PERSON	, giving some new facts and correcting some familiar errors .

		The accounts are enter - taining , and the reader is grateful for their com - plete avoidance of sentimental rhapsodizing .

		The book is printed with rubricated headings and initials , and contains twenty-four full-page illus - trations in tint , reproducing portraits of the composers and the women they loved .

		Mr.
Harold MacGrath	PERSON	knows how to write stories whose plots , though they seem fantastic enough in the light of a subsequent cool consider - ation , are constructed with aji art that holds the reader 's interest from the first page to the last , -- 446 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, and makes him wish there was more to follow .

		Such a story was ` The Man on the Box ' and such another is ` Hearts and Masks ' -LRB-
Bobbs-Merrill Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The new book is published with photogra - vure illustrations by Mr.
Harrison Fisher	PERSON	and a dainty cover that give it the air of a holiday novelette ; but it is besides that a thoroughly good story .

		The hero and heroine are both of the adventurous , Bohemian type , who make excite - ment when it does not come ready-made .

		How they went to a masked ball , at which
New York	LOCATION	's prize detective and
New York	LOCATION	's mysterious gentle - man burglar also happened to be present , and to what purpose they passed their evening , should be left entirely to Mr.
MaeGrath	PERSON	's effective telling .

		Holiday gift-hunters who want a book that is at once pretty and entertaining need not go further than ` Hearts and Masks . '

		Admirers of Mr.
Harry Graham	PERSON	's ` Misrepre - sentative Men ' will be glad to hear that ` More Misrepresentative Men ' is now ready for their perusal .

		The patriotism of
William Waldorf Astor	PERSON	,
Henry the Eighth	ORGANIZATION	's ` passion for domestic life , '
Sherlock Holmes	PERSON	's ` placid , penetrating eyes , ' and other themes as pertinent are treated in verse , in Mr.
Graham	PERSON	's wittily merciless fash - ion .

		Mr.
Malcolm Strauss	PERSON	contributes carica - tures of the various ` misrepresentative men . '

		-- Another cleverly humorous booklet published by the same house -LRB- Fox ,
Duffield & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is ` The Fusser 's Book , ' which is issued in a new and larger edition this year .

		` Fussers ' of both sexes will find the rules of the game as laid down by the Misses
Anna Archbald	PERSON	and
Georgina Jones	PERSON	extremely useful and adapted to all pos - sible and impossible cases ; and they are so cleverly stated that they can more easily be re - membered than forgotten .

		Appropriate pic - tures and cover design by
Miss Florence Wjinan	ORGANIZATION	add the finishing touch to a book that will amuse both ` fussers ' and those who would like to have the word ` fusser ' defined .

		In his new book called ` Romances of
Old France	ORGANIZATION	' -LRB-
Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Mr.
Richard Le Gallienne	PERSON	re-tells half a dozen more tales of media -RRB- val devotion , very similar in spirit to those that made up his previous volume of ` Old Love Stories Retold . '

		` Amis and
Amile	PERSON	' and ` Aucas - sin and
Nicolete	ORGANIZATION	' will be familiar to most read - ers , at least in outline ; but they are charming enough to stand repetition .

		` The Tale of King Coustans the Emperor ' and ` King Floras and the Fair Jehane ' have already been re-discovered and modernized by
William Morris	PERSON	, from whose versions Mr.
Le Gallienne	PERSON	quotes at length .

		The other two stories he seems to have brought straight from the original text .

		Mr. Le Gal - lienne 's style is graceful , piquant , and spirited `` Without being archaic ; and he tells as much of the stories as most readers will care to hear .

		The volume is daintily bound in gray boards , with the picture of a knight just leaving his castle vignetted into the front cover .

		A frontis - piece and occasional border vignettes placed in the generous margins comprise the other decora - tive features .

		` In
Bohemia	LOCATION	' is the title of a uniquely bound and prettily decorated booklet containing a med - ley of verse and prose sketches by Mr.
James Clarence Harvey	PERSON	.

		The author tells the unin - itiated how to go to
Bohemia	LOCATION	and what they may reasonably expect to find there , making a special point of the distinction between the false and the true Bohemianism , whether it is found in
New York	LOCATION	or
Damascus	LOCATION	.

		Some of the verse in dialect is very clever .

		-- Similar in general make - up , but more original in content , is ` The Log of the Water Wagon ; or , The Cruise of the Good Ship `` Lithia . '' '

		Messrs.
Bert Leston Taylor	PERSON	and
W. C. Gibson	PERSON	are responsible for the text , and Mr.
L. M. Glackens	PERSON	for the pictures and decorations .

		The dedication is ` To all surviving passengers of the good ship `` Lithia , '' ' and the editor 's note explains how the log was compiled from memoranda ` found in a floating milk-bottle with a patent stopper , flung overboard just before the good ship ` Lithia ' foundered in a fearful simoon ... The notes , penciled in a trembling hand , on the backs of blank temperance pledges , I U 's , and wine lists , were barely legible . '

		The itinerary of the ship , its rules and regulations , and sundry moral reflections upon life , liberty , and the pursuit of iappiness are added to the log , which makes very .

		amusing reading .

		Both of these booklets are published in attractive form by the
H. M. Caldwell Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Messrs.
Dana Estes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish , in uniform style and binding , two volumes of compilations entitled respectively , ` The Art Lovers '
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	' and ` The Music Lovers '
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	. '

		The former , which is edited by
Carrie Thompson Lowell	PERSON	, is characterized on the title-page as ' famous pictures described in poems . '

		Forty-eight pictures are reproduced in half-tone , and the editor writes a running comment , treating a group of paintings and sculpture under some general heading , such as ` Mythology in Poetry and Sculpture , ' ` Legends of the Saints , ' or ` Pictures translated into Verse . '

		References to the pictures in poetry , and apposite quotations which have suggested themselves to the author in connection with some painting , are reproduced as occasion occurs .

		Pictures and poetry are thoroughly representative , and the arrangement , though necessarily loose , holds the reader 's interest .

		-- ` The Music Lovers '
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	, ' edited by
Helen Philbrook Patten	PERSON	, is an antholo - gy of poetry , ancient and modern , referring to musical themes .

		There is plenty of variety , both in authorship , subject , and literary merit , the aim being apparently to appeal to music lovers rather than to over-critical literary connoisseurs .

		Half-tones of some twenty-five pictures having musical subjects furnish illustrations for a vol - ume that certainly merits its title .

		A delightful illustrated edition of ` The Fables of
Aesop	ORGANIZATION	' is published by Messrs.
Moffat	PERSON	,
Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The ` Fables ' are adapted from the Rev.
George F. Townsend	PERSON	's translation of the Greek .

		An introduction is furnished by
Elisabeth Luther Cary	PERSON	, who writes charmingly of the ap - peal of the fable to the thoughtful and the simple alike , of the authorship of the Aesopian
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 447 group , the variant classical forms and the French adaptations , and of the illustrations which have been made for the work in various generations .

		The present edition is illustrated by Mr.
J. M. Conde	PERSON	, whose pictures in color and line certainly catch something of the spirit of the text , if they also miss something more .

		At least they are pictoiially attractive and interest - ing , and will take their place with other intelli - gent essays at picturing the lurking , whimsical humor of the Greek fabulist .

		To the long list of their finely illustrated ` Photogravure Series ' of books of travel , the
John C. Winston Co.	ORGANIZATION	have added a timely work upon
Russia	LOCATION	.

		The text is not new , being a re - production , in translation , of
Theophile Gautier	PERSON	's graceful interpretation of his Russian joumey - ings , first published in
1866	DATE	.

		The translation by
Miss Florence Mclntyre Tyson	ORGANIZATION	, prepared espje - cially for this edition , is mechanical , but on the whole fairly satisfactory .

		Miss Tj ` son also con - tributes a final chapter entitled ` Russian Policy in the
East	LOCATION	, ' which brings the volume up to date in the only respect upon which
Russia	LOCATION	's policy has changed materially between
1866	DATE	and the signing of the peace protocol , a few months ago .

		Gautier 's narrative needs no conmient ; it touches authoritatively upon
Russia	LOCATION	's history and government , her art , her politics , her army and
navy	ORGANIZATION	, her homes , her public buildings , and her amusements .

		The present work is published in two volumes , handsomely bound in red and gold , provided with cloth cover slips and boxed .

		Fifty fine photogravures , from photographs of public buildings , streets , monuments , and quaint peasant customs , illustrate the volumes .

		In `
Shakespeare 's Sweetheart	ORGANIZATION	, ' Miss
Sara Hawks Sterling	PERSON	has made an interesting essay at a romantic interpretation of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's courtship of
Anne Hathaway	PERSON	.

		The traditional account of the matter is relegated to the back - ground of the story , and
Anne	PERSON	is made the poet 's real sweetheart and true love , only temporarily supplanted by the fascinating wiles of the Dark Lady .

		The story is told by
Anne Hathaway	PERSON	her - self , who consents , at the solicitation of
Ben Jon	PERSON	- son , to set down for posterity an account of her husband 's private life .

		The narrative has a de - cided dramatic quality , though from the very magnitude of the undertaking there are inevi - table crudities and faults in both style and atmos - phere .

		But on the whole the situation is han - dled skilfully , and the story is a charming bit of imaginative writing .

		The book is published by
Messrs. George `` W. Jacobs & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, in an orna - mental buckram binding , with colored chapter and running heads and five striking illustrations by
Miss Clara Elsene Peck	ORGANIZATION	.

		Miss Esther
Singleton	PERSON	's series of compilations on artistic and historical themes are justly pop - ular , for they give the reader who seeks infor - mation clear and definite statements enunciated by unquestioned authorities .

		The latest volume which Miss
Singleton	PERSON	has edited and in part translated is entitled ` Great Portraits , as seen and described by great writers ' -LRB-

		The term ` great writers ' is elasticaUy in - terpreted to mean competent art critics .

		The portraits are chosen with reference to their fame and merit , and also with a view to illustrating as many different ideals of portraiture and kinds of technique as possible .

		Each picture is shown in an excellent half-tone , which is followed by one or two descriptive and critical articles .

		Por - traits treated in
Miss Singleton	LOCATION	's ' Great Pictures ' or ` Famous Paintings ' are omitted here .

		Mr.
John Luther Long	PERSON	has turned from the flowery land of `
Madame Butterfly	ORGANIZATION	' and ` Miss
Cherry Blossom of Tokio	ORGANIZATION	' to write ' a little com - edy of country manners ' in
German-Pennsylvania	LOCATION	.

		It is named after its hero ' Seffy , ' which is short for
Sephenijah Baumgartner	ORGANIZATION	.

		When the story opens Seffy is , as his name suggests , rather a spiritless hero .

		In love as in other matters he is * f astnaehiek , ' which is
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	Dutch for ` chust about a quarter of an inch too late for the prize . '

		But Seffy learns wisdom -- and speed -- before the end of the story .

		Old
Baum	PERSON	- gartner , the father , is a delightful country-store philosopher , and it is about him rather than
Seffy	PERSON	that the interest centres .

		The novelette is orna - mentally bound , and supplied with marg ^ al borders and colored illustrations attractive enough to catch the eye of holiday shopj -RRB- ers .

		-LRB-
Bobbs	ORGANIZATION	-
Merrill Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- ` My Lady 's Slipper ' is the title of a pretty holiday novelette , printed with tinted illustra - tions and unique border designs .

		Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers , and Mr.
Cyrus Townsend Brady	PERSON	the author .

		The latter assures us that though Doctor
Franklin	PERSON	and Commodore
Paul Jones	PERSON	, not to mention the
King	ORGANIZATION	and Queen of
France	LOCATION	, are among its characters , nevertheless the book is not an historical novel .

		` There is no history in it unless it be another version of a thing that has happened since the beginning of time and which is therefore a part of all history -- the love story . '

		Master
Francis Burnham	PERSON	is the American hero of this dainty Parisian romance , and the heroine is a French countess .

		The story of their love affairs is a pretty trifle , well adapted to its ornate setting .

		A new edition of Mr.
Kenyon	PERSON	Cox 's collected essays in art criticism , entitled ` Old Masters and New , ' is published in a handsome volume , with one illustration of the work of each painter or school discussed , by
Messrs. Fox , Duffield & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Cox	PERSON	's essays well deserve any added advantage that pictures can give them .

		In these days of machine-made criticism his work appeals strongly to discriminating readers who can ap - preciate the combined authority and charm with which he is qualified to speak , and the masterly fashion in which , sweeping aside unessential matters , he pierces straight to the core of his subject , somewhat after the manner of
Walter Pater	PERSON	.

		The painters of whom he writes are aU peculiarly suited to his somewhat esoteric meth - od .

		In its new dress , therefore , and with its score of excellent half-tones , the book should find a wider public than ever .

		448 THE DTATi -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, In spite of the very obvious purpose of in - troducing dramatic masterpieces to young read - ers with which Charles and
Mary Lamb	PERSON	wrote the ' Tales from
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, ' some of us still cherish our thumbed copies , refusing to yield up all rights in them to the younger generation .

		Such persons will appreciate the new edition lately imported by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons , -- a beautifully bound and printed quarto with colored illustrations by Mr.
Norman M. Price	PERSON	.

		Portraits of Charles and
Mary Lamb	PERSON	, re - drawn in sepia from the originals in the
National Gallery	ORGANIZATION	, stand side by side as the frontispiece .

		Each tale is provided with one illustration , some - times rather too highly colored , but always imaginative and truly interpretative after a fashion that ought to please readers of all ages .

		` Eve 's Daughters , ' compiled by ' A Mere Man ' and portrayed by Mr.
A. G. Learned	PERSON	, is a very miscellaneous collection of epigrams about women , published by
Messrs , Dana Estes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		in a volume daintily bound in gold and white and lavishly decorated in a humorous style matching the gently satiric tone of the text .

		The quota - tions are not grouped in any logical way , and the volume belongs to the large class of pretty and amusing gift-books which are intended not for systematic reading , but for pleasant com - panionship in an idle hour .

		The decorations are of indifferent quality , but the epigrams are all clever , and the ` Mere Man ' has shown a good deal of ingenuity in etilling from serious philos - ophers and bantering humorists alike something that suits his purpose .

		The numerous quota - tions from French authors give the tone to the collection .

		The new Scribner edition of
Stevenson	PERSON	's ` Child 's Garden of Verses ' with illustrations by
Miss Jessie Willcox Smith	PERSON	, is meant , no doubt , for the children , but it is so pretty that older readers will be inclined to dispute their exclusive right to it .

		The book is of quarto size , with a , glimpse of a garden on the cover , and a design made up from garden scenes on the end-papers .

		The colored title page is particularly dainty , with its stalks of tall yellow hollyhocks .

		Each verse has an illustrative heading or tail-piece , conceived in the quaint spirit of the text .

		Besides these black - and-white drawings , there are a dozen full-page plates in colors , picturing with much charm and suggestiveness certain favorite bits of
Steven	PERSON	- son 's verse .

		A pretty idyl entitled ` Back to Arcady ' -LRB- Tur - ner -RRB- comes from the pen of Mr.
Frank Waller Allen	PERSON	.

		It is a tender , graceful little love-story , quaintly told by a third person -- a charming old man .

		He mingles memories of his own long - buried romance , garden thoughts , and out-door fancies , with his account of the new romance that is growing up between his beautiful young ward and his talented young protege .

		The course of true love does not run quite smoothly for a time , but in the end it comes out as is to be expected of love in
Arcady	LOCATION	.

		The illustrations are sepia reproductions of dainty pen-and-ink draw - ings .

		Figured end-papers and border designs ; on alternate pages give the volume a pleasing holiday appearance .

		` The Spalding Year Book , ' compiled by Miss
Minnie R. Cowan	PERSON	, is a selection , from the writ - ings of Bishop
Spalding	PERSON	, of brief quotations for every day in the year .

		The volume is pub - lished in
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's ` Helpful Thoughts Series . '

		It is tastefully bound in red cloth , with a portrait frontispiece , and makes a pretty and an inspiring gift-book .

		-- Another very attractive year-book from the same publishers is a new series of ' Catch Words of Cheer , ' compiled by Mrs.
Sara A. Hubbard	PERSON	.

		A quotation attrib - uted to
Stevenson	PERSON	, ` Man does not live by bread alone , but also by catch words , ' is set on the title-page , and aptly typifies the character of the book , which is an excellent combination of high seriousness and enlivening humor .

		There are border decorations for every page , and the binding is unique and pretty .

		` Old Fashioned Flowers ' is the title essay in a delightful little volume of nature sketches by
Maurice Maeterlinck	PERSON	.

		Half a dozen studies of flowers in colors by Mr.
Charles B. Falls	PERSON	, and attractive type , paper , and binding lend to the small volume an air of distinction which matches the unusual quality of
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	's style .

		Flowers , like animals , have distinct perspnalities for
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	, but his frequent personifica - tions are aesthetically justified by the real feeling that they express .

		The essays have already appeared in various magazines , but discriminating lovers of flowers will like to have them brought together in this pretty booklet .

		-LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- ` The Heart of Lady
Anne	PERSON	' is the title of a new novel by
Agnes	PERSON	and
Egerton Castle	ORGANIZATION	, which the
Frederick A. Stokes Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish in a prettily illustrated edition .

		The incomparable Kitty of ` The Bath Comedy ' figures again in this story of married love , whose hero and heroine are a chivalrous but iron-willed English squire and his girl-wife , half French in blood and all French by training .

		Miss
Ethel Franklin Betts	PERSON	has painted the lovers , catching the spirit both of the times and of the story in her pictures ; and Mr.
Frederick G. Hall	PERSON	has provided decorations in color which lend an air of festivity to this dainty bit of eighteenth century romancing .

		Two holiday issues from the Messrs.
Appleton	PERSON	show excellent mechanical features and may be read with pleasure , -- though they fall short of the ideal illustrated edition , chiefly because of the inherent difficulty presented by their material .

		Sir
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	's ` Seats of the Mighty ' is too large and dramatic a panorama to be susceptible of the ordinary sort of illustration .

		The eight tinted pictures , which , with decorated end-papers and ornate binding , make up the holiday features of the present edition , represent as many dra - matic moments in the story .

		But the artist 's con - ception of the situation is ineffective compared with the author 's , and his figures are very wooden , so that the pictures add little , if anything , to the reader 's pleasure .

		A similar criticism must be passed upon the illustrations for Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's
1905	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DTATi 449 ` The Seven Seas . '

		Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's verse at its best is so gfraphie that a fairly good illustration seems by comparison unbearably conmionplace .

		The present drawings , while varying greatly in merit , never reach anywhere near to the imaginative , mystical depths of the verse .

		The colored page - borders , however , furnish suggestive and suitable frames for the text , and the cover design is good .

		Xo stories are more appropriate or more popular for holiday reprints than
Dickens	PERSON	's * Christmas Books , ' as a coimtless variety of editions attests .

		But more than passing interest attaches to the new Dent-Dutton edition of three of the stories , published with illustrations in black-and-white and in color by Mr.
C. E. Brock	PERSON	.

		* Tbis artist touches nothing that he does not adorn , -- chiefly , no doubt , because he knows his sphere so well .

		Dickens 's work comes well within it , and Mr.
Brock	PERSON	's pictorial interpretations of ` The Chimes , ' ' A
Christmas Carol	PERSON	, ' and ` The Cricket on the Hearth ' are thoroughly delightful .

		There are seven colored plates and a few more small pen - and-ink drawings in each of the three volumes .

		One of the most artistic of the season 's less pretentious holiday publications is Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's edition of
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's ` Maud , ' with illustrations by Miss
Helen Maitland	PERSON	Arm - strong and conventional floral page-borders , a series of very original and suggestive symbolic headings for the twenty-eight parts of the poem , and a beautiful cover design by
Miss Margaret Armstrong	ORGANIZATION	.

		The page illustrations , which are printed in soft colors on tinted paper , catch the over-refined , mystical note of the text perfectly , and the book as a whole is a harmonious and beautiful production .

		The charming `
Miss Cherry Blossom of Tokio	ORGANIZATION	' appears in a gay new dress this year , to tempt holiday buyers afresh with her delicious ` pigin ' English , her light-hearted mirth , and her touch - ing devotion .

		The cover of the new edition is of cream buckram , prettily ornamented .

		The border designs are Japanese in effect , and are printed in half a dozen different color-combina - tions , so that there is plenty of variety .

		Most of the illustrations are from photographs , but a few are reproductions of Japanese work .

		Mr.
John Luther Long	PERSON	contributes a new preface , in which he and the great god Asamra talk enter - tainingly about the trials , responsibilities , and little vanities of authors .

		-LRB- Lippincott . -RRB-

		A new edition of Dr.
Henry van Dyke	PERSON	's ` Fisherman 's Luck , ' made from new plates and illustrated by Mr.
F. Walter Taylor	PERSON	, has been issued by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		It is quite unnecessary to dilate upon the charm of these delightful essays , which have already been reprinted a dozen times .

		In general form the new edition follows the standard editions of Dr. van Dyke 's other books .

		The pictures , if not particularly interpretative , are at least good enough to be unobjectionable .

		` The Beatitudes Calendar , ' designed by Mr.
R. Anning Bell	PERSON	, is larger and more elaborately ornamented than Mr.
Alfred Bartlett	PERSON	's calendars are wont to be .

		Five sheets , printed in black and white , each contain a pictorial treatment of one of the beatitudes , with border designs for picture and calendar .

		The effect suggests the old wood-cuts , in its boldness and simplicity of design ; and it is doubtful if anything more artistic may be found among the season 's calen - dars .

		A very appropriate Christmas remembrance for a friend is the little booklet by Dr.
Henry van Dyke	PERSON	, entitled ` The Spirit of Christmas ' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		It is daintily bound and well printed , with a photogravure frontis - piece by way of ornament .

		It contains a ` Dream Story , ' a Christmas essay , a Cbristmas sermon -LRB- very short -RRB- , and two beautiful Christ - mas prayers , one for the home and one ` for lonely folk . '

		* A Chronicle of Christmas ' is the title of a bookful of Christmas misceUany , written or selected by
Miss Jeannette Grace Watson	ORGANIZATION	.

		There are Christmas hymns and poems , Christmas stories , and brief accounts of Christmas customs in many lands .

		There is even a recipe for the Christmas plum pudding .

		Floral borders and a holly-wreathed cover make appropriate decora - tions .

		A second and revised edition of ` The Oyster , ' by Professor
William K. Brooks	PERSON	, is published at the
Johns Hopkins Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		The only notabJe addi - tion is that of a section upon the peculiar fitness of the oyster to become an agent in the propa - gation of germ diseases .

		An admirable addition to the admirable series of ` English Keadings ' published by

Dec. 16	DATE	, Three important books to be issued immediately by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are
` American Trades Unionism	ORGANIZATION	/ a volume of papers by post - graduate students of
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	, edited by Professors
Hollander	PERSON	and
Barnett	PERSON	; ` The Negro and
the Nation	ORGANIZATION	, ' by Mr.
George S. Merriam	PERSON	, originally published in the
Springfield	LOCATION	` Eepublican ' ; and
` Nature and Health	ORGANIZATION	, ' a book of popular hygiene by Dr.
Edward Curtis	PERSON	of
New York	LOCATION	. '

		A Satire Anthology ' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is the contri - bution made this year by Miss
Carolyn Wells	PERSON	to holiday literature .

		Beginning with the ancients -LRB-
Aristophanes	ORGANIZATION	,
Horace	PERSON	, and Juvenal -RRB- , who are represented for the purpose of completing the record , the selections work down to such very modern exemplars of the species as Mr.
Owen Seaman	PERSON	and Mr.
Gelett Burgess	PERSON	.

		Sprinkled through the list of authors we note such out-of-the-way names as those of Buteboeuf ,
Abraham 3	PERSON	,
Sancta Clara	LOCATION	,
Villon	PERSON	, and
Beranger	PERSON	.

		The collection is , however , mainly one of English verse , from the Elizabethans on , and may safely be depended upon to provide both amusement and instruction .

		A few sets of the publications of the Biblio - graphical Society of
Chicago	LOCATION	, which terminated its existence upon the organization of a national so - ciety in
1904	DATE	, may now be ordered from the
Sec	ORGANIZATION	- retary of the
Chicago	LOCATION	Chapter of the Society .

		These publications , valuable in themselves , are indispensable to a complete history of the Biblio - graphical Society of
America	LOCATION	, since the former
Chicago	LOCATION	society was the direct predecessor of the national organization .

		The set includes the three annual Yearbooks , containing the proceedings and papers of the society for
1900-3	DATE	; a reprint of Au - gustus De
Morgan	ORGANIZATION	's ` On the
Difficulty of Correct Description of Books	ORGANIZATION	' ; and Mr.
A. G. S. Joseph	PERSON	- son 's list of ' Bibliographies of Bibliographies , ' chronologically arranged , with occasional notes and an index .

		A ` Manuscript Edition ' of the complete writ - ings of Henry
David Thoreau	PERSON	, handsomely illus - trated with one hundred photogravures from na - ture , is announced by
Messrs. Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The edition will consist of twenty vol - umes , limited to 600 signed and numbered sets , each containing a page of original manuscript .

		The last fourteen volumes will contain
Thoreau	PERSON	's Journal , edited by Mr.
Bradford Torrey	PERSON	, the lar - ger proportion of which is material that has never before been published .

		The illustrations are from photographs by Mr.
Herbert W. Gleason	PERSON	, who has made a careful study of
Thoreau	ORGANIZATION	's writings and has explored with equal thoroughness the woods and fields about
Thoreau	PERSON	's home .

		The edition is printed in the best style of the
Eiverside Press	ORGANIZATION	, and a few sets will be bound in handsome leather with water color frontispieces .

		Mr.
Alleyne	PERSON
Ireland	LOCATION	's important and exhaustive ` Report on
Colonial Administration	ORGANIZATION	in the
Far East	LOCATION	' is announced to begin publication shortly , with the imprint of
Messrs. Small	ORGANIZATION	,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The entire report will extend to ten or twelve volumes , the first of which is about to appear .

		Mr.
Ireland	PERSON	's study of comparative col - onization has extended over a period of fifteen years , during which time he has visited not only the countries included in his forthcoming report , but
South America	LOCATION	,
Australia	LOCATION	, the
West Indies	LOCATION	, and others as well .

		His report will treat of every form of dependent government now in force in any part of the tropical world .

		It will deal not only at length with such questions as
Colonial Civil Service	ORGANIZATION	, Taxation , the
Administration of Justice	ORGANIZATION	, Public Works , Irrigation , Municipal Gov - ernment , Labor Supply , Chinese Immigration , Po - lice and Prisons , and
General Colonial Legisla	ORGANIZATION	- tion , but will present a detailed account of the commerce , trade , shipping , natural resources , and climate of each dependency .

		Statistical and bibli - ographical data , as well as the laws now in force in regard to contract labor , municipal govern - ment , and civil service for each dependency , will be given .

		` The
Atlantic	LOCATION	Monthly ' offers a varied and interesting programme for the coming year .

		Among the more important features may be noted a series of critical essays on the work of prom - inent living writers , among others
Henrik Ibsen	PERSON	,
Edith Wharton	PERSON	, and
Anatole France	LOCATION	; a series of articles dealing with the learned professions , writ - ten by prominent members of those professions , and including a discussion of ` The Ideal Physi - cian ' by Dr.
William Osier	PERSON	, and of ' The Ideal Min - ister ' by Dr.
Charles Cuthbert Hall	PERSON	; several au - thoritative papers on the theatre by such writers as
James L. Metcalfe	PERSON	,
Eichard Mansfield	PERSON	, and
John Corbin	PERSON	; articles on important financial and social subjects , by prominent writers in those fields ; some new letters of
Charles Lamb	LOCATION	, re - cently discovered by Mr.
W. C. Hazlitt	PERSON	; and the usual variety of brilliant literary essays , short stories , and poems , for which ` The
Atlantic	LOCATION	' is unsurpassed among current periodicals .

		A few children 's books received too late to be included in the list of juvenalia printed in The Dial 's issue of
December 1	DATE	, nevertheless de - serve some sort of mention .

		` Tales from
Dickens	PERSON	' , issued by
Bobbs-Merrill Co.	ORGANIZATION	is a volume of brief relations of episodes in fifteen of
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	's novels , told by
Haliie Erminie Eives	ORGANIZATION	in a style that children can understand and enjoy .

		Mr.
Reginald Birch	PERSON	furnishes some illustrations that appreciably soften the conventional caricature of the old - time Dickens illustrators Two beautiful impor - tations of Messrs. E ,
P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are ` Una and the Bed Cross Knight and Other Tales from
Spenser 's Faery Queene	ORGANIZATION	, ' retold in modem prose by Mr.
N. G. Eoyde-Smith	PERSON	and beautifully illus - trated by Mr.
T. N. Eobinson	PERSON	, and an illustrated `
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	' with pictures in line and color by Mr.
J. Ayton Symington	PERSON	.

		While the books are similar in general style of make-up , they differ greatly in artistic merit .

		The former is well written , and illustrated in an imaginative style that will interest old and young readers equally .

		The latter , while its illustrations are very perfunctory , is an attractive reprint in other respects , and boys will enjoy re-reading their old favorite in its new dress .

		-- ' The Story of the Three Dolls ' -LRB-
Bobbs-Merrill Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is written by
Jose	PERSON	- phine
Scribner Gates	PERSON	for the little readers who have liked her other doll stories .

		Unusually spirited illustrations , showing the dolls and the children who played with them , have been drawn for the book by
Miss Virginia	LOCATION	Keep A book of modern fairy tales written by Miss
Irene Maunder	PERSON	and called ` The Plain Princess , and Other Stories , ' comes from the press of Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		In a preface which he contributes to the volume , Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	assures timid children that there is nothing frightful in this book , and he advises little boys who do n't care for any fairy tales to paint the pictures .

		It is to be hoped that only little boys who can paint ex - tremely well will follow this advice , for the pic - tures , by
M. W. Taylor	PERSON	and
M. D. Baxter	PERSON	, are much too pretty to be spoiled .
