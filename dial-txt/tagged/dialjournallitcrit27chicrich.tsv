		27 THE
CHICAGO	LOCATION	SCHOOLS .

		There has been much discussion during the past month , voiced chiefly in the newspapers and in the meetings of various bodies interested in public education , of what has been somewhat sensationally termed a '' crisis '' in the school affairs of
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		An agitation of sentiment against the present management of the city educational system has been so sedulously stim - ulated by the busybodies that the resulting state of things may indeed be called serious , although not exactly in the sense intended by those who have brought it to pass .

		For a con - dition is certainly serious which makes it pos - sible that the unworthy influences which suc - ceeded , a few months ago , in defeating for the time being the important reforms proposed by the
Chicago Educational Commission	ORGANIZATION	, should command any considerable following in such an attack as has just been made upon the policy of Superintendent
Andrews	PERSON	.

		This attack has proceeded from motives so obviously preju - diced , and has been so utterly lacking in the elements of fairness and generosity , that we feel half-ashamed to dignify it by serious con - sideration .

		Perhaps it would be better to dis - miss it with some such phrase as that used by
Schopenhauer	PERSON	, speaking of the metamorphosis of serious thought when transferred to '' the narrow lodging and low roofing of the confined , contracted , thick-walled skull from which dull glances steal directed to personal ends . ''

		On the whole , however , it seems desirable to say something more than this , because preju - dices are active forces in the social organi - zation , and because interested activities are sometimes successful in disguising themselves under the garb of the fairest philanthropy .

		It is not easy to disengage from the tangled skein of rumor and recrimination the thread of any coherent argument , and the more one examines the charges brought against the present policy of school administration , the more bewildered one becomes at the infusion of personal feeling and the confusion of thought .

		As far , however , as any argument is discernible , it seems to be directed against two of the aims of Superin - tendent
Andrews	PERSON	that of establishing a sys - tem of true executive control and responsibility , 10 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, and that of raising the standard of efficiency and intellectual ability among the body of instructors and administrative officers .

		It would seem that a Superintendent who kept these aims in view should deserve and receive the heartiest support from all sections of the community .

		For the past score of years these aims have been set , by all the organs of serious educational opinion , foremost among those that should be worked for in the betterment of public school education .

		They have become the merest commonplaces of educational dis - cussion , and it is rather late in the day to be called upon to defend them anew .

		But such is the distorting power of prejudice over the simplest and clearest ideas , that the guarded an - nunciation of these aims by the present school administration has evoked an attack of the most violent nature , in which the plain promises of the Superintendent have been ignored , his motives impugned , and even -LRB- as in the case of the shameless resolutions of the
Chicago Feder	ORGANIZATION	- ation of Labor -RRB- his personal character aspersed .

		An attack of this sort is sure in the end to defeat itself , but it is a sorry exhibition for the time being , and it calls for an indignant re - monstrance from all the friends of fair play .

		To take the first of the aims above men - tioned , the consensus of opinion to the effect that both power and responsibility should be centralized in the executive head of a city school system is such that the official who stands for this principle is backed by wellnigh all the educational authority worth taking into ac - count .

		This principle was properly made the foundation of the recommendations of the Chi - cago
Educational Commission	ORGANIZATION	, and has been energetically maintained by Superintendent
Andrews	PERSON	during the year of his incumbency .

		Those who have opposed it have brought no arguments to bear against it , but have sup - ported their contention by a plentiful use of invective , and of the catchwords that the dem - agogic spirit has ever at hand for these emer - gencies .

		Such words as `` autocracy , '' * 4 tyr - anny , '' and despotism '' have been freely used , and the magic word '' democracy '' has once more been worked into the service of the reac - tionary party .

		In the sense in which the phrase '' democratic management '' has been employed in this controversy , it seems to con - note a government of the schools by the meth - ods of the town-meeting , if not of the mob .

		Questions of educational policy should be de - cided by councils and committees instead of by a responsible officer , so that no individual shall be much to blame if a decision turns out unfor - tunately .

		No more vicious absurdity than this was ever put forward in the name of democ - racy , or sought to be engrafted upon a system of .

		schools .

		Its practical workings have recently appeared in the antics of certain of the teach - ers ' organizations of
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		The methods of these bodies have resembled those of the trade union or the political caucus rather than those of the professional organization , and the situation they have been striving to create is one that would be simply intolerable were it to prevail .

		The second of the major aims put forward by the
Educational Commission	ORGANIZATION	and the Super - intendent is that of securing a higher average of educational qualification than heretofore for the teachers and other officers of the schools .

		Now , the obvious way of doing this is to set a standard of some sort , and , since the large ma - jority of educated people get the beginnings of their culture in some institution of the higher learning , it is quite proper to require of candi - dates for positions such an education or its equivalent .

		What goes by the name of a '' col - lege education '' means very little in very many cases , but it at least affords a starting-point for a test .

		We think , however , that the willing - ness to accept an '' equivalent '' has not been sufficiently emphasized in the present case , and much irritation might have been avoided had the declaration been made without reserve that unquestionable intellectual equipment , however obtained , should be enough to qualify for any post whatsoever in the system .

		Hard-and-fast rules are to be avoided in such matters .

		We have only to reflect that a
John Stuart Mill	PERSON	would be excluded from teaching by the '' col - lege education '' requirement , to realize the unwisdom of a too specific statement of quali - fications .

		This , however , is an aside , and does not touch the point mainly at issue , which is that of enlisting the highest obtainable scholarship in the work of teaching .

		The attempt to cripple Superintendent Andrews in this endeavor has been characterized by the use of the memor - able phrase '' educational trust , '' and by a line of reasoning which is not parodied in the fol - lowing statement : President
Harper	PERSON	of the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	was a member of the
Commission	ORGANIZATION	which urged the need of higher qualifications for teachers .

		Superintendent
Andrews	PERSON	was one of his old-time friends , and was brought to
Chicago	LOCATION	through his influence .

		These two then conspired to convert the public
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL ll school system of
Chicago	LOCATION	into an appendix to the
University	ORGANIZATION	, and at the same time devised a sinister scheme whereby all the desirable posts in the city system were to be manned by grad - uates of the
University	ORGANIZATION	.

		The conspirators were , moreover , being used as tools in a far-reaching plan of the '' plutocracy '' to get possession of the machinery of public education in the
United States	LOCATION	, in order that free discussion might be suppressed and the clutch of organized capital strengthened about the throats of the toiling masses .

		This , we repeat , is not parody , but the clearest exposition we know how to make of the theory of the '' educational trust '' as it has been set forth of late in connection with educational affairs in
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		False and even grotesque as they are , these charges , with others of like sort , and all that they imply , have been made seriously in the public press , and have influ - enced the opinions of thousands of unthinking people .

		We are inclined to believe that this monstrous explanation of what is , after all , the simple matter of an effort to elevate the stand - ard of the teaching profession in
Chicago	LOCATION	is nothing more than an inflated defence of what '' The Educational Review '' describes as '' the detestable theory that one purpose of the pub - lic schools is to provide young women with ` places ' in which to earn a livelihood . ''

		To such a complexion is reduced , when we look the facts squarely in the face , all this pother about '' discrimination '' and the substitution of '' monarchical '' for '' democratic '' ideals .

		To the intelligent mind , of course , these wild and whirling words are simply amusing , and the tissue of actual fact about which they cling the merest cobweb obstruction of vision .

		The last thing in the world that capital is trying to do is to control the machinery of education .

		It is too busily occupied in its own work of self - protection to be concerned with so extraneous a matter .

		The
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	has no other interest in the city school system than that of stimulating it to a more healthful activ - ity .

		And there is nothing in the course of Superintendent Andrews to indicate that he has any other object at heart than that of strength - ening the system under his charge by the application to its work of the most enlightened ideas and the recruiting of the most efficient co-laborers in this great service .

		He has been less than a year at his difficult task , and it is not yet time to demand results .

		But in the course of that year he has at least shown to all who have eyes to see , and who are in a position to take a disinterested view of his position , that he has his work earnestly at heart , and that he deserves from the whole community that cor - dial support with which the best elements of the community -LRB- including those that viewed his original appointment with some apprehension -RRB- have already expressed their recognition of the strength and the sincerity of his purpose .

		PL A YS AND PLAYERS OF A SEASON .

		Continuing our annual midsummer survey of the drama in
Chicago	LOCATION	, * we find that the season of 1898-99 has not passed without leaving for our theatre-goers the memory of several noteworthy events .

		Those autocrats of the stage who live in
New York	LOCATION	and dominate theatrical affairs the country over , have seen fit to deny
Chicago	LOCATION	audi - ences the enjoyment of some of the novelties under their control , while at the same time two or three of the sensations with which they have afflicted us could much better have been spared ; and yet there has been no lack in standard attractions , excellent in quality and generally worthy of the patronage ac - corded them .

		Early in the season Mr.
Gillette	PERSON	's ever-popular melodrama , ' b Secret Service , '' began a run of five weeks at
Powers	ORGANIZATION	's Theatre , closing with the end of
October	DATE	.

		During this same month Mrs.
Julia Mar	PERSON	- lowe-Taber was seen at the
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	for two weeks in '' The Countess Valeska , '' while Mdme .

		Modjeska appeared for three weeks at the
Grand Opera House	ORGANIZATION	in '' Canaille , '' ''
Magda	PERSON	, '' ''
Mary Stuart	PERSON	, '' and Shakespearian roles .

		Mr.
Goodwin	PERSON	and
Miss Elliott	PERSON	were at
Powers	ORGANIZATION	's throughout
November	DATE	, presenting ''
Nathan Hale	PERSON	, '' though not continuously , during the month 's engagement .

		Mrs.
Fiske	PERSON	came to the Grand for two weeks in
November	DATE	, where she was seen in ''
Tess	PERSON	of the D'Urbervilles '' and '' Love Will Find a Way . ''

		The great novelty of the year was Mr.
Mansfield	PERSON	's elaborate and finely artistic production of
Rostand	PERSON	's '' Cyrano de Bergerac , '' which won phenomenal success , holding the stage at the
Grand Opera House	ORGANIZATION	for five weeks ,
Decem	PERSON	- ber 4 to
January 7	DATE	.

		For three weeks in
December	DATE	and
January	DATE	, Mr.
Sothern	PERSON	was at
Powers	ORGANIZATION	's Theatre in '' The King 's Musketeer , '' and in the latter part of
January	DATE	Mr.
Hackett	PERSON	played a week 's engage - ment at the
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	in the dramatization of
Anthony Hope	PERSON	's '' Rupert of Hentzau . ''

		The last two weeks of
February	DATE	brought
Miss Nethersole	LOCATION	to
Powers	ORGANIZATION	's where she appeared in `` The Second Mrs. Tanqueray , '' '' The Termagant , '' `` Car - men , '' and '' Canaille . ''

		She was followed by Miss
Maude Adams	PERSON	in the dramatized version of Barrie 's '' The Little Minister '' next to Mr.
Mansfield	PERSON	's '' Cyrano '' the most popular attraction of the year .

		Miss
Adams	PERSON	's engagement continued six weeks ; then followed the presentation of ''
Catherine	PERSON	, '' with * See THE DIAL ,

		The month of

Julia Arthur	PERSON	's interpretation of `` Juliet . ''

		In
May	DATE	, Mr.
Frohman	PERSON	's Lyceum Theatre Company began at
Powers	ORGANIZATION	's an important engagement of four weeks , their most important production being last season 's
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	success -LRB- new this year in
Chicago	LOCATION	-RRB- , Mr.
Pinero	PERSON	's pleasing comedy , `` Trelawny of the Wells . ''

		Daring this month also Mr.
Otis Skinner	PERSON	came to the Grand for a week in the old favorite , '' Rose - mary . ''

		During the
first week of June	DATE	occurred the much advertised production of ''
Romeo	PERSON	and
Juliet	PERSON	, '' at
Powers	ORGANIZATION	's Theatre , with its expensive cast includ - ing
Miss Adams	PERSON	, Mr.
Faversham	PERSON	, and Mr.
Hackett	PERSON	.

		A new play by
Augustus Thomas	PERSON	, ''
Arizona	LOCATION	, '' began on
June 12	DATE	, at the Grand , a run of indefinite length .

		This constitutes a rather notable list of attractions for the year just closing , more comfortably dis - tributed too than always happens .

		It should be mentioned also that during the season engagements have been played by a number of steady standbys , including Mr.
Roland Reed	PERSON	, Mr.
Sol Smith Russell	PERSON	, Mr.
William Crane	PERSON	, Mr.
Stuart Robson	PERSON	, Mr.
Digby Bell	PERSON	, and
Miss May Irwin	PERSON	, although the plays presented by these people were none of them sat - isfactory , while some proved most unfortunate fail - ures .

		One of the features of the season has been the series of popular successes at
McVicker	ORGANIZATION	's Theatre , now under the management of Mr.
Jacob Litt	PERSON	.

		The most important of these productions were ''
Shen	PERSON	- andoah , '' which ran for three weeks in
November	DATE	; ' The Prisoner of Zenda , '' which followed for two weeks ; '' At
Piney Ridge	ORGANIZATION	, '' one week ; '' In Old Kentucky , '' two weeks ; and an elaborate staging of a new melodrama , '' Sporting Life , '' which was played to crowded houses for twelve weeks ,
Febru	PERSON	- ary 19 to
May 13	DATE	.

		At the minor theatres , nothing noteworthy has occurred .

		Conventional melodrama has held the boards , with occasional allowances of farce-comedy .

		The Academy ,
Adelphi	LOCATION	,
Alhambra	LOCATION	, and Lincoln opened in
August	DATE	with plays appropriately reflecting the national situation . ''

		The Commodore '' showed the gun-deck of a cruiser in action , special attention being called to the four-inch guns , very properly introduced thus to the realm of realistic drama . ''

		For Liberty and Love '' made good use of flash - light signals sent from a tower under fire of Spanish sharpshooters .

		Mr.
Lincoln J. Carter	PERSON	's '' Remem - ber the
Maine	LOCATION	'' was one of the new productions .

		``
Cuba	LOCATION	's Vow '' and `` Heroes of ' 98 '' celebrated generally the recent war .

		As matter of fact , ex - cepting these , very few war-plays have been put upon the local stage , and only occasionally has a play like ''
Chattanooga	LOCATION	, '' '' Held by the Enemy , '' or ' > The Girl I Left Behind Me '' made its appeal to the military spirit of the multitude .

		One popu - lar melodrama , '' Devil 's
Island	LOCATION	, '' has utilized the very natural material of the
Dreyfus	ORGANIZATION	affair .

		In the presentation of Shakespearian plays , the falling off from the record of previous years is startling , although some of the causes are not far to seek .

		Mr.
Thomas Keene	PERSON	and Miss
Margaret Mather	PERSON	are no longer living .

		Mr.
Mansfield	PERSON	has been sufficiently employed upon his splendid pro- duction of Cyrano '' ; Mrs.
Marlowe-Taber	PERSON	has been busy with experiments in modern drama ; Miss Rehan and Mr.
Walker Whiteside	PERSON	we have not seen .

		Mr.
Warde	PERSON	and Mr.
James	PERSON	, and Mr.
Otis Skinner	PERSON	as well , have found it safer not to attempt '' revivals '' which prove too costly for many successive seasons .

		Who is left ?

		In reality , there is but one , so far as we at present are aware ; and but for the somewhat erratic course of two stellar bodies of lesser magni - tude ,
Mdme	LOCATION	.

		Modjeska has ruled , solitary , queen of the tragic stage .

		During the season of 1895-96 , thirteen of the Shakespearian plays were presented in
Chicago	LOCATION	; the number of performances was eighty-eight .

		In 1896-97 also , thirteen plays were given , sixty-eight performances in all .

		In 1897-98 , ten were staged and the performances numbered fifty .

		The pale-green poplars shimmer in the sun , And wave and rustle ; the dry grasses sway ; The oaks and eucalyptus far away Take up a moaning music one by one .

		THE DIAL 13 NATURE-BOOKS FOR SUMMER OUTIXGS .

		* Popular interest in the subject of natural history must be on the increase , if the number and variety of recent books devoted to this subject can be taken as an index .

		Indeed , the introduction of nature-study in the grades of the public schools , and the growing attention paid to technical instruction in biology in our best high schools , must in time create and con - tinue a legitimate popular demand for trust - worthy and well-presented information on nat - ural history subjects by those who pursue these lines of study not as a vocation but as an avo - cation .

		Whatever the hobby be birds or butterflies , flowers or ferns the enthusiastic amateur may be sure of finding some helpful and reliable manual to stimulate his interest and guide his efforts .

		One of the most successful and attractive of these recent handbooks for nature study is Mrs.
Frances Theodora Parsons	PERSON	's '' How to Know the Ferns . ''

		From cover to index the book is tastefully and skilfully gotten up , and will prove to be a useful and satisfactory guide for those who go a-ferniug .

		An introductory chap - ter on ferns as a hobby is followed by a discus - sion of the seasons and situations in which ferns may be found , a brief illustrated explanation of the technical terms employed , and an account of the interesting life-cycle of the fern .

		The greater part of the book is taken up with the descriptions of the fifty-seven species found in the eastern
United States	LOCATION	.

		This is accom - plished with a minimum of technicalities and a * How TO KNOW THE FERNS .

		A Guide to the Names , Haunts , and Habits of our Common Ferns .

		maximum of fern lore and facts of biological interest .

		The illustrations are abundant and well executed .

		The work can not fail to prove a most enticing introduction to these shy inhab - itants of our woods and glens , though the au - thor evidently intends an intention deserving commendation that the ferns shall not suffer as a result of her efforts , for there is no chap - ter devoted to methods of collecting and pre - serving fern specimens .

		Two books upon flowers have appeared which differ widely in method , purpose , and execution .

		Miss Going 's '' Field , Forest , and Wayside Flowers '' is a series of popular essays re - printed in large part from the
New York	LOCATION	'' Even - ing Post '' and the '' Popular Science Monthly '' on botanical subjects suggested by the wax - ing and waning of plant life through the chang - ing seasons of the year in the northeastern
United States	LOCATION	.

		The work contains , in very attractive form , much information concerning the adaptations , the structural peculiarities , the physiological activities and the oscological rela - tions of many of our common flowering plants .

		It is intended for general readers with little knowledge of technical terms , rather than for students afield , though the latter will find in its pages much that will lend zest to an outing among our flowers in their native haunts .

		It abounds in suggestions for observation lessons .

		The illustrations are abundant , those from pho - tographs being especially commendable ; but the original pen-and-ink sketches are faulty in execution , and suffer by contrast with the re - printed figures .

		Miss
Lounsberry	PERSON	's '' Guide to the Wild Flowers , '' on the other hand , is a field manual , a sort of a '' royal road '' to a quick and ready identification of our common and most striking flowering plants .

		In this book all principles of systematic classification usually found in botanical manuals are set aside , and the plants are listed according to their haunts and asso - ciates .

		Thus , we find grouped together the plants which grow in water , in dry soil , and so on .

		In place of keys for identification we find abundant and most excellent illustrations , many of them from paintings by Mrs.
Rowan	PERSON	repro - duced here by the color-printing process .

		The descriptions are brief and simple , and are skil - fully arranged according to a simple system .

		The author has also given for each of the spe - cies a summary of the plant lore and the literary allusions appropriate to the flower .

		Teachers of nature work will find in this book much that is suggestive and helpful , and the 14 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, unscientific student of plants will find it a con - venient handbook .

		The '' First Book of Birds , '' by Mrs.
Olive Thome Miller	PERSON	, is the outgrowth of her experi - ence in talking to school children on birds and their ways .

		It is not so much a primer in ornithology as it is an appeal to the sympathy of children and an effort to interest them in the living bird '' neither as a target nor as a producer of eggs , but as a fellow-creature whose acquaintance it would be pleasant to make . ''

		This is an excellent motive , and it is well sus - tained throughout the book .

		Perhaps for this reason we can ignore the feeling that at times the facts are put to a slight tension .

		The gentler sex has no monopoly on the authorship of science works of popular interest . ''

		Every-day Butterflies , '' by Dr.
Scudder	PERSON	, is a model work of its kind .

		From the pen of a specialist , the book is authoritative and will command the interest alike of the biologist and of the general reader .

		It is gratuitous to sug - gest that it is dignified in statement and free from the extravagances and ofttimes unwar - ranted inferences that occasionally appear in the work of those who do not speak from ful - ness of knowledge , but compile at random .

		It is a plain and simple story of the life-histories of sixty-two of our common butterflies , all of which are illustrated , either in color or by ex - cellent cuts .

		The species are discussed in the order of their appearance during the year , and the story of their fleeting lives is told with wonderful minuteness of detail and withal with charming simplicity and directness .

		Students of nature and teachers of nature work will find this book a mine of suggestive information , and one well fitted to impart the spirit of patient investigation and to inculcate the habit of keen observation .

		Mr.
Howe	PERSON	in his '' On the Birds ' Highway '' takes his readers afield on a series of ornitho - logical outings at various seasons of the year .

		One spends a charming winter 's day among the birds on the sands of
Ipswich	LOCATION	, and another in the shadow of the
Presidential Range	ORGANIZATION	.

		The shores of
Rhode Island	LOCATION	, the shadow of Wachu - sett , and the '' Land of Norumbega '' are also visited .

		We are introduced to summer birds , to the resorters along
Atlantic	LOCATION	beaches , and to the frequenters of the Adirondack in the early autumn .

		Indeed , the author seems to have made the rounds of most of the popular Eastern resorts .

		The essays are pervaded by a decided literary flavor , and finished with an artistic , and at times poetic , touch .

		The au - thor has caught the spirit of the forest and shore , and his chapters breathe the monotony as well as the variety of nature .

		The book is handsomely gotten up and the illustrations are a fitting complement to the artistic text .


CHARLES A. KOFOID	PERSON	.

		SOME RECENT BOOKS or TRAVEL .

		* '' A Thousand Days in the Arctic , '' by Mr.
Frederick G. Jackson	PERSON	, describing three years ' residence and exploration in
Franz-Josef Land	PERSON	, is a disappointing book .

		In fact , it is not a book at all , but a mere aggregate of material for a book , as diary , letters , reports , etc. .

		We have a great many such entries as : '' At 2
A. M.	PERSON	moderate north wind .

		At 4 A. M. strong north - east wind , increasing to fresh gale at noon and gradually decreasing and veering at 8 p. M. to moderate north wind . ''

		Or , '' The mate came up to ask if I can let them have a little paraffin , as they have run out at the ship .

		I gave him ten gallons to go on with . ''

		If the nine hundred pages had been reduced to three hundred , and the material well written up in chapters on
Polar Bears	ORGANIZATION	,
Walrus	ORGANIZATION	, Sledging Journeys , etc. , we should have had a travel book of the first class instead of a bare record without literary quality .

		Nor can we speak well for the man - ufacture of the book , it being a heavy , clumsy volume , with highly glazed paper .

		The most interesting episode in the work is the author 's dramatic meeting with
Nansen	PERSON	. ''

		On our approaching each other , about three miles distant from the land , I saw a tall man on .

		* i-i , with roughly-made clothes , and an old felt hat on his head .

		He was covered with oil and grease , and black from head to foot .

		I at once concluded from his wearing ski that he was no English sailor , but that he must be a man from some Norwegian walrus sloop who had come to grief , and wintered somewhere on Franz-Josef Land in very rough circumstances .

		His hair was very long A THOUSAND DATS IK THE ARCTIC .

		15 and dirty , his complexion appeared to be fair , but dirt prevented me from being sure on the point , and his beard was straggly and dirty also .

		We shook hands heartily , and I expressed the greatest pleasure at seeing him .

		I inquired if he had a ship .

		No , ' he replied , ' my ship is not here , ' rather sadly I thought , and then he remarked , in reply to my question , that he had only one companion , who was at the floe edge .

		It then struck me that his features , in spite of the black grease and long hair and beard , resembled
Nansen	PERSON	, whom I had met once in
London	LOCATION	before he started in
1893	DATE	, and I exclaimed , Are n't you Nansen ? '

		to which he re - plied , ` Yes , I am Nansen . '

		With much heartiness I shook him warmly by the hand and said , ' By
Jove	PERSON	, I 'm d d glad to see you , ' and congratulated him on his safe arrival .

		Then I inquired , Where have you come from ? '

		He gave me a brief sketch of what had oc - curred , and replied , ' I left the '' Fram '' in 84 north lat - itude and 102 east longitude after drifting for two years , and I reached the 86 15 ' parallel , and I have now come here . ''

		Mr.
Jackson	PERSON	had much experience with bears and walrus , and mentions some observations of interest , for instance , of a walrus lying on his back , digging through the ice with his tusks .

		Ponies were found useful in the sledge jour - neys , and one pony even learned to eat bear - meat with relish .

		The scientific results of the expedition were considerable , and to some ex - tent are embodied in the appendices .

		The maps are good , the photographic illustrations only fair .

		Mr.
Frederick Palmer	PERSON	's '' In the Klondyke '' is a lively , sketchy , well illustrated book , de - scribing a trip made in the
spring of 1898	DATE	, during the great rush , when thirty-five thousand pilgrims poured into the Klondyke .

		The ex - citing pioneer life , with its vast variety of char - acters , is very cleverly drawn .

		The first boat into
Dawson	PERSON	had a cargo of two hundred dozen eggs , for which the dealer , '' a proud
Seattle	LOCATION	- ite , '' received
$ 3,600	MONEY	in less than an hour after he had landed . ''

		Those of the crowd who could afford it hurried off to the restaurant for a ' squar ' ' composed entirely of ' ham and . '

		The others , having to bide their time until luxuries were cheaper , found compensation in the items of news which were passed from tongue to tongue , for it had not occurred to the Seattleite to bring a newspaper with him .

		Thought there was more money in eggs , ' was his aggravating explanation .

		` Sposed you fellers wanted to eat , not to read . '

		As he had heard it , within a week after the declaration of war with
Spain	LOCATION	, the cruiser ``
New York	LOCATION	, '' Captain
Evans	PERSON	in command , had reduced the fortifications of
Havana	LOCATION	in three hours .

		The second Cheechawko to arrive assured us that this was quite untrue , and that two of Admiral
Sampson	PERSON	's squadron had been sunk and the Spaniards were win - ning on every hand .

		The crowd refused to believe any - thing of the kind , and the second Cheechawko received only
$ 14	MONEY	.

		a dozen for his eggs .

		With the next boat came a single newspaper , soiled with bacon grease .

		A curbstone speculator bought it for
fifteen dollars	MONEY	, stuffed it instantly into his inside coat pocket , and a few min - utes later was posting signs to the effect that all might hear the news of Admiral
Dewey	PERSON	's victory read by pay - ing a dollar apiece that evening .

		His entertainment would have netted him twice as much as it did if more than three hundred and fifty people could have been packed in the hall in which it was held .

		Some of the wealthy men considered this proceeding an outrage on personal liberty , and made it a point to buy between them any single copy of a paper later than any others that had arrived and have it read at once in the streets . ''

		We find in this book a very readable and ap - parently accurate account of the trails , of Daw - son and its life , of miners and mining , and of government and its policy , as they were in the
spring	DATE	and
summer of 1898	DATE	. ''

		Highways and Byways in
Donegal	LOCATION	and Antrim , '' by Mr.
Stephen Gwynn	PERSON	, is a pleas - antly written guide-book , from a cyclist point of view , to the northwestern Irish coast , '' from the wildest corners of the
West	LOCATION	, where Irish is still the language even of trade , business , and schools , into the very neighborhood of prosperous , commercial , up-to-date
Belfast	LOCATION	. ''

		As seeking to lure the visitor to this part of
Ireland	LOCATION	, it must be pronounced successful .

		It contains much on the history and customs of the people , and throws light on the peasantry past and present .

		One important recommend - ation is worth quoting for the benefit of tour - ists everywhere . ''

		There is one point which every Irishman writing a book for Englishmen in his country would wish to im - press , and that is to beg that tourists will not spoil the countryside by indiscriminate generosity .


Killarney	LOCATION	with its swarming beggars is an awful example .

		Even on the
Antrim Coast	LOCATION	small boys pursue the car or bicy - cle clamoring for pennies , and expect , on the beaten line of travel , to be paid for telling you the way .

		In
Donegal	LOCATION	happily none of these things exist . ''

		The numerous drawings by Mr.
Hugh Thom	PERSON	- son are good , and a refreshing change from the inartistic photographic illustrations now so common .

		Mr.
Keginald St. Barbe	PERSON	's little book '' In Modern
Spain	LOCATION	'' is a series of slight impression - ist sketches on such topics as the
Prado	LOCATION	, '' Manana , '' Bull-fights , Village Fiesta ,
Spanish Newspapers	ORGANIZATION	in the War , etc. .

		They well con - vey the spirit of the country , and are pleas - antly written . ''

		Across
India	LOCATION	at the Dawn of the
Twentieth Century	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Miss
Lucy E. Guinness	PERSON	, is a very ardent missionary book by one of the most noted of English evangelists .

		We have glimpses of mission work as seen in a three months ' tour through the principal missionary centres , and 16 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, there is a summary , gleaned from various sources , for the empire as a whole , making a very popular and vigorous sketch .

		It is illus - trated with many diagrams and photographic pictures .

		Another missionary book is '' In Afric 's Forest and Jungle , '' by Mr.
R. II	PERSON	.

		Stone .

		It is largely concerned with the appearance of the country and people , and with native wars in the section of
Africa	LOCATION	between the Bight of
Benin	LOCATION	and the
Niger River	LOCATION	.

		Here is a lively description of a party < > F Kroos : '' The Kroos live almost entirely on rice , and the quan - tity they can eat at a single sitting is quite incredible .

		I once saw a party take breakfast and I never shall forget the incident .

		Several Kroos formed a circle around a vessel full of steaming hot rice .

		The leader pot in his hand , took a quantity , tossed it over and over until it assumed the form of a ball about the size of a baseball and then pitched it into his widely distended mouth .

		As he was swallowing the mass he gave bis body a snake-like squirm so as to leave as much space as possible for more to follow .

		All the others of the party followed the example of their leader , going round and round with clock-like regularity until the rice was all gone .

		By this time their stomachs were distended like those of cattle in early
summer	DATE	. ''

		This book is a simple , direct account , and touches on some points not often mentioned by other writers . ''

		From Sea to Sea , '' by
Rudyard Kipling	ORGANIZATION	, is a resuscitation of letters of travel on
India	LOCATION	,
Burmah	LOCATION	,
China	LOCATION	,
Japan	LOCATION	, and
America	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	prefaces this book with the remark that he has been forced to collect these news - paper letters of
1887	DATE	to
1889	DATE	'' by the enter - prise of various publishers , who , not content with disinterring old newspaper work from the decent seclusion of the office files , have in sev - eral instances seen fit to embellish it with addi - tions and interpolations . ''

		This purely com - mercial remark rather prejudices the critic at the start ; and we regret that the impression is confirmed by perusal .

		These letters are quite too journalistic , crude , smart , and diffuse to warrant taking any place in the acknowledged works of
Rudyard Kipling	ORGANIZATION	.

		We quote this paragraph -LRB- a fair sample -RRB- on
Chicago	LOCATION	: '' I have struck a city , a real city , and they call it
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		The other places do not count .


San Francisco	LOCATION	is a pleasure resort as well as a city , and Salt Lake was a phenomenon .

		This place is the first American city I have encountered .

		It holds rather more than a million people with bodies , and stands on the same sort of soil as
Calcutta	LOCATION	.

		Having seen it , I urgently desire never to see it again .

		It is inhabited by savages .

		Its water is the water of the
Hngli	LOCATION	, and its air is dirt .

		Also it says that it is the < boss ' town of
America	LOCATION	. ''


HIRAM M. STANLEY	PERSON	.

		THE GENTLE AKT OF GARDENING .

		* From Abel to
Virgil	PERSON	, and from
Virgil	PERSON	to the present time , that branch of human endeavor which the encyclopaedias style '' Gardening ; see
Horticul	PERSON	- ture '' has been held in high favor among gods and men .

		If it is to the sturdier elder brother , Agri - culture , that we owe the staff of life and the few - score plants which afford us most of our sustenance , such joys as the strawberry and the prettily deli - cious family of small fruits , the herbs that lend flavor to life , and the trees , shrubs , and flowers that blossom within our days , are all within the province of the gardener as Miss
Gertrude Jekyll	PERSON	practices the gentle art .

		Though her admirable book , Wood and Garden , '' lacks the literary charm that apper - tains to '' Oar Gardens '' as seen by her distin - guished co-laborer , the Very
Reverend S. Reynolds Hole	PERSON	, dean of
Rochester	LOCATION	, it is none the less a book with a distinction and fascination of its own .

		One of the things assuredly the chief thing which distinguishes the work of Miss Jekyll from all of its kind is the attention she has paid to that lost sister among the seven , the sense of smell .

		Physiologists like Mr.
Havelock Ellis	PERSON	would have us believe that woman is lacking in the useful and neglected faculty of discerning and discriminating odors .

		But if this be true ,
Miss Jekyll	LOCATION	it is whose exceptional gifts in this direction proved a rule to the contrary . ''

		Passing upward through the copse , '' she writes of
April	DATE	, '' the warm air draws a fra - grance almost as sweet , but infinitely more subtle -LSB- than that of sweetbriar -RSB- , from the fresh green of the young birches ; it is like a distant whiff of lilies of the valley . ''

		There is not one man in a hundred who knows of the delicate scents from bourgeoning leafage in
April	DATE	, such odoriferous joys as inhere in the bursting shoots of the hackmatack or the great cotton woods .

		But Miss
Jekyll	ORGANIZATION	has so far progressed in the art that she is able to devote a chapter , almost unique , to '' The Scents of the Garden , '' beginning it with a sentence which has in it the root of the whole matter : '' The sweet scents of a garden are by no means the least of its many delights . ''

		From this grows a most exquisite essay on smells that are not merely '' sweet , '' but spicy , and suggestive , and balmy , and so near to stenches that no hard and fast line can be drawn ; for the connoisseurs in such matters know that distance and almost homoeopathic dilution can lend enchantment to carrion itself .

		This is true of some tropical plants : the tuberose in warmer countries , the jasmines and some of the lilies ; even , as is recorded here , the Balm of
Gilead	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- Cedronella triphylla -RRB- in
England	LOCATION	, all hover over the dividing line between delight and disgust .

		It suffices , this interesting chapter , to call to mind the slender tributes brought by the poets WOOD AMD GAKDKN : Notes and Thought * , Practical and Critical , of a Working Amateur .

Gertrude Jekyll	PERSON	.

New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1899 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 17 to a charming and sadly neglected source of pleas - ure and instruction .

		But it would be doing Miss
Jekyll	ORGANIZATION	's volume an injustice to leave the impression that its excellence is all bound up in this nicety of olfactory discernment .

		The ancient question of art and nature crops out in dissertations scattered through the book on the possibilities of cultivation and domestication in detracting from as well as adding to the delights brought by flowers .

		The author shows more than one case of real degenera - tion , of colors made ugly and forms made uncouth by gardeners lacking in taste .

		There is , too , a most useful following of the plants from
January	DATE	through
December	DATE	, making one wish for such a climate as the south of
England	LOCATION	, where flowers out of doors are possible in each of the twelve months .

		If one looks to Dean Hole for a higher literary perfection in his amiable discourse upon '' Our Gardens , '' one hardly expects at the same time to find a greater exhibition of technical knowledge than that displayed by his gentle fellow-author and fellow-enthusiast .

		But the versatile cleric proves himself no less adept in dealing with matters of somewhat recondite botany .

		Such a book for the gardener as
Izaak Walton	PERSON	wrote for the fisherman or
Gilbert White	ORGANIZATION	for the naturalist has yet to be written ; but something of the reward which will fall to the successful performer of this graceful task falls to Dean Hole here , as it has already fallen to Jef - frey in the matter of the field flowers .

		For his work teems with delicate scholarship , now Greek , now Latin , now a harking back to reproach
Lord Baeon	PERSON	for what he did not know about gardening or to praise
Addison	PERSON	for being in advance of his time , horticulturally speaking , and now citing the modern - est of instances in a manner he has made almost peculiar to himself , until the reader wonders if all cultivation , after all , does not come to the same thing , and culture and horticulture differ only as a part from the whole . ''

		What is the garden for ? ''

		he asks a '' middle-aged nymph , '' and she tells him : '' For the soul , sir , for the soul of the poet !

		For visions of the invisible , for grasping the intangible , for hearing the inaudible , for exaltations , '' and a page or two later there is a sigh for what might have befallen the dinner were the garden unknown : '' No tomatoes for the soup , no cucumbers for the salmon , no new potatoes , no crisp salad , no mint sauce for the lamb , no peas for the duck , no apples for the goose , '' proving the art to be not less worthy of the inner than the outer poet .

		It is
summer	DATE	now , when nature herself is supple - menting the plentiful illustrations of these two books in her own inimitable manner ; yet the volumes will furnish the letter-press for a better understanding of the part man plays when he leads with sympathy and reverence the footsteps of the Great Mother .

		And when the winter frosts have left us sighing anew for the climate of southern
England	LOCATION	, these pages will refresh the weariest with the thought of coming greenery and bloom .

		WALLACE RICE .

		RECENT FICTION .

		* It is now something like twelve years since a novel called '' The New Antigone , '' published anony - mously , attracted widespread attention on account of its somewhat audacious treatment of the problem of love without legal sanction .

		When it transpired that the novel had been written by Dr.
William Barry	PERSON	, a Catholic priest , it seemed still more remark - able , because clerical novelists , when they handle such subjects at all , are apt to do it gingerly , and with much parade of didacticism .

		But here was a clerical writer who frankly accepted the artistic rule of leaving the moral implicit , instead of forc - ing it upon the reader 's attention .

		The moral was unquestionably there , but the book gave offense to too many people who would like to exclude certain subjects altogether from literary treatment .

		Now , after this long silence , we have a second novel , this time acknowledged , from the same hand .

		It is called '' The Two Standards , '' a title suggested by the '' Spiritual Exercises of
St. Ignatius	LOCATION	, '' and this is to be taken in the obvious sense .

		That is , the two ideals that struggle for the mastery over the two human souls in whom our interest chiefly centres are , on the one hand , the ideal of worldly prosperity and sensual gratification ; on the other , * THE Two STANDARDS .

July 1	DATE	, the ideal of renunciation and spiritual triumph .

		The story reminds us not a little of ''
Evelyn Innes	PERSON	, '' although not brought to so conclusive a ter - mination .

		In both there is a woman tempted , and in both music is made the means of temptation .

		But in the cace of Dr.
Barry	PERSON	's novel , we are left in no doubt whatever of the reality of the spiritual recoil of the heroine . '

		The Two Standards '' is an improvement upon '' The New Antigone '' in its strictly literary aspects , although it is still too rhe - torical , too overloaded with discursive reflection .

		We lose sight of the story for long periods , but it must be admitted that during these periods we have for recompense the constant contact with an acute and brilliant intellect For it is evident that the author 's life has not been cloistered in any deaden - ing sense ; he has not lost sight of the intellectual and artistic currents of the age ; he has realized that the problems of life are to be faced and not ignored .

		In brief , the book has so many fine qual - ities that its technical shortcomings considered in the light of mere fiction do not impel us to deal with it harshly , or to make our final word anything but one of praise .

		It is a '' Boheme '' something like that of
Henri Murger	PERSON	or as nearly like it as possible under mod - ern conditions into which we are taken by '' The Rapin , '' a story by Mr.
Henry De Vere Stacpoole	PERSON	.

		The chief variant from
Murger	PERSON	's theme is that the hero is not naturalized in the Pays Latin , being rather an aristocratic youth of the Rive Droite who takes up his abode in
Bohemia	LOCATION	to escape from the emptiness of his former fashionable surroundings .

		How he lives there with
Celestin	PERSON	, but wearies of that life no less than of the other , how he is bled by vari - ous sorts of parasites , how he discovers that he is an artist only in the flattering words of his interested followers , how Ce ` lestin dies of pneumonia , and her lover goes back to conventionality , all these things , and many more , are told with much anima - tion and some humor in this book of '' The Rapin . ''

		Some of the minor characters , too , are engagingly interesting
Gaillard	PERSON	the poet , and the people whom he invents upon the spur of the moment ,
Pelisson	PERSON	the journalist , and
Nani	PERSON	the vicious old roue who plays his patrons such tricks .

		As for the hero , who is called Toto , we will simply say that the name fits him like a glove .

		Mr.
Merriman	PERSON	's novels have always reminded us of something vaguely familiar , but it was not until reading '' Dross '' the other day that the reminis cence took concrete shape .

		In the crisp precision of his manner , in his exhibition of the dry sort of intellectuality that never allows emotion to get the upper hand , in his display of wide interests and information , and , we must add , in his inability to sound more than half-way the depths of the soul he writes as does
M. Cherbuliez	PERSON	, and makes to his readers much the same sort of appeal . ''

		Dross , '' which is certainly as good as the best of his pre - vious work , is a novel of the annee terrible , although the sinister happenings of that period are kept well in the background , and serve but ax the framework for a tale of private life , suitably romantic , and waxing into melodrama for one brief hour .

		The author 's characters are not all clearly realized , and his whole story is based upon a vast structural im - probability , but the management of it all is so ingenious , and the minor technique BO admirable , that it amply fulfils its promise made manifest in the opening pages , of an hour of exceptionally pleasant entertainment .

		One or two of his previous novels , '' Derelicts '' in particular , have accustomed us to expect good lit - erary workmanship from Mr.
William J. Locke	PERSON	, and his new novel , called '' Idols , '' brings with it no disappointment .

		Yet it does not seem to be of his very best , and its failure to reach his previous high standard is probably attributable to a resort to something suspiciously like melodrama , and his evident determination to create a startling situation , at whatever cost of probability .

		The woman who commits perjury to save a friend , and who at the same time deliberately assumes as far as the eye of the public is concerned the role of a dishon - ored wife , acts in a way that only casuistry can justify , and the purity of her motive can not con - done the offense .

		Such is the substance of the tragic story that Mr.
Locke	PERSON	has woven for us , and , interesting as it is , there is an ethically unwhole - some flavor that remains , while the interest fades in the memory .

		Dr.
Conan Doyle	PERSON	must have great confidence in his public , judging from the experiments that he tries upon it from time to time .

		Since his deserved early successes in historical romance , he has pro- duced a series of books in various manners that were either confessed pot-boilers , and consequently calling for no serious consideration , or attempts to do things for which he had obviously no aptitude whatever .

		His latest book touches what we must believe to be the very bottom of the pit into which he has fallen .

		For absolute imbecility it would be hard to match a book of which the following extract is fairly illustrative : '' For the underground railway is blessed as regards privacy above all other lines , and where could a loving couple be more happy who have been torn apart by cruel fate for seven long hours or so ?

		It was with a groan that
Frank	ORGANIZATION	remarked that they had reached Mark Lane . '' '

		Bother ! '

		said
Maude	PERSON	, and wondered if there was any shop near where she could buy hairpins .

		As every lady knows or will know there is a very intimate con - nection between hairpins and a loviug husband . ''

		There are whole chapters of this maudlin drivel ; in fact , there is little else .

		The story is concerned with nothing under the sun but the courtship and early married life of two commonplace young peo - ple , described in the minutest detail .

		It should have appeared -LRB- and remained buried -RRB- in The Ladies ' Home Journal . ''

		After this book , even Mr.
Le Gallienne	PERSON	's '' Young Lives , '' which is also concerned with the same cal -
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 19 low period in the development of its characters , seems fresh and delightful reading , although a nor - mal critical judgment would doubtless feel bound to bear down rather heavily upon its sentimental - ism and lack of any sort of virility .

		But there is a curious mixture of strength with weakness in this , as in the author 's other books , and , unsatisfactory as it may be in some aspects , in others it compels our admiration for its delicacy and its insight .

		For example , it gives us such a glimpse as no writer could have imagined of the inner life of middle - class nonconformist society in
Liverpool	LOCATION	.

		The au - thor has clearly lived that life in his youth , and knows it from the inside .

		However , this is no new thing for readers of Mr.
Le Gallienne	PERSON	's books , but merely the restatement of a familiar and redeeming quality . ''

		Young Lives '' is a pleasant little book , marred by but one very conspicuous fault of taste , which may be found in the chapter entitled '' The Wits . ''

		Here the hero , a youth with aspirations toward literature , is introduced to a
London	LOCATION	gath - ering , among whom it is very easy to pick out cer - tain actual individuals .

		The '' learned homunculus '' is not difficult to identify , nor is the '' short , firmly built clerkly fellow , with a head like a billiard-ball in need of a shave , a big brown moustache , and enor - mous spectacles . ''

		These things by themselves would not be so bad , but the author goes rather be - yond the limit when he brings himself into the com - pany with the following sentence : '' There entered a tall young man with a long , thin face , curtained on either side with enormous masses of black hair , like a slip of the young moon glimmering through a pine-wood . ''

		Presently this '' moon-in-the-pine - wood '' apparition is contrasted with the billiard - headed and bespectacled individual in the following terms : '' That is our young apostle of sentiment , our new man of feeling , the best-hated man we have ; and the other is our young apostle of blood .

		He is all for muscle and brutality and he makes all the money ... But my impression is that our young man of feeling will have his day , though he will have to wait for it . ''

		The naivete of this observation is so refreshing that one almost forgets that it should have been left to someone else to make .

		In '' The Black
Douglas	PERSON	, '' Mr.
Crockett	PERSON	takes for his subject the fall of the great house that dom - inates the picturesque tradition of fifteenth century
Scotland	LOCATION	.

		He varies his theme , however , by intro - ducing the sinister figure of
Gilles de Retz	PERSON	, and the latter half of the romance takes us to
France	LOCATION	and tells the grewsome story that
Dumas	PERSON	has embodied in '' Les Louves de Machecoul . ''

		There is no new thing in this romance , and no new manner ; the book is a typical example of Mr.
Crockett	PERSON	's work - manship , exhibiting its virtues and its defects .

		Among the latter , garrulity has always been prom - inent , and in the present instance it seems to have grown upon the writer .

		We have previously expressed the opinion that Mr.
S. R. Keightley	PERSON	was quite as ingenious as Mr.
Weyman	PERSON	as an artificer of what has come to be of late years the popular sort of historical romance .

		This opinion is fortified by `` The Silver Cross , '' which , if it be not quite equal to '' The Cavaliers , '' is all that one could reasonably expect of such a book .

		The story is concerned with the intrigues of
Madame de Chevreuse	ORGANIZATION	against
Cardinal Maz	ORGANIZATION	- arin , and is packed with excitement of the most romantic sort .

		Books of this pattern are usually as much alike as so many peas , and the conventional pattern is followed by Mr.
Keightley	PERSON	, but this is no reproach to a narrative that is so successful in pro- viding entertainment for its readers .

		Mr.
Guy Boothby	PERSON	seems to have taken the hint that his public is a little tired of Dr.
Nikola	PERSON	, and has ostensibly shelved that fiendish individual .

		Yet we can not help feeling that it is the same malignant personality that lurks beneath the mask of Pharos the Egyptian in Mr.
Boothby	PERSON	's new novel .

		Pharos , we learn , was master of the magicians at the court of the Pharoah of the Exodus , and found his arts pitted against those of
Moses	PERSON	, much to his discom - fiture .

		In due time , he became a mummy , but he really did n't die at all , getting in some unexplained way a new frame in which to prowl about the world .

		Thus we are introduced to him in the nineteenth century , concerned with getting possession of his own mummy -LRB- which has been brought to
England	LOCATION	by an Egyptologist -RRB- , and also with a diabolical scheme for getting even with mankind by infecting
Europe	LOCATION	with the plague .

		How he accomplishes these ends , making an English artist his unwitting accomplice , and how he finally dies -LRB- for good , let us hope -RRB- , is told us in Mr.
Boothby	PERSON	's romance , which finds no trick of sensationalism too cheap to be used , and which has not the slightest claim -LRB- any more than its predecessors -RRB- to be considered a lit - erary production . ''

		The Enchanted Stone , '' by Mr.
Lewis Hind	PERSON	, is another fantastic romance which brings the ancient Orient and the modern Occident into juxtaposition , just as Mr.
Boothby	PERSON	does , only with greater inge - nuity and a finer sense of what is demanded by lit - erary art .

		The stone in question is a miraculous jewel that finds its way from
India	LOCATION	to
England	LOCATION	, and is tracked by an uncanny '' yellow man '' who sticks at nothing in bis efforts to regain possession of the talisman .

		Having done so , he takes advantage of the credulity of an eccentric and wealthy English - woman , and they proceed together to start a new religion , erecting for its service a temple of unex - ampled splendor upon the coast of
Cornwall	LOCATION	.

		The unsophisticated Cornishmen , looking upon the tem - ple with disfavor , organize a raid , and proceed to demolish it .

		The credulous Englishwoman dies , and the yellow man -LRB- with his jewel -RRB- escapes , pre - sumably to his own
India	LOCATION	.

		The story is one of the wildest of extravaganzas , yet it has a certain fas - cination , and even , in its earlier chapters , reminds us slightly of the '' New Arabian Nights . ''

		Mr.
E. F. Benson	PERSON	achieved so pronounced a suc - cess in '' The Vintage '' that he has done well to 20 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, write a second romance of the Greek Revolution .

		This new story is entitled `` The Capsina , '' and is a sequel to the earlier one in that it continues the chronicle of the heroic cause for which Byron fought and
Shelley	PERSON	sang .

		It also has for its hero the lit - tle Mitaos '' of '' The Vintage , '' who in this book takes to the sea , and proves himself no less a fighter there than on the land .

		Bat the interest in Mitaos ia overshadowed by that which we take in the hero - ine the Capsina for whom the book is named .

		This fine and inspired figure is a true creation , who in her glowing life and heroic death so compels our admiration that we are ready to overlook the defects of the work its occasional trivialities , longueurs , and confusions . ''

		The Brothers of the People '' is a romance of revolutionary
Balkania	LOCATION	, garnished with villainies , conspiracies , and bombs .

		A young English girl goes to the country to act as companion to the daughter of an influential statesman , and becomes mixed up in many affairs of which she had no anticipation when she accepted the position .

		The story is a com - bination of sentimentalism , improbability , and puer - ilily .

		entirely out of the reach of serious criticism .

		Mrs.
Augustus Moore	PERSON	, who writes under the name of
Martin J. Pritchard	PERSON	, '' is bent upon being start - ling , whatever the cost in probability and good taste .

		Her first novel , '' Without Sin , '' told the story of a woman laboring under the singular delusion that she waa in very truth the reincarnation of the mother of God .

		Her second venture , `` The Passion of
Rosamund Keith	PERSON	, '' now before us , has for its climax the physical crucifixion of a woman by a mob of superstitious Albanian mountaineers .

		This scene can not be described as other than revoltingly sensa - tional , yet it must be admitted that the book as a whole has literary quality beyond what is common in sensational and sentimental fiction .

		The writer has no mean powers of vivid delineation , applied to both scenes and situations , and the advance in crafts - manship over her earlier book is unquestionable .

		The plot hinges upon the love of
Paul Carr	PERSON	for
Rosamund Keith	PERSON	.

		This is at first crossed by a bit of scandal that any sensible lovers would have ignored , then
Paul	PERSON	goea into a monastic retreat and joins the Catholic church , then he remembers the fact -LRB- strangely forgotten up to this moment -RRB- that he baa a divorced wife still living , and finally -LRB- for by such tortuous logic does the story proceed -RRB- , his newly-made vows so weigh upon him that he deter - mines to renounce
Rosamund	PERSON	.

		Thus far , the book ia a story of English society .

		It is only toward the close that the scene shifts to
Eastern Europe	LOCATION	, and we come to the startling episode already mentioned .

		It must be added that
Paul	PERSON	's divorced wife dies moat conveniently , and that the literal '' passion '' of
Rosamund	PERSON	does not terminate fatally .

		Curiously enough , the same problem of marriage with a man whose divorced wife is still living occu - pies the central place in Mrs.
Wilfred Ward	PERSON	's `` One Poor Scruple . ''

		The object of thia book , aside from the discussion of thia central problem , ia clearly to place before its readers a picture of everyday life in the Catholic households of English society , and to sketch society itself from the Catholic point of view .

		Were it not that Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	speaks of her book aa having been in course of preparation for the past seven years , we should be tempted to speak of it as a studied attempt to counteract the effect of the latest novel of another and more famous Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	that is , the effect of Helbeck of Banniadale . ''

		In a word , it presents what may be called the nor - mal type of English Catholicism , and thus stands in marked contrast to the striking , but surely abnormal , type in which Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	so deeply en - gages our interest Viewed in relation to its central problem , '' One Poor Scruple '' is a story of sharp temptation and eventual spiritual triumph .

		Con - sidered aa an unpretentious delineation of social conditions , it is faithfully studied and deserving of every praise .

		Taken as a portrait gallery of many sorts and conditions of men and women , it achieves an unusual degree of success in its delineations .

		We get to know these people from the inside , although the external trick of manner is by no means ignored , and as we close the book , we feel that of its many admirable qualities this penetrative insight into character is the one that chiefly calls for praise .

		The romantic materials of Mrs.
Crowninshield	PERSON	's Latitude 19 '' are promising enough .

		The Island of
Haiti	LOCATION	in the twenties , the reign of terror estab - lished by
Christophe	PERSON	the
Caligula	LOCATION	or Tiberius of the island the horrid mysteries of vuudou fetich - ism , the cannibalism of the natives , the buccaneers that infested the coast and made their lairs in its caves , all these things are exciting indeed , and when we bring a party of shipwrecked Yankees into such surroundings , we seem to have an embarrassment of riches .

		Unfortunately , the writer ia without the constructive skill needful for the shaping of a con - nected story out of these matters , and her book re - mains a congeries of imperfectly connected episodes , a jumble of excitements and terrors , a kaleidoscope of fantastic unrealities .

		The Espiritu Santo '' of
Miss Skinner	PERSON	, a daugh - ter of the author of '' Two Years before the Mast , '' is a book about French , Spanish , and Italian people , mostly connected with the operatic stage , and about as unreal as attempts at characterization could easily be .

		They constantly express '' such noble senti - ments '' that the
Marquis	PERSON	of
Posa	PERSON	would have taken them to his heart , but they never impress us as being living people of flesh and blood .

		The religious feeling of the story is so tender and beautiful that we can not speak of its spirit in terms of too cordial commendation , but the application of these terms must ceane with the spirit ; when we come to the execution of the book , considered simply as a novel , and not aa didacticiam or fine writing , it is impos - sible to call it anything but a failure .

		The peculiar charm of Mr.
Howells	PERSON	when he is at his best reappears , after several recent eclipses , in the novel which he has fantastically styled '' Ragged Lady . ''

		It ia a charm compounded of several ele -
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 21 ments , and not easy of analysis .

		It is not merely the quality of minute observation , tinged with lam - bent humor , because we find that in some of his least satisfactory performances .

		It is something beyond this , and in the present instance it is found , at least in part , in his recurrence to those Italian scenes which have before proved his best inspiration , and in still greater part to his gentle heroine , whose imperturbable spirit no splendors can dazzle and no vicissitudes can embitter .

		The placidity and sweet - ness of
Clementina	PERSON	, the '' ragged lady '' of this tale , offers so refreshing a contrast to the high-strung and emotional heroines of so much of our fiction that we can be only grateful for the acquaintance , even if
Clementina	PERSON	is a trifle anaemic , besides being afflicted at moments by an aggravated and distressing form of the celebrated
New England	LOCATION	conscience .

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	still likes to puzzle his readers by the play of elusive motives , and
Clementina	PERSON	's several senti - mental entanglements come upon us as a series of imperfect surprises , causing us to observe her career with a certain zest , but not quite in accordance with the canons of clear-cut art .

		The minor figures in this gallery are also interesting , every one , from the Russian socialist to the
Michigan	LOCATION	parson , and their characters are drawn for us with touches that are as delicate as those of a
Meissonier	PERSON	, and far more revealing withal .

		If
California	LOCATION	sends us many more such novels as '' The Procession of Life , '' it will have to be reck - oned with in our literary geography more seriously than hitherto .

		The
California	LOCATION	once revealed to us by Mr.
Bret Harte	PERSON	has passed so completely away from the actual world that the stories still written by him , in the seclusion of the
Athenaeum Club	ORGANIZATION	, delightful as they are , must be described as the productions of a literary Rip
Van Winkle	PERSON	, whose present is the remote past of everybody else .

		Since the
Harte	PERSON	period of Californian society , so great an evolution has taken place that Mr.
Vachell	PERSON	's novel seems to come from an entirely different world .

		It is a world that has not remained absolutely unre - vealed to us , for it has already lived a sort of lit - erary life in the brilliant crudity of Mrs.
Atherton	PERSON	's novels , in the slighter and far more delicate work of Mrs.
Graham	PERSON	, and , of course , in ''
Ramona	PERSON	. ''

		We have also been brought close to it by Mr.
Van Dyke	PERSON	's '' Millionaires of a Day , '' a book which , although not a novel , has a far greater interest than most fiction , and which is suggested by the new book now under consideration .

		The connecting link in this case is provided by the story of the `` boom '' that struck
Southern California	LOCATION	in the early eighties .

		The leading characters in Mr.
Vachell	PERSON	's novel are made to pass through the storm and stress of that speculative period , to suffer in the swift reac - tion , and at last to share in the temperate prosperity of still more recent years .

		The book is rich in human interest , and is distinctly the best novel that has thus far been written of latter-day
California	LOCATION	.

		If drawing-rooms were the world , and those who have their being in them the whole of mankind , one could have no reasonable ground for dissatisfaction with the novels of Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	.

		We certainly do get from his books about everything , in the way of both conversation and action , that a decorous drawing-room can shelter , and we get it in such delicate forms of artistic presentation that no pre - text is left us for adverse criticism .

		In '' The Awk - ward Age , '' for example , than which even Mr.
James	PERSON	has produced no better book , there are nearly five hundred pages of drawing-room talk and inci - dent , all delightfully finished and subtle , all dis - playing workmanship of the highest cherry-stone order , and yet we are inexpressibly wearied by it , because it has so little to do with anything that makes life really worth having , and we worry through it from a sense of duty rather than for sat - isfaction with its message .

		The outcome is naught , as far as we are able to discern , and not one ac - quaintance has been made with whom we would desire further commerce .

		It will be remembered that the death of
Harold Frederic	PERSON	left among his manuscripts two unpub - lished novels , both dealing with English society .

		The first of them , which appeared promptly , was called ''
Gloria Mundi	PERSON	, '' and the best efforts of his friends to deal kindly with it could not conceal the fact that it was relatively a failure , and a failure pre - cisely because its author had gained only a superficial knowledge of the society which he sought to depict .

		His other posthumous novel , '' The Market - Place , '' has now been published , and proves to be a far more satisfactory piece of work .

		The author is still clearly not at home in his new environment , but he has at least chosen a theme fairly within the reach of his intelligence .

		The business of company - promotion is comprehensible enough to an alert and clear-headed American writer , whether it be carried on in Wall Street or
Capel Court	ORGANIZATION	, and this novel deals with the flotation of a Mexican rubber company by the devices made so familiar during the
Hooley	PERSON	investigation of
last year	DATE	.

		The hero of this speculation is an Americanized English - man who plans his coup with Napoleonic strategy , and wins for himself a colossal fortune at the ex - pense of the '' shorts , '' who have been tricked into selling shares of which he alone has absolute con - trol .

		When the settlement comes , they are bled white , and the buccaneer retires with his spoils .

		This is a very unconventional sort of morality , for the ethics of such a story are supposed to demand that the speculator shall be exposed and come to grief .

		Instead of this , our speculator covers up all the traces of his swindle , wins an aristocratic wife , and realizes his ambition of settling down as an English country gentleman .

		The moral that the author points is something quite different from what is expected , and we are by no means sure that it is not equally satisfactory .

		Certainly it is more subtle than the conventional moral , for it emphasizes the lesson that riches , however acquired , are a doubtful good to the man who is without inner resources to make possible their enjoyment .

		We leave him in THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, lion of all the externals of happiness , yet a profoundly unhappy and discontented mortal .

		And at least there is the negative satisfaction of know - ing that his wealth has been gained at the expense of men who deserve no sympathy , and the positive satisfaction of witnessing his achievement , under highly exciting and dramatic circumstances , of his purpose .

		The hook is not exactly fine , but it is unquestionably both strong and interesting .

MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		LtlUrt ^ The comely volume containing '' The aidoWopmpAy Autobiography and Letters '' -LRB- one - ojMrt .

		oilplant .

		f ourtn autobiography and three - fourths letters -RRB- of that worthy woman and gifted writer , Mrs.
M. O. W. Oliphant	PERSON	, will appeal to a large circle of readers .

		Mrs.
Harry Caghill	PERSON	is the editor , and she has done her work with due care and tact Mrs.
Oliphant	PERSON	once described herself as '' a writer very little given to explanations or to any personal appearance . ''

		Her work was for the pub - lic , her life for her family and chosen friends ; and when , toward the close of
June , 1897	DATE	, she lay dying in her sunny little home at
Wimbledon	LOCATION	, she laid upon those about her the injunction that no biogra - phy of her was to be written .

		Those familiar with Mrs.
Oliphant	PERSON	's writings as a whole will have noted in some of the latest of them a certain tendency to depart from her habitual altitude of reserve .

		And that she realized that the biography she dreaded was in one form or another inevitable , and that no injunction she could lay on her friends would avail to baffle the public 's desire to know something of the story of her life , is shown by the fact that long before her death she began to jot down at odd times scraps more or less autobiographical , to which were added , later , some account of her earliest years .

		Later still , at the request of her last surviving child , she continued this fragmentary memoir , bringing it down to the date at which her sons entered
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		These writings form the narrative portion of the volume now before us , and they have been supple - mented with the letters , which Mrs.
Caghill	PERSON	has arranged in their chronological order , and connected with a thread of story where needed .

		It should be added that Mrs.
Oliphant	PERSON	's wishes were not disre - garded in publishing this material . ''

		She bade as , '' says Mrs.
Caghill	PERSON	, '' deal with it as we thought best . ''

		While Mrs.
Oliphant	PERSON	's narrative is thoroughly read - able , and , in its light way , informing , it is the let - ters that form the more important and interesting portion of the volume .

		The largest part of these are to members of the
Blackwood	PERSON	family , and they give an almost connected history of Mrs.
Oliphant	PERSON	's work .

		Their general readableness , it must be owned , is not impaired by a certain note of asperity in the writer 's tone when she is speaking of literary people .

		Even
George Eliot	PERSON	-LRB- whom Mrs.
Oliphant	PERSON	for a long time '' can not believe to be a woman '' -RRB- does not quite escape .

		Macaulay is styled '' the historian of sophistication , who writes only and always for so - ciety , '' whom `` everybody admires , '' and in whom '' nobody believes . ''

		As to
Miss Martineau	PERSON	, Mrs.
Oliphant	PERSON	is struck by `` the curious limited folly of her apparent common-sense , '' and can only wonder how such a commonplace mind could have attained the literary position she did . ''

		In one letter to Mr.
W. Blackwood	PERSON	, Mrs.
Oliphant	PERSON	grimly expresses a wish to review Mr.
Howells	PERSON	and certain other American writers , promising to do her best to put these
Jacobs	PERSON	of literature on their true level . ''

		A note to Mr.
Blackwood	PERSON	, from
Oxford	LOCATION	, comments amusingly on the tone of the town and its notabili - ties .

		The writer goes on to say : '' Almost every - body who is anybody has called , I think ; but intel - lectualism , like every other ism , is monotonous , and the timidity and mutual alarm of the younger po - tentates strikes me a good deal .

		They are so much afraid of committing themselves or risking any - thing that may be found wanting in any minutiae of correctness .

		Scholarship is a sort of poison tree that kills everything . ''

		While the present volume is not , actually or ostensibly , a full and sufficient life of Mrs.
Oliphant	PERSON	, it is fresh and entertaining , well leavened with ` personal comment and anecdote , and just the sort of biography one may venture upon with a light heart in the dog-days .

		There are two portraits , and there ought to have been an index .

Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,

John Cole	PERSON	- man
Adams	PERSON	's '' Nature Studies in Berkshire '' -LRB- Put - nam -RRB- , with its beautiful pictures of hill and dale , climbing road and falling meadow .

		The inevita - bility of the association of '' flat '' with '' stale and unprofitable '' is more apparent with the progress of every chapter , till the sigh that brought forth the hanging gardens of
Babylon	LOCATION	is repeated after many ages .

		So many American artists and poets have gone to these self-same scenes for inspiration , it is only wonderful that the pleasant duty of celebration which Mr.
Adams	PERSON	has imposed upon himself should have been reserved for him by a kindly fate .

		And that the fate was kindly , for the reader no less than the writer , these pleasant pages tell .

		Western
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, the scene of Dr.
Underwood	PERSON	's
New England	LOCATION	town , has long awaited the coming of some
American Jeffrey	ORGANIZATION	, someone who should add to the love of wild nature and sympathy with all its phases the flavor of the children of the soil .

		Than Dr.
Adams	PERSON	no one could be better fitted for the task , either by birth or nurture , and his book in informed with the spirit of the place and the spirit of the people of the place .

		A higher morality , the moral - ity of fitness , takes the place of too obvious preach - ing ; the contrasts of the external world find inter - pretation in the contrasts of words which bespeak wit ; the erudition of nature is interpreted by the
Brrkthire	PERSON	hill i and
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 23 erudition of broad cultivation ; and the result is wholly pleasing .

		The very chapter titles prove it : `` The Dome of the Taconics , '' '' The Circumvention of
Greylock	ORGANIZATION	, '' `` The Social Flowers , '' `` At the Sign of the Beautiful Star , '' `` The Great Cloud Drive , '' all these and many more speak the thought of the lover and friend , who sets down a moment in literature , less enduring than the everlasting hills he writes of , but one which will make a lasting appeal nevertheless . ''

		The hot and steaming city is leagues away , '' he tells us in one place . ''

		All that is vanished ; and instead of it , a scene meets the eye in which one loses sense and thought in a sweet oblivion of content ... The air quivers and throbs over a rye-field .

		The far hills retreat still farther behind a blue haze ... Under the maples here in
Berkshire	LOCATION	is an incomparable vantage - ground from which to behold the glories of mid -
summer	DATE	as they pass by . ''

		This vantage-ground we do not begrudge the good Doctor , nor , since we may not share it , do we cease to be thankful for this reminiscence of it ; but we wish it were with us a personal memory , even as it is with him .

		For this new longing and aspiration in a life too short for the fulfilment of half the old ones , his graphic pages must be held responsible .

		Mr.
W. G. Aston	PERSON	's '' History of Jap - The story of anege Lj terature '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- is the Japanese tetters .

		.

		PII-II .

		sixth volume thus far published in the .

		series called '' Literatures of the World . ''

		The au - thor opens this preface with the following remarks : '' The Japanese have a voluminous literature , ex - tending over twelve centuries , which to this day has been very imperfectly explored by European stu - dents .

		Forty years ago no Englishman had read a page of a Japanese book , and although some
Continental	ORGANIZATION	scholars had a useful acquaintance with the language , their contributions to our knowledge are unimportant ... Beyond a few brief detached notices , there is no body of critical opinion on Jap - anese books in any European language . ''

		Mr.
Aston	PERSON	's position in putting forth such a '' body of critical opinion '' is in one respect enviable .

		No reviewer is likely to assume the superior airs of his kind , and play the pedagogue with the author .

		The latter has things all his own way , and the former , however omniscient he may upon other occasions seem , is for once humbled .

		We can say nothing of this book beyond testifying to its thoroughly read - able character , which is largely due to the free use of translated passages , biographical notices , and historical data .

		In other words , the things that a reader would be expected to know beforehand in the case of a European literature could not possibly be expected of him in this case , and Mr.
Aston	PERSON	has done well to keep this fact constantly in mind .

		As for the difficulties encountered in the translations , the following observations are much to the point : '' The cherry is , in
Japan	LOCATION	, the queen of flowers , and is not valued for its fruit , while the rose is re - garded as a mere thorny bush .

		Valerian , which to us is suggestive principally of cats , takes the place of the rosebud as the recognized metaphor for the early bloom of womanhood . ''

		A still more curi - ous illustration of the vagaries of association is offered by '' The Ladies of New Style , '' an advanced novel of to-day , in which the new woman heroine is a dairymaid , not , forsooth , to indicate pastoral simplicity , but rather the most advanced radicalism . ''

		Formerly , '' we are told , '' cow 's milk was not used as food in
Japan	LOCATION	, and when this novel ap - peared -LRB- 1887 -RRB- none but a truly enlightened person would dare to affront the old-fashioned prejudices against it . ''

		We congratulate Mr.
Aston	PERSON	upon the acceptable manner in which he has told us the long story of Japanese letters , and we certainly have no reason to doubt that he is as trustworthy an author - ity as he is an interesting historian .

		There were stirring times in
Mis	LOCATION	- Border fighting j in th ope ning months of the in the Civil War .

		.

		n - r great civil conflict of a generation ago .

		The history of the struggle to keep the Bor - der States in the
Union	ORGANIZATION	is an interesting one , and one which is always told with intense emotions , be - cause brother rose against brother , and the feud-like character of the fighting was marked .

		But the great movements of later years obscured the fron - tier contests , and the historians have been accus - tomed to dismiss with a few paragraphs what Mr.
Britton	PERSON	in his `` Civil War on the Border '' -LRB- Put - nam -RRB- describes with the detail of an eye-witness .

		The second volume of this work continues the tale of the activities of local militia in
Missouri	LOCATION	,
Arkansas	LOCATION	,
Indian Territory	ORGANIZATION	, and
Kansas	LOCATION	, against the bands of guerrillas under such leaders as the infamous Quan - trill or the desperate bandit ,
Bill Anderson	PERSON	.

		General
Sherman	PERSON	's oft-quoted words descriptive of war cer - tainly have apt illustration in the stories told in these volumes , and perhaps there can be no better preventive of internal commotions than the re - hearsal of the experiences of the frontier folk dur - ing the years when the armies of the two sections were fighting , now in the West and later in Vir - ginia , for the settlement of the great struggle .

		What the raids of the Tories were in days of the Rev - olution , the swift and awful descents of the bandits of the Western frontier were to the loyal people in days of the Rebellion .

		Possibly war can not be refined , and yet it seems likely that the changes in American life during the
last quarter	DATE	of a century have made it impossible that our land should ever again witness such scenes as those described by writers about the border fights of the Civil War .

		Readers of Mr.
John Davidson	PERSON	who A playwright remember with pleasure his ' > Plays '' and AM prologue .

		J of five years ago have probably by this time read his '' Godfrida '' -LRB-
John Lane	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Those who remember the '' Plays '' with only a confused feeling akin to anger , may have neglected the book .

		To these latter , however , we must recommend at least the Prologue , which will not trouble them long 24 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, It presents us with a conversation between the Poet himself and an Interviewer , and thus gives Mr.
Davidson	PERSON	a chance to speak of his ideas and inten - tions .

		This we rather like .

		Probably every author has sometime had a vague feeling that be would like to write reviews explaining the point of his work , even if he has also had a counter feeling that his work ought to explain itself .

		Mr.
Davidson	PERSON	's views are good .

		We like particularly his disclaimer of any attempt to revive the Jacobean drama or the Elizabethan eclogue , or to follow in the path of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, which last few would have supposed a temp - tation to him .

		We like , too , his view of Romance as the essence of Reality .

		Certainly the Prologue should find readers .

		And as to the play , well , it is impossible to say anything about Mr.
Davidson	PERSON	's plays without explaining and arguing a good deal , and for that we have not now the time .

		Those who would like a dramatist to come to them with an amusing or even instructive tale will be disappointed .

		Those who are intoxicated at a snuff or two of the fresh air of poetry , or with the lifting now and then of the cloud that generally dulls our horizon , will be amply satisfied .

		Between these two groups is the great majority of readers of plays -LRB- like ourselves -RRB- who will find a good deal to like , and will yet wish that Mr.
Davidson	PERSON	had a little more skill in getting his real conceptions to stand out clear of all inferior material . ''

		Studies in the Psychology of Wo - man '' -LRB-
H. S. Stone & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a translation by
Georgia A. Etchison	PERSON	, from the German of
Laura Marholm	ORGANIZATION	.

		The author 's object is to ascertain the causes of the present dis - satisfaction among women , and she announces her - self as one who has '' sought to grasp the points of view and facts which are most affected by the social position of woman in the present and most recent past . ''

		The effort is sincere , but the result is a ram - bling and flighty little book , with no coherence or sustained argument .

		Like most books of its kind , it shows an empirical astuteness , and offers some interesting criticism ; but its touch is , as a rule , both clumsy and uncertain .

		In denunciation , it is at once vague and glaring ; its '' practical '' sugges - tions are indefinite ; and its main conclusion as to the destiny of woman is not at all different from that of the world in general .

		Altogether , there would seem no very good reason for not leaving it in its original German .

		During the World 's Fair year , the first volume of a `` History of the New World called America '' ap - peared from the pen of Mr.
E. J. Payne	PERSON	.

		It was in two '' books , '' the one relating the story of the discovery , and the second beginning a study of the aboriginal conditions .

		The style of the work was pleasing , and many kind words were written regard - ing it .

		After an interval of six years the second volume is at hand , bringing the history down to the period of the conquest of
Mexico	LOCATION	and
Peru	LOCATION	by Th ' \ f , r World o /
America	LOCATION	.

		the Spaniards .

		The ethnographic and linguistic characteristics of the aborigines are set forth with painstaking care , and many interesting matters are presented with minuteness of detail .

		Considering the eleven hundred pages thus far given to the
New World	LOCATION	, with hardly a beginning of the study of the effects produced upon the Old World by the discov - ery of this Western land , the question naturally arises : For what special constituency is the author writing ?

		It is doubtful whether the average Amer - ican reader will care to go much further than the extremely interesting volumes of
John Fiske	PERSON	on '' The Discovery of
America	LOCATION	, '' and it likewise seems questionable whether there is a demand for a re - writing of the history of the New World in such an elaborate way as to require over a thousand pages of detail about the pre - historic days , or rather the pre-Columbian era , before the story of the Western hemisphere is interwoven with the movements in the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	which are of vastly more importance in a well-balanced account of American history .

		If , however , there is a constituency which seeks such elaboration , these volumes of Mr.
Payne	PERSON	will prove satisfying .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Teachers of the history of
England	LOCATION	will be grateful to Dr.
Charles W. Colby	PERSON	, of
McGill University	ORGANIZATION	, for his volume of '' Selections from the Sources of English History '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- .

		The selections average less than three pages each and number upwards of one hun - dred .

		They throw interesting side-lights upon the whole course of English history , from
Julius Csesar	PERSON	to the Reform Bill , and are made with judicious care .

		The work is designed for a younger class of students than are aimed at by such publications as the '' Select Charters '' of Bishop Stubhs and the '' Old South Leaflets , '' but no student can be too young to he taught the distinction between historical sources and historical compilations .

		Recent German text-books include the following :
Freytag	PERSON	's '' A us dem Jahrhundert ties
Grossen Kriegis	PERSON	, '' edited by Dr.
L. A. Rhodes	PERSON	; ``
Stille Wasser	PERSON	, '' stories from several writers , edited by Dr.
Wilhelm Bern	PERSON	- hardt ; and '' Eingeschneit , '' by
Emil Frommel	PERSON	, also edited by Dr.
Bernhardt	PERSON	, these three are issued by
Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Messrs.
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		send us a volume called '' Aus Deutschen Meisterwer - ken , '' being stories from the mediaeval epics , retold in simple modern German by Mr.
Sigmon M. Stern	PERSON	.

		From the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	comes a tasteful edition of ''
Hermann	PERSON	und
Dorothea	PERSON	, '' edited by Professor
James Taft	PERSON	Hat - field , and embodying a corrected text .

		Lastly , the same publishers send us a ''
Pitt	PERSON	Press '' edition of '' Iphigenie auf Tauris , '' prepared by Dr.
Karl Breul	PERSON	.

		Among the many books recently issued upon the West Indian islands , the '' History '' of Mr.
Amos Kidder Fiske	PERSON	-LRB- Putnam -RRB- deserves notice for the excellence of its maps and its index .

		These render the work valuable for handy reference .

		The material of the book itself is interesting , though the subjects included in the forty chapters are so numerous as to prevent scholarly treat - ment of any one of them .

VICTOR CHERBULIEZ	PERSON	.

		There are readers not a few to whom the death of
Victor Cherbuliez	PERSON	will prove a loss altogether out of proportion to his importance as a figure in French literature . ''

		I could have better spared a better man '' will be the feeling , if not the utterance , of the many thousands to whom the long series of his novels have been an unfailing source of entertainment and delight .

		The appearance of a new book by this talented writer never brought with it the thrill of a prospective sensation , and never led , as far as we are aware , to any excited public discussion , ranging its friends and its enemies in two op - posing camps .

		But the promise of each new novel -LRB- after the first few had given evidence of the writer 's quality -RRB- aroused in the novelist 's ever-widening audience a sense of quiet antici - patory satisfaction that was , perhaps , as fine a tribute to his merit as the loud outcries which heralded the books of the more conspicuous among his contemporaries .

		No less than twenty-two novels have come from the pen of this industrious writer during the past thirty-five years .

		Most of them made their first appearance in '' La Revue des Deux Mondes , '' for which periodical Cherbuliez be - came as much of a stand-by as
George Sand	ORGANIZATION	had been during the preceding quarter-century or more .

		The list of the novels is as follows : '' Le Comte Kostia , '' '' Prosper Randoce , '' ''
Paule Mere	PERSON	, '' '' Le Roman d'une Honnete Femme , '' '' Le Grand-Oeuvre , '' '' L'Aventure de
Ladislas Bolski	PERSON	, '' '' La Revanche de
Joseph Noirel	PERSON	, '' ''
Meta Holdenis	PERSON	, '' `` Miss Rovel , '' '' Le Fiance de Mile .

		Saint-Maur , '' ''
Samuel Brohl	PERSON	et Cie. , '' '' L'Idee de
Jean Teterol	PERSON	, '' '' Amours Fragiles , '' '' Noirs et Rouges , '' '' La Ferine du Choquard , '' ''
Olivier Maugant	PERSON	, '' `` La Bete , '' `` La Vocation du Comte Ghis - lain , '' ''
Une Gageure	PERSON	, '' '' Le Secret du Pre - ceptetir , '' '' Apres Fortune Faite , '' and '' Jac - quine
Vanesse	PERSON	. ''

		A number of these novels have been translated into English , but the ma - jority , we should say , have not thus been made accessible to those who do not read the original .

		And , in our opinion , an enterprising publisher in
England	LOCATION	or the
United States	LOCATION	would find his 40 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, account in a complete uniform edition of this series of books .

		In attempting to characterize the work of
Cherbuliez	LOCATION	, it will be best to begin with a few negative statements .

		We have already said that his novels are not sensational ; this state - ment may be amplified by noting that they offer no devotion to the goddess of lubricity , that they are neither erotic nor neurotic , and that they are concerned with problems only as the novelist finds problems useful for the illus - tration of character .

		Their delineative power is , moreover , not remarkable ; it betrays the hand of the master-craftsman rather than that of the creative artist , and the entire gallery of figures includes few that remain living in the memory .

		When we compare the most studied of the types offered us by Cherbuliez with even the minor types of the ''
Comedie Humaine	PERSON	, '' this distinction becomes so obvious that it needs no argument .

		It may also be said that the novels of Cherbuliez have little or no atmosphere ; they have instead a great deal of careful local coloring , and over them all is shed the dry light of the philosophical intelli - gence .

		Essaying now a more positive sort of criti - cism , we must emphasize once more the unfail - ing interest of these books .

		The characters are galvanized into just enough of vitality to produce a fairly complete illusion when they are before us .

		They are , furthermore , arranged in extremely interesting relations with one an - other , and the ingenuity of the author in devis - ing new situations is really extraordinary .

		An additional element of freshness is provided by the great variety of scenes to which we are introduced , and by the extent to which char - acters of other nationalities than the author 's own are made to figure .

		The descriptive powers of the novelist are admirable , and we '' skip '' in reading him at the peril of missing some - thing delightful or important .

		In fact , his readers soon learn that they can not afford to '' skip '' him , for his books have almost no pad - ding , and are finished in the minutest details .

		Economy of material , united with crispness in expression and deftness in the lesser touches of his brush , form a combination of qualities that go far toward explaining his charm .

		That he is both a man of the world and a scholar trained in the processes of exact thought are two fur - ther facts that are frequently borne in upon the reader 's mind ; the former by the ease of the author 's manner when dealing with many diverse conditions of society , the latter by the minute and accurate knowledge of a great range of subjects , displayed by him without ostenta - tion as the particular occasion demands , and iu the aggregate too extensive and solid to be accounted for by any theory of cramming or '' reading up '' for the special purpose at hand .

		When we add to all that has been said the fact that a gentle irony pervades his work , temper - ing its good sense and general sanity just enough to keep it from being dull and prosaic , we have , in a measure , at least , accounted for the feel - ing with which , having read every one of the twenty-two novels , and expecting to read all of them again in default of fresh ones , we heard the other day of the death of
Victor Cherbuliez	PERSON	.

		There is little to be learned from a chrono - logical study of this man 's books .

		He was one of those writers who early make their mark , and never alter it very much after it is once made .

		His first books and his last display about the same characteristics , and his qualities , together with their attendant defects , appear about as distinctly in the '' Comte Kostia '' of
1863	DATE	as in the `` Jacquine Vanesse '' of
1898	DATE	.

		His best books are scattered among the others , and bear dates widely separated .

		We might name among them Le Roman d'une Honnete Femme , '' '' Me * ta Holdenis , '' and '' Le Secret du Pre ` cepteur , '' but it seems invidious to sin - gle out even two or three , because the others are nearly as good .

		Still , those just named may be recommended to readers desirous of making the acquaintance of
Cherbuliez	LOCATION	; the taste once acquired may be trusted not to con - tent itself with so little .

		It should be remembered , also , that
Cher	PERSON	- buliez did a great deal of writing that was not in the form of fiction .

		Indeed , his debut as a man of letters marked him out for a critic of art and a student of antiquity rather than for a novelist .

		This book was entitled '' Un Cheval de Phidias , '' further described as a series of '' Causeries Atheniennes . ''

		A later volume of what was essentially art criticism was called '' L'Art et la Nature . ''

		Cherbuliez was also a publicist and critic of contemporary society and politics , in this capacity writing regularly for La Revue des Deux Mondes , '' under the pseudonym of ''
G. Valbert	PERSON	, '' for a long term of years .

		His miscellaneous papers upon these subjects were collected into a series of volumes bearing such titles as '' Profils Etrangers , '' '' L'Espagne Politique , '' '' L'Allemagne Poli - tique , '' `` llommes et Choses d'Allemagne , '' and '' llommes et Choses du Temps Present . ''

		1899 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 41 Finally , we mention the fact that two of his novels , ''
Samuel Brohl	PERSON	'' and `` Ladislas Bolski , '' were dramatized by him , and won a certain success upon the boards .

		Charles
Victor Cherbuliez	PERSON	-LRB- to give him for once his unfamiliar full name -RRB- was born in
Geneva	LOCATION	,
July 19 , 1829	DATE	.

		His death on the first of the present month thus found him within a few days of the completion of his seventieth year .

		He was descended from a Protestant family that had found refuge in
Switzerland	LOCATION	after the revocation of the Edict of
Nantes	LOCATION	, and in
1880	DATE	reclaimed his French citizenship under the provisions of the law provided for that purpose .

		His education was cosmopolitan , begun in
Geneva	LOCATION	, and continued in
Paris	LOCATION	,
Bonn	LOCATION	, and
Berlin	LOCATION	.

		In
1881	DATE	he became one of the Forty , and in
1892	DATE	, an officer of
the Legion of Honor	ORGANIZATION	.

		Long after his resumption of French citizenship he continued to live in
Geneva	LOCATION	, where he occupied a chair in the
University	ORGANIZATION	.

		These are the chief facts of his externally un - eventful career ; his real life is revealed to us in the many volumes of his published writings .

		COMMUNICA TION .

		A REVIEWER OUT OF PERSPECTIVE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In reading the review entitled ''
Aubrey Beardsley	PERSON	in Perspective , '' in THE DIAL of
June 16	DATE	, one is forcibly reminded of the saying that the domain of art is '' a very paradise for the philosopher , '' so easy is it to make a show of wisdom , and by the use of high-sounding phrase and the exercise of skill in gliding over difficulties to lend to fallacious reasoning an air of plausibility .

		Nevertheless , he who has the temerity to pass upon the merit of a work of art ought to be very certain that his premises are sound and based upon a clearly-visioned '' fundamental metapbysic , '' and that his logic is irref - ragable .

		How often , one is tempted to ask , must the fundamental principle be iterated , before it becomes plain to every understanding , that , aesthetically consid - ered , it is not so much what is done as how it is done that makes the difference in works of art .

		Granted equal merit in treatment and handling , that work will be the nobler which has the more exalted subject : but the subject , although there may be art in choosing it , is not in itself art ; nor can the value of any man 's work as art be estimated properly by discussing its ethical ten - dencies .

		Still less can we hope to arrive at a sound conclusion by the not uncommon practice of reading into the work meanings of which the artist never dreamt .

		It is true that art , in so far as it is a medium of expres - sion , may be pressed into the service of any cause , eth - ical or other .

		Yet is it equally true that art , as such , is not ethical , neither moral nor non-moral , but aesthetic .

		Whatever relative rank as an artist we may assign to
Aubrey Beardsley	PERSON	, it must be admitted that he was an artist in the full sense of the word , and that , too , an artist who at the early age of twenty-two had already marked out a path and made a name for himself , who had so impressed his personality upon others that he had become the leader of a school and had a numerous band of followers , most of whom , be it said , only succeeded in copying the weaknesses rather than the strong points of the master .

		That many of his drawings are fantas - tically grotesque , and some of them even repulsive , no candid critic can deny .

		That this grotesquery was de - liberately meant by
Beardsley	PERSON	to be an expression of '' evil '' is in my opinion a reading into his work of some - thing foreign to his intention .

		To me it appears rather as the expression of amused delight in shocking the supersensitiveness of prudes and in confounding the ignorance of those who confuse sentiment with art , whilst entertaining those who , with him , could see the drollery of it all , and feel the charm of the refinement of line , the carefully studied composition , and the beauty of de - tail , that are after all the chief qualities in his work .

		As Mr.
Arthur Symons	PERSON	puts it : `` The secret of
Beardsley	LOCATION	is there ; in the line itself rather than in anything , intel - lectually realised , which the line is intended to express . ''

		Every young artist in the formative stages of his career is influenced to a greater or less extent by the works of other artists whom he admires .

		Even though we were not told by those who were close to him , it is apparent in his drawings that
Beardsley	PERSON	was profoundly impressed by the subtle harmony , the exquisite bal - ancing of the masses and flow of line , in the compositions of
Botticelli	LOCATION	; that he also found the same qualities in quite a different , yet related , manifestation in Japanese color - prints by the masters of the last century ; that having studied the principles upon which these works were 42 THE DIAL -LSB- .

		Inly 16 , baaed , he tried to carry them into his own productions .

		His delight and the aim which is plainly shown in every - thing he did , from the least to the greatest , is in beauty beauty of composition , of line , of mass , of light and dark as related to each other , of all the elements that combine to make up what for want of a better term we call decorative effect .

		Being a man of strong imagina - tion , be let his pencil play over the paper , and , being quick to seiie upon any accidental form thus produced , he gradually developed a style having originality as well as individuality .

		As might be expected , only a small part of the public appreciated the flner qualities in his work , although they appealed readily enough to his brother artists .

		For the public generally be became merely the producer of amusing pictorial extravaganzas ; and for the public , so far as its views about art are con - cerned , he became imbued with a lofty contempt .

		As Mr.
Symons	PERSON	tells us , many of his drawings were merely '' outrageous practical jokes , '' done simply from the de - sire '' to kick the public into admiration , and then to kick it for admiring the wrong thing or not knowing why it was admiring . ''

		Yet in this way he gained the public eye , so to speak , and not only made himself famous but secured a ready market for his wares .

		Naturally his publishers influenced him in this course by giving commissions for the most ultra designs that he could produce .

		Thus , we may be assured , was he led on .

		While
Beardsley	PERSON	's work has thus a two-fold phase , the only side upon which it can be seriously considered is the decorative .

		The grotesque features are interest - ing because of the cleverness of the drawing and the unexpected touches that made each new production a thing unlike its predecessors .

		And there is always the subtle quality which we call style : the stamp of a strong individuality .

		This often redeems what would other - wise be hopelessly vulgar .

		Then , too , his work is dar - ing , aggressive ; it forces itself upon one 's attention , and , whatever else it may be or may not be , it is never weak .

		From the point of view of decorative effect ,
Beards	LOCATION	- ley 's drawings have very considerable importance .

		Curi - ously enough , this is not so much because his achieve - ment was great , for he never really advanced beyond the stage of interesting performance and brilliant promise .

		But he had decorative feeling of a high order ; and when the force of bis idiosyncrasies shall have been spent , it will , I am sure , be apparent that he rendered a great service to the cause of art in opening the eyes of the western world to the aesthetic value of dark and light masses as elements in pictorial composition .

		Had he lived , it is more than likely that he would have contin - ued to point the way to a better knowledge of others of the fundamental principles that have been lost sight of , or so covered up as to be scarcely discernible , iu the mad rush after ultra realism which until quite recently has dominated the art movement of the present generation .

		In spite of its immaturity , I confidently predict that it is the early work of Beardsley which will earn for him the most enduring fame .

		What may be called his second manner is less vigorous , more labored , less spon - taneous .

		Failing health undoubtedly accounts for some - thing .

		Be that as it may , the second manner would probably have given way shortly to a third , and very likely a saner manner than either .

		If , on the other hand , he would have continued to produce only the trivial and bizarre , deliberately turning aside from subjects affording scope for the higher beauty which his friends assert that be bad the power to create , then the world is little poorer because his career came to an early end .

		MR.
MCCARTHY	PERSON	'S RECOLLECTIONS .

		* An English reviewer of Mr.
Justin McCar	PERSON	- thy 's '' Reminiscences , '' who evidently felt bound by his office to say something or other in dis - praise of his author , scores him for being so per - tinaciously and unconscionably good-humored .

		He admits that the book is fresh and entertain - ing really a much better book than a man of Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	's unfortunate political views and party affiliations might be expected to write ; and he , the reviewer , therefore regrets the more that Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	should prove so disappoint - ingly unable to rise above his uniform dead level of amiability and sweet reasonableness , and say something unpleasant about somebody .

		We have not , of course , quoted this fastidious critic verbatim ; but the above is about the substance of his finding .

		There is no disputing about tastes ; and we own that our English friend 's verdict struck us as being tantamount to asserting that Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	's book is im - paired by one of its conspicuous merits .

		In fact , when taking a preliminary and pleasantly anticipatory glance through Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	's pages we had been charmed to note how fairly and considerately , with what unfailing urban - ity , this active politician and journalist -LRB- prac - tical politician and daily journalist , mark you -RRB- speaks even of people who must , in the usual course of things , have spoken quite otherwise of himself and his party .

		Not that Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	is all honey , or , better , all '' blarney , '' throughout his eight hundred pages of retrospect .

		There are passages here and there that may possibly have escaped the eye of his Saxon censor : for example , his anything but flattering account of
Charles Kingsley	PERSON	.

		This reverend champion of the unestablished order of things is roundly characterized as '' about the most perverse and wrong-headed supporter of every political abuse , the most dogmatic champion of every wrong cause in domestic and foreign politics that his time had produced '' ; and his appear - ance upon the platform is thus described : '' Rather tall , very angular , surprisingly awkward , with staggering legs , a hatchet face adorned with scraggy gray whiskers , a faculty for falling into the most ungainly attitudes , and making the most hideous contortions of visage and frame ; with a rough provincial accent , and an uncouth way of speaking which would be set down for caricature on the boards of a theatre ... Since
Brougham	PERSON	's time nothing so ungainly and eccen - tric had been displayed upon an English platform . '' '

		1899 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 43 Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	's '' Reminiscences '' are not autobiographical .

		They are simply the author 's recorded impressions and recollections of dis - tinguished people he has known during his career , and they certainly go to show that from his youth up Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	has practised with skill the gentle art of making desirable ac - quaintances .

		From such prescriptive celebri - ties as
Robert Owen	PERSON	and
Lord Brougham	PERSON	down -LRB- chronologically , we mean -RRB- to Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	, few of the larger literary , political , and social fish of Victorian times seem to have escaped the sweep of his net .

		The first great personage who figures in his pages is the
Duke of Well	ORGANIZATION	- ington .

		Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	did not exactly know the Duke , but he once heard him make a speech in the
House of Lords	ORGANIZATION	.

		The speech was neither long nor eloquent ; but it was Wellingtonian , and Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	was greatly impressed by it .

		A rash peer , it seems , had in the course of debate mildly ventured to say that he feared the `` illus - trious Duke '' had not quite understood the measure before the
House	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
Duke	ORGANIZATION	rose , morally and physically , like Mrs.
Gamp	PERSON	: '' ' My lords , ' he said , striking the table with an indig - nant gesture , ' the noble and learned lord has said that I do n't understand this Bill .

		Well , my lords , all I can say is that I read the Bill once , that I read it twice , that I read it three times , and if after that I do n't under - stand the Bill , why then , my lords , all I have to say is that I must be a damned stupid fellow . ' ''

		Apropos of
Thackeray	PERSON	's alleged weakness for aristocratic rank , Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	tells a good story of a rather dense and notoriously tuft-hunting young acquaintance of his own , who also knew the great novelist , and had evi - dently bored him , as he had everyone else , with the list of his titled friends and connections .

		Says Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	: '' One day I met him at the
Garrick Club	PERSON	, and he suddenly began to talk to me about
Thackeray	PERSON	.

		Now , look here , ' he said , you always refuse to believe that
Thackeray	PERSON	worships the aristocracy .

		I '11 give you a convincing proof that he does , a proof that I got only this very day .

		Do you see this cigar ? '

		He held one out between his fingers , and I admitted that I did see it . '

		Well , ' he said , c that cigar was given me by
Thackeray	PERSON	; and do you know what he said when he was giving it to me ? '

		I had to own that I could not form any guess as to what
Thackeray	PERSON	might have said .

		So he went on with an air of triumph .

		Well , ' he said ,
Thackeray	PERSON	's words to me were these : `` Now , my dear fellow , here is a cigar which I know you will be delighted to have , because it is one of a box that was given to me by a marquis . ''

		Now what have you to say ? ' ''

		Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	admits that he had nothing to say , not even in praise of his young friend 's nice sense of satire .

		Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	devotes a few pages to Car - lyle , of whom he tells a characteristic story , in connection with the poet
Allingham	PERSON	.

		Ailing - ham , the gentlest of men , disliked nothing more than a dispute . ''

		A duel in the form of a de - bate '' was positively painful to him ; and while he had convictions , and the courage of them as well , the gentleness of his nature rendered him shy of asserting them .

		One evening , at Car - lyle 's , there was a discussion of the policy of a statesman then in office , and the sage denounced this politician and all his works at great length and with unusual energy .

		When his fury had spent itself ,
Allingham	PERSON	, who had been listening throughout in silence , mildly suggested that after all something might be said on the other side .

		Carlyle broke out with : `` Eh !


William Allingham	PERSON	, ye 're just about the most disputatious man I ever met .

		Eh !

		man , when ye 're in one of your humors you 'd just dispute about anything . ''

		Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	knew
John Bright	PERSON	well , and he once had an argument with him as to the propriety of introducing or portraying bad characters in imaginative literature .

		Every novel , Mr.
Bright	PERSON	held , would be better were there no bad people in it .

		When asked if he thought the public would take an interest in romances that were written on this plan , he contended that the public would be very glad in the end to be educated up to such a point of artistic morality .

		Confronted with the exam - ples of
Scott	LOCATION	,
Dickens	PERSON	,
Thackeray	PERSON	, and Gold - smith , Mr.
Bright	PERSON	stood by his colors , and maintained that `` Ivanhoe '' would be better without Bois-Guilbert , ''
Nicholas Nickleby	PERSON	'' without
Squeers	PERSON	, `` Vanity Fair '' without
Becky Sharp	PERSON	, the `` Vicar of Wakefield '' without
Squire Thornhill	PERSON	, and so on .

		Hard pushed with the example of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, he nailed his colors to the mast , and held that '' Othello '' would be better without lago .

		Had Mr.
Mc	PERSON	-
Carthy	PERSON	cited Falstaff , we fancy Mr.
Bright	PERSON	must have struck ; but as it was , he went on with the feeble old argument -LRB- we have seen it applied , mutatis mutandis , much more effec - tively to the '' bores '' of Messrs.
Howells	PERSON	and
James	PERSON	-RRB- that : '' The very fact that there are bad persons in real life and that we are sometimes compelled to meet them is the strongest reason why we should not be compelled to meet them in the pages of fiction , to which we turn for relief and refreshment after our dreary experience of unwelcome realities . ''

		At this point Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	did not make bold to say , with Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	, '' Sir , this is sorry stuff ; do n't let me hear you say it any more , '' but went on to stagger , as he hoped , Mr.
Bright	PERSON	with the instance of his favorite 44 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	,
Milton	LOCATION	.

		Here , says Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	, '' I thought I had got him at last . ''

		For how on earth could anybody , even the most scrupulous of '' parlia - mentary hands , '' argue seriously that '' Para - dise Lost '' would be a better poem were Satan cast out of it !

		But Mr.
Bright	PERSON	was ready with his defense : '' He argued that the demoralizing effect of introduc - ing bad men and women into novels , or into poems , was because weak-minded readers might be led into admira - tion for them , and might be filled with a desire to imitate them ; whereas it was absolutely out of the power of any mortal man or woman to imitate Satan or Beelzebub . ''

		Thinking the thing over calmly , we have our doubts as to the exact truth of Mr.
Bright	PERSON	' * closing statement .

		Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	has a capital chapter on ''
Boston	LOCATION	's Literary Men . ''

		He met
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	in
1871	DATE	, and spoke with him of Walt Whitman : '
Emerson	PERSON	told me that he bad had and still retained a strong faith in Whitman as possibly the first poet to
spring	DATE	straight from the American soil without foreign graft or culture of any kind .

		But he explained that
Whitman	PERSON	had an artistic creed of his own , which it was difficult for anyone else to accept a creed which de - nied the right of artistic ezclnsiveness , and even of artistic selection a creed which held that everything that was found in nature was entitled to a place in art .

		...
Emerson	PERSON	spoke with gentle amused deprecation of Whitman 's theory , bnt frankly owned that it made Whitman almost an impossibility for ordinary social life . ''

		Some months later , the author met Whitman himself , in
Washington	LOCATION	.

		The poet was shab - bily lodged in a garret , in a crowded building ; and at first glance Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	was rather in doubt which of the two current conceptions of him to accept the one which figured him as really a man absolutely indifferent to public opinion , to comforts and conventions , or the one which represented him as a poseur who delib - erately '' went in for '' being a penniless poet , who got himself up picturesquely for the part , and who thrust his poverty on the public as vainly and ostentatiously as
Jim Fisk	PERSON	flaunted his wealth .

		The mise en scene was perfect .

		There was the truckle-bed , the shaky wash - stand , the pair or so of rickety chairs , the shelf with the cut loaf of bread , the shabby desk and table strewn with the scribbled sheets of ill-paid genius .

		A theatre-goer '' would only have to see the curtain rise on such a scene to know that the poverty-stricken poet was about to be * discovered . ' ''

		Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	was not long kept halting between the two current opinions : '' I read the story of
Walt Whitman	PERSON	's room the mo - ment I had looked into the eyes of the good old poet himself .

		If ever sincerity and candor shone from the face of a man , these qualities shone from the face of Walt Whitman ... There was a simple dignity in his manner which marked him out as one of nature 's gentle - men ... He found good-natured fault with some of the friends who had gone too far , he thought , in sound - ing his praises throughout
England	LOCATION	; and he altogether disclaimed the idea that he considered himself as a man with a grand mission to open a new era for the poetry of his country ... Nothing could be less like the man - ner of a man who desires to attitudinize than was the whole bearing of Walt Whitman .

		... I felt sure that I now knew what
Walt Whitman	PERSON	was himself , and that the charm of real manhood was in him and in all that he wrote . ''

		.

		It may be remembered that
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, when lecturing in this country , usually reso - lutely declined to conform to the custom which often compels the distinguished foreign lecturer , after he has finished his address , to remain in the hall and undergo the felicitations and the scru - tiny of his audience .

		Not a few worthy people incline to regard this informal social function or levee at the close of the lecture as the re - deeming feature of an evening of unwonted intellectual strain , and as a gratification to which the purchase of a ticket of admission fairly entitles the bearer .

		They therefore felt themselves slighted , and even deprived of some - thing they had paid for , by Mr.
Arnold	PERSON	's insu - lar habit of eluding them by leaving the hall by the back-door or the fire-escape , as soon as he had finished what he conceived to be his part of the contract .

		This conduct on Mr.
Arnold	PERSON	's part was due , Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	assures us , mainly to his native unpretentiousness and dislike of being lionized , and not at all to supercilious - ness or to the unsociable promptings of that refrigerator-like temperament ascribed to him by the American press .

		Says Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	: `` There was nothing ungracious in the mood which prompted this resolve ; indeed , nobody who knew Mat - thew Arnold could easily conceive the idea of anything ungracious on his part ; only he was not endowed with that ' terrible gift of familiarity ' which an envious op - ponent ascribed to
Mirabeau	LOCATION	, and he knew that he never could be in his element in trying to exchange compli - ments with a crowd of perfectly unknown admirers .

		... Travelling in the
States	LOCATION	, three years after
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	had returned to
Europe	LOCATION	, I can say that he had not shown himself in any sense an ungenial or unsocia - ble visitor ; and that I came across many a household which he had gladdened by his ready and kindly accept - ance of a hospitable invitation , and by his pleasant and companionable ways as a guest . ''

		Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	's book is the fruit of a so - journ at a quiet seaside resort , where the mak - ing at odd times of uncompulsory ** copy '' was a recreation .

		THE DIAL 45 English reviewer .

		The book reflects the con - ditions of its composition .

		It is easy , rambling , informal ; and it has the charm and the defects of those qualities .

		The author has plainly given the rein to memory , and the stream of reminiscence wanders at will .

		One name , one story , has suggested another ; and the pen has followed the pleasantly devious current of the thought .

		The book might have been bettered in some ways by careful revision .

		The reader familiar with Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	's '' History of Our Own Times '' will note here and there in the '' Reminiscences '' an old story re-told , an old thought re - worded .

		The style is , as usual , rich , picturesque , and allusive rather founded on
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	, we should say , but not imitative .

		We have long regarded Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	as the prince of literary journalists and journalistic historians ; and it is pleasant to find that years have not staled his attractiveness or dulled his animation .

		These beautifully-made volumes stand very near the top of the list of the season 's reminiscential books .

		One notes with gratification that President
Jordan	PERSON	's literary style has gained , in finish as well as in preci - sion , since he went to
Leland Stanford Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity .

		One notes also , with a deeper satisfaction , that throughout these pages one is speaking who has abiding convictions as to the '' manifest destiny '' of the American people , and who is fearless to utter them in the face of one of the fiercest jehads that has ever threatened free speech .

		Not since the days of the assault in the

		In the face of such an attempt at terrorism as savors of
Russia	LOCATION	rather than of
America	LOCATION	, it is refresh - ing to read such calm and deliberate discussion of this vexed subject of American '' imperial policy '' as President
Jordan	PERSON	gives us in these addresses .

		Under date of
May 25 , 1898	DATE	, he says to the graduating class of his university : '' The war has stirred the fires of patriotism , we say .

		Certainly , but they were already there , else they could not be stirred .

		I doubt if there is more love of country with us to-day than there was a year ago .

		Real love of country is not easily moved .

		Its guarantee is its per - manence .

		Love of adventure , love of fight , these are soon kindled .

		It is these to which the battle spirit appeals .

		Love of adventure we may not despise .

		It is the precious heritage of new races ; it is the basis of personal courage ; but it is not patriotism ; it is push .

		... Patriotism is the will to serve one 's country ; to make one 's country better worth serving .

		It is a course of action rather than a sentiment .

		It is serious rather than stirring . ''

		Our heroes were with us already .

		In times of peace they were ready for heroism .

		The real hero is the man who does his duty .

		It does not matter whether his name be on the headlines of the newspapers or not .

		His greatness is not enhanced when a street or a trotting horse is named for him .

		It is the business of the Re - public to make a nation of heroes .

		The making of brave soldiers is only a part of the work of making men .

		The glare of battle shows men in false perspective .

		To one who stands in its light we give the glory of a thousand . ''

		In the address before the
Graduate Club of Leland Stanford University	ORGANIZATION	, delivered Feb - ruary 14 ,
1899	DATE	, he says : '' I hear many saying , < If only
Dewey	PERSON	had sailed out of
Manila	LOCATION	harbor , all would have been well . '

		This ssems to me the acme of weakness .

		Dewey did his duty at
Manila	LOCATION	; he has done his duty ever since .

		Let us do ours .

		If his duty makes it harder for us , so much the more we must strive .

		It is pure cowardice to throw the responsibility on him .

		... If Dewey captured land we do not want to hold , then let go of it .

		It is for us to say , not for him .

		It is foolish to say that our victory last
May	DATE	settled once for all our future as a world power .

		It is not thus that I read our history .

		Chance decides nothing .

		The Declaration of Independence , the
Consti	PERSON	- tution , the Emancipation Proclamation , were not mat - ters of chance .

		They belong to the category of states - manship .

		A statesman knows no chance .

		It is his business to foresee the future and to control it .

		Chance is the terror of despotism . ''

		In a letter to the editor of '' The Outlook , '' dated
April 26 , 1899	DATE	, after asking some search - ing questions of that jingoistic representative of the religious press , Dr.
Jordan	PERSON	thus concludes : '' Do what you will with the
Philippines	LOCATION	, if you can do it in peace , but stop this war . ''

		It is our fault , and ours alone , that this war began .

		It is our crime that it continues . ''

		We make no criticism of the kindly and popular President of the
United States	LOCATION	, save this one : He does not realize the wild fury of the forces he has unwillingly 4. ; THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, and unwittingly brought into action .

		These must be kept instantly and constantly in hand .

		The authority to do rests with him alone , and if ever ' strenuous life ' was needed in the nation , it is in the guiding hand of to-day .

		The ship is on fire .

		The Captain sleeps .

		The sailors storm in vain at his door .

		When he shall rise , we doff our hats in respectful obeisance .

		If we have brought a false alarm , on our heads rests the penalty . ''

		The whole attitude of the jingo press since
February	DATE	toward the opponents of the adminis - tration policy in
the Philippines	LOCATION	has been one of misconception and misrepresentation .

		A large number of thoughtful American citizens were of the opinion , after the ''
Maine	LOCATION	'' disaster , that war with
Spain	LOCATION	was not necessary to the liberation of
Cuba	LOCATION	from Spanish tyranny .

		They believed that the steady pressure which Presi - dent
McKinley	ORGANIZATION	had for more than a year been exerting in Cuban affairs would in good time bring its reward in autonomous government for that unhappy island .

		But when
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, driven by popular excitement and newspaper frenzy , rushed the administration into war , they gave it their loyal and hearty support .

		In due process of time the conquest was completed and military governments were set up in
Porto Rico	LOCATION	and
Cuba	LOCATION	, where in the best spirit of American institutions a class of administrators who can - not be bought or intimidated have done much to make American rule acceptable and popular .

		All that was done in those islands was done in close touch and sympathy with their representa - tive men .

		The contention of the so-called anti- imperialists is that this has not been done in the island of
Luzon	LOCATION	.

		They maintain that the same masterful and wise policy that was pur - sued in the Antilles should have been pursued in
the Philippines	LOCATION	that there should have been a policy , instead of the hand-to-mouth methods initiated as far back as the Protocol .

		They see no reason to believe that if adroit conciliation had been used with
Aguinaldo	ORGANIZATION	, as with
Gomez	PERSON	, the superiority of the
Saxon	PERSON	, mor - ally and intellectually , would have triumphed peaceably in the one case as it did in the other .

		Moreover , those among them who have a knowledge of international and political as well as of constitutional law have never questioned the full and sovereign power of the
United States	LOCATION	to perform any sovereign act open to any other nation , and consequently to annex any territory wherever its power was physically adequate , if thought expedient .

		Their propo - sition has been , not that this attempt to force a government on the Filipinos is unconstitutional , but that it is wrong .

		As Dr.
Jordan	PERSON	well says The Constitution is an agreement to secure justice and prudence in our internal affairs .

		Its validity is between state and state and be - tween man and man . ''

		It does not govern our international relations .

		Those are governed by a higher than man-made law the law of God as evolved in human conscience and human recognition of eternal justice .

		To this law the thoughtful opponent of jingoism points the American people to-day .

		He holds , moreover , that an administration which has pursued a firm and wise course in
Cuba	LOCATION	has adopted , without due reason , a dissimilar one in
the Philippines	LOCATION	.

		Admiral
Dewey	PERSON	, and more than one prominent officer of our army , have borne testimony to the political intelligence and general fitness for good government of the Filipinos ; and yet these are the people who have been forced into those occasional acts of savagery which may always be expected among those who resent injustice by a policy the very reverse of that conceded to the Cubans .

		It would seem that nearly every presumption that existed a year ago in the Malay mind in favor of the sons of free and fair and tolerant
America	LOCATION	has been destroyed , and that it has been gone about de - liberately to make these inferior races feel that the autocracy of the Yankee differs from that of the Don only in the superior military ability with which it can enforce injustice .

		If we can - not by persuasion and moral superiority induce other races to accept the better government which we are undoubtedly capable of giving them , it were better that they go ungoverned all their days .

		For the thoughtful student of American institutions must ever continue to maintain that our highest mission among the nations of the world is to set a high and mu - table example of good and fair government , based always upon the intellectual acceptance of , and enshrined in the hearts of , the governed .


JOHN J. HALSEY	PERSON	.

		DR.
HALE	PERSON	'S COLLECTED WRITINGS .

		* When the works of a contemporaneous writer receive embodiment in a definitive edition , a certain stamp of classicality seems to be set upon him , so far , at least , as the word '' clas - sical '' can be applied to literature that is cur - rent .

		This distinction has befallen Dr.
Edward Everett Hale	PERSON	in his ripe old age ; and not improperly .

		With
Colonel Higginson	PERSON	, Dr.
Hale	PERSON	stands as the last of the Old Guard whose THE COLLECTED WORKS or
EDWARD EVERETT HALE	PERSON	.

		Library edition , in ten volume * , with Photogravure Frontis - piece * .

		Boston : Little ,
Brown	PERSON	, A
Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1899 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 47 services to our native literature have been so important for its formative period .

		Dr.
Hale	PERSON	's intimate knowledge of the older
Boston	LOCATION	,
Cam	PERSON	- bridge , and
Concord	LOCATION	, his familiar association with the elder group of
New England	LOCATION	literati , are in themselves enough to make him an inter - esting figure in American letters .

		But he has been not only in it , but of it ; contributing his share to a culture-centre whose influence has shaped all subsequent development .

		Some sense of this is got as one dips into his recent book of memories of
Lowell	PERSON	and his friends , which , like Mr.
Higginson	PERSON	's '' Cheerful Yes - terdays , '' recalls so much of a time already touched with the glamour of the historic , and hence fascinating to read about .

		But Dr.
Hale	PERSON	's own contributions to our lit - erature have been voluminous and in some cases conspicuous .

		He has been , as everybody knows , a man of great and varied activity , within and without literature .

		He has written with his eye on the object , in the foreign phrase , and that object the amelioration of humanity .

		Life has , to him , meant more than literature , as it has come to mean more to Mr.
Howells	PERSON	; and literature has had its chief value as it has expressed the highest life .

		This aim , and this manifold display of energy , unite to explain his merits and his shortcomings as a writer .

		The fact that he has produced rapidly , and has not always judged his own work with the extreme rigor of the conscientious stickler for technique , is understood when we realize that he has writ - ten as a moral teacher rather than as an artist primarily .

		It is with a consciousness of the practical pressure and purpose behind his labor that he uses these words in the very charming preface to the opening volume of this beautiful ten - volume edition ; words intended to apply to another , but also , as he implies , well fitting his own case : '' If it were his duty to write verses , he wrote verses ; to fight slavers , he fought slavers ; to write sermons , he wrote sermons ; and he did one of these things with just as much alacrity as another . ''

		We all know that absolute accomplishment in one particular genre is not thus attained ; but we also know that the life and the life influence may be broader and better for that very reason .

		In this tendency to disperse himself generously according to the needs of the moment , Dr.
Hale	PERSON	is like such other of the elder writing men as
Whittier	LOCATION	and
Lowell	LOCATION	.

		Indeed , one might go further , and say that this is a characteristic of American literature , as a whole , especially in its earlier manifestations .

		It is in fiction that Dr.
Hale	PERSON	made his ten - strike : once at least he produced in this kind a representative piece of creative literature something that must always rank high amongst our short story writing .

		With a sense of this , no doubt , the publishers have introduced the series with a volume entitled '' The Man With - out a Country , and Other Stories . ''

		The famous title - tale , to which the author furnishes some valuable prefatory comment , remains a brilliant allegory , an inspiration to patriotism in the noblest sense , and an example of flawlessly wrought imaginative fiction .

		Dr.
Hale	PERSON	could afford to rest on his laurels , after doing it .

		Very interesting is his explanation of the curi - ous muddle arising from his use of the name of
Philip Nolan	PERSON	for the hero of the story a mistake he tried to rectify afterwards by writ - ing ''
Philip Nolan	PERSON	's Friends , '' included in one of the later volumes of the present edition .

		When the Doctor chose the name , he was quite unaware that it was borne by any real person ; and not till later did he discover that the his - torical
Philip Nolan	PERSON	, well remembered in the
Southwest	LOCATION	, was shot by the Spaniards in
Texas	LOCATION	in
1801	DATE	, so that the story-teller had -LRB- appar - ently -RRB- been taking unwarrantable liberties .

		The whole episode is an amusing illustration of the dangers of fictional nomenclature .

		Of the other nine short tales making up this initial volume , the best known is '' My Double and How He Undid Me , '' an ingenious idea not worked off with quite the lightness of touch necessary to complete success .

		It is just the motive for a Stockton .

		The second volume is headed by Dr.
Hale	PERSON	's most acceptable piece of longer fiction , '' In His Name , '' the sterling historical sketch which deals with the pathetic story of the Waldenses of
Lyon	LOCATION	in the twelfth century ; the balance of the book being taken up with holiday stories like '' Christmas Waits in
Boston	LOCATION	, '' '' They Saw a Great Light , '' and `` Daily Bread . ''

		The frank didacticism does not seriously interfere with the author 's freshness of invention and vigor of narrative , though it does lend his work , confessedly , an old-fashioned flavor .

		The brief '' Hands Off '' is a striking handling of the text '' From what I call evil , He educes good . ''

		The plan of the edition embraces half a dozen works of fiction and social sketches , a volume of sermons -LRB- which shows a sternly selective instinct in so steady a sermonizer as Dr.
Hale	PERSON	has been , ex officio -RRB- ; a volume of essays on social subjects ; a volume devoted to the autobiographic sketch '' A New England Boyhood '' -LRB- possessing an interest similar to 48 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, that of the books in the same vein by Mr.
Warner	PERSON	and Mr.
Howells	PERSON	-RRB- ; and a volume on The History and Antiquities of
Boston	LOCATION	. ''

		As an essayist , Dr.
Male	PERSON	's qualities are familiar .

		He has a sense of humor which gratefully re - lieves the strenuousness of his tone and seri - ousness of his purpose .

		It may be said of his writings in general that the reader is perfonv bidden into personal relations with the author : the manner is heartily confidential .

		This is always a head-mark of your true essayist .

		The new prefaces , written expressly for this edition , are one of its main attractions : unlike most prefaces , they justify themselves , for Dr.
Hale	PERSON	is peculiarly happy when talking about these children of his brain and heart .

		He hits just the right note of genial reminiscence .

		It must be a comfort to him to feel that his collected writings have thus received a permanent and handsome embodiment , for on the mechanical side these volumes , in aesthetic gray-green with gold lettering , and bold agreeable type , are a credit to all concerned .

		The beloved author 's many admirers , new and old , will welcome the opportunity to add to their libraries what we trust may not be called , in the horrid idiom , for years to come , his '' literary remains . ''

		RICHARD
BURTON	PERSON	.

		THE LIFE OF
EDWIN M. STANTON	PERSON	.

		* The chief interest and importance of Mr.
Gorham	PERSON	's two octavo volumes must lie in the history of
Stanton	PERSON	's work in the War Depart - ment .

		It was there that his great qualities intellectual power , masterful will , integrity , patriotism , tireless activity , and intense enthus - iasm enabled him to perform a service sec - ond to none during the most stormy and critical period of our national life .

		The public has waited long for this biography .

		Why so many years have passed without any attempt to tell the story it is hard to say .

		Perhaps the chief reason may be found in the fact of
Stanton	PERSON	's absolute independence , and the further fact that in the vast ant -RRB- many-sided work he had to do he had not time for the little courtesies and amenities which attract people .

		He offended many by the abruptness and unceremoniousness of his manner . ''

		He was the man who said 4 no ' for the government when it had to be said , no matter how distasteful or offensive it might be to those to whom it was addressed . ''

		man who says '' no '' is bound to be disliked by narrow partisans and place-hunters , who com - municate their petty prejudices to others .

		Of all public men , 8 tan ton seems to have cared the least about what was said of him .

		He never replied to attacks upon himself .

		But when
Horace Greeley	PERSON	, after the victories of
Fort Henry	LOCATION	and
Fort Donelson	PERSON	, wrote of
Stanton	PERSON	as the minister who organized '' those victories , he was quick to disclaim such credit in a letter to the '' Tribune '' in which he said : ' Who can organize victory ?

		Who combine the ele - ments of success on the battlefield ?

		We owe our rec-nit victories to the spirit of the Lord , that moved our sol - diers to rush into battle , and filled the hearts of our enemies with terror and dismay ... What , under the blessing of
Providence	LOCATION	, I conceive to be the true organ - ization of victory and military combination to end this war was declared in a few words by
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	's message to
General Buckner	ORGANIZATION	, I propose to move immediately upon your works . ' ''

		Men might tell all manner of lies to his dis - credit : this troubled him only because it grieved and dismayed his friends ; but such was his sense of honor that undue praise he could not bear .

		In a private letter to the Rev.
Heman Dyer	PERSON	, a friend of his youth , in
May , 1862	DATE	, giving the real facts of the difficulty between himself and
McClellan	PERSON	, it plainly and beauti - fully appears that the motives governing all his conduct of public affairs were such as over - leap time and look forward to eternity . ''

		The deep religious strain in
Stanton	LOCATION	's make-up con - stantly appears , and it was his implicit trust in the success of righteousness and justice that gave him so little patience with halters and trimmers .

		He was one of the rare crucible men , in contact with whom individuals were at once reduced to their component parts .

		His instinctive insight into men and things was what gave him his marvellous grasp of the whole situation throughout the war .

		The man who thus sees through other men , and shows that he sees through them , may be a very great power ; he is not likely to be popular , or '' by flatterers besieged . ''

		Perhaps it is well that his biography has been delayed so long .

		There has been time for many passions and prejudices to die out , and it is more possible to view the scene and its actors in their true light .


Edwin McMasters Stanton	PERSON	was born at
Steubenville	LOCATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	, in
1814	DATE	.

		His father , a physician with a good practice , died
thirteen years later	DATE	, leaving a family of four children with very limited means , so that
Edwin	PERSON	, the oldest , had to leave school and take employ - ment in a bookstore , where he remained four
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 49 years .

		He kept up his studies all the while , and being ambitious for further educational advantages he entered
Kenyon College	ORGANIZATION	at the age of seventeen ; but he was not able for financial reasons to finish the course , and left during his junior year , to enter upon the study of law .

		In
1836	DATE	he was admitted to the bar , married , and entered with energy upon what seemed his life work in the profession in which his whole ambition was centred and in which he had a singularly successful and brilliant career for twenty-five years , until he took his seat in the cabinet of President
Buchanan	PERSON	.

		The chapter detailing how the boy Stanton '' went over to
Jackson	LOCATION	'' is exceedingly read - able , and illustrates one or two characteristics that manifested themselves very early in his life .

		Dr.
Stanton	PERSON	had been a firm adherent of
Clay	ORGANIZATION	and
Adams	PERSON	, and if his son had been like most sons he would doubtless have inherited his father 's political and other views .

		But even as a small boy he had been considered self-reliant , positive , and somewhat imperious , though not combative or abusive .

		When the promulgation of
Calhoun	ORGANIZATION	's nulification doctrine called forth President
Jackson	PERSON	's immortal proc - lamation of
December , 1832	DATE	, in which he as - serted the supreme authority of the national government on all subjects intrusted by the Constitution to federal control , young
Stanton	PERSON	at once turned his back upon old political asso - ciations and enlisted with all the enthusiasm and zeal of his nature in the cause of the
Union	LOCATION	.

		This was significant , as showing his disposition to think for himself and to stand on his own feet , and his sympathy with Democracy ; for
Jackson	PERSON	, whatever his faults , was a real be - liever in the people the rank and file of humanity .


Stanton	PERSON	's career as a lawyer is admirably given .

		He steadily rose in his profession , and was engaged in many important cases , some of them of national fame .

		As a speaker he was earnest and eloquent , having , it is said , two different styles , one a vehement style adapted for a jury , while before
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	at
Washington	LOCATION	he was calm , deliberate , and impressive , carefully avoiding all exuberance of feeling .

		Perhaps no lawyer ever better pre - pared himself in advance .

		He carefully mas - tered both sides of every case , and few men have been capable of such prodigious and inces - sant mental labor .

		Activity was his delight , and when one piece of work was finished he turned to fresh tasks with the appetite and inspiration of youth .

		Being much engaged in
Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	prac - tice , he removed to
Washington	LOCATION	in
1856	DATE	, after residing successively at
Cadiz	LOCATION	,
Steubenville	LOCATION	, and
Pittsburg	LOCATION	.

		Although his legal business occupied him to the exclusion of all political interests , such a man could not but have very pronounced views on the questions then before the public .

		The supporter of
Jackson	PERSON	and
Van Buren	PERSON	, he had been opposed to nullification , secession , a national bank , state bank monop - oly , and a high tariff .

		With the defeat of
Van Buren	ORGANIZATION	, in
1844	DATE	, his political enthusiasm some - what cooled ; but in
1848	DATE	he was for the Free Soil ticket , his sympathies being openly with the Northern Democrats in their resistance to Southern domination within the party .

		In
1852	DATE
Stanton	ORGANIZATION	's interest in politics was so slight that he did not even attend the
National	ORGANIZATION	convention which met in
Baltimore	LOCATION	, although he was in
Washington	LOCATION	at the time .

		Although he took no part in the canvass of
1856	DATE	, and had no vote , being a resident of
Washington	LOCATION	, he stood un - mistakably on the side of President
Buchanan	PERSON	in his
Kansas	LOCATION	policy of 18578 , and two years later regarded the salvation of the country as hanging on the election of
Breckenridge	LOCATION	.

		In a word ,
Stanton	PERSON	was a Democrat prior to and including
1861	DATE	, opposed to slavery , but a firm upholder of the laws constitutionally enacted for its protection . ''

		That he believed the success of the Republican party would endanger the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, and that he adhered to the extreme wing of the Democratic party after it had subordinated all other questions to the protection of slavery in the rights guaranteed it by the Constitution , as interpreted by the
United States Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	in the Dred
Scott	PERSON	case , must be admitted .

		That when the apprehended danger to the
Union	LOCATION	followed Republican success , he rose superior to all party trammels , and in the cabinet of Mr.
Buchanan	PERSON	acted with high courage and the most unselfish patriotism , none can deny . ''

		On the
20th of December , 1860	DATE	,
Stanton	PERSON	was appointed Attorney-General by President
Buchanan	PERSON	.

		The review of the political situa - tion at that time is graphically given in Chap - ter XII. , in which it appears that the election of Lincoln was expressly desired and planned for by the extreme Southern leaders as a pre - text for the long-threatened dissolution of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, for which steps had been taken in advance by
South Carolina	LOCATION	.

		The disunion conspiracy , involving Secretary of the
Treasury Howell Cobb	ORGANIZATION	, Secretary of War Floyd , Assist - ant Secretary of
State Trescott	LOCATION	, Quartermaster - General
Joseph E. Johnston	PERSON	, and others , is well stated ; and one is simply amazed that treason should ever have gained such a foot - hold in the national councils , or , having gained 50 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, it .

		that it should ever have been circumvented .

		It was well known during the closing months of
Buchanan	PERSON	's term that a revolution was brew - ing ; but what was its extent , and whether it would be precipitated immediately after the election , thus taxing all the patriotism and energies of the outgoing administration , or whether the crisis might be delayed until the advent of Lincoln to power , were questions earnestly considered by
Buchanan	PERSON	and his ad - visers , as is shown in the next few chapters .

		The attitude of Judge
Jeremiah 8	PERSON	.

		Black , then Attorney-General , in
November , 1860	DATE	, as to the authority of the
Federal Government	ORGANIZATION	over a State that asserts its independence , and the way in which President
Buchanan	PERSON	bettered his instructions in his message of
December 3	DATE	, are well sketched .

		It is sickening to consider the miserable weakness and cowardice and blind - ness of Buchanan during those days while bloody treason flourished all around him .

		On the
20th of December	DATE	,
South Carolina	LOCATION	declared the
Union	ORGANIZATION	dissolved ; and on the same day
Edwin M. Stanton	PERSON	was appointed Attorney General in place of
J. S. Black	PERSON	, who had suc - ceeded
Lewis Cass	PERSON	as
Secretary of State	ORGANIZATION	and refused to accept this latter position when
Stanton	PERSON	was made Attorney-General .

		They had long been close friends , and Black was cer - tainly not calculating without his host in this matter , for if anyone could guide him and his chief out of the perils that surrounded them , it was
Stanton	PERSON	.

		Space forbids us to go into the details of
Stanton	PERSON	's work for the
Northern	ORGANIZATION	cause , which he clearly saw was the cause of his country , during the closing months of
Buchanan	PERSON	's ad - ministration .

		It is all summed up in the state - ment that his loyalty to the Union was a pas - sion , dominating his every thought and act . ''

		He set on foot inquiries as to the purposes of the secessionists in
Washington	LOCATION	and vicinity , and prosecuted them with untiring zeal .

		He made proselytes and denounced heretics .

		To Democrats and Republicans he set the example of sinking partisanship in the service of the
Union	LOCATION	. ''

		He took the lead , and was most assid - uous in creating the pressure under which President
Buchanan	PERSON	finally gave orders for the presence of troops to guard the capital against the secessionists .

		If with
Stanton	PERSON	at that time patriotism went before humanity , the same must be admitted of
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	, who was willing to place the nation under perpetual bonds to keep the peace toward slavery , and even to see it extended into
New Mexico	LOCATION	rather than see the
Union	ORGANIZATION	perish or even encounter the perils of a war for its preservation .

		Stan - ton 's presence in
Buchanan	PERSON	's cabinet was felt at once .

		Mr.
Gorham	PERSON	says he instantly changed the tone of its deliberations , and in a '' Discussion as to the binding force of a shuffling unoffi - cial agreement to leave Sumter unprotected thundered out the blunt truth to
Floyd	PERSON	and
Thompson	PERSON	, that they were advocating the commission of a crime for which , if committed , they ought to be hanged , and were urging the President to an act of treason for which , if per - formed , he could be impeached , removed from office , and punished under the penal code .

		Floyd , who bad up to that very time posed as a unionist , now appeared in his true character , and gave up the contest by resign - ing .

		Thompson soon followed , on a false pretense , and
Thomas	PERSON	,
Cobb	PERSON	's successor , followed him .

		The President surrounded himself with a patriotic cabinet , and thus escaped the fate false friends had been preparing for him . ''

		Well did Attorney-General
Hoar	PERSON	, after
Stan	PERSON	- ton 's death , picture him as standing manfully at his post during those ten dark weeks of that winter of national agony and shame , giving what nerve he could to timid and trembling imbecility , and meeting the secret plotters of their country 's ruin with an undaunted front , until before that resolute presence the demons of treason and civil discord appeared in their own shape as at the touch of
Ithuriel	LOCATION	's spear , and fled baffled and howling away .


Stanton	PERSON	's distrust and dislike of Lincoln during the first months of his administration are clearly set forth , and the story of how these two men found each other out and gradually came to see through the same glasses is one of those pleasing features which give to history the charm of romance .

		During all the time from
March 4 , 1861	DATE	, to
January 15 , 1862	DATE	, although a member of Lincoln 's cabinet ,
Stan	PERSON	- ton never once met the President .

		He was not alone in his harsh and bitter feeling toward
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's administration for its early halting movements ; and the Union Democrats were no more outspoken in their denunciations than were many Republicans at that time .

		The dis - graceful scramble for office which turned the government into a vast patronage distributor when the nation seemed literally '' lying su - pinely on its back , while its enemies bound it hand and foot , '' aroused the indignation of earnest patriots in all parts of the country .

		Men of
Stanton	ORGANIZATION	's temperament could have no patience with the policy which spent the sum - mer in explaining to weak Unionists that it was quite constitutional to return rebel blows and that the Constitution did not forbid the exercise by the nation of the law of self-preser -
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 51 vation .

		To such men , these were not open questions .

		Perhaps that part of the biography devoted to the pitiful failures of
McClellan	ORGANIZATION	is one of the most interesting in the work .

		Some may think too much emphasis is laid on
McClellan	ORGANIZATION	's shortcomings .

		But an author must be in sym - pathy with his subject .

		This is a
Life of Stan	ORGANIZATION	ton .

		Stan ton and
McClellan	PERSON	were as un - like in temperaments , characters , and methods as it is possible to imagine .

		Stanton is cer - tainly just the background against which Mc - Clellan 's weaknesses are most sharply defined , and the latter 's crookedness seems particularly perverse as seen against the absolute straight - forwardness of the Secretary of War .

		When , on
January 13 , 1862	DATE	,
Stanton	PERSON	was transferred by Lincoln from the office of
Attor	LOCATION	- ney-General to that of Secretary of the War Department , he did not accept the latter place till he had called upon
McClellan	PERSON	for advice , so says
McClellan	PERSON	in his '' Own Story . ''

		Both were Union Democrats , whose relations were known to be friendly , and
Stanton	PERSON	's resist - less energy and strong will seemed to promise an aggressive course against the enemies of the government from that time forth .

		Northern newspapers and men of all parties hailed the appointment with joy and fresh hope .

		He was a lawyer , with a knowledge of just what powers the Constitution gave to the government ; and his contention was that
Congress	ORGANIZATION	possessed the war-making power without limit , and that the President was vested by
Congress	ORGANIZATION	with full authority to do all that may be done in civilized warfare .

		It was through his influence that Lincoln at length asserted himself as de facto Commander-in-Chief of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	and
Navy	ORGANIZATION	of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		In the words of Mr.
Gor	PERSON	- ham ,
Stanton	PERSON	was gifted with the rarest execu - tive faculty , which , while keeping the main object in view , masters the knowledge of all details , divides the labor between wisely se - lected subordinates , and energizes their action by his own vigilant supervision and by holding them to a strict accountability for their work .

		He seems to have had his eye constantly on every part of the field of national affairs in any way connected with his department .

		He knew all about the vessels and forts in our command , the size of every gun , and how it was mounted ; he knew the condition of health of every officer ; he had '' feelers '' in all directions .

		He was all day at his post , and late into the night ; not infrequently morning found him still on duty .

		He went to the front , or half across the conti - nent , when necessary for investigation or con - sultation .

		He was one of those rare men who seem made of iron , and are uttery tireless and sleepless in the service of whatever cause they have at heart .

		There is not time to rehearse the thrilling scenes of the war , nor is it necessary here .

		The story never grows old , and it is set forth in this Life with spirit and fairness .

		Lincoln 's patience , which to men of
Stanton	ORGANIZATION	's type ceased to be a virtue , when , although he believed Mc -
Clellan	PERSON	had played false to the army and had contributed to Pope 's defeat , he still kept him in command , is well portrayed .


Stanton	PERSON	's fight for the country against
Johnson	PERSON	, and his death just after his appointment by Grant as a Jus - tice of
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	in
December , 1869	DATE	, with many kindred matters , are given in detail , and constitute one of the most thrilling portions of the biography .

		The second volume is largely devoted to the question of Reconstruction .


Stanton	PERSON	was the only member of the cabinet who totally repudi - ated
Johnson	PERSON	's scheme of reconstruction .

		He stated his opinions with great clearness , and never lost sight of the mischievous tactics of
Seward	ORGANIZATION	and
Johnson	PERSON	.

		When the Attorney - General gave an opinion which would have made the Reconstruction Act a nullity and re - stored the rebel element to power , the supple - mentary Reconstruction Act was promptly passed , at the suggestion of
Stanton	LOCATION	, which made it unequivocally certain that
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, as the war power of the government , must be obeyed .

		Federal officials in the South con - tinued their efforts to get rid of the military orders of commanding generals by invoking the civil power , but they were promptly advised that the military authorities were absolutely supreme .

		The President was commander-in - chief of the armies , but his champions forgot that in this case
Congress	ORGANIZATION	had relieved him from that duty .

		It was in dealing with this question that
Stanton	PERSON	overhauled the action of the gov - ernment from the beginning respecting the authority of the Secretary of War .

		This he did at the request of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	on the Con - duct of the War .

		He found that under the law the several chiefs of the bureaus in the War Department , including the Adjutant - General , were subordinates of the Secretary of War , and that all orders to them should go through him .

		This rule considerably extended the authority of the Secretary of War , and
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	hesitated at first to follow it , as did Generals
Scott	PERSON	,
Schofield	PERSON	, and
Sherman	PERSON	.

		But the care -
52	DATE	THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, f ul statement of the case , as presented by
Stan	PERSON	- ton , brought them to his way of thinking , and the rule which had prevailed for more than a hundred years was abrogated .

		From a literary standpoint , the second vol - ume is not equal to the first .

		It lacks smooth - ness , and evidently did not receive the pruning that was given to Volume I .

		This is not the final Life of
Edwin M. Stanton	PERSON	; but the work is conscientiously and sympathetically done , and it contains the material from which in time a more concise and popular biography will be compiled .

		It is a healthy and inspiring story , and one that young men especially should pon - der .

		As the friends who have sat with you about the family hearthstone have helped to create the atmosphere of your home , and as the visits of certain rarely-gifted souls seem to leave a sort of blessed influence behind which you feel long after they have passed beyond your porch , so the knowledge of such lives as this , so full of consecration and zeal and high endeavor , adds to our sense of the preciousness of our government and of the worth of human nature .

		The stamp of the
Riverside Press	ORGANIZATION	denotes that from a mechanical point of view the book is without a flaw ; and the illustrations and facsimiles add much to its interest and value .

Hearn	PERSON	's treatment of Heredity , if we may so call it , was suggested either by Mr.
Allen	PERSON	or
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	.

		We suppose it most probable that Mr.
Hearn	PERSON	was led to form his opinions by the general tendencies of the thought of
Japan	LOCATION	; and , indeed , we hope that this is the case , for , if so , we have rather an interesting coincidence .


M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	is a descendant of the Christian mystics of the middle ages : Mr.
Allen	PERSON	is a follower of
Darwin	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Hearn	PERSON	by the thought of the
East	LOCATION	comes to some of the same conclusions .

		There is probably some mutual influence ; but this is only an example of what is otherwise well known namely , that the tendencies of
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	,
Mystic	LOCATION	, and
Evolu	PERSON	- tionary philosophies are in more than minor points alike .

		It is not proper , however , to leave the idea in mind that in Mr.
Hearn	PERSON	's latest book we have merely the popular development of a philosophic theory .

		The last half of the book , the Retro - spectives , '' does consist of a series of studies of this sort , suggested by various little things which natur - ally occur in an
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	life and have their analo - gies in our own .

		And as Mr.
Hearn	PERSON	holds very strongly to the opinion that we are largely the re - salt of the known causes which in ages past have gone to our making , the first part of the book is naturally not without color of the same idea .

		Other - wise the '' Exotics '' are not connected , but are dif - ferent Japanese sketches , one of an ascent of
Fuji	ORGANIZATION	, one of singing insects , one on the Literature of the Dead , and on other matters , all very distinctive and very distinctly of Mr.
Hearn	PERSON	's quality , though some of them are more categorical than is usual with him .

		Still , all are good , for Mr.
Hearn	PERSON	always writes with that intimate sentiment of comprehen - sion that comes from his real knowledge and appre - ciation of
Japan	LOCATION	, which is probably surer than that of any other Englishman or American .

		For our - selves , we rather prefer the '' Exotics '' ; with the '' Retrospectives '' we are constantly oppressed by the existence of a pervasive , half-apparent philoso - phical theory , which we can not define and put into form , at least not without more material than is here offered us .

		But the other sketches or fantasias , as Mr.
Hearn	PERSON	calls them are by no means with - out their interest , even to those who care nothing for their philosophy .

		Messrs.
Merwin	PERSON	-
Webster	PERSON	's narrative Railroading Q f 4 .

		The gh LJne Waf , Mftc up-to-date .

		... x .

		it * i r niillan -RRB- is a good thing to read as far as the story is concerned , but we fear its moral effect can not be of the best .

		The chief figure is not pre - sented to as as a noble-minded ideal of our own time , bat as a sort of Homeric hero , more like
Ulysses	PERSON	than Ajax as suits the march of modern intellect .

		He wishes to defend the Short Line , and that end covers all means .

		He fights the unscrupu - lous bribes of his opponents with more bribes ; when they buy one judge to issue injunctions , he gets an - other ; when they hire rowdies to capture trains and stations , he hires other rowdies to recapture them .

		What a lesson for the youth of
America	LOCATION	!

		Success comes of meeting political fraud , judicial corruption , and open violence , with more fraud , more corrup - tion , more violence .

		Trifling aside , however , this is the weak part of the book :
Jim Weeks	PERSON	, the paladin of the Western railroad world , is no different from anybody else ; he is only a little more so than most .

		In other words he is not a person but an abstrac - tion .

		The creation of characters is not so easy as
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 53 the telling of stories , so that it is not remarkable that the authors of '' The Short Line War '' have been more successful in giving us a rattling account of plot and counter-plot than in really conveying to us an idea of the railroad champion , his devoted young secretary , and the beautiful maiden who wanders charming and unsustained , somewhat per - plexed though never shocked , through a jarring labyrinth of utter unmorality .

		In spite of all this , we are not much afraid of recommending the work to our readers as a
summer	DATE	diversion .

		It is to be regarded as one of the realistic extravaganzas which the present romanticism has called to light .

		We must not think of it as a transcript of life , but must look at it in the spirit in which Charles Lamb viewed the Restoration drama .

		So regarding it , we may easily enjoy the verve and cleverness of the authors , without being shocked at their lack of high principle and moral impulse .

		An pertaining
Miss Clara Tschudi	ORGANIZATION	's popular sketch truthful book on of `` Eugdnie , Empress of the French ''
Empress Eugenie	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is characterized by the same good qualities that we noted in our comments on her life of
Marie Antoinette	PERSON	.

		Mr.
E. M. Cope	PERSON	is again the translator , and English readers may well thank him for making the books of this talented Norwegian writer thus accessible .

		Miss
Tschudi	ORGANIZATION	is one of the easiest and pleasantest of narrators ; and we remember what a relief it was to read her clear , just , and unpretentious little monograph on
Marie Antoinette	PERSON	shortly after having waded through -LRB- or well into -RRB- a two-volume Serbonian bog of verbiage and labored special-pleading , in which a lachrymose and tireless Frenchman tried to make a heroine of that bad sovereign and trumpery character .

		Miss
Tschudi	ORGANIZATION	is not profound or exhaustive , and does not pretend to bs .

		She writes mainly to entertain , and she tries honestly to write the truth .

		Her book is sympathetic , yet she is aware of Eugenie 's faults ; and she does not try to gloss them .

		We do not , how - ever , think she has sufficiently emphasized the fact that the Empress was largely to blame for the heart - less , spectacular way in which the ill-starred Prince Imperial was thrust into danger whenever a scrap of political capital or cheap popularity was to be gained by it .

		The farcical '' baptism of fire '' busi - ness at Saarbruck was prompted and approved by
Eugenie	PERSON	.

		Think of setting this mere child on the firing line to be '' potted at '' by the Germans , in order that a sensational ^ efo ' 2-Napoleonic bulletin might be sent to
Paris	LOCATION	!

		Miss
Tschudi	ORGANIZATION	may be right in stating that the Empress opposed the titular Prince Imperial 's fatal expedition to
Africa	LOCATION	in
1879	DATE	; but such is not our conception of the matter .

		At all events , the adventure was at bottom a contemp - tible '' grandstand play , '' in popular phraseology ; and the Zulus were least of all to blame for its issue .

		Miss
Tschudi	ORGANIZATION	's book seems to us the most readable and the least misleading of the popular ones on the subject .

		There is a pretty frontispiece portrait in colors .

		of the The second volume of Prof.
Hast	PERSON	- in 8 > 8 great Dictionary of the Bible ''
Bible Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	.

		& & .

		-LRB- Scnbner -RRB- continues the impression made by the first .

		To it falls a number of matters among the most important in Biblical study , and the mere enumeration of subjects of some of the papers Flood ,
Galatia	LOCATION	,
Genealogy	ORGANIZATION	, God ,
Gospels	LOCATION	, Epistle to the Hebrews , Hell ,
Hexateuch	LOCATION	,
Incarna	LOCATION	- tion ,
Isaiah	LOCATION	,
Jesus Christ	PERSON	, the Johannine writings will show the influence it is certain to have upon future religious teachings .

		As in the preceding volume , the point of view is thoroughly modern , but the treatment is reverent perhaps all the more so in that no attempt is made to brush away or blink difficulties .

		Sometimes the conservative will feel this frankness is perhaps a little over-frank , as in the article upon Genealogy ; but the radical will find little to his liking , so sober is the work in all the important papers .

		Occasionally , as is natural , one feels a trifle disappointed , as in the article upon the Gospels ; and at other times it is hard to feel the wisdom of taking space for discussions of some of the more obsolete words -LRB- like '' glisten '' -RRB- of the Authorized Version .

		But there can be nothing but admiration for an article like that upon
Jesus Christ	ORGANIZATION	, in which there is maintained an almost impossible balance between caution and absolute liberty in investigation .

		It marks a long step forward in the evangelical-critical study of this most important sub - ject .

		The difference in spirit between English Old and New Testament criticism is well shown by a comparison of the papers on the
Hexateuch	PERSON	and the Gospel of John ; while those upon
Jerusalem	LOCATION	and the Herods are good examples of unbiased archaeo - logical and historical studies .

		Taken altogether , there is little but praise for the volume , and for the work as a whole .

		Study of Economics in schools .

		The series of '' Economic Studies , '' published as a bi-monthly periodical by the
American Economic Associa	ORGANIZATION	- tion -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is now in its fifth year , and num - bers a score or more of valuable monographs .

		The latest of them is the work of Mr.
Frederick R. Clow	PERSON	, and has for its subject `` Economics as a School Study . ''

		It will be remembered that the
Committee of Ten	ORGANIZATION	reported adversely to the inclusion of eco - nomics in secondary school work , and that Dr.
F. H. Dixon	PERSON	has made a notable plea for economic his - tory as a substitute for economic science in secondary education .

		Mr.
Clow	PERSON	, on the other hand , presents a brief for economic science ; and his argument is , we believe , incontrovertible .

		Both for knowledge and for disciplinary power , economics is of the highest value for young persons about to be gradu - ated from secondary schools , and Mr.
Clow	PERSON	has made the most convincing statement in behalf of this proposition that we have ever seen .

		There is a world of truth , moreover , in his statement that recent '' discussions have left the fundamentals of the science unchanged , '' and that the traditional arrangement of the subject is still the proper frame -
54	DATE	THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, work within which the teacher may work .

		This monograph should fall into the hands of every teacher of the subject in our high schools and col - K ` k ` t 'M .

		To turn from law to literature has been the recreation and delight of many a man at the bar , from the time of
Bacon	LOCATION	and
Fletcher	PERSON	of
Saltoun	PERSON	to the pres - ent , so far as English is concerned .

		To follow the thought of Mr.
Clarence S. Darrow	PERSON	through the five essays which make op the book named from the first of them A Persian Pearl '' -LRB- The Royoroft Shop -RRB- , is to find the critical faculty of the lawyer at its best .

		To
Omar Khayyam	PERSON	, to
Walt Whitman	PERSON	, and to
Robert Barns	PERSON	, Mr.
Darrow	PERSON	brings a fine sense of analysis coupled with a vivifying sympathy which proves his own enjoyment of those three writers , different as are their several appeals .

		From them to a strong plea for '' Realism in Art '' is not a long stop , and the brief for realism is argued out with good humor and a perfect understanding of the necessity for idealism as well .

		Of another and more personal sort is '' The Skeleton in the Closet . ''

		The skeleton is an uncomfortable combination of dese - crated ideals and a bad conscience , with an insistent plea for the betterment of character almost as insistently disregarded by its possessor .

		The book as a whole leaves a pleasant impression of broad and catholic interests in life .

		A capital liibfrnian jut-book .

		Pleasurable emotions not a few await the reader of Mr.
Michael Mac	PERSON	-
Donagh	PERSON	's stories of '' Irish Life and Character '' -LRB-
Whittaker	PERSON	-RRB- , among them the occa - sional joy of meeting an old friend .

		We do not mean to carp at Mr.
MacDonagh	PERSON	for introducing now and then a good old favorite ; but he really might have spared us Sir
Boyle Roche	PERSON	's bird which seems to have the gift of being in as many places in literature at once as has , say , Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	.

		Mr.
MacDonagh	PERSON	attempts in his book to do for
Ireland	LOCATION	what Dean
Ramsay	PERSON	has done in his '' Reminiscences '' for
Scotland	LOCATION	.

		He has given us , at all events , a capital Hibernian jest-book , which shows '' Pat '' as he really is , with all his delightful native wit and simplicity , and not as the caricatur - ists of the comic '' Weeklies '' paint him .

		The book is a faithful mirror of the lighter traits of Irish character , and it * popularity is attested by the fact that it has now reached a second edition .

		A iromanon a Wetter * ranch .

		The great West is the paradise of the health-seeker .

		Mrs.
Edith M. Nicholl	PERSON	's '' Observations of a Ranch - woman in
New Mexico	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is what an acute observer , on a search for physical strength , jotted down as of general interest .

		She gives us a sketch of the Mexican on his native heath , of his methods of work , and the results he achieves .

		The politics and sectionalism of the territory are sub - mitted to the caustic criticism of her ready pen .

		The enchanting scenery , the equable climate , and the special attractions of the country engage her attention through many pages .

		As long as the au - thor confines her attention to the peculiarities and conditions about her , she can carry along the intel - ligent reader ; but when she attempts to dilate on wages , education , our help , and such themes , weari - ness and monotony take the place of interest .

		The earlier half of the book is a contribution of some value on affairs in that section of the frontier .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		A reproduction of the designs made by
William Blake	PERSON	to illustrate
Thornton	PERSON	's
Virgil	PERSON	-LRB- 1821 -RRB- is sent us by Mr.
Thomas B. Moeher	PERSON	, in the form of one of the most beautiful volumes that bear his imprint .

		The mea - gre material afforded by these designs alone is pieced out by means of an introduction , some notes ,
Samuel Palmer	PERSON	's translation of the first eclogue , and the imita - tive eclogue of '' Thenot and Colinet , '' by
Ambrose Philips	ORGANIZATION	, the whole , aided by thick paper with generous margins , forming a sizable octavo volume .

		The work is , we need hardly say , a delight to the book-lover 's sense .

		Volume IX .

		of the ''
Harvard Studies	ORGANIZATION	in Classical Philology '' -LRB-
Ginn	PERSON	-RRB- is in a certain sense a memorial volume to Professors Lane and
Allen	PERSON	, who left among their manuscripts '' several papers in different stages of completion . ''

		Portraits of both men are given , as well as memoirs , Professor
Morgan	PERSON	writing of Lane ami Professor Geenough of
Allen	PERSON	.

		This matter tills about one-third of the volume ; the remaining contents are by several hands , and relate mainly to various aspects of the work of Plautus .

		The
Bostpn Public Library	ORGANIZATION	has just made an import - ant contribution to scientific literature in the publication of '' A Selected Bibliography of the Anthropology and Ethnology of
Europe	LOCATION	, compiled by Dr.
William Z. Ripley	PERSON	.

		Dr.
Ripley	PERSON	has had much learned collaboration in his task , and the result is a volume of 160 pages , comprising about
2000	DATE	titles .

		The interesting state - ment is made that all of the works mentioned -LRB- excepting possibly five per cent -RRB- are on the shelves of the library whence this bibliography issues .

		In a sense , the present work is a companion volume to Dr.
Ripley	PERSON	's forthcoming treatise on '' The Races of
Europe	LOCATION	. ''

		`` The International Year Book '' for
1898	DATE	, published by Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is '' a compendium of the world 's progress in every department of human knowledge for the year . ''

		It has been edited by Pro- fessors
Frank Moore Colby	PERSON	and
Harry Thurston Peck	PERSON	, and is an octavo volume of nearly a thousand pages .

		The arrangement is alphabetical .

		There are numerous maps and illustrations .

		The Spanish - American War , the African complications , the affairs of
Crete	LOCATION	and
Greece	LOCATION	, are a few of the subjects dealt with at much length .

		The work will be found very useful for refer - ence , and to supplement the encyclopaedias .

		We trust that it will be continued annually .

American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	send us a '' Latin Prose Com - position , '' based on Ccesar ,

		The second series of Dr.

Clarendon Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		These papers relate chiefly to the poet consid - ered as a religious teacher . ''

		The Story of the Thirteen Colonies '' and '' The Story of the Great Republic , '' both by
Miss H. A. Guerber	PERSON	, are two history readers for schools , published by the
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Milton 's '' Conius ,
Lycidas	PERSON	, and Other Poems , '' and
Byron	PERSON	's ''
Childe Harold	PERSON	's Pilgrimage , '' both edited for school use by Mr.
A. J. George	PERSON	, are the latest volumes in the '' Pocket English Classics , '' published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Volume LVII .

		of '' The Century Magazine , '' for the half-year ending last
April	DATE	, has just been sent us by the publishers .

		The recent war naturally occupies the chief place of interest among the contents , and makes the vol - ume particularly valuable as a work of reference .

		A sheaf of recent reports from the
Field Columbian Museum	ORGANIZATION	include four numbers in the geological series , and five in the zoological series .

		They relate , for the most part , to investigations of the fossils and the living fauna of the
Western States	LOCATION	, the chief exception being an account of '' The Ores of
Colombia	LOCATION	. ''

		Mr.
Henry W. Elson	PERSON	's '' Side Lights on American History '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a good book to be put in the hands of young students for collateral reading .

		It deals , simply and interestingly , with nearly a score of subjects , among them being the alien and sedition laws , the conspiracy of
Burr	PERSON	,
Lafayette	LOCATION	's visit to the
United States	LOCATION	, the Underground Railroad , and the
Lincoln	LOCATION	-
Douglas	PERSON	debates .

		Still another edition of
Fitz Gerald	PERSON	's '' Omar '' has been issued by Mr.
T. B. Mosher	PERSON	, whose imprint has come to mean so much to lovers of beautiful books .

		It is an oblong tome of vest pocket dimensions , with a preface by Mr.
Nathan Haskell Dole	PERSON	, a pronouncing vocabulary , the text of the so-called fifth edition , and the notes of the translator .

		All of this may be had for the modest sum of
twenty-five cents	MONEY	.

		Messrs.
Small	PERSON	,
Maynard , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	announce that they have acquired the greater part of the publications of
Messrs. Copeland & Day	ORGANIZATION	, who are retiring from busi - ness .

		The list is a good one , comprising books by Father
Tabb	PERSON	, Messrs.
Bliss Carman	PERSON	,
Richard Burton	PERSON	,
Miss Rayner	PERSON	, and
Miss Guiney	PERSON	, besides Mr.
Rosenfeld	PERSON	's '' Songs from the Ghetto , '' and the exquisitely printed '' English Love Sonnet '' series .

		Miss
Alice Brown	PERSON	's two volumes , '' Meadow Grass '' and '' On the Road to Castaly , '' have been taken over by
Messrs. Houghton	LOCATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, the publishers of Miss
Brown	PERSON	's recent successful ''
Tiverton	LOCATION	Tales . ''

		Mr.
Charles A. Eggert	PERSON	, of the
Chicago High Schools	ORGANIZATION	, has sent us reprints of two of his recent papers one on Moliere 's '' Misanthrope '' from '' Modern Language Notes , '' and one on Goethe from '' Americana Ger - manica . ''

		The latter is a reply to '' The Case against Goethe , '' by Professor
Dowden	PERSON	, and protests vigorously against the plea of that essay , although it seems to us that Professor
Dowdeu	PERSON	's position as an advocatus diaboli in that case is not clearly enough recognized .

		In other words , the English scholar holds practically the view of Mr.
Eggert	PERSON	, although for the special purpose of his essay he assumed a hypercritical standpoint .

		Mr.
Eggert	PERSON	's two papers are interesting to us not alone for their intrinsic value , but still more so as illustrating the tendency of our secondary teachers to do good scholarly work .

		The number of men in our secondary schools who can do such work is growing yearly , and would grow much more rapidly were our school authorities wise enough to attract scholars to these posts by giving them the same freedom in their work as is accorded to instructors in the colleges .

		What Makes a Novel Sell ?

		NO man can tell beforehand , though many can give reasons afterwards .

		But you can safely say that if in its pages some true picture of human existence is faithfully depicted , and if the emotions and sentiments included in the particular side of life treated are common to a sufficiently large portion of the reading public , that book is sure to be in demand .

		There are seven novels which , though recently published , are all meeting with such a demand at this moment , because each tells something that is true to life and tells it in an interesting way .

		`` Cromwell 's Own '' -LRB-

		81 A YEAR OF
CONTINENTAL	ORGANIZATION	LITERATURE .

		Following our midsummer custom of several years past , we have prepared a summary of the reports , published in the
London	LOCATION	`` Athenaeum , '' upon the literary output of the past year in the most important European countries .

		These reports are so valuable that we offer no apology for making this condensation for the benefit of American readers , and we take pleasure in once more acknowledging our indebtedness to our English contemporary for the material which is here reproduced .

		Eleven countries are included this year , there being no reports from
Bohemia	LOCATION	,
Greece	LOCATION	, and
Sweden	LOCATION	.

		We follow the alpha - betical order , and include in this issue the facts relating to
Belgium	LOCATION	,
Denmark	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, Ger - many , and
Holland	LOCATION	.

		The authors quoted from are , respectively , Professor
Paul Fredericq	PERSON	, Dr.
Alfred Ipsen	PERSON	,
M. Jules Pravieux	PERSON	,
Herr Ernst Heilborn	PERSON	, and
Heer H. S. M. van Wicke	PERSON	- voort
Crommelin	PERSON	.


Belgium	LOCATION	, mourning the loss of
Georges Rodenbach	PERSON	, has given the world two posthu - mous books from his pen , '' L'Arbre '' and '' Le Miroir du Ciel Natal . ''

		His name suggests that of
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	, whose '' La Sagesse et la Destinee '' is also a book of the past year .

		There have been a score or more volumes of verse , among them two by
M. Etnile Verhaeren	PERSON	.

		In criticism , there is M. Fierens-Gevaert , who has '' set himself to study the great moral and intellectual currents which influence literature at the end of our century , '' and has published his conclusions under the title of '' La Tristesse Contemporaine . ''

		There have been many books of political and social science , one of them by
M. W. J. Kerby	PERSON	, on the subject of '' Le Social - isme aux Etats-Unis . ''

		The most important historical work of the year is a history of Bel - gium by
M. Henri Pirenne	PERSON	, printed in German in advance of its appearance in French .

		Congo literature and the editing of many original documents are two departments of historical writing both of which are well represented .

		It is interesting to note that '' the German move - ment along the frontier of the Rhine provinces of
Prussia	LOCATION	and the Grand Duchy of
Luxem	LOCATION	- bourg still continues . ''

		There is a periodical called ''
Deutsch Belgien	PERSON	, '' a review in both Flemish and German , called '' Germania , '' and a five-act play , ''
Papst	PERSON	und Fiirst , '' by
M. P. Bourg	PERSON	.

		On the Flemish side , there are chron - icled several collections of verse , such fiction as the `` Lenteleven '' of
M. Stijn Streuvels	PERSON	and the posthumous stories of Mme.
Cogen	ORGANIZATION	, and such miscellaneous volumes as
M. Buysse	PERSON	's `` Uit Vlaanderen '' and M. Pol de Mont 's '' Inleiding tot de
Poe	PERSON	` zie . ''

		The theatre is not neglected , as is attested by the Flemish stages of
Brussels	LOCATION	and
Antwerp	LOCATION	, soon to be followed by one in 66 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	,
Ghent	LOCATION	, but good Flemish plays to produce in these theatres are still to seek .


Denmark	LOCATION	, we are told , '' is by preference a lyrical nation . '' ''

		Among our natural gift * are humor , a strong sense of irony , and a feeling for beauty and the contrast be - tween joy and melancholy .

		Our national character has often by our writers and poets been compared to the sea , the ever-wandering , ever-changing , and it is re - flected , as in a mirror , in our literary perfections and shortcomings , the glory of our literature being good , melodious verse , now heavy with melancholy , now care - less and unconcerned . ''

		The past year has produced '' a rich crop of poetry , '' of which the most conspicuous exam - ples are
Herr Rordam	PERSON	's retelling of the Beo - wulf story , the '' Sirener '' of
Herr Michaelis	PERSON	, the '' Portraits in Verse '' of
Herr Schandorph	PERSON	, and the '' Digte '' of
Herr Jorgensen	PERSON	, most wonderful in his particular style of
august	DATE	serenity . ''

		As for fiction , the writer feels that in the best Danish work , if not so striking as the Norwegian , `` there is something untrans - latable , something that will scarcely be felt and understood outside the borders of our small kingdom . ''

		The fiction particularly mentioned in this survey includes '' A Recruit of
' 64	DATE	, '' by
Herr P. F. Rist	PERSON	; ''
Donna Ysabel	PERSON	, '' a tale of the Peninsular War , by Fru Mailing ; and
Danske Maend	PERSON	, '' a study of low life in
Copen	LOCATION	- hagen , by
Herr K. Larsen	PERSON	.

		The tendency , in spite of such works as the one last named , seems to be away from the bare realism of a few years ago , a fact which our writer rather regrets .

		The chief Danish writer of to-day is the critic , Dr.
Georg Brandes	PERSON	, a complete uni - form edition of whose works is now in course of publication .

		Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	has written a biog - raphy of Dr.
Julius Lange	PERSON	, the late critic of art , and a pamphlet on '' The Danishness of Sleswick . ''

		The latter work is '' An address to
Germany	LOCATION	, in which the author reproaches the Germans for their system of oppression and acts of violence against the Danish in the conquered province , and compares German culture with Danish , not exactly to the credit of the former , showing how much the Ger - mans lack in different fields of spiritual culture , and how little , with their knowledge of history , they finder - stand their opponents . ''

		Finally ,
Herr Vilhelm Andersen	PERSON	has finished the first volume of a great critical and bio - graphical study of CEhlenschlager .

		`` A certain case '' has so monopolized the attention of the French poeple during the past year that literature '' has had to give place to the excited manifestations of daily polemic . '' ''

		Artists and thinkers have been living in an atmos - phere of contention .

		Who , then , could boast of retain - ing his calmness in the thick of a battle ?

		A glance at some recent publications , such as M.
France	LOCATION	's ' L'An - neau d'Ame ` thyste , ' for instance , will prove that the idealists most famous for the dile -LRB- tant < rcb & rncler of their convictions have not escaped the influence of their en - vironment .

		Writers who , if their past record means anything , seemed destined to seek nothing in life but new expressions of beauty , have shown their talents on a most unexpected side ; they have revealed themselves to be brilliant and aggressive controversialists . ''

		The playwrights are the first to be noticed among the literary workers of the year .

		The most noteworthy dramas have been the '' Nou - velle Idole '' of
M. Curel	PERSON	, the '' Berceau '' of
M. Brieux	PERSON	, the ''
Vieux Marcheur	PERSON	'' of M. La - vedan , the '' Plus que Reine '' of
M. Bergerat	PERSON	, the ''
Judith Renaudin	PERSON	'' of ''
Pierre Loti	PERSON	, '' the '' Struense'e '' of
M. Paul Meurice	PERSON	, and the '' Truands '' of
M. Jean Richepin	PERSON	.

		Of these , perhaps the most significant are the pieces of MM .

		Brieux and
Meurice	ORGANIZATION	.

		The latter , which is in verse , '' represents a return to the romantic manner of which
Victor Hugo	PERSON	was the chief master .

		The best praise one can accord to 4
Struensee	PERSON	' is to say that the writer has dis - played in it some of
Victor Hugo	PERSON	's lyric ardor . ''

		Of the play by
M. Brieux	PERSON	, we are given the following interesting comment : 44 He demands praise by his obstinate departure from beaten paths , his disdain of methods and recipes for winning the favor of the general public .

		All his pieces reveal an intention , an idea , a thesis .

		And in this con - nection the evolution our theatre is undergoing may well be stated .

		For a long while love was the sole thing our theatre lived on .

		No good pieces some years ago could do without an adulterer .

		Times have changed .

		Authors seem to be abandoning increasingly the formula of art for art 's sake . '

		They wish to speak to the public , attack the follies of the age , lash the vices of certain social classes .

		It seems as if there was a tendency clearly defined towards the drama of ideas .

		This evo - lution of drama is very palpable in the pieces of
M. Brieux	ORGANIZATION	.

		In Le
Berceau	PERSON	' his aim is to display the inconveniences of divorce .

		It is more like a disserta - tion than a play . ''

		The novel , also , has undergone an evolution not unlike that of the play . ''

		The novelists have given up studying love only .

		They have set themselves free from the obsession of the Seventh Commandment . ''

		In this connection we will call attention to Mme.
Darmesteter	PERSON	's discussion of the subject in the
June	DATE	'' Con - temporary Review . ''

		The most important novels of the year are '' La Duchesse Bleue , '' by
M. Bourget	PERSON	; '' La Force , '' by
M. Paul Adam	PERSON	; `` L' Anneau d'Ame ` thyste , '' by M.
France	LOCATION	; ''
Les Morts Qui Parlent	PERSON	, '' by M. de
Vogue	LOCATION	; '' La Terre Qui Meurt , '' by
M. Rene * Bazin	PERSON	; '' Le Ferment , '' by M. Estaunie * ; `` L'Arae d'un Enfant , '' by
M. Jean Aicard	PERSON	; and '' Devant le
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 67 Bonheur , '' by
M. Jean Thorel	PERSON	.

		Of
M. de Vogue	ORGANIZATION	's book we read that the author '' Is not afraid to approach serious social problems which agitate minds of to-day .

		He introduces us to the Palais Bourbon , which he frequented as a deputy during one legislature . '

		He has brought away melancholy reflec - tions .

		Still , it appears that he does not regret his excur - sion into the world of politics , since he returns to it with a book like '
Les Morts Qui Parlent	ORGANIZATION	. '

		In this new novel , which contains a delicate love interest closely welded with political intrigue ,
M. de Vogiie	PERSON	' shows once more his mastery , his unsurpassable talent for writing .

		Here is to be found the richness of style in which splendid images enchant you , enlivened by a breath of strong eloquence which bears up the ideas bravely .

		It is the book of a poet , an artist , an original and deep thinker .

		Politics , too , are touched on in ' L'Anneau d'Ame ` thyste , ' the third volume of the series which M.
France	LOCATION	has called '
Histoire Contemporaine	PERSON	, ' which is a mordant satire on our faults and vices .

		The best thing in the book , the quite first-rate part , is contained in the comic scenes .

		M.
France	LOCATION	is an admirable writer of comedy .

		In his latest novel he shows himself a little more bitter and pessimistic than usual ; but to set against this he presents readers with a sympathetic being , and that is a happy novelty ! ''

		M. Estaunie 's '' Le Ferment '' '' Might be called a social novel .

		By ferment ' he means the restless , ardent intelligence of sons of work - men and peasants who have been taught too much , and had longings and desires unknown to their fathers de - veloped in them .

		M. Kstaunid studies the social crisis .

		He uses his realistic talent with moderation in order to display the debasement of those who are mixed up in the desperate struggle of ambitions and appetites . ''

		The French poets have not been idle , although nothing very noteworthy has been done by them .

		Mention is made of '' La Chanson de la
Bre	ORGANIZATION	- tagne , '' by
M. A. Le Braz	PERSON	; of '' Les Poemes de 1 ' Amour et la Mort , '' by
M. Lebey	PERSON	; of `` La Chanson des Hommes , '' by
M. Maurice Magre	PERSON	; of '' Artiste et Poete , '' by
M. Jean Bach-Sisley	PERSON	; of ''
L'Ideale Jeunesse	PERSON	, '' by
M. Montier	PERSON	; and of '' Paysages et Paysans , '' by
M. Maurice Rol	PERSON	- linat , who '' has been styled the pupil of George Sand and
Edgar Poe	PERSON	. ''

		There has also been published '' Les Annees Funestes , '' a posthu - mous volume by Hugo .

		In literary history and criticism there are such books as the new series of '' Impressions de Theatre , '' by
M. Jules Lemaitre	PERSON	; the ''
Racine	LOCATION	, '' by
M. Larroumet	PERSON	; the ''
Essai	PERSON	sur Goethe , '' by
M. Edouard Rod	PERSON	; and the '' De
Dumas	PERSON	a Rostand , '' by M. Au - guste Filon .

		In the domain of a stricter scholar - ship , there are
M. Masson	PERSON	's `` Josephine de Beauharnais , ''
M. Houssaye	PERSON	's ''
Waterloo	LOCATION	, ''
M. Demolins	PERSON	's '' Les Franc , ais d'Aujourd ` hui , '' and '' L'Education Nouvelle , ''
M. Fouillee	PERSON	's `` Les Etudes Classiques et la Democratic , '' and
M. Laffite	PERSON	's '' Le Faust de Goethe . ''

		A book not easily classified , but which must be mentioned , is
M. Coppee	ORGANIZATION	's '' La Bonne Souf - france , '' in which the author , '' in a familiar and often eloquent style , tells the occasion and influences which resulted in his return to the Faith . ''

		Concluding his review , the writer says : '' In
France	LOCATION	there are no longer literary schools , though it is easy to recognize c tendencies . '

		It would be a para - doxical and most unjust thing to say that all the literary schools which have come forth and had their day of glory in our times have gone bankrupt .

		They have undergone the law of evolution ; they have disappeared in obedience to the manifestations of a new code of lit - erary aesthetics , or , in plain terms , because the public have gone after new gods .

		Certainly
M. Zola	PERSON	, the head of the realistic school , and
M. Bourget	PERSON	, the undisputed master of the psychological novel , have not stopped writing -LRB- and of that we are very glad -RRB- ; but who of the young novelists makes their methods his model ?

		There are no more schools because no more masters are wanted in literature .

		The first act of a writer born into the literary world is to declare his independence , and assert , as best he can , his autonomy .

		In the novel , in poetry , history , philosophy , criticism , isolation is the thing , and everyone is at least an individualist . ''

		The past year in
Germany	LOCATION	witnessed the death of
Bismarck	LOCATION	, and gave us his memoirs , ''
Bismarck	PERSON	, the Man and Statesman . '' ''

		His monument is composed of no perishable mate - rial , and its construction reveals his individuality , even in the smallest details .

		Everything in this book is per - sonal .

		The five-and-twenty years and more of German and other than German history became a mirror of his personality .

		Actions and men appear as he saw them , and he allows them to be rated at no other value ... He disliked fine phrases , and the result was a feeling of distrust for mere phrase-making in literature .

		His politics were concerned with actualities ; literature , too , was reared on a basis of fact .

		Fidelity to nature be - came the catchword .

		Active , unsentimental characters rose in general esteem ; the sentimental went out of favor .

		And as so often happens , in the attempt to root out the weeds the flowers too suffered .

		Not only senti - mentality , but also noble and right feeling , or at any rate its expression , was tabooed .

		The young literature of the eighties made no mention of feeling .

		It expresses a skepticism which , however , yielded humbly before the advent of reality , one in which the peculiarity of
Bis	ORGANIZATION	- marck 's personality had its full share . ''

		The death of
Theodor Fontane	PERSON	also serves to mark the past year . ''

		He lived just long enough to write a charming little ode on the statesman 's death , then he too passed away .

		Only a few weeks before his death his autobiographical sketches ' Von Zwanzig bis Dreissig ' appeared .

		Before his last novel ' Der
Stechlin	PERSON	' left the press we had stood beside his grave .

		It is impossible to make those of another nation understand what
Fontane	PERSON	was and still is to us .

		He was distinctly a North German , Prussian , even Brandenburg writer , and even in
Vienna	LOCATION	he attracted little notice .

		But we loved him , and named him the best among us .

		He depicted the men whom we know as we see or should wish to see them .

		He was a distinct realist , but his realism had a subjective character . ''

		The most important works of pure literature 68 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, have been two plays
Herr Hauptmann	PERSON	's ``
Fuhrmann Henschel	PERSON	'' and
Herr Sudermann	PERSON	's ** Die Drei Reiherfedern . ''

		The former is thus described : ''
Henschel	PERSON	's wife when dying forces him to promise that after her death he will not marry the girl who U at this time in their service .

		He promises , and his wife dies .

		But his household can not get on without a woman , the child needs a mother , and he marries the servant after all .

		Then she deceives him , makes his life a bur - den , and stirs up strife between her husband and his friends and neighbors .

		One day at the inn he has a quarrel with his brother-in-law , who tells him the truth about his wife .

		He demands proofs and sends for his wife , and she can find no defence .

		Then the truth flashes on him either he or bis wife must die .

		So he goes away and hangs himself . ''

		As
Herr Sudermann	PERSON	's first novel was called **
Frau Sorge	PERSON	, '' his latest play might well be styled ''
Frau Sehnsucht	PERSON	. ''

		It leads
Sudermann	PERSON	back to the moods of his youth , and restores the elements of lyric feeling and person - ality which were so regrettably wanting in his recent successful plays .

		All the same , the new play is a failure ; it lacks clearness , and with it scenic effective - ness and human interest .

		But the element of longing has been fathomed to its depths .

		It is this unending desire that drives the young Northern hero Prince
Witte	PERSON	ceaselessly about the world ; it is the eternal tragedy of the delusion of desire that prevents him , when once he has attained the idol of his longings , from recognizing his dream , and he casts it from him to pur - sue the phantom once more .

		Other plays are '' Die Gefahrtin '' and ''
Das Gemachtniss	PERSON	, '' both by
Herr Arthur Schnitz	PERSON	- ler ; '' Die Hoohzeit der Sobeide , '' by
Herr Hugo	PERSON	von Hof mannsthal ; '' Herostrat , '' by
Herr Ludwig Fulda	PERSON	; '' Die Heimathslosen , '' by
Herr Max Halbe	PERSON	; and ''
Gewitternacht	PERSON	, '' a patriotic tragedy of the Silesian wars , by
Herr Ernst von Wildenbruch	ORGANIZATION	.

		In poetry , there are three small volumes by
Herr Stefan George	PERSON	, who is compared with
Rossetti	PERSON	.

		In fiction , a new volume of stories by
Herr Paul Heyse	PERSON	is called `` Der Sohn Seines Vaters . ''

		Other fiction includes two volumes of stories by
Frau Lou Andreas-Salome	PERSON	' ,
Herr Raabe	PERSON	's ''
Hastenbeck	PERSON	, '' a story of the Seven Years ' War ,
Herr Wilbrandt	PERSON	's ``
Vater Robinson	PERSON	, ''
Fraulien Bohlau	PERSON	's Halbtier , ''
Fraulein Fra	PERSON	- pan 's `` Wir Haben Kein Vaterland , ''
Herr Lindau	PERSON	's `` Agent , '' and
Herr Spielhageu	PERSON	's Urn-ill . ''

		Finally , a book of the deepest interest is
Frau von Meysenbug	PERSON	's ''
Lebensa	PERSON	- bend einer
Idealistin	PERSON	. ''

		`` Malvida von Meysenbug , the friend of
Richard Wagner	PERSON	,
Nietzsche	LOCATION	, and
Mazzini	PERSON	, was also an advanced woman .

		This noble lady , who freed herself from the narrow conditions of her home , and lived in
London	LOCATION	among the political exiles , helping on their schemes , also turned her thoughts to female education , and never shrank from entering the lists for her ideas .

		But this 1 Lebensabeud , ' the sequel to the Meinoiren eiuer Ideal - istin , '' is a book of peace .

		She presents charming pic - tures of her intercourse with
Wagner	PERSON	and
Nietzsche	PERSON	,
Mazzini	PERSON	and Liszt ; but what is specially charming abuut this book , in spite of its somewhat highflown manner , is the evidence that she has attained contentment and inward freedom in herself . ''

		In the report upon Dutch literature , the first place is given to
Heer Paap	PERSON	's anti-Semitic novel , ``
Vincent Haman	PERSON	, '' which is '' a violent attack on the leaders of modern literature . ''

		There is not much good original work to men - tion .

		Volumes of verse are Dr.
van Eeden	PERSON	's `` Enkele Verzen , ''
Helene Lapidoth-Swarth	PERSON	's ''
Stille Dalen	PERSON	, ''
Heer Albert Verwey	PERSON	's '' De
Nieuwe Tuin	PERSON	, '' Mr.
G. C. van	PERSON	' t Hoog 's ''
Ge	ORGANIZATION	- luk , '' and Miss Reyneke van
Stuwe	PERSON	's '' Impres - sies . ''

		The stage has witnessed two important productions
Breero	PERSON	's `` Spaansche Brabanter '' and Mr.
H. Heyermans	PERSON	's '' Ghetto . '' ''

		From poetry to prose Dr. van den Bergh van Eys - inga has built a golden bridge with bis '
Boek van Toevertrouwen	PERSON	, ' an elaborate specimen of lyric prose , the work of a clergyman under strong Biblical infiuence .

		It breathes soothing confidence and hope , real faith and firm conviction . ''

		The most erudite and entertaining book of the year is Professor van
Hamel	PERSON	's ''
Letterkundig Leven	PERSON	van Frankrijk . ''

		Professor
P. L. Mul	PERSON	- ler 's '' great popular history , *
Onze Gouden Eeuw	PERSON	, ' describing the rise , growth , and the beginning of decay of
Holland	LOCATION	at her best , is now completed .

		The last volume , which deals with the government , life , religion , and morals of our ancestors , is perhaps the most interest - ing of the three . ''

		Last of all , we mention two essays in ecclesiastical history , ''
Rome	LOCATION	en de Geschiedenis '' and '' Petrns en
Rome	LOCATION	, '' both by Professor
Bolland	PERSON	of
Leyden	LOCATION	, which have given rise to a violent controversy between the conservative and advanced schools of religious thought .

		COMMUNICA TION .

		THE PROBLEM OP CHILDREN 'S BOOKS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of
THK	ORGANIZATION	DIAL . -RRB-

		Your recent suggestive article upon Boys and -LRB- iirls and Books , referring to the differences in the literary tastes of high-school pupils , leads one to inquire whether these differences are not due in a greater measure to the pupil 's earlier training than to his native bias .

		The mind of a child is formed as his muscles are formed by food and exercise ; and his earliest mental pabulum is supplied by the jingles of the nursery , and by the classic tales which are selected , it is to be hoped , by a judicious mother .

		At this age he becomes acquainted with Mother Goose , and there is nothing better for him , provided always it is the real simon-pure Mother Goose ,
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 69 and not the miscellaneous stuff which masquerades in cheap editions under that name .

		The parent must not think that any story which will amuse a child is useful .

		The individual taste has not at this period of develop - ment become pronounced ; the child will accept any - thing eagerly ; a story is a story .

		But the influence of the stories which are told him is deep and lasting .

		If he is fed upon tales of ogres and giants who eat up little boys , a taste is formed which will continue to demand extravagant and blood-curdling fiction .

		Jack the
Giant Killer	ORGANIZATION	is the logical antecedent of
Jack	PERSON	the Indian Killer and
Jack the Ripper	PERSON	, which our children see a little later upon the news-stands , more 's the pity .

		We sometimes ask why these outrageous yellow-covered tales are written ; but the explanation is quite easy .

		There is a demand for them ; and we should see to it that the demand is not fostered by the tales which our children hear from their nurses in the days before the little ones can read for themselves .

		The next important step in the formation of the child 's taste is taken when he finds out the meaning of the printed word and wanders away from his school reader to test for himself his newly acquired powers .

		This is the point at which the child particularly needs help .

		Doubtless some latitude should be allowed to him in the selection of his reading matter .

		If he himself chooses one from a half-dozen books , all of which are equally good , the chances are that he will better enjoy the read - ing of it and will get more real good from it than if it were presented to him alone as something to be read because of the good it would do him .

		Do not make his reading a duty , but let it be a privilege and a pleasure .

		He may prefer
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	to Pilgrim 's Progress , and if he does he should be allowed to read it .

		But beware how widely his choice is allowed to extend .

		Fruits are good for children , but there are unripe fruits and there are partly decayed fruits which are not good .

		The average parent will be quite careful as to what his children are putting into their stomachs , but is apt to be equally careless as to their mental fare .

		The boy-baudit , wild-west , sensational stories of the news-stands , to which reference has already been made , are not , after all , the most dangerous species of chil - dren 's literature .

		They are so glaringly bad that par - ents instinctively scent their presence and banish them from the household .

		Their influence is happily becom - ing limited to those homes in which the parents them - selves are not above the moral standard of the tales , and in such homes there is little chance for the growth of a pure literary taste or a high moral character .

		It will be observed that the influence of all literature is felt along these two lines , the jesthetic and the moral : that which affects the taste and that which affects the character .

		While these remarks apply chiefly to the aesthetic influence , the two are so blended that it be - comes quite impossible to avoid reference to the moral influence as well .

		That which we love , we are .

		The most dangerous class of children 's literature is that in which sensationalism is respectably clothed .

		There are stories quite as bad in their influence as the border-ruffian type , but more refined in their setting .

		The boys and girls move in good society , but they are always getting into the most impossible situations and having the most startling adventures , hair-breadth escapes , encounters with burglars , and all that sort of thing .

		These stories appear in reputable children 's magazines , and are interspersed with items of useful information science , history , and biography .

		The story is inserted to make the magazine popular ; and it answers its purpose .

		In the family of my friend A , three well-known children 's periodicals are taken and read .

		Several days before the time for the appearance of each issue , the children are in a fever of excitement ; and when the paper at last appears , everything is dropped until the fate of the hero of the continued story is ascer - tained .

		In this family there is no library worthy of the name .

		The periodicals already referred to supply all the reading matter for which the children care , or for which they have time after their school duties are fulfilled .

		But while this sugar-coated sensationalism is bad , there is another class of children 's literature which is quite as objectionable .

		I refer to the sentimental stuff which is written in the name of religion and morality , but which is effective only in vitiating the taste , weak - ening the intellect , and giving false views of life .

		It appears notably in the '' children 's column '' of certain religious papers , and in books intended for
Sunday	DATE	- school consumption , which , happily , the best
Sunday	DATE	- schools have long ago repudiated and cast out .

		It is one of the most significant facts of modern life , that a surfeit of periodical literature , both juvenile and adult , is operating against the reading of books and the formation of libraries .

		The magazine has its place , but it also has its limitations ; and we should lead our children to understand that , after all , the vital and per - manent literature is that preserved for them in good books .

		Let every child have his little book-case in the nursery , or , better yet , a shelf in the library which he may call his own .

		Let him be encouraged to read good books and to care for them .

		He will then come to feel the friendship with them which is the greatest joy of the literary life .

		A good book presented to a child on each succeeding birthday a book chosen wisely with respect to the child 's tastes and abilities , but of sterling worth will soon put him in possession of a library which will be a lasting source of strength and satisfaction .

		It is a mistake to think that the child must be continually supplied with fresh reading matter , that a book once read is finished .

		Indeed , the strong intellects of the last century are those which have been nourished in childhood upon a few good books , read and re-read until the thought and style became a part of the read - er 's permanent possession .

		Nor does a child lose interest in a good book after a single reading .

		What boy ever tired of Gulliver 's Travels ?

		Such books as those of
Kingsley	PERSON	, Church , and
Jane Andrews	PERSON	, Lamb 's Tales from
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and
Adven	PERSON	- tures of
Ulysses	LOCATION	, the fairy tales of
Andersen	PERSON	and
Grimm	PERSON	, .

		<
Esop	ORGANIZATION	's Fables ,
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	and the Swiss Family
Robinson	PERSON	, Pilgrim 's Progress ,
Franklin	PERSON	's Auto - biography ,
Tom Brown	PERSON	at Rugby , and the stories of
Scott	PERSON	and
Dickens	PERSON	, all these are genuine classics , and they never grow old .

		Then there is a multitude of new books written for children by men and women who love and understand the needs of child-life .

		Never was there a wider range of selection , and never a time when the possession of children 's libraries was so inexcusable .

		While nothing can quite take the place of the library in the home , the best substitute for it is the library in the school .

		Educational sentiment is alert upon this subject , and the growth of school libraries during the past decade is a hopeful sign , not only of a healthier literary taste , but of a sounder morality in the men and women of the next generation .

		DANTON AS MAN AND LEADER .

		* A writer of biography is fortunate if his hero lived in a period of tragic events , when the problem of public conduct was complex and baffling ; for it is singularly interesting to study the behavior of character subjected to extraor - dinary strain .

		The men of the French Revolu - tion certainly fell upon such times .

		It was not theirs simply to fight for recognized liberties against an encroaching government , as the English , and more recently the Americans , had fought before .

		When these Frenchmen attempted the task , the very foundations of society crumbled beneath their feet , and while they looked about for a footing they saw all
Europe	LOCATION	advancing in arms toward their fron - tiers .

		Beset by fears , jealousies , and hatreds , they were driven to form opinions while stand - ards of judgment were changing ; they must act , though the objects which
France	LOCATION	sought to-day might be abandoned tomorrow .

		To change the direction of the thought if one would penetrate the secret of the
Revolu	PERSON	- tion the surest path is along the line of just such individual experience , following ade - quately tested men into the '' welter , '' and inter - preting its nature and tendencies by its effects upon them .

		It is strange , therefore , that so few biographies of the Revolutionists have been written , even in
France	LOCATION	.

		Without prejudging the two volumes under review , it may be said that no satisfactory life of
Danton	PERSON	has yet ap - peared .

		The works of Aulard ,
Robinet	PERSON	, and
Bongeart	PERSON	are rather studies of aspects of his life than complete descriptions of it .

		They are , moreover , chiefly attempts to meet the charges which have always been brought against him .

		Mr.
Beesly	PERSON	and Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	, who seek to bring to English readers the results of the later inves - tigations in
France	LOCATION	, are both enthusiastic ad - mirers of the great Cordelier .

		Mr.
Beesly	PERSON	's book is distinctly apologetic from beginning to end , although a biographical study with apology as its dominant note is itself a damag - ing criticism of its hero .

		This is not altogether Mr.
Beesly	PERSON	's fault , because any bold strong man who rose to leadership during such days could hardly come through without leaving some memories to trouble zealous eulogists .

		LIFE or DANTON .

		87
A. H. Beesly	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	: Long - mails ,
Green	ORGANIZATION	, A
Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was first as a dramatic poet , in his ''
Danton	PERSON	and Other Verse , '' that Mr.
Beesly	PERSON	seems to have approached his hero .

		In this new vol - ume he shows a wide familiarity with French researches , but he has apparently paid little attention to the documentary sources of inform - ation , aside from the '' Moniteur , '' which he has used for
Danton	ORGANIZATION	's speeches .

		And his use of the '' Moniteur '' is not critical , else , for ex - ample , he would not have fallen into the com - mon error of attributing the phrase '' Plarons la terreur a 1 ` ordre du jour '' to
Berrere	LOCATION	, who merely quoted it from an orator of the Com - mune in
September , 1793	DATE	.

		Consciously or unconsciously , Mr.
Beesly	PERSON	has sought to palliate the darker deeds of the Revo - lution by setting everything of the Old Regime in a dismal light .

		He begins with a miscel - laneous assortment of evils and an incredible story or two .

		He says
Louis XIV	ORGANIZATION	.

		left
France	LOCATION	'' two and one-half milliards of debt , '' and that the Regency added to this 750 millions .

		With - out another word of explanation he remarks , '' But the Queen went on gambling , '' as if the years from
1723	DATE	to
1774	DATE	were dropped out entirely .

		When he reaches the overthrow of the monarchy ,
August 10	DATE	, instead of a word of pity for the poor old king , he gathers from the gossip of the memoir writers four pages , giving the impression that
Louis	PERSON	was a boorish , greedy , cruel nobody .

		Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	's '' Study '' of
Danton	PERSON	is a more important contribution to the subject , for by his own independent investigations he has been able to control and occasionally to supplement his French predecessors .

		His treatment reveals vigorous thinking and clear conceptions of many of the characteristic features of the great struggle .

		There are passages of remarkable de - scriptive power , sometimes rising to eloquence .

		This is particularly true of the chapter on the death of
Danton	LOCATION	.

		Here and there a phrase gathers the significance of all the varied inci - dents of a whole situation .

		But besides these good qualities there are certain surprising de - fects .

		And , first , inaccuracies .

		Such things as '' jerrymander , '' '' Golier '' for Gohier , and '' suppliants '' for suppleants , are probably mere misprints .

		But on page 218 he says
Danton	PERSON	opposed ,
April 10	DATE	, the '' prosecution of those who sent a petition from the
Halle	PERSON	aux Blcs for the resignation of Roland . ''

		Now Roland had resigned
January 22	DATE	.

		Moreover , this pe - tition was not sent in ; it was discovered by 1 V t ion while it was being circulated , who asked that its authors be prosecuted .

		Danton 's inter -
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 71 vention was accidental and had no significance , for he had not heard the first part of the peti - tion , in which the offensive words occurred , and misunderstood the intent of the discussion .

		A cursory reading of the Moniteur would have set the author right .

		A similar blunder occurs on page 179 , in speaking of Gohier 's report on the `` civil list . ''

		Here Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	was misled by a statement in one of
Aulard	ORGANIZATION	's articles in the '' Revolution frangaise . ''

		The formal report did not come out
August 18	DATE	, as Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	says , but on
September 16	DATE	.

		However ,
Gohier	PERSON	had outlined the discoveries in
August	DATE	, though not for the first time on the date Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	suggests , but several days earlier .

		M. Aulard quoted only from ''
Moniteur XIII.	PERSON	, 445 , '' though he might have found practically the same statements in an earlier reference , ''
Moniteur XIII.	PERSON	, 430 . ''

		In Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	's footnote the reference is ''
Moniteur XII.	PERSON	, 445 . ''

		Errors of this sort are of minor importance .

		But when Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	attempts to answer the question concerning the consequences of Valmy , '' Why then did the King of
Prussia	LOCATION	retreat ? ''

		he becomes puerile .

		He gives the credit to
Danton	PERSON	which belongs to Dumouriez , confuses dates and incidents , and sacrifices clearness to mere phrasing .

		What can anybody make out of a sentence like this , in reference to D'Eglan - tine 's mission to compose the jealous ambitions of
Kellerman	PERSON	and Dumouriez : '' That foolish man , D'Eglantine , followed him , but his folly was swallowed up in the wisdom of
Danton	LOCATION	, who sent him , '' etc. .

		It is impossible here to more than allude to Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	's inadequate treatment of the
First Committee of Public Safety	ORGANIZATION	, of which
Danton	PERSON	was the most influential member .

		He seems to have laid little emphasis in his studies on the records and correspondence of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	itself , edited by
M. Aulard	ORGANIZATION	.

		Otherwise he would hardly have so greatly over-estimated the importance of
Berrere	ORGANIZATION	's report in behalf of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	, presented
May 29	DATE	.

		He has printed long extracts from this iii an Appendix , under the erroneous impression that it had never been printed elsewhere .

		Vigorous and clear as Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	's style is in many passages , it occasionally becomes meta - phorical , oracular , and bombastic .

		He remarks that
Danton	PERSON	was chary of metaphor , a virtue he might have himself better appreciated .

		A few rhetorical curiosities are worth mentioning . ''

		When
spring	DATE	had melted their enthusiasm '' almost defies analysis .

		This seems a little thing compared with the following , apropos of the Flight to Varennes : '' France was also afraid ... She feared the divine sunstroke that threatens the road to
Damascus	LOCATION	.

		In that passage which was bounded on either side by an abyss , her feet went slowly , one before the other , and she looked backward continually .

		In the twisting tides at night her one anchor to the old time was the monarchy .

		Thus when
Louis	PERSON	fled the feeling was of a prop broken . ''

		Here is a delightful going and coming of the fancy from sacred to profane , from land to sea , and back again .

		In another case the author is obliged to escape from his metaphor argumenta - tively , and by main strength , as it were .

		A quarrel between
Paris	LOCATION	and the departments he says '' would have been a fight between the members and the brain , and the brain would have died fighting , leaving a body dead because the brain had died . ''

		The anatomical impos - sibilities of such an affair quite make one forget
Paris	LOCATION	and the departments and
Danton	PERSON	himself , so that one must finally go back to find what it is all about .

		Both writers under consideration would have made
Danton	PERSON	's earlier career more comprehen - sible had they explained at somewhat greater length the municipal history of
Paris	LOCATION	in
1789	DATE	and
1790	DATE	.

		This is not so difficult to do , now that many of the records have been edited .

		And without such an explanation one starts out with the impression that
Danton	PERSON	was merely a noisy demagogue , though with greater legal acu - men and more ability than some of the others .

		The word ''
September	DATE	'' is after all the ugli - est obstacle for a Danton biographer to sur - mount .

		Few writers now accuse him of direct complicity in the massacres .

		But some years ago , when it was proposed to name a new street near
Danton	LOCATION	's house after the great
Revolu	PERSON	- tionist , there was a lively debate in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, and the distinguished historian ,
M. Wallon	LOCATION	, refused to be convinced that
Danton	PERSON	was not their real author .

		He suggested six panels for the pedestal of a Danton statue : '' Massacre de 1 ` Abbaye , Massacre des Carmes ,
Massacre de la Force	ORGANIZATION	, '' etc. .

		Both Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	and Mr.
Beesly	PERSON	advocate the theory that , in the perilous situation of
Paris	LOCATION	,
Danton	PERSON	did not dare antago - nize the bloodthirsty radicals who hounded on the mob to these murders .

		This is according to the evidence or rather the absence of evi - dence , but there is a suggestion in a part of the record of the Commune on the first day of the massacres which is significant .

		The Com - mune sent to rescue innocent prisoners for debt : it seemed at first indifferent to the fate of the political prisoners who were regarded as 72 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, criminal conspirators .

		Danton probably shared this first impulse , realizing only later , to use the words of
Belloc	ORGANIZATION	, - that a thing had hap - pened which was to hurt the future of the Rev - olution more than all the armies . ''

		This reaction must have been for him , as for the rest , '' like the breaking of day after that moral night . ''

		When a brief history of the
First Committee of Public Safety	ORGANIZATION	was published some time ago ,
M. Aulard	PERSON	remarked how hazardous it was to attempt such a task without spending years in the archives .

		This reveals also the difficulty of doing more than scratch the surface of
Danton	PERSON	's work in the
First Committee	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here these two books show their least satisfactory pages .

		In spite of the defects and inadequacies already noted , the large and generous outlines of
Danton	PERSON	's figure as a man and as a political leader are fairly clear in these volumes , and the reader confined to English descriptions of the great Cordelier will find in them the first opportunity to gain a modern view of him based on the results of the critical scholarship of
France	LOCATION	.

		The writers will have done a service to the popular understanding of Revolutionary history if they have succeeded in dissolving that figment of uninstructed imagination , the Tri - umvirate ,
Danton	PERSON	,
Robespierre	LOCATION	,
Marat	PERSON	.

		not afford to miss .

		The leaden effect becomes less noticeable upon closer acquaintance , and attracts less attention than the remarkable finish of the style .

		The defects of Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	's qualities are clearly exhibited , and there runs through the book a faint streak of what must be called nastiness which will be no discovery to readers of the author 's pre - vious books .

		But , on the other hand , the peculiar satirical gift of the writer is exhibited almost as brilliantly as in the pages of '' The New Republic , '' and constitutes the real strength of ''
Tristram Lacy	PERSON	, '' although the interest of the story is itself considerable .

		In this case , the social reformer is the target at which Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	aims his shafts , and their penetrative force is not to be denied .

		Various types of reformers are satirized , and particularly the advanced woman who delights in vague abstractions about the new gospel of altruism and the uplifting of the masses through the blessed instrumentality of culture .

		The character of Mrs.
Norham	PERSON	is one of the most effective pieces of satirical delineation with which we are acquainted .

		But if the doings of these people were all , the book would prove monotonous reading ; fortunately , Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	has enough of artistic tact to diversify his scenes , and bring together a great variety of other social types , includ - ing a Prime Minister of
England	LOCATION	, into interesting relations with each other .

		Still , the book is essen - tially one of discussion rather than of action , and , aside from its effective scene-setting , appeals almost wholly to the intellectual sense .

		It is a book which , with its obvious defects , will be found enjoyable by cultivated readers in proportion to their degree of cultivation and the closeness of the attention they give to the perusal .

		It is certainly one of the nota - ble novels of the year .

		Mr.
Legge	PERSON	's '' Mutineers '' is , like the book just mentioned , preoccupied with the social problem , but the treatment is conventional and dull .

		74 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, possibly enter .

		There is a great deal of assorted agony in the book , and a rather lame working-out of the plot The story is one of English society in our own time .

		`` The Fowler '' offers a pathetic illustration of what follows when a slender talent is stretched be - yond its limits .

		When Miss Harraden 's '' Ships That Pass in the Night '' caught the capricious favor of the public , and , pretty as the story was , received ten times the praise that was rationally its due , the writer could do no less than attempt to justify all this laudation by planning a new book upon a more liberal scale .

		The result of this misdirected ambi - tion is a novel in which the characters have no vitality and slight individuality , all speaking the same language , and all the merest puppets in the hands of the show-woman .

		We hesitate to describe in these terms what is no doubt a conscientious piece of workmanship , but
Miss Harraden	LOCATION	's failure is so obvious that it seems best to mince no words about it .

		The heroine is a young woman whose weakness in allowing herself to become ensnared flatly con - tradicts everything that we are told about her char - acter ; the villain-hero , who is crafty enough to en - snare the heroine , is yet such a fool as to write a detailed description of his methods in a private journal and send it to the young woman by mistake .

		In her conception of this character , we can not help thinking that
Miss Harraden	LOCATION	has been unconsciously influenced by '' The Tormentor '' of Mr.
Benjamin Swift	PERSON	, for the two figures are fundamentally akin , although the latter has some reality about him , while the former has almost none .

		It is difficult to speak kindly of such a book as The Maternity of
Harriott Wicken	PERSON	, '' in spite of the writer 's obvious talent for vivid portraiture and striking dramatic effect .

		The objection to this novel is not that it deals with people who have their being in an uninteresting section of middle-class society , or even that its method of treatment is that of re - morseless realism .

		The objection is rather that the author takes a wanton delight in the introduction of sordid and offensive bits of detail , not necessary for the development of her conception , and , it would seem , deliberately calculated to make her work re - pulsive .

		The life which she depicts is a sort of dismal swamp of dank sliminess and miasmatic exha - lations .

		There is no more art about it than there is about the crudest of
M. Zola	PERSON	's productions ; there is only a certain crude and brutal power which fas - cinates but does not impress .

		Dealing with a prob - lem which above all others calls for delicate treat - ment , the writer knows nothing of reticence , and defeats her own ethical purpose .

		Her pages are thronged with horrors which the sunlight of life never softens .

		If the world were such a charnel - house as this depressing book would have us think , the process of putrefaction would long since have exterminated our race .

		American fiction is setting a higher mark every year for the historical novel , and the charge that our writers are neglecting their opportunities in this field is losing its force .

		Such recent books as Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	's
Hugh Wynne	PERSON	'' and
Miss Johnston	PERSON	's '' Prisoners of Hope '' gave us a new sense of the possibilities of our colonial past as material for ro - mance , and now Mr.
Winston Churchill	PERSON	's
Richard Carvel	PERSON	'' has achieved a still higher triumph , and at once takes its place in the very front rank of our historical fiction .

		That the author of that amusing sketch , The Celebrity , '' had it in him to produce this full-bodied romance was , we must admit , a great surprise to us , for the gift of the light social satirist is one thing , and the gift of the successful delineator of a bygone period in all its political , social , and human aspects with the presentation of its acci - dents as well as of its essentials is quite another thing .

		Yet this latter thing Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	has accom - plished , and in a way that betokens the infinite capacity for taking pains '' which , although much of our slapdash criticism of modern slapdash work is apt to forget the fact , is still as characteristic of genius as it ever was .

		We should hesitate to designate as outright genius the power that shaped the present work , but it is , at all events , a power of character - ization and of description , a power of sympathetic insight and vivid dramatic presentation , such as only the best writers of fiction have at their command .

		When we say that this novel of
Maryland	LOCATION	in the days just before the Revolution is constantly remind - ing us of '' The Virginians , '' it is for deeper reasons than tHe mere similarity of theme and situation .

		It is the equipment of the mind that has produced the book , it is the fulness of the life that is depicted .

		These things , even more than the convincing character-studies of
John Paul Jones	PERSON	and
Charles James Fox	PERSON	, and the forcible manner in which
Richard Carvel	PERSON	is made the spokesman of patriotic American sentiment in a great historical moment , these are what distinguish the present novel , and set it upon a plane that hardly any other of our novelists has succeeded in occupying .

		There is probably no other period of English history that has occasioned so many romances as the period of the Civil War , and a writer must have considerable confidence in his powers to enter the lists with still another .

		In ''
Cromwell	PERSON	's Own , '' Mr.
Arthur Paterson	PERSON	deals with the period that begins with the
Long Parliament	ORGANIZATION	and ends with
Marston	PERSON	' Moor .

		He has been greatly daring in his treatment of
Cromwell	LOCATION	, for the great general appears , not as an imposing figure whose shadow is from time to time cast over the scene , but rather as the central character of the romance , and overshadows the pri - vate figures with which the story is nominally con - cerned .

		This attempt at historical portraiture is measurably successful ; it gives us at once the grim - ness and the tenderness of
Cromwell	LOCATION	, it shows us the man who could be great enough to be inconsistent at critical moments , and allow the logic of the heart to oppose the dictates of the more formal logic of the intellect .

		Cromwell 's household and family life , too , are portrayed with sympathetic insight .

		All this , however , does not prevent the story from being
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 75 a charming one considered merely as the romance of a young soldier and a Puritan maiden , and it is a satisfaction to know that the generous heroism of the one and the tender steadfastness of the other do not go in the end unrewarded , although many perils have to be surmounted before that consummation is reached .

		Mr.
Paterson	PERSON	has told a thoroughly good story , which it is a pleasure to praise . ''

		The Pedagogues '' is a mere sketch , but it dis - plays unmistakable talent , besides having the ad - vantage of dealing with a subject almost unexplored by the novelist .

		The
summer	DATE	school is a compara - tively recent development of collegiate work , and , however it may try to make itself like the rest of the year , there remain certain features peculiar to the conditions of the
summer	DATE	season .

		This is the fact upon which Mr.
Arthur Stanwood	PERSON	Pier has seized , and with which he has successfully dealt .

		His characters are a young instructor of the languid and supercilious type , and a group of the students who take his
summer	DATE	course in composition and lit - erature .

		Among these students are two teachers from a country town in the West an ambitious girl who knows nothing of the finer graces of thought or of life , and an equally graceless young man who is besides a misunderstood genius .

		The girl has great self-confidence , but understands that there is much she may learn , and has considerable powers of adap - tation .

		The man is simply a bumptious clodhopper even if he does contribute turgid verses to his county newspaper .

		The two are engaged to be married , although we may hardly call them lovers .

		This is the situation set forth by Mr.
Pier	PERSON	, with a fine sense of the humorous contrast between instructor and instructed .

		And the outcome is helpful on both sides .

		The roughness of the students becomes soft - ened , and the stiff superiority of the teacher melts into a more human sort of feeling through his con - tact with these students of a sort so different from any he has hitherto known .

		For there is a pathetic side to even the most ungainly of the seekers after culture who throng to the
summer	DATE	schools of the great universities ; and this is the thing that chiefly claims the attention upon continued acquaintance . ''

		That Fortune , '' by Mr.
Charles Dudley Warner	PERSON	, is in some sense a continuation of '' A Little Jour - ney in the World '' and '' The
Golden House	ORGANIZATION	, '' the three novels taken together forming a sort of trilogy of American society as it is focalized in
New York	LOCATION	.


Carmen Henderson	PERSON	of '' The
Golden House	ORGANIZATION	, '' and
Mavick	PERSON	, whom she married after the death of her first husband , reappear in the present novel , and the ill-gotten wealth acquired by
Henderson	ORGANIZATION	, and to which the interest of all three books attaches , is in the end lost , to the chastening of all concerned .

		Fresh interest is supplied in the characters of two young people , who seem to embody the hope of our society in their reversion to simpler and saner ideals of life than those illustrated by the generation be - fore them a hope which Mr.
Warner	PERSON	has sufficient optimism to entertain , in spite of what seems to us the steady and alarming disintegration of our social mor - ality .

		The new volume in this series is not quite on the level of its two predecessors , and all three suffer , from the artistic standpoint , in being the product of the critical rather than of the creative intellect .

		In other words , the gift of the essayist rather than that of the novelist is what they exhibit most conspicu - ously .

		But of their charm arid of their wholesome - ness there can not be the least doubt , and we are inclined to consider them the most important con - tribution which their writer has made to American literature . ''

		The Awakening , '' by Mrs.
Chopin	PERSON	, is a story in which , with no other accessories than the trivial details of everyday life in and about
New Orleans	LOCATION	, there is worked out a poignant spiritual tragedy .

		The story is familiar enough .

		A woman is married without knowing what it is to love .

		Her husband is kind but commonplace .

		He cares overmuch for the conventions of life ; she , finding them a bar to the free development of her wayward personality , casts them off when '' the awakening '' comes to her , and discovers , too late , that she has cast off the anchor which alone could have saved her from ship - wreck .

		It is needless to say that the agency by which she becomes awakened is provided by another man .

		But he proves strong enough to resist temp - tation , while she is too weak to think of atoning for her fault .

		To her distraught thinking , self-destruction is the only way out , and the tragedy is accomplished in picturesque fashion .

		The story is a simple one , not without charm , but not altogether wholesome in its tendency .

		Miss
Florence Wilkinson	PERSON	is a new writer , and her first book has many amateurish characteristics .

		It is called '' The Lady of the Flag-Flowers , '' and is the story of a Canadian girl of mixed French and Indian blood .

		Her soul is awakened to the pos - sibilities of life in the great world by companion - ship with a young American student who comes to pass a
summer	DATE	among the habitants of the
Lower Province	ORGANIZATION	.

		Later , she finds her way into this world that she has longed to know , and realizes some of the joys of life and more of its bitterness .

		But her wild spirit is not to be tamed , and so in the end it is broken , for that is the only alternative possible .

		The story is pathetically told , with much evidence of close observation of things French-Canadian , and with a sympathetic affection for the heroine that frail flower uprooted from the native soil in which alone it could hope to flourish .

		The chief fault of the book is that it has too many loose ends .

		Fresh starts are taken so frequently that the interest of the reader becomes unhinged , and he longs for a more straightforward manner of narration .

		Among recent volumes of short stories , that bearing the name of Mr.
S. Levett Yeats	PERSON	is sure to arrest the attention of readers who remember '' The
Chevalier	PERSON	d'Auriac . ''

		It is called '' The Heart of
Denise	PERSON	, '' from the first of the nine pieces which it contains .

		This titular story is practically a novel - ette in dimensions , and has for its theme the period of latter sixteenth century history , and the struggle 76 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, between the Queen-Mother and the Be * arnais .

		It is a good story , with a valiant hero and a pert heroine , coming to a happy conclusion .

		Of the other stories , it remains to say that they are slight in comparison , and that several of them seem to poach upon Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's preserves , a fact to he explained by the statement that Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	has seen much service in
India	LOCATION	, and thus writes from fulness of knowledge .

		The nine stories which Mr.
R. V. Risley	PERSON	has called '' Men 's Tragedies '' with such specific titles as `` The Man Who Loved , '' `` The Man Who Fell , '' and '' The Man Who Cared '' are all studies of an intense sort of character , and , in a sense , are all concerned with '' men who cared '' most earnestly for their ideals .

		These are mostly men of middle age , whose outward lives have been touched by failure , but who have held fast to some of the inner realities , and achieved a sort of spiritual triumph over adverse circumstances .

		There is distinct power in this book , although not here applied upon a scale sufficiently large to show what the writer has it in him to accomplish .

		We shall look forward with peculiar interest to the literary future which it seems safe to say is in store for him . ''

		At a
Winter	DATE	's Fire '' is not a thick volume , but it contains eleven stories , the work of Mr.
Bernard Capes	PERSON	.

		The author seeks to be weird after the fan - tastic fashion of Foe , but his horrors are of a rather cheap sort , and he does not succeed in giving his imagined impossibilities the garb of verisimilitude .

		His method of narration , moreover , is frequently so tortuous as to make the stories difficult reading .

		Mr.
Marriott Watson	PERSON	's six stories are described by the author as ' mostly winter tales , '' which would seem to imply that they , too , were best read '' at a winter 's fire . ''

		But , with one exception , they are not like the ghostly productions of Mr.
Capes	PERSON	, being rather romantic fancies with a core of tragedy .

		The titular story alone , '' The Heart of Miranda , '' has no tragical suggestion about it , but is simply a delicate and elusive study of the several approaches to a maiden 's love , and not strictly a story at all .

		There is really nothing new to say about the new volume of short stories by Mr.
Bret Harte	PERSON	.

		They are partly European and partly
Calif	LOCATION	ornian in theme , and they are better stories than almost anybody else can write nowadays .

		But it must be confessed that Mr.
Harte	PERSON	's characters and situations are growing a little hackneyed , and these '' Stories in Light and Shadow '' are rather less interesting than most of their predecessors .

		The volume of '' Short Rations '' issued to the public by Mr.
Williston	PERSON	Fish contains a series of sketches of life in the American army , all the way from West Point to the frontier post .

		Each sketch is a story , or the next thing to a story , and nearly all are concerned with the fortunes of one McVay , whose career is traced from his entrance into the Academy to the successful termination , many years later , of the romantic courtship which was there begun .

		Mr.
Fish	PERSON	writes from knowledge , which is a strong claim to our attention , and with a crispnesa of literary manner , relieved by dry and effective humor , which is a still more cogent claim .

		He has given us a highly readable little volume , which we can recommend with a clear conscience .

		From Mr. Cable we hear too rarely of late , but when he does put forth a book , we are at least as - sured that his powers suffer no decline for lack of the old-time exercise .

		His '' Strong Hearts , '' just now published , is a collection of three short stories illustrating once more the types of Southern char - acter that he knows so sympathetically and well .

		Stories of '' heroic natures and poetic fates '' he calls them , and insists that the three tales are but one in essence , meaning that the humblest and narrowest life may be turned into song by high purpose and strenuous endeavor , and that this is the all-important thing about his several heroes and heroines .

		In this book , the author seems to take us into a finer spiritual atmosphere than is his wont , and the eth - ical subtleties of the situations devised for us will hardly be penetrated by him who runs as he reads .

		The six stories called '' Love 's Dilemmas , '' by Mr.
Robert Herrick	PERSON	, are in a sense prentice work , having been written from
two to four years ago	DATE	.

		They exhibit the promise of which The Gospel of Freedom '' has been the subsequent fulfilment , and are marked by much fastidiousness of manner and subtlety of delineation .

		But Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	has ad - vanced far beyond the stage represented by these slight performances , and it seems almost a pity to call attention to his early work .

		Mrs.
Burton Harrison	PERSON	's volume of seven stories is characterized by lively invention , animated action , and an infusion of tender sentiment .

		The stories are mostly told of people who move in the most conventional and least humanly interesting section of American society , and it does no small credit to Mrs.
Harrison	PERSON	's gift for entertainment to say that she keeps her readers interested .

		One reason is that she does not take her people too seriously , and knows how to treat `` social aspirations '' with deli - cate satire . ''

		An Author 's Reading '' is a good illustration of this aspect of her work , and is as different as possible from the straightforward nar - rative of The Carcellini Emerald , '' which gives a title to the collection .

		The note of distinction -LRB- as the French would understand it -RRB- is rarely met with in the English or American short story , but it may certainly be found upon almost every page of the book by Mrs.
Edith Wharton	PERSON	, with which this hurried review must close .

		Under the collective title `` The Greater Inclina - tion , '' which belongs to no one of the stories in par - ticular , Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	has brought together eight pieces of delicate texture and artistic conception .

		Every one of them has the external shape and col - oring of the world in which we mingle day by day , and every one of them is at heart a poignant spirit - ual tragedy .

		The veils that are spread over most lives by wont and custom conceal the inner work - ings from the eyes of all but a few ; it is the privi -
1	DATE	lege of the artist to penetrate their enveloping folds
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 77 and scan the bare soul within .

		The present writer does not neglect the outward aspect of the lives which she depicts , but , as the conception becomes developed by touches so deft that we never think of the conscious artistic endeavor , the subjective reality is in each case brought by insensible degrees into the field of vision , until the gaze is at last focussed upon that alone , and the full triumph of the work - manship bursts upon us .

		This may sound like ex - travagant praise , but no conventional commendation would be adequate for such a book .

		Between these stories and those of the ordinary entertaining sort there is a great gulf fixed there is all the differ - ence between the pure gold of art and its pinchbeck imitations .

		WILLIAM
MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		The best sea-writer since
Dana	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS .

		In his Introduction to Mr.
Frank T. Bullen	PERSON	's '' Idylls of the Sea '' -LRB-
Apple	ORGANIZATION	- ton -RRB- Mr.
J. St.	PERSON
Loe Strachey	LOCATION	rightly observes that '' Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	's work in literature re - quires no introduction . ''

		Mr.
Strachey	PERSON	then pro- ceeds at some length to perform the ceremony he thinks superfluous .

		Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	, it will be remem - bered , stood sponsor for Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	's first book ; and as it was a first book , perhaps some little ad - vance trumpeting of this sort was admissible .

		But once was enough . ''

		The Cruise of the Cachalot '' established the reputation of Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	's literary wares , and it was quite unnecessary to call in Mr.
St. Loe Strachey	LOCATION	or anybody else to vouch for their quality .

		We dislike these transparent devices ex - tremely , and Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	's books are precisely of the sort to make their way perfectly well without them .

		Besides , Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	's good wine is well known now , and needs no bush .

		He is the best sea - writer since
Dana	PERSON	, and we earnestly hope that he will take to heart the lesson that
Dana	PERSON	's book is a masterpiece mainly because it is simple , straight - forward , and true .

		Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	is somewhat given to fine language and lurid melodramatic effects ; and wherever these tendencies discover themselves he becomes comparatively tame and rings a little false .

		What one wants from a writer of Mr.
Bul	PERSON	- len 's stamp is plain truth , and not flowers of speech .

		The '' Cruise of the Cachalot '' just missed being a masterpiece because Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	would occasionally '' spread himself '' in a rhetorical way , and turn on the lime-lights .

		The forced episode of the death of Captain Slocum and '' Goliah , '' for instance , is dis - tinctly bad and incredible nearly as bad and incredible as Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	's Yankee dialect , which is easily hors concours in this way .

		Of Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	's Yankee dialect there are , we regret to say , certain weird specimens in the little volume now before us . ''

		Idylls of the Sea '' is a budget of thirty brief sea - sketches , all replete with the lore of ocean , for , be it said , the author joins to the actual experiences of the '' foremast-hand '' a fair measure of scientific acquirement .

		But what makes Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	a rather unique literary figure is the blending in him of the born writer and the common sailor .

		Pen or mar - linespike , it 's clearly all one to Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	.

		In the '' Idylls '' he has given us a gallery of sea-pictures hard to beat in English literature .

		In fine , Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	is facile princeps among sea-writers to-day ; and we trust he will eschew in the future '' fine writing , '' red-fire effects , Yankee dialect , and catch - penny puffery .

		It takes courage to write a book about
Milton	PERSON	in view of the critical and biographical literature already existing , from
Masson	PERSON	's ponderous '' Life '' to the admirable small books by
Mark Pattison	PERSON	and Dr.
Garnett	PERSON	.

		But the little book by Professor
W. P. Trent	PERSON	, entitled ''
John Milton	PERSON	: A Short Study of His Life and Works '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- finds its produc - tion amply justified by the generous enthusiasm and the fine critical sense which it displays .

		It is a panegyric , but a reasoned one ; and its obvious sin - cerity compels us to accept a judgment which can , when most severe , say nothing harsher than that some of
Milton	PERSON	's controversial writing is '' less edi - fying '' than the rest of his work , and which de - clares of Milton at the outset that '' he is the greatest artist , man of letters , and ideal patriot , that the world has ever known . ''

		The book is particularly justified by its solid treatment of the Latin poems , its comparative criticism of the elegiac verse , and its well-weighed comparisons of
Milton	LOCATION	with
Dante	ORGANIZATION	and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		Professor
Trent	PERSON	is of those to whom the '' Paradise Lost '' means even more than does '' The Divine Comedy , '' and who find it difficult to admit outright that even
Shakespeare	PERSON	was the greater poet .

		We can not go with him quite as far as this , but we are at one with him in pro- nouncing Milton '' the great idealist of our
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	race , '' and in accepting the doctrine of the following fine passage : '' It is this pure idealism of his that makes him by far the most important fig - ure , from a moral point of view , among all
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	- Saxons ; for the genius of the race is practical , not ideal , compromise is everywhere regarded with favor as a working principle , and the main lesson we all have to learn is how to stand out unflinchingly for the true , the beautiful , and the good , regardless of merely present and practical considerations ... A due admiration for
Milton	ORGANIZATION	's unflinching idealism , both of thought and action , will at least make it impossible for us to tolerate the charlatanism of compromise . ''

		The prefix '' neo - '' has still something of a v g ue : neo-Christians and neo - Celts have not yet lost all their original brightness .

		We esteem it , then , rather a compliment to call Mr.
Hector C. Macpherson	PERSON	a neo-Smithian : he would return to the purity of the ideas of
Adam Smith	PERSON	, unadulterated by the perver - sities of
Malthus	PERSON	and Ricardo .

		The volume on
Smith	ORGANIZATION	in the '' Famous Scots '' series -LRB- imported by
Scrib	PERSON	-
78	DATE	THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, ner -RRB- is rather more on
Smith	ORGANIZATION	's thoughts than on his actions ; but this is as it should be .

		An emi - nent critic once remarked that people were silly always to ask , What are you doing ?

		when the really important question is , What are you thinking ?

		It does not appear that
Adam Smith	PERSON	's life was more interesting than that of many another man of his day : save for his ideas , be was really what Mr.
Macpherson	PERSON	says he seemed , '' simply a sedate , absent-minded Scotsman , who lived a humdrum life in the region of dry and forbidding speculation . ''

		But '' The Wealth of Nations '' is a matter of inter - est , of how much interest , few lay readers will sus - pect until they read Mr.
Macpherson	PERSON	's book .

		It is an admirable study , a thoroughly modern criticism .

		The author speaks of it as '' the outcome of a desire to show the vitality of the principles of
Smith	ORGANIZATION	's great work , and to trace their relations to the fruitful gen - eralizations associated with the Evolution theory . ''

		We should ourselves think the book quite as much the outcome of a desire to show the unsound founda - tion of certain political and commercial conditions of to-day , a pamphlet against ultra-imperialism and jingoism abroad and trades-unionism and socialism at home , a pamphlet meant for
England	LOCATION	, to be sure ; but we who have also some experience of the conditions against which the aid of
Adam Smith	ORGANIZATION	is invoked will find our own ideas stimulated .

		Inci - dentally , we may note the author would rescue Political Economy from the verbal vice of
Carlyle	LOCATION	, by demonstrating that it is not '' the dismal science . ''

Spain	LOCATION	as Shown by her Novelists '' -LRB-
Truslove	ORGANIZATION	,
Hanson , & Comba	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Thanks to the numerous existing trans - lations , most readers know that , whatever her polit - ical shortcomings ,
Spain	LOCATION	has produced a group of contemporary writers of fiction of which any coun - try might be proud .

		Those who have read the books of these novelists are aware , moreover , that they have documentary value of a very high sort , and that from all the hysterical journalism of the past year there could not be constructed so truthful a panorama of the Spanish society of to-day as may be viewed in the pages of the Spanish novelist * .

		It was , then , distinctly a happy thought on the part of Miss
Mary W. Plnmmer	PERSON	to prepare the little book of selections now under consideration .

		Miss Plnm - mer has examined seventeen books by five writers
Sefiora Bazan	PERSON	and
Seftores Alarcdn	PERSON	,
Galdtfa	LOCATION	,
Vald	PERSON	^ s , and Valera and has extracted from them such passages as seem most illuminative of the present - day aspects of Spanish life .

		These passages are classified under the heads of local description , reli - gion , politics , manners and customs , and society , and make up a highly interesting and instructive volume .

		The books drawn upon have all been pub - lished during the past quarter-century , so that the picture they present is strictly modern .

		The Rev.
Edward Everett Hale	PERSON	contributes a brief introduc - tion to this book , which we commend most heartily , both because of its interest as a study of contem - porary society , and because it may pave the way to a wider acquaintance with the remarkable literature upon which it is based .

		A helpful ttudy of the Renaittnncf .

		If Miss
Lilian F. Field	PERSON	, in her '' Intro - duction to the Study of the Renais - sance '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , had done nothing more than make it clear when and where the series of movements gathered into the meaning of that single word took place , she would deserve well of the student .

		But she does a great deal more .

		It is plain from the most cursory glance at her pages that not only was the Renaissance a series of phe - nomena of varied origin and scene , but that there were as many renaissances as there were arts , some - times several within the limits of a single nation ; while it is likely that the English-speaking peoples have not had their awakening in painting and sculp - ture to this day .

		This will serve to strike down a popular fancy , obtained from `` study clubs '' and the like , that the movement was a definite one , involving all the beaux arts and capable of precise and cogent treatment within narrow compass .

		Once it is made clear , as
Miss Field	ORGANIZATION	makes it clear , that the word describes the entire transition from the middle ages to the modern fulness of spirit , and is a continuing and most highly diversified movement extending over the whole field of civilization , it will become capable of a popular treatment that is also scientific .

		The author is careful to accent the fact that her volume , compendious and well written as it is , must be taken as nothing more than a guide past the threshold of a very large topic ; and her readers are to be congratulated accordingly .

Joubert	PERSON	's personal life because , as Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	says , - the reader who takes with him the memory of these personal inci - dents and affections will find , as he turns to the PensieS -RRB- that it interests them with a new charm , that it neutralizes that slight air of pedantry which perhaps such a book must always wear in the eyes of after-generations , and makes him docile and friendly toward the writer even when he is most fine - spun or most dogmatic . ''

		The determining points in the man 's personal history were his marriage , and his two great friendships , the one with

Madame de Timtimille	ORGANIZATION	; and these Mrs.

		The book is valuable , and will be distinctly welcome ; for there are many people perhaps a greater number than we think , even when we think most sensibly who , while unable to read the Pensees in the language in which they were written , are yet keenly alive to all such fastidiousness of expression and all such delicate wisdom as they contain .

		More interesting than most histories and far more true than most ro - mances , the translation made by Lady
Mary Loyd	PERSON	of
K. Waliszewski	PERSON	's ''
Mary	PERSON	- sienka '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- affords excellent reading , whether for diversion or instruction .

		Marie de la

Marie de Gonzague	PERSON	who became the wife of Ladislaw IV .

Poland	LOCATION	.

		A mere child at the time of her expatria - tion , and a dependent child as well through her parents ' poverty , she nevertheless rose to be the queen of
Poland	LOCATION	, having been married to the great
Sobieski	LOCATION	.

		Her elevation in that elective monarchy was due primarily to her husband 's great military talents , but these as has happened so often in his - tory might very well have gone without the honor of the Polish crown had Marysienka been less of a courtier and politician .

		The author has been wise in weaving the facts into a rapid , easy narrative , the charm of which has been caught and retained by the translator .

		_ A modem Bases of the Mystic Knowl - interpretation edge '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , M. Re ` ce ` jac has of Mysticism .

		giyen & nota -RCB- , i e mo dern interpreta - tion and vindication of mysticism .

		The author is well acquainted both with the latest tendencies in science and philosophy and with mediaeval and an - cient mysticism ; he can quote
Ribot	PERSON	and
Tylor	PERSON	with the same intelligence as
St. Augustine	ORGANIZATION	and St.
Francis	PERSON	.

		What is the psychic essence and the real significance of mysticism , with its intuition of God , its symbolism and its ecstacy ?

		The author 's answer is that mysticism as a true factor in humanity is purely subjective , a moral aspiration which lifts man to the heights of real freedom and love , and giving him peace in the sense of his being thus in the Ab - solute and the Absolute in him . ''

		The mystical faculty is in reality the moral consciousness confided to its own sole initiative . ''

		But symbolism is only a language of the imagination , and denotes no more than the vision of the artist as to external realities .

		We commend this essay on the higher Pantheism as being eminently sane , suggestive , and penetrating .

		A popular handbook for young col - lectors and students of insects has been a desideratum for many years .

		Miss
Belle S. Cragin	PERSON	's '' Oar Insect Friends and Foes '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- bids fair to meet this need .

		It is a compact and yet very comprehensive guide for the amateur student of insects and their allies , con - taining as it does simple directions for collecting , An amateur 's handbook of insects .

		Gambling as a folly and an art .

		mounting , and preserving insects of various kinds , and plans for cases and cabinets .

		Instructions are also given for field-work and the haunts and habits of insects are discussed .

		The book contains a brief account of the anatomy of insects , both in the adult and larval stages , and a discussion of their trans - formations .

		The greater part of the work is taken up with an extended treatment of the various orders , representatives being chosen from the more com - mon insects of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Over 250 figures illustrate the text and obviate the necessity of the introduction of technical descriptions , thus permit - ting more attention to the life histories and habits .

		In this feature especially the work deserves high commendation .

		The system of classification used is up to date , and the information which the book con - tains is trustworthy and is told in simple language .

		The work is well done and admirably suited to its purpose , and the book will be a boon to school and public libraries as well as to students of the insect world .

		The author of the book called '' The Gambling World '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- , a well - known writer on sporting topics under the pen-name of '' Rouge et Noir , '' has put forth a work which may be taken as encyclopaedic in its scope , classing the various sorts of specula - tion , in stock-markets and the like , along with the other games of chance , differentiating them only by showing that the risks which are well defined and ascertainable in ordinary gambling defy computa - tion '' on ` Change . ''

		There is an explanation of that mysterious something-nothing commonly called '' luck '' which is exceedingly ingenious .

		Showing that the whole limit of chance as mathematically demonstrated is equal to a circle of wide circum - ference , he figures the impossibility of covering more than a minute arc of this within the limits of a sin - gle lifetime .

		Did one live long enough , he argues , matters would have equalized themselves and the mathematical law been justified ; as it is , the unfor - tunate segment of the circle may fall to one man 's share , while his neighbor has the compensating por - tion .

		The entire book is filled with interesting expe - rience , and is quite free from that pseudo - classical knowledge which disfigures so many works of a similar nature .

		A belated When the tenth volume of the ad - Epoch of mirable series of ''
Epochs of Church Church	ORGANIZATION	history .

		History '' was noticed in these col - umns , some months since , the fact was overlooked that the second volume had not yet made its appear - ance .

		That volume is now before us .

		It is on u The Post-Apostolic Age , '' is by the Rev.
Lucius Water	PERSON	- man ,
D.D.	LOCATION	, and has an introduction by
Bishop Potter	PERSON	of
New York	LOCATION	.

		It is the largest of the vol - umes by twenty or thirty pages , and is published , not by the Christian Literature Company , as were all the others , but by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		We have no hesitancy in regarding this be - lated volume as the best of the series .

		The Post -
80	DATE	HIE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, Apostolic Age is not a promising subject for a book of popular interest ; but Dr.
Waterman	PERSON	has succeeded in presenting the fruits of his wide re - searches among works embodying the most recent scholarship , in such form as to command a fair degree of attention and interest at the
end of this nineteenth century	DATE	.

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		One of the clearest and best-arranged text books of rhetoric that have come to our notice is the ''
Composi	PERSON	- tion and Rhetoric for Schools '' just published by Messrs.
Scott	PERSON	,
Foresman & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is the joint work of Messrs.
Robert Herrick	PERSON	and
Lindsay Todd Damon	PERSON	, of the Uni - versity of
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		It provides preliminary chapters upon constructive work , and then proceeds to discuss usage , diction , and the rhetorical laws of sentences and paragraphs .

		Finally , the whole composition is dealt with , and the various forms of composition described .

		Rhetoric and composition go hand in hand throughout the work , and the exercises are chosen and grouped with a skill evidently born of experience in dealing with the difficulties of young students .

		A compact and attractive little book that should appeal to all intending visitors to the approaching
Paris	LOCATION	Exposition is '' Lee 's Guide to Gay Paree ' and Every - day French Conversation '' -LRB-
Laird & Lee	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The author , Prof.
Max Maury	PERSON	.

		has departed from the usual prosaic manner of the stereotyped guide-book , and writes in a vivacious and entertaining way that makes his little volume something more than a dry catalogue of facts .

		Much odd and out of the way information is given , and the text is supplemented by a number of useful maps and illustrations .

		The volume is of vest-pocket dimen - sions , and is serviceably and artistically bound in leather .

		The '' Source-Book of American History '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- which Dr.
Albert Bushnell Hart	PERSON	has '' edited for schools and readers '' is a volume that we have ex - amined with close attention and can commend with con - fidence .

		In about four hundred pages of text , it finds room for something like one hundred and fifty examples of the original material of our history , ranging all the way from the voyages of
Columbus	LOCATION	to the Spanish - American war .

		The selections are judiciously made , edited , and annotated ; the introductory chapters for teachers are of the most helpful sort , and the book is sold at so low a price that no secondary school in which American history is taught can find a reasonable ex - cuse for not employing it as an adjunct to the regular manual .

		The '' Lebensgeschichte '' of
Julian n Heinrich Jung	PERSON	, genaunt Stilling , has been edited by Mr.
Sigmon M. Stern	PERSON	for
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is a pecu - liarly timely publication , in view of the approaching Goethe anniversary , and the book is a welcome addition to the texts available for school use .

		A '' Second Year in German , '' by Mr.
I. Keller	PERSON	, is a recent publication of the
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	, who also send us a small book of '' French Sight Reading , '' prepared by Mr.
L. C. Rogers	PERSON	.

		We may mention , too , the neat text of
Mol	ORGANIZATION	- iere 's '' Le Misanthrope , '' edited for
Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co.	ORGANIZATION	by Dr.
Charles A. Eggert	PERSON	.

		I i 1 KKAIIY NOTES .

		Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons are the importers of a handsome volume entitled `` Greek Sculpture with Story and Song , '' by Miss
Albinia Wherry	PERSON	.

		It is a book for young people and for the general reading public not desirous of a too technical and archeological treatment of the subject .

		A handsome library edition , styled the ''
Thornton	PERSON	, '' of the novels of the
Bronte	PERSON	sisters , edited by Mr.
Temple Scott	PERSON	, is now in course of publication by
Messrs. Downey & Co.	ORGANIZATION	of
London	LOCATION	. ''


Agnes Grey	PERSON	'' is the first volume to appear .

		The Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	are the American importers of this edition .

		`` Drawing for Printers , '' by Mr.
Ernest Knaufft	PERSON	, is '' a practical treatise on the art of designing and illus - trating in connection with typography . ''

		It is designed for both beginners and advanced students , is amply illustrated , and is a manual of the most practically help - ful sort .

		It is published by the
Inland Printer Co.	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Plant Relations : A
First Book of Botany	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Pro- fessor
John M. Coulter	PERSON	, is published by the Messrs.
Appleton	PERSON	in their series of '' Twentieth Century Text - Books . ''

		This volume is devoted to the outlines of ecology , and will be followed by a companion work hav - ing morphology for its predominant subject .

		The text is planned for secondary schools , and is beautifully illustrated .

		M The Study of History in Schools , '' being the report made to the
American Historical Association	ORGANIZATION	upon that subject by the
Committee of Seven	ORGANIZATION	appointed in
1896	DATE	, has just been published in a volume by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The importance of the work is sufficiently guar - anteed by the names attached to it .

		They include Professors
A. C. McLaughliu	PERSON	,
H. B. Adams	PERSON	,
A. B. Hart	PERSON	, and
H. Morse Stephens	PERSON	.

		The seventh volume to be published in the series of '' Literatures of the World , '' as edited by Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	, is '' A History of Bohemian Literature , '' by
Francis	PERSON	, Count Liitzow -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		Since Bohemian writers , excepting
Huss	PERSON	and Comenius , are all but abso - lutely unknown to English readers , the author of this volume has departed from the general plan of the series in giving a large amount of space to translated extracts .

		Psychology reduced to its lowest terms is what we find in An Outline Sketch of Psychology for Begin - ners , '' issued by the
Open Court Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		That the work is sound in principle and modern in treatment may safely be inferred from the fact that it is written by Professor
H. M. Stanley	PERSON	.

		If it be advisable -LRB- which we doubt -RRB- to attempt the instruction of children in psychology , this little manual of forty pages may be recommended .

		SECONDARY ENGLISH TEXTS A Thoroughly Modern and Practical Text-Book in Composition and Rhetoric for Schools By
ROBERT HERRICK	PERSON	.

		A.B. , and
LINDSAY TODD DAMON	PERSON	,
A. B.	PERSON	, both of the
Department of English	ORGANIZATION	,
The University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	.

		This book embodies the most recently accepted method in English teaching in secondary schools .

		It has some distinctive features .

		INVENTIONAL WORK in shaping and ar - ranging thought receives the first attention .

		The student is aided in discovering and developing his powers of expression both by the skilful directions of the book and by the work of theme-writing .

		The criticism of themes is at first suggestive , not re - pressive and discouraging .

		Genuine interest and self-confidence will follow this method of work , and the student will rapidly mature the power of written expression .

		RHETORICAL THEORY as such is not pre - sented until the second part of the book , where it is taken up systematically .

		The study of good use in words , of diction , and of the rhetorical laws of the sentence and the paragraph , is followed by a general review of literary laws as applied to the whole composition .

		THE EXERCISES present many original and valuable features .

		They are suggestive , interest - ing , carefully chosen as to subject matter , and within the range of the average student 's experi - ence and knowledge . ''

		The arrangement and method please me exceed - ingly .

		The freshness of the illustrations , the order of subjects treated in
Part I.	LOCATION	, the plan of the book as a whole , commend it especially . ''

		Professor W. .

		SlMONDS ,
Knox College	ORGANIZATION	,
Galesburg	LOCATION	, III . ''

		The book commends itself to me as wholly admir - able in arrangement , method , and style of treatment .

		I particularly approve of the idea of the authors that the beginning work should stimulate invention in com - position , should be constructive , and that the minute criticism of details should come later .

		I shall put the book on the list of books recommended by the English Department to preparatory schools fitting for
Welles	LOCATION	- ley . ''

		HAMILTON MABIE in the

		To say that it reminds us of ' The Virginians ' is to make an audacious comparison , but one which will nat - rally occur to many readers .

		That '

		... In short , this is a strong and notable novel . ''

Charleston	LOCATION	, S. C. -RRB- - '' The charm of the book , which is very great , lies in the vividness of its pictures of the life of

		Washington Times .

		BRILLIANT PICTURES OF COLONIAL LIFE . ''

		The young writer , with his head full of the great romances , is tempted to emulate them all , to excel by piling up merits .

		Thus , the author of '
Richard Carvel	PERSON	, ' in setting out to write a romance of the
American Revo	ORGANIZATION	- lution , has boldly vied with the author of ' Kidnapped ' in the usurping uncle and the kidnapping of Richard by the slaver , with the author of 1 The Virginians ' in his pictures of the colonial gentry and the visit of the young colonial to the fashionable life of
London	LOCATION	, with the author of '
Henry Esmond	PERSON	' in the description of a reigning
London	LOCATION	beauty , with the romancers of the sea in the fight of
John Paul Jones	PERSON	with the slaver and with the Serapis . ''

CONTINENTAL	ORGANIZATION	LITERATURE .

		n. Continuing from our last issue the summary , based upon reports written for the
London	LOCATION	'' Athenaeum , '' of the literary productivity of the past year in
Continental Europe	LOCATION	, we now present the facts of chief importance for Hun - gary ,
Italy	LOCATION	,
Norway	LOCATION	,
Poland	LOCATION	,
Russia	LOCATION	, and
Spain	LOCATION	.

		The writers who have furnished them are , re - spectively ,
Herr Leopold Katscher	PERSON	,
Signer Guido Biagi	PERSON	,
Herr C. Brinchmann	PERSON	, Professor
Adam Belcikowski	PERSON	, Mr.
Constantine Balmont	PERSON	, and
Don Rafael Altamira	PERSON	. ''

		Hitherto , '' says the writer upon Hungarian literary affairs , '' I have never had to dwell at any length upon books on art , for the simple reason that our writers have been persistently neglectful of this branch of literature .

		Within the last twelvemonth their views seem to have changed , for the output of art books has per - haps been far greater than ever before , and is all the more striking as it includes the two most important publications of the whole season .

		First stands '
Italia	ORGANIZATION	, ' an attractive externally and internally attractive volume of studies in Italian art by Mr.
Albert Berzeviczy	PERSON	. ''

		Sec - ond comes the two folio volumes on `` Hunga - rian Art Treasures , '' edited by Mr.
E. de Radisics	PERSON	.

		Three volumes are yet to come , and Mr.
Jokai	PERSON	introduces the publication .

		History comes next on the list , and the writer notes progress in several important many-volumed undertakings , besides announcing the '' Great Illustrated History of the World , '' a collabo - rative publication in twelve volumes , under the editorship of Mr.
Henrik Marczali	PERSON	.

		Fiction embraces the '' Story of a Girl , '' by Mr.
F. Herczeg	PERSON	; '' The Silver Goal , '' by Mr.
Brody	PERSON	; '' Uneven Wednesdays , '' by Mr.
Szomahazy	PERSON	; and '' Autumn Hunting , '' by Mr.
Arpad Berc	PERSON	- zik .

		The latter , who is also a successful writer of comedies , '' takes his subjects from common - place life ; this offers quite enough matter for banter .

		He is a serene , smiling , quiet observer , who takes
Horace	PERSON	's advice , tidendo dicere verum , and he invariably writes in the most amiable style . ''

		He has also produced this year a comedy , ''
Himfy	PERSON	's Songs , '' in his best style .

		Other dramatic works are two by Mr.
Jokai	PERSON	, and two by Mr.
Herczeg	PERSON	.

		Allied with this subject are Mr.
Joseph Bayer	PERSON	's '' History of Hungarian Dramatic Literature '' and Mr.
Sziiry	PERSON	's '' Dramatic Impressions , '' dealing chiefly with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Albert Popipi	PERSON	's ''
Byron	PERSON	and Shelley '' shows , at least , that the interest of Hungarians in English literature is not confined to our greatest poet .

		The year 's literary harvest in
Italy	LOCATION	, we are told at the outset , has been neither prosperous nor abundant . ''

		Hailstorms and drought have ruined the crops and impeded the productive - ness of the soil , restricting the yield almost entirely to learned works or occasional writ - ings . ''

		The riots of a year ago , and the various centenaries of the past twelvemonth have been 88 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, partly responsible for this result . ''

		We have commemorated
Amerigo Vespucci	PERSON	and
Paolo Toscanelli	PERSON	,
Savonarola	LOCATION	,
Leopardi	LOCATION	,
Moretto	PERSON	of
Brescia	LOCATION	,
Bernini	ORGANIZATION	, and these celebrations have involved a shower of speeches , biographical writings , critical studies and occasional mono - graphs which now take the place of those poems under which , in former times , the printing - presses used to groan , substituting for the
Arcadia	LOCATION	of poetry another boredom , the Ar - cadia of erudition . '' ''

		The
Italo	PERSON	- American centenary dedicated to
Tosca	LOCATION	- nelli and
Vespucci	PERSON	baa produced one good volume , the ' Life of
Amerigo Vespucci	PERSON	, ' written originally by
Signer A. M. fiandini	PERSON	, published under the superintendence of the committee for the
Florence	LOCATION	celebrations .

		The Sa - vonarola centenary , besides the annual flowering of roses in the
Piazza	LOCATION	della Signoria -LRB- on the day of the historic bonfire -RRB- , has produced the excellent selection from the works of Savonarola published by Professor
Villari	PERSON	and
Signer E. Casanova	PERSON	, to which volume the publishers hare added the '
Cronaca	PERSON	' of Filipepi , the brother of
Alessandro Botticelli	PERSON	, a new and important document of the Reformer 's times .

		The Leopardi centenary has yielded a still better harvest .

		Apart from the speeches I should mention some publications of prime importance for the study of the poet of Recanati : in the first place ,
Signer Giosue Carducci	PERSON	's volume , ' Form and Spirit in the Poems of
Giacomo Leopardi	PERSON	, ' and in the next ,
Signor Federioo	PERSON	di
Roberto	PERSON	's psychological study entitled '
Leo	PERSON	- pardi , ' which is in reality the history of a soul the soul of the unhappy poet .

		We have also the long-expected '
Pensieri Inediti di G. Leopardi	PERSON	, ' edited by a government commission from
MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		formerly in the possession of
Antonio Ranieri	PERSON	, claimed by the government on grounds of public utility .

		Three volumes of these '
Pensieri	PERSON	' have already seen the light , and seven more are to fol - low .

		This work , hitherto unknown , reveals the whole development of the poet 's mind ; it forms , as it were , a forest of thoughts and reflections which are the raw material of the work afterwards matured and polished by Leopardi in such artistic perfection .

		Just now in
Italy	LOCATION	, lectures and public readings take the place of books for many people . ''

		A most intimate friend of mine affirms that the lec - ture is the bicycle of literature : it has created a sportive literature , a literature of diversion , easily digested , and often limited in aim .

		Time was when
Italy	LOCATION	was the country of academies ; a century ago they were counted by hundreds .

		Now it threatens to become the classic land of lectures .

		... At
Florence	LOCATION	, for the
last ten years	DATE	, there has been going on a series of lectures on ' La
Vita Italiana	PERSON	' at various periods , beginning with the least known of medieval times .

		The most illus - trious Italian men of letters , and some foreigners , includ - ing
Symonds	PERSON	and
Vernon Lee	PERSON	, ' have contributed to this work , which , carrying out a design prepared beforehand by the promoting committee , constitutes a complete course on the history of Italian culture , and which , pub - lished in volume form , is now in the hands of all of pu - pils in secondary schools as well as of private students . ''

		Dante has by no means been neglected in these lectures , and the following statement is ex - tremely interesting : `` The Florentine committee of the
Italian Dante Society	ORGANIZATION	has renewed , in the historic ball of Or San Mil-hell - now dedicated to
Dante	ORGANIZATION	the reading and explanation of the '
Divina Commedia	ORGANIZATION	, ' which began in the poet 's own city by
Boccaccio	PERSON	in
1373	DATE	, and ceased fifteen years ago , with the death of Father
G. B. Giu	PERSON	- liani .

		Every
Thursday	DATE	from
November	DATE	to
June	DATE	, a canto of the poem is read and explained every time by a fresh commentator .

		The first canto , after the expla - nation , was recited by
Signor Tommaso Salvini	PERSON	.

		The best-known
Dante	ORGANIZATION	scholars , such as
Signori Pio Rajna	PERSON	,
Guido Mazzoni	PERSON	,
Corrado Ricci	PERSON	, have recently inaugu - rated this new Dante professorship .

		In next
November	DATE	and the following months the readings will be given by
Signori Carducci	PERSON	,
Del Luugo	ORGANIZATION	,
Panzacchi	LOCATION	,
Casini	PERSON	, and , in short , the most illustrious men , who count it an honour to render this homage to the poet and the Baptist 's city . ''

		Critical literature is chiefly represented by studies in
Dante	ORGANIZATION	from the hands of
Signor Pio Rajna	ORGANIZATION	and
Signor Nidoro	PERSON	del Lungo , by Pro- fessor
Lisio	PERSON	's edition of the '' Principe , '' and by
Signor Carducci	PERSON	's edition of the '' Rime '' of Petrarch .

		The latter is '' a work gathering up the results of forty years ' study of
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	, completed by the poet with admirable perse - verance a work indeed above the average , both in its method and in its abundant stores of learning , sifted and discussed with critical and artistic taste .

		No one will henceforth care to read
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	except under the guidance of
Carducci	PERSON	. ''

		Classical studies have been numer - ous , and the interest taken in them at the pres - ent time is well illustrated by the following : '' Very curious is a bi-monthly published at
Rome	LOCATION	-LRB- bis in mense prodit -RRB- under the title of <
Vox Urbis	ORGANIZATION	, ' written entirely in
Latin	LOCATION	.

		The editor prefers prose writings -LRB- soluta oratione -RRB- ; those in verse -LRB- numeris fusa -RRB- are condemned to the waste-paper basket , which here appears as cistellula .

		This shows that the love of Latin is not dead among us , and this is confirmed by another circumstance , still more grotesque : the ` Ri vista d'ltalia ' publishes an elegant Latin ode by the octogenarian Senator
G. B. Giorgini	PERSON	under the title ' In Bicyclettam . ' ''

		In miscellaneous literature there is a second volume of
General della Rocca	ORGANIZATION	's autobiography , and a volume by
Signor de Amicis	PERSON	, entitled '' La
Carrozza	PERSON	di Tutti , '' which studies '' the physiology of city life as it can be observed from a tramcar . ''

		The best verse of the year is found in volumes by
Signori Angelo Orvieto	PERSON	and
Alfredo Baccelli	PERSON	.

		Novels and short stories of any value are almost non-existent .

		As for the stage , all other interests are overshadowed by that taken in
Signor d'Annunzio	PERSON	's '' La Giooonda . ''

		In this play the author '' has striven to bring back poetry where a grotesque realism has prevailed too long .

		A noble at - tempt , but the stage is the realm of the probable , and often not to say always poetry departs from truth and appears improbable and absurd . ''

		1899 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 89
Herr Bjornson	PERSON	's powerful drama , ''
Paul Lange	PERSON	and Tora Parsberg '' has been the great event of the twelvemonth in
Norway	LOCATION	. ''

		Admirably adapted for scenic representation though it be , it has as yet not been produced on any stage in
Norway	LOCATION	, though it has been played several times in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		The obvious reason of this is , of course , that , through the inevitable publicity attending all social events in our small community , too abnormal a sensation was called forth by the fact that the principal character of the play is a but thinly veiled impersonation of a well - known politician , who some years ago committed suicide during a political crisis intensified , and all but brought to a point , by the author of this drama . ''

		The writer can not restrain his enthusiasm for this remarkable work , saying further of the hero that '' to this highly finished study of char - acter the author has brought all his knowledge of human nature and eager sympathy , '' and of the heroine that she '' may be considered the finest womanly character in modern literature . ''

		In another way the year is important for dra - matic art since it has just witnessed the open - ing of the new
National Theatre of Christiania	ORGANIZATION	.

		This will be '' the special home of Norwegian plays , '' and has already acquired the right of production for the new piece by Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	, promised for the coming autumn .

		The only other books that we need mention are ''
Byens Fffidre	PERSON	, '' by
Herr E. Kraemmer	PERSON	; `` Fugl Fonix , '' by
Herr G. Scott	PERSON	; '' Hugormen , '' by
Herr H. E. Kinck	PERSON	; Afkom , '' by

Herr J. Bing	PERSON	; and
Herr Kjaer	PERSON	's revised and critical edition of the comedies of
Holberg	ORGANIZATION	.

		Polish literature has little to report of inter - est to the outside world . ''

		Mr.
Sienkiewicz	PERSON	has not yet completed his great historical ro - mance ' The Crusaders , ' nor Madame E. Or - zeszko her ' Argonauts , ' a picture of moral depravity and the most recent times .

		Many , also , of our elder writers have been completely silent , so that new names as , of course , is the natural way of things gain constantly more space in our literature . ''

		Works of fic - tion that have actually appeared include '' At the Edge of the Forest , '' by Mr.
W. Sieros	PERSON	- zewski ; * ' The Promised Land , '' by Mr.
W. Reymont	PERSON	; '' The Swindlers , '' by Mr.
A. Grus	PERSON	- zecki ; '' In the Old Mansion , '' by the same author ; '' The Labors of Sisyphus , '' by Mr.
J. Lych	PERSON	; '' The Distaff , '' by Mr.
M. Rodzie	PERSON	- wicz ; '' The Young Lady , '' by Miss
Emma Jelenska	PERSON	; and `` Brothers and
Elective Affin	ORGANIZATION	- ity , '' by Mrs.
Z. Kowerska	PERSON	. ''

		The only representative of the historical novel in the past twelvemonth has been the new work of Mr.
A. Krechowiecki	PERSON	, ' For the Throne , ' in which he brings be - fore the reader in many effective scenes and with great skill , the bloodless struggle which broke out in
Poland	LOCATION	after the abdication of
John Casimir	PERSON	.

		The best of the many characters introduced is undoubtedly that of the great Elector of
Brandenburg	LOCATION	, who took a leading part in the intrigues . ''

		Of lyric poets , two are mentioned , Mr.
J. Kas	PERSON	- prowicz , with '' The Wild Rose Shrub , '' and Mr.
L. Rydel	PERSON	, with a volume of poems . ''

		There are three monographs to record on Mickiewicz : a brilliant essay by the poetess Mrs.
Konop	PERSON	- nicka ; '
Adam Mickiewicz	PERSON	: a Psychological Study of the Poet , ' by Mr.
A. Belcikowski	PERSON	; and ' The Esthetic of
Mickiewicz	PERSON	, ' by Mr.
P. Chmielowski	PERSON	, a book full of profound and orig - inal views . ''


Russia	LOCATION	is still a country in which literature seeks , to an unusual extent , periodical and other ephemeral outlets . ''

		With us the colourless monthly magazine is in full vigour ; it is accompanied by the empty newspaper .

		The main contents of these publications are feeble stories of life among the people , or , even worse , those that deal with the purposeless life of the so-called ' intelligent class . '

		To these we must add melancholy essays on economic questions and scientific compilations weak critical studies which continually repeat thoughts uttered years ago by abler journalists .

		The ethical element in our romances is at the same time the lever of
Archi	LOCATION	- medes and the heel of Achilles in Russian literature .

		The everlasting confusion of two entirely different spheres of literary production gives the world at one time such splendid productions as ' Crime and Punish - ment , ' by
Dostoievski	PERSON	, and the '
Anna Karenina	PERSON	' of
Tolstoi	LOCATION	, and at another lands Russian literature in the hopeless quagmire in which it is now found . ''

		Count Tolstoy 's '' The Resurrection '' is , of course , the chief work of the year .

		The follow - ing is a part of the criticism made upon it : '' It is impossible to utter a decisive opinion on this novel , because it is not yet finished , but , judging by the chapters which have already been published , we can see the literary methods of the contemporary
Tolstoi	LOCATION	.

		Hav - ing planned a whole series of astonishing artistic com - binations , he himself destroys them , by underscoring for greater emphasis what is obvious ; he furnishes them with a commentary , and converts his novel into a com - monplace sermon on truths which no one disputes .

		He lowers his genius to the attitude of a schoolmaster with a ferule in his hand . ''

		A complete edition of the works of Mr.
K. K. Sluchevski	PERSON	is a noteworthy publication .

		This poet , largely ignored until recently , '' occupies quite a peculiar position : he imitates no one , he speaks his own language , which is full of that expressiveness which we find in a harmo - niously constructed mind which has the pro- fundity of an inviolate sincerity .

		If among 90 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, Russian poets there is one who has never lied , has not gone in quest of phrases , but has been true to himself , '' that poet is the one under consideration .

		In poems of '' a dark and terrible beauty '' he suggests
Baudelaire	PERSON	and
M. Richepin	PERSON	.

		An important work of his - torical scholarship is the just completed four - volume biography of Alexander I. , by Mr.
N. K. Shilder	PERSON	. ''

		This is no ordinary historical work , but rather an historico - psychological monograph .

		The author has concentrated all his attention on the personality of the Tsar .

		He submits it to a minute analysis , full of sci - entific and artistic merit .

		It is a character composed of contradictions : at one time full of heroism , decision , and manliness ; at another , timid and yielding like a reed in the wind .

		Such a person is fitted to become the hero of a poem . ''

		The three - volume history of Russian literature , from the earliest times to
Lemonosov	LOCATION	, by Mr.
A. Pypin	PERSON	, has also been completed . ''

		The end of the best month of this year I mean the
last week of May	DATE	was made memorable for
Russia	LOCATION	by a national festival , the centenary of the birth of
Pushkin	LOCATION	.

		Pushkin is our glory , our pride , our sun .

		His songs , full of native beauty for us , were the dawn of Russian poetry .

		In the
last hours of the century	DATE	that has passed , when the horizon of the intellectual life of
Russia	LOCATION	is enveloped in mist , it is consoling to see that on the edges of the dark clouds the beams of that sun still shine which illumined us in the morning hour .

		These beams promise us a new dawn , new happiness , new youth . ''

		Spanish literature remains chiefly noteworthy for its voluminous production of books in the historical field , including much local history , and the publication of many unprinted docu - ments .

		These books have little interest out - side of the country of their origin , and we pass them without special mention , noting , however , that subjects '' relating to our former colonies in
America	LOCATION	and
Oceania	LOCATION	'' have been in special favor . ''

		Belles-lettres are positively in a state of decay . ''

		Among novels , there are two ''
Epi	ORGANIZATION	- sodios Nacionales , '' by SeHor
Galdos	PERSON	; '' La Alegria del Capitan Ribot , '' by SeSor
Valdes	PERSON	; '' Cuentos Sacroprofanos , '' by
Sefiora Bazan	PERSON	; 44
Carmela Rediviva	PERSON	, '' by SeSor Matteu ; and the forthcoming * 4 Morsamor '' of Sefior Valera .

		Of poems and plays , none seem particularly important , and we are even told that `` Eche - garay has not succeeded in pleasing the public with any of his recent efforts . ''

		But it is inter - esting to note that there have been successful performances of such translated plays as the 44 Persse '' and the 4t Prometheus '' of ^ Eschylus , the `` Iphigenie auf Tauris '' of Goethe , and the '' Hamlet '' and 44 Twelfth Night '' -LRB- Cuento de Amor -RRB- of Shakespeare .

		POET , ARTIST-MANUFACTURER , AND SOCIALIST .

		* In writing the
Life of William Morris	ORGANIZATION	Mr.
Mackail	PERSON	has bad an unusually difficult biographical task .

		Morris 's career was many - stranded , and his unique and somewhat eccen - tric personality was one to tax the art and the discretion of the delineator .

		It is therefore particularly gratifying to find how well and satisfy ingly , with what patience , candor , and constructive skill , Mr.
Mackail	PERSON	has done his work .

		The spirit of truth , as well as of sym - pathy , has presided over his labors ; and it would scarcely be possible to tell the story of
William Morris	PERSON	's life and work more effec - tively and attractively than it is told in these two beautiful volumes .

		Mr.
Mackail	PERSON	has per - haps laid more stress upon and devoted more space to the doings and dream ings and literary and esthetic philanderings of
Morris	PERSON	and his set at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	than the American reader will think necessary .

		It may well be that the En - glish undergraduate is in general a more ma - ture and intellectually considerable creature than his American counterpart ; but at all events we are not accustomed here to take very seriously the performances of youths at col - lege , and their views on the deeper problems of life , art , and society .

		But Mr.
Mackail	PERSON	ap - pears to take
Morris	PERSON	and his young friends of the '' Brotherhood '' quite as seriously as they took themselves , which is saying a good deal .

		We have spoken of
Morris	PERSON	's career as `` many - stranded . ''

		Threefold would perhaps be the better term , for in regarding his pursuits or activities as a whole , his early and quickly abandoned essays as painter and as architect proper may be left out of view as incidental and abortive .

		It was as poet , artist-manufac - turer , and Socialist that
William Morris	PERSON	made his impression upon his time and is likely to live for a while in the world 's remembrance .

		His poetry began at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, and went on con - currently with his manufacturing during the greater part of his career .

		It may be added that evidence is not lacking that
Morris	PERSON	re - garded the manufacturing , the production of sound and artistic furniture , chintzes , wall - paper , carpets , and so on , as the worthier and more dignified of his two pursuits . ''

Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1899 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL and , in so far as poetry takes the form of a mere shell of verbal filigree and sham mediae - valism , we may largely agree with him .

		His Socialistic apostolate began relatively late , with the formation of the
Democratic Federation	ORGANIZATION	in
1883	DATE	, and had lapsed into a sort of passive Socialism , a philosophic repose on the bosom of the stream of tendency , toward
1890	DATE	, when reflection induced by experience of his col - leagues in the various organizations , and of the masses who were to be '' elevated '' -LRB- largely in spite of themselves , as he came to see -RRB- forced him to admit that the movement toward higher things must be a gradual one of educa - tion , of evolution , of normal and secular na - tional change , and not of active and immediate revolution and the overthrow of the existing social fabric through the use of the newly ac - quired lever of popular suffrage .

		Socialism , in fine , might be expected to come , in one form or another , when
England	LOCATION	had grown up to it , not before ; and , like the present system , could only prevail by virtue of being a reflection of actual English needs and capacities , in a word , of average English character .

		Morris , whose So - cialism was temperamental or emotional rather than a fruit of scientific study and conviction , though at one time he applied himself manfully to ` the doctrinal abstrusities of the authorities , was keenly touched by the hard lot of the poor .

		But , it is curious to note , the hard lot of the poor meant to his mind mainly the being cut off , to so great a degree , from the enjoyment of and the production of works of art !

		The wage-worker he characteristically conceived as a pathetic figure knocking in vain for admis - sion at the gates of the Palace of Art , which were closed against him by the ruthless hand of the '' profit-grinder . ''

		The
Birmingham	LOCATION	operative , the '' navvy , '' Devonshire ''
Giles	PERSON	, '' and even
London	LOCATION	'' ` Arry '' himself , were sup - posed to be yearning for that degree of grace - ful leisure which would enable them to enter freely into the joys of painted windows , medi - aeval brasses , illuminated folios , and -LRB- last but not least -RRB- the pictures of Kossetti and
Co.	ORGANIZATION	!

		Of course the cold fact was , and
Morris	PERSON	came to realize it , that the '' profit-grinder 's '' victim , in nine cases out of ten , did not care a rush for the Palace of Art , as compared with the beer - shop and the race-track .

		He even showed an ungrateful inclination to take a comic , not to say blackguardly , view of
Morris	PERSON	himself and his performances , to turn his outdoor meetings into occasions for starting an enjoyable row with the police , and to vaguely identify his preachings in behalf of the art - hungering masses with the corybantic exercises of the Sal - vation
Army	ORGANIZATION	.

		Morris used to recount in a serio-comic way instances of the unpleasant notoriety which his well-meant efforts gained for him .

		Jeers and insults at the hands of the very class he championed were hard to bear .

		Even the
Hammersmith	LOCATION	green-grocer 's boy , he wrote sadly , took to bawling '' Socialist !

		Morris ! ''

		in no flattering tones after him in the streets ; while passing '' ` Arrys , '' fertile in sarcasm , once added cuttingly to the usual epi - thet , '' Shakespeare , yah ! ''

		In short ,
Morris	PERSON	, taking to heart the lesson that
England	LOCATION	's '' lower class brutalized '' was scarcely ripe for his collectivistic millenium , with its superadded aesthetic refinements , and admitting the fact -LRB- palpable everywhere outside of Utopia -RRB- that the advent of a higher social system presup - poses the advent of a higher type of men , lat - terly eschewed militant Socialism , pinned his faith to education rather than agitation , and returned to his true province of creative art and artistic handicraft .

		His growing modera - tion and opportunism naturally offended his colleagues of the League ; and he soon found himself deposed from the control of its organ , the ''
Commonweal	LOCATION	, '' and replaced by one
Frank Kitz	PERSON	, an extremist of the ordinary type , who presently got the sheet and its managers into the hands of the police , who found it high time to repress its attacks on the principle of law and order and its constructive incitements to murder .

		The article that was the immediate cause of the ruin of the paper -LRB- which was already on the brink of ruin through lack of funds -RRB- was angrily characterized by
Morris	PERSON	as '' idiotic . ''

		Thus , while abandoning his early dream of regenerating
England	LOCATION	overnight and producing roses from her thorns and figs from her thistles through the spell of some legislative incantation or miracle of constitution-making ,
Morris	PERSON	by no means abandoned his faith in Socialism as an ideal of future approximation , as a goal toward which society is gradually tending . ''

		Some approach to it , '' he said , '' is sure to be tried . ''

		Morris 's inborn medievalism , let us note in passing , his habit of looking backward for canons and models of excellence , was oddly blended with a vein of thoroughgoing eight - eenth-century perfecibilitarianism , of faith in , the continuity and theoretically boundless pos - sibilities of human progress .

		With
Rousseau	PERSON	he turned for the Golden Age to the past ; with
Condorcet	LOCATION	he discerned it in the future .

		There is perhaps an inconsistency too -LRB- and 92 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, men of genius like
Morris	PERSON	must not be grudged their inconsistencies -RRB- in his supreme exaltation of an art that began and flourished amid the wide inequalities , the rigid class distinctions , of feudal society , and his doctrine that it is the kindred , though far less stringent , inequalities and distinctions of modern society that stunt and stifle art .

		Art can not flourish to-day be - cause of the survival of conditions under which it flourished so magnificently five centuries ago !

		It is not to be inferred from the fact of
Morris	PERSON	's abandonment of militant and aggres - sive Socialism that he thenceforth ingloriously sank into a comfortable , not to say an indolent , reliance on the virtues of laisser-fairc .

		The good work of sowing the seed of Socialism , he strenuously urged , must go on ; but the sower must arm his soul with patience , must be pre - pared to wait long for the harvest , nay , must be content to scatter the seed of a harvest which a generation yet unborn will reap .

		Education must be the watchword .

		In his final manifesto to the League , he says : '' ... I say for us to make Socialiit * is the business at present , and at present I do not think we can have any other useful business ... When we have enough people of that way of thinking , they will find out what action is necessary for putting their principles in prac - tice .

		Therefore , I say , make Socialists .

		We Socialists can do nothing else that is useful . ''

		This calm and reasoned counsel drew forth a volley of protest and abuse from the extrem - ists of the sect , who were already babbling of dynamite and open war upon society , and who had now awakened in
Scotland	LOCATION	Yard a languid interest in their proceedings , through their sage deliberations as to the ways and means for barricading the streets of
London	LOCATION	.

		But
Morris	PERSON	, says Mr.
Mackail	PERSON	, '' had already left the League , and the moment he did so it began to crumble away like sand , '' as in fact it must , since the withdrawal of
Morris	PERSON	meant the with - drawal of its main source of pecuniary sup - plies .

		Morris , let us say , was not one of that order of Socialists who have been described as yearning to do good with other people 's money .

		He was a liberal supporter , financially , of the various reforming organizations .

		But he was not , nevertheless , by any means what the world is used to call a liberal , an open-handed man .

		This statement brings us to a searching criti - cism of his character made by Mr.
Mackail	PERSON	, which serves not only to help us understand
Morris	PERSON	, but to exemplify Mr.
Mac-kail	PERSON	's com - mend ably fair and judicial attitude as a biog - rapher .

		Morris , holds Mr.
Mackail	PERSON	, was inter - ested in things much more than in people , in classes much more than in men .

		The thing done , whatever it might be , was what he cared about in the work of his contemporaries and friends no less than in that of other ages and countries .

		So too in the common concerns of life he was strangely incurious of individuals a quality of mind which took , on the one hand , the form of absolute indifference to gos - sip , and a capacity of working with the most dis - agreeable and jarring colleagues , so long as they were useful to the work in hand , and , on the other , of an almost equally marked inconsiderate - ness . ''

		For sympathy in distress , for aid in trouble , it was not to him one would have gone : '' The lot of the poor , as a class , when he thought of it , had always lain heavily on his spirit ... But the sufferings of individuals often only moved him to a cer - tain impatience .

		Many years before ,
Kossetti	PERSON	, in one of those flashes of hard insight that made him so ter - rible a friend , had said of him , ' Did you ever notice that Top -LRB-
Morris	ORGANIZATION	's nickname -RRB- never gives a penny to a beggar ? '

		Inconsiderate and even unscrupulous as
Rossetti	PERSON	was himself in some of the larger affairs of life , this particular instinct of generosity was one which never failed him .

		For the individual in distress were it a friend in difficulties , or some unknown poor woman on the streets he was always ready to empty his own pockets , and plunge deeply into those of his friends .


Morris	PERSON	's virtues were of a completely different type .

		... That habit of magnificence , which to the Greek mind was the crown of virtues , was
Kossetti	PERSON	's most re - markable quality .

		In the nature of
Morris	PERSON	it had no place . '

		I am bourgeois , you know , and therefore with - out the point of honor , ' be had written many years before to
Madox Brown	PERSON	in a moment of real self - appreciation ; and his virtues were therefore those of the bourgeois class industrious , honest , fair-minded up to their lights , but unexpansive and unsympathetic so far as the touch of genius did not transform him into something quite unique and incalculable . ''

		A unique figure in English life , in more ways than one ,
Morris	PERSON	certainly was ; and he paid the penalty of the offence of being un - like other people . ''

		As a pronounced -LRB- though entirely unaffected -RRB- social non-conformist he met with the usual obloquy and misconstruc - tion .


Morris	PERSON	did not care three straws for Mrs.
Grundy	PERSON	, and was indeed seemingly un - aware of her existence ; and Mrs.
Grundy	PERSON	fumed accordingly .

		He did what he liked and wore what he liked at
London	LOCATION	, just as he had read what he liked and worn '' purple trousers '' at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		British philistinism disapproved of him ; Podsnap shook his head at him ; ` Arry , '' as we have seen , jeered at him . ''

		I have had , '' he said , '' a life of insults and suoking of brains . ''

		English university education is mainly bent on the formation and conservation of a type , rather than on the detection and foster - ing of special individual gifts and capacities .

		1899 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL There is a certain academic mould into which each young gentleman is assiduously pressed during the period of his academic career ; and while the process is in average cases followed by desirable and agreeable results , it must prove a largely abortive , and may very con - ceivably prove a cramping and deadening pro- cess , in cases where , as in that of
Morris	PERSON	, it happens to run counter to the promptings and to block the line of natural expansion of genius .

		Morris derived little profit from the prescribed tasks at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	; and , says Mr.
Mackail	PERSON	: '' ... to the end of his life the educational system and the intellectual life of modern Oxford were mat - ters as to which he remained bitterly prejudiced , and the name of '
Don	PERSON	' was used by him as a synonym for all that was narrow , ignorant , and pedantic . ''

		But an '' Oxford man '' he nominally was ; and , therefore , as at once a man of means and
University	ORGANIZATION	education who deliberately kept a shop , a poet who chose to ply a handicraft , to weave , dye , and carve , not as a gentleman ama - teur , but under the usual conditions of handi - craftsman , he was to the average mind a figure so unique as to be scarcely comprehensible .

		Sir
E. Beckett	PERSON	once sarcastically called him the '' poet upholsterer '' ; but
Morris	PERSON	, who had no taint of the snob in his soul , and to whom the feelings of the snob were as unintelligible as his own feelings were to people like Sir
E. Beckett	PERSON	, calmly accepted the epithet as '' a harmless statement of fact , '' and seemed on the whole to plume himself more on his '' up - holstering '' than his poetry .

		That he should do so is hardly surprising when we reflect that the efforts of
William Morris	PERSON	to replace in En - gland the house hideous by the house beautiful resulted in a salutary and perhaps a saving revolution in her art-manufactures .

		It may be interesting to know what Mr.
Mackail	PERSON	has to say of the debate over the be - stowal of the laureateship in
1892	DATE	.

		The claims of
Morris	ORGANIZATION	, as based on the amount and quality of his poetic work , were of course such as could not be ignored .

		But his political views would have assorted strangely with his occupancy of the office , and it would have been difficult for those who knew him even slightly to seriously figure him as the official eulogist of the existing order and celebrant of its triumphs .

		Says the author : `` As regards his personal views on the matter , Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	, who had then just become for the fourth time Prime Minister , kept his own counsel : and it is matter of common knowledge that no recommendation was ever made by him to the Queen , and that the office remained unfilled for three years during his Govern - ment and the administration which succeeded it .

		But after this lapse of time it may not be indiscreet to say that
Morris	PERSON	was sounded by a member of the Cabinet , with Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	's approval , to ascertain whether he would accept the office in the event of its being offered to him .

		His answer was unhesitating .

		He was frankly pleased that it had been thought of , and did not under - value the implied honor : but it was one which his prin - ciples and tastes alike made it impossible for him to accept .

		The matter went no further .

		In private con - versation
Morris	PERSON	always held that the proper function of a Poet Laureate was that of a ceremonial writer of official verse , and that in this particular case the Mar - quis of Lome was the person pointed out for the office should the office be thought one worth keeping up under modern conditions by position and acquirements . ''

		Not the least interesting part of Mr.
Mac	PERSON	- kail 's book is the story of the inception and growth of the unique manufacturing business of
Morris and Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Characterizing
Morris	PERSON	as a manufacturer , Mr.
Mackail	PERSON	goes on to say : '' He carried on his business as a manufacturer not because he wished to make money , but because he wished to make the things he manufactured .

		The art of commerce as it consists in buying material and labor cheaply , and forcing the largest possible sale of the product , was one for which he had little aptitude and less liking .

		In every manual art which he touched , he was a skilled expert : in the art of money-making he remained to the last an amateur .

		Throughout he re - garded material with the eye of an artist , and labor with the eye of a fellow-laborer .

		He never grudged or hag - gled over the price of anything which he thought really excellent of its kind and really desirable for him to have ; he would dye with kermes instead of cochineal if he could gain an almost imperceptible richness of tone by doing so : he would condemn piece after piece of his man - ufacture that did not satisfy his own severe judgment . ''

		Mrs.
Kitchie	PERSON	thus describes a visit to the shop in its early and rudimentary days : '' I perfectly remember going with
Val Prinsep	ORGANIZATION	one foggy morning to some square , miles away ; we came into an empty ground-floor room , and Val Prinsep called Topsy ! '

		very loud , and someone came from above with hair on end and in a nonchalant way began to show one or two of bis curious , and to my uninitiated soul , bewildering treasures .

		I think
Morris	PERSON	said the glasses would stand firm when he put them on the table .

		I bought two tumblers of which Val Prinsep praised the shape .

		He and Val wrapped them up in paper , and I came away very much amused and interested , with a general impression of sympathetic shyness and shadows and dim green glass . ''

		Mr.
Mackail	PERSON	has given us a model biog - raphy , and the publishers have issued it in a form that the fastidious taste of its hero would have approved .

		There are several excellent por - traits of
Morris	ORGANIZATION	, and Mr.
New	PERSON	's drawings are capital in themselves and have a certain sugges - tion of special adaptation in point of style or treatment to their setting and occasion .

		A few plates illustrative of
Morris	ORGANIZATION	's designing might have formed a desirable addition to the pictorial attractions of the work .

		* The interesting and important work upon the epic of the Finns , the
Kalevala	LOCATION	, by the Italian scholar Comparetti , appeared in Italian in
1891	DATE	and in German in
1892	DATE	.

		It now pre - sents itself to us in a smooth and comely En - glish dress , and Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	makes the introduction .

		A complete English translation of the poem itself , by an American scholar , Mr.
John Martin Crawford	PERSON	, was published at
New York	LOCATION	in
1888	DATE	.

		The English translation of Comparetti vio - lates literary ethics by appearing without an index , though the table of contents is somewhat full .

		I shall therefore give some page-refer - ences .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's own book , '' Homer and the Epic , '' which contains a short chapter about the
Kalevala	LOCATION	, has no index and the briefest pos - sible table of contents .

		When will scholars take up the bookmaker 's burden , and see to it that their volumes are published in a usable form ?

		The Kalevala has usually been looked upon '' as an ancient national epos , orally preserved by tradition , and collected from the mouths of the people , principally by Lonnrot '' -LRB- p. 10 -RRB- .

		In point of fact it was in many ways constructed by
Lonnrot	LOCATION	, not simply collected .

		The idea of combining the folk-songs of the Finns which treat the same or related subjects was first sug - gested to this scholar by the popular singers themselves , who feel free to combine several songs into a larger whole .

		Lonnrot finally went far beyond this , and attempted to weave into a great unified poem all that was most interesting and significant in the entire mass of Finnish folk-poetry .

		To do this he made alterations in the ballads somewhat freely , though in most cases he either followed some one of the various versions of the particular song , or at least made changes that could easily be paralleled from the actual folk-poetry .

		The unity of the Kalevala thus obtained , however , is something very imperfect ; sometimes there is very little attempt to unify the various stories -LRB- p. 144 -RRB- ; at times fundamental inconsistencies have been allowed to remain -LRB- pp. 148 , 847 ^ * . -RRB-

		; and what unity exists is often external rather than intrinsic .

		Chapter III .

		of Part I. , '' The Composition of the Kalevala , '' tells in detail just how Lbnnrot built up the great poem from the materials furnished him in the folk-songs .

		This is perhaps the most interesting portion of the book .

		We learn here how it happens that the story of the making of the first harp from the bones of the great pike and of the exquisite singing of Wainamoinen -LRB- Runes 40 , 41 -RRB- is followed later by the loss of this harp -LRB- close of Rune 42 -RRB- and the making of a second from the sacred birch-tree -LRB- Rune 44 -RRB- .

		In reality , no Finnish singer knows of two harps .

		The loss of the first instrument was a pure invention of
Lonnrot	LOCATION	, in order that he might thereby weave into his poem another charming version of the origin of the harp .

		The changing of the tears of Wainamoinen into sea-pearls -LRB- Rune 41 -RRB- is a striking incident which seems to have originated wholly with
Lonnrot	PERSON	-LRB- p. 156 ; see also p. 257 concerning the making of the
Sampo	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The magic song , or charm , is the funda - mental product of Finnish folk-poetry -LRB- pp. 24 , 187 , 232 -RRB- ; the interesting belief that one who recites correctly the account of the origin of any evil force takes away thereby its power for harm -LRB- pp. 27 , 229 -RRB- explains why these magic songs are narrative in form , and sug - gests in a strange way the wise philosophy of
Bacon	LOCATION	.

		The Finns are perhaps the only people who have produced poetry of a high degree of excellence while still believing in the uni - versal efficacy of magic -LRB- p. 24 -RRB- .

		The aesthetic power of song seems to be a later conception -LRB- p. 821 -RRB- .

		The hero in this poetry is the wiz - ard , the magician -LRB- pp. 172 , 185 , 230 -RRB- .

		The deeds of separate hero-wizards make up the poem ; '' no peoples or social masses appear in collective action or in conflict '' -LRB- pp. 22 / ' .

		, 329 -RRB- .

		The thoroughly non-historical character of the
Kalevala	LOCATION	is a constant surprise to the student whose ideas have been formed by read - ing the other great folk-epics -LRB- pp. 23 , 60 , 246 , 329 -RRB- . ''

		The Finns of
Russia	LOCATION	and of the Russian church are still quite illiterate and in a state of primitive simplic - ity ; among them the tradition of the songs has remained singularly fresh .

		For the genuine traditional rune is in

Lake Onega	LOCATION	to
Lake Ladoga	LOCATION	'' -LRB- p. 311 -RRB- .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's main interest in the
Kalevala	LOCATION	and in the work of
Comparetti	ORGANIZATION	is because of the light thrown by them upon the broader Homeric question , better called the epic ques - tion , the problem concerning the mode of origin of the world 's great national epics .

		In - deed , this larger question was probably the especial stimulus which led Comparetti him - self to study the epic of the Finns .

		The reason why this problem is an endless one is not far to seek .

		Since
Wolf	PERSON	in
1795	DATE	advocated the view that the Iliad was put to - gether from separate songs , two tendencies have been clearly developed in the theorizings con - cerning the origin of folk-epics .

		One tendency accents the element of folk-poetry , popular poetry , as the fundamental fact .

		Since most popular poetry is narrative , and this exists almost entirely in the form of separate ballads , this view makes much of the individual folk - songs , and makes little of the grave difficulties which confront one who tries to explain how any particular epic was put together from these elements .

		These difficulties are somewhat mitigated by the theory that the Iliad , for ex - ample , existed at one time as a simpler though complete poem , a primary Iliad , to which suc - cessive additions have been made .

		We must remember , also , that in folk-poetry itself we find ballads combined into larger compositions .

		The English '' Gest of
Robin Hood	PERSON	'' is ad - mitted to be a composite of different ballads .

		Compound ballads are well-known to the Finns .

		Comparetti gives one which corresponds to five different runes of the
Kalevala	LOCATION	and parts of three others -LRB- pp. 158 ^ . -RRB-

		.

		It is somewhat mis - leading , therefore , to suggest that no '' song existing independently ever figures in a large poem '' -LRB- viii . -RRB-

		.

		The second tendency in explaining the origin of popular epics is to accent the element of plan and the organic unity of the great mass of material , and either to overlook the precedent folk-songs or at least to minimize their import - ance .

		The origin of a popular epic , however , can not possibly be explained without the pres - ence in some measure of both factors , the creative but unconscious folk-spirit and the con - scious master-poet .

		Inasmuch as folk-poetry can not flourish except in a society uncultured and free from self-consciousness , incapable of observing and reporting the phenomena of its own mental life , both the general problem and that with reference to each particular epic be - come impossible of exact solution .

		The import - ance of the Kalevala in this line of inquiry is very great , since it is '' the only example we have of a national poem actually resulting from minor songs ; these songs being not discovera - ble in it according to some preconceived idea by means of inductive analysis , but known as really existing independently of the large composi - tion '' -LRB- ix . -RRB-

		.

		Lonnrot thought himself to be a Finnish Homer , composing the epic of his race from their stores of song .

		Comparetti points out that
Lonnrot	PERSON	, though a folk-poet at heart , was also a scholar , filled with modern theoriz - ings concerning the making of popular epics -LRB- p. 340 -RRB- ; and '' the processes of such a man are no argument for early
Greece	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Lang	ORGANIZATION	, xvi . -RRB-

		.

		Moreover , although Lbnnrot alters and trans - poses with great freedom , and sometimes inserts original passages , the
Kalevala	LOCATION	comes far short of possessing a unity like that of the Iliad or the Odyssey .

		Though charming in all its parts , the Finnish epic , when considered as a whole , remains in many respects a piece of patchwork .

		There can be no doubt , I think , that Mr.
Lang	PERSON	underestimates the importance of the folk element in the Homeric poems .

		He says , using in part the language of Comparetti : '' In my opinion the maker of the Iliad did just what was done by the maker of The Lay of the
Last Minstrel	LOCATION	.

		Out of his knowledge of facts or fancies , as existing in lays and traditions , he fashioned a long poem with be - ginning , middle , and end , with organic unity , harmony , proportion of parts coordinated among themselves , and converging towards a final catastrophe ' '' -LRB- xxi . -RRB-

		.

		But the two cases are far from parallel .

		The conception of a body of songs concerning the Trojan War , which give an accurate version of the events , is distinctly assumed in the Odyssey itself -LRB- Bk. , i. 11 .

		350 j. , viii .

		74J. , 489J. , 500 S -RRB- ; without insisting that this conception is correct for the lifetime of an actual Odysseus , it seems clear that the nature of the popular liter - ature in existence at the time when the Odys - sey was composed made this conception appear natural and unquestionable .

		Comparetti declares : '' A long poem , created by the people , does not exist , can not exist ; epic popular songs , such as could be put together into a true poem , have never been seen and are not likely to be seen among any people '' -LRB- p. 352 -RRB- .

		This seems extreme in view of what a Russian scholar named
Radloff	PERSON	has told us about the popular poetry of a Turkish tribe , 96 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, the Kara-Kirghis .

		* These people dwell among the mountains of
Central Asia	LOCATION	, in the general neighborhood of
Lake Issyk-kul	LOCATION	and the city of
Kashgar	LOCATION	, near the westernmost border of the
Chinese Empire	ORGANIZATION	.

		The poetry of this tribe , according to liadloff , is still '' in a certain ori - ginal period which is best called the genuinely epic period , that same period in which the Greeks were found when their epio songs of the Trojan war were not yet written , but lived in the form of genuine folk-poetry in the mouths of the people . ''

		The national feeling of the Kara-Kirghis '' has united separate epic songs into one undivided whole ... the different traditions and stories , historical recollections , tales , and ballads , as though in obedience to some force of attraction combine about an epic centre and in all their dismemberment appear parts of a comprehensive general picture . '' ''

		Only a people which has not reached indi - vidual culture , '' says
Radloff	PERSON	, '' can create bards from its midst and develop a period of contem - poraneous epic .

		With the spread of culture '' come '' rhapsodists who do not compose them - selves but sing songs borrowed from others . ''

		Radloff cites the following passage from
Stein	PERSON	- thai : f '' Up to
1832	DATE	no one knew of a whole Finnish epic ... No one had knowledge of the unity , and yet ... it was existent in the songs themselves . ''

		Radloff comments on this as follows : '' From this I venture only to con - clude that among the Finns in the year
1832	DATE	the period of contemporaneous epic -LRB- as it now exists among the Kara-Kirghis -RRB- was already past .

		In the epic period the consciousness of the unity of the epic is still living in each por - tion of the whole . ''

		It must be admitted that so far as
Radloff	PERSON	enters into details concerning the poetry of the Kara-Kirghis , the epic unity which binds to - gether the various songs of the tribe seems to be somewhat loose and vague ; but it seems clear that a real unity is felt , and that Com - paretti has gone too far in the assertion cited above .

		The following comprehensive state - ment of Comparetti seems entirely just ; but I take the liberty to emphasize two adjectives : '' In proportion as the epic songs unite to form a wide , well - defined and stable organism , strictly popular and collective work is lost sight Proben der Volkslitteratnr der nbrdlichen ttirkuchen SULmme .

		It is a striking fact that the most important poems in English which have some right to be regarded as epics of art approximate closely to the folk-epic in some essential respects . ''

		Sig - urd the Volsnng , '' by
William Morris	PERSON	, is a fas - cinating re-telling in a continuous poem of the various
Eddie	PERSON	poems concerning
Sigurd	PERSON	and of the prose
Volsunga Saga	ORGANIZATION	.

		The poet makes no attempt to remove all the difficulties and inconsistencies which he found in his sources .

		The story which
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	chose for his theme in '' The Idylls of the King '' took its rise in remote Celtic tradition , and , becoming later a literary tradition , had attracted other stories to itself and had been fashioned and re-fashioned in countless ways centuries before
Tennyson	PERSON	.

		The general story of Milton 's '' Paradise Lost '' was first told in a form destined to dominate subsequent writers , by
Bishop Avitus	PERSON	of
Vienne	LOCATION	, about 500 A.D. , in his Latin epic poem , `` De Spiritalis Historiae Gestis . ''

		Professor
Marsh	PERSON	of
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	tells us that this poem was itself the outcome of a precedent poetic tradition , and that it was especially poetical and powerful '' largely because Avitus made use freely and skilfully of what his predeces - sors had done . ''

		* Yet Avitus wrote nearly 1200 years before
Milton	PERSON	.

		Some of the more important English versions of this story be - tween Avitus and
Milton	PERSON	are to be found in the poems formerly attributed to
Caedmon	LOCATION	, in the
Cursor Mundi	ORGANIZATION	^ and in the cycles of mys - tery plays .

		The last editor of '' Paradise Lost , '' Mr.
Moody	PERSON	, in his admirable ''
Cambridge Milton	PERSON	, '' discusses only the different
Renais	PERSON	- sance poems which treat of the Fall of Man and which may have directly influenced
Milton	PERSON	.

		If we bear in mind the entire tradition , the following words of Mr.
Moody	PERSON	become so much more expressive : In a '' restricted but still significant sense ,
Paradise Lost	ORGANIZATION	is a ' natural epic , ' with a law of growth like that of Beo - wulf * or the Iliad . ''

		We can say in general that the two concep - tions , that of an epic with a story wholly invented by its author , so far as invention is possible , and that of one made up of folk-songs unaltered but arranged in the most effective order , are the polar opposites of each other .

		It is probably impossible that a large , impres - sive , and unified poem , one which we could properly term an epic , a masterpiece of grand narrative , could approximate very closely to Article on Avitus ,

		THE DIAL 97 either of these poles .

		Among all the epics accessible to the general reader , the
Kalevala	LOCATION	comes nearest to one of these extremes , that of a simple arrangement of folk-songs .

		The first volume of the work of Abercromby is mainly occupied in discussing the geograph - ical distribution , the craniology , and the pre - historic civilization of the Finns .

		The last chapter of this volume treats of the beliefs of the West Finns as exhibited in their magic songs ; while the second volume is almost entirely occu - pied by a translation of a very large portion of the great collection of magic songs published by Lonnrot in
1880	DATE	.

		The lover of the
Kalevala	LOCATION	can here study in English some of the original materials from which that epic was made .

		Political happenings also call our attention at present to
Finland	LOCATION	.

		Since
Russia	LOCATION	wrested this district from
Sweden	LOCATION	in
1809	DATE	, the inhabi - tants have enjoyed more freedom and a better government than any other portion of the empire .

		But now their cherished rights are being taken away , and the Finns are appeal - ing to the civilized world for sympathy and moral support .

		Would that the recent acts of our own republic had not taken away from us the right and the power to speak out effectively in behalf of freedom and self - government for the distressed Finns !

		This work is especially pleasing and valuable to the historian and to the lover of Colonial associations .

		If taken in the spirit of one of

		As a setting for incidents in Colonial history , it is not only consistent , but necessary , in order that a complete idea of the lives of our fore - fathers may be obtained .

		* THE GEORGIAN PERIOD .

		Being Measured Drawings of Colonial Work .

		Boston :
American Architect and Building News Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		To the architect , this volume is also useful if viewed in a reminiscent way .

		He must dis - criminate between that which is straightfor - ward and unaffected and that which is mere adaptation .

		The architect who looks beyond many of the Colonial porches to the simple and dignified walls , with their well-proportioned openings , will find much value in these plates .

		Our meaning is illustrated by the very first plate in the collection , in which the portion which it is meant to illustrate -LRB- the porch -RRB- is the least valuable part ; while the background -LRB- the house -RRB- is charming in its straightforwardness and simplicity .

		The perspective sketches of the
Royal Mansion	ORGANIZATION	, by Mr.
Deane	PERSON	, give a Col - onial atmosphere which we moderns would do well to emulate , much more than do the meas - ured drawings of details of the same building which follow .

		Architects should not go to such sources for their classic detail .

		If they are unable to relate their detail to the time and the conditions under which they work , and feel that they must go to precedent , it is much safer for them to go to that period which was the guiding one for our Colonial ancestors .

		The value of this work is therefore suggestive rather than literal .

		We should not use it as an ency - clopaedia of definite forms and proportions .

		We must use it rather as an encouragement and inspiration along the lines of simple straight - forward design .

		To put it more tersely , the measured drawings are very apt to do our thinking for us , whereas we should compel our architects to make an independent problem of every commission that is given them .

		The Colonial church is a delightful building to enter .

		When there , we step back into the
last century	DATE	.

		There is danger , however , if our architects accept this model , that they will ignore the increasing democratic tendencies and the changes in ecclesiastical forms which have come upon us since those churches were built .

		The architect who would do the parallel thing , emulating in the best way the examples left by the architects of these churches , would realize the institutional character which is to govern our churches in the future , and would give his building the same relation to that institutional and democratic tendency that those Colonial churches have to the Colonial times with which they most charmingly correspond .

		Through this delightful series , many Colo - nial mantels are shown .

		They are , most of them , faithful applications of classic or renais - sance architecture as designed for stone ; and as such they fail .

		If one turns to Plate 26 , THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, and notes the plain mantel in the living-room of the Fairbanks house , he will find a spirit of directness , a consistent use of material , with simplicity and harmonious proportions ; and that sheet alone would justify the publication of this work .

		Combined as it is with the pho - tographic reproduction of the exterior , it makes one of the most valuable portions of the volume .

		The plate giving the
Jonathan Childs	PERSON	house in
Rochester	LOCATION	shows a detail of the porch which is very faithfully worked out , and may be use - ful if one wishes to build for archaeological or museum purposes .

		It is distinctly stone archi - tecture , it implies a temple , and it is not con - sistent when executed in wood or used as a dwelling ; and it is to this problem of consist - ency that we would especially bring the atten - tion of our architects .

		It has often been said that art is most free when its media are most restricted .

		Compar - ison between Plate No. 1 , Part II. , on one hand , and the iron work shown on Plates 27 ` and 30 , Part II. , will illustrate this point .

		Our early Colonial builders had planes which enabled them to copy stone forms in wood ; and the result was a debased art .

		But at the same time they did not have such power over iron .

		The railing referred to , which is in the
New York City Hall	LOCATION	, is distinctly an iron railing .

		It is the work of a man with hammer and anvil ; and being compelled by the nature of the material to work along more or less orig - inal lines , the designer , either consciously or unconsciously , depended upon beautiful line , good proportion , proper spacing , proper bal - ance between straight lines and curved lines , and thus he produced a beautiful thing .

		He gave another example of the power of independent thought combined with artistic perception .

		In Part No .

		III. , Plate 6 , the sketches by Mr.
Gregg	PERSON	give us a delightful historic sug - gestion .

		Plate 30 gives us a charming glimpse of
Providence	LOCATION	life .

		Plate 16 is an illustration of what we would have our architects avoid .

		It is a mantel designed in stone and executed in wood , and covered with draperies from some antique funeral .

		There is a certain refinement , which we must admit , in the character of the moulding , but we should compel our architects to work with equal refinement along progres - sive lines .

		To be consistent they should derive the motives for their geometrical and conven - tional ornament from the plants , animals , or things of any nature that we love and with which we surround ourselves .

		CONGRESSIONAL REGULATION OF COMMERCE .

		* A treatise upon one clause of the Constitu - tion of the
United States	LOCATION	is an innovation , but a wholesome and serviceable one .

		The clause selected in this instance is the one by which the people of
America	LOCATION	sought to remedy that evil in their former system of government which , of all others , they seemed to feel most deeply .

		It was a consultation between certain States as to the best means of securing a gen - eral commercial system , which proved the ini - tial step toward the Constitutional Convention of
1787	DATE	.

		To provide remedial measures in this respect , it was suggested that a convention be assembled for the purpose of amending the Articles of Union ; and that assembly , when convened , prepared the frame of constitution which the people afterward adopted .

		The pro- vision committing to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	the power to regulate foreign and domestic commerce did not for several decades excite friction sufficient to call for the interposition of the courts .

		By reason of this , the lines of demarkation between the proper province of
State	ORGANIZATION	legislation upon commercial subjects , and the field within which power was given to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, were for a long time not clearly seen .

		The States , legislating over subjects incidental and germane to com - merce , often passed laws which in fact assumed to regulate commerce .

		But in time it became necessary for the Federal courts to interfere , and to expound the '' Commerce Clause . ''

		In
1823	DATE	, the legislation of
South Carolina	LOCATION	against the introduction of free negroes into that
State	ORGANIZATION	was , by Mr.
Justice Johnson	PERSON	in the
United States Circuit Court	ORGANIZATION	, declared to be an infringe - ment upon the exclusive power of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	to regulate commerce .

		In
1824	DATE	,
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	of the
United States	LOCATION	declared void the legislation of
New York	LOCATION	which gave to
Robert Fulton	PERSON	and his associates the monopoly of nav - igating public waters with the lately perfected steamboats .

		Since then , the occasions have been numerous for similar interpositions by the courts between the action of
State Legis	LOCATION	- latures and the constitutional powers of Con - gress .

		Only one other clause of the

		THE DIAL 99 a treatise on the
Commerce Clause	ORGANIZATION	of the Constitution which will be instructive , not to lawyers alone , but to all who have observed the wonderful development of commercial spirit and enterprise in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		As im - portant as are the Police power and the Taxing power of the States , in our Federal system , and as efficiently as these powers are sustained by the Federal courts , they are required to yield precedence and are subordinated to the Com - merce power of the central government when - ever they are found to be in conflict with it .

		The theories by which these sometimes warring powers are adjusted to harmonious action will interest all students of our national institutions .

		The various subjects in respect to which the Congressional power is exercised namely , the control of navigable waters , port regulations , carriers , rates , and taxation are treated by the authors in separate chapters , and as to each the course of jurisprudence is traced in its de - velopment .

		The question whether the consti - tutional grant of power to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	is ipso facto exclusive of
State	ORGANIZATION	action , when not exer - cised by
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, has been variously answered by the Federal courts .

		The vacillations of judicial opinion on this feature of the subject are traced instructively in this treatise .

		The history of the development of judicial opinion concerning the
Commerce Clause	ORGANIZATION	, as here presented , is disappointing in one respect .

		The authors advocate the untenable theory that the
United States	LOCATION	did not become a Nation until made so by the results of the Civil War .

		Politicians and partisans often find this a con - venient postulate .

		But the jurisprudence of our country confutes the proposition , and the constitutional arguments which rest upon it prove to be misleading .

		Our authors assume that '' the issue of the Civil War finally estab - lished , on a new basis , the relations between the states and the federal government , '' and add : '' We pass from the old regime to the new , not by the slow processes of judicial construction , but at a single step , as the national sovereignty which the war established as a fact is given place in the constitutional law of the nation by the decisions of the Court . ''

		From these premises the conclusion is easily drawn that the post-bellum decisions of
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	under the
Commerce Clause	ORGANIZATION	, in respect to national and
State	ORGANIZATION	action on com - mercial subjects , have worked a great change '' in the construction of the Federal powers . ''

		To enforce this theory the authors say , '' In
Crandall	PERSON	v.
Nevada	LOCATION	-LRB-
1867	DATE	-RRB- may be found the substance of what was accomplished by that great struggle .

		All the triumph of the armies of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	breathes in its stately judgment that ' the people of these
United States	LOCATION	constitute one nation . ' ''

		But in fact , so far as the Federal jurisprudence is concerned , that doctrine is one of its earliest principles .

		In the case of
Chisholm v. Georgia	ORGANIZATION	,
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	in
1793	DATE	delivered its stately judgment , answering affirmatively the question , '' Do the people of the
United States	LOCATION	form a Nation ? ''

		This principle has continuously been adhered to by the courts , and it formed the basis of the early decisions in respect to the
Commerce Clause	ORGANIZATION	in
1823	DATE	and
1824	DATE	, above mentioned .

		In the light of constitutional juris - prudence , the
United States	LOCATION	has always been a Nation , and the war worked no change in this respect .

		What it did accomplish was to silence the murmurs of discontent against the settled law of the land .

		How misleading is the theory adopted in this treatise may be seen in the attempt to prove it , as to the
Commerce Clause	ORGANIZATION	and the law applicable thereto , by the case of
Crandall	PERSON	v.
Nevada	LOCATION	.


The Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	in that case declined to apply the
Commerce Clause	ORGANIZATION	, but based its decision upon the consti - tutional rights which appertain to
United States	LOCATION	citizenship .

		To illustrate its views , the court in this
Nevada	LOCATION	case quoted with approval from an opinion of
Chief Justice Taney	ORGANIZATION	, given in
1848	DATE	, sustaining the constitutional rights of citizens of the
United States	LOCATION	, and declaring that '' For all the great purposes for which the Federal government was formed , we are one people , with one common country . ''

Aug. 16	DATE	, more than a hundred years had made as its proudest boast its haughty indifference to the temptation of territorial conquest , suddenly abjured its secular creed , and concluded a war upon which it had en - tered with every protestation of absolute disinter - estedness by annexations so sweeping as to invest the
United States	LOCATION	with all that was left of the her - itage of imperial
Spain	LOCATION	. ''

		Against this he sets a paragraph of equal length describing the military autocracy which now heads the world in an overt expression of the love for peace .

		Mr.
William A. Johnston	PERSON	, who is an editorial writer for the
New York	LOCATION	'' Herald , '' begins his '' His - tory up to Date '' with the statement that '' This book is a concise account of the birth of a new era in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		It is a record of the dying moments of the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	, the spirit that for more than one hundred years inspired the civic body born in the Revolution of the American Col - onies of
Great Britain	LOCATION	near the end of the last cen - tury . ''

		It is hardly necessary to recall that the
United States	LOCATION	has recently annexed
Hawaii	LOCATION	in the face of a majority of its inhabitants ; that it has had in
the Philippines	LOCATION	a larger army than
King George	LOCATION	ever imported into its own territories during the Revolution , engaged in teaching the people there that governments do not derive their just rights from the consent of the governed ; that , with the Declaration of Independence and the
Monroe Doc	PERSON	- trine , the injunctions of
Washington	LOCATION	's
Farewell Address	ORGANIZATION	and
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's
Gettysburg	LOCATION	Speech have been disregarded , the fear of standing armies wiped away , and the solemn pledges of the
Nation	ORGANIZATION	thrown aside , with all the teachings of its former history and best tradition .

		As a consequence , Mr.
Stead	PERSON	observed the rep - resentatives of the
United States	LOCATION	at the
Hague	LOCATION	in the interests of peace when their country is actu - ally engaged in a war against the independence of a people armed by itself , and proposing a method of international arbitration in the face of its own flat and unexplained refusal to arbitrate its differ - ences with
Spain	LOCATION	when that unhappy nation pleaded for it .

		And the American who remains at home finds other things not less contradictory and strange , all of them indicating that the methods of
Europe	LOCATION	, which made us great only because for a century and a quarter of national life they were carefully avoided , are now to make us greater by our adopting them in minute detail .

		And over all the wrench given our institutions is spread a pall of silence , the re - fusal on the part of the Government of the
United States	LOCATION	to make known the truth in respect of its military or other operations in its newly conquered territories , and the refusal of the dominant political party to permit any expression of dissent from a policy which
Russia	LOCATION	itself sees that the world has fairly outgrown .

		These considerations make the majority of these books dismal and unsatisfactory reading .

		Mr.
Stead	PERSON	's work is the result of an extended journey through continental
Europe	LOCATION	, and while it speaks with no uncertain voice for peace , it finds in the prospect of a united
Europe	LOCATION	the best means of meeting the new menace to the world 's harmony in the form of the
Great Republic	ORGANIZATION	militant .

		Through - out the capitals of the great powers he found an increasing feeling that the burden of war was grow - ing too heavy to be borne , armaments over there causing an expenditure almost as great as the bribes offered to the American electorate in the form of pensions in the case of several of the nations involved .

		His argument is carried to its logical conclusion by Mr.
Farrer	PERSON	's New Leviathan , '' in which is shown the curious fact that socialism and other means for the elimination of national bound - aries have their rise in the very standing armies created for the insurance of national feeling .

		The work of Messrs.
McCabe	PERSON	and
Darien	LOCATION	, '' Can We Disarm ? ''

		takes the question on its economical side and returns a cautious answer , seeing in the return to civil life of the present array of soldiery , and in the disturbance to manufactures caused by the cessation of the demand for warlike material , a double objection not to be lightly overcome .

		And Dr.
Trueblood	PERSON	's '' Federation of the World '' is , again , a plea for the world-wide solidarity which Kant dreamed of and
Tennyson	PERSON	sang : well consid - ered , logical , cogent , conclusive , and , in the light of
America	LOCATION	's present attitude , impossible .

		Mr.
Johnston	PERSON	's history is , of all issued so far , the only one which pretends to philosophy .

		Though himself carried away by the glamour of empire , he is not wholly blinded to the possibilities of the overthrow of our national inheritance .

		His work is succinct , never discursive , manifestly fair as such histories are , but not sufficiently extended to take in the present struggle for liberty on behalf of the Filipinos .

		The other books , without exception , point to the fact that
Russia	LOCATION	is merely the leader of a sentiment toward disarmament which i - grow - ing rapidly in all the world outside the
United States	LOCATION	except in some of the adjacent countries , like
Mexico	LOCATION	, which are arming in fear of this coun - try 's present sinister attitude .

		All serve to empha - size the shameful fact that lack of statesmanship in
America	LOCATION	permits us to clamor for empire to extend our trade in the face of a tariff designed for no pur - pose but to prevent it now carried to its logical and unconstitutional extremity in being raised against
Puerto Rico	LOCATION	; in blaming
Russia	LOCATION	for wrest - ing autonomy from
Finland	LOCATION	, while we are seeking to deprive the
Philippines	LOCATION	and
Cuba	LOCATION	of all govern - ment not based upon the sword ; of preaching the benefits of a republic , when we deny , either actu - ally or theoretically , our suffrage to all who are not of the white race ; of advocating arbitration after engaging in a war in which we had refused it ; and of interesting ourselves in international disarma - ment at the very moment we are increasing our standing army and navy to an extent unprecedented in our history .

		THE DIAL 101 BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS .

		Mr.
N. A. Jennings	PERSON	's lively account Experiences of a o f hig experiences as `` A
Texas Texas Ranger	ORGANIZATION	.

		f Hanger -LRB- ocribner -RRB- forms a capital yarn , a rather perilous one , we should think , to put in the hands of a boy of adventurous tastes .

		When we say `` yarn '' we do n't mean to hint a doubt of Mr.
Jennings	PERSON	's veracity .

		On the contrary , we find reason to think that he has been , as he claims , a veritable '' Ranger , '' a hunter of outlaws , in the storied days when the Lone Star State was the paradise of gentlemen who lived as they listed and died with their boots on .

		Mr.
Jennings	PERSON	went out to
Texas	LOCATION	, a youth of eighteen , in
1874	DATE	.

		He was the home-bred son of a
Philadelphia	LOCATION	merchant , enticed from the sober ideals of the city of broad - brims by the lurid articles of
Colonel J. A. Knox	PERSON	, in the ''
Texas	LOCATION	New Yorker . ''

		Colonel
Knox	PERSON	's paper assured Mr.
Jennings	PERSON	that he need only go to
Texas	LOCATION	to become a cattle-king and the owner of a county or so of land ; so he set out , with his father 's bless - ing and one hundred dollars in cash , to take pos - session .

		Arrived at
San Antonio	LOCATION	, his
$ 100	MONEY	had shrunk to
$ 3.25	MONEY	.

		A Mexican gaming-house relieved him of this last shot in the locker ; and a brief career of '' cow-punching , '' clerking , filibustering , and what not , followed .

		At last Mr.
Jennings	PERSON	succeeded in joining the famous '' Rangers , '' under Captain
McNelly	PERSON	, with which corps he served until late in
1879	DATE	.

		The story of his adventures is simply and graphically told , and it gives one a very fair idea of the character of the
Rangers	ORGANIZATION	, as well as of the more famous of the desperadoes who were '' wanted '' by the authorities for one atrocious crime or another .

		In his opening chapter the author bears witness to the great change for the better in the social conditions of
Texas	LOCATION	, since the seventies . ''

		In no
State	ORGANIZATION	in the
Union	ORGANIZATION	is the law more respected than it is in
Texas	LOCATION	to-day . ''

		Mr.
Jennings	PERSON	has in some instances changed the names of persons introduced in the narrative ; for , he sig - nificantly says : '' During a recent visit to
Texas	LOCATION	, for the purpose of going over the scenes of the ad - ventures of early days , I found a number of highly respected citizens , living exemplary lives , who had formerly been eagerly hunted by officers of the law . ''

		Mr.
Fisher Unwin	PERSON	's '' Library of Literary History , '' of which the Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	are the American publishers , has proved thus far to be an extremely creditable undertaking .

		Mr.
Frazer	PERSON	's '' Literary History of
India	LOCATION	, '' which opened the series , has already been noticed by us , and there now comes to our table '' A Literary History of
Ireland	LOCATION	, '' by Dr.
Douglas Hyde	PERSON	.

		An interesting announcement is that of `` A Literary History of the
United States	LOCATION	, '' by Professor
Barrett Wendell	PERSON	.

		The publishers and editors have been well advised in placing the pre - paration of the present volume in the hands of Dr.
Hyde	PERSON	, who is probably the most competent scholar The literary history of
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		living for the performance of such a piece of work .

		His acquaintance with the subject is both extensive and profound , and he is the master of a polished and interesting style .

		Moreover , the distinction between '' A Literary History of
Ireland	LOCATION	'' and a '' History of Irish Literature '' gives the author suit - able latitude for the development of his theme .

		Had his subject taken the latter form , this big book of six hundred and fifty pages could hardly have been justified ; as it is , the author remains within legiti - mate bounds , and is yet free to express himself fully .

		A '' Literary History of
Irish Ireland	LOCATION	'' he himself calls the book , for he has nothing to say of what was done by Swift ,
Goldsmith	PERSON	, and
Burke	PERSON	, but confines himself to writings in the vernacular .

		The book is largely the history of an unprinted lit - erature a literature preserved only in manuscripts and oral tradition .

		Over a thousand such manu - scripts are known , with contents extending to per - haps twenty thousand pieces of all lengths , from the single quatrain to the epic saga .

		It was less than twenty years ago when , in the author 's own alma mater , a popular lecturer said , `` in gross ignorance but perfect good faith , that the sooner the Irish recognized that before the arrival of
Cromwell	PERSON	they were utter savages , the better it would be for all concerned . ''

		It is to controvert such reckless statements as this that Dr.
Hyde	PERSON	has so effectively labored , and it is not suprising that the note of indignation escapes him now and then .

		We do not pretend to review this book , which is the first attempt at a consecutive treatment of the subject that has been made .

		We doubt if there is a Celtic scholar in
America	LOCATION	whose attempt to pass critical judgment upon it would not be an imperti - nence .

		But we record with pleasure this tribute to Dr.
Hyde	PERSON	's scholarship and to the attractiveness of his work , and we place the book among our stand - ard literary histories with the greatest satisfaction . ''

		Who 's Who '' has been for many Who ' Who an E n gii 8 tj reference book , tn
America	LOCATION	.

		J published annually , and of the great - est usefulness to editors and literary workers .

		The publishers of '' Who 's Who in
America	LOCATION	'' -LRB- A. N. Mar - quis
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- have taken the English work as a model , although not for slavish imitation , and have produced a volume that in the strictest sense supplies a long - felt want .

		It is a biographical dictionary of Americans now living , and distinguished for their achievements in literature , education , statesmanship , science , com - merce , or other fields of activity .

		The biographies give only the essential facts , and the form of state - ment is as condensed as possible .

		Since , in nearly all cases , the facts stated have been submitted for verification to the subjects concerned , the work is highly trustworthy .

		We hasten to add that the editor has been duly critical of the material offered him , and has strictly suppressed the efforts of self - seeking mediocrities to gain admission to its pages .

		He claims for his book '' the virtue of being honestly and conscientiously compiled , '' and , after a rather 102 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	r The new periodical deluxe .

		close examination , we see no reason to suspect the genuineness of the claim .

		The preface gives some amusing incidents concerning , on the one hand , the difficulties experienced in extracting information from some of the people approached , and , on the other , the sort of wire-pulling done by people who were not approached in order to attract attention to their unimportant selves .

		The exact number of biographies included is 8602 , which is rather more than one to ten thousand of our population .

		To the
State of New York 2039	ORGANIZATION	are credited , to
Massa	PERSON	- chusetts 742 , to the
District of Columbia	ORGANIZATION	724 , to
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	622 , and to
Illinois	LOCATION	564 .

		There is an interesting table of educational statistics , show - ing that 3237 are graduates of colleges , besides an odd thousand of graduates from professional schools .

		Another useful feature is a necrology of persons who have died since
January 1 , 1895	DATE	.

		Mr.
John W. Leonard	PERSON	is the editor of this work , which will be found indispensable by many classes of people .

		The first number of `` The
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon Review	ORGANIZATION	, '' Lady
Randolph Spencer Churchill	PERSON	's new periodical , has come to hand , and justifies all that has been promised for it from the artistic and mechanical points of view .

		The sumptuous binding in full morocco copies a cover made in
Paris	LOCATION	by some un - known artist of the late sixteenth century for King James I .

		The illustrations are reproductions of seven famous portraits , including
Stuart	PERSON	's Washing - ton ,
Reynolds	PERSON	's Georgians , Duchess of
Devonshire	ORGANIZATION	,
Rubens	PERSON	's
Anne	PERSON	of
Austria	LOCATION	, and Mr.
Onslow Ford	PERSON	's bust of Queen
Victoria	PERSON	.

		As for the literary con - tributors , it would take archangels to live up to all this magnificence of decoration and typography , and Mr.
Whitelaw Reid	PERSON	, for example , is not exactly an archangel .

		He discourses of '' Some Consequences of the Last Treaty of
Paris	LOCATION	. ''

		There are stories by Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	, Miss
Elizabeth Robins	PERSON	, and Mr.
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	, a three-act play by Mrs.
Craigie	PERSON	, a great poem by Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	, a masterly study of Peel by
Lord Rosebery	PERSON	, and many other interest - ing things .

		Altogether , the literary make-up of the number is highly creditable to the taste and sagac - ity of the editor .

		The volume is one of more than two hundred and fifty pages , and Mr.
John Lane	PERSON	is the American publisher .

		How to write a pastoral nowadays is a curious question .

		Pastorals , in the strict sense of the word , have been for some time lacking in our poetry .

		Herrick 's '' Hock-cart '' was one of the last genuine pastorals ;
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	and
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	seem , on different sides , a little wide of the line .

		What would a modern pas - toral be ?

		We suppose it must be realistic to a cer - tain degree : a generation which has known
Joseph Poorgrass	PERSON	and the other worthies of
Wessex	ORGANIZATION	is not likely to accept vague shepherds piping on banks of lilies or swains leading up the dance beneath the village tree .

		Then it must be romantic , too , with A modern pastoral .

		the romance of nature , with that feeling for the strangeness and mystery of the deep woods and open uplands that is one of the notes of the poetry of this century .

		Then probably it must be idealistic , in that each figure and character must be sur - charged with the feeling or atmosphere of some mood or tendency in thought ; for that is something we can not escape now .

		And it should also be classic : for the pastoral is a traditional form , it reminds us of the best periods of our literature , it is a form moulded by the touch of masters who are classic .

		All this perhaps one could say a priori .

		But we have not done so : we have run over these necessities only after reading Mr.
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	's '' Pan and the Young Shepherd '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- .

		It is a delightful book for this time of the year .

		We have mentioned some characteristics that it may amuse the reader to note .

		But it may well be that the reader will prefer to pay no heed to such matters , but rather to follow simply the half-real dream as he lies on some
summer	DATE	hillside that stretches itself out to the sun and the sea .

		If this be his feeling , we shall not quarrel with it .

		There are possibly golf-players in this country who will remember the opinion prevailing , say five or six years ago , concerning the proper sphere of woman in the golfing universe .

		Such readers will smile -LRB- or sigh -RRB- as they look at '' Our Lady of the Green : A Book about Ladies ' Golf . ''

		by
Louie Mackern	PERSON	and M. Boys -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- .

		We shall not presume to judge the precise value of this work to feminine readers .

		So far as playing the game is concerned , we are inclined to think that if any book be useful it will be some book without distinction of sex .

		There is but one game of golf , and men and women play it , or try to , in much the same way .

		There are , however , certain minor matters concerning which women may well have something to say to each other , and these points our authors wisely make their chief topics .

		The special necessities of ladies ' links , the delicacies incident to ladies ' clubs and club teams , some particular points of play , notes on clothes , and so on , these are matters which an ordinary golf-book rather neglects , and the chapters here devoted to them may well find interested readers .

		It must also be remarked that this is an English book , and that about two-thirds of it will be useful on this side the water chiefly for reference .

		The account of the Ladies '
Golf Union	ORGANIZATION	, the descriptions of ladies ' links and of good '' lady players , '' especially the directory of fifty ladies ' clubs , which last takes up almost half the book , these parts are hardly exciting over here .

		Still , even these matters , while they are not of great immediate interest to us , make the book a useful one for a club library .

		One chapter will perhaps be a subject of serious interest to some en - terprising Americans , namely , that which discusses the advantages of the -LRB- possible -RRB- profession of Lady Greenkeeper and Professional .

		THE DIAL 103 Stars and
Telescopes	ORGANIZATION	.

		Professor
Todd	PERSON	's '' Stars and
Tele	ORGANIZATION	- scopes '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is not a school text-book in astronomy -LRB- al - though it might be put to that use -RRB- , but rather a popular account of the subject for general reading .

		It is largely based upon Mr.
William T. Lynn	PERSON	's '' Celestial Motions , '' a book widely popular in En - gland , only a few of the chapters being Professor
Todd	PERSON	's own .

		The subject of '' The Cosmogony '' receives special treatment in a chapter mainly writ - ten by Dr. See .

		The leading features of this vol - ume are found in its wealth of illustration -LRB- the plates and cuts are literally numbered by hundreds -RRB- , its inclusion of the very latest results of research , its full account of existing observatories , and the space which it gives to the history of the science .

		Besides this , it succeeds in condensing an immense amount of information within reasonable limits , and without any sacrifice of clearness .

		Indeed , it is one of the most readable books upon astronomy that we have ever seen , being in this respect as attractive as the books of the late
R. A. Proctor	PERSON	.

		Making no demands upon the mathematical resources of its readers , the book is admirably calculated to interest the layman in its fascinating subject .

		The late
Irving Browne	PERSON	of
Buffalo	LOCATION	was known and beloved by book - collectors everywhere , and the sump - tuous volume containing his '' Ballads of a Book - Worm '' will not lack of readers . ''

		Unless you love books aside from their contents do not read this book at all , it is not meant for mere readers , '' says Mr.
Browne	PERSON	in his '' Foreword '' ; but we think there are few , whether collectors or not , who could fail to enjoy the genial humor and good-natured satire of these pleasant little '' thoughts , fancies , and adventures a-collecting . ''

		In the mechanical production of the volume Mr.
Hubbard	PERSON	and his associates of the Roycroft Press have surpassed even themselves .

		Paper , presswork , and binding are all of the best , and the large hand-colored ini - tial letters scattered throughout the book are beau - tifully executed .

		Altogether it is a volume to gladden the heart of the bibliophile , and one of which the Roycrofters may well be proud .

		A composite
Life of Gladstone	ORGANIZATION	.

		The two-volume '' Life of Gladstone '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , edited by Sir
Wemyss Reid	PERSON	, is put together on factory prin - ciples , each part of the finished product being the work of a special hand to whom was assigned the '' job '' he was thought best qualified to cope with .

		The political portion of the narrative is mainly from the pen of Mr.
F. W. Hirst	PERSON	, who contributes twelve out of the total of twenty chapters .

		Mr.
F. A. Robbins	PERSON	writes of Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	's ancestry and earlier years ; Mr.
Arthur J. Butler	PERSON	describes him as Scholar ,
Canon McColl	ORGANIZATION	as Theologian , the Rev.
W. Tuckwell	PERSON	as Critic , Sir
Henry W. Lucy	PERSON	as Orator , and so on .

		As a result of all this collab - oration and specialization the work gives an impres - sion of scrappiness , and it must be read in parts and passim to be enjoyed .

		But it is matterful and graphic , and its pictures are profuse and pleasantly miscellaneous .

		Meanwhile , the critical world looks expectantly to Mr.
John Morley	PERSON	, who will , we trust , in his forthcoming biographical venture , give us mainly biography proper , and not political and social philos - ophy with a slight leaven of biography , as his wont has been heretofore .

		THE SUCCESS OF A BOOK \ X 7 HEN it takes over a year to sell two thousand copies of a new novel by a popular author , the public and the publishers are apparently justified in thinking it a failure .

		If , however , it goes on selling steadily , if not largely , it evidently has some good qualities .

		When , then , at the end of three years , it has sold out four editions , a fifth is nearly exhausted , a sixth is in rapid preparation , and the sale is one thousand a month , the publisher is forced to believe that people like it .

		This is the case of THE JESSAMY BRIDE by
FRANKFORT MOORE	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is the story of
Oliver Goldsmith	PERSON	most lovable of men and the beautiful

twenty-five cents	MONEY	a copy , and three dollars for each yearly subscription .

		No Reduction in Size or Quality .

		FROM its first introduction to the American public
HARPER	PERSON	'S MAGAZINE has steadily grown in popular favor and appreciation .

		Received at first with spontaneous acclamation , it has for half a century retained its primacy in the house - hold regard and in the public esteem .

		In the largest sense it has been representa - tive of the best literature and of the best art of its time .

		With the
December	DATE	Number it will enter upon its hundredth volume in circumstances so auspicious as to give it an exceptional advantage .

		In its fifty years of existence it has wit - nessed many changes in the arts of illustrating and printing , and it has ever been a pioneer in adopting every new contrivance for beautifying its pages .

		During all these years improvements in machinery and processes have been such as to reduce the cost of manufacture to the point where the publishers are at length enabled to make a corresponding reduction to their readers , and while the price hereafter will be only
twenty-five cents	MONEY	a copy , they take this opportunity to announce not only that the character of the MAGAZINE will be maintained at its present high standard , but also that every effort will be made to make it more attractive .

		IMPORTANT NEW FICTION .

		READY SHORTLY .

		ANTHONY HOPE 'S NEW NOVEL , THE KING 'S MIRROR .

		MR. HOPE 'S new romance pictures the life of a prince and king under conditions modern , and yet shared by representatives of royalty almost throughout history .

		The inter - actions of the people and royalty , the aspirations of the prince , the intrigues surrounding him , the cares of state , and the craving for love , are some of the motives developed , with the accompaniments of incident and adventure , wherein the author proves his mastery of sus - pended interest and dramatic effect .

		In the subtle development of character nothing that this brilliant author has written is shrewder than this vivid picture of a king 's inner life .

		It is a romance which will not only absorb the attention of readers , but impress them with a new admiration for the author 's power .

		The novel is aptly and effectively illustrated by Mr.
Frank T. Merrill	PERSON	.

		AVERAGES .

		By
ELEANOR STUART	PERSON	, Author of '' Stone Pastures . ''

		NOVELS of
New York	LOCATION	have sometimes failed through lack of knowledge of the theme , but the brilliant author of '' Averages '' and '' Stone Pastures '' has had every oppor - tunity to know her
New York	LOCATION	well .

		She has been able , therefore , to avoid the extremes of `` high life '' and '' low life , '' which have seemed to many to constitute the only salient phases of
New York	LOCATION	, and she paints men and women of every day , and sketches the curious inter - dependence and association or impingement of differing circles in
New York	LOCATION	.

		There is a suggestion of the adventurer , a figure not unfamiliar to
New Yorkers	LOCATION	, and there are glimpses of professional life , and the existence of idlers . ''

		Averages '' is not a story of froth or slums , but a brilliant study of actualities , and its publication will attract increased attention to the rare talent of the author .

		135 GOETHE IN
STRASSBURG	LOCATION	.

		Goethe reached
StraSsburg	LOCATION	on the second of
April , 1770	DATE	, being twenty years and seven months old .

		He remained there until
August	DATE	of the fol - lowing year , or until he had reached the age of twenty-two .

		If , as
Uhland	LOCATION	maintains , the Minster rustled all its stony foliage as young Goethe was carving his name into its tower , then may the ven - erable city itself well have felt a thrill throughout its foundations at the moment when the splendid youth first stepped down from the
Frankfort	LOCATION	post - coach in front of the '' Spirit Inn . ''

		The three years of university life in
Leipzig	LOCATION	had been in many re - spects a disappointment to the young student , still more so to his ambitious father .

		It will not do to exalt one ideal of culture by depreciating the best which has been developed elsewhere : it was no wonder that , in the middle of the eighteenth cen - tury , the proud splendors of the French power and intellect arrested the wondering attention of `` Vet - ter
Michel	PERSON	, '' just rubbing his eyes and coming to the consciousness of his own possibilities .


Paris	LOCATION	was recognized as the centre of the world 's elegance and civilization , and these things are not so cheap or powerless that they can be lightly reckoned with .

		If
Esau	PERSON	, by association with his '' smooth '' brother , can subdue something of his own redness and hair - iness , it will not be to his disadvantage : but let him give good heed to it that he do not at the same time part with his peculiar birthright for a mess of pot - tage .

		Our accusation against
Leipzig	LOCATION	, the ''
Paris	LOCATION	in miniature '' that '' refined its people , '' is that it subsist - ed entirely on borrowed culture : elegance , gallantry , and fine taste were its law and gospel , and this code was enforced by the dictation of an unusually close corporation of organized social influences .

		The youth from
Frankfort	LOCATION	, who had by no means come from a milieu which represented the ultra - exclusive set even in that somewhat patriarchal city , was imposed upon and brought into subjection by this affected , precious , superficially-clever , heart - suppressing , conventional aristocracy : his
Pegasus	ORGANIZATION	, docked and groomed , in a gilded harness and with the tightest of check-reins , minced along before a stylish barouche , instead of soaring with mighty wing over the tops of all mountains .

		On returning to
Frankfort	LOCATION	, he finds that very German place a rude , cheerless den of Philistinism , and it is in hope of going farther under the tutelage of the '' grand nation '' that he betakes himself to the French city ,
Strassburg	LOCATION	, to complete his studies .

		He makes a goodly sight as he steps down from the post-coach lately mentioned .


Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	remarks 114 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, that he never saw any man who seemed worthy to inspire love , no , nor read of any , except
Leonardo da Vinci	PERSON	, and perhaps Goethe in his youth .

		The year and a half of imprisonment in the sick-room is over : his powers are equal to what is to be de - mantled of them ; he brings once more ebullient youthful spirits , joy , courage , and the fire of life , a wealth of sensibility and responsiveness to all j esthetic influences .

		He is ready to win immediate confidence , and is of a nature which goes out to others and delights to make friend * .

		Moreover , he has all the prepossession which derives from a beau - tiful person , elegance of fashion , and an abundance of money .

		Under the influence of the '' beautiful spirit , ''
Fraulein von Klettenberg	PERSON	, there has lately occurred an awakening of the religious nature , and be holds that earnest theory of life which gives it dignity and meaning .

		A discovery which the young man soon makes is , that
Strassburg	LOCATION	, upon nominally French soil , is far more German than had been
Leipzig	LOCATION	, in the very heart of
Germany	LOCATION	.

		The result of his life here is the opening of his eyes to what the spirit of bis own people is , and his being forever saved for that spirit , to become its embodiment and its prophet .

		The intellectually-ambitious group of men at his boarding - house is German , using his native tongue .

		As was natural enough , these striving young spirits made themselves acquainted with the superb achieve - ments of the French mind , and received therefrom a quickening of power and an expanded ideal , but they were too earnest , genuine , and hearty to be bound over to the worship of passing idols .

		It was in
Strassburg	LOCATION	that
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's heart re - sponded to the mighty charm of the natural beauty of his own country , an element in the German tem - perament which has been of priceless poetic value , and one which we , in our great and beautiful and rich land , for the most part have either failed to develope , or have tamely allowed ourselves to be robbed of .

		Industrialism , the selfishness of capital , which rushes by the shortest way to get the largest immediate money-returns without waiting until the natural right of the people to beauty in their daily surroundings has been made sure , builds its ugly fac - tories , disfigures our cities with tasteless buildings , uncared-for streets , telegraph-poles , grim skeletons of bridges and elevated roads , cuts up our landscape with hideous fences , and seizes upon natural points of picturesque vantage which should be forever held by the people and for the people , as they are in Ger - many !

		The man among us who puts up unsightly houses and unpainted sheds is neither molested by law nor visited by lynching-parties , whereas in
Germany	LOCATION	there would be as universal a riot in such a case as if a well-known brewery should attempt to adulterate a favorite beer .

		The German landscape -LRB- for such it must be called -RRB- of
Alsace	LOCATION	disclosed itself with magic beauty to
Goethe	PERSON	upon his very arrival , for almost the first thing which he did was to climb to the top of the cathedral and gain a view of the panorama which lay spread before him .

		He never wearied of celebrating the praises of the beauty of
Alsace	LOCATION	, its rocks and hills , its forests and fields , rivers , meadows , and towns .

		From Goethe in
Strassburg	LOCATION	we date that masterly treatment of Na - ture in literature , at the same time sentimental and realistic , which came as an enlivening power into German letters , and to which we owe no little of the imperishable charm of '' Werther '' and a thou - sand secondary streams which flowed from that refreshing source .

		As medieval
Strassburg	LOCATION	had itself been one of the greatest achievements of German national spirit and character , so was its cathedral a mighty work of Gothic architecture , an expression of the vigor of the German soul which had long waited the voice which should tell abroad its power and meaning .

		In Goethe the voice was found to herald forth this truth in joyous polemic .

		In
Leipzig	LOCATION	, under the influence of the pseudo-Grecian French classicism , the term `` Gothic '' had meant to him -LRB- as to other people who made a conscience of being strictly `` correct '' and contemporary in matters of taste -RRB- the sum-total of all that was chaotic , inorganic , un - natural , over-loaded , and patched-together ; signifi - cantly , however , the object to which he eagerly turned his first footsteps was this great monument , and it made the complete conquest of his great spirit ; from the moment of this visit , he was its victim , its devotee , and in silence and apart he gave himself up to it , immersed himself in it , until it began like every majestic work of art , and upon the only conditions under which anything superla - tively great and good ever yields up its riddle to gradually whisper to him who had so reverently surrendered himself to it the secret of its spell .

		With the awakening of the native German spirit within him , he began to look upon this cathedral as an organic outgrowth of the German soul , and to recognize its significance in that great lesson for his age and his people : ''
Ans Vaterland	LOCATION	, ana teure , schlieas dich an .

		Das halte feat niit deinem ganzen
Herzen !	ORGANIZATION

		Hier Bind die starken Wurzeln deiner
Kraft	PERSON	. '' ''

		Our age , '' he cries out in his tribute to the noble building , has surrendered its own heritage , it has sent its sons abroad to gather foreign products to their own destruction .

		Our native genius must not consent to soar aloft on any borrowed wings even though they were the very wings of the morning ! ''

		This new consciousness , which dared to assert the right-to-be of an architecture not appropriated bod - ily from ancient
Greece	LOCATION	, has in our own century brought to conclusion the Cathedral of
Cologne	LOCATION	and the Minster of Ulrn , and rescued them , in full beauty and honor , to be a joy to ages yet to come .

		Our young student by no means adopts that hedonistic theory of life which makes beer ami skittles '' the object of existence : he has an almost unnatural appreciation of the unique formative value of this period for his whole future .

		As he writes , ' The years at the university by right demand the concentrated exercise of all of one 's intellectual
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 115 powers .

		It is the time , the good or careless use of which we continue to feel throughout life . ''

		Emer - son , in '' Representative Men , '' sums up
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's aim as Culture : not what a man can accomplish , but what can be accomplished in him .

		This earnest and untiring striving '' in virum perfectum '' is the note of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's entire student-lite in
Strassburg	LOCATION	.

		He recognizes that the student must not lay claim to be , but must be content to become ; that when he ven - tures to look with complacency upon any complete attainment , that very hour he ceases to be a true student .

		The group to which he belongs is domi - nated by a passion for right critical judgment , and for an understanding of the reasons which underlie it ; ' and yet he perceives that the attempt to make a final analysis of aesthetic sensations is an elusive quest . ''

		Beauty is , once for all , inexplicable : it is a wavering , glittering vision , whose contour can be fixed by no definition ; the case is like catching butterflies : the poor creature flutters in the net and rubs off its most beautiful colors ; even if we can capture it uninjured , we keep it as something stiff and lifeless the dead body is not the entire crea - ture , something is missing , an important something , and , in this instance , as in all similar ones , a very superlatively important thing : the life , the spirit which animates the whole . ''

		Pretty sound aesthetics this , in a familiar letter of a student who is not twenty-one years old !

		Along with theory goes prac - tice in writing , which brings his best resources into play , and which developes , even here , a sound , clear , and full-flowing style .

		How catholic and mature the tastes , how full the acquisitions , which ` he has brought with him , can only be indicated .

		In
Leip	PERSON	- zig and
Frankfort	LOCATION	he had already taken on a stately freight of information in the fields of philosophy and theology , jurisprudence and political economy , medicine and natural sciences , history and antiqui - ties , art and poetry .

		His eager mind lays hold of everything which interests the human spirit .

		There were the ancient classics , works on art , law-studies taken up vigorously ; German history and antiqui - ties , German authors , from Luther down ; studies of the
Strassburg	LOCATION	dialect and the folk-songs of
Alsace	LOCATION	; natural history , electricity , travel , and medicine ; the young man also elected some serious courses in chemistry and anatomy .

		In English there were
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Goldsmith	PERSON	, and Smollet ,
Percy	PERSON	's Re - liques ,
Ossian	PERSON	and ancient Scottish ballads ; in French , an energetic and penetrating study of the poets and thinkers , and as was natural in
Strassburg	LOCATION	an attempt at the practical mastery of the language itself , in which -LRB- in spite of the most favorable con - ditions -RRB- Goethe himself concludes to be content with a relative perfection .

		Goethe 's practical achieve - ments in English , which he had pursued from youth up , and to which he had especially applied himself in the
Leipzig	LOCATION	days , have left some monuments be - hind them .

		Some comfort may be derived by those who are struggling with an alien idiom in reading his English letters to his sister during this period . ''

		The father ... would see if I write as good en - glish as
Lupton	PERSON	german ...
Lupton	PERSON	is a good fellow , a marry , invetious fellow as I see it in his letter , which is wroten whit a spirit of jest , much laudably moderated by the respect , he owes to his master .

		But one can see , that he is no yet acquainted , with the fair and delicate manners of our language ... Think on it sister thou art a happy maiden , to have a brother who makes english veses .

		I pray thee be not haugty thereof . ''

		A SONG OVER THE UNCONFIDENCE TOWARDS MY SELF . ''

		Thou knowest how heappily they Freind Walks upon florid Ways ; Thou knowst how heavens bounteous hand Leads him to golden days . ''

		But hah !

		a cruel ennemy Destroies all that Bless ; In Moments of Melancholy Flies all my Heappiness ... '' But when they then my prayer not hear I break my wispring lire ; Then from my eyes runns down a tear , Extinguish th ' incensed fire . ''

		Then curse
I. Freind	PERSON	, the fated sky , And from th ' altar I fly ; And to my Freinds aloud I cry Be happier then I. ... '' Truely , my english knowledge is very little , but i 'll gather all my forces , to perfection it .

		Visiting my let - ters , ye shall have found many faults , ye may pardon . ''

		Further , we have this gallant defence of a maiden who has made an undesirable match : '' But sister , let us dam no man .

		I 've courage enough to take her party .

		Think her education sister , and then dam her if thou darest .

		A maiden , of no great natural genius , she lives her first Years in the company of her parents and sisters .

		They are all homiest men , but how form a womens heart to his heapyness they understand not . ''

		The psychological truth here is perhaps more to be admired than the form in which it is put .

		The hundred varied interests , all so keenly pur - sued , split up the days , to be sure , but as
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	said , '' One has always time enough when one wishes to employ it well , '' and he accomplished roundly whatever he undertook .

		There is no priggishness or arid self-consciousness in all this striving : he has a fresh sympathy which causes other young men to seek his advice , a pretty good test .

		He warns such a friend against idealizing him , and , with all that he has done and learned , he counts himself far from wise enough to give counsel , in both respects offering suggestions for our own generation of stu - dents , among whom a talented and moderately - equipped young head has often the manner of know - ing more about everything than any one person can possibly know about anything .

		Who shall do justice to that simple love-story of Sesenheim , in its happy , peaceful rural setting , an idyl imperishable in its power to make us forget '' The fardel coarse of customary life 's Exceeding injucundity . ''

		Friederike is one of those dear maidens who are forever surrounded by a refreshing ether , a hover - 116 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, ing minister of joy to others , full of capable help - fulness , worthy of all respect and love , combining in rare balance those happy extremes of gaiety and discretion , prudence and light-hearted ness , naivete and self-consciousness .

		She is an '' out-of-doors '' girl , seen at her beat when running like a light - footed deer over a rustic path , vying in graceful charm with the flowering fields , and in indestructi - ble cheerfulness with the blue sky above her little blonde head , '' And round her happy fooUtep * blow The authentic ain of ParadiM . ''

		The love came naturally and truly , '' as though in sport . ''

		Five days after their meeting we have the young man 's first letter , which reveals to us that two hearts have found and understood each other .

		It is a love that makes him thrice a man , '' in
Tennyson	LOCATION	's phrase , that heightened his powers of creation and expression , which had been starved and frozen in superfine society : in ''
Kleine Blunaen	PERSON	, kleine
Blatter	PERSON	'' is reached the crowning glory of all lighter German lyrics -LRB- thus
Erich Schmidt	PERSON	, princeps literatorum -RRB- .

		We do not excuse the young man 's though tleasness in not having fully reasoned out the result , while allowing himself to gravitate easily and deeply into the relation of accepted son-in-law ; if it was really due to the integrity of his great life - plan that he should not be permanently hampered by a nature as limited in certain directions as waa hers -LRB- though some later facts cast a grim light on this theory -RRB- , he should have had courage to rend sooner the flowery fetters which were binding two lives closer and closer .

		In
Strassburg	LOCATION	, then ,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	found the true canon of poetry , '' Look in thy heart , and write '' ; he escaped from conceits and conventionalities to life , and to the faith that poetry is the necessary outlet for the pressure of deep , powerful emotions .

		Nor will we by any means reckon it the least important gain of the student-days in
Strassburg	LOCATION	that it was there that the youth , with all his gaiety , came under the tonic influence of
Herder	ORGANIZATION	, the man who had fought his way , with baffled blows , on a bitter field of adversity , and had learned the reali - ties of life , and how to estimate them comparatively .

		Irritable and censorious , he never approved or was satisfied with
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's work , and the greatness with which the cheerful student submitted to this trench - ant dogmatism is not to be unnoticed as a mark of his magnanimity .

		Herder taught him the popular nature of true poetry , that it is the necessary pro- duct of the inner consciousness of a nation or a race ; he disclosed to him the poverty of German literature , caused
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	even to doubt his own powers , and led him to the deep well of the Hebrew poets , to Odsian , and above all to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		As
Keats	PERSON	, on first looking into
Chapman	PERSON	's Homer , felt '' like some watcher of the ikies When a new planet iwims into hi ken , '' so our young poet , under the magisterial guidance of
Herder	ORGANIZATION	, experienced with a wonderful power that by Shakespeare his being had been infinitely wid - ened , that all things had become new and strange . '

		The first page which I read made me his captive forever ; and when I had finished one work of his , I stood like a man born blind , whose sight had been restored by a miracle . ''

		To Shakespeare he sur - rendered himself unconditionally , even as he had already capitulated to the cathedral .

		From this
Strassburg	LOCATION	stage , equipped with the resources which it has brought , our young hero goes forth to create , one after another , those noble works of art which have become the priceless treasure of humanity .

		It is one of the sacred trusts committed to each generation , that it shall preserve these works in their freshness and perfection , and transmit them , unimpaired , to the ages which are to come .

		THE RIGHT BOOKS FOR CHILDREN .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In the matter of selecting the right books for our children , we still have to '' educate our educators , '' and your recent article on the subject , Mr.
Walter Taylor Field	PERSON	's letter in your issue of
August 1	DATE	, together with many other important utterances of men and women of authority , which have been put forth during the past few years , all tend to show a steady growth of a wiser and healthier public opinion .

		We can reach our little ones only through the home and through the school , and I believe that the old - fashioned reading books , full of orts and scraps of lit - erature , thrown together with no intelligent grouping or with no plan of correlation , have had much to do with the begetting of the craving for the '' tidbit '' class of reading which is so much to be deplored .

		Newspapers and magazines have long fostered and encouraged this taste .

		An important duty devolving upon those who pro- vide and select reading for the young is that of encour - aging more concentration and less desultoriness ; and we shall secure the concentrated attention of the chil - dren if we give them the right books .

		The world 's literature is full of pleasure-books which stimulate and uplift while they delight , books which the children can enjoy without taking barm .

		`` There is a land of pure delight , where books immortal reign , '' and it is to this land that we would guide the willing feet of our little ones .

		These views are recognized by all our ad - vanced educational authorities , and there is a growing tendency to give children books in their entirety , instead of bits from books , or editions of classic works in which everything but the movement and incident have been eliminated .

		No book has suffered more from this treatment than ''
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	, '' and of the countless editions on the market there are scarcely any complete ones issued at a popular price .

		When I read ''
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	'' as a boy at school , in an edition denuded of everything but the doings of the hero , I wondered in a boyish way how he must have felt at being thus alone on a desert island .

		I imagined his fears and his terrors , and when
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 117 in later years I read the book in its completed form I found that its author had made it not only a book of exciting action , but full of psychological interest , scarcely any of which would be beyond the understand - ing of the young reader , because it is the logical out - come of the situation in which
Robinson Crusoe	ORGANIZATION	found himself .

		Books should be as carefully selected for children as the food they eat , and young people should not be allowed to browse among books that have not been se - lected for them , to range free over every field and pas - ture .

		They may have an instinct of food which more cultivated palates lose ; but it is an error to suppose that evil will always fall off their minds like water from a duck 's back .

		If they are not harmed by what they do not understand , and if they often assimilate what is of use to them , and what no one would ever have dreamed of suggesting to them , it is difficult for any of us to say exactly when the understanding of harm does begin , and it is better to keep children alto - gether away from the possibility of it in their reading . ''

		Art is noble , but the sanctity of a human soul is nobler still , '' and it is impossible to say at what stage the passions cease to be silent , and tastes have been formed .

		Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	says : '' I would put a child into a library where no unfit books are , and let him read at his choice .

		A child should not be discouraged from reading any - thing which he takes a liking to , because it is above his reach .

		If this is the case , the child will soon find out and desist ; if not , he of course gains the instruction , which is so much the more likely to come from the inclination with which he takes up the study . ''

		All very good and true ; but books are good for boys and girls only as they are ready for them .

		It often happens that when a child has taken up a book that has failed to interest him , it has left a memory behind which has prevented him from looking into it when he has come across it again in later life .

		If he had found the book when he was ready for it , it would have fallen on good ground and brought forth fruit .

		So we should provide groups of books for children to select from , not seeking books which we think a child ought to be ready for at a certain stage of his development , and force them upon him , but we should let him have a wide range , within certain very broad limits ; and in making the selection it may be generally said that the prime requi - sites in the reading to be provided for the child are , that it should be interesting , wholesome , true , and good literature .

		With these criteria in mind , the task should not be so difficult as it may at first sight appear .

		While I am generally in sympathy with all that Mr.
Walter Taylor Field	PERSON	says in the letter to which I have referred above , I think that he is a little hard on `` Jack the Giant-Killer . ''

		I would not feed children on tales of ogres and giants who eat up little boys , nor encour - age the reading of the boy bandit and Wild West stories of the news stand ; but we can not shut our eyes to the fact that boys must have their fights with the Indians , their adventures by sea and land , their hair - breadth escapes by flood and field , in their reading .

		The love of fight is biological and self-preservative .

		We can not eradicate it if we would , and we would not erad - icate it if we could .

		There is plenty of it , however , , in the classic works ' of our great authors , without going to the dime novel to find it .

		THADDETJS
STEVENS	PERSON	.

		* The
Life of Tbaddeus Stevens	ORGANIZATION	fitly takes its rank in the '' American Statesmen '' series , and will be welcomed by a large constituency of appreciative readers .

		He was the son of
Joshua	PERSON	and
Sally Stevens	PERSON	, and was born on the
4th of April , 1792	DATE	, in
Danville	LOCATION	,
Vermont	LOCATION	, where the principal peaks of the White and
Franconia Mountains	LOCATION	and the
Green Mountains	ORGANIZATION	are vis - ible .

		Of his ancestry but little is known , but they were of Anglo-Saxon stock .

		His father was desperately poor , and wanting in enterprise and thrift ; but according to all accounts his mother was a woman of remarkable character and strength of mind .

		Thaddeus was a sickly child , and as he could not work on the farm his mother sent him to
Dartmouth College	ORGANIZATION	, in which he graduated at the age of twenty-two .

		Mr.
McCall	PERSON	gives the chief incidents in the pioneer life of
Stevens	PERSON	, and the story recalls the kindred experience of many famous Amer - icans who have fought their way through pov - erty and hardship to distinction and usefulness .

		We can not dwell upon details .

		He chose the law as his profession , and finally located in
Gettysburg	LOCATION	,
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, where his brilliant success in the management of a remarkable murder case at once made him locally famous .

		In
1842	DATE	he removed to
Lancaster	LOCATION	, where he immediately took high rank as a lawyer .

		In the early days of his practice he took no part in politics .

		The Federal party , to which he had been attached , had passed away .

		The party headed by
Jackson	PERSON	had no charm for him .

		When the abduction and murder of Morgan created the Anti-Masonic party , he became one of its leaders .

		The movement disappointed him , however , and he identified himself with the Whig party , which was then coming to the front .

		He took the stump for
Harrison	PERSON	in
1840	DATE	, and for
Clay	ORGANIZATION	in
1844	DATE	.

		In the meantime he had distinguished himself in the convention which met in
1837	DATE	to amend the constitution of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, boldly avowing the radical anti- slavery opinions of his later life .

		In the leg - islature of
1834	DATE	he had espoused the policy of free public schools , which aroused a perfect tempest of opposition throughout the State ; but by the phenomenal power of a single great speech he turned the tables upon his opponents , *

		118 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, made himself the idol of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, and won a victory which he regarded as the greatest achievement of his life .

		His service in the state legislature extending through a series of years , was distinguished by rare courage and inde - pendence , by great ability in debate , and by a ready wit which he always employed with un - erring effect .

		His reputation , however , was bounded by
State	ORGANIZATION	lines until his first election to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	in
1849	DATE	, when fifty-eight years of age .

		The way was now opened for his leader - ship in a wider field .

		The acquisition of for - eign territory had made slavery the overshadow - ing question , and the seriousness of the crisis was unprecedented .

		Probably no
Congress	ORGANIZATION	since the formation of the government had con - tained more eminent men .


Stevens	PERSON	was a new member , though well advanced in years .

		He was in no haste to assert himself , and when urged to do so said , '' I will tarry at
Jericho	LOCATION	till my beard grows . ''

		He did not dream of the fame which awaited him as a great party leader .

		The slave power was then in the ascendant , and of course would handicap such a man in the organization of the committees ; but it could not silence him .

		His training as a lawyer and his extended experience in the
State	ORGANIZATION	legislature had prepared him for his task .


Stevens	PERSON	was an anti-slavery Whig , and the nine Free Soil members of the
House	ORGANIZATION	held the balance of power between the old parties , and voted for him for Speaker .

		Cobb of
Georgia	LOCATION	was finally elected .


Stevens	PERSON	hated slavery with an in - tensity which would be difficult to characterize .

		It was a passion , as seen in the several speeches made in this
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, which com - pare favorably with the best literature of the anti-slavery crusade .

		He voted and spoke against all the compromise measures of
1850	DATE	, and rebuked the servility of both
Webster	PERSON	and Clay .

		He was a member of the
House	ORGANIZATION	in the Thirty-second
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, but the Anti-slavery agitation had greatly subsided , and his prin - cipal speech was devoted to the tariff .

		In
1859	DATE	he reappeared in the Thirty-sixth
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, in which he distinguished himself by his masterly leadership of the minority which resisted the cowardly tactics of the famous
Committee of Thirty-three	ORGANIZATION	.

		Buf the great fact in the life of
Stevens	PERSON	was his matchless leadership in dealing with the question of Reconstruction .

		That question involved the whole problem of the Civil War .


Stevens	PERSON	so understood it , and in the very be - ginning of the war he sounded the cry of dan - ger .

		The plan of Reconstruction proposed by
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	, on the 8th of
December , 1863	DATE	, and known as the Presidential plan , under which
Louisiana	LOCATION	proceeded to establish a State gov - ernment , provided for no guardianship of the
United States	LOCATION	over the organization of
State	ORGANIZATION	governments , no law to prescribe who should vote , no civil functionaries to see that the law was faithfully executed , no supervising author - ity to control the election .

		President
Johnson	PERSON	's
North Carolina	LOCATION	order was exactly one in theory with
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's
Louisiana	LOCATION	plan .

		It appointed a governor of
North Carolina	LOCATION	, and ordered him at the earliest practicable time to prescribe rules for convening a convention composed of dele - gates chosen by the loyal people of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, the '' loyal people '' to include only those who should take the oath and receive the pardon provided for in the amnesty proclamation ; and they must be qualified voters according to the laws in force at the time of secession .

		Thus the work of Reconstruction was placed in the hands of the white race , and in effect was put in the control of those who had participated in the Re - bellion .

		Since the latter were greatly in the majority , the formation of the new Constitu - tion which was to establish the conditions of the suffrage and other fundamental rights was to be committed to their hands .

		In all these proceedings
Congress	ORGANIZATION	had no voice .

		Recon - struction was dealt with as the exclusive prov - ince of the Executive , and was to be initiated in all the
States	LOCATION	whenever demanded by one - tenth as many votes as were cast in that
State	ORGANIZATION	for President in
1860	DATE	.


Stevens	PERSON	had no patience with such hasty and slipshod legislation , which so plainly opened the way for the return of the rebels to power and the surrender of all that the war had established .

		The scheme of Reconstruction known as the Congressional plan , supported in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	by
Wade	PERSON	and in the
House	ORGANIZATION	by
Winter Davis	ORGANIZATION	, pro- vided that the President should appoint a pro- visional governor in each of the States in Re - bellion , and that so soon as resistance to the national authority had ceased in any State the governor should enroll the white male citizens , and if a majority of them should take an oath to support the Constitution of the
United States	LOCATION	, then the election of delegates to a con - stitutional convention should be ordered .

		The
State	ORGANIZATION	constitution should contain certain pro- visions , and when these had been complied with to the satisfaction of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	the President should recognize the
State	ORGANIZATION	government , and the
State	ORGANIZATION	should thereupon be entitled to repre - sentation in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		Although the bill em -
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 119 bodying this plan was more stringent in its provisions than
Lincoln	LOCATION	's plan ,
Stevens	PERSON	would not accept it .

		He declared that it partially acknowledged the rebel States to have rights under the constitution , which he denied , insist - ing that war had abrogated them all .

		In this particular the supporters of the Congressional Plan agreed with the Democrats , who talked about '' an indissoluble union of indestructible States '' and opposed any sort of Reconstruc - tion .

		All that was necessary was for each of the seceded States to resume its place in the
Union	ORGANIZATION	under the Constitution and laws of such State at the close of the conflict .

		It is true that if the Rebellion had been nipped in the bud , or had been abandoned be - fore it assumed its gigantic proportions , no reconstruction of the government would have been necessary .

		But when the conflict ceased to be any longer a mere insurrection against the national authority , and took upon itself the character of a war with a foreign power , as
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	of the
United States	LOCATION	decided , the insurgents became public enemies , and when conquered were the conquered enemies of the
United States	LOCATION	and subject to the power of the conqueror , according to the laws of war appli - cable to such a conflict .

		The nation had a per - fect right to prescribe just such conditions as it saw fit , looking to indemnity for the past and security for the future .

		To argue that the men who carried on this work of devastation for four years in the name of
State Rights	ORGANIZATION	should be allowed at the end of the conflict to set up
State Rights	ORGANIZATION	as a bar to their accountability and a reason for their unconditional restoration to power , was a mockery of justice and an insult to common sense .

		As citizens of the
United States	LOCATION	, they could no more escape their obliga - tions than they could run away from their own shadows .

		Through their treason and rebellion they lost their rights under the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, but
the Union	ORGANIZATION	lost none of its rights over them .

		Stevens so understood matters as early as the session of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	beginning in
December , 1861	DATE	, and in every speech which he made on the subject he reiterated his views , which were far more rad - ical than those of his party , but which the party finally adopted , in substance .

		In opening the debate on Reconstruction ,
December 18 , 1865	DATE	, he attacked the position of both Lincoln and
Johnson	PERSON	, which assumed that Reconstruction was within the province of the Executive .

		His argument was a Constitutional one , and after expounding his well-known views on this ques - tion he said that the Rebel States should not be admitted to the
Union	ORGANIZATION	until the principles embodied in his proposed amendments to the Constitution should be established in that in - strument , and especially the amendment basing representation upon the number of legal voters .

		If they should be admitted with the basis un - changed , they would , with the aid of Northern Democrats , '' at the very first election take pos - session of the
White House	ORGANIZATION	and the halls of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		They might assume the Confed - erate debt , repudiate the Union debt , and re - establish slavery .

		He proposed to take no such chances while the North was the conqueror , and boldly proposed negro suffrage , declaring the doctrine that this was a '' white man 's govern - ment '' to be '' as atrocious as the infamous sentiment that damned the late chief justice to everlasting fame , and I fear to everlasting fire . ''

		On the
30th of April , 1866	DATE	,
Stevens	PERSON	reported to the
House	ORGANIZATION	the important Fourteenth Amend - ment , for submission to the States ; and with a few changes in form it ultimately became a part of the Constitution .

		The report of the
Committee on Reconstruction	ORGANIZATION	, although largely the work of
Stevens	PERSON	, did not go so far as he had desired , and on the last day of the session he offered amendments giving the blacks an equal right of suffrage with the white race , and supported these amendments in a speech which was one of the most impressive ever delivered in the
National House of Representatives	ORGANIZATION	.

		He was at the time worn out with the work of the session , his health was slender , he bore the burden of more than the allotted number of years , and very probably the fear that he might not be permitted to return to his seat in the
House	ORGANIZATION	imparted an unusual solemnity to his manner and inspired him to '' make one more perhaps an expiring effort to do some - thing which shall be useful to my fellowmen ; something to elevate and enlighten the poor , the oppressed , and the ignorant in this great crisis of human affairs . ''

		He declared that the black man must have the ballot or he would continue to be a slave .

		There was some alle - viation to the lot of a bondsman , but '' a free - man deprived of every human right is the most degraded of human beings . '' ''

		I know it is easy to protect the interests of the rich and powerful ; but it is a great labor to guard the rights of the poor and down-trodden it is the eternal labor of Sisyphus forever to be renewed .

		In this , perhaps my final action on this great question , I can see noth - ing in my political course , especially in regard to hu - man freedom , which I could wish to have expurgated or changed .

		I believe that we must all account hereafter for deeds done in the body , and that political deeds will 120 TIIK DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, be among those account * .

		I desire to take to the bar of that final , settlement the record which I shall this day make on the great question of human rights .

		While I am sure it will not make atonement for half my errors , I hope it will be some palliation .

		Are there any who will venture to take the list with their negative seal upon it , and will dare to unroll it before that stern Judge who is the Father of the immortal beings whom they have been trampling under foot , and whose souls they have been crushing out ? ''

		As has been stated , the plan of Reconstruc - tion which was finally adopted conformed very closely to the ideas that
Stevens	PERSON	had long and persistently advocated .

		It was promulgated by
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and not by the Executive , as he had never ceased to contend should be the case .

		It applied a radical dogma , which he had long proclaimed with the voice of one crying in the wilderness , and practically treated the
Southern States	LOCATION	as conquered provinces and as entitled to no rights under the Constitution .

		It pre - scribed universal suffrage for the black as well as for the white man , not merely in the forma - tion of the new State constitutions , but as an enduring part of those instruments .

		All this Mr.
McCall	PERSON	well sets forth , with more of detail than is possible in a review like this ; and he concludes the subject by pointing out that the wisdom which passes judgment upon a situa - tion a third of a century afterwards has an ob - vious advantage over the wisdom which has to deal with it at the time . ''

		We of to-day also lose sight of many of the diffi - culties with which the problem was surrounded , and which have disappeared in the distance .

		The choice which
Stevens	PERSON	and the statesmen associated with him were compelled to make did not lie between the course actu - ally adopted and an ideal condition of things .

		In the light in which they acted , they were compelled to deal with as grave a national situation as ever existed .

		It was beyond the power of any surgery at once to deliver society , well and whole , from the condition in which its errors and crimes had placed it . ''

		The chapter devoted to
Stevens	PERSON	's personal characteristics , particularly his wit and humor , is exceedingly readable .

		Those who knew him will recall other examples as good as those here given , for his humor was unfailing ; but his own personality was so large a part of what he said that the point must be somewhat dulled in the telling .


Stevens	PERSON	passed away on
August 11 , 1868	DATE	, and his body was buried , according to his ex - pressed wish , in a small cemetery where black as well as white were admitted , thus illustrat - ing in death the principles which he had advo - cated through a long life , the equality of man before his Creator .

		He was preeminently a democrat , the friend of the poor and oppressed , and his biographer well says that privilege never had a more powerful nor a more con - sistent foe .

		HISTORY OF THE ENGLISH DRAMA .

		* A new edition of Dr.
A. W. Ward	PERSON	's may - num .

		opus , '' A History of English Dramatic Literature , '' is particularly welcome , for several reasons .

		In the first place , the work is beyond all compare the most exhaustive and important in our tongue in its field .

		And secondly , un - like most new editions -LRB- which are more prop - erly described as '' impressions , '' being simply reprints of the same matter -RRB- , this present issue contains so much in the way of rectification , improved arrangement , re-phrasing , and en - largement , that it might almost be called a new work upon the lines of the original study of a quarter of a century ago .

		The earlier intro - duction disappears , in order to allow a fuller treatment in the body of the study .

		Much valuable new critical material is made use of and the desire to throw upon the study all pos - sible light is everywhere apparent .

		When this monument of scholarly investigation appeared , in
1874	DATE	, it was at once recognized as authori - tative , and has held the position ever since : this new issue serves to clinch its claim .

		It is no disparagement of the similar labors of scholars like
Collier	PERSON	and -LRB- later -RRB-
Fleay	PERSON	, to de - clare that Dr.
Ward	PERSON	's survey of the native drama on its objective side as stage product , and on its subjective as literature , stands alone among scholarly achievements by Englishmen .

		The prime merit of the work , aside from thoroughness , good judgment in ample illustra - tion , and the deduction of sound principles therefrom , lies in this giving of due attention to the history of the stage , while at the samf time keeping the student to a realization of the A HISTORY or KHOLISH DRAMATIC LJTXRATURB to the

		THE DIAL 121 drama 's literary splendors .

		The futility of much of the conventional older criticism has been the result of a disproportionate treatment of the product as literature alone , overlooking the fact that , being in play-form , it demands attention first of all as drama drama in its technique as well as in its imaginative triumphs .

		Dr.
Ward	PERSON	interweaves the two complementary aspects of the study with noteworthy skill , and this generates a feeling of reliance upon his conclusions .

		The scope of his investigation is , of course , very wide .

		It involves tracing the rise of the earliest English drama from the altar-end of the
Mother Church	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- with a side - glance at the secular influence of minstrelsy -RRB- , its rapid development in the cruder forms of miracle , mystery , and morality ; its first at - tempts at tragedy and comedy formed on the classic -LRB- mostly Latin -RRB- model ; the growth of Shakespeare and his school ; the decadence of that golden product through the
Stuart	PERSON	reigns ; the change to the
Restoration Comedy	ORGANIZATION	, with its brilliant wit , its literary polish , and its social indecency , all this conducting the student to the epoch of Queen
Anne	PERSON	and closing with a look at
Steele	PERSON	and
Addison	PERSON	as dramatists , thus stopping short of the classic late eight - eenth century comedy of
Sheridan	PERSON	and Gold - smith .

		It would be a great service to the cause of dramatic criticism if some scholar equally equipped should take up the discussion here , tell us the story of the drama under the
Georges	PERSON	, and then trace the now evident , and not unim - portant , revival of English-speaking drama within the past twenty years under such foreign influence as that of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	and
Maeterlinck	PERSON	.

		Enough has been accomplished already in cur - rent stage literature to justify such a study and to forecast the future in no pessimistic mood .

		Dr.
Ward	PERSON	exhibits what I may call a sort of sublimated common-sense when it comes to the enunciation of principles .

		He has a literary perception -LRB- not to be gained necessarily by any amount of study -RRB- which one trusts more and more as one reads further .

		The survey of the scholar work done outside our own language is broad , showing a critic quite free from insu - larity .

		And while the manner of these illumi - nating essays can hardly be called brilliant , it is entirely free from pedantic stiffness or ob - scurity , and makes an impression , on the whole , of sober elegance .

		Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	on the elder dramatists , for example , gives us more sensa - tional reading , but is as unsafe a guide as Dr.
Ward	PERSON	is a safe one .

		As an instance of the value of this contribution to the study of the poetic drama , take his admirable monograph -LRB- Vol .

		I. , Chap .

		IV . -RRB-

		on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, in which is given an account of the growth of the mas - ter 's fame .

		It would be difficult , even in the mass of similar attempts , to indicate another eighty pages which tell so much so well , and are so little open to criticism .

		Dr.
Ward	PERSON	's sense of proportion is happily demonstrated here by the half-page he devotes to a mention of the Baconian theory .

		The critical estimate of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's qualities as a writer is also worthy of all praise for its union of perception and balance : the power of character-creation being placed above all else , and some very sen - sible words spoken concerning the poet 's ability in construction , which , however much it has been surpassed by modern playwrights , was certainly vastly ahead of his time .

		In view of the amount of excellent criticism on the Elizabethan period which exists in En - glish , the treatment in the third volume of the later writers , and especially the Queen
Anne	PERSON	writers , has particular value .

		This critic 's independence and originality of thought appear to advantage in his closing remarks on the tail - end of the Stuart drama .

		Nothing in the whole course of the exposition better illustrates his method and habit of bringing a literary pro- duct into vital connection with the national life , thereby to explain both its merits and defects .

		It was because the plays of the
Stuart	PERSON	reigns were untrue to '' the higher purposes of the dramatic art , to the nobler tendencies of the national life , and to the eternal demands of moral law , '' says Dr.
Ward	PERSON	, '' that its his - tory is that of a decay such as no brilliancy , either borrowed or original , can conceal . ''

		In tracing the personal history of the dramatists , he spares no pains to sift all the evidence and present the reader with the probabilities ; but dogmatism is refreshingly absent the kind of theorizing which makes such criticism as that of Fleay so attractive that the student is in danger of forgetting that clever assumption , not fact , is before him .

		A word should be said as to the very hand - some and handy three-volume form which the publishers have given to this revision of a standard work , this form being an indication of the amount of new matter which has been incorporated .

		The dress is at once dignified and cheerful , and will of itself serve to win general readers for a work which the special student will need no external allurements to possess himself of and absorb .

Sept. 1	DATE	, '' THRONE-MAKERS * AND OTHERS .

		The men and the nations that fight for free - dom and justice , as was said by Senator
Hoar	PERSON	in a recent speech , are the men and the nations that live in the grateful memory of mankind not the men or nations who fight for domin - ion or empire .

		The sketches of Kossuth and
Garibaldi	PERSON	, in Mr.
William Roscoe Thayer	PERSON	's '' Throne-Makers , '' will probably give greater pleasure to his readers than those on
Bismarck	PERSON	and
Napoleon III	PERSON	.

		The title of '' throne-maker '' strikes one as not the happiest possible to apply to
Kossuth	LOCATION	, the president-governor of independent Hun - gary : nor , for that matter , do we think of
Garibaldi	LOCATION	'' the lifelong champion of democ - racy , '' as Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	himself calls him as preeminently a king-maker .

		But the two studies are welcome under any title , that on the Hungarian hero the more so from the widely prevalent ignorance on all matters per - taining to Austro-Hungarian history .

		The historian
Freeman	PERSON	has told how it was not un - usual for him to '' come across people who believed that
Austria	LOCATION	was one land inhabited by ' Austrians ' who spoke the ' Austrian ' lan - guage '' ; and
M. Louis Leger	PERSON	relates , in a pre - fatory note to the fourth edition of his history of Austro-Hungary , that when the municipality of
Prague	LOCATION	sent a set of its publications to a cer - tain French society , the president of the latter , in acknowledging the gift , expressed his regret at not being able to profit by the favor , owing to his ignorance of the Hungarian language * The story of
Hungary	LOCATION	's struggle for the restoration of her acknowledged rights will always be an interesting one , and certain de - tails in that story point a useful object lesson at the present time .

		The quarrels between the Hungarian generals and the civil authorities , the unfortunate refusal of the Magyars to grant to the Croats , the Serbs and the Wallachs , those very privileges for which they themselves were fighting , these and other incidents of the upheaval of
1848	DATE	in
Hungary	LOCATION	suggest cer - tain parallels in more recent history .

		Garibaldi takes the author into what is apparently his favorite field of study , Italian history . ''

		popularly suppose , but romanti - . ''

		The very paradox here goes far toward convincing us , but when we read elsewhere in the book that '' it is a truism that Science has advanced farther in our century than in all preceding time , '' we are inclined to doubt whether the author himself is fully persuaded that this is not , first and foremost , an age of material progress , after all .


Garibaldi	PERSON	's autobiography furnishes a large part of the material for Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	's sketch , and it will surprise most read - ers to learn how comparatively small a part of the Italian hero 's eventful career and martial exploits had to do with the land of his birth and of his affections .

		The secret of Napoleon the Little 's power is put in a way that is worth quoting .

		`` In oar individual lives we realize the power of memory , suggestion , association .

		If we have ever yielded to a vice , we have felt , it may be years after , how the sight of the old conditions revives the old temptation .

		A glance , a sound , a smell , may be enough to conjure up a long series of events , whether to grieve or to tempt us , with more than their original intensity .

		So we learn that the safest way to escape the enticement is to avoid the conditions .

		Recent psychology has at last begun to measure the subtle power of suggestion . ''

		But now suppose that instead of an individual a whole nation has had a terrific experience of succumbing to temptation , and that a cunning , unscrupulous man , aware of the force of association and reminiscence , de - liberately applies both to reproduce those conditions in which the nation first abandoned itself to excess : the case we have supposed is that of
France	LOCATION	and
Louis Napoleon	PERSON	.

		Before the reality of their story the ro - mances of hypnotism pale . ''

		Apropos of
Napoleon	PERSON	's appeal to his country - men 's patriotism , that '' last refuge of a scoun - drel , '' Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	takes occasion to distinguish between glory and gloire , as follows : '' Glory implies something essentially noble , nay in the Lord 's Prayer it is a quality attributed to God him - self : but gloire suggests vanity ; it is the food braggarts famish after .

		The minute men at
Concord	LOCATION	earned true glory ; but when the
United States	LOCATION	, listening to the seductions of evil politicians , attacked and blasted a decrepit power , fivefold smaller in population , twenty - fold weaker in resources , they might find gloire among their booty , but glory , never . ''

		Following the '' Throne-Makers '' are four '' Portraits , '' -- of
Carlyle	LOCATION	,
Tintoretto	PERSON	-LRB- or Tin - toret , as Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	chooses to write it -RRB- ,
Gior	PERSON	- dano
Bruno	PERSON	, and
Bryant	PERSON	.

		Of these the Italian studies show the most pains .

		That on
Bruno	LOCATION	, which is based largely on
Berti	ORGANIZATION	's life of the martyr and on the minutes of the Venetian Inquisition , closes with perhaps not the very happiest attempt to point the moral of the story .

		The writer gravely assures his readers that '' no tribunal , whether religious or political ,
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 123 has a right to coerce the conscience and inmost thoughts of any human being '' ; and he adds the stock allusions to
Torquemada	ORGANIZATION	and
Loyola	LOCATION	and
Galileo	ORGANIZATION	, duly informing us that the latter was threatened with the rack for daring to oppose a theory of the solar system which no school-boy of ten could now uphold without being set in the corner with a fool 's - cap on his head all of which would be most excellent in an undergraduate 's prize essay .

		The chapter on
Tintoretto	ORGANIZATION	in which , from the meagerest of materials , the man is made to stand before us , living and breathing , while from his works we are made acquainted with the painter merits high praise , although the writer 's enthusiasm will be generally thought to have broken bounds when he pronounces this artist '' the mightiest genius who ever honored painting . ''

		An eloquent plea for the preserva - tion of
Tintoretto	ORGANIZATION	's fading canvasses is followed by a series of vivid word-pictures of his prin - cipal paintings .

		Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	shows in these brief studies a faculty for going straight to the heart of the matter and for carrying his readers with him .

		The apt statement of some truth , whether new or old , is not infrequently met with in his pages , as when he says that ''
Bryant	PERSON	interprets nature morally ,
Emerson	PERSON	spiritually , and
Shelley	PERSON	emo - tionally , '' and again when he calls
Carlyle	PERSON	the
Michael Angelo	PERSON	of British prose-writers .

		Oc - casionally , too , his style betrays a refreshing originality and picturesqueness , as in his ref - erence to
Walt Whitman	PERSON	, '' with cowboy gait , swaggering up
Parnassus	LOCATION	, shouting nicknames at the Muses and ready to slap Apollo on the back . ''

		Some of his verdicts as , for exam - ple , his estimate of Carlyle as '' a historian without rival '' will not pass unchallenged ; but they are honest opinions and ably defended .

		Most of these essays , be it said in conclusion , were first published in various periodicals .

		entered .

		At the time of the World 's
Colum	PERSON	- bian Exposition at
Chicago	LOCATION	, he displayed a large exhibit , and printed a paper upon its clas - sification and bearings that was notably sug - gestive .

		Later , and in part at least from the influence of the Exposition , he studied the games of the
Hermit Kingdom	LOCATION	and prepared his beautiful book `` Korean Games . ''

		This book , while chiefly devoted to Korean , made use also of Chinese and Japanese games for comparison and was the most important Amer - ican contribution to game study at that time .

		Mr.
Culin	PERSON	's attention was then turned to Amer - ican Indian games , of which , with the aid of Mr.
Frank Hamilton Gushing	PERSON	, he made a dili - gent investigation .

		Some results of this and preceding studies were exhibited at the
Cotton States	LOCATION	and
International Exposition	ORGANIZATION	at
Atlanta	LOCATION	in
1885	DATE	.

		The exhibit was considered of such interest and value that a gold medal was awarded it .

		In Mr.
Culin	PERSON	's latest work , `` Chess and Play ing-Cards , '' we have a treatise based upon and growing out of this collection .

		It fills some 270 pages , and is amply illustrated .

		The atti - tude of the author may be best shown by a quo - tation : '' The object of this collection is to illustrate the probable origin , significance , and development of the games of chess and playing-cards .

		Following up the suggestion made to the writer by Mr.
Frank H. Gush	PERSON	- ing , they are both regarded as derived from the divin - atory use of the arrow , and as representing the two principal methods of arrow-divination .

		Incidental to the main subjects , various games and divinatory pro- cesses having a like origin , although not leading directly to chess or cards , are exhibited , as well as specimens of each class from various countries .

		The basis of the divinatory systems from which games have arisen is assumed to be the classification of all things according to the Four Directions .

		This method of classification is practically universal among primitive peoples both in
Asia	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	.

		In order to classify objects and events which did not in themselves reveal their proper assignment resort was had to magic .

		Survivals of these magical processes constitute our present games ... In the classification of things according to the four quarters we find that a numerical ratio was assumed to exist between the several categories .

		The discovery of this ratio was regarded as an all-important clue .

		The cubical dotted die represented one of the implements of magic employed for this purpose .

		The cubical die belongs , however , to a comparatively late period in the history of games and divination .

		The almost universal object for determining number , and thence by counting , place or direction , is three or more wooden staves , usu - ally flat on one side and rounded upon the other .

		Nu - merical counts are attributed to their several falls . ''

		As an example of a simple game , where moves along a definite track are determined by the fall of staves , our author cites the Korean 124 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, nyout .

		A game , identically the same in prin - ciple , is found throughout a wide range in
Asia	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	.

		It is represented by our Par - cheesl or Royal Game of
India	LOCATION	.

		Such games in
Asia	LOCATION	are usually clearly related to lot-sticks , or slips .

		These in turn are considered successors of ancient thrown arrows .

		Our author 's presen - tation of American Indian games is most inter - esting .

		The game of plumstones is widespread .

		This is a gambling game in which dice made usually of fruit pits are shaken in a basket and the result counted .

		In some cases games are played with teeth of the beaver or woodchuck , which are marked : these are thrown and the marks showing are counted .

		Distinct from these are the staves games , with a diagram along which pieces are moved according to counts thrown .

		In some of these latter games these staves are or can be shown to be divina - tion arrows .

		One interesting fact brought out by Mr.
Culin	PERSON	is that in sets of four staves , three are of one form while the fourth is dif - ferent .

		There is evidence , both morphological and linguistic , that this fourth distinctive staff represents the ancient arrow-throwing stick , while the others represent ancient arrows .

		Of course most students of games study them for evidence of migrations and contacts .

		Mr.
Culin	PERSON	is cautious in making statements along this line .

		Presumably though he may be undergoing conversion he holds the view now in vogue in this country , that no such evi - dence is carried by them and that similarities are due to psychic uniformity and are inde - pendent growths .

		The psychic .

		uniformity ar - gument is just now so popular that it begins to look somewhat threadbare .

		It is suggest - ive that Mr.
Culin	PERSON	finds the nyout series of games , abundant in
Asia	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	two areas where we should expect to find similari - ties on the basis of theories that antedate the present psychic uniformity craze .

		The present reviewer would suggest that it may be worth while to separate American Indians into groups of probably differing origins .

		From such a point of view it might be interesting to map the tribes , on the basis of games , into areas of the nyout type and the plumstone type .

		The areas would certainly overlap , but presumably an area would be found where the nyout type is absent and the plumstone game prevails .

		This area might be profitably studied in connection with the old-world area , where cubical dice are used independent of a nyout diagram .


Europe	LOCATION	, on the whole , appears to be such an area .

		Cu - bical dice with marked faces were there used in prehistoric times .

		The story of their origin from astragali , first natural and then artificial , has been made out : Mr.
Culin	PERSON	restates it .

		Perhaps these suggestions will prove worthless in the light of increased knowledge .

		That the plays in chess were at first deter - mined by throws is quite certain .

		That Chi - nese and Korean playing-cards are derived from divination arrows and that lot-slips have the same origin , Mr.
Culin	PERSON	makes clear .

		Our chess and our playing-cards have been derived from , or largely influenced by , the Oriental games .

		Wonder is sometimes expressed why cards , apparently devised for simple play , are used in fortune telling .

		The truth is the play , not the divination , is derived .

		The gypsy wo - men telling fates with cards is survival , not afterthought .

		One may see how much of curious interest comes out in Mr.
Culm	PERSON	's book .

		Yet he has not printed all his important studies .

		He is working along a dozen other lines .

		Just as we write this notice , his paper on u Hawaiian Games '' comes to hand .

		It aims at fair com - pleteness , but is entirely descriptive , going into neither discussion nor theory .

		Ninety-one games are described .

		Some are simple : others are quite complex .

		Some , like cat 's - cradle , maika -LRB- the famous bowling game , played with discoidal stones upon a specially prepared course -RRB- and pu-he-ne-he-ne -LRB- a gambling , hiding , game -RRB- present particularly interesting points for investigation .

		While the treatment is specifically of Hawaiian games , comparative material is continually introduced from other Polynesian islands .

		THE
MISSOURI	LOCATION	COMPROMISE AND ITS REPEAL .

		* The vacancy in the
United States Senate	ORGANIZATION	, caused by the resignation and subsequent death of
Henry Clay	PERSON	, was filled by the election for the remainder of the unexpired term of
Archibald Dixon	PERSON	of
Kentucky	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Dixon	PERSON	was a pro-slavery Whig of some local reputa - tion .

		He had been Lieutenant-Governor of his
State	ORGANIZATION	, had strenuously opposed gradual eman - cipation in the Constitutional Convention of
1849	DATE	, and had been defeated for the governor - ship in the state election just passed .

		Illness compelled Mr.
Dixon	PERSON	's absence from the Sen - THE TRUE HISTORY or THE

Archibald Dixon	PERSON	.

Robert Clarke Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		1899 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 125 ate during the greater part of the second session of the Thirty-second
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		At this session , a bill for the organization , without mention of slavery , of the territory west of
Missouri	LOCATION	, passed the
House	ORGANIZATION	and failed in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	.

		The South would not organize that territory without slavery , and the North would not or - ganize it with slavery .

		At the next session of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	,
Douglas	PERSON	introduced his celebrated
Nebraska	LOCATION	Bill .

		The bill and its accompanying report were artfully constructed in order to draw Southern votes , upon the theory that the bill repealed the
Missouri	LOCATION	Compromise , and Northern ones upon the theory that it did not .

		On
January 16 , 1854	DATE	, Mr.
Dixon	PERSON	, either fear - ing the issue or preferring a straightforward course , gave notice of a motion to amend the bill by a direct repeal of the
Missouri	LOCATION	restric - tion , and thus forced
Douglas	PERSON	to incorporate direct repeal in his bill very nearly in the form in which it finally passed .

		But for this motion , Mr.
Dixon	PERSON	would never have been heard of .

		As it constitutes his only connection with Amer - ican history , we might not inappropriately call him '' single motion ''
Dixon	PERSON	.

		With this motion as a climax , Mr.
Dixon	PERSON	's widow has written a bulky book of over six hundred pages , which she calls `` The True History of the
Missouri	LOCATION	Compromise and its Repeal , '' and dedicates it to '' The
Truth of History	ORGANIZATION	and the People of the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		The author tells us that the work was begun the year after Mr.
Dixon	PERSON	's death , in
1876	DATE	; that her library and the partially completed manuscript were destroyed by fire in
1893	DATE	, so that the work had to be re-written .

		The book is evidently a labor of love , undertaken as a memorial to her husband and completed with great difficulty .

		Under the circumstances we sincerely regret that we can not commend the result .

		Mrs.
Dixon	PERSON	possesses the qualifications neither for writing impartial history nor for making a special plea .

		Her material is drawn almost exclusively from the speeches of radical pro-slavery members of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, a study of which seems to have warped her judgment and corrupted her English .

		The book is encum - bered with long quotations from these speeches , many of them of slight importance , and the style is marred by such expressions as '' defeat was a bitter pill '' and '' hypocrite of the first water . ''

		She treats successively the slavery compromises of the Constitution , the
Compro	LOCATION	- mises of
1820	DATE	and
1850	DATE	, and the
Kansas	LOCATION	-
Nebraska	LOCATION	Act .

		In her view , the continuance of the slave trade until
1808	DATE	resulted from a bargain between the
New England States	LOCATION	on the one hand , and
South Carolina	LOCATION	and
Georgia	LOCATION	on the other , which made the North responsible for Southern slavery ; the
Missouri Compro	LOCATION	- mise was an unjust and unconstitutional act forced upon the South by Northern men , and the wrong of this act was finally redressed by the courage and sagacity of the '' Hon. Archi - bald
Dixon	PERSON	of
Kentucky	LOCATION	, true Author of the Repeal of the
Missouri	LOCATION	Compromise and be - loved husband of the writer , '' and these con - clusions are enforced by repeated assertion rather than by evidence and argument .

		The treatment of the
Missouri	LOCATION	Compromise is especially inconsistent and contradictory .

		Page after page is devoted to proof that Clay was not the author of the first Compromise , a fact now so well known that not even the tra - ditional schoolboy would need to be informed of it .

		Mrs.
Dixon	PERSON	admits that slavery excluded free labor from the territories `` as effectually as an act of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, '' and then denounces the Compromise of
1820	DATE	as working great injus - tice to the South by its exclusion of slave property .

		Why it was more unjust to exclude the Southern slave-owner by prohibiting slav - ery than to exclude the
Northern	ORGANIZATION	laborer by admitting it , does not appear .

		She insists that the Compromise was not a Southern measure ; though it was passed by
Southern	ORGANIZATION	votes and was hailed by
Southern	ORGANIZATION	men at the time as '' a great triumph . ''

		She denies that the
Missouri	LOCATION	act was a '' solemn compromise '' between the sections , though Clay so described it ; and then she reproaches the North for breaking a com - pact by delaying the admission of
Missouri	LOCATION	.

		She seems to consider that the
United States	LOCATION	and
Missouri	LOCATION	were the parties to the compact , as if
the State	ORGANIZATION	, in return for its admission by the
United States	LOCATION	, could guarantee the exclu - sion of slavery from territory beyond its limits .

		It is the same old chaff threshed over again .

		No amount of sophistry can make the
Missouri	LOCATION	act anything but a compact between the sec - tions .

		That it was not legally binding , must be admitted .

		That it was morally binding , can - not be gainsaid .

		The only contribution to history that Mrs.
Dixon	PERSON	's book makes is contained in the few pages devoted to the drafting of Mr.
Dixon	PERSON	's motion .

		Mrs.
Dixon	PERSON	was married in
October of 1853	DATE	, and acted as her husband 's amanuen - sis during the ensuing session of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		The value of her testimony is somewhat im - paired by her admission that at the time she understood little of what was going on , '' being 126 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, in fact another edition of Dora holding the pens , '' but it is nevertheless the testimony of an eye-witness .

		Mr.
Dixon	PERSON	dictated the motion to her the evening before it was introduced .

		She re-wrote it a number of times until it suited him , and he afterwards copied in his own hand the draft that he introduced in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the days following the motion , Mr.
Dixon	PERSON	's friends called to congratulate him upon the step he had taken , and
Douglas	PERSON	took him for the drive , during which he accepted the prin - ciple of Mr.
Dixon	PERSON	's motion and the two men made to each other the grandiloquent speeches , expressive of mutual esteem , which
Dixon	PERSON	after - wards repeated in his letter to
Foote	PERSON	.

		The important point of the narrative is that the motion came as a surprise to everyone , and that
Dixon	PERSON	made it upon his own initiative and without collusion with anyone .

		It has been charged that
Seward	PERSON	inspired
Dixon	PERSON	's motion , and this charge has recently been given an added importance by its accept - ance by so prominent and able a writer upon American history as is Professor
Burgess	PERSON	of Co -
lumbia University	ORGANIZATION	.

		In a review of Mr.
Rhodes	PERSON	's history , in the '' Political Science Quarterly , '' Mr.
Burgess	PERSON	said : '' Mr.
Seward	PERSON	ridiculed the doctrine of popular sov - ereignty , and knew that the passage of the
Nebraska	LOCATION	bill , with its ambiguous language about the abolition of the
Missouri	LOCATION	Compromise by the principle of the Com - promise of
1850	DATE	, would set the whole country on fire again over the subject of slavery .

		Yet , according to his own confession , he incited his Whig friend ,
Senator Dixon	PERSON	of
Kentucky	LOCATION	, to move the amendment to the bill which cleared away all ambiguity and proposed directly the abolition of the Compromise of
1820	DATE	; and he did this with the purpose of destroying the quiet of his country , rousing the slaveholders to violent words and deeds , and creating an issue upon which he might be borne into the presidency . ''

		Mr.
Burgess	PERSON	repeats this charge , though some - what less positively , in his admirable little book entitled The Middle Period . ''

		The only evidence upon which it rests is a statement by
Montgomery Blair	PERSON	that
Seward	PERSON	told him that '' he was the man who put
Archy Dixon	PERSON	up to moving the repeal of the
Missouri Compromise	ORGANIZATION	, as an amendment to
Douglas	PERSON	's first Kansas bill , and had himself forced the repeal by that movement , and had thus brought to life the Republican party . ''

		This statement was made in a letter written immediately after
Seward	ORGANIZATION	's death , for publication in an attack upon his memory .

		If it were true , it is certainly very extraordinary that
Seward	ORGANIZATION	should have made
Blair	PERSON	bis sole confidant , and that no other evi - dence of it has ever come to light .

		The charge is antecedently improbable .

		Seward and
Dixon	PERSON	were not friends , as is assumed ; and though nominally members of the same party , they were really as far apart politically as the poles .

		Neither of them was likely to do a service for or put himself in the power of the other .

		As the charge was not made until after
Seward	PERSON	's death , he never had an opportunity to meet it .

		Mr.
Dixon	PERSON	indignantly denied it as soon as it came to his notice , and now Mrs.
Dixon	PERSON	, nar - nating as an eye-witness the circumstances under which the motion was drafted , contrib - utes her testimony in support of the conclusion that Mr.
Dixon	PERSON	acted independently and with - out consultation with anyone .

		Whatever credit or discredit attaches to his motion belongs to him and to him alone .

		IN AUSTRALIAN WILDS .

		* The great continent of
Australia	LOCATION	has a pecu - liar fascination for adventurous spirits .

		Its as - tounding dimensions about 2500 miles from east to west , and
1600	DATE	miles from north to south , containing about 3,000,000 square miles furnish adequate territory for explorers through many years to come .

		The
last quarter century	DATE	has seen hundreds and thousands of prospectors rush to the wilds of that land in search of gold .

		While a few had '' a streak of luck , '' the great majority lost their all and many even their lives .

		Only a little rim around the coast of that new continent is occupied by enlightened peoples .

		The so-called districts of
Australia	LOCATION	flourish within easy reach of the sea , while the centre of the continent is almost one wild arid waste , covered with spinifex , a kind of desert grass , sand , and rocks , with only slight traces of life .

		Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	and a few companions landed in
Western Australia	LOCATION	in
September , 1892	DATE	, with their heads full of golden castles in the air .

		Into the mining regions of Coolgardie they plunged , eager to strike a vein of shiny metal .

		THE DIAL 127 nter the employ of a company .

		In this capac - ity they found a salable mine , and wisely sold out .

		The small section of Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	's vol - ume dealing with these experiences is full of valuable hints and facts regarding the gold hunter 's and miner 's life in that sandy , almost waterless , region of
Western Australia	LOCATION	.

		The most instructive , though somewhat extended , portion of the book recites the daring of Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	in setting out to traverse this great desert from south to north a distance of one thousand miles in a bee line .

		Other explorers of
Central Australia	LOCATION	had met various fates : some had gone never to return ; others had started with fully equipped expeditions , and had barely reached civilization again .

		This adventurer chose a route of his own ; and with four companions , nine camels , a dog , and food and equipment for six months , he started in midwinter to penetrate the desert from south to north .

		After four and a half months of weary wandering over a deviating course of 1,413 miles , he reached the northern rim of civiliza - tion .

		The most desperate want of explorers in this desert is water ; for days at a time , and sometimes even weeks , not a trace of water can be found , except dried-up or filthy pools in the hollows of rocks .

		But this desert is not abso - lutely uninhabited .

		The wild natives roam about in their solitude , living upon wild rats , snakes , birds , or whatever they can find .

		When the expedition had almost despaired of ever again finding water , a human footprint was found in the sand .

		It was followed , and a hundred yards ahead a wild man was seen digging up an iguana for his supper .

		He was caught , though only after a desperate struggle , and made fast by a rope .

		He was '' about five feet , eight inches , thin but muscu - lar , with very large feet and small hands , very black , very dirty ; his only garment consisted of a band of string round his forehead , holding his hair back in a ragged mop-like mass .

		On his chest , raised scars ; through his nose , a hole ready to hold a bone or stick such was this child of the wilderness . ''

		He was fed on salt beef , with the double object of cementing friend - ship and promoting thirst .

		With the native leading the way , the caravan marched many weary hours .

		He often deceived them by tak - ing them to dry pits or dirty pools .

		But finding that he could not escape from his captors , nor obtain a drink of water , he led the caravan to an out-of-the-way place , where one could see merely a hole in the rocks .

		Climbing down into this recess , Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	discovered signs of water ; after lighting a fire and sliding down another narrow opening , he found at the bot - tom of it an abundant well of cool fresh water .

		The native had saved their lives , for not one man in a thousand could have found this hidden treasure . ''

		From
Sep. 16th t Nov. 16th	DATE	we were never out of sight of a sand-ridge , and during that time traveled 420 miles , taking into account all deviations consequent upon steering for smokes and tracking up natives , giv - ing an average of not quite seven miles a day , including stoppages .

		This ghastly desert is somewhat broken in its northern portion by the occurrence of sandstone tablelands , the
Southesk Tablelands	LOCATION	; the southern part , ... presents nothing to the eye but ridge upon ridge of sand , running with the regularity of the drills in a ploughed field .

		A vast , howling wilderness of high , spinifex-clad ridges of red sand , so close together that in a day 's march we crossed from sixty to eighty ridges , so steep that often the camels had to crest them on their knees , and so barren and destitute of vegetation -LRB- sav - ing spinifex -RRB- that one marvels how even camels could pick up a living .

		I estimate their average vertical height from trough to crest at fifty to sixty feet .

		Some ... reached a height of considerably over one hundred feet .

		Sometimes the ridges would be a quarter of a mile apart , and sometimes ridge succeeded ridge like the waves of the sea . ''

		The expedition 's only salvation through all these weary marches was the frequent captivity of the wild natives of these trackless regions .

		Their familiarity with their roaming ground made them valuable to Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	, as they always knew where good water could be found .

		By
December 4	DATE
Hall 's Creek	ORGANIZATION	was reached , with the loss of one member of the expedition through an accident .

		After enjoying the good things of civilization for a time , the same com - pany , with a somewhat different equipment , plunged into the desert to return to
Coolgardie	LOCATION	, but by a somewhat different route .

		Their skill in capturing and controlling the natives , and in finding through them an abundance of water at frequent intervals , made this a much more satisfactory campaign .

		The author has prepared useful folding charts of the routes followed in these cam - paigns .

		They are so fully detailed as to make them of invaluable service to other explorers of these regions .

		Useful appendices describe some of the customs and weapons of the little - known natives , and the principal features of
Western Australia	LOCATION	.

		The whole story is told in direct , clear , plain English , with few pre - tenses of literary merit .

		Professor
Semon	PERSON	, of
Jena	PERSON	,
Germany	LOCATION	, is a naturalist who was so fortunate as to secure pecuniary support for a journey to
Australia	LOCATION	, to study the fauna , the oviparous animals , 128 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, marsupials , and the ceratodus , a fish .

		This volume -LRB- the English edition of a work which first appeared in German -RRB- is a narrative , almost a diary , of the author 's two years ' experience , observations , and thoughts .

		Its style is some - what grandiose , and its method of telling things rather long drawn out and often wearisome .

		One can not but feel that there is often a studied effort to say as much as can be said about almost every event or thing mentioned -LRB- for example pp. 118 , 121 -RRB- .

		The translator , too , is often at fault in not rendering the German into idiomatic English , for example -LRB- p. 161 -RRB- , in speaking of the egg of echidna , the author is made to say , '' it is very remindful of a tor - toise egg . ''

		But aside from the somewhat wearisome method of detail , to be seen in quotations given below , the book is full of genuine interest .

		This lies entirely in the facts presented , and in the author 's masterful knowledge of his own specialty .

		Although not writing a technical treatise , he still describes in a popular manner quite a variety of the fauna of
Australia	LOCATION	.

		His experience , however , on this continent was lim - ited to the eastern coast of
Queensland	LOCATION	, and to the islands adjacent to its most northern cape , with a short run through the
East Indies	LOCATION	.

		He describes in one long chapter and with ample detail the character of the natives with whom he dealt .

		His conclusion on one point is as follows : '' We find the intellect and senses of the Australian brilliantly developed in all directions bearing on the hunt , i. e. , an excessively sharp power of observation , topographic sense and memory , and a particular fac - ulty of drawing conclusions from the smallest signs and traces , as to the whereabouts , the occupations , and the actual state of the game .

		All this , combined with great dexterity in the use of weapons , makes any Australian game the helpless prey of these perfect huntsmen .

		Therefore it is a great error to represent Australians as a half-starved miserable race struggling for life under the hardest conditions .

		The very contrary is the case . ''

		Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	, who travelled more than three thousand miles through the wilds of
Australia	LOCATION	, and had larger observation , came to quite a different general conclusion in his '' Spinifex and Sand .

		1 ' But the really valuable information con - tributed in Professor
Semon	PERSON	's book lies not in its generalizations , but in its specific descriptions of local conditions and things .

		The habits of life , the character and peculiar significance of the Ceratodus -LRB- p. 90 Jr. -RRB- , the
Ornithorhyn	PERSON	- chus -LRB- p. 42/V -RRB- , the
Echidna	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- p. 157 / . -RRB-

		, and other less famous life of
Australia	LOCATION	, are set forth in a manner that will make a naturalist , for the time being , of any reader .

		The peculiar fauna , the topography of the islands , the lux - urious vegetation , the shrewd natives of the
East Indies	LOCATION	, are pictured with the same detail that we find regarding
Australia	LOCATION	.

		His descrip - tion of the Papuans of
New Guinea	LOCATION	possesses interest . ''

		The disposition of the Papuans is light and gay .

		Solemn and grave as is the mein and deportment of the old gentlemen , the laughing youth forms the domineer - ing element in every village .

		The Papuan is of a de - cidedly domestic turn , and has much taste for the joys of family life .

		Man and wife though most of the men boast several spouses are generally very fond of each other , the women especially being much attached to their husbands , by whom they are in general kindly treated ... The children grow up in full freedom and without restraint , drilling , or bullying of any kind .

		They thus form a happy assemblage , amiable and sym - pathetic if somewhat boisterous , ... so pleasing in their boldness and freedom from restraint that it is impossible to be angry with them . ''

		Regarding the Malays of
Java	LOCATION	, he says : '' I believe the Malays to be the cleanest of all un - civilized races .

		A warm climate in itself is by no means a guarantee of cleanly habits , and African negroes , Papuans , and , above all , the inhabitants of tropical Aus - tralia , show a deplorable disregard of these ... We may regard cleanliness as a national Malayan virtue . ''

		The greatest value of this work must be seen , then , in the careful observations of the author , the popular scientific descriptions he gives of men , beasts , fishes , fowls , lands , seas , jungles , villages , cities , governments , customs , rites , and everyday life as he found it in the south - eastern hemisphere .

		Four good maps aid the reader in following the journeys of the nat - uralist .

		THE DIAL 129 server .

		It appears to have been prepared , chiefly , before the late war with
Spain	LOCATION	, with the purpose of presenting to the people of the
United States	LOCATION	a plain , unvarnished , and unprejudiced account of our neighbors that skirt the
Caribbean	LOCATION	waters .

		The second of these volumes , by Mr.
William T. Clark	PERSON	, applies to
Cuba	LOCATION	only .

		Its author has inves - tigated the island with direct reference to its prom - ise as an opening for business enterprises from the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The book contains much important statistical information , and a pretty full gazetteer of the Cuban cities and towns .

		One who proposes entering
Cuba	LOCATION	for business , agricultural , mining , or commercial purposes will find that Mr.
Clark	PERSON	has foreseen and answered many of the questions which would naturally arise .

		The third is by Mr.
Robert P. Porter	PERSON	, well known as a publicist and as the Commissioner of the
United States	LOCATION	Census of
1890	DATE	.

		Soon after the signing of the protocol of peace between
Spain	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	,
August 12 , 1898	DATE	, Mr.
Porter	PERSON	was sent to
Cuba	LOCATION	by President
McKinley	PERSON	as a special commis - sioner to observe and report upon the conditions of the island , industrial , commercial , and financial .

		In the prosecution of his mission Mr.
Porter	PERSON	visited all the provinces and most of the cities and prin - cipal towns of
Cuba	LOCATION	, examined many witnesses , and collected a vast amount of evidence , personal and documentary .

		This volume , if not his report in exact form as made to the President , may be ac - cepted as his report to the American people , deal - ing with the vital questions that confront the repub - lic as to the new life to be presently entered upon by this hitherto unfortunate island , once called the Key of the New World .

		The official position of the writer and his recognized fitness for such a mission , lends to his work peculiar interest as well as a large measure of authority .

		Questions of great moment confront the people , both of the
United States	LOCATION	and of
Cuba	LOCATION	, as to the relations which these peoples may rightfully main - tain towards each other , and as to the wisest methods by which the solution of pending questions may be reached .

		These problems must receive immediate consideration .

		It is to be hoped that passion , pre - judice , and greed may not be permitted to dictate the adjustment of interests so momentous .

		But little more than a year ago , the strained rela - tions between our government and that of
Spain	LOCATION	came to a rupture .

		The conflict between
Spain	LOCATION	and her colony had assumed the phase of a war of ex - termination .

		In a brief period , five hundred thou - sand human beings , men , women , and children , had perished , a few in fight , most of them by starvation .

		The war was pitiless in its methods and inhuman in its purposes against the insurgents , including in general all born in the island , and all occupied as planters , with their employees and dependants .

		Impelled by motives both of humanity and self - interest , the government of the
United States	LOCATION	flung its sword into the scale .

		None , whether Spaniards , Cubans , or Americans , in the arena of combat , or of the throng of European spectators who crowded the galleries as interested observers , doubted for a moment the outcome of the combat .

		Few supposed that the Spaniard would or could yield to a demand upon paper until the virility of the demand was shown by the actual clash of arms .

		The lightning strokes came swiftly , and with an intensity which astonished even those who manipulated the dread artillery .

		Three rounds , one in the Bay of
Manila	LOCATION	, one on the heights above
Santiago	LOCATION	, and one in the sea before its harbor , sufficed to demonstrate even to Spanish pride the imperative logic of superior force .

		Then followed the overture of peace , the protocol , the treaty , the evacuation , the transfer of authority , the exchange of ratifications , and under the proclamation of the President peace again reigns at least as to our relations with
Spain	LOCATION	.

		The combatants may now estimate their losses , count their gains , and strike a balance .

		The Span - ish Queen Regent may enter up the loss of prestige , the loss of fleets , and the loss of the last of her once imperial colonies .

		As to this , may we not find in Queen
Christina	PERSON	another
Christiana	LOCATION	, from whose weary shoulders falls a most oppressive burden ?

		One can imagine her , like the Apostle , having long prayed , '' Who shall deliver me from the body of this death ? ''

		Perhaps before the altar of her hu - miliation , the wailing music of the Miserere becomes transposed into the rejoicing strains of the
Te Deum	ORGANIZATION	.

Sam	PERSON	will write in his note - book that he has fulfilled his promise by lifting the yoke from the suffering Cubans , that he has ac - quired a fine collection of islands , and that he has paid twenty millions for a white elephant still at large in the jungle .

		The actual value of the ele - phant as yet appears to be res non adjudicata .

		Here , as everywhere , the future treads upon the heels of the past .

		From the President to the hum - blest citizen , everyone is asking , What is to be done with
Cuba	LOCATION	?

		Can there be any doubt that our gov - ernment should , with wise deliberation , proceed to fulfil the promise made when
Congress	ORGANIZATION	declared that ''
Cuba	LOCATION	is , and of right ought to be , free '' ?

		Is there any reason to doubt that events are moving toward that end as rapidly as the conditions will reasonably permit ?

		A most important step was the payment and disbanding of the Cuban army .

		Now the pressing need is the active resumption of agri - cultural occupations , which will signalize the actual return to the normal conditions of peaceful life .

		To the American mind there can be little doubt that the ultimate good of
Cuba	LOCATION	, to herself , will be found in annexation to the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Her position among the nations as a member of this powerful republic will be of far more importance than that which she could maintain as a young and feeble , though independent state , even if she were to continue to enjoy the protection of her strong neighbor .

		Entering into the republic , she would enjoy , as fully as do the other states , the benefits of home rule in all questions that concern local inter - ests and social life , and perhaps more fully than , 180 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, in her present stage of political education , she could profit by in the highest degree .

		At the same time she would participate in all the advantages arising from a strong national organization , with - out either the cost or the difficulty of establishing and maintaining them by herself .

		It is like the opportunity offered to a young advocate of admis - sion to an old , strong , and successful firm .

		Her share in the support of an army and
navy	ORGANIZATION	, in the conduct of foreign affairs , the collection of revenue , the maintenance of a postal service , etc. , would be far less in amount and far greater in returns if she were e pluribus unum than if she were doing all these things for herself , by herself .

		Since the close of hostilities , time has not sufficed for a readjustment of affairs in accordance with changed conditions , but some financial reliefs have already made themselves felt The most important of these is the removal of excessive Spanish exac - tions .

		The assessments of the Spanish govern - ment upon
Cuba	LOCATION	in the fiscal year 1895-96 were
$ 24,756,760	MONEY	, increased by the peculations of public officials , estimated at ten millions more , making a grand total of about
$ 35,000,000	MONEY	.

		Of this sum ,
$ 17,996,842	MONEY	was applied to purposes deter - mined by dependency upon
Spain	LOCATION	, as the army , navy , military and civil pensions , and especially ten and one-half millions of interest upon the Spanish debt .

		Of the thirty-five millions exacted under Spanish misrule , only about seven millions , or twenty per cent , will survive liberation from Spanish sov - ereignty .

		The sums formerly expended for local government , for public improvement , for education , may be largely increased , as doubtless they ought to be , and still the exactions by government be only a small fraction of their former extravagance .

		This result would be certain to follow under the methods of
United States	LOCATION	rule .

		Moreover , the
United States	LOCATION	has been and is the Cuban 's best customer .

		In
1890	DATE	,
Cuba	LOCATION	's exports to the
United States	LOCATION	amounted roundly to
$ 58,500	MONEY	, - 000 , or 88 per cent of the total for the year .


Spain	LOCATION	was the next best customer , taking II .

		1 , per cent .

		In the
five years ending June 30 , 1895	DATE	,
Cuba	LOCATION	's ex - ports to the
United States	LOCATION	amounted to nearly
$ 347,000,000	MONEY	.

		These aggregates will surely be subject to large expansion whenever the barriers are removed which separate the two countries as foreign nations .

		The devices adopted by the Span - ish government to repress production , and by so doing to increase importations , and therefore rev - enue , strike an American singularly .

		In
Cuba	LOCATION	, cul - tivators of cocoa have paid on their product a revenue tax of
5.7 cents	MONEY	per pound ; of coffee ,
5.4 cents	MONEY	per pound .

		In
Porto Rico	LOCATION	, such agricultural products as maize and potatoes paid an internal revenue tax .

		Importation , which added to customs dues , was preferred to cultivation .

		The pledge of our nation will forbid annexation on any terms that do not command the sentiment and the suffrages of the Cubans themselves .

		Will they discern the facts and the trend of their true interests ?

		Should any doubt arise as to the desirability of the annexation of
Cuba	LOCATION	to the
United States	LOCATION	, it should be found among the citizens of the
Union	LOCATION	rather than from Cubans .

		The American is very likely to be incredulous as to the capacity of the Cuban for self-government .

		The examples shown by other nations of the same stock are hardly en - couraging .

		For four hundred years the islander has vegetated under the enervating rigiine of a colonial despotism .

		He has suffered under constant disabilities and ruinous exactions .

		What immuni - ties he has enjoyed he has bought secretly on terms as injurious to his own fine fibre as to that of him whom he bribed .

		It takes a long and patient schooling to educate national character , and , un - fortunately , the only school is that of experience , which allows nothing for novices .

		Such education the English colonist received during a century and a half before he took up the burden of a separate national existence .

		The experience was severe , but it stiffened his muscular fibre and developed his backbone ; and such an experience the Spaniard has not received .

		The English and the Spanish races were not cast in the same moulds , and are not likely to run smoothly in the same grooves .

		Americans err who imagine that there is terri - tory in
Cuba	LOCATION	in a condition similar to that of the once wild country of the great American plains , or that of the
Pacific Coast	LOCATION	.

		Uncultivated lands are plenty , but , technically considered , no lands are un - occupied .

		There are no land titles to be vacated , no lands to be surveyed and brought into market , to be sold by government agents to any purchasers who may lay down a price fixed by law .

		Lands may be bought and sold , but only as in
Connecticut	LOCATION	or
Virginia	LOCATION	, at the option of a present owner .

		The Cuban will be glad to deal with the Amer - ican , if he will stay on his own side of the water .

		He will be most happy to use American capital , if the American will not insist on sitting down beside him and sharing the management .

		The cry of
Cuba	LOCATION	for Cubans '' has already arisen , and it will become more intense should large inroads be made by Americans upon Cuban territory .

		The carpet - bag will be quite as serious an offense in
Cuba	LOCATION	as it ever was in our own South .

		The development of
Cuba	LOCATION	is likely to benefit the colored race .

		The repulsion which exists between the races in the
States	LOCATION	shows itself in no compar - able degree in the island .

		The twilight zone of mixed blood is wide in
Cuba	LOCATION	, and the gradations are not clearly marked , while the lines in the South are becoming more sharply defined .

		In
1887	DATE	the population of
Cuba	LOCATION	was 1,631,677 , of whom 485 , - 187 were of African dtwent .

		The present popu - lation is supposed to be about 1,300,000 , of whom 300,000 are of African blood .

		The differences indicate in a degree the loss of life produced by the system called reconcentration , '' which was most
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 131 severely felt by the laboring classes .

		These losses point to a loss in the supply of labor , and to a future demand that may draw labor from the
Southern States	LOCATION	.

		The commercial interests of both
Cuba	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	will be favored by the admission of
Cuba	LOCATION	into the
Union	LOCATION	; and such interests are likely to prevail .

		The sentiment of the Cuban may pre - fer independence .

		The sentiment of a considerable body of the people of the
States	LOCATION	doubts the wisdom of bringing into the American system any country not educated in American political and social econ - omy , and dreads to have such an element as one of Spanish descent domiciled in the
American Senate	ORGANIZATION	.

		Under the pledges solemnly given by our govern - ment to
Cuba	LOCATION	, to
Spain	LOCATION	, and to the world , the
United States	LOCATION	may not lay upon
Cuba	LOCATION	the mailed hand of the conqueror .

		She must be joined to the
United States	LOCATION	, if at all , as the result of her own choice , freely made .

		Literary relation , M '
Joseph Texte	PERSON	's Jean-Jacques between
France Rousseau	ORGANIZATION	and the Cosmopolitan and
England	LOCATION	.

		g pirit in Literature '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a study of the literary relations between
France	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	during the eighteenth century .

		M. Texte has produced a decidedly acute and valuable essay in this rich yet comparatively unworked field of critical research , and in Mr.
J. W. Matthews	PERSON	he has found a competent translator .

		Mme. De StaeTs observation that '' There exist two entirely distinct literatures , that which springs from the South and that which springs from the North , '' would not to-day meet with that unqualified assent with which Frenchmen , especially , used to hail it .

		The central idea of Mme. De StaeTs theory , the habit of contrasting Latin with non-Latin tradition , Southern literature with Northern '' humanism , '' remains ; but it is recognized that while Mme. De StaeTs distinction still holds good in substance , the sway of the old '' classical '' spirit is no longer supreme and undisputed in French literature , and it is now a question whether or no
France	LOCATION	will in the future preserve that veneration for antiquity to which the national intellect adhered for three or four centuries .

		She has for a hundred years past drifted in a measure from her ancient moorings into the current followed by the younger and more self-sufficing literatures .

		Will she return to
Greece	LOCATION	, to
Rome	LOCATION	, to the French classics ?

		Or will she turn to
England	LOCATION	, to
Germany	LOCATION	, to
Russia	LOCATION	, in fine , to the North ?

		The origin of the influence of the classical spirit upon the French genius has been fully dis - cussed ; that of the rival cosmopolitan spirit has been infrequently , and , M. Texte thinks , very inaccurately , dealt with .

		In the present work he endeavors to supply this want of a thorough and impartial inquest into the origin and bearings of cosmopolitanism , going back not merely , as is usually done , to the romantic school , but to the eighteenth century and to
Rousseau	PERSON	for it was he who , '' on behalf of the Germanic races of
Europe	LOCATION	, struck a blow at the time-honored supremacy of the Latin races . ''

		M. Texte 's central aim is to exhibit
Rousseau	PERSON	as the great creator of a taste and need in
France	LOCATION	for the literatures of the North . ''

		The cosmopolitan spirit was born , during the eighteenth century , of the fruitful union between the English genius and that of Jean-Jacques . ''

		Such is the thesis of
M. Texte	ORGANIZATION	's book .

		It is quite true , as the author concedes , that English influence was potent in
France	LOCATION	before
Rousseau	PERSON	had begun to write .

		The revocation of the
Edict of Nantes	ORGANIZATION	founded in
England	LOCATION	a colony of French propagandists in their fatherland , of English ideas , not alone nor most momentously in the field of literature .

		Conceive for an instant the normal and inevitable effect of the doctrines of
Locke	PERSON	upon a keenly intelligent , profoundly discon - tented , and barbarously misgoverned nation , like the French of the eighteenth century .

		When
the Grand Monarch	ORGANIZATION	drove that band of active-minded , observant Protestant subjects of his to speculative , freedom-loving
England	LOCATION	it was as if he had in effect bade them : '' Go among these rebellious , free - thinking islanders , study their ways , taste their liberty , imbibe their ideas , and send the results of your observations and comparisons back to
France	LOCATION	that she , too , may understand the rationale and learn the lessons of the movements of
1649	DATE	and
1688	DATE	. ''

		M. Texte 's appreciations of
Sterne	PERSON	and
Richardson	PERSON	are most interesting .

		On the whole , the book is one of the freshest and most stimulating critical studies that it has been our good fortune to meet with of late , and it is decidedly readable , as well as instructive .

		Theiooked-for Lord
Charles Beresford	PERSON	's `` The `` Break-up '' Break-Up of
China	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- is of
China	LOCATION	.

		substantially a printed report of the author 's recent tour of investigation in
China	LOCATION	at the instance of the
Associated Chambers of Commerce of Great Britain	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a volume of statistics rather than a travel-book proper , written without literary pretension , and with little or no view to the mere entertainment of the reader .

		While the report deals chiefly with purely commercial questions , the author has not denied himself an occasional flight into the region of '' high politics '' ; and his familiar , and we think substantially sound , views as to the expedi - ency and propriety of upholding the political and geographical integrity of the
Chinese Empire	ORGANIZATION	and the securing therein a fair , free , and well safe - guarded field for trade , in the interest of all ,
China	LOCATION	not excepted , are restated and reinforced .

		Lord
Beresf	PERSON	ord takes a too sanguine view , apparently , of the not remote future possibilities of the present , we fear , rather ephemeral and sentimental
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	- American entente cordiale .

		Does not Anglo-Sax - onism mean , after all , to the British mind something 132 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, very like anti-Russianism ?

		Is there not at the root of this new idea , as it floats in the mind of the av - erage Briton , more of apprehension than of broth - erly love ?

		Then there is our `` foreign vote , '' so largely and bitterly an anti-English vote , and a most formidable bar in the way of our government 's accomplishing or even proposing anything however useful or broadly philanthropic in the way of a for - mal understanding with
England	LOCATION	.

		A Dreibund , uniting for certain specific commercial purposes
America	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	, and
Germany	LOCATION	, might be feasible certainly more feasible than anything in the nature of an Anglo-American alliance , against which our imperfectly Americanized fellow-citizens would at once join forces , and for whose support one or other of our leading political parties would infallibly bid .

		To an American these considera - tions may be obvious and elementary enough ; but our English friends seem to overlook them .

		Lord
Beresford	PERSON	noted , manifestly to his disappointment , that the pretty general acquiescence in this country in the '' Open Door '' principle had not got beyond the stage of mere sentiment .

		People here applauded his remarks on the subject , and were very friendly and cordial ; but they were evidently not inclined to view the question of devising a definite policy looking to the furtherance and safe-guarding of American trade in
China	LOCATION	as yet within the range of practical politics .

		In
Japan	LOCATION	, on the contrary , there was '' every indication of a desire to act in some practical manner in order to secure the '' Open Door . ''

		Lord
Beresford	PERSON	's book is a useful and thorough presentation of current trade conditions in the Chinese Empire , and it conveys a fair idea of what may be done and must be done if the pres - ent political status quo is to be usefully maintained as against the alternative of dismemberment and division into tariff-walled dependencies .

		The vol - ume is well equipped with maps and statistical tables , and there is a capital portrait of the author , showing a sturdy , sailor-like figure standing with legs well apart as if braced against any sudden twist or capriole in the roll of the ship .

		Mr.
Leo Wiener	PERSON	's book on '' Yiddish Literature in the Nineteenth Cen - tury '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- deserves a welcome from a varied audience .

		Of the import of the book to those who themselves read or speak Yiddish , it is hardly necessary for us to say anything at all : they will perhaps appreciate its value rather more accurately than we .

		For we must confess ourselves ignorant of Yiddish , as are doubtless most of our readers .

		The name , of course , is not unfamiliar : further , the knowledge that the language is com - monly spoken in the Jewish colonies in our great cities , as well as abroad , may be fairly general .

		But any real appreciation of Yiddish literature , or even acquaintance with k , is rare among general readers .

		Yet it appears from Mr.
Wiener	PERSON	's his - torical sketch , and from the extracts which make up a good part of his book , that there is much that Themyiifry that it called is worth knowing about Those who have been interested in social problems have long been in the habit of considering the Jewish element among us : they will find in the account of this literature much that should make this curious social fraction better understood .

		There are also those for whom the Jewish strain in literature and art has a special charm the strain of
Spinoza	ORGANIZATION	,
Heine	LOCATION	,
Disraeli	PERSON	, to speak of literature only ; and these will be glad to see what is the work in letters of the Jews who remain Jews , how far it has the quality and the spirit of those great men who seem to have out - stepped the boundaries of the chosen people .

		But further , and more particularly , there are many now who are eagerly on the lookout for a new literature .

		Think how many exotic sensations we have had in the
last decade Bulgarian	DATE	, Persian , Polish , `` Afro - American , '' Scandinavian , Russian , not to speak of the four more common polite languages .

		These tastes of the literature of peoples very different from ourselves have a peculiar quality .

		This Yid - dish has a pathetic charm , a quaint delicacy which is very rare , although it may not perhaps precisely belong to it The very strangeness , the half - mystery , stimulates the imagination and gives a peculiar beauty which may vanish as one learns the language better , leaving in its place a sounder appreciation .

		Mr.
Wiener	PERSON	gives a sketch of the history of the literature in the present century , sometimes rather dry on account of having to deal with commonplace material , sometimes most attractive and really crit - ical , as especially in his handling of
Perez	PERSON	and Abramowitsch .

		From the examples of Yiddish with English translations it appears that the language is -LRB- naturally -RRB- not very difficult to the reader of Ger - man , though it can not be very easy to learn well without more help .

		Mr.
Wiener	PERSON	says that if the present work arouses interest he will undertake a more complete Chrestomathy : we think many be - sides ourselves would welcome such a book .

		We may add , for the benefit of those whose interest in Jewish literature is aroused by Mr.
Wiener	PERSON	's book , that a short history is just published in '' Chapters on Jewish Literature '' by
Israel Abrahams	PERSON	-LRB-
Jewish Publication Society	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		In short compass and in a popular way the author considers the literature of the Jewish people from the fall of
Jerusalem	LOCATION	till the time of
Moses Mendelssohn	PERSON	, about the period at which Mr.
Wiener	PERSON	's book begins .

		It is now some years since accounts appeared in the papers of the remark - able case concerning Mr.
Whistler	PERSON	's ''
Brown	PERSON	and Gold : Portrait of Lady E. , '' and we have now Mr.
Whistler	PERSON	's presentation of the mat - ter . ''

		The Baronet and the Butterfly : A
Valen	PERSON	- tine with a Verdict '' -LRB-
Russell	PERSON	-RRB- is a very curious work , not so clever as '' The Gentle Art of Making Enemies '' -LRB- for there is not so much really by Mr.
Whistler	PERSON	himself -RRB- but still very suggestive .

		THE DIAL 133 them , while Mr.
Whistler	PERSON	wished '' to expose pub - licly the ungrateful trickster , '' and did so .

		Nor do we attach very great importance to the alleged es - tablishment of certain advances in the sacred cause of Art against the
Philistines	LOCATION	.

		Our interest in the book comes largely from the light , or rather dark - ness , that it throws on the character of Mr.
Whistler	PERSON	.

		Whether Sir
William Eden	PERSON	deserves all the names he is here called , is not a matter to disturb us , and the sacred cause of Art does not seem to call for special championship at this moment ; but the genius of Mr.
Whistler	PERSON	is something worth knowing as thoroughly as we can .

		So far as his power as a painter is concerned , it is now by very many greatly appreciated .

		But here comes the curious question : How can a man whose mood as a painter has so much of exquisiteness , of reserve , of dignity , of power -LRB- not to mention peculiarly artistic qualities -RRB- , how can such a man conceive the nervously clever quips and the labored pettinesses that we see in Mr.
Whistler	PERSON	's letters and comments ?

		This has always appeared very strange to us .

		We have often found it hard to sympathize with Mr.
Whistler	PERSON	in the fundamental right of his position , because of the eccentric temper in which he maintains it .

		We do not want to hold a ridiculous and conventional opinion of what the character of an artist should be , but we are jarred by such incongruity of ex - pression in a man whose work has such a claim upon one as Mr.
Whistler	PERSON	's has .

		Is it only through the chance of time that we do not have evidence of the same thing in his friend Velasquez ?

		Or is it that our time has really developed genius to '' a disease of the nerves '' ?

		Perhaps rather the last .

		Somebody , we believe , suggests that Mr.
Whistler	PERSON	the artist can only exist by virtue of the purging ebullitions of Mr.
Whistler	PERSON	the humorist .

		It may be so .

		We have nothing better to suggest : we can merely look forward with interest to a sympathetic life of Mr.
Whistler	PERSON	by somebody else .

		Miss
Rose G. Kingsley	PERSON	's '' A History of French Art : 1100-1899 '' -LRB- Long - ^ ^ mans -RRB- is a concise , authoritative manual prepared for the use of those in quest of solid information , and therefore issued without the popular bait of pictorial allurements .

		The sober and solid make-up of this handsomely printed vol - ume does not belie its content .

		The author is officier de ^ instruction publique , and the work was prepared at the instance and with the assistance of
M. Antonin Barthele	ORGANIZATION	` my .

		Other well known French authorities have also aided in its preparation , and we have as a result a really sound and trustworthy account of the growth of French architecture , sculp - ture , and painting from the
12th century	DATE	to the present day .

		The author has been somewhat chary , judiciously so perhaps , in the matter of obtruding her own views and personality , though the element of general criticism or disquisition is not altogether lacking .

		Actual information and impartial charac - terization has been the ideal of attainment ; and the A concise manual of French Art .

		result is a guide to the history , development , and manifestations of French art during the extended period treated , which we cordially recommend to serious inquirers .

		A useful modicum of biographical and personal matter forms an agreeable leaven , and characteristic masterpieces are soberly and discrim - inatingly described .

		The work , despite its wide chronological range , is far from being a mere cata - logue raisonnS .

		The author gives a very good ac - count of '' Impressionism , '' which movement , she takes occasion to say , '' has too often signified the daubings of some young person ignorant of the very first principles of drawing or painting , who dares to call himself an ' Impressionist ' because he is too lazy or impatient to submit to the ceaseless training and study that are necessary to the artist ; too igno - rant to use his brush or his pencil , and takes to a palette-knife instead .

		It is such as these who bring discredit on the really fine artists whom they pre - tend to admire . ''

		These are just words , if severe ones ; and it is really a pity that the affectations and absurdities of these young daubers who cloak their incapacity and their ignorance of the rudiments of technique under the pretense of `` Impressionism , '' should have brought a certain stigma upon the term that is used to define the methods of masters like
Monet	ORGANIZATION	,
Besnard	LOCATION	,
Manet	LOCATION	, or
Renoir	ORGANIZATION	.

James Home	PERSON	.

		Lady
Stuart	PERSON	was a daughter of
John	PERSON	, third
Earl of Bute	PERSON	, one of
George Third	ORGANIZATION	's Prime Ministers ; and the picture she paints of some of the personages prominent at the court of that monarch are racy , amusing , and at times slightly malicious especially where the sitter chances to be of the writer 's own pex .

		Lady
Stuart	PERSON	was born in
1757	DATE	, and died in
1851	DATE	.

		Her tastes were literary , and she had the knack of ex - pression ; but she was deterred from publishing by the fact that it was then thought beneath the dig - nity of people '' of quality '' to appear in print , like common Grub Street bodies .


Tempora	ORGANIZATION	moresque mutantur .

		Nowadays '' the quality '' not only writes for print , but eke publishes ; and had Lady
Stuart	PERSON	lived to-day she might , without forfeiture of caste , have joined the craft of
Johnson	PERSON	to that of Cave .

		The story of the descensus of the British Aristocracy from the pinnacle of patronship to the depths of authorship might be worth writing .

		One regrets that Lady Stuart could not have foreseen the day -LRB- now with us -RRB- when a great lady could , with the applause of her order , issue a magazine , and angle , through the advertiser 's arts , for the shillings of the public in support of her venture .

		Once , indeed ,
Lady Stuart	PERSON	did appear formally in print , over her own patrician signature to wit , in an Introduction to a life of her grandmother , Lady
Mary Wortley Montagu	PERSON	, some share of whose ability she seems to us to have inherited .

		In fine , Lady

		neat little volume forming the Second Series of Mr.
Francis Watt	PERSON	's Lane -RRB- differs from its predecessor in that its con - tents are of more general interest , and are treated with greater fulness of detail and in a style more suited to the entertainment of the lay reader .

		The contents comprise seven brief papers which serve to illustrate the old English law and its ways , and incidentally to make the reader feel how much bet - ter these matters are ordered nowadays how much more rationally , humanely , and scientifically .

		Gro - tesqueness and barbarity , the principle of the ven - geance of society on the criminal -LRB- rather than the preventive theory -RRB- , so amply and shockingly in - stanced in Mr. New 's pages , have pretty thoroughly departed from English law .

		Gone are the days when executions were public -LRB- and terribly fre - quent -RRB- spectacles to which people flocked as to the

Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's Rus - sian campaign from the point of view of the com - mon soldier .

		M. de Se * gur has given us the narrative of the staff officer ; in
Bourgogne	LOCATION	's pages we read the coarser and more harrowing side of the story .

		Seldom have the horrors of war been depicted by a more literal and unaffected pen .

		In no previous record , we think , of this mad enterprise has the utter demoralization of the invading army , its grad - ual dissolution into a broken and fleeing horde of disorganized stragglers , been so impressively real - ized .

		Bourgogne 's personal adventures , while plainly and artlessly told , were most dramatic .

		The editor ,
M. Paul Cottin	PERSON	, provides an interesting sketch of the author , and there are a number of illustrations after drawings made by an officer dur - ing the retreat .

		It is not exactly a story for the young per - son , but this warning need hardly be sounded for those who are likely to be attracted by the present notice .

		The versatile Mr.
Grant Allen	PERSON	has been recently en - gaged , among other occupations , in the preparation of a series of historical guides to the chief European cities and countries .

		As a sort of complement to these manuals he has also prepared an outline volume entitled `` The European Tour '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- , which we heartily rec - ommend to travellers -LRB- whether for a year or a month -RRB- because it provides them with a rational plan of seeing
Europe	LOCATION	, and gaining the right sort of culture from their wanderings .

		Mr.
Allen	PERSON	is so breezy a writer that his companionship upon such a trip is of the pleasantest sort , and bis advice -LRB- although touched by a dah of Philistinism -RRB- is generally judicious and worth taking .

		Messrs.
Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	have collected into a single handsome volume the poems of Mr.
William Allen Butler	PERSON	, who is best known as the author of '' Nothing to Wear . ''

		This poem was published without a signa - ture in one of the early numbers of ''
Harper	PERSON	's Weekly , '' in
1857	DATE	, and speedily became popular .

		Mr.
Butler	PERSON	's verses , to which this authorized final form has just been given , include '' Oberannnergau '' and other travel pieces , some poems for children , and a number of trans - lations from
Uhlaud	LOCATION	.

		The volume is dedicated to the writer 's wife , '' in the fiftieth year of our wedded life . ''

		LITERARY NOTES .

		193 BOOKS OF THE COMING YEAR .

		The classified list of forthcoming publica - tions , which is , as in previous years , the dis - tinctive feature of this mid-September issue of THE DIAL , excites so many pleasurable antici - pations that the most careful selection from the announcements made can hardly fail to be somewhat invidious .

		As is stated in the note which heads the list , there are upwards of six - teen hundred titles already at hand , which is not only an increase , but a notably large in - crease , over any list previously published by us .

		Out of this wilderness of books of all sorts of interest we select , with considerable hesitation , a few of those that seem most at - tractive , confining the selection mainly to the departments of general literature , belles-lettres , history , and biography , although a few books from other categories are also included .

		Among works of general literature we are particularly glad to notice that the `` American Anthology , '' upon which Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	has for several years been engaged , is at last about to appear .

		Colonel
T. W. Higginson	PERSON	will pub - lish a volume of reminiscences under the title of '' Contemporaries . ''

		Professor
C. E. Norton	PERSON	has edited a new volume of the correspondence of
Ralph Waldo Emerson	PERSON	.

		A volume of the prose of
E. R. Sill	ORGANIZATION	will prove a welcome com - panion to the three volumes of his verse already published .

		A volume of the letters of
Sidney Lanier	PERSON	will be an extremely acceptable addi - tion to the list of the writings of a man whose fame grows yearly more secure . ''

		The Authority of Criticism and Other Essays , '' by Professor
W. P. Trent	PERSON	, will , we are sure , find many appreciative readers .

		Volumes of essays by Professor
John Fiske	PERSON	and Professor
H. T. Peck	PERSON	, those exceptionally versatile wri - ters , are also to appear .

		There will be sev - eral volumes in the new series of '' National Studies in American Letters , '' edited by Pro- fessor
G. E. Woodberry	PERSON	, whose own contribu - tion , '' Flower of Essex , '' will be awaited quite as eagerly as any of the others .

		We are glad , too , that an enlarged issue is promised of the selected essays of the late
Richard Malcolm Johnston	PERSON	.

		Outside of American general literature , 164 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, the most promising announcements are those of the letters of
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	and the long-heralded memoirs of
Victor Hugo	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	's Life and Letters of
John Donne	PERSON	has been heralded even longer , and will be one of the '' books of the year . ''

		The '' Rus - sian Literature '' by Mr.
K. Waliszewski	PERSON	will be added to Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	's series of '' Literature of the World . ''

		Dr.
Richard Garnett	PERSON	's Es - says in Librariauship and Bibliography '' will appeal to all bookmen .

		The host of reprints and artistic new editions of standard litera - ture is so great that we hesitate to select from them , but must make a single exception in favor of Mr.
Mosher	PERSON	's list , which is quite as attractive as ever , and includes sixteen titles , among them Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's first series of '' Poems and Balads , '' his '' Under the Micro - scope , '' Mr.
Mat-kail	PERSON	's translation of the `` Georgics , ''
Rossetti	PERSON	's '' Hand and Soul , '' and
Stevenson	PERSON	's `` A Child 's Garden of Verses . ''

		Among the important biographies of the year will be Mr.
Marion Crawford	PERSON	's life of the Pope , the two-volume life of
John Everett Millais	PERSON	, Mr.
L. R. Hartley	PERSON	's life of
Francis Lieber	PERSON	, Mrs.
Julia Ward Howe	PERSON	's '' Reminis - cences , '' Prince
Kropotkin	PERSON	's autobiography more fascinating than nine novels out of ten , as readers of '' The Atlantic Monthly '' already know , a life of
Charles Sumner	PERSON	by Mr.
MODI	PERSON	lie Id Story , Mrs.
John Drew	PERSON	's rem - iniscences , Mr.
Frederick Bancroft	PERSON	's life of
William II	PERSON	.

		Seward , President
Gilman	PERSON	's life of
James D. Dana	PERSON	, Mr.
Paul L. Ford	PERSON	's '' The Many-Sided Franklin , '' and Mr.
John Sar	PERSON	- tain 's '' Reminiscences of a Very Old Man . ''

		The various biographical series are going merrily along , and one or two promising new ones are projected .

		The literature of
American History	ORGANIZATION	will be notably enriched by new volumes of such standard works as those of Professor McM as - ter , Professor
John Fiske	PERSON	, Mr.
James Scbouler	PERSON	, and Mr.
J. F. Rhodes	PERSON	.

		A political history of '' The
United Kingdom	LOCATION	, '' by Professor Gold -
win Smith	PERSON	, is sure to be at once weighty and readable .

		A new field of description is en - tered upon by Dr.
Lyman P. Powell	PERSON	, who has edited an important work upon the '' Historic Towns of the
Middle States	LOCATION	. ''

		The edition of
Monroe	ORGANIZATION	's writings will be continued , and an edition started of the writings of
Madison	LOCATION	, the latter edited by Mr.
Gaillard Hunt	PERSON	.

		The most interesting announcements of poetry are of volumes by Mrs.
Louise Chandler Moulton	PERSON	,
Miss Louise Imogen Guiney	PERSON	, and Professor
G. E. Woodberry	PERSON	.

		But poets seem to be few in number this year , or else unusually modest in putting forth an advance claim to attention .

		We find no American announce - ment of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's u Rosamund , '' but that work will , of course , be the '' book of the year '' as far as poetry is concerned .

		We have also seen reports in our English exchange a probable volume of miscellaneous poems by Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	, as well as of the tragedy defi - nitely promised .

		We may well pause for breath before at - tempting to select , even for this briefest of men - tion , a score or more of the novels that seem to promise the most satisfaction .

		In American fiction we note the following : `` Janice Mere - dith , '' by Mr.
Paul L. Ford	PERSON	; '' Via Crucis , '' by Mr.
Marion Crawford	PERSON	; '' To Have and to Hold , '' by Miss
Mary Johnston	PERSON	; '' Their Silver Wedding Journey , '' by Mr.
W. D. Howells	PERSON	: `` The Last Rebel , '' by Mr.
Joseph Altsheler	PERSON	; and new volumes of short stories by Mr.
Bret Harte	PERSON	, Mr.
Richard Harding Davis	PERSON	, and the late
Blanche Willis Howard	PERSON	.

		In English fic - tion we are to have '' The King 's Mirror , '' by `` Anthony Hope '' ; `` The Orange Girl , '' by Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	; `` Siren City , '' by ''
Benja	PERSON	- min Swift '' ; `` lone
March	DATE	, '' by Mr.
S. K. Crockett	PERSON	; ''
Stalky & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
Rudyard Kipling	PERSON	; `` The Ship of Stars , '' by Mr.
A. T. Quiller-Couch	PERSON	; `` A White Dove , '' by Mr.
W. J. Locke	PERSON	; and `` Heronford , '' by Mr.
S. R. Keightley	PERSON	.

		We suppose that ''
Maarten Maar	PERSON	- tens '' may be considered sufficiently English to warrant the mention of '' Some Women I Have Known '' in this list .

		In translations of
Continental	ORGANIZATION	fiction , six works of the first im - portance may be underscored .

		They are the '' Knights of the Cross , '' by Mr.
Sienkiewicz	PERSON	; '' Resurrection , '' by Count Tolstoy ; '' Fruitful - ness , '' by
M. Zola	PERSON	; '' The White Terror , '' by
M. Felix Gras	PERSON	; `` The Poor Plutocrats , '' by Mr.
Jokai	PERSON	; and ''
Saragossa	LOCATION	, '' by Sf nor
Galdos	PERSON	.

		These are new works , with the exception of Mr.
Jokai	PERSON	's romance , which has long been a Hungarian classic .

		Returning now to works of scholarship , we find space to mention only a few of the more promising announcements .

		Mr.
Edward Fitz	PERSON	- gerald 's `` The Highest Andes '' and Mr.
Charles Neuf	PERSON	eld 's `` A Prisoner of the Khaleefa '' are perhaps the most important works of travel and adventure .

		Among works of art , we note a great work on Rubens , by
M. Emile Michel	PERSON	, an `` Iconografia Dantesca , '' by
Herr L. Volk	PERSON	- mann , and a new series of `` Handbooks of the
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 165
Great Masters	ORGANIZATION	in Painting and Sculpture , '' edited by Mr.
G. C. Williamson	PERSON	.

		In science one important announcement is that of `` Ap - pletons ' Geographical Series , '' edited by Mr.
J. H. Mackinder	PERSON	, and another is the ''
Cyclo	PERSON	- pedia of American Horticulture , '' edited by Mr.
L. H. Bailey	PERSON	.

		Finally , among works of social science we are promised `` Democracy and Empire , '' by Professor
F. H. Giddings	PERSON	, `` The Distribution of Wealth , '' by Professor
John B.Clark	PERSON	, '' The Principles of Taxation , '' by the late
D. A. Wells	PERSON	, and the third and concluding volume of Professor
Palgrave	PERSON	's '' Dictionary of Political Economy , '' which has been greatly desired for several years .

		LITERATURE , MUSIC , AND MORALS .

		The ever-enduring discussion as to whether a book may picture evil , may paint scenes and char - acters not usually brought to the notice of women and children , and the somewhat similar battles over dancing Bacchantes and nude French art , raise a question as to why music is so seldom involved in such controversies .

		`` Why is it that literature is by some regarded as a regular Upas plant , and a circulating library in a town as '' an evergreen tree of diabol - ical knowledge , '' while music is suffered to go on its way serenely without any indictment for crim - inal conversation or corrupting ways ?

		At first blush , the art which has the most power - ful momentary effect on our passions and emotions , which is used to incite men to martial ardor or sub - due them to sensuous reverie , which in its simplest and most popular forms the Soldier 's
March	DATE	in
Faust	LOCATION	, or a Strauss waltz is as effective as in the heroic Symphony of Beethoven or the
Nocturnes of Chopin	ORGANIZATION	, at first sight , it would seem that such an art could be most easily misused and most read - ily accused of wrong-doing .

		But such is not the case .

		Nobody except a Nietsche or a
Tolstoi	LOCATION	has ever accused any form of music divorced from words or action of being immoral .

		The young girl all over the world is not only allowed but encouraged and compelled to busy herself with music , which , if it expresses anything , must express things dangerous as well as things innocent .

		At the same time , the forbidden fruit of the knowledge of literature is carefully kept from her or selected for her .

		Why this difference ?

		It is against the principles of a true American to go to a German philosopher for an explanation of anything , but perhaps
Schopenhauer	PERSON	's metaphysic and theory of art will help us here .

		In brief , this is how he decides matters : The primal thing , the origin of all , is the Will the Will to live .

		This Will arranges itself into many grades , similar to the Platonic Ideas , which are the types and genera of existing realities .

		These ideas again objectify themselves simultaneously in the world of particu - lars and individuals , which is the object , and in the knowing mind , which is the subject .

		The majority of human beings can only realize themselves and the outward world of sense and perception .

		The genius in the sphere of literature and the fine arts generally does more than this .

		He rises to a knowl - edge of the architypal ideas , and sees the universal in the particular ; and he is able to make the rest of mankind dimly sympathize with him .

		The mu - sician , however , can not do this .

		For him , neither the world of sense perception nor that of the prim - itive Ideas exists .

		He does not imitate the first , as other artists do , nor does he arrange his forms according to the grades and divisions of the last .

		The primal Will speaks through him directly , and every human being in whom the Will exists in its unity and totality feels and understands him with - out being able to reason about or explain the mat - ter .

		It follows that the poet who has to deal with the world of sense , in which there is as much evil as good , as much night as day , must , if he give his world correctly , indulge largely in the shadows of existence ; while the musician , freed from such world , only gives us the primal impulse of life , which we do not consciously disintegrate into good or bad .

		This is very flattering to the writer of music .

		Artists are envious , and the exquisite footing of the first act of the Bourgeois Gentilhomme mildly typ - ifies the cat-and-dog aversion which the members of the various liberal arts have for each other .

		Nor are the leading arts of expression the only ones that quarrel for precedence .

		The ancients elevated per - fumes almost to the level of poetry , and
M. Alcide	PERSON	de Mirobolant wooed his love with symbolic sauces and confections , and considered himself a gentle - man and an artist .

		In short , it is doubtful if Scho - penhauer 's theory will be widely accepted .

		For one thing , he calls music the universal lan - guage .

		If it be , it is a language which has not yet found its Ollendorf .

		The musical theorist of to-day decides , for example , that Greek music was non - existent .

		Yet this race , certainly not a stupid one , evidently thought they had attained to complete musical expression .

		Their literature is full of ref - erences to the art , and a great number of their deities were dedicated to the protection and per - formance of it .

		They unquestionably had a varied assortment of musical instruments , though not so many as their predecessors , the Egyptians .

		Whole orchestras are depicted on the Egyptian tombs , yet the modern musician will probably deny their knowl - edge of music .

		Again , Chinese music exists and gives pleasure to a large part of the human race , yet to our ears it seems barbarous dissonance .

		But the quarrel of European musicians among them - selves the battle of Wagnerites and anti-Wag - nerites is sufficient to plant in the ordinary mind a doubt of
Schopenhauer	PERSON	's theory as to music being the immediate and direct utterance of the universal 166 TIIK DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, Will .

		Schopenhauer himself says that where music is fitted to action or words , these should be subor - dinated to it ; which is the direct contrary of Wag - ner 's theory and practice of interpreting actions by music .

		If there exists a universal language , it is a simpler one than music it is the language of gesture and human motion : in other words , the dance .

		This is , and always has been , practiced and understood .

		If a man is shipwrecked on a desert island , and comes into company of its savage and possibly can - nibal inhabitants , how does he go about to make himself understood ?

		Does he troll a stave or sing a long recitative with the leit-motif dedicated to hunger reappearing at intervals ?

		No .

		He kneels down in token of submission makes motions with his hands to his mouth and stomach to show his needs : and if he is received and regaled treated not as a meat but as a guest he probably skips about in a lively manner to indicate pleasure and gratitude .

		It is curious to remark that
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's Paradise the farthest reach of the human imag - ination in picturing the unknown is a soundless world .

		There are no harps or citherns or orchestras there .

		There is nothing but light , dancing , and philosophical discourses .

		Critics there have been who thought it grotesque ; and unquestionably the spectacle of grave Doctors of the Church gyrating on one toe , or wheeling three times about
Dante	PERSON	and his guide , or flocking together like cranes and writing out symbolical letters on the sky , might make a thoughtless reader smile .

		But philosoph - ically speaking ,
Dante	PERSON	was quite right .

		If we sub > titute motion for Will as the primal thing which , as
Schopenhauer	PERSON	refuses to explain the cause of Will and even denies that it has any cause , is a legitimate thing to do we get a some - what different relation of the arts to life .

		Three of the fine arts dancing , music , and poetry are founded on motion .

		For sound is probably only an accident of music , its real essence is the differ - ently measured and related waves of motion .

		Bee - thoven was deaf , but that did not interfere with his creative power , nor , presumably , with his enjoyment of music .

		Architecture is the reverse of motion it expresses rest , static immobility , and is best ex - emplified in Egyptian and Greek buildings .

		Gothic architecture is an attempt to revolt from the law of the art , and to express , by means of the heaviest materials in nature , aspiration and upward flight .

		It is as if a sculptor should carve a statue of
Gravi	LOCATION	- tation and give it wings .

		Sculpture is the arrest of motion .

		Painting is at its best when it gives the vitality of life , and the scene or figure grows and acts before one .

		Dancing is motion with forms added .

		Poetry is motion with forms and ideas added .

		Music is motion without either forms or ideas pureunembodied motion .

		Whether this last method of expression is superior to poetry , which gives in its characters and ideas the whole of the world of sense and in its rhythm the whole of the world of Will , everybody will decide according to previous predilection .

		Roughly speaking , I should say that poetry is an aristocratic and music a democratic art .

		It requires intellect to appreciate the one ; while emotion , pas - sion , the Will-to-live , suffice for the enjoyment of the other .

		Like the Darwinian science ,
Schopen	PERSON	- hauer 's philosophy dethrones the conscious intellect and substitutes the blind and spontaneous forces of nature .

		Yet no one has more loudly and continu - ously celebrated intellect .

		He is like a man whose head is twisted on his shoulders and who marches in one direction while his gaze is mournfully fixed another way .

		The essential and cherubic innocence of music comes out in this exposition .

		It has no relation to morals , for things are good or bad as we attach ideas to them .

		Its world is a world of pure impulse , impetus , and agitation .

		There can be bad music , of course , music hackneyed , or which does not con - form to the laws of the art .

		But it must be diffi - cult for true music to be base or vulgar .

		It is understood that many of the most popular strains of comic opera have been taken almost bodily from old church music ; and the reverse is possible .

		The stormiest and most passionate music , then , music , which , for aught we know , may be the utterance of the soul of one of the damned , can be given to a young girl to interpret without danger of its con - taminating her .

		But how does poetry stand in this respect ?

		It has in its rhythm , though of course less peifectly than music , the essence of motion , pure , unembodied , and divine .

		But it is compelled to give also motion which is embodied in nature motion beautiful , life-giving , turbulent , desolating , and destroying .

		It has to give the same motion as it is repeated in the mind of man happy , serene , disturbed , wrath - ful , death-dealing .

		Nay , as the desolating elements and forms of nature fire , storm , earthquake are the most startling and instantaneous , as the bad motives and actions of men yield themselves most readily to effect and climax , so literature chooses to deal largely with evil .

		For it loves energy mo - tion in its intensest forms .

		It would be actionable if a newspaper were to give in plain prose the plots of many of the greatest masterpieces of literary art .

		Dr.
Quincey	PERSON	did something like this drew up a resumS of Goethe 's ''
Wilhelm Meister	PERSON	'' and the bare facts were ludicrous and immoral enough .

		But the book does not seem ludicrous and immoral when we yield ourselves to its energy and its flow .


Cardinal Newman	PERSON	, in his book on The Idea of a
University	ORGANIZATION	, '' came to this cross-roads .

		He * aw that the profane literature of the world , and particularly that of the ancients , dealt overwhelmingly with evil .

		Was it , therefore , to be taught to the Htudents of a Catholic university ?

		He decided that it must : that it could not hurt anyone to read in a book what he must know if he takes a stroll on the HtreeU or lis - tens to the gossip of a club .

		Human nature is robust
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 167 enough not to be shocked at itself .

		And human nature translated into the terms of good literature given , that is , for the sake of the energy and power of which it is capable , and not to pander to base thoughts , ought not to shock anyone ; but on the contrary , especially when it adds to the rhythm of poetry that unexplainable motion sprung we know not whence it ought to charm the tedium of life and leave us greater and better than we were .

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		THE CIVIL WAR AND NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The review of the work by Mr.
Egan	PERSON	and myself on '' The Commerce Clause of the
Federal Constitution	ORGANIZATION	, '' which Mr.
James O. Pierce	PERSON	contributed to the mid -
August	DATE	number of your paper , is in many ways grati - fying ; but I would like , if I can , to correct the impression that '' the authors advocate the theory that the
United States	LOCATION	did not become a Nation until made so by the results of the Civil War . ''

		The
Federal Constitution	ORGANIZATION	is essentially national in character , and nowhere does it show this character more strongly than in the
Commerce Clause	ORGANIZATION	itself .

		Time aud experience of the new government were re - quired , however , to complete the work of making a
Nation	ORGANIZATION	in fact of that which the Constitution had made a
Nation	ORGANIZATION	in law .

		In
Chisholm v. Georgia	ORGANIZATION	, decided in
1793	DATE	, the case to which Mr.
Pierce	PERSON	refers , five judges rendered individ - ual opinions .

		No opinion was rendered on behalf of the court , but expressions were used which indicated that a majority of the justices considered that the
Fed	ORGANIZATION	- eral government was national in character .

		The case was , however , followed in
1799	DATE	by the
Virginia	LOCATION	and
Kentucky	LOCATION	resolutions announcing views of the Consti - tution which are absolutely inconsistent with any actual national sovereignty , and which nevertheless have the support of the great names of Madison and
Jefferson	PERSON	.

		In
1823	DATE	the doctrine which was afterwards known by the name of '' Nullification '' was presented to Mr.
Justice Johnson	PERSON	, and subsequently , in
1824	DATE	, was elab - orately argued before
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	in the case of
Gibbons v. Ogden	ORGANIZATION	.

		In both cases the element of na - tionality involved was , as we have noticed in our book , explicitly disclosed and asserted by the Federal Courts -LRB- '' Commerce Clause , '' page 16 ; -RRB- but in
1832	DATE	,
eight years later	DATE	, '' Nullification '' was still growing and in that year produced the famous Ordinance of
South Carolina	LOCATION	.

		It was the doctrine of
State	ORGANIZATION	's Rights which enabled Southern states to exclude free persons of color ; which in
1836	DATE	compelled the Postmaster Gen - eral of the
United States	LOCATION	, upon the demand of
State	ORGANIZATION	officials , to exclude anti-slavery publications from the mails ; which produced the dissensions in the
Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	in
New York	LOCATION	v. Miln -LRB- 1837 -RRB- the License Cases -LRB- 1847 -RRB- , and the Passenger Cases -LRB-
1848	DATE	-RRB- ; and which drew from Mr.
Justice Barbour	PERSON	and Mr.
Justice Grier	PERSON	the statement that the police power reserved to the States is itself '' complete , unqualified , and exclusive , '' so that
State	ORGANIZATION	regulations enacted under this power are superior to Federal statutes in authority .

		It is clear , therefore , that during the time when Southern influence was as strong at
Washington	LOCATION	and upon the bench of
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	as it was for many years before the war , the
Southern	ORGANIZATION	theories of construction had succeeded in depriving the Federal government of many national attributes .

		The influ - ence of the doctrine of
State	ORGANIZATION	's Rights , as we say in our work , '' may be seen throughout the course of decisions of
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	before the Civil War , and al - though it had the distinct disapproval of that court , it was a doctrine which no decision could overthrow . ''

		-LRB- '' Commerce Clause , '' page 37 -RRB- .

		The war did not change the Constitution , but gave it for the first time full operation .

		It is in this respect that the '' issue of the Civil War finally established on a new basis the re - lations between the States and the Federal govern - ment . ''

		Whatever their legal relations had been before the war , they were certainly not established in fact as they were afterward .

		The decision in
Craudall	LOCATION	v. Ne - vada established , in
1867	DATE	, the right of free movement between all points within the national boundary ; but a greater change could hardly have been made , for until then no such right had in fact existed .

		The right to go from
Massachusetts	LOCATION	to
South Carolina	LOCATION	, until the Civil War altered matters , depended in fact not upon Federal law but upon State law , that is , in these matters there seemed to be no national boundary , for the citizen of the
United States	LOCATION	knew only
State	ORGANIZATION	bound - aries .

		After the subject of slavery first arose '' like an alarm bell in the
night	TIME	, '' until the war disposed of se - cession , theories of disunion greatly influenced consti - tutional construction .

		State sovereignty was more thought of than national sovereignty .

		The government which began with the Constitution was not completely established as a national government until these ques - tions which dated from its commencement were at last settled , until the government which had so often been called national was given again the national powers of self-administration which had been taken from it , and the national theory of construction had been at last adopted by the whole people .

		`` BALDOON '' AND `` DAVID HARUM . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		As the publishers of Mr.
Le Roy Hooker	PERSON	's new book , ''
Baldoon	PERSON	, '' we think it desirable to correct an impres - sion , shared by a number of reviewers , that the work must have been written in imitation of Mr.
Westcott	PERSON	's ''
David Harum	PERSON	. ''

		Singularly enough , the first accusation came from a newspaper published in Mr.
Hooker	PERSON	's home city , the
Chicago	LOCATION	'' Times-Herald . ''

		Under the conspicuous head - line , ''
David Harum Imitated	PERSON	, '' that paper said in part : '' Such remarkable success has attended the publication of '
David Harum	PERSON	, ' that it is but natural for other au - thors to attempt to do something in the same line ... The reader -LSB- of '
Baldoon	PERSON	' J feels all the time as if the author is saying to himself , '
David Harum	PERSON	succeeded because it was a wonderful character sketch .

		Perhaps if I do full justice to all these peculiar people I have in mind I may catch the public with one of them . ' ''

		This was followed by a
Detroit	LOCATION	paper , which began its review with the remark , '' It was inevitable that we should have a story reminiscent of
David Harum	PERSON	, '' and added , '' It -LSB-

		The
August	DATE	number of the
Deutsche Rundschau	ORGANIZATION	con - tains a characteristic article on Goethe by Professor
Herman Grimm	PERSON	, son of one of the authors of the great
Grimm Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	and son-in-law of
Bettina von Arnim	PERSON	, who played a more or less important role in
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's life in
Weimar	LOCATION	.

		As showing Professor
Grimm	PERSON	's opinion of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's services to the German language , and of
Bismarck	PERSON	's debt to him , the following extract , trans - lated from this article , has a special interest in this year of Goethe celebrations : '' The German of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	will be the language of the new German Empire , just as the language of Homer was that of the Greek world , of which the Iliad and the Odyssey were the fir.st monuments , and the Gospel of John the last .

		How far the dominion of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's language may eventually extend , nobody knows .

		The first successor of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	is
Bismarck	LOCATION	as writer of his own life , a work that may he called the first German work of art written in the language of Goethe without showing a trace of imitation .

		Just as
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's ` Her - mann nnd
Dorothea	PERSON	' would not have been possible without Homer , so
Bismarck	PERSON	's ' Reminiscences and Reflections ' -LRB- Erinnerungen und Gedanken -RRB- would not be imaginable without
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	.

		Goethe created for
Germany	LOCATION	the atmosphere in which alone this fruit ripened . ''

MR. W. M. GRISWOLD	PERSON	, who died last month in
Maine	LOCATION	, his native State , at the age of forty-six , will be remembered gratefully by literary workers for his useful bibliographical work , which he prosecuted chiefly aider the queer pseudonym of `` Q. P. Index . ''

		His series of indexes include the '' North American Re - Tiew , '' `` The Nation , '' ''
Lippincott	PERSON	's Magazine , '' the elder '' Scnbner , '' the '' Eclectic , '' ''
Harper	PERSON	's Weekly , '' some British and some German historical magazines , essays , etc. , and a series of '' Q. P. Annuals . ''

		His Descriptive Lists of Novels were also valuable .

		He was a man of eccentricities , and these marred some - what the mechanical form of his publications , and may partly explain why he was always his own publisher .

		Mr.
Griswold	PERSON	was a graduate of
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	in
1875	DATE	.

		He was the son of the better known
Rufua W. Gris	PERSON	- wold , whose attacks upon
Poe	PERSON	in his '' Poets and Poetry of
America	LOCATION	'' have occasioned no little controversy ; and bis last work , published about a year ago , was a sort of vindication of his father from criticisms which this controversy entailed .

		iThe 1 : U -RRB- `` AMERICAN TAL.K8 '' BY VETERAN .

		* Few critics , we fancy , are likely even in this time of the cult of the newest and latest , when the idol of the day before yesterday finds himself not uncommonly the despised '' back number '' of to-day to hint that that im - memorial veteran of American letters , '' Ik Marvel , '' lags superfluous on the stage upon which he made his debut over half a cen - tury ago . ''

		Ik Marvel '' is a trusty perennial whose recurrent blossoming gladdens the sea - son .

		THE DIAL 169 in a vein of intrinsic grace and charm that even the most '' contemporaneous '' - minded of the generation whose spokesman is Kipling may well relish .

		Not that '' Ik Marvel '' has kept pace with the changing fashion of style -LRB- what a far cry it is in this regard from , for example ,
N. P. Willis	PERSON	to the author of '' Plain Tales from the Hills '' ! -RRB-

		, or that he has , out of def - erence to the mode , divested his thought of the somewhat dandified garb in vogue at the period to which he looks back .

		He is still ''
Ik Marvel	PERSON	, '' as the following passage , an ex - treme example , of course , may serve to indicate . ''

		There are descriptions of Parisian dinners in his -LCB-
John Sanderson	PERSON	's -RRB- ' American in
Paris	LOCATION	' which fairly scintillate with provocatives of appetite and with con - stellations of cookery ; all the more tempting was his talk of Apician delicacies , since it was broidered and savored by abounding Latinity and by pungent Roman flavors swirling down on classic tides from the days of Lucnllus . ''

		Mr.
Mitchell	PERSON	writes interestingly of Emer - son , and thus discerningly points out the source of the insufficiency , as biography , of
Holmes	PERSON	's pleasant Life of the
Concord	LOCATION	sage : '' ... A lithe and witty Montaigne can not meas - ure for us a broad-shouldered Plato ; he is too much and too buoyantly himself to write the life of another .

		Scarce does the pleasant doctor begin his delightful task , but his own piquant flavors , queries , and humor bubble up through all the chinks of the story and make us forget the subject in the narrator .

		A man who is so used to drawing attention to his own end of the table , can not serve safely as a pointer at someone else . ''

		Of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's '' aloofness '' Mr.
Mitchell	PERSON	goes on to say , apropos of the Rev.
Henry James	PERSON	's com - plaint of '' his prim and bloodless friendship '' : '' ... But
James	PERSON	with the warmth of the
New Jerusalem	ORGANIZATION	' in him craved sympathetic speech in those who talked theologies with him a most acute , eager man with transcendental ranges of thought .

		The estimate agrees with that of many ; few could get near Emer - son ; the
Marchioness Ossoli	PERSON	never ;
Hawthorne	PERSON	never ; James never ; an implacable acquiescence closes the doors between him and very many earnest talkers ... About the weather , or his neighbor 's pigs , or
Thoreau	PERSON	's bean-patch , he could warm ; but if one dropped such topics for talk about the soul , or immortality , he froze ; on such trail his thought was too intense for any bat - tledore and shuttlecock ' interchange of phrase . ''

		Not so
Alcott	PERSON	, who , on the slightest hint from his unwary interlocutor as to the '' soul , or immortality , '' would go on , like
Tennyson	PERSON	's brook , forever or at least till the dazed dis - ciple or victim broke away and fled , leaving the button in the grasp of the still expounding oracle .

		Emerson , it is true , spoke of
Bronson Alcott	PERSON	as '' a most extraordinary man , and the highest genius of his time . ''

		But does Mr.
Mitchell	PERSON	remember the story of the window , at the rear of the
Emerson	LOCATION	house , which the artless cicerone of the place used not long ago to point out to visitors as `` the one through which Mr.
Emerson	PERSON	used to escape when he saw Mr.
Alcott	PERSON	coming down the garden path ? ''

		We suspect not ; for he tells us , without reservation : '' The sobrieties and the large dignities in which the Orphic philosopher wrapped even his shallowest speech , could not be otherwise than agreeable to the man -LSB-
Emerson	PERSON	-RSB- who had a horror of noise and bounce . ''

		The '' Orphic Sayings '' -LRB- would they find lodgment in a magazine nowadays ? -RRB-

		con - tributed to '' The Dial '' in Miss Fuller 's time , Mr.
Mitchell	PERSON	makes bold to say were '' rather mystical than profound , '' and '' most charac - teristic '' of the author . ''

		He delighted in forays into regions of the unknown with whatever timid or tentative steps and although he might have put a vehemence into his expression that would seem to imply that he was drifting into deep waters one can not forbear the conviction that ' t would be easy for this man of the explorative mentalities to touch ground with his feet -LRB- if he chose -RRB- in all the bays where he swims . ''

		Does Mr.
Mitchell	PERSON	mean to hint that the fathomless
Alcott	PERSON	, '' the highest genius of his time , '' deliberately feigned to swim where he might , had he chosen to be honest , have waded ankle-deep ?

		An accurate colloquial version of one of the '' Orphic Sayings '' might , then , prove in a way instructive .

		We remember a young acquaintance of ours once saying that a sentence of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's resembles a sentence of
Alcott	ORGANIZATION	's as an apple resembles a puff-ball .

		Mr.
Mitchell	PERSON	talks interestingly of the
Brook Farm	ORGANIZATION	experiment , and has some kind words for the earnest and high-minded ''
Archon	ORGANIZATION	'' of the little community ,
George Ripley	PERSON	.

		Ripley , it is interesting to know , was not altogether pleased with the ''
Blithedale Romance	ORGANIZATION	. '' ''

		Much as he enjoyed the genius of
Hawthorne	LOCATION	, I do not think he had kindly thought of the
Blithedale Romance	ORGANIZATION	' ; not , indeed , blind to its extraordinary merit , or counting it an ugly picture but as one throwing a quasi pagan glamour over a holy undertaking .

		I re - member once asking him in that dingy Tribune office after the religious tendencies , or utterances of Haw - thorne in those Brook Farm days ; he said , bluntly ` There were none no reverence in his nature . '

		Very likely he would have hesitated before putting such opinions in cold type .

		But I could see that old mem - ories were seething in his thought , of that large humane purpose into which he had put his heart , and whereon the great Romancer had put only his artist eye . ''

		Of the `` great Romancer , '' Mr.
Mitchell	PERSON	draws the following winning portrait : `` Mr.
Hawthorne	PERSON	was then -LRB- 1853 -RRB- nearing fifty strong , erect , broad-shouldered , alert his abundant hair touched with gray , his features all cast in Greek mould and his fine eyes full of searchingness , and yet 170 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, of kindliness ; his voice deep , with weighty resounding quality , as if bearing echoes of things unspoken ; no arrogance , no assurance even , but rather there hung about his manner and his speech a cloud of self-distrust , of mal-aise , as if he were on the defensive in respect of his own quietudes , and determined not to rest there .

		Withal , it was a winning shyness ; and when some - what later his jolly friend Ticknor tapped him on the shoulder , and told him bow some lad wanted to be pre - sented , there was something painful in the abashed manner with which the famous author awaited a school - boy 's homage cringing under such contact with con - ventional usage as a school-girl might . ''

		Mr.
Mitchell	PERSON	's chapter on Poe amounts al - most , as with several other of the more con - siderable authors in his list , to a brief biograph - ical sketch .

		A foot-note on Foe 's biographers briefly summarizes Mr.
Mitchell	PERSON	's estimates of their several accounts . ''

		Biographies : by
Griswold	ORGANIZATION	, harsh in its judgments ;
Ingram	LOCATION	, full , but over-defensive ;
Stoddard	PERSON	, wholly fair , not extended ;
Woodbury	LOCATION	, faithful , painstaking , cleverly done , but not wholly sympathetic ; the late Professor
Minto	PERSON	's sketch -LRB- British Encyclopaedia -RRB- , very misleading ; and
Lang	PERSON	's note in his piquant ' Letters to Dead Au - thors , ' has kindred misjudgments . ''

		While dealing charitably and with becoming reticence with Foe 's failings as a man , Mr.
Mitchell	PERSON	says : '' Whether by pre-natal influences or forces of educa - tion , the moral sense was never very strong in the poet ; nor was there in him any harrassing sense of the want of such a sense .

		He used a helpful untruth as freely and unrelentingly as a man straying in bog-land would put his foot upon a strong bit of ground which , for the time , held him above the mire . ''

		The death of Foe 's child-wife marked in his career , thinks the author , the beginning of an epoch of general degeneracy , the detailed story of which had better been left untold . ''

		We have hardly a right to regard what he did after this whether in the way of writing , of love-making , or of business projects as the work of a wholly re - sponsible creature . ''

		But the taint in Foe 's character is never mani - fest in his verse . ''

		Again , and in highest praise of this erratic genius , it must be said , that in bis pages even in the mag - ical renderings of Baudelaire there is no lewdness ; no beastly double-meanings ; not a line to pamper sen - sual appetites ; he is clear and cool as Arctic mornings . ''

		Mr.
Mitchell	PERSON	speaks in his preface of '' a great welter of provisionary notes , '' yet unused , touching
Motley	ORGANIZATION	,
Whipple	PERSON	,
Holland	LOCATION	, Dr. Par - sons ,
Melville	LOCATION	,
Tuckerman	PERSON	, the Duykincks , and others .

		We hope to see this budget of mem - oranda embodied in a third book of '' American Talks '' in the near future .

		The volume is at - tractively made throughout , the profuse and well-chosen illustrations forming a tempting feature .

		E. o. j. RELIGION IN GREEK LITERATURE .

		* The hopeless welter of uncoordinated fact and unverified hypothesis in which the study of Greek religion is losing itself is due to two causes .

		-LRB- 1 -RRB- The fundamental principles of the science are so involved with religious and philosophical prepossessions that it is vain to look for a reconciliation aud harmonizing of opposite schools in any generally accepted con - ception of the psychology of primitive man and the philosophy of prehistoric history .

		-LRB- 2 -RRB- The historical verification of the countless hypothe - ses thrown out by learned ingenuity is rarely possible owing to the gaps in our evidence , and even the attempt to win a clear oversight of the work accomplished is greatly embarrassed by the reluctance of scholars to admit any lim - its to the amount of information which plaus - ible speculation may extract from a defective record .

		In so comparatively simple a matter , for example , as the literary growth of Greek legend from Homer to
Pindar	ORGANIZATION	and the drama - tists , there is much that we shall never know for the plain reason that the literature is lost .

		But a little difficulty like that can not curb the soaring genius of a Wilamovitz-Moellendorf .

		He reconstructs an entire lost epic of Hesiod from three fragmentary lines , and a few no - tices in late mythological handbooks that may or may not be based on Hesiod . ''

		Das ist ein stuck Ewiger Poesie , '' he exclaims , in ecstatic contemplation of his handiwork ; and he confi - dently looks forward to the time when the '' pro- gress of investigation '' shall have thus '' recon - structed '' all the lost poets of
Greece	LOCATION	as a basis for the definitive study of Greek religion and mythology .

		But those of us who lack this robust faith in divinatory methods must be content to ask many questions to which we can hardly expect final answers .

		What is the relative weight and significance for early Greek religion of the various '' true courses '' indicated by the terms totem ism , tree worship , disease of language ; which is the more important factor , Aryan personification of nature , the misunderstanding of ritual prac - tices , or half-conscious poetical symbolism ?

		Are the earliest allusions in extant literature to a deity or a religious conception '' germs '' or '' interpolations '' ?

		What is the date of ori - gin and the significance of the religious mys - ticism associated with the name of Orpheus ?

		Which of the Greek cults and gods are autoch - RBUOIOM IK GREEK LITERATURE .

		THE DIAL 171 thonous or '' Pelasgic , '' and which came in from
Phrygia	LOCATION	, ^
Egypt	LOCATION	, or
Phoenicia	LOCATION	?

		Are the Ary - ans or the Semites in possession of the key to all Greek mythologies ?

		Are resemblances be - tween apparently disparate cults to be ex - plained as coincidences or as '' contaminations '' ?

		On what lines were the various cults diffused through
Greece	LOCATION	, from North to South or from East to West , by land or by sea ?

		To every one of these questions something in our frag - mentary evidence suggests a conceivable , some - times a plausible , answer .

		The '' investigator '' marshals an appalling erudition in the effort to convert these possibilities to certainties .

		His position is that of the coming
New Zealander	LOCATION	, if after two thousand years he finds himself confronted with about half of the best English poetry , and a miscellaneous collection of docu - ments recovered from the corner-stones of American churches , and attempts therewith to reconstruct not merely the general trend of religious and ethical thought in the
Nineteenth century	DATE	, but the local history of every Amer - ican sect and parish , and behind that the origin , diffusion , and history of Christianity in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		In this state of the science I am inclined to congratulate Professor
Campbell	PERSON	that his '' Re - ligion in Greek Literature '' a '' Sketch in Outline , '' as he modestly terms it is not an '' investigation , '' and will probably , like
Pater	PERSON	's admirable '' Plato and Platonism , '' be dismissed by the '' selten eischeinende Monatschrift '' with the remark , '' bringt nichts neues . ''

		It does not bring anything new in the way of bold original generalization and hypothesis , or even of patient gathering of hitherto uncollected fact .

		But the combination in Professor
Campbell	PERSON	of sobriety and sanity of judgment with sound and intimate knowledge of the religious thought of the great Greek writers , and a pleasant and read - able style these things will be new and very grateful to the amateur in these difficult matters .

		As his title implies , Professor
Campbell	PERSON	deals rather with the religious thought of
Greece	LOCATION	as reflected in the poets and philosophers than with picturesque superstitions and survivals , or the traditional cults and conventional half be - liefs of the multitude .

		In the technical science of religions he is , as his pretty Greek epigram avows , a late learner of a new-fangled wisdom .

		But he has a life-long familiarity with the best that was thought and said in
Greece	LOCATION	, and there are probably few specialists in Greek religion who could write as sanely , as comprehensively , and as sympathetically as he has done of the religion of
Herodotus	ORGANIZATION	,
Euripides	LOCATION	,
Socrates	LOCATION	, and
Plato	ORGANIZATION	.

		And it is well that scholars , in their preoccupation with detail , should be reminded that our primary concern in this matter is not the curiosities and the quaintnesses of folk-lore and popular religion , but the thought of the few supreme spirits of
Greece	LOCATION	: `` That few is all the world which with a few Doth ever live and move and work and strive . ''

		It may even be that the clear utterances of the few will tell us more of the serious and abiding beliefs of the many than we can learn from any literal catalogue of quaint practices and superstitious fancies nominally surviving among them .

		In Xeuophon 's '' Economist , ''
Ischo	PERSON	- machus instructs his child-wife in a gentle and wholesome form of Socratic natural religion .

		It may well be , as Professor
Campbell	PERSON	sensibly observes , that '' this glimpse of an Attic inte - rior , idealized though it may be , teaches us more about Attic religion than the information that the person thus instructed had danced the bear dance at ten years old , or had carried the bas - ket in honor of Athene at fifteen . ''

		And in another place he shows entertainingly what strange conceptions of the religious life of Scot - land might be conveyed by a travelling folk - lorist who should describe the rites of the local Bacchus ,
John Barleycorn	PERSON	, and enumerate vari - ous quaint observances alluded to by
Burns	PERSON	and still kept up , such as burning hazel-nuts on the hearth-stone , hanging out horse shoes as a pro- tection against the evil eye , making offerings at sacred wells to which the sick and infirm are brought for healing , touching cold iron after en - countering a pig , etc. .

		It will be a pity if the ana - logues of these things in
Greece	LOCATION	should obscure for us Homer and Plato and
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's four prophets of the imaginative reason , Pin - dar ,
Simonides	PERSON	,
Sophocles	LOCATION	, and JEschylus .

		Space fails to follow with Professor Camp - bell the process by which the naive but beau - tiful and wholesome anthropomorphism of Homer developed into the sublime monotheism -LRB- for this it virtually is -RRB- of the great religious odes of 2Eschylus and Sophocles .

		Nor can we pause to trace the parallel growth of ethical reflection whereby the prudential or political morality of Hesiod , Theognis , and the gnomic poets was transformed into the ideal and abso - lute ethics of Plato , perhaps the first European to affirm that God is not jealous , that punish - ment should never be vindictive , and that the good man will never harm even his enemy .

		The pages on
Socrates	LOCATION	, and the summing up on Euripides are especially good .

		These chapters were originally written for the Gifford lectureship on religion , to which Professor
Campbell	PERSON	was elected by his col - 172 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, leagues upon his retirement from the chair of Greek at
St. Andrews	ORGANIZATION	.

		A few inaccuracies , to be expected in the manuscript of lectures , seemed to have escaped the author 's eye in the revision for the press .

		Horace 's line in cute curandaplus aequo operetta juventus is quoted from memory nimium studiosa juventus -LRB- p. 88 -RRB- .

		The maxim '' to give is nobler than to receive '' is quoted as from
Hesiod	ORGANIZATION	's Works and Days . ''

		The student will seek it there in vain .

		In a few instances the passages cited are wrongly translated .

		Pindar did not say -LRB- P - 176 -RRB- , * in all that is pretty there is com - pnlsion , '' but '' compulsion -LSB- necessity -RSB- makes anything honorable '' justifies anything .

		Aris - tophanes , if the reference on page 21 is to the well-known passage of the '' Clouds , '' does not speak of '' filling up the image of virtue , '' but of '' polluting the image of modesty . ''

		The ren - derings of Heracleitus on page 91 are inexact .

		Fr .

		91 , for example , is not '' We can speak with confidence only while we follow the thought which comprehends all things , even as the law of the state controls all things , only much more firmly , '' but `` those who speak with intelli - gence must hold fast by the universal , even as a city holds fast by its law , and even more firmly . ''

		The text of the Pindaric passage on page 173 must follow some strangely obsolete edition .

		For
Ermine Rolide	PERSON	-LRB- page 246 and index -RRB- read
Erwin	PERSON	.

		It is misleading to speak -LRB- page 322 -RRB- of a contradiction between phys - ical and moral courage in the '' Laches . ''

		The '' Laches '' does not mention moral courage in our sense of the word .

		In a few other cases the views of the latest and best authorities have been ignored .

		Few scholars now mistake for intentional caricature the naive archaism of the Arcesilaus vase -LRB- page 167 -RRB- .

		The purer spirituality of
Aphrodite Ousania	LOCATION	is probably a Platonic fancy , and the contrasted epithet Pandemos has purely political significance .

		Demeter Achaia is probably simply
Achaean Demeter	PERSON	and not `` Our Lady of Sorrows . ''

		The Semitic origin of the Gephyraeans is rightly rejected by Toepfer , and the specula - tions about the Semitic strain in Harmodius and Aristogeiton are purely fantastic .

		These trifling inadvertencies in no wise impair the value of this readable and helpful sketch in outline of a great subject a worthy parergon of the author 's more serious studies .

		That he may enjoy his Italian retirement for many fruit - ful years , and crown his work with the promised
Platonic Lexicon	ORGANIZATION	, will be the hope of all his friends and admirers .

		* It was the brilliant observation of a wise man that in the foreigner we have contempor - aneous posterity .

		The dispassionate eyes of those who are to come after us exist , in all their critical possibilities , just across the nar - row line of nationality .

		If this is true of the nations of
Europe	LOCATION	in respect of one another , how much more true is it of
Japan	LOCATION	and its re - lations with
Christendom	LOCATION	!

		For the first time since the days of
Saladin	PERSON	and the
Saracens	LOCATION	, a nation as alert mentally as any professing faith in the Cross is looking with clear eyes through the centuries , selecting with marked abilities the good in our polity , rejecting with scrupul - osity all that seems to serve no useful end , bring - ing itself into accord with the facts of the modern world , and so within a generation or two accomplishing by a process of artificial evo - lution all that we Occidentals wrought through dark and bloody ages .

		Mr.
Stafford Ransome	PERSON	, an engineer of re - pute , and for a time the correspondent in
Japan	LOCATION	of the '' Morning Post '' of
London	LOCATION	, has pre - pared a book which has for its object the bring - ing within Western comprehension the pro- gress of the Japanese Empire since the over - throw of
China	LOCATION	.

		But while giving us the opportunity to see with his trained powers of observation what it is that has taken place in that country , he incidentally provides a pair of
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	spectacles wherewith we may see our - selves .

		This , we are sure , is the greater achieve - ment of the two , and by much the more inter - esting .

		Mr.
Ransome	PERSON	has done wisely in endeavor - ing at the outset to overthrow any conception of these most capable people which the traveler may base upon life in the treaty ports .

		He institutes a parallel between that and the judg - ment a Japanese might form of
England	LOCATION	if there were established , say at Wapping Old Stairs , a foreign commercial community which did not acquire the speech of the country , but lived its own life in its own manner , preserv - ing its customs and costumes , and violently abusing in its own press all that it found in the stranger land inharmonious with its own ideas , chiefly because the English workmen , interpreters , cabmen , and the like , were not educated gentlemen .

		THE DIAL 173 morality these sojourners would form of the English , basing their conclusions on the dis - orders incident to a seafaring and transient population .

		The writer does not say , as he might have said , that with many men environment serves for morality , and the laying off of accustomed associations too often serves as an excuse for hideous immorality ; but he calls attention to the fact that the complaints brought against the Japanese by Europeans are largely of hab - its formed in compliance with European de - mands , and , as far as native wit will serve , on European models ; and he goes further , and in an illuminating passage replies to the foreign critic by showing that all he urges against the morality of this Oriental race the Japanese sends back in kind as an accusation against foreigners as he has seen them .

		This is as it should be , and it may serve to destroy that cocksureness in the virtues of our own civiliza - tion which leads us to obtrude it upon others .

		One of the recent speeches of Count
Okuma	ORGANIZATION	is translated for our benefit : '' Comparing Europeans with Japanese , I do not think that the Europeans then -LSB- thirty years ago -RSB- in
Japan	LOCATION	were a particularly high class of persons ; nor do I think that those here now are particularly high class .

		On the whole , I think they would not have been reckoned higher than middle-class in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Among diplo - matic officials there may have been men of high stand - ing , but the general run of merchants were of the middle and lower classes .

		Middle and lower classes though they did belong to , however , when we compare them with the Japanese of the time , how great was the dif - ference in the degree of their civilization .

		The for - eigners living in
Yokohama	LOCATION	,
Nagasaki	LOCATION	, and so forth , seemed to know everything , and were many degrees superior to the Japanese .

		Their ideas were so large that the Japanese were astounded .

		I was a student at the time , and I remember that on one occasion , think - ing that a certain foreigner was a wonderful scholar , I went to ask him a question , but when I look back now I recognize that he was not even equal to a Japanese middle-school graduate .

		Still , I was surprised at the explanations I received from him . ''

		Here , in a word , is set forth the facts to which we so-called progressive nations must accustom ourselves .

		If this is news to us , so is much of similar purport which Mr.
Ransome	PERSON	brings .

		He warns us more than once against mistaking the present condition of
Japan	LOCATION	for a new thing brought about by the waging of a particularly successful war .

		What the sub - jects of the Mikado are to-day they have been fitting themselves for from a time really an - terior to the epoch-making voyage and diplo - macy of
Matthew Calbraith Perry	PERSON	.

		The perti - nent question of '' Who , among the Europeans , brought it about ? ''

		is answered decisively , with - out pretence of modesty , and convincingly .

		It certainly was not the leading merchants of for - eign birth , nor their consuls , nor even their ministers and ambassadors .

		It was not even any one conspicuous in the European colonies in the various treaty ports .

		As will be shown presently in more detail , it was not the mis - sionaries , though these contributed to the result with fine unconsciousness .

		Who , then , was it ?

		Two classes of educated persons , chiefly Englishmen and Americans ; one of them laboring in the educational world as professors in the
Imperial University	ORGANIZATION	and other state colleges , men , as the author writes , who '' were leading a more or less retired life , so far as the rest of the European world in
Japan	LOCATION	was concerned '' ; the other laboring in the manufacturing world as engineers and executive officers , and also remote from their countrymen socially .

		It is only natural that these unobtrusive elements in the shaping of modern
Japan	LOCATION	should be overlooked , until an engineer , who is by reason of his attainments to be classed among them , brings them into the light ; but it is not quite what we were expecting .

		Hardly less to be foreseen is the entirely candid estimate which is set upon the mission - aries and their work .

		In the beginning of their career in
Japan	LOCATION	, each mission sought to gain the support of the natives by the same means now used in social settlements among our own less favored communities .

		Chief of these were schools , both secular and religious .

		Coming at a time when the Japanese were seeking knowledge with an avidity we can hardly conceive , these schools were most suc - cessful .

		But , Mr.
Ransome	PERSON	points out , this was only until the government could make its own intelligent arrangements for the instruc - tion of its people ; and to-day the mission school which does not afford a better educa - tion than the government has ceased to exist as a factor in Japanese life .

		Most of them , indeed , have had to be secularized in order to survive .

		And as for the scholars , they gained their education , and , not finding Christianity useful , let it fall into desuetude .

		If
Japan	LOCATION	is to become Christian at all , the book concludes , it will be by some such process as the missionaries to northern
Europe	LOCATION	were familiar with hundreds of years ago , when the king declared for the new faith and his sub - jects meekly followed him into the fold .

		It may suit the purposes of the Japanese govern - 174 THE DIAL -LSB-

Cross	ORGANIZATION	.

		If the man - date is given , it will be obeyed .

		If it is not given , the people will remain as they are .

		The one thoroughly effective missionary establish - ment in
Japan	LOCATION	to-day , says Mr.
Kansome	PERSON	, is conducted by French Jesuits .

		Space does not permit consideration of other things in this excellent work , though many are of almost equal interest .

		There is a chapter on the modern drama which is a masterpiece of unintentional criticism of us by the native actors .

		The business man will find pages devoted to his needs , which he can not afford to neglect .

		Students in many widely different fields of human endeavor will find matters falling within the scope of their specialties .

		The book is well printed , and excellently illustrated with half-tone reproductions of photographs .

		his place among the hard workers of the world .

		Two things are very marked about this hook .

		One of them is the author 's sympathy for the weaknesses of average humanity , or his belief that the upright life is achieved not by a straight path , but rather by one that zigzags its way along with many missteps .

		The other is the curious and loving intimacy which he displays with the things of nature with the woods and fields and the living things that inhabit them .

		It is the intimacy that only a country boyhood knows , and that most men lose when other interests super - sede .

		Mr.
Waterloo	PERSON	has preserved this feeling for nature in all its freshness , and his best pages are those which are given over to its expression .

		As to construction , this novel is well-planned , although the closing episode of the race to record a deed seems to be affixed like an incongruous bay-window .

		The graces of style are not given to the writer , but he commands homely and acceptable English of a vig - orous sort .

		When we took up Mr.
George Morton	PERSON	's Greek story of '' A Fair Brigand , '' we feared another idyl in the manner of his '' Constantino , '' dealing mainly with native types , and seeking after poetic effect more than dramatic incident .

		But we found instead an exciting story of the same general type as About 's Roi des Montagues , '' with a similarly stirring plot , and the substitution of exaggerated American humor for the more delicate French wit .

		Mr.
Horton	PERSON	is a journalist , and the temptation to burlesque the de - vices of '' enterprising '' newspapers and their spe - cial correspondents was doubtless strong , yet this introduces a broadly farcical element into what would otherwise be consistent serio-comedy .

		The hero of this tale is a student in the American school at
Athens	LOCATION	, which institution the author has viewed at first hand , but with sufficient detachment of mind to enable him to discover the humorous aspects of this nest of archaeologists .

		The termination of the story is abrupt and unsatisfactory .


Henry of Navarre	ORGANIZATION	has furnished material for more than one romancer , and his appearance in Mr.
W. H. Johnson	PERSON	's `` The King 's Henchman '' will be pleasantly remembered by assiduous readers of cur - rent fiction .

		In '' King or Knave , '' by the same au - thor , we have a continuation of the story of
Jean Fourcade	PERSON	, combined with the courtship of the
King	ORGANIZATION	and
Gabrielle	PERSON	d'Estre ` es .

		The story of the Armada is introduced in the early chapters , to be followed by the conflict of the royalists with the
League	ORGANIZATION	, the assassinations of both Guise and the
King	PERSON	, and the triumphal progress of the Be `` arnain to
Ivry	PERSON	and the certainty of the throne .

		It is Henry the ardent and unscrupulous lover rather than
Henry	PERSON	the warrior who is presented to us in these pages , and the figure is not a sympathetic one .

		As for
Gabrielle	PERSON	, it must be admitted that she accepted dishonor with her eyes open , and neither the book of history nor the novel now before us can make of her a heroine to love and admire .

		Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	has certainly caught the trick of the conventional romance of history and deals with his material in very pretty fashion .

		1899 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 175 In '' A Gentleman Player , '' Mr.
R. N. Stephens	PERSON	adds noticeably to the laurels already won for him by '' An Enemy to the King '' and '' The Road to
Paris	LOCATION	. ''

		The '' gentleman player '' of this romance of
Elizabethan England	LOCATION	is one of the performers at
the Globe Theatre	ORGANIZATION	, reduced to this state of reverses , although a gentleman born and bred .

		The author is even daring enough to introduce the figure of Shakespeare himself into the opening chapters , and to set speech upon his lips .

		But the
Globe	ORGANIZATION	and the
City	LOCATION	are soon left behind , for the substance of the story relates to a wild-goose chase which the hero leads the Queen 's poursuivant , impersonating the friend whom he seeks to save from arrest , and with such success that for five days of exciting flight northwards , the pursuer follows the false trail thus laid , and misses his real object altogether .

		There is a heroine , of course , and equally of course she is cold and haughty until the closing chapters , when she melts in the approved fashion of all such hero - ines .

		The author has devised some extremely clever situations , chief among them being that in which the '' gentleman player , '' caught at last , contrives to escape by enacting the part of
Tybalt	LOCATION	in a provin - cial performance of '' Romeo and
Juliet	PERSON	, '' given by his former associates in a town where his captors have been delayed for a few hours .

		It is difficult to discover the author of so sweet and graceful a novel as ''
Claudia Hyde	PERSON	'' in '' The Ladder of Fortune , '' Mrs.
Frances Courtenay	PERSON	Bay - lor
Barnum	PERSON	's latest work .

		Somehow or other , the characters with whom she deals seem to react upon her expression , and in the present case , since the characters are hopelessly commonplace and vulgar , the effect is unfortunate .

		The book tells the story of an uneducated and unimaginative American , with an extraordinary talent for making money , and of his wife , a woman of the hard , vulgar , unsympa - thetic sort , with an equal talent for elbowing her way into society .

		It is simply the record of her progress up the social ladder , from the frontier town in which the start is made to those circles of wealthy Americans and Europeans into which it is possible for the energetic parvenu to effect an entrance .

		The two characters are remorselessly depicted , and the writer 's attitude toward them is one of mingled admiration and loathing .

		It is hardly needful to re - mark that no writer who thus stands outside his characters can make them live .

		By way of con - trast , we get near the end some refreshing glimpses of an unspoiled daughter of these parents , and in the story of her love , the charm of simple and whole - some ideals of life finds its way into the story .

		But the total impression is unpleasant , and we wonder that Mrs.
Barnum	PERSON	should have had the resolution to write such a book . ''

		A Tent of Grace '' is a Rhineland story of the middle nineteenth century .

		The heroine is a Jew - ish girl , rescued as a child from a life of wretched - ness , and adopted into the family of the village pastor .

		She grows up to be a very beautiful girl , and the son of the family falls in love with her , thus putting to naught the ambitions of his parents , and raising the question of race and religion in all its bitterness .

		As a child , the heroine had been beaten nearly to death by a crowd of angry Christian children , and the same spirit of Judenhetze pursues her into the after years , and finally causes her murder at the hands of a mob of fanatical rustics .

		Here is evidently the material for an effective story , and it must be said that Mrs.
Lust	PERSON	is thoroughly conver - sant with the scenes and situations of which she writes .

		But unfortunately she has no delicacy of style , and the chromo-coloring of the heightened episodes , as well as the awkward touches bestowed upon the details , are a constant offence to a refined taste .

		We should judge that English was an ac - quired idiom rather than the birthright of the novel - ist , and the very considerable force of the book is offset by the failure to attain to felicitous express - ion . ''

		The Mandate '' is a novel of hypnotism , insom - nia , and insanity .

		Lest this cheerful summary re - pel prospective readers , we hasten to add that , granted the unpleasant stuff with which the writer has had to work , the novel is an example of skilful workmanship considerably above the average .

		We always suspect hypnotism as a motive in fiction ; it is apt to lend itself to the cheapest sort of sensa - tionalism , and to imaginings in the name of science which science would indignantly disavow .

		But in the present case , the motive seems to be used in a legitimate way .

		The hypnotist is a gentleman who happens to be in love with the wife of his subject -LRB- the latter being a most objectionable person of the cad or bounder variety -RRB- , and suggests to him when in a trance , that he will die at a certain hour on the following day .

		The hour comes , and the man dies , but the situation is saved scientifically by presenting physical conditions amply sufficient to account for his taking off , without invoking the explanation of the hypnotic suggestion .

		The real centre of inter - est is not in the death of this most superfluous hus - band , but in the mental condition of the hypnotist .

		The latter firmly believes that he has committed murder , and it is from this conviction that we pass into the tragedy of insomnia and insanity that ends the tale .

		As a psychological study , it is worked out with considerable power , and the novel displays so much general ability that it is really far more inter - esting than this outline would indicate . ''

		Adrian
Rome	LOCATION	'' is a novel of modern English society , having for its hero one of those '' problem - atic characters '' described by
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, and so typi - cal of our modern age that many a novelist , both before and after
Herr Spielhagen	PERSON	, has been im - pelled to deal with them .

		Through defect of will and lack of a definite purpose he makes a failure of a life that seems to offer every opportunity of suc - cess .

		Weakly renouncing the love that might have given him strength to live , he enters into an alli - ance of the formal sort that leaves the springs of feeling untouched , and a tragic ending is the only way out of the impasse into which he has drifted .

		176 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, There is much excellent observation in this story , combined with effective delineation , and a finished method of expression .

		Mr.
Grant Allen	PERSON	's latest book is a pot-boiler un - abashed .

		This being the case , we need waste no words in commenting upon style , plot , or character - ization .

		It will be sufficient to state that '' Miss Cay ley 's Adventures '' tells the story of a young woman who finds herself penniless in
London	LOCATION	, and who concludes that this is just the time for her to make a tour round the world .

		That she carries out her plan successfully , and has many entertaining experiences by the way , may be taken for granted by those who know the sprightliness of the author 's invention .

		The book makes pleasant unprofitable reading , and holds the attention throughout . ''

		When the Sleeper Wakes '' is a somewhat dis - appointing book .

		The fertile fancy of the author , and his quasi-scientific way of dealing with vast or grotesque impossibilities , have not resulted , upon this occasion , in a story that is either clear or convinc - ing .

		We are simply dazed at the twenty-first cen - tury
London	LOCATION	into which we -LRB- in company with the awakened sleeper -RRB- are incontinently plunged , and the system of girders , and wind-vanes , and flying stages which are the author 's principal marvels , seems to be the outcome of a cheap and confused invention .

		There is much ingenuity about the forecast , much skilful elaboration of details , but there is no imaginative reach , no real impossiveness .

		Were it not for the copyright of the present year , we should take '' A Princess of Vascovy , '' by Mr.
John Oxenham	PERSON	, for a reprint of some early essay in fiction-writing .

		Certainly , it has little of the careful style and psychological insight of '' God 's Prisoner , '' which we reviewed a few months ago , and has , in fact , nothing to recommend it save the interest of the plot .

		Considered merely as a story , however , as an ingenious and straightforward nar - rative , it holds the attention closely , and may be pronounced successful .

		The heroine is a princess of a quite imaginary kingdom in
Eastern Europe	LOCATION	, and she comes to her own after a career of the most varied adventure , beginning in the wilds of
South America	LOCATION	, continued in the islands of the
Pacific	LOCATION	, and ended in the little realm to which fate at last restores her .

		The book is somewhat in the fashion of Mr.
Hope	PERSON	's '' Zenda '' tales , and its incidents are of a similarly exciting character .

		Still more suggestive of the '' Zenda '' sort of ro - mance is Mr.
Arthur W. Marchmont	PERSON	's '' A Dash for a Throne . ''

		Here we have an actual personation of the prince by the hero , who lends himself to the in - trigue , first , because it seems the only way of work - ing out the ends of justice , and afterwards , pour U * beaux yeux of the heroine , whom he can not de - sert in her hour of peril .

		The throne in this case is specifically that of
Bavaria	LOCATION	, although the happen - ings described are as far from any actual history as are those chronicled in the imaginary annals of
Ruritania	LOCATION	.

		The story is a capital one , reeking with romantic sentiment , and filled to the full with vil - lanies , all of which the hero ontwiU .

		We have to thank the writer for much exciting entertainment . ''

		Castle Czvargas '' is a capital romance of Con - tinental adventure in the seventeenth century .

		It was in the year of the Great Fire that an English lad was sent by his parents on a journey to
Munich	LOCATION	for the purpose of transacting certain business con - nected with an inheritance .

		His task performed , he set forth on the homeward journey , but was cap - tured and held imprisoned by a robber-baron in the wilds of
Southeastern Germany	LOCATION	.

		News of hit * plight reaching
England	LOCATION	, his brother started upon an ex - pedition of rescue , and the story told us is that of the skill and strength of arm with which the two English youths got the better of Count Czvargas , captured his own stronghold from him , compassed his well-deserved death , and carried away from captivity at the same time the German maiden who is the heroine of the romance .

		It is an exciting tale , fit to captivate both old and young .

		`` The Garden of Swords '' is the fantastic title given by Mr.
Max Pemberton	PERSON	to a story of the Franco-Prussian War , which culminates in the siege and capitulation of
Strassburg	LOCATION	.

		The heroine is the English wife of a French soldier , and the private interest of the story is centred about her relations with an Englishman , serving in the
Prus	PERSON	- sian army , who has befriended her in an hour of deadly peril , and risked his own life by entering the doomed city to bring her news of her captured husband .

		The husband learns of all this devotion only to place upon it the most dishonorable inter - pretation , and his conduct is so contemptible that it is not easy to rejoice in the reconciliation between the two , even though it takes place at the bedside where he lies fatally wounded by one of the besieg - ers ' shells .

		With all due pity for the sufferings of the French people in their year of agony , the author makes his lack of genuine sympathy with them a little too evident , and it is clear that both his ad - miration and his heart go with the invaders .

		For the rest , the story is prettily told , with some poetry of phrase , and a fairly vivid realization of its dra - matic possibilities .

		The great and deserved vogue of Mr.
Sienkiewicz	PERSON	has had its natural consequence in the translation of his unimportant and immature work , his trans - lator relying on the magic of the author 's name to secure a public for the least of his productions .

		We can not say that this result is a regrettable one , for everything that can throw light upon the develop - ment of so great a talent is of interest , but readers must not expect too much of the book now pub - lished , which was the first of the author 's literary works .

		Considered absolutely , '' In Vain '' is of small value ; considered as a first book , written by a boy of seventeen , it is one of the wonders of lit - erature .

		Glaringly crude as it is in many ways , there is in it a distinct foreshadowing of the power that was to produce '' Without Dogma '' and The Children of the Soil , '' and it has also a consider - able degree of intrinsic interest .

		It is a novel of I
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 177 student days at
Kieff	LOCATION	, and was written when the author was himself a student at
Warsaw	LOCATION	.

		As a naive portrayal of university life in
Eastern Europe	LOCATION	, it offers us something so radically different from anything that the corresponding conditions in En - gland or
America	LOCATION	could offer , that for this reason alone it deserves attention .

		But it gives us more than this .

		It is a story of passion , of abnegation , and of moral triumph ; the wine of youth courses through its veins , and we forgive its faults for the sake of its obvious sincerity .

		Fru Amalie Skram , a Norwegian woman who is the wife of a well-known Danish scholar , has elected to write fiction under the banner of '' naturalism , '' and has been seriously likened to
M. Zola	PERSON	.

		Her work is now first introduced to the English public by a well-made translation of '' Professor
Hierony	PERSON	- mus . ''


Herr BjSrnson	PERSON	, who is a warm admirer of the writer , has characterized the book in these terms : It is the first time that a great author in full pos - session of her mental powers has had the opportu - nity of making such a study .

		Seeking quiet and treatment for a nervous affection , Fru Skram of her own free will became an inmate of a lunatic asylum .

		Thus she had a chance of studying one of those specialists in mental disease who are too apt to mistake rebelliousness for a sign of mental de - rangement .

		Of this doctor , of the patients , the nurses , her whole environment , she gives a picture so vivid , of such absorbing interest , that it can vie with the most thrilling romance . ''

		This praise seems to us overdrawn , and , assuming the writer 's pur - pose to be that of establishing abuses in the treat - ment of the insane , she is only half-convincing .

		It is indeed a chamber of horrors into which she leads us , but , barring a few minor instances of heedless - ness , the asylum seems to be conducted upon hu - mane and scientific principles .

		As far as
Hierony	PERSON	- mus is concerned , we can not make out what the writer is driving at .

		He is certainly an unsympa - thetic figure , but certainly not the monster she would have us think him .

		We should warn pros - pective readers that the book has no plot whatso - ever ; it is the bare journal , day by day , of the asylum experiences of the heroine , and does not even end with her release .

		This suggests possibil - ities of more volumes of the same sort , which may Heaven avert .

		investing la reading the `` Reminiscences of reminiscences the King of Roumania '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , of a King .

		ag edlted by .

		Mr
Sidney Whitman	PERSON	, one may naturally reflect how differently this mod - est yet effective story of political effort and achieve - ment would have been told had the hero and nar - rator been , not Prince
Charles	PERSON	, but another extant scion of the Hohenzollerns , whose Consecrated Per - son we need not specify .

		What paeons of self - gratulation , what apostrophes to the irresistible joint might of '' Ich und Gott '' should we in that case have had !

		But Prince
Charles	PERSON	is , of all
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean sovereigns , perhaps the one least touched with the royal megalomania .

		The task which he faced , when as a young lieutenant he was called upon , a quarter of a century ago , to assume the rule of a turbulent principality whose name was synonymous with change and alternating foreign occupation , was one of the utmost difficulty .

		His future kingdom lay in the cock-pit of the
Near East	LOCATION	, surrounded by petty powers whose governments were even more unstable than its own , and jealously regarded by both
Russia	LOCATION	and
Turkey	LOCATION	, for each of which powers it had for nearly a century formed a bone of con - tention .

		Out of this political and financial chaos the young Prince , through the exercise of really remarkable ability as statesman and soldier , gradu - ally brought Roumania to its present independent and comparatively stable and flourishing condition .

		The story of this achievement is interestingly and almost too self-effacingly told in these Reminis - cences .

		The narrator touches briefly upon his mar - riage to the Princess Elizabeth of Wied -LRB- the '' Car - men Sylva '' of letters -RRB- ; and his share in the
Turco	PERSON	- Russian war , in which he commanded a division of allied Russian and Roumanian troops , is dwelt upon in some detail .

		The correspondence of Prince
Charles with Bismarck	PERSON	, Queen
Victoria	PERSON	, and the German Emperor , forms an element of considerable interest , and the book must , on the whole , be re - garded as a desirable and an authoritative contri - bution to the history of the
Eastern Question	ORGANIZATION	.

		The editor provides an intelligently written sketch and appreciation of Prince
Charles	PERSON	, a portrait of whom forms the frontispiece of the well-appointed volume .

		The fight of Sixty-four years ago , when Mr.
R.	PERSON	a corporation
H. Dana	PERSON	, in his adventurous cruise with the people .

		Before the Mast , '' visited the coast of
Southern California	LOCATION	, his ship one day came to anchor in the roadstead of
San Pedro	LOCATION	, which he de - scribes as '' the only port for a distance of eighty miles . ''

		It was not much of a port , and not much of one was needed for the slender commerce of those pastoral days .

		But
fifty years later	DATE	, when the rich interior region had been developed , and
Los Ange	LOCATION	- les , its chief city , had become an important com - mercial centre , the need of an improved harbor was keenly felt .

		Two rival points on the sea - coast con - tended for the improvements which
Congress	ORGANIZATION	was asked to make
San Pedro	LOCATION	on the south , and
Santa Monica	LOCATION	on the west , each about twenty miles from
Los Angeles	LOCATION	, each having railroad connection with that city , and each having good natural advantages for a harbor , though the reports of the
U. S. engi	PERSON	- neers sent to make surveys were decidedly in favor of
San Pedro	LOCATION	.

		The interests of the great railroad corporation of
California	LOCATION	, the
Southern Pacific Com	ORGANIZATION	- pany , led it to desire the selection of
Santa Monica	LOCATION	, and the claims of this place were pressed with great force and determination , and with all the known and 178 THE DIAL -LSB-

		unknown resources of that almost omnipotent or - ganization .

		The citizens of
Los Angeles	LOCATION	were no less determined in favor of
San Pedro	LOCATION	; and a con - test was began which , carried on in
California	LOCATION	and in
Washington	LOCATION	, was waged for eight years with great stubbornness and sometimes bitterness , and finally resulted in a complete victory for the people .

		A government appropriation of nearly three
millions of dollars	MONEY	was secured , and after many vexatious and baffling delays , work was finally begun at
San Pedro	LOCATION	in
April	DATE	last .

		The story of this memorable contest has been well told by Mr.
Charles Dwight Willard	PERSON	, a practised and graceful writer , in a volume entitled '' The Free-Harbor Contest '' -LRB-
Ktngsley	ORGANIZATION	-
Barnes & Neuner Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Los Angeles	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		It is well worth reading , not only for its many interesting and often stirring episodes , but for its practical demon - stration that even the most powerful corporations are not all-powerful when opposed by an aroused and determined public sentiment .

		To be a bookish man and a states - man , as Lord Rosebery demon - strates in one of the best of his recent `` Appreciations and Addresses '' -LRB-
John Lane	PERSON	-RRB- , is not an easy nor necessarily a logical matter .

		Yet he goes back over the list of the prime ministers of En - gland for more than a century and produces results which must fill the American enthusiast for learn - ing and culture with envy .

		Among these , surely ,
Lord Rosebery	PERSON	is himself to be ranked , if only for the volume before us , with its interesting and mul - tifarious table of contents .

		A distinction , rather than a difference , is made between the
Apprecia	LOCATION	- tions , which include estimates of the life or work or character or all three of various persons , and of the city of
London	LOCATION	; and the Addresses , which deal with subjects less personal , the best of them being on '' Bookishness and Statesmanship . ''

		But all are taken from the lips of the speaker in some public place , and have been edited in their present form by Mr.
Charles Geake	PERSON	.

		They still retain the flavor of matters which , were they less literary in content , would make against their reception , yet they have with this a certain dry humor which is only less en - joyable in the printed page than it must have been when voiced by the speaker 's lips .

		Many other amiable qualities combine with this to make the speeches worthy attention and for those who intend to speak in public themselves of study .

		They are in the best of taste , they are sufficiently erudite , they are always happy in all the meanings of that greatly abused word , they are neither too long nor too short in fine , they have every qual - ity except those which enthusiasm and genius alone can lend .

		A clear idea of what an American college really is at a given moment was never perhaps caught with more success nor set down with more animation than characterizes '' Yale : Her Campus , Class - Rooms , and Athletics , '' by Messrs.
Lewis Sheldon Welch	PERSON	and
Walter Camp	PERSON	, two graduates of that ancient institution whose names are a guaranty at once for good workmanship and for a proper
Yale	ORGANIZATION	spirit .

		Just at what is generally felt to be a turning-point in the career of this great university and mother of universities , a large volume , almost encyclopaedic in scope and intention , is issued , from which may be had a conception of what
Yale	ORGANIZATION	men think of themselves and of their college .

		No department of the great university is left without commemora - tion , and the sub-title gives but a faint hint of this inclusiveness .

		One of the chapters is given the name , '' For God , for Country , and for
Yale	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		This represents the feeling throughout the large work ; yet it must not be taken as a universal panegyric even though the point of view is that of
Yale	ORGANIZATION	men for
Yale	ORGANIZATION	, and the rest of the world is not con - sidered except as subordinate .

		We have a notion that the preparation of a work ten years hence of similar purpose will show a different idea back of the university and perhaps a better and more generous one .

		That
Yale	ORGANIZATION	should feel the defeats in athletics of a single year sufficiently to call a general alumni meeting for the purpose of ascer - taining the causes leading up to them , has seemed to many friends of American colleges somewhat disproportionate when other matters in which
Yale	ORGANIZATION	has been interested are taken into account .

		Why it should be so , this book explains between the lines as well as in them .

		But it is something of which
Yale	ORGANIZATION	men should be proud in the main , and it is admirably presented by the publishers ,
Messrs. L. C. Page & Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		The figure of
William T. Sherman	PERSON	looms large in any account of the Civil War , and it is tolerably certain that time will rather enhance than diminish its proportions .

		An intelligent and complete biography of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	leader now appears in the Great Commanders '' series -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , partly from the pen of the late
General M. F. Force	ORGANIZATION	, who assumes the entire responsibility , and partly from the pen of General
J. D. Cox	PERSON	, who is even better known as a writer .

		The career of
General Sherman	ORGANIZATION	is so replete with incident , and that of the more import - ant sort , that greater brevity could hardly be looked for .

		The work is , accordingly , somewhat long .

		It is a pity , such being the case , that the index should be so hastily prepared as to leave it a lame guide at best to the 350 closely written pages .

		Though dealing first of all with the soldier , the work shows
Sherman	PERSON	in his private capacity as well .

		His steadfast refusal to be dragged into politics , on the ground that soldiers enough had been seated in the presidential chair , is brought out most strongly , and is greatly to the credit of the man .

		So , too , is the lifelong effort he made to bring about a re - form in the office of the Secretary , of War , a meas - ure to which Grant denied his support , yielding , as he did too often , to the persuasions of interested friends .

		Most of the evils and accumulated horrors Tke life oj veil re-told .

		1899 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 179 of the recent war with
Spain	LOCATION	are directly due to this , and the contumely heaped upon the recent Secretary of War is plainly shown to be the result of continued refusals to adopt the plain teachings of prudence and common-sense on the part of the highest authority in the nation .

		The book deserves careful reading , and should take its place beside the best volumes in the series which it is intended to accompany .

		_ historic past .

		changes in public sentiment within the last twelve months can not help being impressed by the lack of knowledge of the historic past of
America	LOCATION	, and the disregard into which it seems to have fallen .

		That supposed bul - wark against innovation and lack of precedent , the American bar , has really led the people away from the uniform traditions of five generations of our citizens , back to the point of view of the loyalist of the Revolution , whose very name has been adopted , all unconscious of the Europeanizing tendency common to them both .

		Why it is that all history should be disregarded , unless there is a wide and deplorable ignorance of that history , it is impossible to say ; but the publication at just this time of such a work as Mr.
Edward McCrady	PERSON	's '' History of
South Carolina	LOCATION	Under the
Royal Government	ORGANIZATION	, 1719-1776 '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- serves to accent the imputation of ignorance .

		The entire period treated is one in which the inhabitants of the
Carolinas	LOCATION	, in common with those of the conti - nent generally , were preparing to throw off just such a series of oppressions as they are laboring with to-day .

		It will be seen , as from the chapters dealing with the Indians , that we have actually lost something of the governmental acumen which then characterized our colonial ancestors .

		We are less jealous of the rights of others , and far less punctil - io ; ^ regarding our own individual rights ; we are governed with vust as little regard for our real wel - fare , and revenue is raised with just about the same conception of the interests of the taxpayers .

		Mr.
McCrady	PERSON	's book is both voluminous and interesting , though not well proportioned .

		The desire to set down everything , rather than to main - tain due perspective , leads to loose and illogical writing occasionally .

		But of the value of the work there can be no doubt .

		Some discouraging Sach H g ht a8 the distinguished Afri - reveiaiions of can explorer , Mr.
Lionel Decle	PERSON	, is the French army .

		aWe t -LRB- -RRB- thrQW upQn ^ Q condition of the French army by a narration of his experience as un volontaire d'un an in 1879-81 is lurid , and the book resulting , `` Trooper 3809 : A Private Soldier of the Third Republic '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , is most discouraging reading for those who , like
Abou ben Adhem	PERSON	, love their fellow-men .

		Making allow - ances for youth , for bitterness , for a possibly dis - agreeable manner , and for the personal equation , Mr.
Decle	PERSON	appears to have entered the French service with patriotic enthusiasm in the perfection of an athletic vigor none too usual in
France	LOCATION	, and to have left it at the
end of less than two years	DATE	as an invalid not far from death , and despairing of the future of his country .

		That he eventually recovered , and was able to make of himself rather an English - man than a Frenchman , disclosing administrative and executive abilities such as
France	LOCATION	stands desperately in need of , make the pity the greater .

		His native land , indeed , stultified her earlier treat - ment of him by placing him in command of a native transport service during the war in
Madagascar	LOCATION	, but only to bear witness that the casualties of that expedition would have been annihilation had the enemy been otherwise than cowardly .

		Incidentally to the narrative , though affording the undoubted reason for its publication at this time , a bright light is thrown upon the astounding disclosures of the
Dreyfus	ORGANIZATION	trial .

		No one reading these pages can doubt that
France	LOCATION	is virtually lying naked to her enemies as a result of flagrant delinquencies and gross favoritisms pervading her armies , and that the one animating purpose behind the officers now before the public is the prevention of further dis - closures of their worthless and vicious methods .

		European literature in cross-sections . ''

		The
Fourteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
F. J. Snell	PERSON	, is the third volume pub - lished in the series called '' Periods of European Literature '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , edited by Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	.

		This method of dealing with European literature in cross-sections has both ad - vantages and disadvantages ; the latter are pecu - liarly apparent in the case of the present volume , which has to include
Dante	ORGANIZATION	,
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	,
Boccaccio	PERSON	,
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	, and Froissart , on the one hand , and , on the other , the tag - ends of French court-poetry and Icelandic saga , the early stages of Scottish romance , the growth of the new lyric in
Italy	LOCATION	, and such names as
Marco Polo	PERSON	, Sir
John Maundeville	PERSON	,
St. Francis of Assisi	LOCATION	,
Jean Gerson	PERSON	, and
John Wiclif	PERSON	.

		There is no English scholar living who could do all this as it should be done , and it is no reproach to Mr.
Snell	PERSON	to say that , while he is a trustworthy writer upon the Italian and English phases of his period , bis knowledge concerning others is defective .

		The drama of the fourteenth century is omitted altogether from this survey , being left for the writer of the volume that will follow in the chrono - logical order .

		Mr.
Snell	PERSON	's style is good , although marred by an occasional bit of misplaced flippancy , and his work is thoroughly readable .

		Mystifying the mystery of
Dreyfus	ORGANIZATION	.

		What shall be said of a book like '' Dreyfus : Letters Written to His Wife from Prison '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- ?

		The writings , translated from the French by Mr.
L. G. Moreau	PERSON	, cover the period from
December , 1894	DATE	, to
February , 1898	DATE	, and are introduced by Mr.
Walter Littlefield	PERSON	with a brief summary of this most extraordinary case .

		Americans , as a whole , have made up their minds that the accused French - man is innocent ; Frenchmen , on the contrary , 180 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, are resolved to believe him guilty .

		Real proof , either of guilt or innocence , xeems wholly lacking ; though the unfairness of the presumption of guilt without proof is as hateful to the mind of the believer in the common law as the presumption of innocence is to the advocates of French criminal procedure .

		If the General Staff of the French army has brought forth nothing of any moment in their attempt to show him a traitor , surely such letters as these afford neither proof nor presump - tion of innocence .

		If their publication at this time is for the purpose of influencing public sentiment in favor of this most unfortunate officer , it appears based upon the curious assumption that letters to a wife , written with the knowledge that they will be opened and read by those interested in proving the writer guilty , must contain the whole truth .

		The letters have no literary merit , as such .

		They are `` human documents '' undoubtedly , and may well serve as models of passion , hope , despair , grief , and affection , in combination .

		But they no more enlighten the understanding relative to the writer 's character than some of the statements of the
General Staff	ORGANIZATION	and that is saying a great deal .

		Mr.
William T. Jacks	PERSON	has written what he styles the first consecutive '' Life of Prince Bismarck '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- composed in the English language .

		Mr.
Jacks	PERSON	has succeeded fairly well in his desirable undertaking , and his book , though rather scrimped and superficial and not impeccable in point of style , may be pronounced a good one for popular reading .

		The publishers have given it a handsome setting , and it is liberally illustrated .

		There is a map of Ger - many from
1815	DATE	to
1866	DATE	, and the author has judi - ciously inserted a chapter dealing with the political history of
Germany	LOCATION	during the epoch immediately preceding
1847	DATE	.

		It is fair to Mr.
Jacks	PERSON	to say that he has been somewhat handicapped by the necessity of keeping his narrative within certain prescribed limits within which it would not be possible to com - press even a measurably full and satisfactory ac - count of the Chancellor 's career .

		A popular biography of Bitmarek .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		`` Dante Interpreted , '' by Mr.
Epipbanius Wilson	PERSON	-LRB- Putnam -RRB- , is a simple and straightforward account of the poet 's life and work , illustrated by many extracts which the author has translated into the form of the Spenserian stanza .

		The book is of the sort that attempts nothing original , and that may safely be recommended to beginners , although it is by no means upon the plane of
Maria Rossetti	PERSON	's '' Shadow of Dante , '' or
J. H. Sy	PERSON	- monds 's '' Introduction to the Study of Dante . ''

		Of the latter work , by the way , a new edition -LRB- the fourth -RRB- has just been published -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , at the instance of Mr.
Horatio F. Brown	PERSON	, the author 's literary executor .

		The '' Eversley '' form of book , which was devised by the Messrs.
Macmillan	PERSON	many yean ago for the needs of a new edition of
Kingaley	LOCATION	, has proved so sat - isfactory to the public , that writer after writer has re - appeared in its tasteful dress , and no small part of the best English literature is now obtainable in the volumes of this design .

		We need mention only the names of
Arnold	LOCATION	, Church , Gray ,
Huxley	LOCATION	, Lamb ,
Milton	LOCATION	,
Morley	PERSON	, and
Wordsworth	PERSON	, in illustration of the scope of the series .

		At present , a
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is being added , under the editorship of Mr. C. 11 .

		Herford , whose notes and introductions are scholarly and brief .

		There are to be ten volumes in all , of which five have now ap - peared .

		They are a little thicker than is usual with this series , but still most convenient to handle , and will , we doubt not , become very popular .

		A new edition , with an enlarged glossary of Sanscrit terms , of ''
Vedanta Philosophy	ORGANIZATION	, '' has just been pub - lished by the
Baker & Taylor Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		The frontis - piece is a portrait of the author , the
Swami Vivekananda	PERSON	, so well known to the attendants upon the
Congress of Religions	ORGANIZATION	in
1893	DATE	.

		The book is too well known to re - quire further comment , and the present edition will meet a growing demand for authentic information of this sort .

		The `` Cumulative Book Index , '' published at Min - neapolis by
Messrs. Morris & Wilson	ORGANIZATION	, appears in a double number for
April	DATE	and
May	DATE	.

		It covers a period of sixteen months , and makes a volume of between three and four hundred pages .

		In other words , it is a com - plete card catalogue , by author , title , and subject , of all the books published in this country from
January , 1898	DATE	, to the date of the present issue .

		The usefulness of such a publication needs no explanation .

		Consul-General
Wildman	PERSON	's `` Tales of the Malayan Coast '' -LRB-
Lothrop Pub ' g Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- were gathered during his three years ' consular service in the
Malay Peninsula	LOCATION	.

		The tales are seventeen in number , and include such titles as '' Baboo 's Good Tiger , '' '' A Fight with
Illanum Pirates	PERSON	, '' `` The White Rajah of
Sarawak	LOCATION	, '' King Solo - mon 's Mines , '' '' The Sarong , '' '' The
Kris	PERSON	, '' '' Amok , '' '' Busuk , '' '' A Pig Hunt on Mt. Ophir , '' and ' A
Croco	PERSON	- dile Hunt . ''

		Many of them are exciting , some are blood - curdling , and all derive interest from their portrayals of a quarter of the globe regarding which we were in so profound -LRB- and perhaps blissful -RRB- ignorance a year ago .

		Dr.
Fred Morrow Fling	PERSON	, of the
University of Ne	ORGANIZATION	- braska , whose helpful pamphlets of source extracts for the scientific study of history have frequently been com - mended to our readers , has just published -LRB- Lincoln :
Miller	PERSON	-RRB- a little volume , entitled '' Outline of Historical Method , '' designed to help the progressive teacher to some acquaintance with the methods of modern histor - ical scholarship .

		It is a clear analysis of the work of
M. Seignobos	PERSON	and
Herr Bernheim	PERSON	, intended to bring the methods of historical criticism and research within the range of the untrained teacher , and deserves a wide circulation .

		The little hand-book on '' English Meditative Lyrics '' -LRB-
Curts & Jennings	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a companion to a similar volume from the same pen on similar productions in
America	LOCATION	.

		The professor of English in
Princeton	LOCATION	, Dr.
Theodore W. Hunt	PERSON	, has again shown his faculty for saying much that is suggestive in little space , and perhaps no work of recent years so ably provokes the reader to better ac - quaintance with the lovely verses to which reference is had .

		The book will serve for the novice and for the critic equally , the groupings being as useful to the lat - ter as the large amount of information must be to the former .

		1899 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 181 ANNOUNCEMENTS OF FALL , BOOKS .

		As we predicted some time ago , THE DIAL 'S list of forthcoming Fall publications , presented herewith , eclipses that of any year in the history of the American book trade .

		The number of titles entered is nearly 1600 , against
1350 last year	DATE	, which latter number was a considerable increase over any previous season .

		These lists are therefore a very good index perhaps the best that may be had to the condition and progress of the publishing business in this country .

		They are prepared in all cases from advance information procured espe - cially for the purpose , and represent the output of 62 publishing firms : the highest number from any one firm being 200 , and the average 25 for each firm .

		All the books here given are presumably new books new editions not being included unless having new form or matter ; and the list does not include Fall books already issued and entered in our regular List of New Books .

		Juvenile books are , from their great number , deferred to another issue .

		The more interesting literary features of this List are commented upon in the leading editorial in this issue .

Cicero	LOCATION	, with Selections from the Letters , '' edited by President
\ V. R. Harper	PERSON	and Mr.
Frank A. Gallup	PERSON	, is one of the latest publications of the

		The Moravian Book Concern , of
Bethlehem	LOCATION	,
Pa.	LOCATION	, will publish shortly a book descriptive of travel in
Europe	LOCATION	half a century ago , entitled `` Fifty Years After , '' by Mrs.
Mary Wiley Staver	PERSON	.

		Messrs.
A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the American pub - lishers of '' A Selection from the Poetical Works of
James Thomson	PERSON	, '' as edited by Mr.
Bertram Dobell	PERSON	, the English publisher , and also one of the closest of
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	's friends .

		The effect of the dramatization of a novel upon the sales of the book is strikingly shown in the eases of '' Rupert of Hentzau '' and '' The Gadfly , '' the stage representation of which has been attended by a demand for a new edition in each case .

		Among American novels that have won success abroad is '' When Knighthood Was in Flower , '' which has reached its tenth thousand in
Canada	LOCATION	, and is being translated into German .

		Its sales in this country have reached nearly a hundred thousand , those for
August	DATE	being the largest since its publication .

		The prospective publication , by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, of Vicar
Thompson	PERSON	's memoir of the great lexi - cographer
Liddell	PERSON	will be awaited with especial interest by lovers of
Thackeray	PERSON	.


Liddell	PERSON	and Trackeray both went to the Charterhouse school , where
Liddell	PERSON	some - times did
Thackeray	PERSON	's Latin exercises for him .

		Though one went to
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and the other to
Cambridge	LOCATION	, they remained life-long friends .

		It was Mrs.
Liddell	PERSON	who , when '' Vanity Fair '' was appearing , asked
Thackeray	PERSON	to let Dobbin marry
Amelia	LOCATION	, and he answered , `` He shall , and when he has got her he will not find her worth having . ''

		Mr.
George C. Shaw	PERSON	, of
Cincinnati	LOCATION	, is about to pub - lish `` The Hesperian Tree : An Annual of the
Ohio Valley	LOCATION	, '' a work planned and edited by Mr.
John James Piatt	PERSON	, and containing contributions by such writers as Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, Mr.
James Lane Allen	PERSON	, Mr.
R. U. Johnson	PERSON	, Mr.
Madison Cawein	PERSON	, Mr.
John Hay	PERSON	,
Miss Helen Hay	PERSON	, Mrs.
Piatt	PERSON	, and Mrs.
Catherwood	PERSON	.

		The volume will extend to four hundred pages , and will be richly fur - nished with illustrations .

		The '' Rosamund '' of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's forthcoming tragedy is that queen of the Lombards who conspired with another to assassinate her husband
Albovine	PERSON	, in revenge for the wrongs he had done her .

		The story , as told by
Machiavelli	ORGANIZATION	, is that
Albovine	PERSON	-LRB-
Gibbon	PERSON	's Alboiu -RRB- , after having slain
Rosamund	PERSON	's father , forcibly married her , and at a banquet compelled her to drink from a drinking cup made out of the dead king 's skull , and pledge Alboviue in a toast .

		The way in which
Rosamund	PERSON	compasses this revenge is , in certain essen - tial points , different from her method in
Middleton	LOCATION	's play of `` The Witch '' and also in
Alfieri	PERSON	's play on the same subject .

		Mr.
Robert Clarke	PERSON	, the veteran bookseller and pub - lisher of
Cincinnati	LOCATION	, died in that city
August 26	DATE	, at the age of seventy .

		Mr.
Clarke	PERSON	was a native
Scotchman	PERSON	, who came to
Cincinnati	LOCATION	in
1840	DATE	, and in
1858	DATE	founded the house that has since borne his name and has become one of the most widely known and respected book es - tablishments in the country .

		Mr.
Clarke	PERSON	was especially interested in American history and bibliography , and his bookstore was preeminent in this department .

		He himself edited a number of works in this field , and pub - lished many more .

		The business will be continued by his former employees and business associates ,
Messrs. Hill	PERSON	,
Barney	ORGANIZATION	, and Dale .

		It describes the life on ship - board , the heaving sea , the rocking atrip , the whittling winds , the yo ho of the aeamen , and the sea-sickness of the immigrants .

Mary	PERSON	, who thenceforward figure throughout the book .

		They make a home in
Arkansas	LOCATION	and their expe - riences in that
Southern State	ORGANIZATION	are recited at length with graphic power , and not a little satiric wit .

		The strange people they meet , the unwonted environment , in brief , the new world they find themselves precipitated into with all their old - world inheritances and habits still upon them , are described at full length , in a series of chapters at once amusing and dramatic .

		Border life , with all its contrasts , is depicted , and at last a denouement , somber and sorrowful , is reached .

		The reader upon closing this novel will pronounce it one of the most fascinating in literature .

		This work , however , has merit enough to stand upon its own basis , and would itself make a reputation .

		Its peculiar value is , that it shows the versatility of
Sienkiewicz	PERSON	; it affords specimens of his style , in the difficult art of short story writing ; and it also presents some magnificent illustrations of his rare dramatic power .

		His play , in part fifth of this bonk , entitled '' WIN OR LOSE , '' compares favorably in life and glow with '' Cyrano de Bergerac . ''

		The poet , the dramatist , and the novelist are blended in one in these pages .

		251 FRENCH POETRY AND ENGLISH .

		The subject of the comparative merits and capabilities of the French and English lan - guages as media for poetical expression comes up periodically in the literary journals , and appears to be as far from settlement as ever .

		In its modern critical phase , the discussion seems to have found its starting-point in that puzzling final chapter of
Taine	PERSON	's '' English Lit - erature , '' which makes an elaborate comparison between Musset and
Tennyson	PERSON	, and returns a verdict in favor of the French poet . ''

		I pre - fer Alfred de Musset to
Tennyson	LOCATION	, '' were the words with which
Taine	PERSON	closed the chapter , and for many years his English critics refused to take such a dictum seriously , setting it down rather summarily as one of those aberrations of judgment into which the best of men are apt to be betrayed by the conditions of their own milieu and moment .

		No doubt the char - acterization of '' In Memoriam '' as '' cold , monotonous , and often too prettily arranged '' lent color to the assumption that the French critic was incapable of feeling what
Tennyson	PERSON	meant to his English readers , and that his preference for Musset was nothing more than an illustration of racial prejudice .

		After all ,
Taine	PERSON	was a Frenchman , poor thing , and could not be expected to know any better .

		These words would fairly sum up the undercurrent of feeling that ran beneath the various polite phrases with which his bizarre opinion was glanced at and dismissed .

		The subject being thus brought into the forum of discussion , a great many English writers were found to hold a similar view , and it got to be a sort of critical commonplace to say that , while French prose was an unsurpass - able form of expression , French poetry was not to be compared with English , that the French language was incapable of - scaling the higher peaks of poetical sublimity , or of sounding the deeper harmonies of song .

		The weight of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's authority was added to this concurrence of lesser opinion , and the question seemed to be settled .

		Moreover , who but an En - glishman could enter into the spirit of English poetry , and how presumptuous it was for French - men , one of the most distinguished of whom had called Shakespeare '' a drunken savage , '' to pre - tend to understand it .

		As for the ability of an Englishman to see all that there was in French poetry , and to expose the hollowness of its pre - tensions , that was quite another matter .

		Mat - thew
Arnold	LOCATION	, we are told , was fond of quoting French Alexandrines followed by
Shakespear	PERSON	- ian verses , whereupon he would exclaim '' What a relief '' !

		Now , with all due respect for this great critic , such a method of comparison proves nothing more than the possession of a fatuous national self-sufficiency on the part of the writer who makes use of it , and the fact that a French critic would reverse the process , and feel equally relieved by the Alexandrine cadence , is all the answer that such an argument 22s THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, needs .

		The ideal method of dealing with the dispute would probably be its reference to a court of arbitration composed , say , of Russians and Hungarians equally familiar with both French and English , if such might be found .

		In the matter of mutual comprehension and appreciation , both French and English criti - cism have advanced , of late years , far beyond the point at which it was possible for a French - man to ignore English literature altogether , and for an Englishman to assume complacently the entire superiority of his own poetry over that of his neighbor across the Channel .

		There have been too many careful studies of English literature by French critics , and too many in - terpreters of French poetry to English readers for either of these provincial positions to be maintained , and it is highly significant that a recent volume of essays by Professor
W. P. Trent	PERSON	should again take up the question of
Tennyson	LOCATION	and Musset , this time to refer to it in the following language : ' To those of us who have been allowed to see the error of our way through our reading of Hugo ,
Leconte	PERSON	de
Lisle	LOCATION	, and Musset himself , who have learned to our surprise that much of what our teachers had told us about the insufficiency of the French language to the expression of high po - etic thought and sentiment was due to mere ignorance on their part , a doubt has perhaps come more than once whether
Taine	PERSON	was not partly justified in his preference for Musset over
Tennyson	LOCATION	. ''

		This passage is significant simply because it abandons the old arrogant English attitude , and evinces a disposition to reopen the question once thought to be closed , to reexamine it in an enlightened spirit and with a candid mind .

		Mr.
Trent	PERSON	by no means claims to reverse the former decision , but he does go so far as to say that '' it is certainly permissible for those who care for the lyrical expression of intense passion to maintain that they find little or nothing in
Tennyson	LOCATION	that takes the place for them of Musset 's chief poems . '' ''

		C'est cette TOIZ da ccenr qoi Male an ooenr arrive , Que nul antra , aprfa toi , ne nous rendra jamais . ''

		The whole general subject of French and English poetry has been under discussion by a variety of pens during the past three months in the pages of `` The
Saturday	DATE	Review , '' and it is not often that the '' silly season '' of En - glish journalism gets hold of so interesting a theme .

		The discussion was started by the irrepressible **
Max	PERSON	, '' apropos of Mme.
Bern	LOCATION	- hardt 's `` Hamlet , '' and for once this humming - bird critic plunged his beak into the very heart of the blossoms among which he was disporting .

		Complaining that `` Paix , paix , nine troublee ! ''

		for example , was entirely inadequate to repro - duce the '' Rest , rest , perturbed spirit ! ''

		of the original which is undoubtedly true he said : `` The fact is that the French language , limpid and exquisite though it is , affords no scope for phrases which , like this phrase of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's , are charged with a dim significance beyond their meaning and with re - verberations beyond their sound .

		The French language , like the French genius , can give no hint of things beyond those which it definitely expresses .

		For ex - pression , it is a far finer instrument than our language ; but it is not , in the sense that our language is , suggest - ive .

		It lacks mystery .

		It casts none of those purple shadows which do follow and move with the moving phrases of our great poets . ''

		With these observations the train was fired that led to a series of veritable explosions of opinion on the part of correspondents of the paper , and the discussion which was thus evoked is not yet ended , for every week brings to it some further contribution .

		First of all , another `` M. B. '' rallied to the defense of the language thus attacked , denied the charges in toto , and quoted various pas - sages which were certainly not lacking , to a properly attuned ear , in the quality of mys - terious suggestiveness . ''

		I maintain , '' said the writer , '' that
Racine	LOCATION	's lines ' Ariane , ma soeur , de qnel amour blentie , Votu mouiutes aux borda ou voua lutes laissle ! '

		Are quite as suggestive as * Rest , rest , per - turbed spirit ! ''

		We , for one , will not deny the haunting quality of the couplet , which casts shadows quite as purple as those of the Shake - spearian phrase brought into comparison .

		This writer closed his letter with a felicitous revival of the old '' Punch '' story about the little girl and her nurse . ''

		And you must know ,
Parker	PERSON	, that in
France	LOCATION	they say Wee for Yes . ''

		`` La !

		Miss , '' answered the nurse , `` how paltry ! ''

		The letter above described at once excited the combative instincts of Professor
Tyrrell	PERSON	, who rushed into the fray with the argument that French is '' an essentially emasculated tongue , in fact , pigeon-Latin . ''

		Had the Dub - lin professor been content to leave his argu - ment unsupported by examples , all might have been well , but in an unfortunate moment he added : '' When a Frenchman says a girl is 4 beaucoup belle ' he is using Latin as a Chinese would be using English if he called her 4 good - whack good . ' ''

		The week following this several further communications appeared , but the main subject was for the moment forgotten in the opportunity offered to say cutting things about Professor TyrrelTs '' beaucoup belle . ''

		As one
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 229 writer remarked , '' An Englishman who said this would be treated to the courtesy due to strangers , but a Frenchman would be prepar - ing for himself an unhappy manhood and a friendless old age . ''

		After this interlude the original theme was again taken up , and illu - minated , during successive weeks , by an array of views and pertinent quotations that were unfailing in their interest .

		It may be said that such a discussion leads to nothing , which is in one sense true ; but in another sense we must say that it leads to a greater catholicity of temper and openness of mind , thus accomplishing a highly useful pur - pose .

		But the old misconception of French poetry as incapable of sounding the depths of the spiritual life is one that dies hard .

		We have never seen , on the whole , an abler plea for this view than was contained in a leading ar - ticle published last year in '' Literature . '' ''

		There are two great ways , '' we were told , '' by which men and nations may guide their thought ; the way of materialism , and the way of mysticism .

		Surely we may sum up the whole discussion by saying that the French nation has chosen the former , and that the French language reflects the limitations of the materialistic position . ''

		Surely ?

		Let this con - tention be met by
Victor Hugo	PERSON	. ''

		Ne possede-t-il pastoute la certitude ?

		Dieu ne remplit-il pas ce monde , notre e ` tude , Du nadir an ze'uith ?

		Notre sagesse aupies de la sienne est de ` mence .

		Et n'est - ce pas it , lui que la clarte * commence , Et que 1 ` ombre finit ? ''

		D'ailleurs , pensons .

		Nos jours sont des jours d'amertume ,
Mais	ORGANIZATION	, quand nous tendons les bras dans cette brume , Nous sentons une main ; Quand nous mflrchons , coin-he 's , dans 1 ` ombre du martyre , Nons entendons quelqu'un derriere nous nous dire : C'est ici le chemin . ''

		Again , `` French literature must have no strange - ness in the proportion , no vague epithets that hint of worlds unseen and unsuspected secrets . ''

		But what of
M. de Heredia	ORGANIZATION	's magical verses upon the companions of Columbus : '' Chaque soir , espdrant des lendemains e ` piques , L'azur phosphorescent de la mer des Tropiques Enchantait leur sommeil d'un mirage doi6 ; Ou , pench ^ s < \ 1 ` avaut des blanches caravelles , Us regardait monter en un ciel ignore '' Du fond de I ` Oce'an des e ` toiles nouvelles . ''

		Our writer concludes with these eloquent words : '' Our debate is not of what is true , but of what is beautiful ; the artist can not hesitate between the sacramental words and the chemical formula , and it must be said again and again that from the French ports no ship sails into faery lands forlorn .

		French literature is the most delightful garden in the world ; but the neat hedges of that gay parterre shut in the view , and no man stand - ing by the bosky arbors can behold the vision of Monsalvat or the awful towers of Carbonek far in the spiritual city . ''

		The beauty of these words is obvious , and equally obvious their sincerity ; yet thought of the work of Hugo alone is sufficient for their refutation .

		There is no note of music that he has not struck , no chord of the life of the soul that has not sounded from his lyre .

		The lyric rapture of '' Le Chasseur Noir '' and '' Un Peu de Musique '' is essentially one with the lyric rapture of
Shelley	LOCATION	, and above this height the wings of song may not be borne .

		The superiority of English poetry over French is in its quantity rather than in its quality .

		It may fairly be admitted that
Shakespeare	PERSON	and
Milton	PERSON	and
Shelley	PERSON	and
Tennyson	PERSON	outweigh
Racine	LOCATION	and Hugo and Musset and
Leconte	PERSON	de
Lisle	LOCATION	, but only those who are '' tone-deaf '' to the music of French verse and untouched by the sub - tleties of its emotional suggest !

		veness can maintain that it never soars to the highest plane of imaginative beauty and spiritual insight .

		THE USES OF THE BOOK REVIEW .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In the
September	DATE	''
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' I find a readable arti - cle by Mr.
J. S. Tunison	PERSON	on the Book Review . ''

		What is the value of the book review ? ''

		is the problem Mr.
Tunison	PERSON	sets himself to solve ; and he goes on to solve it in the necessarily rather discursive and Delphic fash - ion imposed on a man who has several pages of space to fill , and can not , therefore , content himself with a plain answer to a plain question .

		Let me try to give a plain answer to Mr.
Tunison	PERSON	's plain question .

		What is the value -LRB- or use -RRB- of a book review ?

		Why , precisely that which any description or characterization of a new thing offered for sale to the public has : it sets forth what the new thing specifically is , and helps the reader to judge whether or no the new thing is one which he , the reader , wants badly enough to buy .

		Ask us -LRB- or yourself -RRB- something harder , Mr.
Tunison	PERSON	.

		Of course if the reviewer chooses to throw in his personal opinion of the worth of the new thing , and even to expand him - self a little on topics mooted by his author , well and good .

		We , the subscribers , do n't grudge him his little literary fling ; but it is primarily his exposition that we want , and that we impliedly contract for when we sub - scribe for his journal .

		We take his journal as a guide to the book-market .

		Among Mr.
Tunison	PERSON	's acquaintances , he tells us , is a publisher who declares that '' No review ever sold a book . ''

		This '' acute '' man , it seems , argues it out as follows : There are some books -LRB- like '' Ben-Hur '' -RRB- that have sold well though neglected by reviewers ; there are some other books that have sold well though '' roasted '' by reviewers ; ergo , '' No review ever sells a 230 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, book . ''

		Logical man I I suppose be would argue , also : Some sick men have gotten well without the aid of a doctor ; some other sick men have gotten well though given up by the doctor ; ergo , No doctor ever helped a sick man to get well .

		No review ever sold a book !

		Alas , how much richer -LRB- in coin , at least -RRB- would the present writer be were that dictum a true one !

		The man given to buying more books than he can afford , who subscribes to a Review , deliberately courts danger and woos his besetting sin .

Commerce Clause	ORGANIZATION	of the Federal Constitution , '' discloses that the change which he thinks the
Federal Constitution	ORGANIZATION	has exper - ienced with respect to the question of nationality is a change not in law but in fact .

		In other words , there have been in the past dissents upon the subject among those whose views and actions should bave been gov - erned by the decisions of the courts .

		Those decisions have themselves consistently sustained the nationality of the
Federal Government	ORGANIZATION	The dissenters bave at last yielded to the views of the majority , and all now agree upon the theory of nationality ; and this change of opinion on the part of the minority is what the authors think has caused the
United States	LOCATION	to be `` com - pletely established as a national government . ''

		Giving this view full consideration , it seems to me tbat it jus - tifies the suggestions in my review .

		Those who read the review will remember tbat the work was treated by me as a legal essay , intended primarily for lawyers .

		I do not discover upon the face of the treatise that the authors have limited their views upon this subject to the fact of dissent from the decisions of the courts .

		The quotations from the book , made in the review , were found under the headings , '' Change in Theory of Constitutional Construction '' and '' The Application of the
Doctrine of State	ORGANIZATION	's Rights , '' the implication being plain tbat the theories advanced were legal proposi - tions .

		If the authors agree that the changes they dis - cover were not variations or vacillations in the course of constitutional decision , should not this circumstance have been made plain upon the face of a legal treatise ?

		But if we distinguish history from jurisprudence , and take the views of the authors as applicable to our history , is it just to treat the dissent from the decisions of the courts , which is merely agitated but does not prevail , as constituting any change in fact , even in our constitutional history ?

		Mr.
Prentice	PERSON	says that '' before the war the
Southern	ORGANIZATION	theories of construction had suc - ceeded in depriving the
Federal Government	ORGANIZATION	of many national attributes ; '' that whatever had been the legal relations between the States and the Federal Govern - ment , before the war , '' they were certainly not estab - lished in fact as they were afterward ; '' and that , until the war disposed of secession , '' State sovereignty was more thought of than
National	ORGANIZATION	sovereignty . ''

		Are these suggestions to be written down as a part of our constitutional history ?

		I know of no warrant , either in fact or in law , for such statements .

		To argue that these features distinguish our constitutional history before the Civil War , and tbat therefore that war his - torically established the nation , is in my view to mis - take cause and effect .

		Those who participated in the struggle for the maintenance of the Constitution and the
Union	ORGANIZATION	will surely agree with me in the view , not that nationality resulted as a fact because of the issue of the Civil War , but that the people put duwn the insurrection of
1861	DATE	in reliance upon and by virtue of the fact that , as
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	decided in
1793	DATE	and always subsequently held , the
United States	LOCATION	be - came a Nation under and by virtue of the Constitution .

		`` The relations between the States and the Federal Government '' were so thoroughly established by law , that the illegal attempt to sunder those relations proved a failure .

		AN APPEAL FOR NURSERY RHYMES AND JINGLES .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		A short time ago you were good enough to print a request from me for American variants of the '' Mother Goose Rhymes and Jingles . ''

		This request has bad a somewhat unexpected and unlooked-for result .

		Instead of finding any body of evidence that the old favorites have become corrupt , almost the contrary appears to be the case , for their purity seems to have been generally preserved in quite a remarkable manner ; this is prob - ably due to the fact that the '' Mother Goose Books '' have been for so many years made so cheaply that there can scarcely be found a home , however lowly , where there are children without a copy of the received text of the famous classic .

		The direct simplicity , the dramatic imagination , the vivid fancy , and the free and spontaneous humor of the '' Mother Goose Rhymes and Jingles '' will probably never be excelled by any body of modern verse , and will doubtless while our language lasts remain '' the light literature of the infant scholar . ''

		But since the collection was first printed by
Newbery	ORGANIZATION	, about the middle of the
last century	DATE	, many new verses and rhymes and jingles have succeeded in getting a foothold in the nursery , from which it would be as hard to dislodge them as to oust `` Mother Goose '' herself : such as , for example , some of the inimitable nonsense rhymes by
Edward Lear	PERSON	,
Longfellow	PERSON	's `` There Was a Little Girl , '' some of the verses of
Eugene Field	LOCATION	, Ten - nyson , and
Stevenson	PERSON	, not to mention many others .

		The kindergarten movement , too , has set many people ac - tively to work in writing nursery rhymes and jingles , play games , etc. , many of them , of course , worthless and doomed to perish as the sparks fly upward , but some of them , possessing in the main the characteris - tics of the '' Mother Goose Rhymes , '' will doubtless be perpetuated along with them .

		All this is reflected in the letters which I have re - ceived during the past two or three months from cor - respondents all over the country , and it is evident that the approved literature of the nursery has enormously increased during recent years .

		In making a collection of these modern classics of the nursery , it is impossible for one person to find out all of those which have taken a permanent place in the life of the little ones ; and I should like to make another appeal to your readers to ask them this time to send me the nursery rhymes and jingles which are familiar and popular in the nursery , but are not to be found in the '' Mother Goose '' collec - tions .

		THE DIAL 231 A FIGHTER FOB THE CONFEDERACY .

		* Dr.
John Allan Wyeth	PERSON	's animated account of the life and campaigns of that masterful character and untutored soldier of genius ,
General N. B. Forrest	ORGANIZATION	, is a desirable addition to the literature of the Civil War .

		Forrest 's reputation was long under a cloud owing to his alleged responsibility for the excesses at
Fort Pillow	ORGANIZATION	, and to the conception of him at the North as a superior sort of Quantrell who fought with little regard for the rules and amenities of `` civilized warfare '' -LRB- to use the current contradiction in terms -RRB- ; and it is well , now that the passions engendered by the strug - gle have cooled , that
Forrest	ORGANIZATION	's side of the case should be ably and fully presented .

		This office Dr.
Wyeth	PERSON	seems to us to have performed ; and while his book is one that will probably at some points excite controversy , we venture to say that no fair-minded Northern man , intelli - gent enough to form a liberal and rational opinion somewhat at variance with his general bias and sympathies , will read it without reach - ing the conclusion that the old war-time view of Forrest must now be largely revised , and that this fearless '' fighting leader of fighting men '' was , all in all , and despite what we at the North believe to have been his errors of politi - cal judgment and what his biographer admits to have been his grave defects of temper and training , a man of whose genius , courage , and achievements his country at large may now well be proud .

		It should be remembered that when the struggle ended in the defeat of the South , Forrest was emphatically one of those who ac - cepted the issue unreservedly and urged his neighbors to do likewise .

		Oblivion of the old order , and loyalty to the new , was the burden of his addresses in later years at reunions of his former comrades in arms .

		He honestly labored to expel the enmities of strife and the bitterness of defeat from his heart ; and when , in his last will , he bequeathed his sword to his son , he enjoined him to use it , should occasion offer , under the flag of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	with the same devotion with which it had been wielded for
the Southern Confederacy	ORGANIZATION	.

		One may pardon - ably conjecture that , had General Forrest lived , the close of the war with
Spain	LOCATION	would have found him , like General
Joseph Wheeler	PERSON	, * LIFE OF GENERAL
NATHAN BEDFORD FORREST	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
John Allan Wyeth	PERSON	,
M.D.	LOCATION	Illustrated .


New York	LOCATION	:
Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	.

		one of the popular heroes of a re-united nation .

		While Dr.
Wyeth	PERSON	did not serve immediately under
Forrest	ORGANIZATION	, he was , during the
last two years	DATE	of the war , a private soldier in an Ala - bama regiment , four companies of which had been transferred from his command .

		It was the enthusiasm of these men for their former leader that first awakened his interest in For - rest 's career and personality , and led to the systematic researches of subsequent years , the fruits of which are embodied in the present volume .

		Dr.
Wyeth	PERSON	has evidently taken great pains in collecting and sifting his material ; and his book , apart from its biographical inter - est , must be pronounced a historical production of no mean importance .

		Its tone , naturally , is eulogistic ; and the extremely interesting chap - ter on the storming of
Fort Pillow	ORGANIZATION	is an able plea in vindication of
Forrest	ORGANIZATION	's conduct on that deplorable occasion .

		Nevertheless , Dr.
Wyeth	PERSON	's tone is not wholly uncritical .

		In his account of battles and campaigns he shows a disposition to judge with a measure of impartiality be - tween the often conflicting accounts of oppos - ing commanders , and he frankly admits the latent strain of savagery in
Forrest	LOCATION	's nature which led to acts of violence that were repented of in cooler moments , and the memory of which undoubtedly shadowed and haunted the Gen - eral 's declining years .

		Forrest , Dr.
Wyeth	PERSON	concedes , '' was not an angel by any means '' ; and his hero-worship does not prevent him from furnishing evidence enough in support of the concession , and in proof of the fact that in battle this guerrilla of genius lived up to his maxim that '' War means fighting , and fighting means killing . ''

		Forrest 's remarkable military ability met with tardy * recognition from the chiefs of the Confederacy .

		The educated soldiers , graduates of West Point , under whom or beside whom he served , were slow to perceive , or at all events to admit , that this fighting civilian , who could not pass a cadet 's examination , who knew noth - ing of tactics and strategy save what he had picked up in the field , was their equal and often their superior in the actual practice of war .

		Forrest 's very lack of academic training made him , in a special way , a peculiarly dan - gerous opponent .

		There was no predicting , in the light of the established principles of mili - tary science , what he was going to do next ; and the
Union	LOCATION	generals were constantly baffled by his erratic movements and hawk-like swoops , as the skilled fencer who fights by the book may be nonplussed by the furious onset of an 289 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, untaught yet a phenomenally strong , swift , and resourceful antagonist .

		Says General
Sherman	PERSON	, in whose side
Forrest	LOCATION	was a perpetual thorn : '' I think Forrest was the most remarkable man our Civil War produced on either Hide .

		... He had never read a military book in his life , knew nothing about tactics , could not even drill a company , but he had a genius for strategy which was original , and to me incom - prehensible .

		... He always seemed to know what I was doing or intended to do , while I am free to confess I could never tell or form any satisfactory idea of what he was trying to accomplish . ''


Jefferson Davis	PERSON	is quoted by the author as saying , in reply to Governor
Porter	PERSON	of Ten - nessee , who had spoken of Forrest as '' the first cavalry leader of the war '' and as historically rated as one of the half-dozen great soldiers of the country '' : '' I agree with you .

		The trouble was that the generals commanding in the
Southwest	LOCATION	never appreciated For - rest until it was too late .

		Their judgment was that he was a bold and enterprising partisan raider and rider .

		I was misled by them , and 1 never knew bow to measure him until I read his reports of his campaign across the
Tennessee River	LOCATION	in
1864	DATE	.

		This induced a study of bis earlier reports , and after that I was prepared to adopt what you are pleased to name the judgment of history . ''

		General
Joseph E. Johnston	PERSON	, the masterly strategist , pronounced Forrest the greatest sol - dier of the war ; while Lord
Wolseley	ORGANIZATION	,
Forrest	ORGANIZATION	's most competent foreign critic , says : '' Panic found no resting-place in that calm brain of his , and no danger , no risk , appalled that dauntless spirit .

		Inspired with true military instincts , he was verily nature 's soldier .

		It would be difficult to find in all history a more varied career than his , a man who , from the greatest poverty , without any learning , and by sheer force of character alone , became the great fighting leader of fighting men , a man in whom an ex - traordinary military instinct and sound common-sense supplied to a very large extent his unfortunate want of military education .

		His military career teaches us that the genius which makes men great soldiers is not to be measured by any competitive examination in the science of war .

		In war , '
Napoleon	PERSON	said , ' men are nothing ; a man is everything . '

		It will be difficult to find a stronger corroboration of this maxim than is found in the history of
General Forrest	ORGANIZATION	's operations . ''

		Forrest was a man of reckless personal daring .

		He was usually in the thickest of the fray , fight - ing like a paladin , and inspiring his men by word and deed .

		He never carried a field-glass into battle , because his place was at the front .

		He seemed to bear a charmed life , though wounded many times .

		He had , in all , twenty - nine horses shot under him ; and it is known that he placed thirty Federal officers and sol - diers hnrB de combat in hand-to-hand encount - ers .

		Unsparing of himself , he exacted equal conduct from his men .

		Shoot the first man that flickers , '' was his standing order in battle ; and he was more than once himself the execu - tioner .

		A believer in Christianity , he showed the profoundest respect for its ministers , and gave the fullest possible opportunities for re - ligious services in camp .

		Once he greatly astonished a captured Federal chaplain -LRB- who expected short shrift at the bands of '' Forrest of Fort Pillow '' -RRB- by not only sending for him to dine in his tent , but by reverentially invit - ing him to ask the blessing . ''

		Next day a further surprise awaited the good man .

		He was conducted through the lines and sent on his way rejoicing by the
General	ORGANIZATION	, who humor - ously said , in parting , '' Parson , I would keep you here to preach for me if you were not so much more needed on the other side . ''

		For - rest 's respect for the cloth was forcibly mani - fested in the case of
Bishop Payne	PERSON	, who had been invited to preach for the command at
Tupelo	LOCATION	.

		After service , relates
Colonel Kelley	PERSON	, most of the officers called on the Bishop at the
General	ORGANIZATION	's tent , and one of them so far forgot himself as to give way to his habit of swearing . ''

		Forrest became so deeply indignant at the outrage - ous conduct of his subordinate that he could scarcely contain himself .

		He took me to one side , and in an earnest though low tone said : ' If you think it ought to be done , I '11 kick that hog out of the tent . ''

		Forrest had the vein of dry humor common in the
Southwest	LOCATION	.

		He once effectually spiked the guns of a loquacious widow who asked him in company why it was that his beard was still black while his hair was turning gray , by reply - ing that ' he did not know , unless it was be - cause he might have used his brain a little more than he had his jaw . ''

		Forrest was extremely illiterate ; and how carefully we should discriminate between illit - eracy and ignorance is impressively shown in his case .

		Education of a sort that trains a man 's powers of action and judgment to the highest point of efficiency , he had in full meas - ure .

		But of schooling in the usual sense of the term he had little or none .

		He was one of the ablest and most successful men that the South in his time had produced ; but it is doubtful if he had ever enjoyed even the slender advant - ages of the backwoods country school .

		Born in a cedar-log cabin in a remote settlement of middle
Tennessee	LOCATION	, and the son of a poor black - smith , Forrest was taken by his family at thir - teen to a still ruder region in
Mississippi	LOCATION	a mere wilderness too sparsely settled to afford the luxury of a schoolhouse .

		By sheer native force of character he fought his way upward in
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 233 civil as in military life .

		He was by turns far - mer , speculator , merchant , broker , and planter .

		When the war broke out he was a rich and influential man .

		While he acquired latterly a certain sense of literary style , as is shown in his clear and forcible dispatches and in his sometimes really eloquent addresses , he never quite rid himself of the homely vernacular of his boyhood .

		He always said '' mout '' for might , and '' fit '' for fought ; and his '' Tell Bell to move up and fetch all he 's got , '' is his - torical .

		He spelled as badly as
Marlborough	LOCATION	did .

		He subscribed himself '' Lut Genl '' ; and when he wrote a note of acknowledgment to his plucky girl-guide at
Black Creek	LOCATION	he ex - pressed therein his '' highest regardes to miss
Etna Sanson	PERSON	for hir Gallant Conduct , '' etc. .

		Forrest was frankly conscious of his ortho - graphical weakness and was chary in the use of the pen . ''

		I never see one , '' he said , '' but what I think of a snake . ''

		It is likely that Forrest inherited a large share of his tremen - dous energy and imperious temper from his mother an Amazonian woman of six feet in height , who survived a grapple with a panther , and of whom it is related that she soundly thrashed , with '' four peach-tree switches '' cut for the purpose , an eighteen-year-old son who had just joined the army and declined to soil his new ' `` soldier-clothes '' by carrying a sack of meal to the mill at her bidding .

		One is not surprised to learn that Mrs.
Forrest	PERSON	was thought by her neighbors to be rather '' set in her ways . ''

		Had she commanded a brigade at the front she would undoubtedly have '' shot the first man that flickered . ''

		In his chapter on the Fort Pillow '' massacre '' Dr.
Wyeth	PERSON	adduces a good deal of respectable evidence tending to clear Forrest of the charges brought against him at the North .

		At this dis - tance of time most of us will be free to admit the antecedent probability that the excesses at
Fort Pillow	LOCATION	were somewhat exaggerated by the
Northern	ORGANIZATION	authorities and newspapers .

		We all realize pretty clearly just now that the spirit of truth does not brood over
Washington	LOCATION	and sit in the soul of the American press in war-time .

		Dr.
Wyeth	PERSON	thinks that the finding of the Con - gressional
Committee	ORGANIZATION	upon the
Fort Pillow	ORGANIZATION	affair was a war measure designed to inflame and stimulate the North and to damage the cause of the South abroad .

		This view seems rather far-fetched , though doubtless the publi - cation of the finding was expected to have those effects .

		The
Committee	ORGANIZATION	probably gave what they believed to be an honest verdict on the evidence .

		Such direct testimony as they were then able to secure all pointed one way , and chimed with their natural preconceptions .

		Our own judgment is that the secret or the solution of the terrible
Fort Pillow	LOCATION	business is to be found , not in the character of General Forrest , but in the character and composition , the pecu - liar relation to each other , of the opposing forces .

		It seems only necessary to point out that the defenders of the fort were composed of Southern loyalists -LRB- _ '' Tennessee Tories '' -RRB- and runaway negroes , to indicate why the con - flict was so bitter and the victors were so ruth - less .

		There is a grim line in
Forrest	LOCATION	's sum - mons to surrender that shows that he foresaw and dreaded the scenes that followed the final assault : '' Should my demand be refused , I can not be responsible for the fate of your com - mand . ''

		Had the conquered garrison been composed of troops from the North there would have been no '' massacre of Fort Pillow . ''

		The volume is a presentable one outwardly , and contains many portraits of Confederate officers .

		We regret that we must here once more enter our old complaint of the lack of an index .

		E. G. J. THEORIES OF THE NATION AI , CONSTITUTION .

		* The Commentaries on the Constitution of the
United States	LOCATION	, prepared by the late Professor
John Randolph Tucker	PERSON	, of
Washington	LOCATION	and
Lee University	ORGANIZATION	, are now published under the editor - ship of his son and successor , Professor
Henry St. George Tucker	PERSON	.

		They treat seriatim the several provisions of that instrument , in a form somewhat similar to the commentaries of Judge Story .

		Agreeing in some respects with that eminent constitutionalist , Professor
Tucker	PERSON	differs from him toto coelo in others , notably in his theories concerning the process by which the nation grew , and the office of the Consti - tution in that process .

		One of the objects of this treatise is not only to renew the discussion upon that general subject , but to furnish a categorical reply to Judge Story 's criticisms upon the constitutional views advanced by the elder St.
George Tucker	PERSON	as the editor of Black - stone .

		Thus a portion of this work wears the aspect of a family controversy .

Interpretation	ORGANIZATION	.

John Randolph Tucker	PERSON	, LL.D .

Henry St. George Tucker	ORGANIZATION	.

		In two volumes .


Chicago	LOCATION	:
Callaghan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		234 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, always so calm and dignified as to appeal strongly to the sober thought of his readers .

		He bestows his most elaborate exposition and argumentation upon these questions as to the '' Genesis '' of the Constitution ; and to this branch of inquiry , as distinguished from the Development and the Interpretation of that instrument , he appropriates more than one - third of his entire space .

		Professor
Pomeroy	PERSON	, in his '' Introduction to American Constitutional Law , '' enumerates three schools of thought concerning the genesis of the
United States Constitution	ORGANIZATION	, namely , the
National	ORGANIZATION	school , the Secession school , and the intermediate school which bases the supremacy of the Federal government on inter-state com - pact .

		Professor
Tucker	PERSON	ignores entirely the Secessionist theory , apparently as not entitled to consideration in a legal treatise , and sched - ules '' two leading schools of thought '' on the subject .

		The first is the intermediate school of
Pomeroy	ORGANIZATION	's classification , which holds , as stated by this devotee of that school , that `` the unit of sovereignty is the
State	ORGANIZATION	, which is a Body Politic ; that the Constitution of the
United States	LOCATION	is a compact between these sovereign units and Bodies-politic , making a
Federal Union	ORGANIZATION	between the States '' -LRB- v. 1 , p. 178 -RRB- .

		The second school , as he well and tersely says , '' holds that the
Union	ORGANIZATION	itself is the unit of sovereignty , of which the States are subordi - nate parts , to which certain powers belong under the Constitution of the
United States	LOCATION	, while the main powers belong to the
National Government	ORGANIZATION	'' -LRB- p. 179 -RRB- .

		Professor
Tucker	PERSON	has marshalled very clev - erly and forcibly all the arguments which can be brought to the support of his theory that '' the
Union	ORGANIZATION	is a multiple of units . ''

		If that theory can be sustained by argument and logic , it would seem that he might do it .

		His elabo - rate efforts in that behalf , extending to 140 pages , will be interesting reading to all stu - dents of the constitution-making period in our national history .

		The fatal flaw in the logic employed to support the compact theory is apparent upon Professor
Tucker	PERSON	's pages .

		In his introductory chapters treating gen - erally of Sovereignty and the Body-politic , our author industriously exposes the fallacy of the Social-Compact theory of the basis of govern - ment , and adopts the modern American view of the rightful sovereignty of the People as a Body-politic , distinguished from the govern - mental agencies which it employs .

		In this Body-politic is vested '' all rightful political power over its members for the common good of all '' -LRB- p. 2 -RRB- .

		It is * the source of all au - thority ; the government is the agent or trustee it creates and to which it delegates powers '' -LRB- p. 351 -RRB- .

		This is the constitution-making power .

		A constitution is '' the act by which the Body-politic constitutes the government and delegates and limits its powers '' -LRB- p. 60 -RRB- . ''

		The Body-politic utters its sovereign will through the constitution , which calls govern - ment into being , organizes its functions , defines and limits its powers , and declares to this , its creature , by its creative fiat , ' thus far shalt thou go but no farther ' '' -LRB- p. 68 -RRB- .

		And '' this principle , the supremacy of the Body-politic as constitution - maker , and the subordination of the government as the delegated agent of the Body-politic , is therefore the foundation of American Constitutional Law '' -LRB- p. 66 -RRB- .

		These extracts are fair samples of the happy manner in which our commentator states propo - sitions which most of his readers will recognize as admirably descriptive of that Body-politic , the People of the
United States	LOCATION	, which , by its creative fiat , established the dual system of
Federal and State	ORGANIZATION	governments under the Con - stitution of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The larger part of his first three chapters might be incorporated bodily into a treatise like Story 's Commenta - ries , in support of the
National	ORGANIZATION	view of our Constitution from which Professor
Tucker	PERSON	so earnestly dissents .

		Of the supremacy of the government created by that Constitution , our author entertains no doubt .

		It is '' supreme , within the limits of the delegated powers , over all the constitutions and laws of the several States , and binding and operating upon the citizens of all the States , and by its terms , certain rights and privileges of the citizens of each are intercommunicated to those of every other '' -LRB- p. 256 -RRB- .

		And ** this supremacy is to be maintained through the judicial department of the States and of the
United States	LOCATION	, because it is declared that the judges in every State shall be bound thereby , that is , in their judicial action they must recog - nize the supremacy of the constitution '' -LRB- p. 376 -RRB- .

		From these premises , the logic is not obvious by which Professor
Tucker	PERSON	reaches his conclu - sion that the
United States	LOCATION	is a '' multiple of units '' -LRB- p. 179 -RRB- ; ** a confederacy by
State	ORGANIZATION	peoples '' -LRB- p. 287 -RRB- ; '' the multiple of Bodies - politic '' -LRB- p. 802 -RRB- ; and '' a confederation of States , but not a new composite , or one new civil Body-politic '' -LRB- p. 818 -RRB- ; and that the
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 235 Constitution is '' a federal compact between Bodies-politic '' -LRB- p. 256 -RRB- .

		What authority could erect , by means of the
United States Constitution	ORGANIZATION	, a frame of government which should be supreme over all the constitutions and laws of the several States , short of a Body-politic , answering Professor
Tucker	PERSON	's requirements , and composed of the People of the
United States	LOCATION	?

		In what smaller or more limited Body-politic would it be pos - sible for us to see vested '' all rightful political power over its members for the common good of all '' the people of the entire
United States	LOCATION	?

		The Constitution speaks in the language of self-conscious Sovereignty ; why shall we deny that in so speaking , '' the Body-politic utters its sovereign will '' ?

		By what process could the thirteen States create a new
State	ORGANIZATION	, or a new governmental agency , greater , for any purposes , or to any extent , than themselves ?

		By what process could they authorize the creation of a fourteenth
State	ORGANIZATION	, or any other additional num - ber of States , conferring upon those creatures equal power , dignity , and sovereignty with themselves ?

		How can we attribute to the
United States of America	LOCATION	a sovereignty supe - rior to that of any or all of the States , which was created by the act of those States ?

		This is impossible , as a result of inter-state compact , because it involves the idea of a granting or transferring of sovereignty ; and Professor
Tucker	PERSON	well says that '' Sovereignty , as essence , is one , indivisible , ungrantable , undistributa - ble , and always reserved '' -LRB- p. 60 -RRB- .

		Then no one of the thirteen Bodies-politic of
1789	DATE	, if it had so desired , could possibly have granted or transferred to any new power or State any portion of its inherent sovereignty .

		If , then , there were thirteen distinct peoples in
1789	DATE	, which desired to accomplish '' a more perfect Union '' than a League , there was no process which they could employ , save for each several people to relinquish all its sovereignty , and join all the others in forming a new Body-politic , the '' People of the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		This is the only logical theory deducible from Professor
Tucker	PERSON	's premises .

		It was this Body-politic which '' uttered its sovereign will through the Constitution , called government into being , organized its functions , defined and limited its powers , '' and declared to each of its creatures ,
Federal and State	ORGANIZATION	, '' thus far shalt thou go , but no farther . ''

		On the logic which leads to this conclusion , the human mind can rest ; and in these principles , '' the supremacy of the Body - politic as constitution-maker , and the subordi - nation of the created governments -LRB-
Federal and State	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- as the delegated agents of the Body - politic , '' can be seen '' the foundations of American Constitutional Law . ''

		Doubtless these considerations , though not expressed by him , were in the mind of
Chief Justice Marshall	ORGANIZATION	, when he said , in
1823	DATE	, in the case of
United States	LOCATION	v. Maurice : '' The
United States	LOCATION	is a government , and conse - quently a Body-politic and corporate , capable of attain - ing the objects for which it was created by the means which are necessary for their attainment .

		This great corporation was ordained and established by the Amer - ican people . ''

		The basis upon which Professor
Tucker	PERSON	rests his support of his compact theory is stated cat - egorically by himself . ''

		The written constitu - tion of
1789	DATE	must be what those who brought it into being and gave it the sanction of their ratification believed and knew it to be , and can not be changed by what men a century there - after choose to think it ought to have been '' -LRB- p. 180 -RRB- .

		But , suppose the men '' who brought it into being and gave it the sanction of their ratification '' did not agree as to just what the Constitution was ?

		Professor
Tucker	PERSON	accepts the verbal explanation of a portion of those men , and rejects the view of others .

		If there were men who then sincerely believed the Con - stitution was merely creating another league , there were others , equally sincere , whose ver - bal explanations of its dominant national fea - tures are convincing even now to '' men a cen - tury thereafter . ''

		Our commentator pays no regard to the contemporary views , as to the nationality embodied in the Constitution , of
Wilson	PERSON	and
Morris	PERSON	and
Findlay	PERSON	of Pennsyl - vania , and
King	PERSON	and
Gerry	PERSON	of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, nor to the opposition raised on this ground by
Smith of New York	ORGANIZATION	and
Martin	PERSON	of
Maryland	LOCATION	.

		He does cite the view of
Patrick Henry	PERSON	, that the result was '' a consolidated National gov - ernment of the people of all the States , '' only to report the contrary ideas of several who , in replying to
Henry	LOCATION	, seem to have had an under - standing of what our dual system in fact is .

		Among these is
Madison	LOCATION	, whose view our author does not seem to succeed in apprehending , for he quotes from that statesman the argument in the '' Federalist '' -LRB- No. 39 -RRB- , that the new Consti - tution would be in certain respects federal and not national , without giving the connoted view that in other respects it would be national and not federal , nor the conclusion there reached that the new government would combine both these features and be of a mixed character .

		It must be a similar misapprehension which seeks 236 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, to draw comfort for the State-compact theory , from the writings of
Hamilton	LOCATION	, who said in the ` Federalist , '' that ''
& Nation	ORGANIZATION	without a
National Government	ORGANIZATION	is an awful spectacle '' -LRB- No. 85 -RRB- ; and that '' the streams of national power ought to flow immediately from that pure original fountain of all legitimate authority , '' the peo - ple -LRB- No. 22 -RRB- .

		This is a fair expression of one phase of a Body-politic , such as Professor
Tucker	PERSON	describes , but composed of the entire people of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Both
Hamilton	PERSON	and
Madison	PERSON	seemed to clearly understand that a new type of popular government had been created , a dual system , possessing both
National and Federal	ORGANIZATION	features .

		Jefferson , too , as quoted by our author , declared to Madison in
1786	DATE	: '' With respect to everything external , we be one nation only , firmly hooked together .

		In - ternal government is what each
State	ORGANIZATION	should keep to itself . ''

		In a labored argument , the commentator seeks to show that the phrase , '' We , the people of the
United States	LOCATION	, '' might perhaps have been employed by the constitution - makers in the sense of '' We , the people of the confederated
States of New Hampshire	ORGANIZATION	, etc. , not as one civil Body-politic , but as a league '' -LRB- p. 296 -RRB- .

		But
Richard Henry Lee	PERSON	, the ''
Fed	ORGANIZATION	- eral Farmer , '' gave the phrase its simple and natural construction when he said , in
October , 1787	DATE	, '' It is to be observed that when the peo - ple shall adopt the proposed constitution , it will be their last and supreme act ; it will be adopted , not by the people of
New Hampshire	LOCATION	,
Massa	PERSON	- chusetts , etc. , but by the people of the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		The difficulty with the arguments advanced in support of the State-compact theory has always been , that they wrest terms from their true meaning , and juggle with definitions .

		The system of our Constitution under which the Federal government exercises the Supremacy , within its appropriate sphere , so distinctly stated by Professor
Tucker	PERSON	, does not allow to the States the enjoyment of '' sovereignty '' within the usual meaning of that term .

		To attempt to assign to the States their true posi - tion by any ordinary use of that term , is nec - essarily misleading .

		So , as we have seen above , the idea of a supreme Body-politic , such as our commentator describes , can be applied only to the nation ; and the attempt to place the States in the like category can result only in confusion of thought .

		Professor
Tucker	PERSON	seems to take umbrage at the presumption of Mr.
von Hoist	PERSON	, a foreigner born , in writing upon our constitutional history and criticising our statesmen .

		But his own pages furnish justifi - cation of Mr. von Hoist 's complaint that Amer - ican statesmen have '' bonajide , used the same word in most opposite senses , and employed words as synonymous which denoted ideas abso - lutely irreconcilable . ''

		Bent on subjecting every circumstance to the support of his chosen thesis , Professor
Tucker	PERSON	finds in the declaration of the convention of
Virginia	LOCATION	, on
May 15 , 1776	DATE	, in favor `` of a total separation from the crown and government of
Great Britain	LOCATION	, '' some evidence of individual action as a sovereign State .

		But
Virginia	LOCATION	at the same time declared for united action of the colonies toward independence , reserving to each colony the regulation of local and internal con - cerns ; and thus , like
Maryland	LOCATION	,
Virginia	LOCATION	was at the outset of the movement for independence , prefiguring the dual system .

		Again , respecting the deed of cession to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of the North - western lands , made by
Virginia	LOCATION	in
1784	DATE	, Pro- fessor
Tucker	PERSON	argues that
Congress	ORGANIZATION	was , by its acceptance of the deed , estopped to deny that
Virginia	LOCATION	, and not
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, had theretofore '' exclusive right of soil and jurisdiction to the territory thus ceded '' ; not considering the fact that , in yielding as she did , after a hot discus - sion for several years , to the claim of the smaller States that only the whole nation had a valid title in law to that '' right of soil and jurisdiction , '' and thereupon joining in the national legislation for the government of that territory on a national basis ,
Virginia	LOCATION	acqui - esced in the national theory and became in honor estopped to deny it thereafter .

		The correct method of formulating a satis - factory theory of the genesis of our Constitu - tion will not permit a reliance upon contempo - raneous declarations on either side of the disputed question .

		The results accomplished in fact must be allowed their proper weight , and often these will outweigh contemporary theories .

		So it is true that the lapse of years , furnishing a historical perspective , should en - able '' men a century thereafter '' to better understand the constitutional process and its results .

		Professor
Tucker	PERSON	demurs to this method of determining whether the Federal Constitution was an inter-State compactor an authoritative law .

		But he has employed the same process , with signal success , in his dis - cussion of abstract Sovereignty and the abstract Body-politic .

		On these subjects he reasons a priori , and in disregard of contemporary theory .

		The Bodies-politic he discovers in the original thirteen States took form at the in -
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 237 stance of men , many of whom firmly believed in the Social-Compact theory of government , and helped to embody that theory in laws and constitutions and judicial decisions .

		And here comes Professor
Tucker	PERSON	, '' a century there - after , '' and says of it : '' This theory is fiction , and as an hypothesis is unsound , and must lead to error '' -LRB- p. 3 -RRB- .

		So he employs more modern canons of study , and tests the processes of the formation of governments , in part by principles now considered as established , and in part by the results attained .

		A like independence of original investigation , employing the same a priori processes of reasoning , leads us to reject on similar grounds the inter-state-compact the - ory of the Constitution , and to attribute its creation to the People of the
United States	LOCATION	as a Body-politic .

		Outside of the controversial portions of his treatise , in respect to which he seems to hold a brief , Professor
Tucker	PERSON	's commentaries on the Constitution are judicious and well-consid - ered .

		He seems to favor , with
Chief Justice Marshall	ORGANIZATION	, and as lawyers usually do , a fair and reasonable construction of that great instru - ment , rather than either extreme of a strict construction which would fetter its necessary operations , or a broad and latitudinarian con - struction which would render its limitations meaningless .

		BRITAIN AND THE BOERS .

		* Those fond of historical parallels can trace an interesting one in the conduct of the
United States	LOCATION	toward
Spain	LOCATION	in
April , 1898	DATE	, and the conduct of
Great Britain	LOCATION	toward the
Transvaal Republic	ORGANIZATION	in
September , 1899	DATE	.

		As
America	LOCATION	was then , so is
England	LOCATION	now , busy calling the world 's attention to the enormities of the gov - ernment she intends to overwhelm , to the wrongs she and her subjects suffer by reason of her opponent 's misdoings , to the gain to civilization involved in her success , and to the divine mission of the Anglo-Saxon race , all as justification for an appeal to arms .

		That the world remains unconvinced of the good intentions of the aggressor in both cases , is certain .

		The Boer , too , like the Spaniard aforetime , * SKETCHES AND STUDIES IN SOUTH AFBICA .

		THE SOUTH AFRICAN QUESTION .

		By an English South African -LRB-
Olive Schreiner	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Chicago :
Charles H. Sergei Company	PERSON	.

		is making disregarded protestations , vainly peeking to turn the sympathy of some friend in
Europe	LOCATION	to real intervention , offering conces - sions which lead only to an increase of demands , urging an arbitration which is treated with contemptuous silence , and , finally , arming for a hopeless conflict a conflict in which over - throw is certain , spoliation assured , and a final insult added to injury in the statement that it is all for the sake of '' Humanity '' a word which the
United States	ORGANIZATION	has already placed on that bad eminence to which Mme. Roland raised '' Liberty . ''

		The analogy will go further : Dr.
Jameson	PERSON	was a filibuster , if ever there was one in
Africa	LOCATION	;
Majuba Hill	LOCATION	, like the destruction of the ``
Maine	LOCATION	, '' gives the British government the lever of revenge which serves so well in prying up the sympathy of the populace with aggres - sion ;
Gladstone	PERSON	's high-minded regard for treaty obligations , like
Cleveland	LOCATION	's , becomes the subject of popular abuse ; there are stones for those who counsel moderation , loud cheers for those who wish to fight , multitudinous dem - onstrations , turgid and self-righteous leaders , inflammatory news columns , and , at the end , deaths from bullets , deaths from disease , all the wholesale shedding of man 's blood and woman 's tears we call war ; and then the home-coming of successful officers to such glory as might have befallen Goliath had he slain the child
David	PERSON	.

		So accurately is history repeating itself , that it is small wonder to find the war organs in
America	LOCATION	justifying
Salisbury	PERSON	and
Chamberlain	PERSON	, or else roaring as gently as once roared Snug the
Joiner	PERSON	.

		Most of all is it en - couraging to the Anglo-Saxon alliance to find as the English found a year ago that our cousins across the sea are not a bit better than ourselves .

		All those arguments which led us to justify the statement of
Wendell Phillips	PERSON	, that a Yan - kee 's idea of hell is a place where he has to mind his own business , are set forth in detail , as if in proof of our kinship , in the work on
South Africa	LOCATION	by the Rev. Mr.
Knox Little	PERSON	, written in the good British fashion after a brief sojourn in
South Africa	LOCATION	.

		Mrs.
Olive Schreiner	PERSON	, in her statement of the question , makes a woman 's appeal to sentiment , and directs her appeal to
England	LOCATION	sober , just as the American constitu - tionalist is appealing to
America	LOCATION	before she drank the toxic draught of imperialism ; though neither can be said to present arguments that avail much when blood is in the eye and re - venge in the heart .

		It is perhaps too much 238 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, to ask that Mrs.
Schreiuer	PERSON	should prove the aggrieved party in the right .

		Rather does it rest with the Rev. Mr.
Knox Little	PERSON	to convince us that the aggressor is unselfish , the more so that he holds a brief for his nation .

		The Rev. Mr.
Knox Little	PERSON	's '' Sketches and Studies '' show us a writer with the candor of a churchman and the special pleading of a conservative politician .

		His admissions of
England	LOCATION	's series of prodigious misgovernments in
South Africa	LOCATION	are followed by professions of her eminent fitness to rule .

		His estimate of Mr.
Rhodes	PERSON	as an administrator based ap - parently upon no fact more remote than his enjoyment of that worthy 's profuse hospitality is the complement of his statement that
Gladstone	PERSON	was President
Krueger	PERSON	's dupe .

		The Boer , he tells us through his book , is un - cleanly in his person , unkind to the negro , indisposed to labor , unwilling to pay taxes , averse to learning English , impatient of mi - nute control , calvinistic in religion , prone to set faith before works , a driver of hard bar - gains , cunning in negotiation , and a number of other things which Mr.
Knox Little	PERSON	is not , all of them perhaps not desirable , but hardly affording a valid reason for depriving him of his hardly won liberties .

		Some of the author 's statements deserve quotation : ''
Krueger	PERSON	is not , perhaps , a statesman in the ordi - nary sense of the word , much less a very great man in any sense ; but he is a representative Boer in the sense that he thoroughly understands the people over whom he now rules .

		The
Transvaal Boer	ORGANIZATION	, speaking broadly , is extremely ignorant , extremely prejudiced , profoundly fanatical , hates government cordially , and consequently -LSB- .

		i ` c -RSB- dislikes the law-abiding Englishman .

		The love of money , the love of being ' a law unto himself , ' scorn of refinement or culture , are to him second nature .

		All this Mr.
Krueger	PERSON	seems clearly to understand .

		He has himself , however , in an eminent degree , two powerful characteristics dogged determination and extraordi - nary acuteness . ''

		This might be taken , for all its naivete , as showing the Boer more British than the
Briton	LOCATION	; but it is certainly a high tribute to President
Krueger	PERSON	, the higher for its being so manifestly begrudged .

		Here is another argument : `` There was a ridiculous fallacy allowed ... and pleaded since to do duty for truth .

		That was the doc - trine that the
Transvaal	LOCATION	was ' the * Boer 's country , ' or , as Mr.
Krueger	PERSON	a British subject born in the colony described it with astute effrontery , his ` fatherland . '

		The ` right ' to a new country must rest -LRB- 1 -RRB- upon an arrangement with those previously in possession ; or -LRB- ' J -RRB- on might , the might of conquest and the might to hold it ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- joined with one another of these , the right of just and good administration .

		By -LRB- 1 -RRB- the English hold the
Cape	LOCATION	and some other possessions , by -LRB- 2 -RRB- and -LRB- 3 -RRB- some other territories in
South Africa	LOCATION	.

		The
Boers	ORGANIZATION	held the
Transvaal	LOCATION	in so far as they did hold it by the right of < might , ' by defeating some of its previous possessors . ''

		Elsewhere in the book it is set forth in detail that the English acquired their title to the Dutch in
South Africa	LOCATION	from
Holland	LOCATION	in the manner in which we acquired our title to the Filipinos from
Spain	LOCATION	by the payment , in their case , of 6,000,000 ; that a large party among the
Boers	ORGANIZATION	made earnest protest against British occupation ; that the British entered upon a series of ill-advised and oppres - sive measures which fully justified the Grand Trek , i. e. , the wholesale shaking off of the British yoke by an emigration into the savage desert and the establishment there of an inde - pendent government in spite of almost over - whelming difficulties .

		It is certain also that
Holland	LOCATION	stole the land from
Portugal	LOCATION	, which had stolen it from the Negro ; and that no title can justify conquest .

		It will be noted that a parity of reasoning would send British armies into
Turkey	LOCATION	, into
China	LOCATION	, into
South America	LOCATION	,
Hayti	LOCATION	and
Central America	LOCATION	, into
France	LOCATION	to regulate the
Dreyfus	ORGANIZATION	case , and so on , to absur - dity ; while any nation would be justified in seizing
Ireland	LOCATION	, since the British could not then urge '' -LRB- 2 -RRB- , '' certainly could not plead a better title than '' -LRB- 1 -RRB- , '' and would hardly ven - ture to put forth '' -LRB- 3 -RRB- '' in any event .

		Noth - ing can * be more convincing of the lack of good faith of the British than this sort of argument .

		For the rest , it may be said that statements of maladministration and corruption brought by Mr.
Knox Little	PERSON	against the
Transvaal	LOCATION	gov - ernment and the individuals composing it , however often repeated , must fail with his fail - ure to recite details or any proofs whatever , since his handling of the book as a whole shows that he is sparing nothing to bring them into contempt .

		Let his attitude in this respect be contrasted with that of Mrs.
Schreiner	PERSON	.

		He says : ' It may be hoped that the nation whose proudest characteristic has hitherto been its love for liberty may yet recover its self-respect by withstanding injustice and wrongdoing with manly energy .

		Nothing can be really done to bring peace and prosperity to
South Africa	LOCATION	until
Great Britain	LOCATION	wakens to her duties and wipes out that corrupt Oligarchy , and transforms it into a real and free Republic or , still better , into a self - governing colony .

		Where there is freedom , there there will be a chance of fair dealing between man and man . ''

		Mrs.
Schreiner	PERSON	says : '' We look further yet with confidence , from the indi - vidual to the great heart of
England	LOCATION	, the people .

		The
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 239 great fierce freedom-loving heart of
England	LOCATION	is not dead yet .

		Under a thin veneer of gold we still hear it beat .

		Behind the shrivelled and puny English H -RCB- de who cries only gold , ' rises the great English Jekyll who cries louder yet ' Justice and Honor . '

		We appeal to him ; history shall not repeat itself .

		Nearer home , we turn to one whom all
South Africans	LOCATION	are proud of , and we would say to
Paul Krueger	PERSON	, Great old man , first but not last of
South Africa	LOCATION	's great line of rulers , you have shown us you could fight for freedom ; show us you can win peace .

		On the foot of that great statue which in the future the men and women of
South Africa	LOCATION	will raise to you let this stand written : `` This man loved freedom , and fought for it ; but his heart was large ; he could forget injuries and deal generously . '' '

		It may be said , in conclusion , that stock - jobbing interests have from the beginning been the controlling cause in the dispute be - tween
Chamberlain	PERSON	and
Krueger	PERSON	.

		The five - year-residence franchise which Englishmen notoriously decline in the
United States	LOCATION	, they seek in
Africa	LOCATION	, for no better reason , as Mr.
Knox Little	PERSON	admits , than that mining interests are taxed more heavily by the
Boers	PERSON	than they would be with the admission of the Uitlanders to citizenship .

		But he does not say that the cause which operates against the acceptance of the franchise in the
American Republic	ORGANIZATION	the forswearing of allegiance to the Queen is not an element in the British contention with the
Transvaal	LOCATION	.

		The
Boers	ORGANIZATION	, unless some one intervenes , are on the horns of a dilemma : If they grant their franchise to Englishmen who hold allegiance to the mother-country , that heritage of freedom they carved out of arid sands and savage hearts ceases to be theirs ; if they fail in this , still is that freedom sacrificed to advancing British bayonets .

		WALLACE RICE .


M. A. DsWoLFE HOWE	PERSON	has edited a series of short essays , under the general title of the '' Beacon Biog - raphies '' -LRB- Small ,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The aim of the series is to bring within a short compass an account of the lives of prominent Americans .

		Thus far the fol - lowing volumes have appeared : ``
Daniel Webster	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
Norman Hapgood	PERSON	; ''
Phillipps Brooks	PERSON	, '' by the ed - itor ; ``
Robert E. Lee	PERSON	, '' by Professor
W. P. Trent	PERSON	; ``
David Farragut	PERSON	, '' by
James Barnes	PERSON	; ``
J. R. Lowell	PERSON	, '' by Professor
E. E. Hale	PERSON	, Jr. .

		These little books are uniformly well done , and in the cases of
Brooks	PERSON	and
Lowell	PERSON	are exceptionally well done .

		In one or two instances the general unity of impression is lost by an attempt at giving too many details , but each volume is very readable , and as a whole the series will prove val - uable to the reader , even if at times the author seems to adopt the point of view of the apologist rather than that of the biographer .

		This is perhaps most evident in the volume upon Lee , and least so in that upon
Webster	PERSON	.

		RECENT BOOKS OF POETRY .

		* There is no decline from the earlier volumes of verse by Mr.
F. B. Money-Coutts	PERSON	in '' The
Alham	PERSON	- bra , and Other Poems , '' just now published .

		The anthor is one to reckon with , for he has technical mastery and his own distinctive form of utterance .

		There is poetical satisfaction to be got from every page of these firmly-knit and harmonious measures .

		Since it is sometimes well for a nation to see itself as it is viewed by others , we select for our illus - tration the fine sonnet on President
Cleveland	LOCATION	's Venezuelan message .

		`` Yes I it was well , and passing well , that we To do their pleasure for so small a thing , Refused to set wild war upon the wing , Or to defile that unensangnined sea , That flows between our Countries of the Free , With freight of fratricide !

		We let them ring Alarum ; kept us crimeless , and shall bring White record to the days that are to be I `` The time will come when they will look with shame On that time-serving message of their Chief ; His use ignoble of their noble name For paltry purpose , must be charged with grief For the harvest of their Age , when every sheaf Is garnered of their folly and their fame . ''

		There are equally vigorous lines dedicated to the rejection of the
Arbitration Treaty	ORGANIZATION	by our
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, and to our declaration of war against
Spain	LOCATION	.

		It is a friend , not a foe , who says these things , which should make them the more bitter .

		24 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, Mr.
Ernest Hartley Coleridge	PERSON	, inscribing to his father a copy of verses , observes : '' Mine ia a pale and imitative age .

		No purple rube for me Thy name , and this poor Terse my heritage .

		Which here I dedicate to thee . ''

		The modesty of the confession is becoming , for there is nothing in this Mr.
Coleridge	PERSON	's volume of '' Poems '' to suggest the royal lineage of the writer .

		Pious musings in reasonably smooth rhythm , and faint echoes from the song of departed masters , are all that is vouchsafed us . ''

		Art i hou not wounded ?

		wilt not stay ?

		Let u-i lie down and die .

		The fight ; 8 over for to-day .

		Why toil in vain , friend , why ?

		We -LRB- .

		hull not win to-day , nor yet to-night ; Shall never win , bat we can always fight ! ''

		This composite of the thought of
Miss Rossetti	PERSON	, dough , and Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	, is a characteristic ex - ample of our author 's work .

		Mr.
W. E. Brocklebank	PERSON	is a poet of gloom and melancholy .

		He looks at life only to behold the shadow of death cast upon it , and his lightest mus - ings have a funereal tinge .

		Even love dawns upon the trusting soul but to its undoing , as we learn from '' The Difference . '' ''

		Were you the moon and I the sea , Then love were well ; your kiss wonld fall In night 's sweet silent hours on me And my heart 's tides obey your call . ''

		Were yon the player , I the lute , Then love were well ; yonr hand wonld wake The chords that all the world leave mute .

		Ah , sweet music we should make ! ''

		Were you the sea and I the stream .

		Then love were well ; to your deep breast My whole tired life would come and dream .

		Made one with you in utter rest . ''

		But yon are woman , I am man .

		And therefore love is not all well ; `` I 'M like all love since Life began Heaven 's bark upon the sea of hell . ''

		These numbers are at least melodious , and melody is an almost unfailing attribute of Mr.
Brock	PERSON	le - bank 's verse .

		He almost makes sorrow seem beau - tiful , and the peace of death a boon to be desired .

		And in such a poem as the dramatic fragment , ''
Bellerophon	PERSON	in Argos , '' his blank verse attains a dignity of diction that is well-nigh Swinburnian in its movement .

		The Shadows , and Other Poems , '' of Mr.
E. Samuels	PERSON	are but five in number , and make up one of the thinnest of volumes .

		They reflect the moods of a man who has imagined happiness but never realized it , and the cast of deep melancholy is over them all .

		Such lines as these give a truthful ex - pression of the chastened pathos of renunciation : '' What is this little parting of our lives But the short passing of a winter day ?

		And we should only mar the perfect bliss Of coming
summer	DATE	time , if memory With aught might charge us we could wish undone .

		Yet is my life not wholly void of thee : Across the bleakness of this
winter	DATE	day At even steals the sweetness of a dream , And there I see thy face and hear thy voice .

		And roam together with tlu-c , until in mtul , Throughout the fair Elysian fields of uleep , Not knowing that but here , our waiting past , We all in all for evermore are one . '' ''

		The Silence of Love , '' by Mr.
Edmond Holmes	PERSON	, is a charmingly printed volume of fifty sonnets in the Shakespearian form .

		Their feeling is that of the man who conceives of love as too beautiful a thing to be realized , as better to dream about than to enjoy in full fruition .

		It is the feeling , in .

		- hurt , that Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	has expressed so forcibly in '' Love 's Comedy . ''

		One of the sonnets may be quoted : `` Sometimes in dreams I clasp thy breast to mine .

		And kiss thy lips and with thy tresses play , And through the floodgates of some outward sign Pour all the passion of my heart away .

		Sometimes in dreams I tell my secret so ; Then wake to find that it is still untold .

		That still the surging , storm-fed waters flow .

		By
Pate	PERSON	's relentless ramparts still controlled .

		Oh , better thus , better that passion 's force .

		Which love 's impatient raptures had set free .

		Pent in the prison of its channelled course , Should give the river strength to reach the sea .

		Better , for passion 's sake , that passion 's dream Should fade forgotten with the morn 's first gleam . ''

		This is the note of the entire sonnet series , and we must confess that it grows a little monotonous .

		Mr.
Holmes	PERSON	is master of a simple and even diction which is distinctly poetical at all times , yet which never exceeds the bounds of the conventional sort of expression that lies within the reach of almost any cultivated mind .

		The '' Poems '' of Miss
Eva Gore	PERSON	- Booth are mostly brief pieces , inclining to be epigrammatic , although now and then striking a sustained note of high seriounness .

		The writer scores rather neatly off `` A Critic '' in the following lines : '' His was the voice That when the morning stars together sang In their first rapture of awakened life And Qod 's own angels held their breath for joy .

		Whilst heaven , by that new harmony entranced , Was wrapped in awful silence broke the charm .

		Serenely speaking in cold accents thus ' I know not , yet methinka 't was
Jupiter	ORGANIZATION	Went out of tune and spoilt the whole effect . ' ''

		The Celtic glamour is about the verse of Mrs. Cle - ment Shorter , although it does not have the effect of blurring the outlines of her thought as completely as with many other writers of the cult to which she belongs .

		Here is a pretty tribute to
Ireland	LOCATION	: '' Here he loosed from his hand A brown tumult of wings , Till the wind on the sea Bore the strange melody Of an island that sings . ''

		And here is a charming lyric : '' Little white rose that I loved , I loved ,
Roigin	PERSON	ban ,
Roitin	PERSON	ban / Fair my bud as the morning 's dawn .

		1 kissed ray beautiful flower to bloom , My heart grew glad for its rich perfume Little white rose that I loved .

Shorter	PERSON	has the instinct of balladry , and her most important pieces are cast in the narrative form .

		But these we must be content only to mention .

		The '' Fugitives '' of Miss
Winifred Lucas	PERSON	are the merest bits of verse , hardly any of them exceed - ing the compass of ten or twelve short lines . ''

		The Dream '' is here reproduced . ''

		Am I so bankrupt of delight I turn upon the stars for pain ?

		The happy stars that dream all night The dream I must not dream again ! ''

		Oh not until the stars to use The glory of my dream forbear , Its robe of light need I refuse As earthly , for myself to wear . ''

		The subtlety of suggestion here illustrated is char - acteristic of most of these fugitive expressions of single thoughts , and makes the pages of the slender book fit to be pondered over .

		Pictures of travel , from
Rome	LOCATION	to
California	LOCATION	, and impressions from those wider than terrestrial reaches that the soul knows in its trackless sojourns , are what we find in the '' Sea Drift '' of Miss Grace
Ellery Channing	PERSON	.

		The author would not be true to the name that she bears were her song not informed with the high ideals of thought and feeling for which
New England	LOCATION	has ever stood amid the breaking waves of a composite European influx , and she would be false to the best traditions of our race were she not to cherish the history of the island home whence our ancestors came .

		She sings : '' Who comes to
England	LOCATION	not to learn The love for her his fathers bore , Breathing her air can still return No kindlier than he was before ?

		In vain , for him , from shore to shore Those fathers strewed an alien strand With the loved names that evermore Are native to our ear and land . ''

		Who sees the English elm trees fling Long shadows where his footsteps pass , Or marks the crocuses that
Spring	DATE	Sets starlike in the English grass , And sees not , as within a glass ,
New England	LOCATION	's loved reflection rise , Mists darker and more dense , alas !

		Than
England	LOCATION	's fogs are in his eyes ? ''

		The more abstract and spiritual mood of Miss Channing 's verse may be illustrated by this extract from the beautiful poem , '' Pity , God . ''

		41 Pity thy dumb ones , God !

		thy speechless ones , Only whose tongues free aud unfettered are ; Whose lips the secret of the morning star Hath ne'er unlocked ; no winged word of fire , No fancy and no freedom , no desire Thrilled from the throat in song , stolen from the fingers In subtler speech which burns and glows and lingers .

		Through thousand forms wherein divinely wrought Into divinest life divinest thought Stands fashioned ; whom the Pentecostal flame Hath never touched ; in whom nor joy nor shame Nor liberty , nor truth 's self clearest shown Hath utterance stirred ; Nor the Beloved 's heart upon their own Wooed forth one whispered word ; Speechless , whose tongues speak only , make them whole , O God , unseal the dumb lips of their soul ! ''

		This satisfying and exquisite volume of verse tempts us to endless quotation , but the examples given above must suffice .

		The note is always a pure one , and not infrequently is enforced by harmonies of the rarer kind .

		The dominant spirituality of
Miss Channing	LOCATION	's song has just enough of sensuousness to keep it in touch with life , but not enough to dim the fine ether which is its natural element .

		Mrs. SewalFs '' Ode to Girlhood '' is a somewhat stiff and labored poem , in which imaginative flashes and prosaic details are quite curiously blent .

		Here is one section of the composition : 44 Wherefore so much beyond all need so fair ?

		Ye very tender are , And keep small animals to watch and feed , And would not jilt a beetle from his weed , And step around a resting butterfly With careful courtesy ; And from your passion-potent finger-tips , And long - prepared comfort of your lips , And shoulders hollowed for the weary man Since earth began , Ye nurse and heal whatever things ye meet , Then who can say ye need not be so sweet ? ''

		The infelicities of word and phrase are many in the poem from which this is taken , yet they are in part redeemed by touches of originality and a quite un - conventional treatment of the whole theme .

		An even more striking piece is called `` Youth , '' and thus begins : '' I am the spirit that denies .

		Yes , and with full-regarding eyes Comprehending the facts of earth 's sorrow and shame , And denying the truth of it just the same ; That takes man 's face in two palms soft , And looks deep into its brow and oft , Aud finds the good it has longed to find , And denies there is anything hidden behind . ''

		In some of Mrs.
Sewall	PERSON	's briefer lyrics there are suggestions , now of the quaintness of
Emily Dickin	PERSON	- son , now of the intimate religious feeling of
Christina Rossetti	PERSON	.

		Such a poem as '' How Love Came '' illustrates both of these features at once .

		The poems of Miss
Martha Gilbert Dickinson	PERSON	are of very uneven quality , at one time giving unexcep - tional embodiment of some happy conception , at another repelling by their confusion of imagery and forcing of the note . ''

		Benedicite , '' for example , would be a true poem were it not for the occasional jar of these intrusive elements .

		24-2 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, '' Tht waves in prostrate worship lie , and cease To count the pebble * on their rosary ; Over the scourged rocks a smile of peace Deepens the boshed expectancy .

		Each small , lost flower lifts her fragrant brow Forgotten flocks turn toward the rosy West ; Day drops her anchor off the world and now Awaits her shriving all her ways confessed .

		The patriarchal mountains stand apart .

		Far hills are kneeling ; birds arrest their flight Then the real Presence crowds all
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's heart , And benediction falls with night . ''

		We note particularly in this example , first , the fine figure , '' Day drops her anchor off the world , '' and the immediate appearance of the incongruous no - tion of '' shriving . ''

		The suggestion of the kneeling hills is forced , and the word '' crowds '' is infelici - tous .

		Why not say , instead , `` Then the real Presence thrills all Nature 's heart ? ''

		The most completely satisfactory of Miss
Dickin	PERSON	- son 's poems is the one called '' Summer 's Will . ''

		Here there is no confusion , and no straining for effect , but instead a single figure delicately and con - sistently worked out .

		`` These are the clauses of
Summer	DATE	's will To Autumn , a languorous haze to fill Valley and mountain with vague regret For her whose beauty they can not forget .

		To Mortals , maples whose colors dare Till scarlet Flamingoes seem nesting there ; Also a river woven in gold .

		Where willows murmur their stories old ; Treasures of golden rod , troops of corn .

		And sumach torches out-heralding dawn .

		To Heaven , lest day despair too soon .

		The silvery horn of her harvest moon .

		To Wondering Cattle , pastures green Rivalling
May	DATE	in their transient sheen ; All her black crows to the lonely Pines .

		To Straggling Fences , her madcap vines ; But to the Ocean only her tears , Tempests of parting and desolate fears .

		Sealed in witch hazel , filled in frost .

		To the witnessing winds ' t was all but tossed When she smiled a gentian codicil ' My love to the roadside under the hill ! ' ''

		Aside from its capricious capitalization , there seems no reasonable fault to be found with this charming poem .

		It is not our intention to make any contribution of our own to the discussion of that over-discussed poem , '' The Man with the Hoe . ''

		We have known Mr.
Markham	PERSON	as a poet for many years , and have held the sturdy vigor of his verse in high esteem .

		It is merely an inexplicable caprice of the public that has singled out this particular poem for extravagant laudation or censure , as the case may be , and has achieved for its writer a reputation that his previous years of work had not won for him .

		We wish only to say that in his assumption that society has made '' the man with the hoe '' what he is , there is a beg - ging of the whole question .

		We are rather inclined to think that men make themselves instead of being moulded by pressure from without , and that men with hoes and other useful implements play a proper part in the social economy .

		And we are also minded to quote a few apposite sentences from one of
Stevenson	PERSON	's essays . ''

		When our little poets have to be sent to the ploughman to learn wisdom , we must be careful how we tamper with our ploughman .

		When a man in not the beat of circumstances pre - serves composure of mind , and relishes ale and tobacco , and his wife and children , in the intervals of dull and unremunerative labor , when a man in this predicament can afford a lesson by the way to what are called his intellectual superiors , there is plainly something to be lost , as well as something to be gained , by teaching him to think differently .

		It is better to leave him as he is than to teach him whining . ''

		The popular success of Mr.
Markham	PERSON	's single poem has , however , had the excellent effect of bringing out a volume of verse which might other - wise never have seen the light , and which was cer - tainly worth printing .

		It is not alone in the titular poem that the author has elected to wear the prophet 's mantle , for the same plea for the oppressed and the same vision of a coming human brotherhood is the strain of most of his songs .

		The ideal is of the noblest , if here somewhat vaguely conceived , and we can not have too many poets for whom the message comes in such words as these : '' Go , be a dauntless voice , a bugle-cry In darkening battle when the winds are high A clear sane cry wherein the Qod is heard To speak to men the one redeeming word . ''

		In his '' Song to the Divine Mother , '' which is per - haps the finest of his poems , the passionate social - ism of the author achieves an expression that would not have been unworthy of
Morris	PERSON	.

		But for all the deep human feeling with which these songs of the '' Fraternal State '' are charged , we are bound to say that Mr.
Markham	PERSON	appeals to us more strongly when he forgets man and turns to the consolations of nature , or when , giving free rein to the imagina - tion , he has such a vision as this of '' The Wharf of Dreams . ''

		`` Strange wares are handled on the wharves of sleep : Shadows of shadows pass , and many a light Flashes a signal fire across the night ; Barges depart whose voiceless steersmen keep Their way without a star upon the deep ; And from lost ships , homing with ghostly crews .

		Come cries of incommunicable news , While cargoes pile the piers , a moon-white heap '' Budgets of dream-dust , merchandise of song , Wreckage of hope and packs of ancient wrong , Nepenthes gathered from a secret strand , Fardels of heartache , burdens of old sins , Luggage sent down from dim ancestral inns , And bales of fantasy from No - Man 's Land . ''

		a For the King , '' by Mr.
Robert Cameron Rogers	PERSON	, is a spirited irregular version of the story of the three mighty men of war who brought some water from the well of
Bethlehem	LOCATION	to
King David	ORGANIZATION	.

		Spirit , rather than finish , is the characteristic of most of the poems contained in this volume , as may be illus - trated by a stanza from the so-called lyric ode '' To
Spain	LOCATION	, '' a piece having for its ultimate object it might have had a worthier one the justification of our recent war .

		1899 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 243 '' We are not a warlike nation , Fashioned rather for keen trading .

		Some will say the style is English , That from them we get the cut East and West our ships went speeding , Decks awash from heavy lading , Bowsprits poked in every harbor , Never seeking quarrels , But When our rich Levant trade came and
Tripoli	LOCATION	claimed tribute from it , Tribute paid by other navies trading down the midland sea , We , the least and last of nations , blew her gunboats to Mahomet , Blew the faithful to their houris , made the Straits forever free . ''

		The conclusion of the argument thus pursued is that when we could no longer stand the conduct of our Spanish neighbor we proceeded to clean her out .

		Discrete silence is maintained concerning our sub - sequent adoption of Spanish methods as an outcome of this spasm of virtue .

		When he does not attempt to be stirring , Mr.
Rogers	PERSON	appears as a pretty ver - sifier upon the familiar themes of the minor poet .

		Bat he has done better work than is to be found in the present volume . ''

		An Epic of the Soul '' is an anonymous cycle of eighty short poems , all cast in a form which illus - trates a distinct novelty in versification .

		They de - pict the struggle for faith in the mind of the doubter , to which the spirit of mysticism comes at last to reconcile the conflicting currents of thought .

		We select the following two consecutive numbers , because they are fairly typical of the whole , and also because they show how easy is the descent from the plane of poetry to that of prose . ''

		Does God look down upon us from a star Careless of love or hate , of good or ill ?

		And will He send no shining avatar While man 's great spirit beats its prison-bar Longing to worship , and to know His will ? ''

		If He be but a great , impartial eye Expressionless , then let us creep and die , For we ourselves are more humane by far . ''

		Yet how can we submit to those inflictions At which the powers of reason grow satirical , Or pin our faith to any pleasing fictions , Though honest seeming , full of contradictions , Supported by the jugglery of miracle ? ''

		The story seems a beautiful invention The birth , the resurrection , the ascension And can it move the mind with deep convictions ? ''

		The author of these reflections is said to be `` known in more than one department of literature . ''

		We must say that it would be a slender reputation that could be enhanced by confessing the authorship of the present work .

		If Mr.
Madison Cawein	PERSON	would refrain from writing so much , or from printing so much of what he writes , his niche in the temple of our contemporaneous poetry would be more securely occupied .

		In such a case , he would suppress such hopeless verse as this : '' For , all around me , upon field and hill , Enchantment lies as of mysterious flutes ; As if the music of a god 's good - will Had taken on material attributes In blooms , like chords , '' Or as this : '' For he , of all the country-side confessed , The most religious was and happiest ; A Methodist , and one whom faith still led , No books except the
Bible	LOCATION	had he read . ''

		Is the author of these lines , sated with the inspira - tion of
Keats	PERSON	, now groping after the inspiration of
Wordsworth	PERSON	?

		We trust not , for the change would not be for the better .

		The strength of Mr.
Cawein	PERSON	lies in his sensuous interpretations of nature , in the attitude of passionate communicant rather than of high priest .

		We need not reiterate our often - expressed satisfaction with the best of his verse .

		The new volume , '' Myth and Romance , '' while in - cluding such passages as have been quoted , includes also many exquisite lyrics , none of them , perhaps , exceeding in beauty these stanzas inscribed to `` Youth . '' ''

		Morn 's mystic rose is reddening on the hills , Dawn 's irised nautilus makes glad the sea ; There is a lyre of flame that throbs and fills Far heaven and earth , with hope 's wild ecstasy , With lilied field and grove , Haunts of the turtle-dove , Here is the land of Love .

		`` The chariot of the noon makes blind the blue As towards the goal his burning axle glares ; There is a fiery trumpet thrilling through Wide heaven and earth with deeds of one who dares , With peaks of splendid name , Wrapped round with astral flame .

		Here is the land of Fame . ''

		The purple priesthood of the evening waits With golden pomp within the templed skies ; There is a harp of worship at the gates Of heaven and earth that bids the soul arise , With columned cliffs and long
Vales	LOCATION	, music breathes among , Here is the land of Song . ''

		Moon-crowned , the epic of the night unrolls Its starry utterance o'er height and deep ; There is a voice of beauty at the souls Of heaven and earth that lulls the heart asleep , With storied woods and streams , Where marble glows and gleams , Here is the land of Dreams . ''

		A poet of far wider renown than any Mr.
Cawein	PERSON	has yet achieved would not need to feel ashamed of these well-nigh faultless verses .

		Mr.
William Griffith	PERSON	is a bold man to venture upon '' A Litany of Nations , '' remembering what Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	has done with that theme .

		Here is one of the twelve quatrains , with the common refrain : ''
SWITZERLAND	LOCATION	. ''

		From mountains crowned with freedom , I repeat The skies ' great secret ,
Time	ORGANIZATION	's eternal quest Above the nations thundering at my feet And overlook the
West	LOCATION	.

		`` Mother of
Nations	ORGANIZATION	, as of yore Remember us and , near us Beseeching Thfe forevermore , Hear , O hear us ! ''

		, We like Mr.
Griffith	PERSON	better when the lofty mood is not upon him , and when he sings of the joys of vagabondage and the life of the open air .

		244 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, `` So , while the momenta slip and slide Prom
Winter	DATE	nnto
Spring	DATE	, With hedges flushing either side The country lanes , I bring AeroM the mart a foolish heart To hear the finches sing . ''

		In this poem , and many other * of like strain , the writer has caught the wilding note of such singers as Mr.
Bliss Carman	PERSON	and Professor
Roberts	PERSON	.

		To the two small volumes , dated
1887	DATE	and
1889	DATE	, of verse by the late
Edward Rowland Sill	PERSON	, the pub - lishers have now added '' a third and final volume , '' entitled ''
Hermione	PERSON	, and Other Poems . ''

		We have been in the habit of regarding Sill 's talent as a slender one , but in view of these three collections taken together , and the fact that even now much of his work remains uncollected , the opinion needs re - vision , for we are already in possession of some three hundred printed pages , and many a shining reputation has no more than that to its credit .

		We doubt if
Sill	ORGANIZATION	will ever have a shining reputation , for the rare purity of his note was such as to fall upon few ears fit to hear it , but we have no doubt that his work will be held as a precious permanent possession by an audience of whom any poet might be proud .

		Even our expectation that the present selection , coming after the two others , would prove inferior in quality , offering only the lees of his song , is not fulfilled , for we should hesitate to affirm that it was any less worthy of publication than either of its predecessors .

		The work that gives us such haunting phrases as `` yon dim ghost that
last night	TIME	was the moon , '' and that brings to rightly - attuned ears the message of '' All the holy hills and sacred waters ; When the sea-wind swings its evening censer , Till the misty incense hides the altar And the long-robed shadows , lowly kneeling , '' is work to be cherished in affectionate remembrance .

		And how ethically fine is the mood that speaks to us from the depths of spiritual experience in such verses as '' Tempted . '' ''

		Yes , I know what yon say : Since it can not be soul to soul , Be it flesh to flesh , as it may ; But is Earth the whole ?

		`` Shall a man betray the Past For all Earth -LRB- fives ? '

		But the Past i dead ? '

		At last , It is all that live * . ''

		Which were the nobler goal To snatch at the moment 's bliss , Or to swear I will keep my soul Clean for her kisa ? ''

		Here is an antidote indeed for the sensual cater - waulings of a host of bardlings who exalt the pas - sion of a moment to the rank of a Lord of Life .

		Although his biography is silent upon this subject , we know well from S ll 's verse that he felt the im - perious appeal of love , and suffered as such sensi - tive souls munt suffer when their ardors are spent in vain .

		The inner meaning is as clear in his love - lyrics as in those of the Swiss cycle in
Matthew Arnold	LOCATION	's volume .

		But the most typical expression of Sill 's outlook upon life , with all its dominant spirituality , is found in such a poem as that called '' Fertility . '' ''

		Clear water on smooth rock Could give no foot-hold for a single flower , Or slenderest shaft of grain : The stone must crumble under storm and rain The forests crash beneath the whirlwind 's power And broken boughs from many a tempest shock , And fallen leaves of many a wintry hour , Must mingle in the mould , Before the harvest whitens on the plain .

		Bearing an hundred-fold .

		Patience , O weary heart t Let all thy sparkling hours depart .

		And all thy hopes be withered with the frost , And every effort tempettt-tost So , when all life 's green leave * Are fallen , and mouldered underneath the sod , Thou shall go not too lightly to thy God , But heavy with full sheaves . ''

		Fated , like
Poe	PERSON	and
Lanier	PERSON	, to pass into an inher - itance of unfulfilled renown at an early age ,
Henry Timrod	PERSON	has been less fortunate than his compeers in posthumous favor .

		This is due , in part , to the fact that the
1873	DATE	collected edition of his complete poems became tied up through the bankruptcy of the publishers , and practically unobtainable .

		To present these poems once more to the public , and at the same time to establish a suitable memorial of the poet , a chartered association has been formed in
South Carolina	LOCATION	, and the first-fruits of its activity takes the form of a '' Memorial Edition , '' provided with memoir and portrait , and including a few pieces not heretofore collected .

		We are glad to have this volume , for
Timrod	ORGANIZATION	has been little more than a name to the reading public at large , and his poems deserve the place in every cultivated home in the
United States	LOCATION	, '' prophesied for them by
Longfellow	PERSON	a score of years ago .

		WILLIAM
MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		The huge and exhaustive work by I - S -
Bloch	PERSON	8aid to have g ' ven th Czar his notion of calling the Peace Conference which met recently at
The Hague	ORGANIZATION	, has now been translated in part by Mr.
R. C. Long	PERSON	, and appears before the American public with a long and valuable '' prefatory conversation '' with the author , reported by Mr.
W. T. Stead	PERSON	.

		The title though the present woik contains but one of the books , the sixth , of the original is long and cumbersome , but sufficiently apt : `` The Future of War in Its Technical , Economic , and Political Relations Is War Now Impossible ? ''

		-LRB-
Doubleday & MrClure Co	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .


M. Bloch	PERSON	concludes that it is impossible ; and the reader will agree with him in part and only in part , because , as he observes in relation to other things , he is advancing a theory , and war , unfortu - nately , is practice .

		He speaks , for example , of the
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 245 absolute impossibility , under certain conditions , of taking intreuchments ; yet the dismounted cavalry at
Santiago	LOCATION	did exactly what he sets forth as im - possible .

		The combination of a dynamite gun with a gatling battery one to unearth the foe , the other to slay him as he flees was unheard of and unthought of before the Americans used them , and overthrows some of the author 's best reasoned con - clusions .

		This being true , it is likely that future wars will be filled with similar surprises , only on a greater scale if
Europe	LOCATION	be the scene .

		But most of the conclusions at which
M. Bloch	PERSON	arrives outside of the actualities of battle , the effect of war upon the economic and political side of national life , have in them little of uncertainty and abundantly dem - onstrate the appeal to savagery to be not merely murderous but self-murderous to all who undertake it .

		How insane a thing a war is , and how its hor - rors react upon those who habituate themselves to them , is unintentionally displayed by the quotation given here from the lips of General Dragomiroff : '' The manoeuvres would be infinitely more valuable if one cartiidge in a thousand contained a ball . ''

		Humanitarians have welcomed all the accumulated disasters which modern science makes possible , as tending the sooner to do away with the thought of an appeal to arms .

		Great things are argued in this direction from the new rifles , with their increased velocity and decreased missile ; but the experience of the Americans now waging war upon the Fili - pinos makes the old-fashioned
Springfield	LOCATION	with smokeless powder cartridges the more effective weapon in comparison with the Krag-Jorgensson .

		On the other hand , the large proportion of officers slain in recent wars has had the effect of leaving
Germany	LOCATION	without a war party among professional soldiers , since an outbreak of hostilities virtually signs the death-warrant of every man with shoulder straps .

		One thing the author makes quite plain the uselessness of a large navy unless it is to be in some sense or another '' supreme . ''

		The ethical argument against war has no part in the scheme here , hot blood being notably hotter than cool words are refrigerating ; yet the economic argument , that war in the future will become a question of starva - tion at home , comes to the same thing .

		Civilized society has learned individually that violence leads to nothing but disorder ; but the lesson is yet to be learned by nations .

		America , lately an exemplar for lovers of peace , has become as veritable a swashbuckler as the rest ; but we are not yet set in the broad path that goes down to death .

		This book should aid us in leaving it .

		Mr.
Herbert E. Hamblen	PERSON	's '' Yarn of Dubinin yarnt T > - i tr / c < * u \ of sailor Hje .

		a Bucko Mate -LRB- Scnbner -RRB- is in - ferior to his capital book u On Many Seas , '' chiefly because the author has , in his pres - ent venture , gotten out of his true literary element .

		Mr.
Hamblen	PERSON	's forte is the literal narration of his own unusually interesting and varied experiences as sailor and as '' railroad man . ''

		But in the pres - ent volume he largely eschews fact and tries his hand at fiction .

		The result is distinctly disappoint - ing , the more so because Mr.
Hamblen	PERSON	's former books were so good .

		The '' Yarn '' the strictly imaginative part of it at least is not much better than the sort of thing served up in the dime-novel , and a good deal of it must be pronounced coarse and deleterious stuff .

		We do not think the com - mon sailor is the degraded ruffian , the abject bully and blackguard , that the reader of Mr.
Hamblen	PERSON	's extravaganza may fairly infer him to be .

		In fact , we know he is not .

		There is no handier , cleanlier , braver , kindlier , and , according to his lights , hon - ester man than the American sailor ; and he will not thank Mr.
Hamblen	PERSON	for portraying him as phy - sically a hog and morally a
Yahoo	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Hamblen	PERSON	's opening chapters , which appear to be founded on fact , are not so bad ; but even here there is too much ruffianism , too much of the low side of mar - itime life and character .

		Even the '' Bucko Mate '' who spins the '' Yarn '' is a confessed brute , bully , and cut-throat , whose supposed redeeming trait is the harboring of some sloppy sentiment about '' Rose 's boy and mine . ''

		The opening chapters are , as we have said , fairly good , and depict life as it was on the scandalous old
Black Ball	ORGANIZATION	packets with some degree of literal truth .

		After that comes the fiction shooting , stabbing , gambling , robbery , piracy , battle , murder , and sudden death .

		A treas - ure buried on a
Pacific	LOCATION	it-land furnishes the motif of the closing chapters .

		Mr.
Hamblen	PERSON	's book will not lack readers ; but we trust he will return to his last , and give us something next time worthy of himself .

		A new book on an old worthy .

		No one can deny that Mr.
Augustine Jones	PERSON	, in his '' Life and Work of
Thomas Dudley	PERSON	, the second Gov - ernor of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
MifHm & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , shows careful reading of his souices , and much zeal and patience in selecting and bringing together facts relating to that worthy .

		Not so much can be said for his literary method .

		He has imbedded in the connecting tissue of his narrative a great num - ber of quotations , generally good quotations , some selected because they convey facts and some because they convey opinions .

		Many of these quotations , as well as other matter , are repeated , occasionally more than once .

		The total result is a book that contains a large amount of solid information , but in a style cumbrous , heavy , and not attractive .

		Perhaps in these particulars the book is in some measure a symbol of its hero .

		Mr.
Jones	PERSON	's secondary object in preparing the book , unless indeed it is the primary one , is to clear the name of Dudley of the old charge of bigotry and intolerance . ''

		We indulge the hope , '' he says , ' that the thoughtful reader will conclude with us that an injustice has been done to the memory of an excellent man , who cordially wel - comed truth from every source . ''

		That will depend , we imagine , upon the reader 's point of view .

		The author has shown very conclusively that the Gov - 246 TIIK DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, ernor bad a thorough understanding of the ideas on which the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	was founded , that he believed thoroughly in those ideas , that he committed his life and fortunes to the attempt to realize them , and that he wrought , suffered , and sacrificed in the effort to realize them .

		He entered deeply into the religious and political life of the colony from
1630	DATE	, the time of the great emigration , to
1653	DATE	, the time of his death , holding perhaps a variant view here , and urging a different practice there , hut on the whole in accord with the main stream of thought , feeling , and action .

		We see no reason to put him in a category by himself .

		He stands or falls with the Puritans of
Massachusetts Bay	LOCATION	.

		The author says
Dudley	PERSON	'' was as liberal in religion and politics as the public sentiment of his age allowed , '' and '' was not then regarded as intol - erant , '' which is , generally speaking , true as re - spects his environment ; but when the author says nothing beyond this can be required , '' and that '' the judgment of his neighbors and peers is the only reasonable one , '' he raises again the question of point of view .

		These Massachusetts Puritans , upon the whole , were liberal and tolerant beyond their time ; much can be said to show that they permitted as much liberty of thought and action as was safe , considering the condition of the colony ; but this leaves unanswered the important and diffi - cult question of the relation of the idealist to so - ciety , or of the prophet to the practical statesman .

		We shall not enter upon a discussion of this subject , but merely throw out the question whether
Roger Williams	PERSON	and men like him have any real mission in the world , and if so , what it is .

		It is very evi - dent , for one thing , that they are a different class of men from the Dudleys , good as the Dudleys are in their place .

		The mechanical make-up of the book is excellent , and the illustrations of early scenes in
Dudley	LOCATION	's life are admirable .

		Besides recapitulating the events and glancing at the protagonists of the remarkable political drama that closed with the Tenth of Thermidor , Dr. Jan Ten Brink 's ''
Robespierre	LOCATION	and the Red Terror '' -LRB- Lip - pincott -RRB- is an intelligent and impartial study of the character and motives of the arch fanatic whom
Napoleon	PERSON	styled the `` scapegoat of the Revolu - tion . ''

		Dr. Ten Brink 's estimate of
Robespierre	LOCATION	does not differ essentially from that of Mr.
John Morley	PERSON	whose masterly essay ought to be in the hands of every student of the period .

		Robespierre was a zealot who shed blood like water to bring about his Utopia .

		But the old notion that he shed blood merely for the sake of shedding it is a vulgar error .

		He sent his victims to the scaffold , as Philip II .

		sent his to the stake , with the best intentions in the world .

		The French bigot aimed to effect the reign of virtue , justice , and felicity on earth ; the Spanish bigot meant to do God service and to save mankind from the pit .

		We rightly abhor the errors of both ; but we are not to lose sight of the Robftpierre , '' tcaiyoat of the Revolution . ''

		quality of their motives , and thereby mins the lesson of their lives .

		Potential Robespierres , fanat - ics burning to try their nostrums on society , we have with us in plenty to-day ; and if the French Revolution teaches us anything of practical value , it is the peril of putting these '' saviors of society '' in a position to wreak their theories on us unre - strained .

		We are glad to note that Dr. Ten Brink includes a chapter on
Robespierre	LOCATION	's youth and early manhood , a period of his life that throws much light on his character , and is too often unconsidered by his critics and delineators .

		History affords no more curious psychological study than the evolution into the inexorable author of the bloody Law of 22nd Prairail of the harmless young sentimentalist of
Arras	LOCATION	, who sang madrigals and sipped rose-water with the ''
Rosatis	PERSON	, '' who wept for days over the death of a pet pigeon , and who threw up a judicial post in a fit of remorse after sentencing a murderer to the gallows .

		Dr. Ten Brink 's style is easy and discursive , and he makes no flourish of philosophi - cal profundity or novelty of view .

		The book is well adapted to popular reading , and contains some interesting portraits and reproductions of old prints .

		It should be added that the author is a professor at the
University of Leyden	ORGANIZATION	, and that his translator , Mr.
J. Hedeman	PERSON	, has done his work well .

		A famout maker of anthologitt .

		The brilliant circle of English liter - ary men which has made our gener - ation famous , and has included such men as
Tennyson	LOCATION	,
Browning	PERSON	,
Gladstone	LOCATION	,
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	,
Hallam	PERSON	,
Newman	PERSON	,
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	,
Shairp	PERSON	, and
Clough	PERSON	, has suffered sad depletions within the
last decade	DATE	.

		Friendly hands have been prompt to gather and publish the scattered memorials of these great ones , and '' Life and Letters '' have become a very popular though somewhat sad feature of recent lit - erature .

		One of the best known and best beloved within that charmed circle , although not one of the most conspicuous as seen from the outside , wtit
Francis Turner Palgrave	PERSON	, the story of whose life , as presented by his daughter , largely through the medium of diaries , letters , and tributes of friends , makes a highly interesting addition to our knowl - edge both of the man himself and of his generation .

		As private secretary first to Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	and after - wards to
Lord Granville	LOCATION	, as art critic to the Sat - urday Review , '' as Professor of Poetry for ten years at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, and the author of several books in prose and verse , Palgrave is shown to have been a man of singularly varied gifts .

		But it was in the capac - ity of compiler that his greatest public service was rendered , and the one by which he will be longest remembered .

		The '' Golden Treasury of Songs and Lyrics '' was published first in
1861	DATE	, and was rec - ognized from the beginning as the best existing anthology of its kind .

		Without doubt , this little book has taught many , in all ranks of life , to know and love much of our best lyrical poetry which other - wise might have remained to them obscure and neglected .

		Shortly before his death , in
1897	DATE	, a
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 247 `` Second Series '' was added , in order to include gems written in the thirty-six years since the first collection was made .

		A '' Child 's
Golden Treasury	ORGANIZATION	'' was another of this interesting series of anthologies , all displaying the most correct and refined taste , and seeming to elevate the humble role of compiler almost to the dignity of original or creative work .

		The volume is published handsomely by Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and a fine portrait head of Professor Palgrave forms the frontispiece .

		The lives ^ tnose wno prefer their history in of twelve the form of biography , as well as to great soldiers .

		military men , the volume entitled '' From Cromwell to
Wellington	LOCATION	, '' edited by Mr.
Spenser Wilkinson	PERSON	-LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , will furnish good reading .

		The dozen careful studies embraced in its five hundred pages are , with one exception , writ - ten by army officers , and consequently show no lack of technical knowledge of campaigns and battles .

		The influence of Captain
Mahan	PERSON	's writings is , we be - lieve , discernible in the emphasis which the book lays upon sea power as an all-important element in the military history of the British Empire .

		A second lesson which it teaches , as pointed out in the intro - duction , is the necessity of
England	LOCATION	's maintaining a thoroughly efficient army to take advantage of her naval superiority .

		Disarmament finds no word in its favor in these pages .

		The overlapping of some of the lives as in the case of
Baird	LOCATION	,
Moore	PERSON	, and
Wellington	LOCATION	makes this form of history not the most economical of space , although it serves admir - ably to emphasize the personal element .

		The lit - erary excellence of the book , as a whole , is perhaps a shade less conspicuous than some of its other merits ; nor could it well be otherwise .

		It is hard for a writer to give a short sketch of
Wolfe	LOCATION	, for example , which shall be wholly satisfactory to ad - mirers of the man as he is seen in the pages of
Parkman	LOCATION	and
Thackeray	PERSON	; or to trace an outline of
Cromwell	ORGANIZATION	's career that shall do him justice in the estimation of readers of
Carlyle	LOCATION	.

		The portraits in the book are good process prints , and the maps and plans are numerous , well drawn , and helpful to the understanding of the text .

		Lugubrious 20th century After a series of most terrific wars in which both the Christian and Mos - lem ^ rids are involved , the Rev.
H. Periera Mendes	PERSON	, in his '' Looking Ahead : Twen - tieth Century Happenings '' -LRB- Neely -RRB- , finally gets the Jews safely installed in
Palestine	LOCATION	.

		The author is the pastor of the Spanish and Portuguese Con - gregation in
New York City	LOCATION	, which will in part ex - plain what may seem to others to be an anti-climax .

		But even a most conscientious attempt to put one 's self in the Rev. Mr.
Mendes	PERSON	's place fails to elicit from the situation in any of its details quite the satisfaction one is sure he intended to have felt at the denouement .

		The book is a prophecy of the occurrences likely to fall during the next century .

		They show a human being in control only a little less savage than our palaeolithic ancestors , and vastly more destructive .

		We sincerely hope the Rev. Mr.
Mendes	PERSON	is wrong about everything except the settlement of his co-religionists in the land they took so unceremoniously from the
Philistines	LOCATION	in days gone by .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Among the hundreds of critical essays written by English and American scholars for the '' Library of the World 's Best Literature , '' there are many of great value , which deserve to reach a wider public than that made up of owners of the complete work .

		The Dou - bleday
& McClure Co.	ORGANIZATION	have just made a selection of these essays , and published it in a four - volume set of small books styled '' The
Warner	ORGANIZATION	Classics . ''

		We find here Mr.
Lecky	PERSON	's
Gibbon	PERSON	, Mr.
Stephens	PERSON	's
Carlyle	LOCATION	, Dr.
Garnett	PERSON	's
Emerson	LOCATION	, Mr.
Warner	PERSON	's Byron , Mr.
Norton	PERSON	's Dante , Mr.
James	PERSON	's
Hawthorne	LOCATION	, Mr.
Trent	PERSON	's Balzac , Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	's
Thackery	PERSON	, Mr.
Hutton	PERSON	's
Newman	PERSON	, Mr.
Shorey	PERSON	's Plato , and perhaps a dozen others .

		The essays are classified , one volume containing poets , another novelists , another historians and essayists , and another philosophers and scientists .

		We have received from
Messrs. Luzac & Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Lon	LOCATION	- don , a volume of '' Oriental Wit and Wisdom , '' being the '' Laughable Stories '' collected by Mar
Gregory John Bar-Hebrseus	PERSON	, an ecclesiastical dignitary of the thirteenth century .

		The translation is from the Syriac text , previously published by the Messrs.
Luzac	PERSON	, and is made by Mr.
E. A. Wallis Budge	PERSON	, of the British Museum .

		These '' laughable stories '' are upwards of seven hundred in number .

		The following is a fair ex - ample : '' Another man had a pain in his stomach , and being asked the cause thereof , he said : I have eaten largely of a little milk and it hath done me harm . ' ''

		The wit is not exactly side-splitting .

		Occasionally , an anecdote is too frank for our ears , and is turned into discreet Latin instead of English .

		`` State Trials , Political and Social '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the title of a work in two small volumes edited by Mr.
H. L. Stephen	PERSON	.

		The text consists of an account of ten famous trials , and includes lengthy extracts from the actual proceedings of the court .

		These extracts are taken from the reports of the
Howells	LOCATION	, father and son , while the editor has supplied the necessary intro - ductions and connecting links .

		The most interesting subjects are
Raleigh	LOCATION	,
Charles I.	PERSON	, the Regicides , the
Suffolk Witches	LOCATION	, and
Alice Lisle	PERSON	.

		There is a fascina - tion about these circumstantial records of which pro- fessional historians rarely catch the secret , and students of English history will do well to make the acquaint - ance of this work .

		`` The
Treatment of Nature	ORGANIZATION	in the Poetry of the Roman Republic , '' by Miss
Katharine Allen	PERSON	, is a doc - tor 's dissertation of the
University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	, and is published as a bulletin of that institution in the series devoted to '' Philology and Literature . ''

		It is a painstaking piece of work , with illustrative examples carefully classified , and , although the subject has frequently before been handled , the present wiiter appears to have conducted an independent investigation .

		The monograph extends to over one hundred pages , of which Lucretius comes in for nearly one-half , as it is entirely proper that he should .

		There are several illustrations .

		The
Duubleday & McClure Co.	ORGANIZATION	have just published three new volumes in their series of '' Little Master - pieces , '' as edited by Mr.
Bliss Perry	PERSON	.

		Thackeray , De Quincey , and Lamb are the respective subjects of these neat booklets .

		A new biographical series , to be known as '' The Sock and
Buskin	PERSON	Biographies , '' is announced by
Messrs. Richard G. Badger & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first volume will be devoted to Miss
Julia Marlowe	PERSON	, and will be written by Mr.
John D. Barry	PERSON	.

		Miss
Kate M. Warren	PERSON	's version of '' Piers Plowman '' in modern English is a useful little book for beginners in the study of our literature , and we are glad to note that it has gone into a second edition -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which has had the benefit of many suggestions from Professor
W. P. Ker	PERSON	.

		A recent bulletin of the
Field Columbian Museum	ORGANIZATION	describes several new species of plants , among them a genus which has been named
Higinbothamia	LOCATION	, after a well-known citizen of
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		Since it belongs to the
Uioseoreaceje	LOCATION	, the new plant seems to be a kind of yam .

		It comes from Yucatan .

		Messrs.
T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have just published an attractive illustrated edition , in two volumes , of
George Eliot	PERSON	s '' Middlemarch , '' distinguished , like the other publications of that house , by neatness and inexpen - siveness .

		This edition comes in a box .

		The thirteenth volume in Mrs.
Garnett	PERSON	's excellent translation of the novels of Tourgue * nieff -LRB- Maomillan -RRB- includes `` The Diary of a Superfluous Man '' and four of the other short stories .

		Two more volumes of short stories are yet to follow , and the edition will then be complete .

		The
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	has begun to reissue the '' New English Dictionary '' in monthly parts of eighty-eight pages each , at
ninety cents	MONEY	a part .

		This means a cent a page , and the entire work will extend to about 12,500 pages .

		It is expected that ten yean more will be required for its completion .

		`` Manders , '' that charming novel by Mr.
Elwyn Bar	PERSON	- ren , the English edition of which was reviewed by us a year or so ago , has just been republished in this country by
Messrs. L. C. Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and we bespeak for it a cordial reception .

		It is much the best piece of literary work that Mr.
Barron	PERSON	has thus far done .

		The
University of Virginia	ORGANIZATION	will celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's death on the seventh of this month by unveiling a bust of the poet in the library of the
University	ORGANIZATION	.

		The occasion will be one of great intrrot , and visitors from many parts of the country will doubt - leu respond to the invitation to be present .

		1 ` oe is distinctly a `` live '' subject at present , and his place among our greatest writers becomes every year more and more firmly assured .

		Messrs.
Curts & Jennings	PERSON	are the publishers of a `` Life of the Seventh Karl of Shaftesbury , '' by Miss
Jennie M. Bingham	PERSON	.

		The book gives us a simple and interesting account of how the famous philanthropist abolished child slavery in the mining regions of En - gland , how be shortened the hours of labor in the factories , ` and threw the broad shield of British law over the heads of hundreds of thousands of working people . ''

		Eleven new volumes are this year added by
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	to their popular '' Faience '' edi - tions of favorite books .

		No less than seven of this num - ber are American classics recently out of copyright , works by
Hawthorne	LOCATION	,
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Holmes	PERSON	,
Curtis	PERSON	, and
Thoreau	LOCATION	.

		The others are Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's '' Barrack-Room Ballads , ''
M. Rostand	PERSON	's `` Cyrano , '' Jean de la Brete 's '' My Uncle and My Curd , '' and Souvestre 's '' Attic Philosopher . ''

		Clough was never a popular poet , and it is a little startling to receive at the same time four different new editions of his poetical works .

		A brief inspection of the volumes , however , clears away the mystery , for they all come from the same publisher -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , and are all paged alike .

		They are , in fact , the same book with certain variations in their binding and other me - chanical details .

		There is an excellent memoir , and the price is low .

		It is extremely doubtful if Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	's autobiog - raphy will ever be completed ; but possessors of the incomplete third volume will be able to make up that volume , probably .

		Mr.
Allen	PERSON	, the publisher , is pre - paring with this object a new edition of '' Dilecta '' -LRB- which consists of notes supplementary to the autobi - ography -RRB- .

		Some unpublished material intended by Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	for this latter work will be included , to - gether with a comprehensive and elaborate index .

		The '' Copley '' series is the title given to a new col - lection of works of standard literature now in course of publication by
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The distinctive feature of this series is provided by the col - ored illustrations which adorn them .

		Eight volumes have now been published , as follows : ''
Cranford	LOCATION	, '' by Mrs.
Gaskell	PERSON	; ''
Prue	PERSON	and I , '' by
George Will	PERSON	- iam Curtis ; '' The
House	ORGANIZATION	of the Seven Gables , '' by
Hawthorne	PERSON	; '' The Abbe Constantin , '' by
M. Hale	PERSON	` vy ; ''
Lucile	PERSON	, '' by ''
Owen Meredith	PERSON	'' ; ''
Barrack	PERSON	- Room Ballads , '' by Mr.
Rudyard Kipling	PERSON	; and
Longfellow	PERSON	's '' Evangeline '' and '' Hiawatha . ''

		The '' What is Worth While '' series of white cov - ered booklets published by
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	is prettier than ever this year with its columbine decorations .

		Nineteen new numbers of this series have just been issued , and their contents are of varied inter - cut , ranging from M. Brunetiere 's lecture on ' - Art and Morality '' to '' Cheerfulness as a Life Power , '' by Mr.
O. S. Marden	PERSON	.

		Two or three of the more serious titles are `` The Artistic Ordering of Life , '' by Dr.
Albert S. Cook	PERSON	; `` The Choice of a College for a Boy , 1 ' by Dr.
C. F. Tbwing	PERSON	; and '' The Trend of the Century , '' by President Low .

		283 THE NEW PATRIOTIC IMPULSE .

		A great deal has been said , during the past year , about the rekindling of American patriot - ism that has resulted from the war with
Spain	LOCATION	and its sequelce .

		We are once more a united people , and we stand together in the defence of the national honor , and new glories have been won for the American flag , and we have taken our proper place among the great powers , and our manifest destiny has again declared itself in the impressive deeds by which the triumph of our arms has been accomplished .

		The changes have been rung upon all the familiar phrases of political oratory , gold and pinchbeck alike , and flamboyant boastings from every quarter of the land have convinced men only too wil - ling to be persuaded that our feet were indeed planted upon '' glory-crowned heights . ''

		The emotions to which explosive vent has been given are , no doubt , sincere enough to deserve a cer - tain measure of respect , even from those who know how hollow in reality the most resonant phrases may be , and how recklessly the political rhetorician will indulge in sentiments to which the whole tenor of his career gives the lie .

		But thinking men have never been content , in
America	LOCATION	or elsewhere , to accept at their face value the counters of the politician .

		As was recently said in '' The Nation , '' '' in the case of such men , the proposed sentiments of human - ity and morality really count for nothing at all .

		They regard them merely as mouth-filling phrases , which sound well and please their con - stituents ; and never dream that they will one day return to plague them , or that anybody will think of holding them to their own pro- fessions . ''

		And whether such sentiments come from some high official like the war-lord of
Albany	LOCATION	, or from the most servile henchman of a political party having at bottom no nobler motive than party advantage and no higher aim than plunder , their ring is false , and will de - ceive only those who wish to be deceived .

		The new patriotic impulse to which we here wish to call attention finds no illustrations in the noisy plaudits of those who din daily into our ears the catchwords of duty and destiny the duty of advancing civilization by fire and sword , the destiny which may only be asserted by denying to alien peoples the fundamental 266 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, rights of man .

		Rather do we hear through all this din the accents of a still small voice recall - ing to us that our true duties lie close at hand , and that the national destinies wrought out for us by
Washington	LOCATION	and
Jefferson	PERSON	and Lincoln are absolutely incompatible with our new - fangled dreams of empire .

		And because this voice , which is no other than the voice of the national conscience , has not breathed out its protest unheeded , but has found so many fear - less spokesmen , filled with passion for the ideals that all true Americans have cherished hitherto , and thrilling with indignation at the present desecration of those ideals , it has seemed to us that this new manifestation of the spirit of the finer patriotism is a most noteworthy phenom - enon , not to be paralleled more than two or three times in the whole course of our history .

		In behalf of this protest against the abandon - ment of the principles by which our moral stature as a nation has hitherto been deter - mined , there has been enlisted , in the words of ex-Governor
George S. Boutwell	PERSON	, '' an array of names such as has not been brought together in support of a common cause since the signing of the Declaration of Independence . ''

		So many are these names , and so great is their influence as leaders of both thought and action , that we shall not attempt the invidious task of singling out a few for special mention .

		A score or more of them will occur at once to the mind of any well-informed reader , and every fair critic must admit that they represent an overwhelmning preponderance of the intelligence and morality of our fellow-citizens .

		The attempt of a time-serving press to attach to these names the stigma of treason is one that falls with the weight of its own absurdity .

		This position is exactly that of
Chatham	LOCATION	and
Burke	PERSON	in opposing another war of subjugation over a hundred years ago .

		It is for the courage of their attitude in resisting a perverse and short - sighted colonial policy that those men are held in the highest honor by Englishmen and Amer - icans alike .

		The verdict of history metes out even justice to the men who in any age with - stand the outbursts of popular folly ; and who can doubt that , in our own present case , when '' the tumult and the shouting dies , '' the lead - ers who now , at no small cost of temporary popularity , stand for the principles of the Fathers of our Government , and speak for ' the mighty hopes that make us men '' in a sense unknown to European history , will be adjudged by no remote posterity to have won for themselves a crown of exceeding great glory .

		Whatever may be the outcome of the struggle to preserve for this nation the ideals upon which its true grandeur has been based whether our ship of state reach its haven or suffer shipwreck the honor of these men is secure .

		They have fought the good fight , and history will set them high among the heroes of our race .

		In a certain sense , the judgment of history is already pronounced .

		What history says of any age is determined largely by what the most forceful minds of that age have said of its issues .

		The men who are to-day speak - ing to us with the authority of experience and ripened political wisdom are the men to whom the historian of the future will turn for light , just as we now turn for light upon the history of our Revolutionary struggle to the living words of
Burke	PERSON	and
Chatham	LOCATION	, of
Washington	LOCATION	and
Jefferson	PERSON	.

		These considerations bring us to the more special subject of the present discussion .

		We Americans have a great wealth of political lit - erature , for our bent toward the discussion of problems of statecraft is as marked as was that of the Athenians .

		Much of this literature is mere volubility , and whatever heat it once had has long since become dissipated .

		But the best of this literature is still a living force , for it deals with the most vital features of our polity , and its interest remains perennial .

		When we survey the cherished masterpieces of our polit - ical writing its eloquent oratory and its calm intellectual appeal we find that they centre about two great themes the struggle for independence and a national union , and the struggle to preserve that union and make it stand for freedom in the largest meaning , for the equality of all men in the sight of the law .

		It is this latter aspect of the secular conflict which now again confronts us , and the cause at issue makes upon us a demand no less im - perious than the demand that was made upon an earlier generation by the harsh pretensions of the English crown , and upon a later one by the arrogant pretensions of the slave-owning oligarchy .

		He must be blind indeed who does not see that the same essential principles are now again at stake , and that the outcome of the present deplorable situation is fraught with the same enormous possibilities for good or for evil .

		In this serious condition of affairs , our writers have not been found wanting , and it is with the deepest satisfaction that we call attention to the way in which they have risen to the high occasion offered them .

		There is growing up about the present subject of contention a mass
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL of literature which is conceived in accordance with the noblest traditions of American thought .

		Even in mere bulk it is already almost com - parable with the literature inspired by oppo - sition to the institution of slavery , and in quality it is no whit inferior , either in its impassioned earnestness or in its deep resolve to maintain to the death those standards of justice and human right that so many seem now to be weakly forsaking .

		The thought which infuses all this writing is indeed that which '' Bade our fathers ' souls to live , And bids the dying century bloom anew . ''

		It is the thought of men too sturdy in their Americanism to be swept away from their moorings by the gusts of partisan folly , and too sure that they are right to be influenced by any array of hostile numbers .

		It is the thought of men each one of whom would be content to stand with serene conscience an Aihanasius contra mundum , each one of whom would re - echo the ''
Ultima Verba	PERSON	'' of
Victor Hugo	PERSON	, `` Sans cherchera savoir et sans considerer Si quelqn ` un a pli6 qu'on aurait era plus f erme , Et si plusieurs s ` en vont qui devraient demeurer . ''

		The defenders of our latter-day imperialism have not yet come to understand the temper of this opposition to their reckless course .

		They treat it as a difference of opinion , but it is nothing of the sort .

		Men may have opinions about such matters as the tariff and the cur - rency , but the proposition to cast aside the doctrines of the Constitution and the
Declara	LOCATION	- tion , the counsels of
Washington	LOCATION	and
Lincoln	LOCATION	, the sanctions of free government that have been inculcated upon Americans from their earliest childhood this proposition runs counter to the most sacred convictions of all men to whom Americanism is more than an empty name .

		Let us enumerate a few a very few of the writings that have responded to this wild onslaught upon the principles that make the American name dear to us .

		There are the lectures and addresses contained in President
Jordan	PERSON	's `` Imperial Democracy , '' a volume which is a complete arsenal of fact and argu - ment .

		There are such papers as `` The Present Crisis , '' by
Edwin D. Mead	PERSON	; `` Our Nation 's Peril , '' by Dr.
Lewis	PERSON	G.Janes ; `` Imperialism , and the Tracks of Our Forefathers , '' by Mr.
Charles Francis Adams	PERSON	; `` England in
1776	DATE	:
America	LOCATION	in
1899	DATE	, '' by Mr.
William M. Salter	PERSON	; and '' The Conquest of the
United States	LOCATION	by
Spain	LOCATION	, '' by Professor
William G. Sumner	PERSON	.

		There are such speeches as that of Senator
Hoar	PERSON	in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, of Mr.
Carl Schurz	PERSON	before the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, of Professor
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	at the
Ashfield	LOCATION	Dinner .

		There are such fugitive writings as the `` Open Let - ter '' from ex-Senator
Henderson	PERSON	, and `` The Philippine Piracy , '' by Professor
William James	PERSON	.

		There are innumerable other contri - butions to this literature of protest and warn - ing , offered by such men as President Eliot , Professor von Hoist ,
Bishop Henry C. Potter	PERSON	, Bishop
John L. Spaulding	PERSON	, Professor
Felix Adler	PERSON	, and the Rev.
Henry Van Dyke	PERSON	.

		Now , of all this literature it is not enough to say that it can not be ignored .

		Much of it is so admirable in form , besides being suffused with the lasting qualities of fine intelligence and exalted emotion , that it is sure of preserva - tion among the most noteworthy examples of American patriotic eloquence .

		The future student and compiler of such literature will be justified in placing Senator
Hoar	PERSON	's speech of last
February	DATE	beside
Webster	PERSON	's reply to
Hayne	PERSON	, and Professor Sumner 's Phi Beta Kappa ad - dress beside the finest efforts of his great name - sake .

		One reads these masterly productions with the same glow of feeling that is inspired by the traditional models of our eloquence , and the youth of the future will take from them the same contagion of enthusiasm which our gene - ration has caught from their old-time pro- totypes .

		Their present value is that they strengthen our faith in the potency of our cherished ideals , and bid us take heart for our country however dark the present outlook .

		What to the faint-hearted may seem one sweep - ing degringolade of principles and institutions can not , after all , be a reality as long as such voices as these are raised to recall us to the old paths of national virtue and sobriety . ''

		This spasm of folly and delusion also , in my judg - ment , will surely pass by , '' are among the closing words of Senator
Hoar	PERSON	's memorable speech .

		And what true American should not be proud to echo the words that follow : '' Whether it passes by or not , I thank God I have done my duty , and that I have adhered to the great doctrines of righteousness and freedom , which I learned from my fathers , and in whose service my life has been spent . ''

		Such a literature as this makes us almost glad that the occasion for it has arisen .

		The awakening from our fancied security has been rude , and the perils to which we are exposed have become imminent ; but we now know , at least , that the voices that were raised in past crises of our national life have found worthy successors , and that the torch has been handed on still aflame .

		The poets , indeed , we sadly 268 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, miss , for we know with what prophetic fire our
Whittier	LOCATION	, were he now alive , would arouse our sluggish conscience , and our
Lowell	PERSON	scourge with the scorpion whip of his indignation the traduoers of our national character .

		But the words of the poets have this advantage over all common words , that they apply to other times and places than those by which they are immediately occasioned , and neither '' Ichabod '' nor the ''
Biglow	PERSON	Papers '' could in reality be bettered for our present needs .

		What , in fact , could a
Lowell	LOCATION	now say that would be more exactly to the point than these familiar stanzas , and the note by which they are supplemented : '' We were gittin * on nicely up here to oar village , With good old idee * o 1 wut ' right an * wot aint , We kind o ' thought Christ went agin war an ' pillage , An ' thet eppyletts wor n't the best mark of a saint ; Bat
John P. Robinson	PERSON	he Sex this kind o 1 thing * s an exploded idee . ''

		The side of oar country mast oilers be took , An 1 President Polk , yoa know , he is oar country .

		An * the angel that writes all oar sins in a book Puts the debit to him , and to us the per contry ; And
John P. Robinson	PERSON	he Sex this is his view o ' the thing to a T. '' '' Our country is bounded on the north and the south , on the east and the west , by
Justice	ORGANIZATION	, and when she over - steps that invisible boundary-line by so much as a hair 's - breadth , she ceases to be our mother , and chooses to be looked upon quasi noverca .

		That is a hard choice when our earthly love of country calls upon us to tread one path and our duty points us to another .

		We most make as noble and becoming an election as did Penelope be - tween Icarius and
Ulysses	PERSON	.

		Veiling our faces , we must take silently the hand of Duty to follow her . ''

		THE STUDY OF ENGLISH IN
GERMANY	LOCATION	.


Germany	LOCATION	has done more to promote the critical study of English than the whole Anglo-Saxon race besides .


Hanover	LOCATION	, by reason of her political rela - tions with
England	LOCATION	, and of the rich literary gifts that
Goettingen	ORGANIZATION	received from
London	LOCATION	, made the start .

		The first German professor to take an interest in English was
Hof rath Reuss	PERSON	, the
Goettin	PERSON	- gen
University	ORGANIZATION	librarian , who in
1770	DATE	published a book on the living writers of the British Isles and
America	LOCATION	.

		Somewhat later
Boutewek	PERSON	, a
Goettingen	ORGANIZATION	professor of philosophy , wrote a work on Middle and Modern English literature .

		But greater than the influence of these two professors was that of the celebrated scholar
C. Heyne	PERSON	, perhaps the most distinguished philologist of his day .

		His influence , however , was not direct , bat indirect He pre - pared the way by applying the methods which have made modern philology so important a factor in uni - versity work .

		Heyne 's successor was
Benecke	PERSON	, who became a
Goettingen	ORGANIZATION	professor in
1805	DATE	, and shares with
Lachmann	PERSON	the honor of having made
Germany	LOCATION	acquainted with the poets of the first golden age of German literature .

		Although professor of German , his lectures on Spenser and
Shakespeare	PERSON	and his crit - ical work in Middle English show him to have been well informed in both English literature and English philology .

		His students were so eager to learn En - glish that they did not object to meet their professor as early as six o'clock in the
morning	TIME	.

		The next important German scholar of English was
W. A. von Schlegel	PERSON	, whose translation of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is one of the best in any language .

		Since his day , neither the German Goethe nor
Schiller	PERSON	heads the long list of dramatists whose works constitute the repertoire of the royal theatres of
Germany	LOCATION	, but the English Shakespeare .

		Schle - gel 's epoch-making lectures on dramatic art , which brought him a call to the newly founded university of
Bonn	LOCATION	, were directly translated into English , and were made by
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	, sometime student of
Goettingen	LOCATION	, the basis of a new Shakespearian criti - cism .

		From the time of
Schlegel	PERSON	to
1872	DATE	, which may be considered the beginning of the present import - ant period of the study of English in
Germany	LOCATION	, most of the professors who worked particularly with literature gave their time to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first of this long list of critics is
Huber	PERSON	, well known as author of '' English Universities . ''

		In the thirties he lectured in
Marburg	LOCATION	on Shakespeare ; and in the forties he delivered in
Berlin	LOCATION	, to which University he had been called , the first course of German lectures ever delivered on Chaucer .

		Near the close of
the first half of this century	DATE	there appeared Gervinus 's great work on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, a work which first applied the methods that character - ize German critical contributions to English litera - ture .

		Other names worthy of mention here are
Hattner	PERSON	,
Herrig	LOCATION	,
Keller	PERSON	,
Vischer	PERSON	,
Rapp	PERSON	,
Wolf	LOCATION	,
Ulrici	LOCATION	, and Flathe , all of whom gave more attention to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	than to any other English author .

		The father of German as well as of English philology was
Jacob Grimm	PERSON	.

		His grammar , which appeared in
1819	DATE	, may be regarded as one of the greatest contributions to modern philology .

		Al - though the first important contribution to Teutonic philology , its fourth volume , '' Teutonic Syntax , '' remains to-day the only comprehensive work on the subject , and will hold its place until the appear - ance of
Roethe	PERSON	's new edition of the same and the completion of
Wilmann	ORGANIZATION	's German grammar .

		Pro- fessor
Schmid	PERSON	of
Jena	PERSON	studied
Grimm	PERSON	's grammar five years , and then published , in
1832	DATE	, the Old English Laws . ''

		The long list of professors who based their investigations on the results of
Grimm	LOCATION	worked with Old English in general and '' Beowulf '' in particular .

		The most important of this list are
Leo	PERSON	and Ettmueller , well known to scholars of En - glish philology .

		Somewhat later , we have
Grein	PERSON	,
Muellenhoff	LOCATION	,
Delius	LOCATION	,
Maetzner	PERSON	,
Koch	PERSON	, and
Heyne	ORGANIZATION	.

		Of these six celebrated philologists , all of whose works are indispensable to-day , Dr.
Heyne	PERSON	, pro-
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 269 fessor of Teutonic philology at
Gottingen	LOCATION	, is the only one living .

		His valuable text-books in several of the Teutonic languages have made him as famil - iar to the American and English student of modern philology as he is to the German student .

		Until
1872	DATE	, English literature and English phi - lology were separate .

		A professor gave his time either to the one or the other .

		It would be difficult to find a man who made valuable contributions to both .

		Then , too , English philology and literature were combined either with Teutonic philology and literature or with
Romance	ORGANIZATION	philology and literature .

		In
1872	DATE	Strassburg was opened and the first chair of English was endowed .

		The other larger uni - versities followed , and to-day nearly all the German academic institutions have chairs of English .

		In
1873	DATE	Ten Brink was called from
Marburg	LOCATION	to
Strassburg	LOCATION	, where he filled the chair of English until his death , five years ago .

		Ten Brink and his great contemporary Zupitza -LRB- who began as classical philologist and '' Germanist , '' and held the chair of English in
Berlin	LOCATION	from
1876	DATE	to
1895	DATE	, the year of his death -RRB- did more to advance the study of English than any other German scholars .

		Many well-known philologists in
Germany	LOCATION	, as well as in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, owe the inspiration they received to these two men .

		Ten Brink did the Anglo-Saxon race a great service by his import - ant contributions to English criticism , and
Zupitza	ORGANIZATION	will be remembered as one of the great scholars in Old and Middle English .

		Zupitza was the first German to assist the
Early English Text Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		Important contemporaries of these two men were Barnay , EIze , Mall , and
Schipper	PERSON	.

		The past decade marks a great period in the German study of English .

		German scholars are applying to English , more assiduously than ever , the methods that have made German what it is .

		The men who are doing the English work to-day are Wuelker and
Sievers of Leipsic	ORGANIZATION	,
Brandl	PERSON	of
Berlin	LOCATION	,
Schipper	PERSON	of
Vienna	LOCATION	, Morsbach of
Goettin	PERSON	- gen ,
Koeppel	PERSON	of
Strassburg	LOCATION	,
Trautmann	PERSON	of
Bonn	LOCATION	, Koelbing of
Breslau	LOCATION	,
Sarrazin	PERSON	of
Kiel	ORGANIZATION	, and
Victor	PERSON	of Marburg .

		Of these scholars ,
Sievers	PERSON	and Mors - bach are the greatest philologists .

		The former 's Old English grammar and the latter 's Middle English grammar , have revolutionized the study of the first two periods of English philology .

		Trautmann and
Vietor	PERSON	are particularly known because of their work in phonetics .

		Sarrazin ,
Koeppel	PERSON	, and
Brandl	PERSON	have made very important contributions to English criticism .

		Schipper is the greatest authority on English metre .

		Wuelker as editor of '' Anglia '' and Koelbing as editor of '' Englische Studien '' have worked in both English philology and English literature .

		Both
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	learned from Ger - many how to study scientifically their mother tongue , and it is a pleasing fact that
Germany	LOCATION	is making such rapid progress in her investigations in the greatest of modern languages and richest of modern literatures .

		E. I. ANTRIM .

		MEMOIRS OF AN AMERICAN CITIZEN .

		* The name of
John Murray Forbes	PERSON	is not so familiar to his countrymen at large as it ought to be , or as it would be had his great public services been coupled with official position .

		The part played by Mr.
Forbes	PERSON	in public affairs , especially during the period of the Civil War , was an important and effective one ; but he never held , nor sought , political office .

		What he did for his country he did as a private citi - zen , and in the most private way possible ; his maxim being , '' Never mind who does it or gets the credit for it , so long as the thing is done . ''

		Political ambition can hardly , in a republic , be accounted an alloy in the motives that impel a man to serve his country ; but it is , never - theless , always refreshing to meet the rarer , or at least seemingly rarer , brand of patriotism that neither voter nor tax-payer is ever ex - pected to requite or pay for .

		It was as a pioneer and manager of Western or Middle - Western railroads that Mr.
Forbes	PERSON	was best known to the American public .

		He was one of the founders of each of those great lines , the
Michigan	LOCATION	Central and the
Chicago	LOCATION	,
Burlington & Quincy	ORGANIZATION	.

		Of the latter company he was president from
1878	DATE	to
1881	DATE	, and he was one of its directors from
1857	DATE	until his death , in
October , 1898	DATE	.

		The earlier years of Mr.
Forbes	PERSON	's business career were spent in
China	LOCATION	.

		In
1837	DATE	he returned finally to
America	LOCATION	, and established himself at
Boston	LOCATION	as a mer - chant in the
China	LOCATION	trade .

		In view of his sub - sequent field of commercial operations , a letter of his -LRB- 1836 -RRB- as to railway investments is amusing .

		`` The principal object of the present is to request that you will by no means invest any funds of mine in railway stocks , and to advise you to keep clear of them .

		I have good reasons to believe , from all I can learn of the English railways , that ours will prove a failure after the first few years ; the wear and tear proves ruinous .

		At any rate , keep clear of them . ''

		Ten years later we find Mr.
Forbes	PERSON	embarking cautiously on his first railway venture the purchase , with several copartners , among them
Erastus Corning	PERSON	, from the
State of Michigan	LOCATION	of its quarter-built road -LRB- the germ of the future
Michigan	LOCATION	Central -RRB- at
seventy-five cents	MONEY	on the dollar .

		Writing in
1884	DATE	of these early opera - tions , Mr.
Forbes	PERSON	says : * LETTEKS AND RECOLLECTIONS OF JOHN MURKAT FORBES .

		Edited by his daughter ,
Sarah F. Hughes	PERSON	.

		In two volumes , with portraits .


Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		270 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, '' Like a young bear , with all my troubles before me , I had plunged into the railroad vortex , aud on
June 11 , 1847	DATE	, I find by my letter-books that I was at
Milwau	LOCATION	- kee with the other
Michigan Central	ORGANIZATION	directors , we having decided to take our road round to
Chicago	LOCATION	, instead of trusting to
New Buffalo	LOCATION	and water carriage on the lake for our Western outlet .

		It was oo this trip that
W. B. Ogden	PERSON	drove us about
Chicago	LOCATION	and tried to coax us into rapid action by offering us land in that city , for which he was the selling agent , at low prices .

		The land below the harbor on the lake was then a sand-drift and might have been bought very low , but the cheapest purchases would have been the wet prairie lands within a mile of the hotel where we stopped , which were offered ns at
$ 1.25	MONEY	per acre .

		Sheltered by our absurd preju - dices against laud , we were proof against
Ogden	PERSON	's seductions , and I do not think any of us ever bought a foot of land in
Chicago	LOCATION	for ourselves while the road was in course of construction .

		My hotel bill of
8125	DATE	would have bought 100 acres , now worth 98,000,000 to
$ 12,000,000	MONEY	. ''

		In
1852	DATE	Mr.
Forbes	PERSON	, still busy with the
Michigan Central	ORGANIZATION	, and also with the small roads forming the embryo of the future Chi - cago ,
Burlington	LOCATION	and
Quincy	PERSON	, had undertaken the '' very trying enterprise of building the Hannibal and St.
Joseph	PERSON	road , to connect the
Mississippi	LOCATION	and
Missouri	LOCATION	rivers . ''

		Possibly too intent , up to
1856	DATE	, on the management of the
Michigan	LOCATION	Central -LRB- the presidency of which he resigned in
1857	DATE	-RRB- , Mr.
Forbes	PERSON	does not seem to have foreseen the impending financial crash of
1857	DATE	, largely due to the overbuilding of Western railroads .

		About the middle of Sep - tember the storm struck
Boston	LOCATION	, as may be gathered from Mr.
Forbes	PERSON	's letter to a foreign correspondent ,
September 28 , 1857	DATE	. ''

		We are in such a crisis here as only those who went through
1837	DATE	can conceive of .

		...
New York Central	ORGANIZATION	has run down from 87 to 55 , and
Michigan	LOCATION	Central from 95 to 45 , while the weaker concerns are clear out of sight Erie 10 ,
Southern Michigan	LOCATION	10-15 .

		Having taken in sail , not expecting a storm , but out of pure laziness , I am very easy unless other people swamp me . ''

		In the following month Mr.
Forbes	PERSON	went to
London	LOCATION	and secured a loan , on onerous terms , of
two million dollars	MONEY	to fend off the threatened bankruptcy of the
Michigan	LOCATION	Central .

		His own view of the policy which had gotten the road in straits was as follows : '' Somehow the directors had taken the view that the high rates for money in the streets were only tempo - rary ; and so for the needful construction and other outlays they had allowed the company to incur a heavy floating debt instead of selling stock and bonds to meet their outlays . ''

		The
Michigan Central	ORGANIZATION	shortly afterward passed into
New York	LOCATION	hands , and Mr.
Forbes	PERSON	sold out his interest therein at a very moderate profit , his real gain being that fund of ex - perience which was to prove so valuable to the then rapidly developing
Chicago	LOCATION	,
Burlington	LOCATION	and
Quincy	PERSON	road .

		As a manager of great business enterprises , Mr.
Forbes	PERSON	was well char - acterized by a former partner in
China	LOCATION	. '

		He never seemed to me a man of acquisitiveness , but very distinctly one of constructiveness .

		His wealth was only an incident .

		I have seen many occasions when much more money might have been made by him in some business transaction but for this dominant passion for building up things .

		The good , also , which he an - ticipated for workmen and settlers through opening up the country always weighed much with him . ''

		Mr.
Forbes	PERSON	's absorbing interest in politics began and grew with the slavery controversy .

		Prior to
1850	DATE	he was a Whig .

		But in that year
Webster	PERSON	's Fugitive Slave Law speech gave a sharp turn to the current of his political thought , and he gave up his old party , becom - ing a Republican , or '' Free-Soiler , '' with abo - litionist leanings , which , with the progress of the war , took shape in his ardent and effective advocacy of the emancipation measure .

		In
1859	DATE	he entertained over night at his
Milton	PERSON	home a notable visitor none other than
John Brown	PERSON	of
Ossawattomie	LOCATION	, already under the ban of the law and of a large and violent section of opinion .

		Mr.
Forbes	PERSON	's account of his guest is interesting .

		Captain
Brown	PERSON	was a grim , farmer-like looking man with a long gray beard and glittering gray-blue eyes which seemed to me to have a little touch of insanity in them .

		I did all I could to draw the old mau out and make him talk , first politics and then about bis adventures in
Kansas	LOCATION	.

		He repelled , almost with scorn , my suggestion that firmness at the ballot - box by the North and West might avert the storm ; and said it had passed the stage of ballots , and that nothing but bullets would settle it now ... Leading him back into
Kansas	LOCATION	by asking him about the battle of Ossawat - tomie , he replied , in his jerky way of throwing out his words , ` That was n't any battlel 't was all on one side ' ; and then he told me that on that day he had been roused by having his son killed by the
Missouri	LOCATION	border ruffians , and another son dragged at their horses ' heels all day in the sun , until he was nearly frantic ; he had raised a small force -LRB- I think only thirty -RRB- to watch the invaders , and perhaps get a chance to strike a blow at them .

		Waiting on the edge of a large swamp , through which he could at any time retreat , be saw the enemy coming along careless and confident . '

		How many , Captain Brown ? '

		` Wai , they said there was 270 of them . '

		When they were at close range his little band poured in a volley , and they completely lost their heads , while be repeated the attack .

		At last they realized how small the Free-Soil force was and made a serious at - tempt to attack it , and then Captain
Brown	PERSON	just scuttled off through the swamp without much or any loss . '

		How many did you kill ? '

		we asked . '

		Wai , they said we hurt seventy of 'em . '

		... The Captain had to go to town by the earliest train ... When our parlor girl got up early to open the bouse , she was startled by finding the grim old soldier sitting bolt upright in the front entry , fast asleep ; and when her light awoke him
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 271 he sprang up and put his hand into his breast-pocket , where I have no doubt his habit of danger led him to carry a revolver . ''

		Some six months later came
John Brown	PERSON	's capture at
Harper	PERSON	's Ferry and its tragic sequel .

		As a presidential Elector - at - large , Mr.
Forbes	PERSON	signed the certificate of his
State	ORGANIZATION	's election of Lincoln in
1861	DATE	.

		What he then thought of the successful candidate appears in a letter to Mr. Senior . ''

		From such of them -LSB- Lincoln 's speeches -RSB- as I have read , I get the idea that he is an earnest , rough , quick - witted man , persistent and determined , half educated , but self-reliant and self-taught ... Those who know him assure me that he is honest and straight-forward and owned by no clique of hackneyed politicians . ''

		How late it was before
Lincoln	PERSON	's greatness was really recognized even by those who thought and acted with him politically , we know ; and let us turn here , as to an interesting freak of contemporary opinion , to an extract from a letter -LRB- 1862 -RRB- from Mr.
W. P. Fessenden	PERSON	to Mr.
Forbes	PERSON	, which now reads , in the light of the easy wisdom that comes after the event , almost like a sort of blasphemy .

		`` You can not change the President 's character or conduct , unfortunately ; he remained long enough at
Springfield	LOCATION	, surrounded by toadies and office-seekers , to persuade himself that he was specially chosen by the Almighty for this great crisis , and well-chosen .

		This conceit has not yet been beaten out of him , and until it is , no human wisdom can be of much avail . ''

		An interesting opinion of
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	and his policy is found in a letter to Mr.
Forbes	PERSON	-LRB- 1883 -RRB- of the former Assistant Secretary of the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	, G. V. Fox . ''

		His playing with ' peace negotiations ' in
1864	DATE	was a repetition of that profound and secretive policy which marked his course with regard to
Fort Sumter	LOCATION	in
1861	DATE	.

		Many of the leaders , even those close to him , thought him to be a < simple-minded man . '

		He was the deepest , the closest , the cutest , and the most ambitious man American politics has produced . ''

		While Mr.
Forbes	PERSON	seems not to have quite appreciated or done justice to Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	's character and abilities , he nevertheless worked hard for his reelection in
1864	DATE	; and apropos of this fact a characteristic anecdote , contrib - uted by Mr.
Edward Atkinson	PERSON	, may be given . ''

		At Mr.
Forbes	PERSON	's instance a meeting was called for the purpose of raising money for the second Lincoln campaign .

		It was held in a large side office , of which I had the control .

		Some fifteen or twenty men came in .

		After the hour had been reached , Mr.
Forbes	PERSON	sug - gested to me to lock the door , and we looked around the meeting .

		He said , ' How much is this meeting good for ? '

		I replied , ` About twenty thousand dollars . ' '

		Well , ' said he , do n't unlock the door until we have got it . '

		The matter was discussed , and in his usual manner he led off with a large subscription , and before we unlocked the door we had
twenty-three thousand dollars	MONEY	.

		He always led on any line that he thought others should follow . ''

		It is impossible to specify fully here the many good works done by Mr.
Forbes	PERSON	for the cause he had so deeply at heart during the war .

		Head , hand , and purse , he was always at the service of his country .

		He was Governor
Andrew	PERSON	's unofficial right-hand man and confi - dential adviser , taking for a time full charge of the work of moving , feeding , and clothing the
State	ORGANIZATION	troops .

		He was active in organizing the
Sanitary Commission	ORGANIZATION	, and in enlisting the colored troops a measure which he strongly urged upon the Government as the logical and expedient sequel of emancipation .

		He wrote and inspired leaders in the press , and was tireless in the work of disseminating right views of the cause and the aims of the North , both at home and abroad .

		He was in close touch and constant correspondence with the heads of the departments at
Washington	LOCATION	, who sought his advice chiefly in matters of shipping and finance .

		It is hardly too much to say that he was for a time virtually an unofficial or ad - visory member of Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	's cabinet .

		His philosophy of the war was , as may be gathered from a letter to Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	in
1863	DATE	, that it was fundamentally a struggle , a phase of the historic and enduring struggle , between aris - tocracy -LRB- or , better , oligarchy -RRB- and democracy , the originators and natural supporters of seces - sion , the planting aristocracy and its economic parasites , numbering in the insurgent States about 28,000 persons , out of a total of 5,000,000 persons .

		Said Mr.
Forbes	PERSON	: '' The next great want is to get the public mind of the North , and of such part of the South as you can reach , right upon the true issue of the existing struggle .

		... Our friends abroad see it .


John Bright	PERSON	and his glorious baud of English republicans see that we are fighting for democracy : or -LRB- to get rid of the technical name -RRB- for liberal institutions ... Our enemies , too , see it in the same light .

		The aristocrats and the despots of the Old World see that our quarrel is that of the people against an aristocracy ... My suggestion , then , is that you should seize an early opportunity to teach your great audience of plain people that the war is not the North against the South , but the people against the aristocrats ... Let the people North and South see this line clearly defined between the people and the aristocrats , and the war will be over . ''

		In
1863	DATE	Mr.
Forbes	PERSON	was sent by the
Federal Government	ORGANIZATION	to
England	LOCATION	with instructions to block -LRB- through private negotiations -RRB- the pro- gress or change the destination of the cruisers then notoriously building in English shipyards for the use of the Confederacy .

		Credits to the amount of 1,000,000 sterling were placed at his disposal , and these he was to use largely at 272 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, his own discretion .

		Mr.
Forbes	PERSON	failed , as we know , to purchase or to secure a lien upon the cruisers , according to his specific mandate ; but that his representations to prominent English - men that the sailing of the rams -LRB- as Mr.
Adams	PERSON	put it -RRB- meant war '' between the
United States	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	eventually went far in accomplish - ing the main end aimed at , there is good evi - dence .

		While in
England	LOCATION	Mr.
Forbes	PERSON	, it ap - pears , wrote a private letter to Mr.
Rathbone	PERSON	, a leading Liverpool merchant and member of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, explicitly stating that if the
Laird	PERSON	rams sailed war would ensue .

		What followed is related by Mr.
Rathbone	PERSON	in a letter of
1898	DATE	.

		I went straight up to
London	LOCATION	, saw Mr.

		They realized at once the danger of the crisis , and urged me to see Lord
Palmerston	LOCATION	.

		I was perfectly astonished at the ignorance of our statesmen generally , and of
Lord Palmerston	LOCATION	in particular , as to the inevitable effect a maritime war would have on a commerce like ours ... I was able to meet all Lord
Palmerston	LOCATION	's remarks and suggestions from information that had come to my knowledge as a shipowner and a very close student of laws bearing upon the state of our mercantile marine .

		... He said he quite realized the importance of the facts I had laid before him , and listened with very great patience ; and when I had concluded , asked me whether there were any other points which I wished to suggest .

		I said I thought I bad laid before him suf - ficient to show that the sailing of the < rams ' meant war with
America	LOCATION	and the destruction of our mercantile marine .

		Three days afterwards the ' rams ' were stopped , and purchased by the government ... And I have always believed that the Messrs.
Forbes	PERSON	's letters and Mr.
John Forbes	PERSON	's previous exertions in favor of peace prevented a war between the two countries . ''

		Acknowledging Mr.
Forbes	PERSON	's services , after the termination of his mission to
England	LOCATION	, Secretary Welles wrote : `` Generously refusing all compensation for your per - sonal services , you in a great emergency promptly , and with much inconvenience to yourselves , * entered with alacrity upon the mission confided to you , and the de - partment has reason to be satisfied with the intelligent and judicious manner in which its duties were dis - charged . ''

		The foregoing quotations may perhaps serve to measurably justify the length at which Mr.
Forbes	PERSON	's career is set forth in the two well - made and impeccably printed volumes from which they are taken .

		As to the origin and elements of the volumes , a word must now be said .

		They consist largely , as the title implies , of Mr.
Forbes	PERSON	's correspondence with public men on public questions at a very critical period of the nation 's history .

		They thus pos - sess an interest apart from and perhaps superior Mr.
W. H. Atpinwall	PERSON	WM Mr. ForWs able and patriotic colleague in the English mission .

		to their biographical interest .

		The light they occasionally shed on the characters of public men of the day , and especially on the opinions that public men of the day had of each other 's characters , is decidedly useful .

		The autobio - graphical element of the work has been culled by the editor , Mr.
Forbes	PERSON	's daughter and the custodian of his papers , from `` a couple of vol - umes of reminiscences of his life '' composed twelve years ago .

		The editor , who has done her work throughout in a workmanlike and tactful way , supplies a graceful and touching introductory chapter on her father 's habits and characteristics . ''

		I publish these things , '' she adds at the close of the preface , as the record of an American citizen who , keeping himself in the background , never stinted work , or money , or service of any sort , for the country he loved so well . ''

		The impression to be gained from these volumes of the sterling character of this genial and public-spirited citizen forms a valuable acquisition for any man . ''

		He was , '' as his friend
Emerson	PERSON	said of him , an Ameri - can to be proud of . ''

		THE DIAL 273 of composition suited to the needs of pupils of all grades , while the numerous editions of English classics which , thanks to modern pedagogy , every publisher of school-books is sending out , for every age and condition , will furnish any variety of interesting themes and material for composition .

		The study of English grammar must , from the nature of the subject , be analytical .

		It is a study of relation , mainly of function .

		The sentence as a whole is known and understood long before the pupil is able to grasp the gram - matical relation of its parts ; he must , there - fore , proceed from the whole to its parts , and this is the analytic method .

		In the study of Latin grammar or the grammar of any foreign tongue , the process is just the reverse ; the pupil proceeds from the parts to the whole , because it is easier to comprehend the part than the whole , and the synthetic is , of course , the right method .

		It is poor pedagogy that would confound the two things .

		In the study of En - glish there is plenty of '' constructive work '' to be done outside of the grammar .

		The author is undoubtedly right when he says : '' The time has gone by when the study of English grammar is condemned by thought - ful teachers ... No other study can take its place . ''

		Only , we would insist that it be gram - mar , and not something else in grammar cloth - ing .

		The grammatical part of this book proceeds in an orderly way as far as page 52 , when it is interrupted by the insertion of two or three pages on Letter Writing , and is again resumed on page 55 .

		If the book were intended for the use of American schools in
the Philippines	LOCATION	, the following paragraph would seem to be more pertinent . ''

		How do letters get to the persons for whom they are intended ?

		Why are they put in envelopes ?

		Why must they be stamped ?

		What is the value of the stamp placed on an envelope ?

		Where is it put ? ''

		But as the author assures us in the Preface that the book '' is intended to meet the require - ments of high schools , normal schools , and academies , '' we suggest that some such instruc - tion as this would be more to the point : Always enclose a stamp except in love-letters .

		Do n't lick the corner of the stamp and stick it to the sheet of paper on which you write .

		The enlightened do n't do that .

		After folding your letter put the stamp in loose .

		No person accustomed to receiving letters will let it escape on opening the letter .

		If you have only two stamps and are writing to your teacher for your grades or a testimonial , do n't reserve one of the stamps in order to thank your teacher .

		That is unnecessary .

		Drop the stamp in your first letter , in which you may express your thanks in advance .

		The government has not yet ex - tended the franking privilege to teachers , and Boards do not furnish stamps .

		But to return to the grammar .

		It would be quite impossible to point out all the errors ; that would require another book .

		We must content ourselves with a few samples here and there .

		Under '' Verbals used as adjectives , '' two examples will suffice : `` 2 .

		A soldier lay dying .

		3 .

		The slate used for roof - ing houses is a kind of stone . ''

		Under '' Verbals used as Adverbs '' : '' 3 .

		Hearing a noise , I looked around . ''

		Comment is unnecessary .

		`` 271 .

		Some clauses have only two essential parts , the subject and the predicate .

		They are called abridged clauses .

		Examples .

		I desire him to go .

		Spring having come , all nature is clothed in beauty .

		Let him go . ''

		This seems to be entirely original . ''

		In construing hers in ' This book is hers , ' supply book .

		In construing yours in ` Yours is lost , ' ` This is yours , ' supply possession or property . ''

		Old-field teachers of grammar , if there are any left , will be delighted with this reversion to grammar in its rudimentary stage .

		One of the special features of the work to which attention is invited in the Preface is : ' 9 .

		The treatment of the objective case . ''

		Turning to the Objective Case -LRB- p. 149 -RRB- , we find this startling statement : '' Nouns and pronouns that modify verbs , verbals , adjectives , and adverbs are called the objects of the words that they modify . ''

		As this will be unintelligible to many readers , an illustration is here given from another part of the book : `` Ago .

		` She died eleven years ago ' ; adv. -LRB- Years , a. o. of ago -RRB- .

		He staid till a few minutes ago ' ; obj .

		of till .

		-LRB- Minutes , a. o. of ago . -RRB- ''

		The reader may like to know that a. o. stands for adverbial object .

		Returning now to p. 157 , we read : '' Rule 7 .

		A noun or a pronoun used as the adverbial object of a verb , a verbal , an adjective , or an adverb , is in the objective case . ''

		Here is another dash of originality , unintel - ligible , to the reviewer at least : '' In ' The Cretans were believed to be liars , ' the form of were believed is determined by the subject of the abridged clause .

		Cretans may therefore be called the subject of were believed , though it is not the entire subject . ''

		274 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, What is lacking ?

		And where is the clause ?

		Any pupil who has passed into the high school should know it is the predicate , rather than the subject , that is made complete by the infinitive phrase .

		Now let us turn to the author 's treatment of Mood , the crucial test of the grammatical ama - teur : '' Mood is a variation in the use and form of a verb to show the manner in which an act or state is expressed with reference to the person or thing represented by its subject . ''

		This is a little disappointing after the author 's positive assurance of '' the accuracy and sim - plicity of the definitions . ''

		`` There are six moods : the indicative , the sudjunctive , the potential , the infinitive , and the participial . ''

		The author evidently does not intend to be out - done by anybody . ''

		A verb in the indicative mood is used in expressing a fact . ''

		It would have been nearer the truth to say : A verb in the indicative mood is used in express - ing a falsehood ; as no sane man ever tells a lie in the subjunctive mood .

		Mood has no more to do with fact than with tact , not so much ; and whoever confounds mood with fact has not the faintest conception of mood . ''

		The fact may sometimes be referred to as a doubt ; as , ' If
Saturn	ORGANIZATION	is large ,
Jupiter	ORGANIZATION	is larger . ''

		A logical conditional , in which there is no shadow of a doubt , any more than in '' If he is breathing , he is living . '' ''

		A verb in the potential mood is used in expressing power , permission , possibility , compulsion , duty , inclin - ation , or a wish .

		Examples .

		< I can go , ' etc. '' This will rejoice the heart of the few veterans who still linger on to do battle for their cher - ished '' potential . ''

		Mood is confounded this time with the meaning of the verb .

		Whatever potentiality there is lies in the meaning of can , with which mood has nothing to do .

		In '' I doubt the truth of the statement , '' doubt is ex - pressed , to be sure , but the mood is indicative .

		But why stop with the '' potential '' ?

		If mood has to do with the meaning of the verb , why not make other categories , and extend them indefinitely ?

		For instance , we might call I will go '' the volential mood , '' I beg you to go '' the deferential mood , '' I am sorry I went '' the penitential mood , and so on .

		There would be no limit to this sort of thing , and it might serve as a useful exercise in invention , just as in the case of the author 's participial mood , which , so far as we know , is entirely original .

		But granting the potentiality of can go , what is there potential in would go , should go , etc. ?

		For illustration , let us take three examples of the use of would : -LRB- a -RRB- .

		He would tell , if he knew -LRB- diceret ... tciret -RRB- .

		-LRB- 6 -RRB- .

		He would tell the same joke every year -LRB- nar - rabat -RRB- .

		-LRB- c -RRB- .

		He would not tell -LRB- nolebat dicere -RRB- .

		Now any grammatical instruction that con - founds these three uses of would , to go no fur - ther , is simply pernicious , and utterly useless as a discipline . ''

		A verb in the present tense of the imperative mood refers to future time ; as , Charge ,
Chester	PERSON	, charge . ''

		We fear that , if Chester so understood the use of the imperative mood , the battle was lost to
Marmion	PERSON	. ''

		Sometimes the subject -LSB- of the imperative mood -RSB- is in the first or the third person ; as , Cursed be I that did so .

		Shak .

		Come we , who love the Lord .

		Watts .

		Thy kingdom come . ''

		It is no secret that all these verbs are in the subjunctive mood .

		This surely must have got under the head of Imperative Mood by mis - take .

		What the good old Doctor Watts really did say was '' Come ye that love the lord . ''

		He used the imperative .

		The other is perfectly good English , corresponding to the Latin ven - iamus and the German kommen wir , but it is known to grammarians as the subjunctive .

		The imperative mood always has the second person for subject . ''

		A few intransitive verbs are sometimes used in the passive form , though they are not in the passive voice ; as , ' The melancholy days are come , ' ' He it fallen , ' -LRB- 666 , note -RRB- . ''

		On referring to the note , we learn that this is ** a French idiom . ''

		If it be necessary to go outside of English to explain English grammar , why not call it a German idiom ?

		Ours is a Germanic , not a Romance , tongue , and it is the regular construction in German .

		But this happens to be an English idiom , coming down to us from Anglo-Saxon by direct lineal de - scent .

		In another part of his book the author informs us gravely that English grammar is now a grammar of modern English , and not Latin or Greek .

		It is largely controlled by the grammar of Anglo-Saxon , '' etc. .

		This is very useful information , and it is true , but there is one English grammar that is evidently not '' controlled '' by Anglo-Saxon .

		If the author 's knowledge of English had been under such control , we should not find , for one thing , in - cluded among Prefixes of Anglo-Saxon Origin : u En , em , in , im -LRB- to , into , to put into -RRB- ; as , engrave , enchant , '' Romance additions to the Anglo-Saxon stock .

		1899 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL ' 275 Under '' Miscellaneous Notes '' there is dis - played throughout a good deal of originality .

		Only a few specimens can be given here : '' Little . '

		Little older ' ; adv. A little older ' ; noun . ''

		`` Both .

		` He is both rich and lucky ' ; adv. -LRB- 966 , note 2 -RRB- . ''

		This note reads : '' The correlatives both , either , and neither are adverbs of emphasis , modifying the two parts of the sentence joined by the conjunctions that follow . ''

		If the incredulous reader should demand more positive proof , he may find it on page 254 : `` Adverbs of emphasis are used to render other words more emphatic .

		They may modify nouns , pronouns , verbs , adjectives , adverbs , verbals , phrases , clauses , or sentences .

		In I , too , am sick , ' / is emphasized , and hence modified .

		In I am sick , too , ' sick is made em - phatic .

		In ' I am too sick , ' too is an adverb of degree .

		In ' Both winds and waves swept it , ' both modifies winds and waves .

		Neither modifies just and kind in ` It was neither just nor kind . '

		Both and neither in such construc - tions are usually called conjunctions -LRB- 966 , note 2 -RRB- . ''

		Of course , the dissenter may say : '' What dif - ference does it make ?

		The average high school student does n't care a straw whether neither is an adverb or a conjunction , and whichever way he learns it he will straightway forget it . ''

		Teachers of English , however , inclined to op - timism , will insist that , if you are going to bother a pupil with such little things as parts of speech , it is best to aim at accuracy of instruc - tion always , whether you hit the mark or not .

		The author 's treatment of '' irregular verbs '' is , to a man of feeling , simply horrible .

		Dare , an irregular verb , Deal , a verb of the weak conjugation , Dig , a verb of the strong conjuga - tion , are all dumped together in the same pile .

		To one trained in modern methods a return to such a work a , s this would be like an attempt , in the eyes of a scientist , to teach modern biology out of
Goldsmith	PERSON	's '' Animated Nature . ''

		Here is a pretty bit of romance that has the flavor of antiquity to recommend it , and is en - tirely in harmony with its environment : `` Man , in Anglo-Saxon , was in the common gender ; woman was ' wife-man ' or weft-man , ' that is , the man that weaves . ''

		It is hard to kill a thing like that .

		Skeat 's
Etymological Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	has n't been able to do it in eighteen years .

		It seems to be en - dowed with the gift of immortality , and we may expect to hear from it again in the next crop of high-school commencement essays .

		The study of English has made so rapid an advance in the
last quarter of the century	DATE	that this book was out of date the day it came from the press .

		It is half a century behind , and its effect upon English scholarship must needs be depressing .

		If justification be demanded for taking up so much space in reviewing a book of this kind , the plea must lie in the fact that the author is Principal of the
First Normal School	ORGANIZATION	of the great State of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, and late President of the
National Educational Association	ORGANIZATION	which met
last summer	DATE	at
Los Angeles	LOCATION	, the highest position in the gift of the teachers of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		It is to be feared , therefore , that official position may be expected to float this book , and there will be no lack of laudatory testimonials to fill its sails .

		There is one thing that may be said in praise of this book : it has steered clear of that fond device of grammaticasters , the diagram .

		For this the author has our sincere thanks .

		276 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, said nothing could be hazarded in affirming that far more had been spoken and printed , heard and read , on education in the country within the pre - ceding twelve years than ever before , were it all put together since the beginning of the colonies .

		What terms of comparison could Mr.
Mann	PERSON	, if now living , find for the similar manifestations of educational interest ?

		The remark is prompted by the continuous stream of educational literature that flows from the press .

		No doubt some of this activity is primarily due to the action of a force that now furnishes a prominent educational theme , that is imitation , and so is significant only indirectly ; but much of it springs from a deep-seated original interest , and reveals to us the strong current that is now in motion .

		Professor
James	PERSON	's hook , '' Talks to Teachers on Psychology , '' is one of the very best of the new works on the subject The psychology that forms the basis of the '' Talks '' is but a small part of the psychology found in the author 's great work bear - ing that title ; but there is enough to answer the present purpose , presented in beautifully clear and simple English , and well illustrated by examples drawn from the field of common observation .

		One can hardly help feeling , as he reads , that if psychol - ogy is not here shorn of its terrors for teachers , no other writer need hope to accomplish that task .

		One of the charms of the book is its uniform good sense .

		The writer has no respect for the pedagogical fashions and fads of the day because they are fashions and fads ; nor is he under any illusion as to the value of his special science to teachers , but has sound ideas as to what its value is , and how much there is of it .

		As an example of the way in which he deals with some of the favorite ideas of our popular educational guides , we quote from his remarks on the subject of emulation among pupils : 14 To veto and taboo all possible rivalry of one youth with another , because such rivalry may degenerate into greedy and selfish excess , does seem to savor somewhat of sentimentality , or even of fanaticism .

		The feeling of rivalry lies at the very basis of our being , all social improvement being largely due to it .

		There is a noble and generous kind of rivalry , as well as a spiteful and greedy kind ; and the noble and generous form is par - ticularly common in childhood .

		All games owe the zest which they bring with them to the fact that they are rooted in the emulous passion , yet they are the chief means of training in fairness and magnanimity .

		... The wise teacher will use this instinct as he uses others , reaping its advantages and appealing to it in such a way as to reap a maximum of benefit with a minimum of harm ; for , after all , we must confess with a French critic of
Rousseau	ORGANIZATION	's doctrine that the deepest
spring	DATE	of action in us is the sight of action in another .

		The spectacle of effort is what awakens and sustains our own efforts .

		No runner running all alone on a race track will find in his own will the power of stimu - lation which his rivalry with other runners incites , when he feels them at bis heels about to pass .

		When a trotting horse is ` speeded * a running horse must go beside him to keep him to the pace . ''

		Dr.
Ladd	PERSON	's '' Essays on the Higher Education , '' republished , deal with four important subjects : '' The Development of the
American University	ORGANIZATION	, '' `` The Place of the Fitting School in
American Education	ORGANIZATION	, '' '' Education New and Old , '' and '' A Modern Liberal Education . ''

		The views on these subjects of an able scholar , university professor , and student of education such as Dr.
Ladd	PERSON	is , could not fail to be valuable .

		He finds the problem of the development of the
University	ORGANIZATION	in this country to he largely the problem of securing a satis - factory secondary education .

		This done , he says it will be perfectly feasible to prepare the average American youth , at nineteen or twenty years of age , for beginning a true university education .

		He holds that if secondary education is properly reformed and duly elevated , the youth who has well accom - plished it will be better fitted to enter upon a university education than is at present the average youth at twenty-two who has just graduated from a first-class American college .

		This view of the case , which the facts certainly go a long ways toward sustaining , enlists the reader 's interest in the paper on the
Fitting School	ORGANIZATION	.

		The author 's prescription consists in part of relegating most of the colleges and so-called universities to the secondary sphere . ''

		Only those few institutions that have already acquired large resources of famous men and estab - lished courses and equipment for the highest instruction , and that can hope to draw from their own and from other colleges a sufficient constituency of pupils already trained in a thorough secondary education , should strive to develop themselves into universities . ''

		He ventures , therefore , '' to assert that not more than half a dozen Universities should be developed in the entire country during the next generation , and that no new institutions to bear that name should , on any grounds whatever , be founded . ''

		This may be a sound view to take of the matter , but we do not exactly see how it will be made practicable .

		Mr.
Boyer	PERSON	's outlook upon the '' Principles and Methods of Teaching '' is indicated by two facts .

		One is the statement in the preface that hia treatise is designed to be a stepping-stone to
Rosenkranz	PERSON	's `` Philosophy of Education '' and Tompkin 's '' Phi - losophy of Teaching . ''

		The other is his definition of education , '' The realization of man 's possibili - ties , through systematic self-activity , for complete living . ''

		The book is divided into three parts : `` Psychology , '' `` Principles of Teaching , '' and '' Methods of Teaching . ''

		It is as full of matter as it can hold , but we can not help thinking that the author would have done teachers a better ser - vice if he had left out many of his topics and treated some others more fully .

		Professor Salmon 's '' Art of Teaching '' opens with several general chapters on such topics as `` Some General Principles , '' `` Order , Attention , and Discipline , '' '' Oral Questioning , '' and '' Object Les - sons , '' and then passes to the branches of study
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 277 taught in elementary schools , treating them in a manner much more technical than is now the vogue in the
United States	LOCATION	in similar works .

		The book is marked by clearness of method and ai ` rangement , perspicuity of language , and sound good sense .

		It is one of those useful volumes that , while they add nothing new to the knowledge or practice in teach - ing , do good service wherever they are read .

		In
Froebel	PERSON	's `` Education by Development , '' trans - lated by
Miss Jarvis	PERSON	, and Miss Blow 's '' Letters to a Mother on the Philosophy of
Froebel	PERSON	, '' we have valuable additions to the growing volume of Froe - belian literature .

		The world is slowly learning how much larger this great master was than the kinder - garten , with which his name was so long exclusively associated .

		Perhaps no school superintendent in the country has taken a deeper interest in the social phases of education than Mr.
Samuel T. Dutton	PERSON	, formerly of
New Haven	LOCATION	,
Conn.	LOCATION	, now of
Brookline	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	.

		His volume entitled '' Social Phases of Education in the School and the Home '' is a selection from the lectures and papers that he has devoted to these phases of the general subject in the course of the last few years .

		As he says in his preface , the point of view is in all cases social rather than scholastic , and the ideas emphasized are as worthy of con - sideration by parents as by teachers .

		One of the most suggestive titles is the last , '' The
Brookline Education Society	ORGANIZATION	and its Work . ''

		The more such societies as this are organized and carried on in the country the better .

		There are few educational problems more pressing at the present time than the proper correlation of the school and the home .

		Messrs.
Dexter	PERSON	and
Garlick	PERSON	's '' Psychology in the School Room '' we account one of the best books of its kind that we have seen .

		It is not at all the same kind of book as Professor
James	PERSON	's `` Talks , '' although both titles contain the same leading word .

		It is far more comprehensive and thorough .

		First , the authors give enough physiology to furnish a basis for the subject proper ; next , they state and illustrate the main facts of psychology with remark - able correctness and clearness ; and then they apply these facts with great good sense to the practical work of the teacher .

		We can not exactly promise teachers that they will find the book easy reading , although we can not really agree that it is hard reading ; what is more , no book that deals thoroughly with the subject can be made wholly soft and easy .

		In his preface to Dr.
Rector	PERSON	's volume of selec - tions from
Montaigne	ORGANIZATION	's writings on the education of children , Dr.
Harris	PERSON	, the editor of the series in which the volume appears , says , '' The significance of Montaigne lies chiefly in his protest against pedantry , '' and this he defines to be the display of accumulated knowledge '' that is not systematized itself nor applied to the solution of practical prob - lems . ''

		That is one way of putting the case , and perhaps the best way .

		The traditional way of putting it is that Montaigne was in full rebellion against the literary education set up by the Renais - sance , and in complete sympathy with an education that consisted primarily of realities .

		Mr.
Oscar Browning	PERSON	assigns
Montaigne	ORGANIZATION	to the class of edu - cationalists whom he calls `` naturalists , '' `` not only because they profess to follow nature , '' but '' because they set before themselves as the chief good the development of the entire nature , and not merely the intellect or any part of it . ''

Laurie	PERSON	accounts Montaigne a realist , in the sense that he '' desired to see reality , that is , to see the substance of fact and thought dominant in the education of youth . ''

		The Professor says further : ''
Montaigne	ORGANIZATION	's realism opposed itself merely to verbalism , and he fought a good fight in this '' ; that is , he was not a natural-realist , claiming to find educational material solely in nature and real life , but a real-humanist , finding reality or substance in nature , in the human spirit , or in the records of past thought and feeling .

		Perhaps Dr.
Harris	PERSON	's statement does not differ materially in substance from Professor
Laurie	PERSON	's , but it is certainly put more sharply , and , formally speaking , more strikingly .

		It is well calculated to stick in the memory : Montaigne the protestor against pedantry is quite as striking as Montaigne the skeptic or Montaigne the rationalist .

		The question of classification aside , no one disputes or doubts that
Montaigne	ORGANIZATION	holds a very important place in the succession of educational reformers .

		The significance of Dr.
Rector	PERSON	's book lies in the fact that it brings the things Montaigne wrote about education together , presents them to the reader in small compass apart from the matter in which it is embedded in the original works , and accom - panies them with suitable preface , introduction , notes , and indexes .

		The service that he renders the student , and still more the mere reader , is an important one ; for it must be remembered that , in great part , what Montaigne had to say on this sub - ject he scattered here and there through his some - what voluminous writings .

		Mr.
Rector	PERSON	has much to say of his author 's '' modernity , '' and with good reason .

		He presents a full page , embracing twenty - one items , of '' modern educational ideas anticipated by Montaigne , '' and fortifies his generalizations with appropriate references .

		He has placed pedagogists , teachers , and readers of educational books under decided obligations to him .

		Mr.
P. A. Barnett	PERSON	's book on '' Common Sense in Education and Teaching '' is happily named as well as written .

		Educational practice , and educational thought and writing in less degree , oscillate between the two poles of crass empiricism and stark dogma - tism .

		At the one extreme stand those who deny in theory , if not in practice , that there are such things as controlling ideas or governing principles in teaching ; at the other , those who say , or think , that teaching is nothing more than the reading off of a formula .

		It is hard to say which one is nearer the truth , if the expression may be allowed , but we incline to the empiricist rather than the dogmatician .

		Therefore every book that points with reasonable 278 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, steadiness to the degree in the arc marked '' com - mon sense '' is heartily to be welcomed ; and much more than this can be claimed for Mr.
Barnett	PERSON	's work .

		He has no more patience with fads and faddists than has Professor
James	PERSON	.

		He explodes in his first chapter '' the complete sentence method , '' as pat by the dogmatician , and even defends in secondary schools marks and `` taking place '' under proper conditions .

		His remarks on questions and question - ing are excellent . '

		After all , it should be remembered that in tbe com - mon order of things it is tbe person needing instruction who usually asks questions , not the person giving it Why should tbe nature of things be topsy-turvy in the school - room ?

		It is not so at home .

		Why should the ques - tioner in school be almost always tbe teacher instead of the learner ?

		Our business is to make our scholars feel the lack of information , desire to ask questions ; to encourage them to find out what they can for them - selves , and to be keen to hear what we have to add to their stock .

		They must , in fact , question us , or at all events stand in the attitude of those who want to know . ''

		Seven of the eight chapters of Professor
Hanus	PERSON	' g `` Educational Aims and Educational Values '' were written as contributions to educational reviews .

		They are , however , well worthy of being put in this more accessible and permanent form .

		Like other books made up in the same way , this one can not claim an absolute centre of unity , and shows more or less centrifugal tendency ; but the first five chap - ters conform to a general plan that is well expressed in the title of the book .

		Professor
Hanus	PERSON	is always clear and pointed , leaving no one uncertain as to his meaning , or causing him to waste time in finding it out .

		He is never esoteric , transcendental , or '' pro- found '' in the sense that neither he nor anyone else knows exactly what he means .

		He writes clearly and strongly because he thinks clearly and strongly .

		Nobody , for example , can mistake the meaning of such a paragraph as this : * It is evident that any estimate of educational values must ultimately depend on educational aims .

		The studies chosen are the means -LRB- not the sole means , of course , but the most important means -RRB- for the realiza - tion of those aims .

		The conception of the end to be attained must therefore determine the value of the means proposed ; and any consideration of educational value must accordingly include a consideration of edu - cational aims . ''

		The author is thoroughly modern in his general view of education , in the good sense of that term .

		He holds with Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	, that the aim of educa - tion is to prepare for complete living .

		Again , he sees clearly that every national culture , and particu - larly every great national culture , must be rooted and grounded in the mother tongue .

		To quote three or four sentences on this point : '' This is the instrument of all the pupil 's acquisitions and of common intercourse with bis fellows .

		Moreover , it is tbe embodiment of rich stores of information and of the highest ideals of the race .

		If instruction in the mother tongue is not limited merely to the study of its form and structure , but really serves , as it should , as tbe means of exploring and interpreting both the world of external nature and the world of man , the mother tongue will be richer in incentives and possess higher incentives than all otber forms of knowledge , and it may therefore have a higher educational value than all other subjects . ''

		We should say , rather , it must have such higher educational value .

		The last chapter deals dis - criminatingly , if briefly , with the permanent influence of Comenius .

		The one chapter that now sees the light for the first time relates to what Professor
Hanus	PERSON	and his associates are trying to do for the study of education at
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	.

		Among the best judges , there will be no dissent from the statement that the value of child study to the parent or teacher is practical rather than scien - tific , and that it is reflex in character ; or , to be more definite , that it consists in mental habit rather than the possession of any specific facts or knowl - edge .

		This mental habit , of course , is an interest in and sympathy with the child that leads to intel - ligent observation of his mind , character , and life , and thus to a course of wise direction in consonance therewith .

		Mr.
Rowe	PERSON	's book on `` The Physical Nature of the Child '' is written in harmony with this view ; that is , the teacher should pursue child study primarily for practical ends , and not for the sake of advancing scientific knowledge of children .

		The book is one that may be well recommended to teachers .

		Certainly those who have read appreciatively that excellent book , '' Educational Reformers , '' will wish to know something more about its author , his life , character , and work .

		This '' something more '' they will find in the '' Life and Remains of the Rev.
R. H. Quick	PERSON	. ''

		The book consists of a memoir , 125 pages , and extracts from Mr.
Quick	PERSON	's note-books , 420 pages more .

		In his preface Mr.
Storr	PERSON	, the editor , says there are forty of these note-books , which , if printed in extento , would make ten or eleven vol - umes equal in size to the present one .

		They con - stitute a life-record extending over more than a quarter of a century .

		The interest of the memoir is touched with a tender pathos , for Mr.
Quick	PERSON	was of a reflective rather than practical turn of mind , and failed , externally speaking , to achieve the suc - cess in life that his mental abilities and personal qualities seemed to justify .

		Then there is the pathetic story of his death .

		What the editor left behind him unused , we do not know ; but he has not printed a page that was not worth printing , most of them well worth printing .

		Open the book - here you will , you are interested at once in what you see .

		It abounds in quotable passages , in fact is mainly made up of such passages .

		Mr.
Quick	PERSON	was a clergyman and a deeply religious man , facts which add importance to what he says of the re - ligious teaching in the
National	ORGANIZATION	schools and
Sunday	DATE	schools of
England	LOCATION	.

		The trouble here , as he depicts it , is the same as the trouble elsewhere : want of real interest in the lesson , and consequent filling of the mind with words .

		He declares that ''
Sunday 1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 279 school teaching seems for the most part to be a wind-bag . ''

		And again : '' The truth is the religious teaching given to our young people is not good enough to interest them , so their minds do not take it in , and they remember at best words only . ''

		The state of things that he describes is not peculiar to
England	LOCATION	.

		As a rule ,
Sunday	DATE	schools are the worst taught of all American schools ; and that is saying a great deal .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		A disappointing Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	's book on exposition of ''
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead Matthew Arnold	PERSON	.

		& CQ -RRB- j g -RRB- Qn the who -RSB- e -RRB- a disap _ pointment .

		In his preface , after quoting
Arnold	PERSON	's complaint that
Macaulay	PERSON	, in his Essay on
Milton	LOCATION	, had given us not the real truth about
Milton	PERSON	but merely a panegyric on
Milton	PERSON	and the Puritans , Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	goes on to say that he has endeav - ored to '' help the reader who wants criticism . ''

		Even from this point of view the book is regretably deficient .

		We find here no picture of the man
Arnold	LOCATION	, poet , educational leader , essayist , religious reformer ; no attempt to expound his message to the world or his attitude toward life ; no setting forth of what the world was to him or he to the world , as
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	would have ; little beyond a few facts , drawn properly enough from the '' Letters , '' and Mr.
George Saintsbury	PERSON	's opinions about his writings ; and since Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	is merely '' an analyst of the form of art for its own sake , '' these will hardly do for
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	.

		In fact , Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	's attitude toward his subject makes us fear that he does not himself understand fully what
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	tried to do .

		The decade , for ex - ample , from
1867	DATE	to
1877	DATE	, which produced '' Cul - ture and Anarchy , '' '' St.
Paul	PERSON	and Protestantism , '' '' Literature and Dogma , '' '' God and the Bible , '' and '' Last Essays , '' is characterized by the head - ing `` In the Wilderness . ''

		Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	regrets this period of
Arnold	LOCATION	's life ; would have had him write more poems , and `` infinite essays . ''

		We agree with the biographer that this is an idle wish , by suppressing which some space might have been saved ; but we can not agree with him as to this estimate of the religious reform era of
Arnold	LOCATION	's life .

		Granted that
Arnold	PERSON	was often misunderstood , often produced an effect quite unlike that intended ; was his work in those years therefore a failure ?

		History assures us that scores of prophets have had to wait long before their words began to win comprehension ; the most notable instance of all , probably , coming from
Nazareth	LOCATION	.

		Even if some of
Arnold	LOCATION	's arguments in '' Literature and Dogma , '' were wide of the mark though we think Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	has not quite succeeded in overthrowing them , still , our biographer admits that no one '' smashed '' the book , as Dean Mansel if alive or
Cardinal Newman	PERSON	if then in the fold '' could have done '' ; and its influence may be judged by the fact that a few years ago it was voted by the readers of an English democratic newspaper to be
Arnold	LOCATION	's most valued book .

		Every student of
Arnold	LOCATION	's life knows that the really serious work of his later years was not the composition of pure literature , but was rather an attempt to change some sadly mistaken ideals of the English people ; as one writer puts it , to transform , without destroying , their re - ligion .

		Now , Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	, with his merely literary tastes , apparently does not understand , or if he does understand he gives a very inadequate ac - count of , the conditions which Arnold set himself to improve .

		It is certain that he has by no means said the last word concerning this part of
Arnold	LOCATION	's life .

		The criticisms on
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's poetry , however , are sane , and if we set aside some obscurities of style and some violations of elegance , are fairly well done .

		The Dutch and others in
Africa	LOCATION	.

		Sir
Harry H. Johnston	PERSON	's ''
Coloniza	PERSON	- tion of
Africa	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is an attempt '' to summarize and review in a single book the general history of the attempts of
Asia	LOCATION	and
Europe	LOCATION	to colonize
Africa	LOCATION	during the historical period . ''

		The volume is true to the au - thor 's promise , crammed with facts and encyclopae - dic in character ; in spite of which we have an altogether readable book bearing evidence of ex - treme care and careful research .

		Of special inter - est at the present time is the chapter on '' The Dutch in
Africa	LOCATION	. ''

		Although this chapter was writ - ten before it became evident that Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	stood back of the Uitlanders of
Johannesburg	LOCATION	in their demand for greater concessions and a larger degree of political influence in the
Transvaal	LOCATION	, the general question of
England	LOCATION	's relation to the Dutch in
South Africa	LOCATION	is carefully examined .

		Treated historically , it serves to show that the present crisis is but the culmination of two centuries of differ - ences between peoples of widely separated degrees of civilization .

		Mr.
Johnston	PERSON	argues that the chief difficulty has always been the failure of a nineteenth - century administrative to understand a seventeenth - century subject population , for such he considers the Dutch of
South Africa	LOCATION	.

		The British govern - ment is credited with having failed from the begin - ning to take proper measures for the maintenance and spread of English influence .

		Reforms have been too suddenly and too harshly executed , as in the case of the abolition of slavery in
Cape Colony	LOCATION	; or , on the other hand , the proverbial stubbornness of the
Boers	PERSON	has too easily frightened English min - isters from projects of sound policy .

		Incidentally , the author makes the curious assertion that if Scotch administrators had been sent to
Cape Colony	ORGANIZATION	early in the present century , few of the later troubles would have followed .

		This opinion is based upon the fact that the Scotch and the Dutch are similar in character , temperament , and religion ; though why the Scotch more than the English should have sympathized with the patriarchal form of slave - 2SO THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, holding desired by the Dutch , is not made clear .

		The attitude of Mr.
Cecil Rhodes	PERSON	, in indirectly urging the movement which resulted in the deplor - able
Jameson	PERSON	raid , is criticised .

		In reference to this point , the author maintains that an amicable settlement of the grievances of the Johannesburgers would have been accomplished ultimately through pressure from the
Cape Colony Dutch	LOCATION	upon those of the
Transvaal	LOCATION	.


Britain	LOCATION	's difficulties now are directly traceable to her shilly-shally policy toward the Dutch in the early part of the century , and to the essentially different aspect in which life , its duties and its privileges , presents itself to the Dutch and to the English mind .

		Other chapters treat of each important colonizing nation in turn , and all are instructive and entertaining .

		The book con - tains some unusually good maps , showing
Africa	LOCATION	by religions , by areas of slave trade , by colonizability , and by political divisions at different periods .

		`` The Authority of Criticism and Other Essays '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is the title of a new volume by Professor
W. P. Trent	PERSON	.

		The essays are nine in number , concerned with literary themes , and happily combining discus - sions of theory with practical applications of the critical principles to which the author adheres .

		The titular essay offers one of the strongest pleas ever made for criticism of the academic and authorita - tive sort .

		Mr.
Trent	PERSON	's opinion of the other sort of criticism may be inferred from his prefatory refer - ence to the critics who '' continue their uncomfort - able and undignified floundering in the bogs of dog - matism and impressionism . ''

		Here we are in hearty agreement with the author ; elsewhere , as in the essay on
Shelley	LOCATION	, we are compelled to disagree with him , although with respect .

		To defend
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's perverse opinion of Shelley is , to our mind , as hopeless a task as could well be attempted ; yet this is substantially what Mr.
Trent	PERSON	undertakes to do .

		Nor is his attempt to make us accept
Arnold	PERSON	's exaggerated estimate of Byron much less hopeless .

		The palpable honesty of his dealings with these two vexed themes enlists our sympathies , but his argu - ments fail to convince .

		A more doubtful problem is raised by the essay on ''
Tennyson	PERSON	and Musset Once More . ''

		Here there is no definite pronounce - ment , but rather a plea for fairness .

		We have re - cently discussed this subject editorially , and agree with Mr.
Trent	PERSON	in thinking that English criticism has taken the relative inferiority of French poetry far too much for granted .

		Among the remaining essays of this collection , those entitled '' Literature and Morals , '' `` The Nature of Literature , '' and `` Teaching the Spirit of Literature '' are the most important , and display what seems to us unexcep - tionable soundness of judgment .

		We read the last - named of these three , and pray that the ideas to which it gives expression may sometime find their way into the English departments of our schools and colleges .

		We hope that Mr.
Trent	PERSON	's volume will reach many readers ; for it surely deserves time .

		The studies are so fine , both in their liter - ary form and literary feeling , that no one could fail to profit by their perusal or could help being stim - ulated by them , even when dissenting most vigor - ously from their conclusions .

		Mine .

		Sarah fell ill a year ago , and had to submit to the surgeon 's knife .

		In convalescence she amused herself by telling
M. Huret	PERSON	the story of her life with some omissions , but still with great candor .

		Her age will be sought in vain in this biography , and many other things which have to do with her private life .

		But her professional career is spread before the reader like a panorama , and it discloses in every one of its many pictures a very great dramatic artist , an artist whose memory is a lasting delight to all who have seen her .

		Of her endeavors in the sister arts of painting and sculpture , there is too little said here , and that rather beside the purpose .

		It is curious to observe , in the later parts of the book , Mme.
Bernhardt	PERSON	's desire to be taken as a missionary in behalf of the French tongue , rather than as an ex - ponent of an art so universal as to comprise the modern world in its appeal .

		This last estimate be - ing true , it seems needless to criticize the taste of the work .

		M.
Edmond Rostand	PERSON	, who writes a brief preface for his friend ,
M. Huret	PERSON	, says the account made him dizzy .

		It is likely that any attempt to follow Mme.
Bernhardt	PERSON	's indefatigable personality will have the same effect ; but
M. Rostand	PERSON	's insist - ence that it is the workwoman in Mine .

		Bernhardt who appeals to him rather than the vagarious creature outside , reveals the fact .

		The translation into En - glish is by
M. G. A. Raper	PERSON	, and is clear and idiomatic .

		Mr.
Wyndham	PERSON	was what is known as a '' gentleman ranker '' a man of good birth , breeding , and education , who for personal reasons courts the blandishments of the recruiting - officer , and takes the Queen 's shilling .

		It was in

Wyndham	PERSON	decided to take the plunge ; and he presently found himself duly enrolled under the comprehensive and conveniently vague patronymic of
Robinson	PERSON	, '' and undergoing the final test in the ceremonial of enlistment , t. c. , the taking of the

		Some of the men , how - ever , made up for this little discrepancy on my part by kissing their Bibles with gusto , invoking at the same time strange deities in aid of their due ob - servance of their vows .

		My immediate neighbor , for instance , audibly exclaimed ' S'elp me Gawd !

		May I be struck pink if I goes back on it ! '' '

		Thus began Mr.
Wyndham	PERSON	's seven years of service , at home , and in
Ireland	LOCATION	,
Gibraltar	LOCATION	,
Malta	LOCATION	, South Af - rica , etc. , during which time he rose to be a ser - geant , closing his service by purchasing his discharge .

		Mr.
Wyndham	PERSON	has taken pains to describe tersely and literally the common soldier 's prosaic routine of life , which he does with a saving vein of humor , and with a keen eye to the peculiarities of '' Tommy
Atkins	PERSON	'' whose besetting sin is clearly a fondness for the Canteen that must inevitably impair his character as a man and his efficiency as a soldier .

		On the whole , however , the author 's account of army life is rather favorable strikingly so , if we compare his book with
M. Decle	PERSON	's recent extremely bitter book on the
French Army	ORGANIZATION	, which may be profitably compared with the present volume .

		Of these two works , Mr.
Wyndham	PERSON	's is decidedly the more impersonal and purely descriptive , and there - fore the more likely to inspire faith in its trust - worthiness .

		There are several photographic plates representing types of the British soldier .

		Its latest additions are ''
Joshua	PERSON	, '' by
W. H. Bennett	PERSON	of
London	LOCATION	, and '' Eze - kiel , '' by
C. H. Toy	PERSON	, of
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The Book of Joshua '' is the most polychrome specimen we have seen .

		Its clear text is printed on eight different colored backgrounds , while there are five such backgrounds for its italics .

		These documents , together with one additional one indicated by sym - bols , make up a total of fourteen sources of the book of
Joshua	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	, with a marvellous inge - nuity , and we might almost say audacity , pictures to his readers just how these documents were joined and pieced together .

		The archaeological and topog - raphical notes are valuable in that they are fresh and up-to-date .

		The volume on
Ezekiel	PERSON	is not , beyond the title-page , in any sense polychrome .

		Professor Toy 's wisdom is expended on the trans - lation and notes .

		By careful textual work he has made notable improvements in the rendering of this difficult book .

		The notes , too , indicate wide read - ing , and discrimination in the use of matter .

		The use of illustrations in these books deserves the same criticism as that given on former volumes .

		They are abundant , some excellent , some good , some fair , some poor .

		Many are appropriate , some are only remotely related to the subject , and some even represent what is not the case .

		There is an overplus of illustrations from the monuments , whose bearing on the text is barely tangential .

		The volume on
Joshua	PERSON	is admir - able , one of the best specimens of the results of the subjective literary analysis of the Old Testament ; while that on
Ezekiel	PERSON	is an exhibition of first-class scholarship applied to one of the difficult and most - neglected books of the Old Testament .

		The book , while not so chatty and amusing as its lively predecessor , contains never - theless more solid meat of information and matter of actual newness .

		Gossip about contemporary English men of letters , and of social and political celebrities , such as the earlier volume contains , we get nowadays in many forms and from many hands ; but it is not by any means every man whose ex - periences qualify him to write as interestingly and instructively of
India	LOCATION	and the Indians as can the learned editor of the Veda the `` Pundit of the Far West , '' as one of his Hindu friends styles him .

		It is needless , perhaps , to say that Professor
Muller	PERSON	has never journeyed , save in imagination , to
India	LOCATION	.

		Such Indians as he has known have been travellers from Hindustan who have sought him out in
England	LOCATION	, or natives with whom he has corresponded .

		His name is naturally a familiar one to Indian scholars .

		The volume is divided into five chapters , the best one of which , and the one for which the average reader will be most truly thankful , being that which treats of the Veda for , says Professor
Muller	PERSON	, '' Was not the Veda the first of my Indian friends ?

		Was it not the bridge that led me from
West to East	LOCATION	, from
Greece	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	to
India	LOCATION	, nay , from
Dessau	LOCATION	to
Oxford	LOCATION	, from
Germany	LOCATION	to
England	LOCATION	? ''

		This chapter , besides describing and explaining the general character of this oldest of books , contains eight translations of Vedic hymns , rendered as nearly as possible in the metre of the original .

		The book is written in the author 's usual pleasant style , and its theme lies in a special sense within his province .

		Letters from `` The Etchingham Letters , '' which an English have been appearing serially in the family circle .

		Cornell '' magazine , and which Messrs.

Frederick Pollock	PERSON	and Mrs.
Fuller Maitland	PERSON	, who , in the re - spective characters of Sir
Richard Etchingham	PERSON	and his sister , carry on a familiar correspondence with each other .

		These letters have no story to tell , or at best the merest thread of a story ; but as we read them we find ourselves becoming intimately ac - quainted with members of the
Etchingham	PERSON	family circle , and the letters come to have an interest for us that is almost personal .

		The announcements of this book speak of its '' literary flavor , '' but the sug - gestion is misleading .

		Although written for publi - cation , they show hardly a trace of pose , and it is difficult to realize that they are not the actual cor - respondence of the members of a cultivated English family .

		They are rarely even bookish , and are more likely to tell about the doings of the domestic 282 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, Btttiitttftnt taut mtmnritt * / Old
Cambridge	LOCATION	cat than about the intellectual preoccupations of their writers .

		Their charm is indubitable , although not easy to define .

		It lies in their unaffacted sim - plicity , in the entire lack of anything that is stilted in their expression , and in the glimpses that they give us of the intimate daily life of the brother and sister who keep in touch with one another by their means .

		- Recollections and memoirs are often as uncalled for as they are interest - j ng | and it J g unQ8Ua l ^ fi n < i tnem grouped in the form of historical sketches .

		Mr.
Thomas Wentworth Higginson	PERSON	, '' In Old Cam - bridge '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , has added to the rapidly increasing number of his reminiscences , however , a somewhat careful volume upon those of his friends who have done so much to make
Cambridge	LOCATION	the source of scholarly and literary influence through - out our country .

		In a general way , we have been ready to render the honor due to this town ; but after one has read this book , no matter how strong has been his devotion to the literary Mecca of
New England	LOCATION	, he will be convinced that its importance has been underestimated .

		In a certain way , it may be that the group of remarkable men which Mr.
Higginson	PERSON	describes have become as remote as other classics ; but for this very reason we can be grate - ful to the author for recalling so distinctly the sev - eral personalities in connection with the town to which they were so uniformly loyal .

		Perhaps aa interesting as anything in the volume is the account of the early days of '' The
Atlantic	LOCATION	, '' and the anal - ysis of its contents into material that did or did not originate in
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		The volume contains an interesting chapter upon
Carthage	LOCATION	, and another upon African literature , the latter being calculated to surprise the easy-going reader who has generously handed over all
Africa	LOCATION	, ancient and modern , to the negroes .

		ID fact , the entire volume is filled with information which hitherto has been almost the entire property of the special student in Roman history .

		The volume contains four maps , and a special study of the city of

Modern Language Association of America	ORGANIZATION	, has now reached its fourth part , which we understand com - pletes the work , although the author promises in a further paper '' to bring together the Elizabethan dra - mas that are Italian in source , or scene , or direct sug - gestion . ''

		The present work , as now completed in its four sections , describes 411 translations , made by 219 Englishmen from 223 Italian authors , and provides substantial evidence of the author 's thesis to the effect that no other '' foreign vogue , before or since , ever took such hold upon English society . ''

		A volume of Elementary Studies in Chemistry , '' by Mr.
Joseph Torrey , Jr.	PERSON	, is published by the Messrs.
Holt	PERSON	.

		It is a text-book of inorganic chemistry upon a new plan , combining lectures and demonstrations with laboratory work in a manner that commends itself strongly to our approval .

		We quote a few timely sen - tences from the preface : `` Chemistry has suffered from the irrepressible wave of laboratory madness which has swept over the whole educational world ... Nothing too severe can be said against the mechanical and demoralizing system of note-books with < opera - tion , ' ' observation , ' and ' inference ' headings .

		They are wholesale breeders of dishonest and superficial work . ''

		It was time for some one to say these things , and we commend the book most heartily .

		The essen - tial aim of the author is to restore the disciplinary value of the study , and his method is well worthy of attention .

		The `` Second Year Latin '' book -LRB- Ginu -RRB- of Professors
Greenough	PERSON	, D'Ooge , and
Dauiell	PERSON	, consists of two parts , the first containing nearly a hundred pages of easy prose , the second something like four books of
Caesar	LOCATION	.

		About four hundred pages of notes and vocabulary supplement the text , making a thick volume altogether .

		The same publishers send us an edition of the '' Hippolytos '' of Euripides , edited by Mr.
J. E. Harry	PERSON	.

		`` A First Greek Book '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- is the work of Dr.
L. L. Forman	PERSON	.

Mitchell	PERSON	. ''

		Longmans ' Illustrated First Latin Reading - Book and Grammar , '' by Mr.
H. R. Heatley	PERSON	, is a very elementary work indeed .

		From the
Oxford Clarendon Press	ORGANIZATION	we have a two-page fac - simile -LRB- with reprint -RRB- of ''
Juvenali	PERSON	's ad Satiram Sextam in
Codice Bodl	ORGANIZATION	.

		Miss
Hannah Lynch	PERSON	's ''
Toledo	PERSON	, the Story of an Old Spanish Capital '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is one of the admirable series treating of '' Mediaeval Towns '' in their various aspects , and its particular subject is of more than ordin - ary interest , even where all is interesting .

		Toledo has been a city of kings from before the days when no less a person than
Hannibal	PERSON	did its inhabitants the honor of defeating them .

		It possessed a spirit so indomitable that neither Roman nor
Saracen	PERSON	could reduce it to de - pendence , so Miss Lynch tells us .

		But to-day it is in the midst of restorations and other acts of vandalism which bid fair to destroy the best of the little left of its wonderful inheritance from the ages .

		`` A strong story .

		The scenery is new , as the story is a Cornish romance .

		The writer tells of humble folk , seafaring people , as rough as their coast ; but the tale is a powerful one .

		What the English critics say of EZEKIEL 'S SIN . ''

		Cornwall is fortunate in having an interpreter of its life so capable of understanding its spirit and of rendering some - thing of its rugged external beauty .

		He has a high ideal of form and expression , and the book is full of delightful pictures of the sea , the lonely life of the fishermen , and the sparse dwellers of the coast . ''

		The Sketch . ''

		Mr.
Pearce	PERSON	can portray character with remarkable clear - ness and power , and he has the fortunate gift of being able to bring home intimately to his readers the sights and sounds of nature .

		The atmosphere of the stormy Cornish coast suf - fuses the whole of this book . ''

		THIRD : Because of the excellent Introductions and critical comment of the editors .

		FOURTH : Because of the helpful Notes and their scholarly arrangement -LRB- chiefly in the form of glos - saries -RRB- .

		By
HALDANE McFALL	PERSON	.

		With frontispiece .

		12mo ,
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		The scene of this remarkable and somewhat startling novel is laid in the
West Indies	LOCATION	, where the author was for many years an officer in a Zouave regiment .

		It is the most powerfully realistic representation of negro life ever written , and must certainly become one of the most widely discussed volumes of the year .

		AN AMERICAN OPINION .

		The Commercial Advertiser -LRB-
New York	LOCATION	-RRB- : `` Mr.
McFall	PERSON	has drawn a tense , pitiless picture of the supersti - tion , sensuality , and general abasement of a type which in lacking ' sex-honor , ' lacks , he thinks , the keystone of civilization .

		There is much in this book which is not agreeable reading ; yet there is an undeniable fascin - ation in his portrayal of the intense , pulsating , animal life of the tropics ; while the remarkable incantation scene in the tenth chapter , where ' the Widow Tiffles becomes possessed of a devil , ' in the manner of treat - ment forcibly suggests the much-praised pilgrimage scene in
D'Annunzio	PERSON	's
Triondo della Morte	LOCATION	.

		There is no question that the book is bound to attract attention as something unique in contemporary fiction . ''

		SOME ENGLISH OPINIONS .

		The
London	LOCATION	Times : '' Paints the nigger to the life . ''

		| The
Saturday	DATE	Review : '' An extraordinary story . ''

		The Daily News : '' A vital study , wrought with swift strong strokes . ''

		The Bookman : '' From the first paragraph this novel must arrest the attention of such as care for good writing in their fiction , and are sensible to power and truth in the description of the external world .

		THE BEACON BIOGRAPHIES were issued to meet what in the opinion of the Editor and the Pub - lishers , was a direct need in American literature , a series of brief , well-written , readable , and authoritative biographies of eminent Americans , to include , in the end , all whose lives were notably dis - tinctive or typical .

		In respect of manufacture , the Publishers have attempted to make a set of '' little books '' which should worthily compete , in all points of style and workmanlike thoroughness , with any of the well-known series which are made in
England	LOCATION	.

		Each volume measures 3 : j z 5 . -RSB-

		inches , and is thus of a size to go handily into the pocket .

		The cover -LRB- in blind and gold on limp blue cloth -RRB- is by Mr.
Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue	PERSON	, who has done also the standing title-page for the series , which has been engraved on copper .

		The frontis - piece portrait which accompanies each is in photogravure .

		The paper has been selected with great care , and the type used is a new face specially cut .

		The notices of the Beacon Biographies in the reviews have been complimentary to a high degree .

		Thus the
Boston Herald	ORGANIZATION	says : `` There is neither romanticism nor realism in the treatment ; the effort is always toward the sanest , fairest , soundest reality . ''

		`` As carefully prepared , '' says the
New York Times	ORGANIZATION	, `` as if they were so many imperial quartos . '' ''

		The form of these little volumes , '' according to the Nation , '' and the general tastefulness of the get-up are delectable . '' ''

		They do more than languidly interest , '' says the Outlook , `` they interest vividly ; and their instruction is surprisingly comprehensive . ''

		The Churchman ex - tends '' a hearty welcome to this useful little series , which should bring many who shrink from attempting long volumes to a better knowledge of the men who have impressed their personality on the history of their country or the character of their countrymen . ''

		And the Review of Reviews says : '' The five volumes thus far issued wholly justify all the promises made by the publishers . ''

		The story deals with the fortunes of an

		The scenes are laid largely in
England	LOCATION	, and the author 's pictures of
London	LOCATION	society and of the varied intrigues of that stirring time are graphic and striking .

		A pretty love story runs through the book and adds much to the reader 's satisfaction as well as to that of the
Parson	ORGANIZATION	.

		M <
Parson Kelly	PERSON	' is a beguiling variation on the old delightful theme ... Mr.
Lang	PERSON	has brought to the com - position of this novel so much historical lore , so much insight into the Jacobite comedy , so much sympathy for the actors in it , both major and obscure , that the book is alive with true romance .

		The Prince scarcely appears , yet the air of plot and counterplot , of brave deeds and shabby intrigue , in which he and his house are enveloped , breathes from every page ... Historical knowledge and imaginative power are in
Parson Kelly	LOCATION	' blended into a remarkably compact and plausible unit . ''

		325 IDIOM AND IDEAL .


Elizabeth Barrett	PERSON	, in one of her letters to
Robert Browning	PERSON	, asked him whether he con - sidered '' the sailor - idiom to be lawful in poetry , '' adding that , for her part , she does not .

		The reply runs as follows : '' The Sailor Language is good in its way ; but as wrongly used in Art as real clay and mud would be , if one plastered them in the foreground of a land - scape in order to attain to so much truth . ''

		To all of this
Miss Barrett	PERSON	assents , remarking further that '' art without an ideal is neither nature nor art .

		The question involves the whole difference between
Madame Tussaud	ORGANIZATION	and Phidias . ''

		The question of aesthetics thus raised is one of peculiar interest to the present period , and has become far more burning than it could have been when the above correspondence was exchanged .

		There are few features of the re - cent literary situation as noteworthy as the large production and wide vogue of writings which exploit some special form of idiom and rely for their main interest upon the appeal to curiosity thus made .

		The idiom of the sailor and the soldier , the rustic and the mechanic , have el - bowed their way into literature , and demand their share of the attention hitherto accorded chiefly to educated speech .

		The normal type of English expression has to jostle for recog - nition with the local and abnormal types of the
Scotchman	PERSON	and the Irishman , the negro and the baboo , and , in our own country particularly , with such uncouth mixtures as those of the German - American and Scandinavian -
Ameri	LOCATION	- can .

		Examples lie upon every hand .

		We think at once of the '' kailyard '' group of story - tellers , of `` Mr.
Dooley	PERSON	'' and Mr.
Seumas Mc	PERSON	-
Manus	ORGANIZATION	, of Mr.
J. W. Eiley	PERSON	and ''
Charles Eg	PERSON	- bert
Craddock	PERSON	, '' and , foremost among all these phenomena , of the writings of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	.

		An observer who looks beyond the momen - tary caprices of literary fashion is compelled ta ask , in the contemplation of so great a volume of dialect and specialized jargon , whether thia sort of work can claim to be literature in any high sense of the term .

		Does the speech of Tommy
Atkins	PERSON	and
Marse Chan	PERSON	, the dialect of Drumtochty and
Donegal	LOCATION	, the locution of the Hoosier farmer and the Bowery tough , have anything of the antiseptic quality that THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, preserves a story or a poem and enables it to delight successive generations of readers .

		The history of our literature is fairly instructive upon this point .

		With few exceptions , the writings of the past that have relied mainly upon their use of an abnormal idiom have passed completely out of the memory of men .

		It is true that such a novel as `` The Anti- quary '' and such a poem as `` The Northern Farmer '' have assured places among the works that live , but how easy it is to see that their idiom is merely an accident of their production , and not the determining motive .

		They survive in spite of their departure from accepted modes of expression , and not in consequence thereof .

		But nine-tenths of our latter-day jargon - mongers have for their whole stock-in-trade some grotesque form of English speech ; strip them of this , and the revelation of their poverty would be indeed pitiful .

		They offer novelty , and they amuse for an hour the novelty-seeking section of the public .

		A little later , their books collect dust upon the library shelves , and the counter of the dry-goods store sees them no more .

		The case of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	offers so typical an illustration of the proposition with which we are now concerned that it deserves close ex - amination .

		We should be the last to deny the noble qualities of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's art in its finer manifestations .

		While it almost never gives evidence of that labor limes of which the really great masters are so lavish , its primesautier quality , its downright energy and superb emo - tional appeal , compel our admiration , and almost make us wish that the praise bestowed might be ungrudging .

		If we judge Mr.
Kip	PERSON	- ling by his good work alone , as every poet has a right to be judged , he must be given a place among the dozen or so of living English singers who approach most closely the height now oc - cupied in solitary eminence by Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	.

		As a writer of prose narrative he has taken a lesson from Mr.
Bret Harte	PERSON	, and bettered the instruction .

		He is not one of the great novel - ists , but the best of his stories have a fair chance of being read well along in the twentieth century .

		So much , and possibly more , must be accorded him by every sober-minded critic .

		But between this measured and deserved praise on the one hand , and the wild acclaim of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's present vogue on the other , there is a great gulf fixed .

		And when we come to inquire into the causes of the vogue , we find that it has little to do with his best work .

		It is the ''
Danny Deever	PERSON	'' sort of poem , and not `` The English Flag '' sort of poem , which nine out of ten of his vociferous ad - mirers have in mind when they proclaim him a poet after their own heart ; and it is the Mul - vaney sort of story , rather than '' The Finest Story in the World , '' that they are really thinking of when they assert that he is first and the rest nowhere among story-tellers .

		A vogue that is based upon such judgments as these has a precarious vitality , and the reasons for which Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	will be held in honor - able literary remembrance are very different from those that determine his present popu - larity .

		It may be said that `` The Recessional '' affords common ground upon which the man of taste and the groundling may stand in voicing the praises of its author .

		This is , no doubt , a fine poem , although not without obvious faults , and it is greatly to the credit of the uncritical public that the poem found so responsive an echo in so many hearts .

		But when we find many of the same voices raised in .

		` prai.se of `` The White Man 's Burden , '' apparently not knowing the difference between the two , the situation '' gives to think , '' as the French say .

		And when we hear '' The Recessional '' recited approvingly by men who deny that their own nation should ever , no matter how greatly it has sinned , make the '' ancient sacrifice '' of '' an hum - ble and a contrite heart , '' - by men , in short , upon whose lips such words are blasphemy , we may see the difference between lip-service and sympathetic appreciation of a poem , and take at something like its true value the popular esti - mate of this particular poem and its author . ''

		The sailor language is good in its way , '' as
Browning	PERSON	said ; but it is not the way of great literature .

		And the same observation holds true of the soldier language , and the locomotive - driver language , and the
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	- Indian language . ''

		For it 's Tommy this , an ' Tommy that , an '
Chuck	PERSON	him out , the brute ! '

		But it 's ' Saviour of ` is country ' when the Runs begin to shoot ; An ' it 's Tommy this , an ' Tommy that , an ' anything you please ; An ' Tommy ai n't a hloomin 1 fool you bet that
Tommy	ORGANIZATION	sees ! ''

		This sort of thing is amusing , and vigorous , and even ethically sound ; but it is not litera - ture , for it does not square with the sober defi - nitions .

		What , for example , has it to do with Mr.
Morley	PERSON	's `` Literature consists of all the books ... where moral truth and human pas - sion are touched with a certain largeness , sanity , and attractiveness of form '' ?

		And what re - motest point of contact does it have with this statement of
Pater	ORGANIZATION	's abstract jestheticism : `` All art constantly aspires toward the condition of
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 307 music music , then , and not poetry , as is so often supposed , is the true type or measure of perfected art '' ?

		Not merely does the bulk of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's work and of the work of those countless lesser writers among whom he occu - pies a typical position fail to become art in anything like this transcendental sense , but it does not even seek to be art in the narrow sense that takes literature to be a self-contained pro- cess , with its own exclusive ideals .

		It does not aim to be ideal at all , but tries to outdo the rudest realism hitherto known .

		Reverting once more to
Browning	PERSON	's trenchant comment , it plasters its clay and mud in the foreground of the landscape , and wins a cheap popular ap - plause for its deftness , while the judicious stand apart and grieve at so violent a renunciation of idealism .

		For art , to be art at all , must be ideal .

		While it is true that '' Beyond that art Which you say adds to nature , is an art That nature makes , '' it nevertheless remains the duty of the artist to add to nature in the measure permitted by his imagination ; failing in this task , or deliberately eschewing it , he is recreant to his calling , and his work has no excuse for existence .

		POE COMING TO HIS KINGDOM .

		To one who tries to study Literature in the large , it seems as if we were just now passing through one of those irritating transition periods in which all standards are lowered or confused , in which Con - glomeration reigns , taste gets freaky or fantastical , and True Art hides her head or goes to sleep .

		Of course , all periods are transitional ; but some by their accentuation acquire the especial name , when literary or historic annals are compiled , and balances just , or approximate , are struck .

		But , irritating as the present period may or must be to the subtlest nerves of criticism , it is not with - out its assuring signs , its cloudless promises .

		The most cheering of present omens more than an omen ; indeed , almost a right earnest is the final rendering of complete literary justice in the land of his birth to that genuine man of letters whom the critical consensus of
Europe	LOCATION	has long acclaimed as our greatest literary genius .

		The recognition is rather late , but , clearly , it is to be lasting .


Edgar Allan Poe	PERSON	, '' the
Yankee Yahoo	ORGANIZATION	, '' a stupid English reviewer once called him , '' that jingle-man '' Emer - son with unwonted blindness or bitterness labelled him , while
Lowell	PERSON	, who knew better , spoke of him as '' three-fifths genius and two-fifths sheer fudge , '' has come , at last , to his kingdom .

		When
the University of Virginia	ORGANIZATION	, the Alma Mater from which he was not expelled and where he was never cen - sured even for alleged vices then common among the sons of Virginian gentry , honored his memory , but chiefly itself , by celebrating on
October	DATE	seventh the fiftieth anniversary of his untimely death , and by unveiling , with fitting ceremonies of prayer , poem , and address , a fine bust by an excellent sculptor , this long-delayed rendition of poetic justice , this formal recognition in
America	LOCATION	of his world-wide fame and genius , was made complete .

		The choice of essayist for the occasion may be fairly considered a happy inspiration on the part of the committee , Professors Kent and
Harrison	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Hamilton W. Mabie	PERSON	rose to his theme easily , and in the agreement of all brother critics who had the pleasure of hearing him deliver his choicely chosen phrases , he surpassed all his former adventures in the field of criticism .

		Mr.
Mabie	PERSON	happily steered between the Scylla of loose laudation and the Charybdis of exaggeration where so many admirers of
Poe	PERSON	have been drowned , and at the same time he announced that
Poe	PERSON	was entitled to the first place in American letters by virtue of possessing a most exacting literary conscience and producing works of the clearest and finest art .

		His essay , which will appear soon in the ''
Atlantic Monthly	LOCATION	, '' and to which I eagerly commend all readers of THE DIAL , was as convincing in its equations as it was tem - perate in its eloquence .

		But more convincing still as to
Poe	PERSON	's position at the present day were the letters which arrived from all parts of the country , in which many of the most justly distinguished men and women of the literary craft paid cordial tribute to the great man whom his own day and generation kept close on the brink of starvation and stimulated to seek solace in those occasional excesses to which , most unfortunately , he appears to have had a terrible pre-natal bias .

		It was clear from those letters , too , that not only has the silly old sectional animosity , at the bottom of so much general mischief and operant to a consider - able degree against
Poe	PERSON	in his life , entirely vanished , but that an almost absolute unanimity of opinion as to his literary merits has come in the literary world .

		Few names of any importance or promise of perma - nence were missing from the illustrious list of those whose letters hailed
Poe	PERSON	as
America	LOCATION	's most illustrious writer and most luminous literary influence .

		Thus , indeed , was verified by example Professor
Minto	PERSON	's apt dictum years ago : '' The feelings to which
Poe	PERSON	appeals are simple but universal , and he appeals to them with a force that has never been surpassed . ''

		Mr.
Minto	PERSON	should have written '' power '' instead of '' force . ''

		The distinction is infinite , though fine ; and was never more applicable than in the case of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's writings .

		There is no blare of trumpets , no firing of rockets , in the main and mass of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's work .

		Nearly all are developed in the calm of a sure ele - mental energy .

		Even his '' pot-boilers '' bear traces of this power and of that splendid conscientiousness on which Mr.
Mabie	PERSON	did not harp any too much .

		Such a vast amount of twaddle has been circu - lated about
Poe	PERSON	's personal character , his bad habits , his lack of moral perceptions , his indifference to the 308 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, esteem of his fellow men , that one shrinks from dignifying it with much attention or keeping alive the poor little fames of Foe 's chief libellers by citing their names with their absurd accusations .

		Lowell 's little outfling of unworthy spleen can be easily forgiven .

		Foe forgave it in advance by de - fending
Lowell	PERSON	from an English blackguard of the pen , and proclaiming
Lowell	PERSON	as one of the noblest poets
America	LOCATION	had then produced .


Emerson	PERSON	, who was a greater poet in the rough , to my mind , than
Lowell	PERSON	, must be pardoned for his bitterness Foe had ridiculed his proneness to play Sir
Oracle	ORGANIZATION	; or possibly it was not bitterness , but a mere blindness to Foe 's art and a deafness to Foe 's music .

		Yet Foe was recognized in a measure , when alive , by men of real intellectual fibre .

		There is the recognition of hostility as well as that of cordial appreciation and friendship .

		Perhaps , too , there is in it more cer - tainty of permanent fame and influence .

		That Foe enjoyed his isolation , to some degree , is not unlikely .

		Some natures , though not unphilanthropic , are at - tuned for solitude : some talents ripen in the shade .

		There has been , it seems to me , considerable mis - chief done to Foe and the cause of truth by the over - zeal of some of his champions .

		The medial sound fact of this whole matter appears to be that Foe , though an almost perfect artist , scarcely deserved that any man should pray to him every morning as Baudelaire used to do ; that Foe , though possessed of many winning and gracious attributes when sane , did some dreadful and dreadfully strange things , when not in sober senses ; that , as he happened to be a man of genius and temperament combative at all times , his flaws and failings , which would have passed compar - atively unnoticed in an ordinary person , got blazoned broadcast to the world .

		THE MEANING OF `` THE MAN WITH THE HOE . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The comment of your reviewer , in THE DIAL of
Oct.	DATE	.

		1 , on Mr.
Markham	PERSON	's poem of '' The Man with the Hoe '' is fairer than a great many things said on the subject , but still seems to me not quite to the point . ''

		The Man with the Hoe '' as conceived by Millet and understood by Mr.
Mark	PERSON	ham , I suggest , is not the product of ordinary social conditions nor the represen - tative of the ordinary agricultural class .

		It is surely a misapprehension of Mr.
Markham	PERSON	's thought to sup - pose he meant to reflect on that class , that he looked on
Millet	ORGANIZATION	's delineation as typical of them , or that he charged such a prod net to Labor .

		It is not labor , duly rewarded and performed under conditions benefitting the dignity of human nature , that produces the man depicted by the painter .

		It is op - pression labor without compensation , the hardship and wrong of toil and sacrifice unrequited , an undue share of the burden of government running through long periods , that ripens such deadly fruit .

		Such were the conditions that led , by a long and toilsome road , down to the French revolution .

		Mr.
Markham	PERSON	, with the vision of a seer , sees the menace of related conditions , to result from not unlike causes , in the darkening and not remote future even in this most favored land .

		In the first volume of Carlyle 's '' French Revolution , '' , where be is digging down to the causes that underlay the mighty convulsion which is the subject of his history , he sees with reverted eye `` the twenty-five million * working people '' of
France	LOCATION	'' with whom it is not so well '' ; whom `` we lump together , '' be says , `` into a I dim , compendious unity , monstrous but dim , far off , as the canaille '' ' , whom he follows `` over broad
France	LOCATION	, into their clay hovels , into their garrets and hutches '' ; !

		masses yet units , '' every unit of whom has his own heart and sorrows ; stands covered there with his own skin , '' and who if you `` prick him '' will `` bleed '' ... `` Dreary , languid do these struggle in their obscure remoteness ; their hearth cheerless , their diet thin .

		For them in this world rises no Era of Hope ... Untaught , uncomforted , unfed !

		A dumb generation ; their voice only an inarticulate cry .

		... At rare intervals -LRB- as now in
1775	DATE	-RRB- they will fling down their hoes and hammers , and to the astonishment of thinking mankind flock -LCB- hither and thither , dangerous , aimless ; get the length I even of
Versailles	LOCATION	'' ; where in
May , 1775	DATE	, in answer to !

		their Petition of Grievances , '' two of them are hanged I on a ` new gallows forty feet high , ' and the rest driven : back to their dens for a time . ''

		Further along in the same chapter , the elder Mira - I beau describes the '' Man with the Hoe '' as he saw him j from his Iodging.s at the Baths of Mt. D'Or : `` The savages descending in torrents from the mountains I ... frightful men , or rather frightful wild animals , clad in , jupes of coarse woolen , with large girdles of leather studded with copper nails ; of gigantic stature , heightened by high wooden sabots ... their faces haggard and covered with their long greasy hair ; the upper part of the visage waxing pale , the lower distorting itself into the attempt at a cruel laugh and a sort of ferocious impatience .

		And these people pay the taille . '

		And yon want further to take their salt from them !

		And you know not what it is you are stripping barer , or , as yon call it , governing ; what , by the spurt of your pen , in its cold , dastard indifference , you will fancy you can starve always with impunity ; always till the catastrophe come ! '

		1 Thus the old Marquis .

		And in the next chapter Carlyle : '' Before those five and twenty laboring millions could get that haggardness of face , which old Mirabean now looks on , in a nation calling itself Christian and calling man the brother of man what unspeakable , nigh-infinite Dishonesty in all manner of Rulers , and appointed Watchers , spiritual and temporal , must there not through long ages have gone on accumulating ! ''

		It was such woes as these , cumulating through centu - ries down to the States General , to the fall of the Bas - tille , to the later Terror , such woes as no other civilized country ever produced or endured that Mr.
Markham	PERSON	must have seen in
Millet	LOCATION	's distorted image of outraged humanity when he penned that last expressive stanza : '' O , masters , lords and rulers in all lands , How will the future reckon with this man ?

		How answer his brute question in that hour When whirlwinds of rebellion shake the world ?

		How will it be with kingdoms and with kings With those who shaped him to the thing he is When this dumb terror shall reply to God After the silence of the centuries ? ''

		History has recorded , in characters never to be ex - punged , the answer to this '' brute question '' when it was asked in the stormy days of
Louis Capet	PERSON	and
Marie Antoinette	PERSON	; and we may depend that whenever and wherever even if it should be in this `` land of the free '' a like question presents itaelf , the answer will be of like character .

		1899 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 309 Mr.
Markham	PERSON	's poem is not only interpreted but justified by history and by economic philosophy .

		It is an arraignment of forces that are gathering a menac - ing power for evil in this country .

		It is , in his own words , '' A protest that is also a prophecy . ''

		HAST THOU SEEN YOUR FATHER ?

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Is there anyone at all trained in speech who would to-day use such a conjunction of pronouns as the above , or whose ear would not be offended by it if it were read or spoken by another ?

		Teachers of foreign lan - guages are brought into such constant contact with the offence through slovenly translations that they become perhaps morbidly sensitive to it .

		Therefore I ask the question seriously .

		Inasmuch as neither ' thou ' nor ' ye ' is any longer used in common speech , our feeling for the nice use of them is of course less quick and instinct - ive than in the case of , let us say , verbal agreement .

		The general distinctions between the three pronouns of the second person , especially as observed in earlier stages of the language , are familiar enough : ' thou ' from superiors to inferiors , among equals when intimate , and for the familiarity of endearment or contempt ; ` ye ' from inferiors to superiors , and of course as the plural of ` thou ' ; ` you , ' originally the encroachment of the oblique cases of ' ye ' upon the nominative , then the formal and polite plural and singular where the feeling for ' thou ' or ' ye ' was not strong , and finally the sole customary form both singular and plural .

		In literature the use of ' thou ' and ' ye , ' singular and plural respect - ively , secures the general effect of elevation ; while there is more or less attempt to retain the old distinc - tion between ' thou ' and ' ye ' singular , the result of the latter usage being a degree of archaism .

		When a transition is made from ` you ' to ' thou ' or ' ye , ' it is common to seek for a corresponding change in attitude on the part of the speaker .

		But it will not do to insist upon intention in this direction , even in the best writers .

		No writer of our time has written more in the loftiest tone than
Tennyson	LOCATION	.

		In '' The Idyls of the
King	PERSON	, '' not only is there the gen - eral elevation of style which is expected in the epic and the heroic drama , but there is a studied archaism which would warrant us in anticipating the nice distinctions of the older stages of the language .

		But the master has disappointed me so sorely that I almost hesitate to criticize any longer even such a sentence as that which I have used for a title to this note . '

		Thou , ' ' thyself , ' ` you , ' ` yourself , ' and ` ye ' are used almost if not altogether without discrimination .

		The only limitation that even looks like a distinction is in the language used by and to
Arthur	PERSON	.

		Of eighteen persons to whom he speaks , he uses ' thou ' alone to thirteen .

		The exceptions are Guinevere , to whom in '' Elaine '' he uses ' thou , ' ye , ' and ` you ' ;
Lynette	PERSON	, to whom he uses both ` thou ' and ' ye ' ;
Geraint	PERSON	, to whom he uses only ' ye ' ; and
Gawain	PERSON	, to whom he uses all three of the simple forms .

		Arthur uses ' ye ' and ' you ' in but three idyls ''
Elaine	PERSON	, '' '' The Last Tournament , '' and ''
Gareth	PERSON	and
Lynette	PERSON	. ''

		On the other hand , of eighteen persons who speak to
Arthur	PERSON	, only three use any pronoun but ' thou . '

		These are
Guine	PERSON	- vere , who uses all three , in '' Guinevere '' and '' The Last Tournament '' ;
Lancelot	PERSON	, who in '' Guinevere '' once uses ` you ' ; and
Gareth	PERSON	, who uses ` thou ' and ` ye . '

		I have examined the numerical balance in the case of Guinevere ,
Lancelot	PERSON	, and the others , but find no evident preference for one pronoun or another , and no distinction in their application .

		Without citing the many changes from one situation or speech to another , I will give a few illustrations of changes within one and the same speech .

		The first is from ''
Gareth	PERSON	and
Lynette	PERSON	, '' about 140 lines from the beginning , Bellicent speaking : '' Ay , go then , and ye must : only one proof , Before thou ask the King to make thee knight , Of thine obedience and thy love to me , Thy mother , I demand . ''

		Or again , about line 740 , Lancelot speaking : `` Nay , wherefore wilt thou go against the
King	LOCATION	, For that did never he whereon ye rail .

		But ever meekly served the King in thee . ''

		Again , some 95 lines further , the stranger baron speak - ing to Gareth : '' Good now , ye have saved a life Worth somewhat as the cleanser of this wood .

		And fain would I reward thee worehipfully .

		What guerdon will ye ? ''

		Finally , to pass from this idyl , about 108 lines from the end ,
Lynette	PERSON	speaking to Gareth : '' I curse the tongue that all thro ' yesterday Reviled thee , and hath wrought on Lancelot now To lend thee horse and shield : wonders ye have done ; Miracles ye can not : here is glory enow In having flung the three : I see thee maimed .

		Mangled : I swear thou canst not fling the fourth . ''

		It may be noted here that neither in
Gareth	LOCATION	and
Lynette	PERSON	, '' nor in ''
Geraint	PERSON	and Enid , '' nor in any other case in which there is an estrangement or a misunder - standing followed by a reconciliation , is there any change in the pronouns of address corresponding to the change in moods and relations .

		Similar passages could be quoted from almost any of the Idyls , but I will content myself with a few more examples , from '' The Last Tournament . ''

		Thus , in the third paragraph ,
Arthur	PERSON	to Guinevere : `` Peace to thine eagle-borne Dead nestling , and this honor after death , Following thy will !

		But , O my queen , I muse Why ye not wear on arm or neck or zone Those diamonds that I rescued from the tarn , And
Lancelot	PERSON	won , methought , for thee to wear . ''

		In her reply to this ,
Guinevere	LOCATION	, in addressing the
King	LOCATION	, uses all three pronouns in the course of twelve lines .

		And further on , in the dialogue between
Tristram	ORGANIZATION	and Dagonet , the latter says : '' Knight , an ye fling those rubies ronnd my neck In lien of hers , I 'll hold thon hast some touch Of music , since I care not for thy pearls .

		Swine , say ye ?

		swine , goats , asses , rams , and geese Trooped round a Paynim harper once , who thrummed On such a wire as musically as thou Some such fine song but never a king 's fool . ''

		The only case which is not to be found in the Idyls is that of two different pronouns in one and the same clause .

		But the only difference between an example like that in the heading of this note and those I have cited is that the solecism is more obvious the closer together the pronouns stand .

		I have asked myself how it was possible to read the Idyls , as I did for years , without being offended by this usage , which would certainly have annoyed me in a stu - dent or a lesser poet .

		My only explanation is that the spell of the splendid style was so strong upon me as to to blind me to such minor matters .

		310 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, gefco A MEMOIR OF DEAN L.IDDELL .

		* Dr.
Thompson	PERSON	modestly styles his compact and matterful memoir of the late Dean of Christ Church a compilation , inasmuch as its texture largely consists of letters to and from the Dean , together with recollections gathered from former friends and colleagues who are particularly well qualified to speak of him , and an autobiographical fragment treating of his earlier years and extending to
1834	DATE	.

		All this material , with just the necessary amplification , is marshalled with good judgment , largely in logical rather than chronological order , and with a sense of the uses and virtues of literary compression and editorial sifting that one duly appreciates in a day when overgrown biog - raphies are by no means exceptional .

		As a re - sult , we get a solid and satisfying volume of 280 clearly printed pages , from which readers even with little or no antecedent knowledge of Dean
Liddell	PERSON	can gain a just general concep - tion of his eminent services to classical schol - arship , and an edifying impression of his noble and stately , if somewhat frigid and awesome , personality .

		Henry
George Liddell	PERSON	was born on
February 6 , 1811	DATE	, at
Winchester	ORGANIZATION	, near
Auckland	LOCATION	.

		His father , then curate of the adjoining parish of
Southchurch	LOCATION	, was not long afterwards made Rector of Boldon , a village midway between
Stockton	PERSON	and
Newcastle	ORGANIZATION	, which thus became the home of his boyhood .

		He was early set on the high-road to his future distinctions . ''

		On my sixth birthday , '' he says , '' I was promised a great honor and reward .

		My father took me up into his study and inducted me into the mysteries of the Eton Latin Grammar . ''

		At twelve ,
Liddell	PERSON	was sent to
Charterhouse School	ORGANIZATION	, where he remained till
1829	DATE	.

		His Charthusian days were not pleasant ones -LRB- he recalls a letter to his father forcibly dated from '' Beastly Charterhouse '' -RRB- , nor , it would seem , very stren - uous ones , for a certain master , of a prophetic turn , used to say of him , coram publico , that he was '' as lazy as he was long , and should bring his father 's grey hairs in sorrow to the grave . ''

		While in the Sixth Form at Charter - house his desk-fellow was
Thackeray	PERSON	, who is the subject of some interesting passages .

New York	LOCATION	:
Heory Holt	PERSON	A Co , '' He never attempted to learn the lesson , never ex - erted himself to grapple with
Horace	PERSON	.

		We spent our time mostly in drawing , with such skill as we could command .

		-LSB- In later life -RSB- he often used to join Mrs.
Liddell	PERSON	and myself when riding in Rotten Row .

		On one occasion he turned to her and said : Your husband ruined all my prospects in life ; he did all my Latin verses for me , and I lost all opportunities of self - improvement ... ' At this time < Vanity Fair ' was coming out .

		He used to talk about it , and what he should do with the persons .

		Mrs.
Liddell	PERSON	one day said , < Ob , Mr.
Thackeray	PERSON	, you must let Dobbin marry Amelia . ' '

		Well , he replied , ' be shall ; and when he has got her , he will not find her worth having . ' ''

		Despite the dismal prediction of the master , and the trifling with
Thackeray	PERSON	,
Liddell	PERSON	left Charterhouse well trained in Greek and Latin , though within a narrow range of authors .

		In
1830	DATE	he went up to
Christ Church	ORGANIZATION	, and a long course of hard reading , rewarded from time to time by academic triumphs and substantial pre - ferments , followed .

		In
1833	DATE
Liddell	ORGANIZATION	gained a Double First Class in the Final Examination , and in
January , 1836	DATE	, he became Tutor , having in the interim worked hard at French and German , and at
Divinity	LOCATION	, for he had now made up his mind to enter Holy Orders .

		While Tutor , he first met
Ruskin	PERSON	, who speaks of him in his Praeterita , '' it may be remembered , as '' one of the rarest types of nobly-presenced Englishmen , '' and the only man in
Oxford	LOCATION	among the masters of my day who knew anything of art . ''

		We shall quote , later on , from an interesting letter of
Ruskin	PERSON	's to the Dean , one of several which form a valuable portion of the correspondence given by Dr.
Thompson	PERSON	.

		At
Christmas , 1836	DATE	,
Liddell	PERSON	was ordained .

		At this period the influence of
Newman	PERSON	and
Pusey	PERSON	was already a mighty and disturbing one at
Oxford	LOCATION	; and while it is clear that
Liddell	PERSON	was by no means swept away from his orthodox Anglican moorings by the powerful current of the Tractarian movement , it would be a mis - take to infer that he was not stirred by it , or that he was wholly proof against the spell of the great theologian of
Oriel	ORGANIZATION	.

		Though ten years
Newman	PERSON	's junior , he enjoyed some de - gree of intimacy with him , and he made at his request one or two of the translations from ancient documents which appeared in the '' Library of the Fathers . ''

		But
Liddell	PERSON	's tastes were at no time ecclesiastical , and he thor - oughly disliked controversy .

		His interest , therefore , in the clerical debates which so shook minds of a certain type was comparatively lan - guid that , we should say , of a perfunctorily sympathizing spectator who desired nothing so
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 311 much as the cessation of a quarrel the scandal of which to the common cause of religion was much more patent to secular and positive minds than the importance or essentiality of its grounds .

		In a sermon preached at
Christ Church	ORGANIZATION	in
1890	DATE	he recalled some memories of
Newman	PERSON	, and took occasion to add , in his liberal and clear-sighted way : '' But one thing I can not but notice , that , whereas most of those who leave the Church of their fathers , be it the Church of this realm or another , proved to be the bitterest enemies of that Church ,
Cardinal Newman	PERSON	never followed that unworthy course .

		He had convinced himself that there were things in our Church that he could not away with , and that he should find in the Roman Church a satisfaction and a cure .

		But he did not , therefore , as the manner of many is , assail us with acrimonious criticisms or contemptuous reproach ; and if at times he replied to attacks somewhat sharply , he seemed to do so in obedience to the imperious and inflexible principles of his new mistress . ''

		Contrasting the style of
Cardinal Newman	ORGANIZATION	with that of Dr.
Liddon	PERSON	,
Dean Liddell	PERSON	con - tinued : `` I seem to see
John Henry Newman	PERSON	standing -LRB- to use a familiar phrase -RRB- bolt upright in the pulpit , with spectacles on nose , with arms as it were pinned to his sides , never using the slightest action except to turn over the leaves of his sermon , trusting entirely for effect to the modulation of a voice most melodious , but rang - ing , I believe , through a very limited scale , yet rivetting the attention of his hearers as if they were spellbound .

		... We marvelled how so little apparent effort was followed by effects so great and permanent . ''

		In
1838	DATE	Liddell was appointed Greek Read - er in
Christ Church	ORGANIZATION	, and in
1845	DATE	he was elected
White 's Professor of Moral Philosophy	ORGANIZATION	.

		In
1846	DATE	his appointment as domestic Chaplain to the
Prince Consort	ORGANIZATION	opened the way to a friend - ship with the members of the royal family , which was evidenced in
1859	DATE	by the placing , at the Queen 's request , of the Prince of Wales under his charge at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.


Liddell	PERSON	was not , as may be readily believed , what is called a popular preacher not a preacher who could have drawn or swayed the crowds that flocked to hear
Spurgeon	PERSON	at the
Tabernacle	LOCATION	.

		What we may venture to term the cheaper rhet - orical arts of pulpit oratory were as foreign to his manner as to
Newman	PERSON	's .

		The effectiveness of his sermons was not of the evanescent sort that lies largely in graces of manner , witchery of voice , or what is known as magnetism of presence .

		They read well .

		His language , says Dr.
Thompson	PERSON	, '' was always severely simple , but never lacking in stateliness and beauty .

		He was rarely , if ever , controversial ; he de - sired to go beyond controversy , and exhibit Divine Truth in a more exalted relation . '' ''

		One of the most remarkable sermons I have ever listened to , '' Sir
Robert Peel	PERSON	was heard to say , while leaving the Chapel Royal , White - hall , where
Liddell	PERSON	had been preaching on the text , `` Stretch forth thy hand . ''


Liddell	PERSON	's marriage to Miss
Lorina Reeve	PERSON	, in
1846	DATE	, was followed by his resignation of his office , at
Oxford	LOCATION	, and his acceptance of the
Headinastership of Westminster School	ORGANIZATION	.

		This ancient foundation had latterly sunk into a declining and apparently moribund condition , and it was thought that the governance and reputation of a man like
Liddell	PERSON	would go far toward restoring its former prestige and num - bers .

		During his eleven years ' incumbency at
Westminster	LOCATION	,
Liddell	PERSON	did much to justify the confidence thus placed in him ; but he became convinced at last that the proximity of the school to
London	LOCATION	was a bar to its progress which could not be overcome ; and he was about to accept the
Mastership of Sherburn Hospital	ORGANIZATION	,
Durham	LOCATION	, when the death of Dean Glaisford , of
Christ Church	ORGANIZATION	, marked a sudden turn in his fortunes , which had not perhaps been entirely unforeseen .

		There was scarcely a doubt that
Liddell	PERSON	would be Dean
Glaisford	ORGANIZATION	's successor ; and on
June 6 , 1855	DATE	, a letter from Lord
Elcho	PERSON	notified him of his appointment by
Palmerston	LOCATION	to the office which he was to fill with such usefulness , , dig - nity , and distinction for a period of thirty-six years , or up to within six years of his death in
1898	DATE	.

		One-half of the memoir before us is devoted to an account of
Liddell	PERSON	's decanal career at
Christ Church	ORGANIZATION	, his constitutional and archi - tectural reforms , his methods and peculiarities of administration , his good work as
Curator of University Galleries	ORGANIZATION	, the battles on behalf of liberty fought by him and
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	in the Chapter largely an ultra-conservative body containing , said
Stanley	PERSON	, '' very explosive ele - ments . ''

		The
Jowett	PERSON	question is very briefly touched upon , as is that which arose over the
Boden Professorship of Sanscrit	ORGANIZATION	.

		In these and kindred academical issues
Liddell	PERSON	and
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	, it is hardly necessary to say , fought successfully the battle of reform and liberalism against what may be termed the conservative mandarinate of Christ Church . ''

		Fuit Ilium I '' one of these worthy , if mistaken champions of old-fogyism dolefully exclaimed , on realizing the uselessness of further resistance to the changes of
1858	DATE	, which have since proved so salutary .

		To revert to
Liddell	PERSON	's friendship with Rus - kin .

		This began in
Ruskin	LOCATION	's undergraduate days , and resulted in his acceptance , at Lid - 312 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, dell 's instance , of the
Slade Professorship	ORGANIZATION	at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		ID a letter of
1837	DATE	Liddell thus de - scribed the author of '' Modern Painters '' as he first knew him : '' He is a very strange fellow , always dressing in a greatcoat with a brown velvet collar , and a large neck - cloth tied over his mouth , and living quite in his own way among the odd set of hunting and sporting men that gentlemen commoners usually are .

		... I am glad to say they do not bully him , as I should have been afraid they would . ''

		In
1844	DATE	Ruskin wrote , in reply to a letter in which
Liddell	ORGANIZATION	seems to have made some complaints of the style of '' Modern Painters '' : `` But alas !

		there is nothing of all the little that you say in stricture which I do not feel and which I have not felt for some time back ... But it seems to me the pamphleteer manner is not confined to these passages : it is ingrained throughout There is a nasty , snappish , impatient , half-familiar , half-claptrap web of young-mannishness everywhere .

		I am going to try for better things ; for a serious , quiet , earnest , and simple manner , like the execution I want in art ... Do n't suppose , however , I am going to lose
Turner	ORGANIZATION	.

		On the contrary , I am more tpris than ever , and that especially with his latest works ,
Goldau	PERSON	, etc. .

		Monomania , you think .

		Possibly .

		... '' In a later letter ,
Ruskin	PERSON	goes on to say , as to '' versatility of admiration '' : '' The world is so old , that there is no dearth of things first-rate ; and life so short , that there is no excuse for looking at things second-rate .

		Let us then go to Rubens for blending , and to Titian for quality , of color ; to Cag - liari for daylight , and Rembrandt for lamplight ; to Buonarroti for awf illness , and to Van Huysum for pre - cision ... Any man is worthy of respect , in his own rank , who has pursued any truth or attainment with all his heart and strength .

		But I dread and despise the artists who are respectable in many things , and have been excelled by some one in everything ... Murillo seems to me a peculiar instance of this ... He was not a bad painter , but he exercises a most fatal influence on the English school .

		I have never entered the Dul - wich Gallery for fourteen years without seeing at least three copyists before the Murillos .

		I never have seen one before the
Paul Veronese	PERSON	. ''

		Perhaps Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	's unaccountably heated expression , '' I dread and despise , '' fairly ex - emplifies the defect of manner admitted in the earlier letter . ''

		Do n't bear on too hard '' urges Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	somewhere ; and we know of few maxims of the kind more useful than this one .

		A chapter is of course devoted to the history of the Dean 's magnum opus , the Greek-Eng -
lish Lexicon	PERSON	, a monument of labors begun in his student days and continued almost to the close of his life .


Liddell	PERSON	and
Scott	PERSON	are names that will long hunt in couples in the brain of student and scholar .

		The first edition of the Lexicon was issued in
1834	DATE	; but that date marks only the completion of the first stage in the undertaking .

		Through a period of fifty - four years the task of improving and correct - ing the work , of keeping it abreast of the ad - vance of modern scholarship , was never inter - mitted , the eighth edition being published in
1897	DATE	, ten years after
Scott	PERSON	's death , and only a few months before his venerable colaborer was called to his rest .

		Apropos of the Lexicon , and the inevitable defects of the first edition of it , let us subjoin a Westminster story , which is amusing enough in itself , and may serve the additional end of providing a key to proper pronunciation of the , we think , often mispro - nounced name of
Liddell	PERSON	.

		There was an irreverent schoolboy tradition current at West - minster in
Liddell	PERSON	's day that when , during class-work , an error would crop out in the
Lexicon	LOCATION	, the Headmaster would serenely ob - serve : '' Ah , yes ; Mr.
Scott	PERSON	wrote that para - graph . ''

		This gave rise to the following epi - gram which was heartily enjoyed and even pecuniarily rewarded by its dignified but kindly victim .

		`` Two men wrote a Lexicon ,
Liddell	PERSON	and
Scott	PERSON	; Some parts were clever , but some parts were not .

		Hear , all ye learned , and read me this riddle , How the wrong : part wrote
Scott	PERSON	, and the right part wrote
Liddell	PERSON	. ''

		Each of the several commanders who attempted to satisfy the carping critics was the target for the fire of every newspaper writer , jealous brother officer , and store-box tactician of the day .

		Hence many a reader of this volume will take the treatment accorded to
General McClellan	ORGANIZATION	as a test topic .

		For a time there is severe condemnation , until it seems that the author is too much prejudiced .

		Then comes a page where the opinion is moderated ; then criticism is harsh again , until it is apparent that the account of
McClellan	ORGANIZATION	is just what is most to be desired a judicious examination of his merits and demerits , with unsparing blame where he manifestly was at fault , with a due amount of recognition of those excellences which made him the idol of his soldiers and the chosen leader of a large minority of his fellow - citizens .

		The general impression of the story as a whole is unfavorable to
McClellan	PERSON	, and there is a natural query in the mind of the reader as to whether this result of the first serious attempt to write the history of the Civil War without passion , according to modern his - torical methods , and in connection with a survey of a wider period of the nation 's life , is to be taken as the final judgment upon the career of this famous soldier and party leader .

		The same impression of judicial fairness is gained from the account of the work of other men
Burnside	PERSON	,
Pope	LOCATION	,
Buell	PERSON	,
Halleck	PERSON	,
Hooker	PERSON	,
Meade	PERSON	, and Lee .

		In considering men and measures outside of military lines , also , this judicial tact has been displayed .


Stanton	PERSON	and
Chase	ORGANIZATION	,
Seward	PERSON	and Lincoln , are seen in the light of the time , as events developed and they developed with them .

		Even Lincoln stands forth as he was during this critical period of his administration , not viewed with the halo which late years have placed about him , but marked by weakness and faults , or elements of strength , as he displayed now one and now another quality in the midst of the tremendous cares of state .

		More difficult than the task of properly measuring the standard for general and cabinet officers and president was that of giving a fair account of the acts and influence of those par - tisan leaders in the North who differed from the ruling party in their ideas of the proper method of dealing with the rebelling states , men like
Seymour	PERSON	and
Vallandingham	PERSON	and others who were called '' Copperheads '' by the sup - porters of the government .

		While it is per - fectly apparent that the author believes that the Democratic party failed in what might have been its legitimate mission as a correcting and restraining party of opposition , and that many things which closely approached '' giving aid and comfort to the enemy '' are justly charged against it , there is a clear recognition of much that is of worth in some of the speeches of its leaders ; there is due praise especially for many of Governor
Seymour	PERSON	's acts ; and , on the other hand , there is unsparing condemna - tion of the illegal arrests and suppression of newspapers which attended the radical side of the controversies .

		What is most to be com - mended is the clearness of narration which enables the reader to see just how it came to pass that men could feel as they did at the time , whether they were `` Union Leaguers '' or `` Copperheads . ''

		There can be no doubt that the growing tendency in present-day discussions of the Civil War is to overlook the bitterness and harshness of the time , to feel that the triumph of the Union was demanded by destiny , to accept the downfall of human slavery as a result pleasing to both sides , and to exalt the heroism shown by Americans in battle , whether they fought under the stars or the bars .

		After a stirring account of
Pickett	ORGANIZATION	's charge at
Gettysburg	LOCATION	, one sentence claims attention : '' Decry war as we may and ought , ' breathes there the man with soul so dead ' who would not thrill with emotion to claim for his countrymen the men who made that charge and the men who met it ? ''

		The hopes , the fears , the strength , the weakness of the Confederacy find proper consideration , and again the reader feels that he is learning of things as they were at the time , that he shares the concern of the North or the confi - dence of the South , as the fortunes of war vary and Mars seems hostile to the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, until
Gettysburg	LOCATION	and
Vicksburg	LOCATION	bring rejoicing and 314 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, new zeal to the disheartened
Northland	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Rhodes	PERSON	's story of the critical years of the war is certainly a strong one as regards its treatment of men in the field and at
Washington	LOCATION	, its con - sideration of administration measures and the opposition thereto , its fairness toward the armed enemies of the government and to those who kept up a '' fire in the rear . ''

		Still another phase of the great conflict re - quired treatment : that was its diplomacy , notably with
England	LOCATION	.

		If one desires to know just how the ruling classes and the people of that country felt toward the contending sides , he need look no further .

		A good many pages are taken up with this discussion , from the time when English negligence allowed the `` Ala - bama '' to get to sea , until the leaders were forced by the logic of events to give up any plans which might have been considered for recognition of the Confederacy , as the
Emanci	LOCATION	- pation Proclamation found increasing favor and the feeling of sympathy manifested by the common people of
England	LOCATION	for the North grew in strength .

		The story is unfolded naturally , and in the proper sequence .

		The failure of the English government to respect our rights is plainly apparent , the anxiety of our minister is shared , the attitude of English leaders when they did a friendly act is indicated , and the acknowledgment of wrong and reparation made in connection with the
Geneva Award	LOCATION	are urged as reasons for forgiving those who as leaders of English thought and life took a mistaken position in our day of adversity .

		This fourth volume by Mr.
Rhodes	PERSON	is a strong one .

		It is convincing in style , and each im - portant conclusion is fortified by abundant reference in the form of foot-notes and quota - tions .

		The wealth of this illustrative mate - rial is partly indicated by the statement that only fifteen of the five hundred and thirty - nine pages of the text are without some sort of supplementary reference or helpful quo - tation .

		In some cases the notes discuss mat - ters not taken up in the text proper because of lack of space for the more extended treat - ment .

		Twelve maps supply the needed geo - graphical help .

		There are some matters of detail which might be criticised ; but taken as a whole , as a vol - ume in a series , and as a sober presentation of facts about a period of great excitement and passion , Mr.
Rhodes	PERSON	's latest contribution to American history is notable .

		* At three different dates -LRB-
1866	DATE	,
1882	DATE	, and
1898	DATE	-RRB- , Dr.
Georg Brandos	PERSON	has endeavored to interpret , for the large public which his writ - ings reach , the significance of the work of Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	.

		The first study was written just after '' Brand '' and '' Peer Gynt '' had led the way to the wide European fame that their author was henceforth to enjoy ; the second appeared just after '' Ghosts '' had fluttered to some pur - pose the dovecotes of a conventional society ; the third was a recognition of the commanding position that the great Norwegian had won for himself at the time of his seventieth birthday .

		These three studies , unrevised , although at some points inconsistent with each other in their judgments , have been published by the author in a single volume , and translated into English by Miss
Jessie Muir	PERSON	.

		At the same time , Miss
Mary Morison	PERSON	has made a transla - tion of the essay of Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	upon
Herr Bjornson	PERSON	, which was originally published with the second of the three studies above mentioned in the volume entitled ''
Moderne Gjennem	PERSON	- brudsmaend . ''

		The four essays thus described have been brought together in a volume to which Mr.
William Archer	PERSON	has given editorial supervision , and for which he has written an introduction .

		The first and third of the papers devoted to Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	are now for the first time put into English ; the second , together with the paper upon
Herr Bjbrnson	PERSON	, may be found m the volume called '' Men of the Modern Awaken - ing , '' being a selection from several collections of critical essays by Dr.
Braudes	PERSON	, translated by Professor
Rasmus B. Anderson	PERSON	, and published in this country thirteen years ago .

		The three essays upon Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	offer an extremely interesting study in critical method .

		They are '' a running commentary on
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's spiritual development , '' made by the most com - petent among living critics for such a task .

		The author , to quote from Mr.
Archer	PERSON	's introduction , '' Approached the study of the poet 's works with a perfectly free mind , neither overawed by a great ready - made reputation , nor warped into antagonism by secta - rian mispraise .

		His criticism throughout is absolutely candid .

		In the ' first impression , ' indeed , it is so largely unfavorable that the fact of their subsequent intimate friendship speaks volumes for the character of both men .

		... It is no eulogy of Ibsen that is here pre - sented to the English-speaking public .

		Some admirers of the poet may think the critic , at points , over - severe and perhaps even captious .

		Let them remember that absolute sincerity is of more importance than absolute HKNRIK IBSKN .

New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1899 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 315 correctness , even if correctness ' could fitly be predi - cated of any aesthetic judgment . ''

		As for Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	himself , he writes of his three studies in the following terms : '' It is well-known that
Henrik Ibsen	PERSON	completed his seventieth year on the
20th March , 1898	DATE	.

		I have , in commemoration of this anniversary , combined my first and second essays upon him with a third , which brings my account of his poetic labours down to our own day .

		Those who , in foreign countries , have discussed
Henrik Ibsen	PERSON	's poetic career , have , as a rule , been able to make a general survey of it before they wrote ... They have had the whole fabric of his life-work before them , and have deduced from it , as it were , a more or less correct picture of the master-builder .

		It may at some future time be interesting to see how the building was reflected in the mind of a contemporary who saw it come into being , and who , at a comparatively early time , was so situated as to be able from his impressions of the master-builder 's personality , to say a few words of guidance to students of his work . ''

		Evidences of a progressive broadening of out - look and enlightenment of view are frequent in these studies .

		Take , for example , the familiar attribution of pessimism to Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	's think - ing .

		In the first study , we read : '' Whatever the merits or defects of his productions , it is clear that we have here to deal with a poet who looks upon the life of the present day with the eye of a pessimist ... His gloomy way of looking at things makes him , in the first place , polemical ; for when he directs his gaze towards his own time , it presents to his eye sheer misery and guilt , and shows him the discord between what ought to be and what is .

		In the second place , it makes him bitter ; for when he turns his gaze on the ideal , he sees its destruction as inevitable , all higher living and striving as fruitless , and discord be - tween what ought to be , and what is , attainable . ''

		Now this judgment , be it remembered , was rendered in the face of '' Brand , '' whose teach - ing gives it the lie direct .

		If that great poem means anything , it means that the triumph of the ideal , not its destruction , is inevitable , and that what ought to be attainable may really become so if a few leaders of men will only eschew , like Brand , all dealings with the ac - cursed spirit of compromise . ''

		Brand '' is , in its essence , one of the most hopeful poems ever written .

		In the second study , Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	has come to this saner view .

		`` Sceptical as he -LSB- Ibsen -RSB- is , he does not actually doubt the possibility of happiness ... When he touches a social sore , as in ' The Pillars of Society , ' and else - where , it is always one of a moral nature .

		Some one is to blame for it .

		Whole strata of society are rotten , whole rows of society 's pillars are decayed and hollow .

		The close air of the small community is unhealthy ; in wide spheres there is room for great actions .

		A breath from without , that is to say a breath of the spirit of truth and liberty , has power to purify the atmosphere .

		... His pessimism is not of a metaphysical , but of a moral nature , and is based on a conviction of the possi - bility of realizing ideals ; it is , in a word , the pessimism of indignation . ''

		But this is not pessimism at all ; and the critic , rejecting the substance , should have rejected the term itself .

		Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	's mission has been that of the physician , to touch , like
Goethe	PERSON	, the weak spots of the social organism , saying , '' thou ailest here , and here , '' and to indicate the ways in which health may be restored .

		The preeminence of '' Brand '' among the works of Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	is as marked as that of '' Faust '' among the works of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, and the interest of any thoroughgoing discussion of the author must centre in his treatment of that difficult masterpiece .

		Unfortunately , the dis - cussion of '' Brand '' is found chiefly in the first , and consequently the least mature , of these three essays , and the result is disappointing .

		We are told that the author '' Is wholly and utterly carried away by his hero , whose one-sidedness it is , after all , his purpose to condemn .

		Ibsen has conjured up a spirit that he himself is power - less to control ... The last words of the poem carry with them no conviction ; for Brand has beaten every objection out of the field , and has already admirably refuted the charge which meets him at the moment of his death , the charge of not having understood that God is love . ''

		This closing scene has indeed been a stumbling - block to the commentators , for it seems at first sight to mean that Brand has been mistaken all along , and that his sufferings and sacrifices have been needless .

		But the evident sincerity and sympathy with which he has been por - trayed up to this point makes the conclusion seem stultifying , and leaves the reader sorely perplexed .

		Now , the explanation of this eth - ical antinomy is to be found in the philosophy of
Sbren Kierkegaard	PERSON	, and Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	, who has made a special study of this Danish theolo - gian , and who repeatedly refers to his influence over the poet , should have discovered the ex - planation .

		But that discovery has been left for an Englishman , Mr.
M. A. Stobart	PERSON	, who , in the
August	DATE	'' Fortnightly Keview , '' clears away the difficulty in the most triumphant man - ner .

		A more illuminating piece of criticism it has not often been our fortune to read .

		The following is the significant passage of the dis - cussion , arrived at after the life of Brand has been brought down to its closing episode : '' He has recognized and now finally vanquished the
Spirit of Compromise	ORGANIZATION	which latter is the tocsin drummed by
Kierkegaard	ORGANIZATION	's philosophy and annihi - lated his human Will .

		The struggle has been to the death , but he is victor .

		Surely the quantum satis of his Will has merited the redemption he has set himself to win for his race ?

		But it is only now , when his 316 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, Will has finally trampled on the last traces of human weakness , and he has definitely chosen his ' All or Nothing ' in preference to the tempter 's suggestions of earthly happiness with wife and child , that
Brand	ORGANIZATION	's conquest is complete .

		So , it is only now , that , accord - ing to
Kierkegaard	LOCATION	, he may expect to find the love , the mercy of his Creator .

		And it is only , therefore , at this , the last moment of his worldly existence , as he sinks before the rushing avalanche , that the answer to the desperate prayer of his whole life is vouchsafed to him , and , through the roaring thunder-cloud , the message there is no mistaking is proclaimed : the quantum satis of his Will has merited Redemption , and Brand knows that now , at last for him God is Dem caritatit I '' The views of Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	, as he takes up one play after another , and proceeds to examine it in the dry light of true philosophical intelli - gence , are always interesting , and in many instances informing as well .

		But we can not escape the feeling that many vital things have somehow eluded the critic 's vision , and the reader capable of understanding Ibsen at all , who should first approach him through the medium of this work , would find a great deal more than he had been led to expect .

		Miss
Elizabeth Robins	PERSON	, writing in an English review upon this very book , expresses our meaning perfectly when she says : '' I realise now that if I had waited for Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	to introduce the great Norwegian to me , I should not have pursued my new acquaintance far .

		I should have heard too much of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's idiosyncracy , and not enough of his fascination .

		I should have been warned that the poem of '' Brand , '' the great spiritual drama which had made my heart beat and the tears come , was borrowed from
Kierkegaard	LOCATION	, and hardly worth the borrowing . ''

		We think Miss
Robins	PERSON	over-harsh in the passage that comes soon afterwards , but it represents a point of view that must not be ignored in any discussion of the book before us .

		She says : M One turns away from these bald and doctrinaire 1 Impressions ' with a sense that there may be an ad - vantage in approaching a great poet without the assist - ance of ' a critical intelligence of the first order . '

		One recalls with a flush of gratitude the quick uplifting that came of personal contact with the plays that Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	sets himself to dissect .

		The critic gives no smallest hint , to my sense , of the flashing vitality , the bitter wit , the tenderness so deep and innig that it moves one first to tears and then to feel all tears should be straightway dried in a world where such infinite gentleness had found a voice .

		If it depended on Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	, few would guess that the plays were more than philosophic discussions upon social life . ''

		These words , in our opinion , show a deeper insight into the poet 's mind than any that Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	accomplished critic and scholar though he be has written upon the subject .

		We are inclined to think it was a mistake to add the Bjb ` rnson essay to this volume .

		For one thing , it was already accessible in English , and for another , it is incomplete and inadequate , suggesting an appendix instead of a companion study .

		The most fitting words that Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	has written about the relations of his two sub - jects occur at the close of the second Ibsen study .

		< It seems to me that
Bjornson	PERSON	and Ibsen may be compared to the two old Norwegian kings ,
Sigurd	PERSON	and
Eystein	PERSON	, who , in the famous legendary conversation appropriated by
Bjornson	PERSON	in '
Sigurd Jorsalfar	PERSON	, ' boast to each other of their merits .

		The one has stayed at home and civilized his country , the other has left it , wandered far and wide , and gained honour for it on his wild and arduous journeying * .

		Each has his admirers , each his contentious band of followers , who exalt the one at the expense of the other .

		But they are brothers , although they have for a time been at variance ; and the only right thing to happen and it does happen at the end of the play is the peaceable division of the kingdom between them . ''

		These are fair and true words , truer than their author now thinks them , since he is at pains to take them back when he comes to his third estimate of Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	.

		It would have been better to leave Eystein-Bjbrnson out of this book altogether than to deal with him as a writer of secondary importance .

		We are by no means sure that , when the final critical ac - count is made up at some time in the
twentieth century	DATE	, his fame will not shine even more re - splendent than that of his great contemporary .

		1899 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 317 sive travels by the Governor over his vast province , and is a mine of recent information on the country , population , and industries , containing also histor - ical notes of value .

		The author evidently has at heart the well-being and development of northern
Russia	LOCATION	, and works to this end with enlightened energy .

		Further , there is evidence in this volume of a kindly consideration and a genial humor , qual - ities which are popularly supposed to be lacking in a Russian governor .

		The following example may be quoted : '' Our solicitude for the
Samoyedes of Novaia Zemlia	ORGANIZATION	extended even to such details as the following .

		The settlers included a brother and sister , both grown up , and , in answer to the usual queries as to what articles they were in need of , the one requested , among other things , a wife , and the other a husband .

		As these were not forthcoming , with the consent of their parents we brought out with us a bridegroom and a bride .

		Each having been duly introduced to his or her partner , I gave them an hour to become better acquainted with each other , after which the weddings were immediately to take place .

		The young
Novaia Zemlian Samoyede	PERSON	was pleased with the bride we brought him , and she , in her turn , with him ... But not so with the other .

		The Novaia Zemlian bride would have nothing to do with the bridegroom of our choosing .

		Do you call him a Samoyede ? '

		she cried . '

		He 's never killed a white bear !

		Why , my little brother , who 's only twelve years old , has killed several , and I myself even have shot over a score of wild deer .

		And what has he been do - ing ?

		Killing tame reindeer !

		No , I wo n't have him ! '

		And she was as good as her word , the more we tried to persuade her , the more she insisted ; nothing we could urge could prevail on her to have him , so our match - making was not altogether a success .

		The unlucky bridegroom non-elect could only pull a long face and retire ! ''

		This volume well illustrates in many details the paternal methods by which
Russia	LOCATION	has been so suc - cessful in dealing with inferior alien races .

		There are a number of interesting notes on natural his - tory ; but we should like better evidence than reports as to the wild ducks which become so accustomed to having their eggs removed by the natives that if '' an odd duckling or two begin to peep out of their shells , the old ones immediately drag them forth and hurl them into the water , '' and also as to the kind of shark that '' feeds chiefly on human flesh . ''

		The book contains a number of useful maps and illustrations . ''

		Holland and the Hollanders , '' by Mr.
David S. Meldrum	PERSON	, is an agreeably written description of the country and people .

		The opening chapters are given to impressions of the
Holland	LOCATION	of to-day ; while later chapters tell of the government , of the dykes , of education , and of the state of affairs in the sev - eral provinces .

		One of our author 's impressions is that `` Too much is made of the Dutch rage for cleanliness .

		The village of
Broek	ORGANIZATION	, to which the tourist is sent flying by the guides , to see this na - tional virtue in its most ridiculous exhibitions , is a standing joke among the Hollanders themselves .

		The explanation of all this scrubbing and polishing and painting , as of almost all the characteristics of the Dutch , is the superabundance of water . ''

		This explanation , it must be granted , he finds only par - tial .

		This work is useful as a popular book , and contains a number of interesting illustrations . ''


Tunisia	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Herbert Vivian	PERSON	, contains the impressions acquired by a conservative and some - what prejudiced Englishman during a brief sojourn in that
Barbary State	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Vivian	PERSON	has very little that is good to say of the French in
Tunis	LOCATION	, as is rather vividly intimated by his secondary title , '' and the Modern Barbary Pirates . ''

		He thinks that '' the administration of
Tunisia	LOCATION	is as rotten as that of the French Republic . ''

		As we are inclined to suspect the fairness of the book in some respects , so also the information is sometimes suspicions , as when he declares that '' the Arabs have a curious charac - teristic in common with horses and many other ani - mals .

		They prefer stagnant water , however disgust - ing in smell and appearance , to the most limpid running water . ''

		So also he informs us that it is a cus - tom in the American army to bury all mules who fall in battle with military honors .

		However , the author gives many pleasant descriptions of the land and of the people Moslems , Jews , and '' niggers '' as in this of the street story-teller : '' First he collected his audience in a circle around him by much banging of his tambourine .

		Then he pro- ceeded to spin the most marvellous yarns , only stopping to collect pennies when he reached a climax of excite - ment , and perceived that his hearers were burning to know what happened next to the princess , or the Jinn , or the enchanted casket .

		He reminded me of the sen - sational magazines , which always take care to close the instalments of their serials at the most breathless situ - ations .

		When he had collected as much as he fancied would be volunteered by his hearers , he would count up the total and announce that he must have so many more pence before revealing another syllable of the story .

		He was generally as good as his word , and it was the most inquisitive part of his audience which had to pay . ''

		While this work is far from being impartial or thor - oughgoing , it is readable and fresh , and the many photographic illustrations add to the interest .

		Mr.
Charles Dana Gibson	PERSON	, in his `` Sketches in
Egypt	LOCATION	, '' gives us in breezy style by pen and pencil his impressions of
Cairo	LOCATION	and the usual tourist trip up the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	to the first cataract .

		The brief text is written in a light , airy vein , often approaching the flippant ; but , of course , the illustrations are the chief excuse for the volume .

		We confess that Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	does not seem to us at his happiest here .

		Occasionally , as on pages 9 , 22 , 94 , the drawings show his best characteristic touch ; but in the main they are rather weak and flat , and often made worse by poor printing .

		Mr.
Charles Neufeld	PERSON	's '' A Prisoner of the Kha - leefa '' is a companion book to
Slatin	PERSON	's '' Fire and Sveord in the Soudan , '' being a narrative of capture , imprisonment , and slavery among the Mahdists .

		But it suffers in comparison with Mr.
Slatin	PERSON	's work , 318 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, for it is quite lacking in picturesquenest and breadth of view , and in all qualities of style ; and , besides , it is too summary , and too much a mere personal vindication , to be of the highest interest and value .

		Yet the rather bald and brief account of each re - markable experiences among so remarkable a peo - ple can not fail to be of considerable interest and value .

		Certainly , whenever the author forgets him - self , and speaks in some objective way of the native and his surroundings , he can be both entertaining and instructive , as , for example , in his description of the arrangement of marriages between prisoners and jailers .

		The ferocity , mendacity , avarice and cruelty of the MahdisU are drawn in even blacker lines than by Mr.
Slatin	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Nenfeld	PERSON	was in irons for practically the whole time of his captivity . ''

		For ten years I had been so chained and weighted with iron that it was only with effort I was able to raise my feet from the ground in order to shuffle from place to place ; the bars of iron connected with the anklets had limited the stride or shuffle to about ten or twelve inches . '

		When freed from all this , I ran and jumped about the whole day long like one possessed ; but the sudden call upon the muscles so long unused resulted in a swelling of the legs from hips to ankles , and this was accompanied with most excruciating pains . ''

		No doubt many of
Neofeld	ORGANIZATION	's extraordinary hard - ships were due to wrong-headedness and hot-head - edness , as , indeed , he sometimes acknowledges .

		The author had much to do with the natives in a medical way , and thus notes their insensibility to pain , apropos of extracting a bullet from the arm of a Soudanese with a penknife : `` Maybe , with a European , chloroform might have been necessary for the extraction of the bullet in the arm ; but with a Soudanese have I not already said that a dervish can continue leaping and stabbing with half a dozen severe wounds in his body ?

		A dervish can and will kill at the moment when the ventricles of his heart make their last contraction .

		Bodily pain , as we understand it , is unknown to them .

		Many a time have I applied , and seen applied , red-hot charcoal to sores , with the patients calmly looking on . ''

		Mr.
Neufeld	PERSON	believes it was a mistake to grant any quarter to wounded dervishes .

		The book has a number of useful illustrations , maps , sketches , and appendices . ''

		Enchanted
India	LOCATION	, '' by Prince
Karageorgevitch	PERSON	, is a series of slight artistic sketches , or literary etchings , descriptive of the native life in the great centres of
India	LOCATION	.

		As an example , we may instance this sketch of native soldiery : '' Some native lancers were manoeuvring ; they charged at top speed in a swirl of golden dust , which transfig - ured their movements , making them look as though they did not touch the earth , but were riding on the clouds .

		They swept lightly past , almost diaphanous , the colour of their yellow khaki uniforms mingling with the ochre sand ; and then , not ten yards off , they stopped short , with astonishing precision , like an apparition .

		Their lances quivered for an instant , a flash of steel sparks against the sky a salute to the Maharajah and then they were as motionless as statues . ''

		Another book on
India	LOCATION	, of quite a different type , is '' From the Himalayas to the Equator , '' by
Bishop Cyrus Foss	PERSON	.

India	LOCATION	and

		Mr.
M. M. Shoemaker	PERSON	's `` Quaint Corners of Ancient Empires '' is a series of brief sketchy chap - ters made by the quick-passing traveller in
Southern India	LOCATION	,
Burma	LOCATION	, and
Manila	LOCATION	.

		It hardly deserves its title , save , perhaps , in the case of the chapter on
Rameswaram	LOCATION	, '' the most venerated , the most mag - nificent , and the largest of Hindoo temples , situated on a lonely sandy island close under the shores of
Southern India	LOCATION	. ''

		One corridor of this temple he describes as a thousand feet long .

		In fact , all the shrines of the world shrink into insignificance as one stands gazing down the vast spaces of Rames - waram . ''

		He has much also to say of the temples of
Burma	LOCATION	.

		The author was in
Manila	LOCATION	in
January	DATE	of this year , but his observations of this region are of the slightest .

		While this work is hasty and su - perficial , it is fairly readable , and the illustrations are of some interest '' Intimate
China	LOCATION	, '' by Mrs.
Archibald Little	PERSON	, ia a large , finely manufactured and illustrated book , which fairly justifies its title , as being a close study based on long and varied experience .

		The author is well acquainted with
Pekin	LOCATION	, and has made sev - eral tours in far western
China	LOCATION	, even being so ad - venturous as to penetrate into Chinese Tibet .

		Very vivid and interesting are her sketches of crowded city life , as in her note on the '' All-pervading babble , row I had almost called it , of the boys in the schools , here , there , and everywhere , so that it is almost impossible to get out of earshot of ` them , all at the top of their boy voices shouting out the classics , as they painstakingly day after day and year after year commit them to memory .

		With the sickly sweet smell of the opium , and to the sound of the vast ear-drum-splitting army of
China	LOCATION	's schoolboys , all must forever associate life in a Chinese city . ''

		So , again , she notes her plan for subduing the crowds that annoyed her : `` So I tried my old plan , the only one I have ever found effectual with a Chinese crowd , and , getting out of the chair , standing quite still , looked solemnly and sadly at first one , then another , till he wished the ground would cover him and retired .

		I fancy glasses heighten the effect .

		Anyway , they all sat down , each hiding behind the other as far as he could . ''

		Mrs.
Little	PERSON	writes throughout in a very open-minded , fair and sympathetic way , and the book is to be cordially recommended both for information and entertainment . ''

		BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS .

		Methods and The first volume of an important materials of work that will be welcome to all stu - literary criticism .

		dent8 Q -LCB- literature has just been pub - lished .

		The work is a product of the joint schol - arship of Professors
Charles Mills Gayley	PERSON	and
Fred Newton Scott	PERSON	, and is entitled '' An Introduction to the Methods and Materials of Literary Criticism '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- .

		The sub-title of the present volume is '' The Bases in ^ Esthetics and Poetics . ''

		A second volume dealing with '' Literary Types '' will com - plete the work .

		Literary criticism , say the authors , has now '' outgrown the stage of unquestioning ac - quiescence in tradition , authority , personal bias or prejudice .

		But it is not yet fully alive to its possi - bilities , scope , or aim , not organized . ''

		An attempt at such organization is what this work offers us . ''

		The objects more directly aimed at in this volume , and that which will shortly follow it , are , first , to give the reader his orientation by showing the rela - tions of literature to art , criticism , aesthetics , and the contributory sciences , and by displaying the solidarity and scope of literature ; second , to con - sider the main types or forms which literature has assumed in the course of its development ; third , to trace the movement and determine the law of liter - ary waves or fashions ; and last , to deduce from these considerations the principles which should guide us in critically estimating given literary pro- ducts . ''

		Of this ambitious programme , only the '' orientation '' is dealt with in the present volume .

		Each of its seven chapters embraces -LRB- 1 -RRB- a discus - sion of such problems as the topic in hand presents for consideration , -LRB- 2 -RRB- a comprehensive bibliography , with critical commentary on each important refer - ence , -LRB- 3 -RRB- suggestions for special investigation .

		The chapters have for their several subjects the '' Nature and Function of Literary Criticism , '' the ''
Princi	PERSON	- ples of Literature , '' '' The Theory of Poetry , '' '' The Historical Study of Poetics , '' and '' The
Prin	PERSON	- ciples of Versification . ''

		The authors add this note to the exposition of their plan : '' While the work is not intended to set forth any special system or criticism , being rather a clue to the sources which will acquaint the student with any or all systems , yet some pains has been taken to distinguish , in the commentary , those theories which are thought to rest upon a sound scientific and aesthetic basis . ''

		The result of all this industry is not , indeed , a book to be read , but a book to be used as a guide through the labyrinth of critical literature ; and in this re - spect the bibliographical sections are by far the most important , being prepared with great thoroughness , and embracing classified references to the most im - portant work to be found in all the culture-lan - guages .

		As has already been observed , the aim of the work is mainly that of guidance and suggestion rather than of elaborating a critical system ; but we should supplement this statement by saying that the modern scientific or evolutionary treatment of liter - ature is the underlying principle of the whole dis - cussion , a fact which comes out clearly in the section dealing with '' Comparative Literature . ''

		We are bound to compliment the authors of this volume upon their scholarship and their fairness in present - ing contrasted opinions , and to thank them most heartily for placing in our hands a manual of the subject that goes far beyond anything hitherto attempted in English , and that is simply invaluable for purposes of reference .

		M. Imbert de Saint -
Amand	ORGANIZATION	's latest volume ,
France	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Scrib	PERSON	- ner -RRB- , deals with that annus mirabi - lis of modern Italian history ,
1859	DATE	, the year of
Louis Napoleon	PERSON	's '' Sardinian adventure '' -LRB- a games - ter 's throw , we should say , rather than a quixotic - ally generous enterprise in political knight-errantry -RRB- , with its tragic episodes of
Magenta	LOCATION	and
Solferino	LOCATION	, and its , for
Sardinia	LOCATION	and
Cavour	PERSON	, somewhat abor - tive issue at
Villafranca	LOCATION	.

		In his curious and very characteristic foreword -LRB- characteristically French , we mean -RRB- , M. Saint-Amand calls upon his country - men to contemplate the triumphs of that '' swift and joyous '' -LRB- ! -RRB-

		war of
1859	DATE	, and to seek in its memo - ries a lenitive for those of
1870	DATE	.

		`` Our misfortunes , '' he philosophically says , '' occupy our minds too much ; we do not think enough about our glories .

		Hypnotized by the memory of our disasters , we lose sight of triumphs , the record of which is , neverthe - less , preeminently adapted to fortify the military sentiment which is the hope and consolation of
France	LOCATION	. ''

		One would think that the obviously wise thing for
France	LOCATION	to do now , in view of the evil and humiliation which that same '' military sentiment '' has brought upon her , would be to weaken and sup - plant it , rather than to fortify it , and to find '' hope and consolation , '' not in the prospect of a bloody revanche upon the power she wantonly provoked beyond endurance in
1870	DATE	, but in that of a national future serene in the substantial blessings of wide - THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, spread prosperity and well-being , and illustrious in those higher arts of peace and civilization which she has already done so much to heighten and adorn .

		How much better to contemplate a future like that painted by
Condorcet	LOCATION	, the noblest victim of the Revolution , than one which shall repeat the specious glories of Napoleonic days !

		Is not the Napoleonic legend , for
France	LOCATION	, a Upas tree , rooted in a soil that was fattened with the blood of a sturdy and virile generation of her sons whose untimely cutting off is the secret of her admitted physical degeneracy to-day ?

		Further , if
France	LOCATION	's ideal and summmn bonum of aspiration must still be , as
M. Saint	PERSON	- Amand quietly assumes , military glory , is there not just now clearly a more practical and necessary busi - ness for her to look to than the mere feeding of her imagination on the memories of Magenta and Sol - f erino ?

		What of the present condition of the instru - ment by which future Magentas and Solferinos are to be won ?

		The achievements of an army officered largely by such men as stood the other day in the pillory at
Rennes	ORGANIZATION	will hardly be of a nature to erase the recollections and heal the smarts of Sedan .

		M. Saint-Amand is a swift , brilliant , and sympa - thetic narrator , a capital painter of historical pic - tures , a shrewd judge of men and motives ; and the present volume is one of the best of the popular series of historical studies which has made his name a familiar one to American readers .

		M. Saint -
Amand	ORGANIZATION	is particularly happy in his citations from the authorities , and his books are a veritable mine in that sort .

		The great diplomatic and military events of
1859	DATE	are nowhere more brilliantly and en - tertainingly if slightly sketched than in this volume .

		The illustrations comprise portraits of Victor Em - manuel ,
MacMahon	PERSON	,
Francis Joseph	PERSON	, and
Cavour	PERSON	.

		vals , and whose thought is allowed to ripen before it takes the garb of print .

		When he does speak , whether in verse or prose , we know that he is giv - ing us of his best , and that best has a quality too rarely met with in this age of hurried and voluble speech .

		The four papers to which '' Heart of Man '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is given as a collective title are seemingly diverse in their themes the first a descriptive and historical essay on `` Taormina , '' another , '' A New Defence of Poetry , '' another a disquisition upon '' Democracy , '' and the last , '' The Ride , '' a collection of philosophical jottings from a thinker 's note-book . ''

		The intention of the author was to illustrate how poetry , politics , and religion are the flowering of the same human spirit , and have their feeding roots in a common soil , ' deep in the general heart of men . ' ''

		It is in this sense , and in the common possession of that high seriousness which is so greatly needed in literature , that these essays have claim to unity ; this we feel more and more as the impression of their fine idealism becomes deep - ened page by page .

		Here is a writer with the firmest of faith in the things of the spirit , to whom poetry is as the bread of life , to whom democracy is the earthly hope of men , '' to whom religion is no mere affair of observance but the name which we give to the most sacred aspirations of the soul .

		And the writer 's message upon these high matters is delivered in a style of such exquisite simplicity , such grateful cadence , such finished art , that we take new hope for the nation that can still raise up such voices to express its nobler moods .

		The message , to quote the author 's own words , is '' blended of many voices of the poets whom
Shelley	PERSON	called , whatever might be their calamity on earth , the most fortunate of men ; it rises from all lands , all ages , all religions ; it is the battle-cry of that one great idea whose slow and hesitating growth is the un - folding of our long civilization , seeking to realize in democracy the earthly , and in Christianity the heavenly , hope of men , the idea of the commu - nity of the soul , the sameness of it in all men . ''

		It seems a pity to descend to minute criticism of a volume so deserving of praise , but we must note two minor slips , one made in quoting '' the rack of this tough world , '' which memory tricked the writer into calling this rude world . ''

		and one made in attributing the discovery of Uranus to
Leverrier	PERSON	instead of to
Herschel	PERSON	.

		What is really meant is the discovery of
Neptune	LOCATION	by
Leverrier	PERSON	and
Adams	PERSON	.

		By the translation of two of the earlier plays of
M. Rostand	PERSON	, our reading public has a chance to esti - mate more fully than it could hitherto the power of the author of '' Cyrano de Bergerac . '' ''

		Les Ro - manesques '' is translated by
Mips Mary Hendee	ORGANIZATION	under the title `` The Romancers '' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- ; `` La Princesse Lointaine '' is translated by Mr.
Charles Renauld	PERSON	-LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- .

		We think that , con - trary to the usual expectation in such cases , these earlier works will add to the reputation of their author .

		Not that they are as fine plays as
M. Rostand	PERSON	's famous masterpiece , but each is in its own way so very good that we gain from them a higher opinion of their author . ''

		Les Romanesques '' is , and was intended to be , no more than a charm - ing trifle , whimsical , original , poetic .

		It tones more than the other in the translation , perhaps necessa - rily ; but what is left has a quality , a poetic charac - ter , in which we find an echo , or really a premoni - tion , of the contagions exuberance which sometimes breaks out in the
Gascon	PERSON	hero of the later play . ''

		La Princesse Lointaine , '' however , is more than charming : it has real beauty .

		It is by no meant surprising that
M. Coquelin	PERSON	, when he heard it read , had the confidence in the author which called forth `` Cyrano de Bergerac . ''

		It has the same charac - teristic : it is a real , a serious idea , etherealized into a delicate poetic form .

		The play has not , we should say , the power of construction of
M. Rostand	PERSON	's masterpiece , but this note of reality in all the ex - travagance of romance it does have .

		It may re - mind one of `` Tristan nnd Isolde '' some of the The earlier play i of M.
Rutland	LOCATION	.

		1899 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 321 circumstances , some of the motives are the same and if so , the striking power of
M. Rostand	PERSON	will probably appear .

		In '' Tristan '' we have an ideali - zation of passion than which it would seem nothing could go further .

		In the `` Princesse , '' however , we have an embodied apprehension of the real mo - tive power of life -LRB- in the romancer 's ethic -RRB- , which appears to be something better .

		The play is not dramatically so strong as '' Tristan , '' for it is not so ably thought out or put into form : it seems to us to fall off a little toward the end .

		But in it
M. Rostand	PERSON	grasped an idea , an idea which enabled him to see the things he makes us see in '' Cyrano de Bergerac . ''

		The two translations are good , but not remarkable ; that of '' La Princesse Lointaine '' seems the better , but both can be read with pleas - ure .

		We should now like to see a translation of '' La Samaritaine . '' ''

		Fisherman 's Luck '' and other stories .

		The right flavor of the essay , as a specific form of composition , pleas - antly prevades most of the dozen charming papers contained in Dr.
Henry Van Dyke	PERSON	's `` Fisherman 's Luck '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		The initial pa - per gives title to the volume .

		Other titles are '' The Thrilling Moment , '' '' Taxability , '' `` A Wild Straw - berry , '' '' Fishing in Books , '' `` A Lazy , Idle Brook , '' `` A Norwegian Honeymoon , '' `` A Fatal Success , '' etc. .

		Dr.
Van Dyke	PERSON	, naturally , has his say on
Walton	PERSON	; and here , let us add , it occurs to us that if any one of our writers deserves to be dubbed '' the American Walton '' it is the Doctor .

		The pisca - torial habit he has in the due degree ; and there is more than a little of the peculiar Waltonian charm of freshness and gayety the unaffected joy in the things of nature that form the setting , the sweet and wholesome environment , of the angler 's pursuit , in bis pages .

		Dr.
Van Dyke	PERSON	finds that only two writers have spoken ill of Walton : the envious imitator Franck , and Lord
Byron	PERSON	.

		But there was a third detractor , a very savage one ,
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	, who inveighed against
Izaak	ORGANIZATION	's cruelty to the fish and , he might have added , to the creatures he used as bait .

		And certainly some of
Piscator	ORGANIZATION	's direc - tions to his `` loving scholar '' as to the proper mode of impaling frogs and worms and minnows , so as to keep them writhing in torture on the hook and hence enticing to the fish , are , when broadly and unpisca - torially viewed , rather shocking .

		Once he posi - tively jests over the process .

		Telling how to put a frog on the hook , he ironically adds , '' and in so doing , use him as though you loved him , that is , harm him as little as you may possibly , that he may live the longer '' Whereat Hunt is moved to say : `` Now fancy a Genius fishing for us .

		Fancy him baiting a great hook with pickled salmon , and twitching up old
Izaak Walton	PERSON	from the banks of the river
Lea	PERSON	, with the hook through his ear .

		How he would go up , roaring and screaming , and thinking the devil had got him ! ''

		But these are unpleasant reflections for the angler , who , however contem - plative a man he may be , can hardly in the nature of things go over to the fishes ' point of view and re - main an angler .

		Dr.
Van Dyke	PERSON	's book is written in his pleasantest and most characteristic vein , and is sure of its welcome .

		The publishers have given it a comely setting , the illustrations forming a tempting feature of the work .

		Dr.
Norman Bridge	PERSON	's little book on `` The Penalties of Taste '' -LRB-
H. S. Stone & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is one that does not give a very clear account of itself , so far , at least , as the title is concerned .

		It consists of six essays , and is named from the first of them .

		But this first essay , although quite characteristic in tendency and treatment , is not as obviously so in title .

		We incline to think that had the book been called '' The Nerves of the Modern Child '' it would have given a better idea of itself ; namely , that it is a collection of studies on some aspects of modern life by one who looks at the question chiefly -LRB- and with good right -RRB- from the standpoint of modern psychology and neu - rology .

		Such , at any rate , the book is : six essays , on the two subjects named , and on Bashfulness , Heredity , Conscience , and Education , or , more exactly , on some aspects of these topics .

		It is a very suggestive volume ; we have read it with interest , and recommend it to anyone who is study - ing current human nature .

		We find one matter , however , to note : namely , a certain lack of coor - dination between writer and reader .

		The writer , for instance , has in mind the commonplaces of modern physiology , but he does not seem to remem - ber that most readers have not ; on the other hand , he has not in mind a good deal of reading which readers nowadays are likely enough to have .

		Thus , Dr. Bridge assumes an acquaintance with the cell - theory : the average reader knows that there are such things as cells , but has very little exact knowl - edge of them and therefore does not realise allu - sions .

		On the other hand , Dr. Bridge writes of the '' collective conscience , '' without any reference to previous speculation on the matter ; but , probably , everyone now has read , in some more or less popu - larized form , of the '' psychology of the crowd . ''

		For the reason , then , that one has oneself to do most of the coordination with previous ideas , these essays are a little hard to read , unless one is con - tent to get from them the temporary stimulus that always comes from the working of an original mind turned upon interesting subjects .

		The special features of the attractive newr edition , in two moderate sized volumes , of '' The Reminiscences and Recollections of Captain Gronow '' -LRB-
Scribner	ORGANIZATION	's im - portation -RRB- are the full indices to each volume , and the 32 illustrations copied and adapted from con - temporary sources by Mr.
Joseph Grego	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Grego	PERSON	's pictures add decidedly to the piquancy and graphic quality of the book .

		There is no need now to dwell at length on
Gronow	PERSON	.

		His business in life was , as he and his kind phrase it , to '' know every - 322 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, body and to go everywhere '' ; and his book shows how even the smallest of God 's creatures has its serious uses .

		Dandy , quidnunc , and fashionable idler ,
Gronow	PERSON	had perhaps the largest circle of fashionable acquaintance of any man of his time in
Europe	LOCATION	; and he Boswellized his circle .

		As some men collect china , or prints , or first editions , so
Gronow	PERSON	collected stories stories illustrative of the ways and eccentricities of people talked about in the beau monde , from great luminaries like
Wellington	LOCATION	,
Byron	PERSON	,
Tallyrand	LOCATION	,
Latnartine	LOCATION	, or Peel , down to social star-dust or mere eccentrics like
Brummel	PERSON	and
Romeo Coates	PERSON	.

		Many of the stories were
Gronow	PERSON	's own ; and he prided himself on pos - sessing the correct and authentic versions of certain current but warped or exaggerated anecdotes
Brummel	PERSON	's alleged request to the Prince '' to ring the bell , '' for instance , which
Gronow	PERSON	, with the air and authority of a
Grote	PERSON	or a
Mommsen	LOCATION	, shows to have been , like so many accepted accounts of much weightier matters , a myth with a tincture of fact .

		Gronow was , beyond compare , the best stocked raconteur of his time ; and in a philanthropic mo - ment he determined to write a book , to bequeath , as it were , to posterity the wonderful store of racy personalities and anecdotal bric-ii-brar he had spent his life in amassing .

		This book , one of the most entertaining of its kind , and already an instructive picture of the manners and morals of the world it paints , will grow in a certain historical value as time goes on .

		History could ill spare its Walpoles and its Gronows .

		Too much chaff is undoubtedly min - gled with
Gronow	PERSON	's grain , but he will continue to be read and cited and to wax in authority , in his small kind ; and the present edition of him is attractive , convenient , and at all points satisfying .

		`` A Short History of Free Thought , Ancient and Modern '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
John M. Robertson	PERSON	, is a work that has no close parallel among previous publica - tions , although
Lange	PERSON	's '' History of Materialism '' covers a considerable part of the same ground .

		The distinction between the two books is that
Lange	PERSON	deals especially with general philosophic problems , while Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	's work has for its subject the '' revision or rejection of current religious doctrines by more or less practical people . ''

		Freethought is defined by our author as `` a conscious reaction against some phase or phases of conventional or traditional doctrine in religion on the one hand , a claim to think freely , in the sense not of disre - gard for logic but of special loyalty to it , on prob - lems to which the past course of things has given a great intellectual and practical importance ; on the other hand , the actual practice of such thinking . ''

		Armed with this definition , the author proceeds to survey the history of intellectual endeavor , all the way down from primitive man to the latest living champions of rationality against superstition .

		It is an inspiring subject , this history of the torch-bearers of the intellect , of the secular struggle of truth against error ; but the scope of the work is so vast that rhetorical adornments have to be suppressed , or at best merely indicated , and even then this short history '' fills a stout volume of nearly five hundred pages .

		It must be confessed that the work has a strong bias toward naturalism as against su - pernaturalism , and the author sometimes strains a point for the purpose of counting some great thinker or man of action upon his side .

		He is also conspic - uously unsympathetic in dealing with certain of his opponents .

		But his book is nevertheless a welcome contribution to the intellectual history of mankind , welcome to the general reader for its perspicuity of statement and to the scholar for its industrious mar - shallings of facts and references .

		Letkrito So long have we been accustomed a friend , to think of Kiiifixiii as henceforth among the silent , so long have we been in possession of his '' Complete Works , '' that it is a delight indeed to greet a new volume from his pen '' Letters to a Friend '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The book is but a small one , the letters being few only thirty-four in all and many of them very short .

		But they have the true Emersonian ring ; almost we would recognize the authorship even if published without signature .

		Here we find the 8ame gentle optimism , the same inspiring note , as in his Essays .

		For example : '' What better sign can the good genius of our times show that the old creative force is ready to work again , than the uni - versal indisposition of the best heads to touch the books even of name and fame ? ''

		Or again : '' Con - cord is a great capital and contemporaneous with all the ages . ''

		The volume is edited with an intro - duction by Professor
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	.

		But the identity of the '' Friend '' is not disclosed , and we are told little of him except that he was nine years the junior of the philosopher , and that he was possessed of the practical qualities and the acquaint - ance with affairs in which
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	was deficient but which he held in high esteem .

		Evidently , he was one who answered
Emerson	PERSON	's own description : '' A friend is one who makes us do the best we can . ''

		For certainly , in these private letters , written for the eyes of one person only , it is always the serene , pure
Emerson	PERSON	who speaks , always the spiritual meanings of things that are looked for , always the same flow of genial polished epigram that we lis - tened for so eagerly in the days of long ago .

		No one individual possesses , or pos - sibly could possess , the consummate culture requisite to the full and com - plete appreciation of
Westminster Abbey	ORGANIZATION	.

		Only the soul of a medieval theologian could take in all the rich significance of its religious symbolism ; only a Sir

		THE DIAL 323 revival of English sculpture ; only a thorough his - torian or antiquarian could trace all the story of the massive building .

		Yet , though no one person combines in himself so numerous and so varied en - dowments , he would be stolid indeed who could walk through these aisles and transepts and chapels without quickened pulse and uplifted spirit .

		What - ever else the visitor in
England	LOCATION	may forego , it will surely not be a journey through this national Wal - halla or

Messrs. M. F. Mansfield & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, containing a sketch of the
Abbey	ORGANIZATION	by Dean
Farrar	PERSON	and a chap - ter on '' The Poet 's Corner '' by the late Dean
Stan	PERSON	- ley .

		The volume being artistically illustrated as well as attractively written , it can not fail to please as well as to inform the reader , whether his interests be of the artistic , the scientific , the historical , or the antiquarian order .

		stories of Experiences peculiar to a special the Railroad calling or industry , narrated by an and Telegraph .

		ac tual employe or operative proficient in its processes and its argot , and seasoned with the '' romance '' of the occupation treated , form the basis of a branch of '' literature '' somewhat in vogue just now .

		Rather favorable specimens of it are Mr.
John Alexander Hill	PERSON	's `` Stories of the Rail - road , '' and Mr.
Jasper Ewing Brady	PERSON	's '' Tales of the Telegraph '' -LRB-
Doubleday	ORGANIZATION	and
McClure Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Mr.
Hill	PERSON	, who has been a locomotive engineer on the
Rio Grande Railroad	ORGANIZATION	, indulges a thought too freely in the sensational and the blood-curdling , where he might more profitably have stuck to the actual and credible , and always sufficiently moving , incidents of his former calling .

		Like the '' fat boy '' in
Pickwick	LOCATION	, he '' wants to make your flesh creep '' ; and it is fair to say that he occasionally succeeds in doing it .

		But we advise him , nevertheless , to eschew melodrama and cling more closely to the actual in future .

		Mr.
Brady	PERSON	is a lively and occasionally '' slangy '' writer , who tells very amusingly the checkered story of his rambling career as a tele - graph operator .

		His concluding chapters on his experiences at
Tampa	LOCATION	during the recent war , as a
Government	ORGANIZATION	censor of telegraphic matter , are in - teresting , and we should like to see something fur - ther from Mr.
Brady	PERSON	on this theme .

		Both books are acceptably illustrated .

		A package of the recent publications of the
Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	has just been received .

		The most important of them -LRB- which we shall notice later -RRB- is a bulky monograph upon '' The
Philadelphia Negro	LOCATION	, '' by Dr.
W. E. Burghardt DuBois	PERSON	, including also '' a special report on domestic service , '' by
Miss Isabel Eaton	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the astronomical series there is a quarto pamphlet of '' Results of Observations with the
Zenith Telescope	ORGANIZATION	of the Flower Astronomical Observatory '' for two years , by Mr.
Charles L. Doolittle	PERSON	.

		A volume of '' Contribu - tions from the Botanical Laboratory '' includes several papers and a series of plates .

		In the philosophical series there is an essay '' On Spinozistic Immortality , '' by Professor
George Stuart Fullerton	PERSON	.

		Finally , in the philological series , there is an edition , by Professor
Hugo A. Rennert	PERSON	, of the comedy '' Ingratitud por Amor , '' by
Don Guillen de Castro	PERSON	. ''

		Webster 's Collegiate Dictionary '' -LRB-
Merriam	PERSON	-RRB- is a volume of more than a thousand double-columned pages , abridged , of course , from the greater '' International . ''

		It has many illustrations .

		There is one feature pecu - liar to this edition in the shape of a glossary of Scottish words and phrases designed for the guidance of '' kail - yard '' readers .

		As one authority remarks , this work is '' first class in quality and second class in size , '' which epigram may be taken for a sufficient description .

		There be few who may possess the '' Golden Legend '' of
Jacobus de Voragine	ORGANIZATION	in any of its fifteenth or six - teenth century editions , or in the sumptuous reprint of the
Kelmscott Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		But the pretty little volume of '' Leaves from the Golden Legend '' -LRB-
Dutton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- which has just been edited by Mr.
H. D. Madge	PERSON	is within the reach of the slenderest purses , and suffices to give a fair idea of one of the most popular books of the mid - dle ages .

		It is a very dainty booklet , and deserves a welcome .

		The
Whitaker & Ray Co.	ORGANIZATION	of
San Francisco	LOCATION	send us the following three pamphlets : '' The Man Who Might Have Been , '' by Mr.
Robert Whitaker	PERSON	; `` Love and Law , '' by Dr.
Thomas P. Bailey	PERSON	; and ``
California	LOCATION	and the Californians , '' by President
D. S. Jordan	PERSON	.

		Such hideous covers as enclose these publications we have seldom seen ; the contents surely deserved more con - sideration than this .

		Mr.
Paul Leicester Ford	PERSON	's edition of '' The Writings of
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	'' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is now completed with the publication of the tenth volume .

		The letters and other writings of the closing decade -LRB- 1816-1826 -RRB- of
Jefferson	LOCATION	's life are here printed , and the entire work is provided with an elaborate index .

		We congratulate Mr.
Ford	PERSON	upon this addition to his many solid contri - butions to our historical literature . ''

		The True Basis of Economics '' is a pamphlet de - fence of the theories of
Henry George	PERSON	, by Dr.
J. H. Stallard	PERSON	.

		It takes the form of a lengthy argument by Dr.
Stallard	PERSON	, with pointed comments by President
D. S. Jordan	PERSON	.

		It is hardly necessary to say that Dr.
Jordan	PERSON	gets the best of the argument , or that his small share in the book is far more weighty than the inflated decla - mation of his opponent .

		THE DIAL -LSB-

Palmer	PERSON	.

		The
Doubleday & McClure Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish a volume of '' Popular Studies in Literature , '' dealing with
Burns	PERSON	,
Scott	PERSON	, and
Byron	PERSON	.

		These studies , as edited by Mr.
Seymour Eaton	PERSON	, were originally published in a
Chicago	LOCATION	newspaper .

		The following are the latest French text-books : '' Episodes from Le Vicomte de Bragelonne '' -LRB- Long - mans -RRB- , by
Dumas	PERSON	, edited by Mr.
F. H. Hewitt	PERSON	; `` Longmans ' Illustrated First Conversational French Reader , '' by Mr.
T. H. Bertenshaw	PERSON	; `` Benjamine '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , by

Ellen A. Viuton	PERSON	, are two additional volumes in the ''
Cambridge	LOCATION	Literature Series '' of Messrs.
B. II	PERSON	.

		San - born
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons have published a new edition of `` The Art of Dining , '' by the late
Abraham Hayward	PERSON	.

		This work was first published in
1852	DATE	, and has had several reissues .

		In its present form , it has certain `` annotations and additions '' made by Mr.
Charles Sayle	PERSON	.

		There is also an excellent portrait of the author .

		Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are to be the American publishers of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's ''
Rosamund	PERSON	, Queen of the
Lombards	LOCATION	, '' and this interesting announcement is supplemented by the still more interesting one that the same publishers are preparing `` a new edition of Swin - burne 's complete poems , revised and rearranged by the author . ''

		This news is almost too good to be true .

		On the twenty-fifth of
October	DATE	came the not unex - pected news of the death of
Grant Allen	ORGANIZATION	.

		Born a Canadian , in
1848	DATE	, his education was completed in
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- rope , and , after taking an Oxford degree , he turned to teaching .

		An educational post in
Jamaica	LOCATION	held him for some years , after which he returned to
England	LOCATION	.

		He soon turned his attention to writing , his first book being the '' Physiological - ^ Esthetics '' of
1877	DATE	.

		Other serious works were '' The Color Sense , '' ''
Charles Darwin	PERSON	, '' and '' Anglo-Saxon
Britain	LOCATION	. ''

		A series of books made up of studies in popular science won for him a large circle of readers .

		About twelve years ago he turned to fiction , and produced a series of novels which were pot-boilers unabashed but proved highly successful as producers of an income . ''

		The Tents of Shem '' and '' The Woman Who Did '' are among the best known of these pro- ductions .

		The retirement of Mr.
E. L. Godkin	PERSON	from the active editorial control of the
New York	LOCATION	'' Evening Post '' and '' Nation '' has just been announced , and is a matter of deep concern to all intelligent Americans .

		As the guid - ing spirit , first of the weekly paper and afterwards of the daily as well , Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	has been one of the strongest forces in our public life , and , what is more important , a force almost invariably exercised in beh : ilf of the highest ideals of intelligence and morality .

		Not long ago , one of the English reviews spoke of his activ - ity and influence as comparable with that so long exer - cised in
England	LOCATION	by
John Stuart Mill	PERSON	; and the coinp ; ir - ison is a just one .

		Whenever a great cause has needed a defender in this country , from the early days of the Reconstruction period to these later days which so om - inously threaten a departure from the political principles that have made our country great , such a defender has been found in the person of Mr. -LRB- iodkin , and his voice has been uplifted with no uncertain sound in behalf of truth and justice , no matter how unwelcome to the pop - ulace such utterances might be .

		Few men have done our country such true and loyal service as this adopted citi - zen of the Republic , and we trust that his retirement from the editorial desk will not mean the end of his active influence as a moulder of enlightened pnblie opinion .

		PUBLIC OPINION II ASTOR PLACE ,
NEW YORK	LOCATION	CITY .

		The Old Masters Notwithstanding the fact that they are glibly discussed , are nevertheless almost entire strangers to the novices in art as well as to the general public .

		The reason for this is , that aside from the more or less slight sketches in encyclopaedias and in the so-called art '' handbooks , '' the lives of the masters have been comprehensively dealt with only in expensive treatises , and are accessible , therefore , only to a narrow cir - cle of readers , and to those mainly in public libraries .

		It was with a view of reaching the many cultivated readers and stu - dents of art who can not afford to possess these more expensive treatises , but who nevertheless desire a closer acquaintance with , and knowledge of , the great masters that Professor
H. KNACKFUSS	PERSON	was induced to undertake the series of | MONOGRAPHS ON ARTISTS in which the great periods of art , and the lives of those who took leading parts in developing art in all its phases , are treated with scientific thoroughness in a manner which makes it comprehensible to all .

		In this endeavor Professor KNACKFUSS has been ably seconded by the publisher , who has spared no expense in giving the text a dignified and artis - tic dress , and adding to it everything in the way of illustration that could amplify the author 's meaning , as well as to convey to the reader , by means of excellent reproductive processes , a vivid idea of the masters ' greatest works .

		And all this at a price which places this series within the reach of those with the most limited means .

		Thus far the subjects treated are RAPHAEL .

		.

		HOLBEIN .

		.

		REMBRANDT VAN DYCK .

		Translated into English by
CAMPBELL DODGSON	PERSON	.

		Each volume , artistically bound , 8vo ...
$ 1.50	MONEY	Other volumes are in preparation .

		This series may safely be recom - mended to the artist , the student , and the lover of art , the teacher and the general public as text-books or as holiday gifts .

		The first part of this work under the title of '' A
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	Experiment in Government , '' was published in the
Spring of 1898	DATE	, and met a warm reception from press and public , and a ready sale .

		It carried the narrative from the founding of the
Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	down to the year

		The present volume traces the same conflict through the stormy events of the Revolution , and examines its momentous results .

		SYMBOLS AND EMBLEMS-ILLUSTRATED .

		BY
H. J. SMITH	PERSON	.

		An indispensable book for all architects , designers , and draughtsmen , and for workmen in the artistic , deco - rative , and high-class building trades .

		The author , an eminent designer in stained glass , has been impressed with the fact that in art education of our day the subject of Symbolism seems to have been overlooked .

		`` Very little direct instruction upon it seems to be given in the art schools , and graduates are left to learn at haphazard or to guess at the meaning of the symbols that are used so lavishly in our churches . ''

		The reason for this general neglect is to be found in the fact that the many works on the subject were written by and for the theologian and the arcbseologist , and are too abstruse to be used as works of popular reference .

		This is both a popular and a comprehensive manual of the subject .

		It is made as plain and concise as possible , and is thus enabled to illustrate and explain with all necessary fulness over three hundred and fifty symbols , including all the most familiar forms a far greater number than is contained in any other work .

		Illustrations are arranged in one hundred magnificent full-page quarto plates , each plate being accompanied by one or more pages of explanatory letter-press .

		Royal quarto , printed on extra heavy deckle-edged paper , bound in illuminated art vellum ,
$ 5 00	MONEY	.

		372 A MEMORY FOREVER .

		A recent contributor to our English contem - porary , '' The Academy , '' has been sharpening his wits to a rather fine point in protesting against the introduction of school children , at too early an age , to the masterpieces of English poetry .

		His special text is found in Gray 's '' Elegy , '' and his childish recollections of that poem are decidedly diverting . ''

		I remember how I used to grind through it without one word of explanation when I was a little fellow of ten years of age -LSB- observe , ten ! -RSB-

		: each line went by itself , and one consequence was that the thing in the piece that impressed me most was the reference to ` The dark , nnfathomed caves of ocean bear . '

		I had had my neck nearly wrung off in those days for once saying that a noun ' governed ' something , and I was not the boy to risk further twisting by asking if it was the polar bear that was meant ; but there was a magnificent remoteness in the dwelling of this creature that always pleased me , and it was not till later that I discovered what the verse really meant . ''

		Continuing , in similar strain , he asks : '' What boy ever believed in the ' hoary-headed swain ' or the ' forefathers of the hamlet ' ?

		As for the youth who gave to Misery all he had , a tear , and gained from Heaven , 't was all he wish 'd , a friend , no schoolboy ever understood that transaction .

		And this poem , which boys can not understand , and masters can not hope to explain , is our accepted introduction to poetry . ''

		A like protest has been made , time and time again , against the rigid drill in Homer and
Virgil	PERSON	which schoolmasters have deemed the necessary foundation of a sound classical edu - cation .

		These names become in recollection the symbols of a disagreeable experience , and whatever natural proclivities a youth may have for the enjoyment of poetry become stifled by such a premature attempt to force his taste .

		The result is that , from the time of his emanci - pation from this compulsory application of the classics , he shuns them ever afterwards , and , as one humorist has put it , acquires as the fruits of his training in Greek and Latin little more than the firm conviction that two such languages exist .

		There is , no doubt , a certain force in protests of this sort , and injudicious methods in the education of young people have done much to justify the complaint ; but there is another side to the question , a side which is , on the whole , 350 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, the stronger of the two , and which there is a growing tendency among educators to ignore .

		The great variety of new educational devices which are nowadays urged upon the bewildered young teacher are too apt to have this in com - mon , that they involve a relaxation of discipline for tli - student , and take from him the sense of responsibility for his own performance .

		If a problem seems too hard , there is always some one at hand to relieve him of the effort neces - sary to master it , and he is encouraged to seek such relief before he has half exhausted his own resources .

		Already many voices are raised among wisely conservative educators of long experience , warning the public of the conse - quences of this drift of our methods of instruc - tion .

		By dint of this smoothing over of all difficulties we are not developing the intel - lectual stamina that was a product of the severer methods of the past ; and , however glibly we may talk about the encouragement of self-activity , we are really playing with it , instead of setting it in the forefront of our endeavors .

		Recurring to the special subject of literature , there is a good deal to be said for the old - fashioned plan of anticipating the tastes that later years may be expected to develope .

		This does not necessarily mean that the mental maw of a child of ten should be crammed with poems like the '' Elegy , '' but it does mean , first , that nothing but very good literature should be given to school children , and , second , that it may safely be literature considerably in advance of their complete comprehension .

		The notion that it must all be explained and digested then and there is fatal to the growth of appreciation .

		Give a child something that appeals to him in part , and the sense of mystery which invests the rest of the work brings the best possible stimulus to his growth in the right direction .

		And then there is the faculty of memory to be considered .

		The disrepute into which cultiva - tion of the memory has fallen is one of the most alarming features of recent theorizing , and no educational word is to-day more needed than a strong reinsertion of the claims of this faculty upon the attention of the teacher .

		The right kind of student , struggling with the construction and the scansion of his
Milton	PERSON	or his
Virgil	PERSON	, and receiving only a dim sort of illumination upon his path , is all the while enriching his memory unawares with cadenced phrases that will reecho in his consciousness through the years to come , and give him spiritual sustenance in a future that would be harsh indeed without their soften - ing ministry .

		We say the right kind of stu - dent the other kind , whose occasional ex - istence must be admitted , had better give up the pursuit of literary culture when it becomes certain that the portals of that paradise are not to be opened for him , and take to chemistry , or civil engineering , or political economy .

		But because there are in every generation some such men and women , subject to limitations that permanently exclude them from sharing in the highest hopes and aspirations of humanity , although capable of a life of honest activity upon some lower intellectual plane , let us take good heed not to add to their numbers through neglect of the agencies provided for our hand in the early years of training .

		It is better at the start to set the highest aim for all , abandon - ing it only in those cases whose development clearly proves it unattainable , than to set a lower aim merely because we may hope for its realization by a larger number of souls .

		`` Not failure , bat low aim , is crime . ''

		In the matter of education , no less than of the subjective ideal , these words of
Lowell	LOCATION	are eternally true .

		A thing of beauty is a joy forever , because , when it has once entered fully into the con - sciousness , it becomes a memory forever .

		We must not expect this penetrating process to be accomplished all at once .

		Of course , no child will half understand the beauty of a great poem or a fine example of imaginative prose .

		Let it but kindle his thought at a single point , and awaken his interest in partial degree only ; the slow and semi-conscious development of his intellect may be trusted to carry on the work of assimilation to its completion .

		How many a writer has borne testimony to this fructifying influence of noble literature in the mind of childhood .

		The following passage from Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	's `` Fors '' has been quoted more than once , but we must quote it again , because it tells the whole story : ' My mother forced me , by steady daily toil , to learn long chapters of the Bible by heart ; as well as to read it every syllable through , aloud , hard names and all , from Genesis to the Apocalypse , about once a year ; and to that discipline patient , accurate , and resolute I owe , not only a knowledge of the book , which I find oc - casionally serviceable , but much of my general power of taking pains , and the best part of my taste in liter - ature . ''

		Our modern education is at fault if it does not find place for some such discipline as this during those precious early years so soon at an end when the fresh receptivity of the mind is not dulled , and the memory cheerfully re -

		THE DIAL 351 spends to the stimulus of serious reading .

		Most men in middle life find that they preserve a more vivid recollection of their reading of twenty or thirty years ago than of the reading done by them at a very recent date .

		There is perhaps no other of the great poets of the world quite equal to
Virgil	PERSON	in the pos - session of the quality whereby the phrases imperfectly apprehended by childhood become an ever richer possession as time rolls by .

		For two thousand years the mintage of his thought has had this magical power to associate itself with the tenderest memories and the inmost sympathies of men .

		We all know
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's exquisite reference to the '' Virgilian cry , The sense of tears in mortal things . ''

		We all know , too , the series of instances so effectively marshalled by Mr.
Frederic Myers	PERSON	in that essay on Virgil which is '' classical '' in more senses than one .

		Less familiar , however , are the two passages adduced in support of this claim by a recent correspondent of '' The Na - tion , '' passages which reveal the minds of
Rob	PERSON	- ert
Louis Stevenson	PERSON	and
John Henry Newman	PERSON	, so dissimilar in most respects , for once work - ing in complete harmony .

		This is what we find in `` The Ebb - Tide '' : '' The
Virgil	PERSON	, which he could not exchange against a meal , had often consoled him in his hunger .

		He would study it , ... seeking favorite passages , and find - ing new ones only less beautiful because they lacked the consecration and remembrance .

		Or he would pause on random country walks , sit on the pathside , gazing over the sea on the mountains of
Eimeo	LOCATION	, and dip into the ' ^ Eneid , ' seeking sortes .

		And if the oracle -LRB- as is the way of oracles -RRB- replied with no very certain or encour - aging voice , visions of
England	LOCATION	, at least , would throng upon the exile 's memory the busy school - room , the green playing-fields , holidays at home , and the peren - nial roar of
London	LOCATION	, and the fireside , and the white head of his father .

		For it is the destiny of these grave , restrained , and classic writers , with whom we make en - forced and often painful acquaintance at school , to pass into the blood and become native in the memory ; so that a phrase of
Virgil	PERSON	speaks not so much of
Mantua	LOCATION	or
Augustus	PERSON	, but of English places and the student 's own irrevocable youth . ''

		The other excerpt is from the '' Grammar of Assent , '' and links with the name of Virgil the suggestion of Homer and Horace : '' Passages which to a boy are but rhetorical com - monplaces , neither better nor worse than a hundred others which any clever writer might supply , which he gets by heart and thinks very fine , and imitates , as he thinks , successfully in his own flowing versification , at length come home to him when long years have passed and he has had experience of life , and pierce him as if he had never before known them , with their said earn - estness and vivid exactness .

		Then he comes to under - stand how it is that lines , the birth of some chance morning or evening at an Ionian festival , or among the Sabine hills , have lasted generation after generation for thousands of years , with a power over the mind , and a charm , which the current literature of his own day , with all its obvious advantages , is utterly unable to rival .

		Perhaps this is the reason of the mediaeval opinion about
Virgil	PERSON	, as if a prophet or magician ; his single words and phrases , his pathetic half - lines , giving utter - ance , as the voice of Nature herself , to that pain and weariness , yet hope of better things , which is the ex - perience of her children in every time . ''

		The seeming drudgery of the old-fashioned type of education was well worth the while if it resulted in such memory-deposits as these , and it becomes little less than a crime to waste the opportunity , which early youth alone offers , of fertilizing the mind with the pollen that may , if all goes well , yield such a harvest in the later years .

		THE `` PASSING '' OF MATTHEW ARNOLD .

		It is no doubt an advantage of the philosophy of evolution , so popular in its manifold application to-day , that it tends to clear the ground of a hamper - ing accumulation of methods and results from the past , and give a freer hand to the workers of the present .

		But the true evolutionist recognizes the permanent elements which pass on from stage to stage of development , no less than the vanishing characteristics of the single stage .

		The ambitious builder of the present day , then , must be careful in preparing his site that he does not waste energy and time in removing solid rock .

		Some ten years ago , a band of self-appointed defenders of
America	LOCATION	and its institutions undertook to drive
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	out of court with clubs and tomahawks .

		He was a snob , an aristocrat , and an ignoramus , knowing nothing of American insti - tutions and not much of anything else , without the ability even to use the English language correctly , on the hypothesis that he had anything to say .

		But such attacks really did more good than harm , since they convinced the judicious that the critic 's verdict , `` Thou ailest here , and here , '' was timely and well - grounded ; and an increasing number of Americans went on reading Mr.
Arnold	PERSON	's works with profit and enjoyment .

		When his `` Letters '' were given to eagerly waiting readers , a few years ago , the editor deemed it expedient in his prefatory remarks po - litely to dismiss from consideration no small share of
Arnold	LOCATION	's life 's work : '' His theology , once the subject of some just criticism , seems now a matter of comparatively little moment . ''

		But
Arnold	PERSON	minus his distinctively theological writings is still an author of considerable proportions and possible permanent importance ; and so many of us have gone on studying him with pleasure and supposed benefit , not even denying ourselves a sly dip into 852 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, his theological essays when the back of his literary executor was turned .

		Bat now comes a critic who seems at first view to cut the ground entirely from under our feet .

		With the sweeping thoroughness of the Roman Emperor who would have had the necks of his sub - jects all united in one , that a single blow of the sword might finish the business , the author of '' Social Ideals in English Letters '' ranges
Arnold	LOCATION	's entire work under the social motive and calmly as - signs it to a shelf in the Museum of Historical Sociology : '' Already we look back to
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's strong and vivid work as belonging rather to his - tory than to the things that are . ''

		There is an air of the inevitable about these words that makes one hesitate to challenge them , for fear he may accomplish nothing but to demonstrate his own fitness for a place in the museum ; but even at that risk we are not willing to give up
Arnold	LOCATION	with - out a struggle .

		Using the word '' social '' in the broad sense in - tended throughout Miss
Scudder	ORGANIZATION	's book , one finds no difficulty in agreeing with her that
Arnold	PERSON	's aim `` was everywhere social . ''

		It is only when she comes down to details of interpretation , that there is reasonable ground for difference .

		And the writer , for one , feels strongly that there is such ground at the very point wherein seems to lie the motive for the verdict which has been quoted .

		Miss
Scudder	ORGANIZATION	writes not as the indifferent historian , seeking only to set before the reader the dry facts as to the social ideals of English men of letters , with no opin - ions of her own to maintain : she is the open cham - pion of the movement to better the social condition of the masses , and naturally anxious that substantial results shall not be too long delayed .

		Now , writ - ing from this point of view , and , we believe , not keeping vividly in mind certain features of
Arnold	LOCATION	's method , she has come to the unnecessary conclusion that further social progress is possible only when he is left behind .

		After summing up the character - istics of the Greek temperament which he thought it necessary to inculcate in order to the development of a symmetrical English character , she adds : '' And meanwhile we must wholly abstain from ac - tion . ''

		Now , if
Arnold	LOCATION	had held theoretically that total abstention from action was necessary until the process of tempering British Hebraism with a suitable admixture of Hellenism should be fairly accomplished , the prospect for results under such a method would indeed be discouraging .

		Nor could he be defended against the charge of glaring inconsistency , since he did not wholly abstain from action himself , nor did he fail to find due occasion for encouraging others to action , both individual and legislative .

		But one is not driven to the neces - sity of interpreting his published words by his indi - vidual course as a citizen and member of society .

		A careful reading of his essays amply warrants the statement that he did not contemplate absolute ab - stention from action even as a temporary expedient .

		What he deprecated was ill-advised action , based on an incomplete and misleading conception of cir - cumstances and relations .

		No doubt he would have included under this head a very large proportion of the philanthropic action , individual and organized , of his time , too large a proportion , if you will .

		But such a mere mistaking of degree , if mistake there was , does not bring him into conflict with progress , and is of little importance .

		It certainly bore a less ratio to his quantum of correct judgment than the mistakes of the average British or American social reformer and philanthropist to his instances of wise action .

		With penetrating insight , he was painfully aware that an immense amount of earnest and well - intended effort was at best missing its aim , and in many cases doing positive harm , because of the lack of a free play of ideas '' upon the subject in ques - tion .

		Such a free play of ideas he considered it his mission to promote .

		And we may say that his aim was everywhere this , as well as to say that it was everywhere social .

		But when we approach it from this side it is easy to see that his work does not necessarily pass from the domain of living impor - tance with the age that produced it .

		The habit of ill-considered action , growing out of the failure to bring a free play of ideas to bear , is as old as human history and bids fair to remain among us for many generations yet to come .

		And while it does remain , there will always be occasion for effort to deprecate over-hasty action , and to stimulate thought , in all lines of social progress .

		Hebraism in its own home produced a literature of conduct which the world has never yet passed by , and never will pass by until some other nation puts a better in its place .

		Hellenism likewise bore fruit for which the world is sure to have use until it is surpassed in its own kind .

		Arnold saw that the highest type of human development must effect a fitting synthesis of the two -LRB- not of course excluding the possibility of the development of still other traits , which neither He - brews nor Hellenes brought into prominence -RRB- , and he gave to English letters an extended series of brilliant essays in that direction .

		He did not think to revolutionize society at once , though he was no pessimist , as many who have not read him , and are hardly prepared to understand him if they should , would have us believe .

		But he would have been very much surprised to be told by one so sympa - thetic as Miss
Scudder	ORGANIZATION	that his work would belong to history , rather than to the things that are , as soon as a portion of his '' remnant '' should have assumed for a few years an attitude of deep thought and scrupulous inaction .

		What he wanted was to set up a process of `` osmosis '' of the best traits of
Hebra	LOCATION	- ism and Hellenism through the separating mem - brane of British prejudice and indifference , and by this means he trusted to accelerate the rise from the culture-level of the majority to that of the rem - nant No one would have been less pleased than he to be told that his work was on a level with that of the Greeks and Hebrews , for he would readily have
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 353 recognized such a statement as clumsy and insin - cere flattery ; but he was a good judge of effective English expression , and he doubtless expected his books to live and carry on his mission until super - seded by another who should say substantially the same things in a manner still more attractive and effective .

		That has not yet been done , and perhaps one will not give unpardonable offense to the literary guild of the present day by suggesting that there is no immediate prospect of its being done .

		And yet no thoughtful friend of Arnold need feel any satis - faction that this is so , for he himself was so single - minded in pursuit of his end that he would have hailed gladly an eclipse of that sort .

		As regards Mr.
Russell	PERSON	's apology for
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's theological writings , we can hardly see that even this was necessary or advisable .

		In this field Ar - nold was working , not for positive results in the way of a detailed theological platform , but for an honest and discriminating method .

		A continually growing number are willing to admit within certain limits the existence of the `` unbridled license of affirmation '' in religious matters which he attacked with such vigor .

		He has made a great many read - ers realize that vivid hope and faith are not identi - cal with scientific demonstration , and that harm is sure to come from failure to realize the distinction either in thought or in language .

		One who reads him with care can see that he has no quarrel with those who can base upon the data at hand a more comprehensive belief than his .

		He is to be read , then , not for detailed information as to what one should believe and what reject in religious matters , but to place the curb of intelligent discrimination upon one 's belief , and especially to check the habit of demanding of them that are weak in the faith tests that are not fundamentally necessary and are sure to repel .

		He held to his ideal of the free play of thought in the realm of religion as tenaciously as anywhere else .

		As some of our older bards have gradually fallen into the position of `` poets of the poets , '' so
Arnold	LOCATION	, if we mistake not , will become more and more the reformer of reformers .

		With the earnest desire for the good of his fellow-men which is char - acteristic of all sincere reformers , he had also the mental poise , the control of the emotions , and the logical temper , which the reform spirit is too apt to lack .

		And the multiplied cases of well-intended effort that failed because of that lack must gradu - ally drive intelligent philanthropic endeavor toward the path which he has pointed out .

		One can hardly conceive of his writings becoming popular in the usual sense of that term .

		The scores of thousands of working-men who have devoured the pages of '' Looking Backward '' during the past decade , as if it were a divine revelation , will live and die with no knowledge of
Arnold	LOCATION	; but here and there there will be one of a thousand among them , with keener power of discernment , who will loosen with disgust his hold upon the air-castles of
Bellamy	PERSON	and drop to the solid ground of the apostle of culture ; not , of course , the mawkish product which the enemies of Arnold have persistently attributed to him under that name , but the culture of which all classes may partake at the price of using such opportunities for self-improvement as are open to their efforts .

		And the philanthropist who can persuade men of thought to give Arnold a careful reading will do much more to put the ground in condition for a fruitful harvest than he who begins with an attempt to get
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	himself out of the way .

		THE UNEDUCATED COLLEGE MAN .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The Inaugural of Dr.
George Harris	PERSON	,
Amherst	LOCATION	's newly inducted President , was , as some of your readers doubtless know , an unusually thoughtful and suggestive address on the theme , '' The Man of Letters in De - mocracy . ''

		By '' man of letters '' Dr.
Harris	PERSON	meant , as he explained , not the professional literary man , but '' the man that is liberally educated , the cultivated man , for practical purposes the college man '' ; and he then went on to add to his definition the following remark - able qualification : `` Although ... there are college men that are uneducated . ''

		Now this admission , coming from such a source , and partially justifying as it does the common popular sneer at the '' college graduate , '' seems to the present writer a much more serious and significant one than the rather airy and casual way in which it is made might lead one to suppose .

		Is it then true that our higher educational institutions are in the habit of graduating a proportion of `` uneducated '' young men starting them out in life , as it were , on a basis of intellectual false pretences , and equipped with a virtually fraudulent certificate of scholarly attainments in the shape of an unearned diploma ?

		And if this be the case , what is the degree of moral difference between such conduct on the part of a higher educational institution , and essentially similar conduct on the part , say , of the '' bogus '' medical col - lege which , in consideration of so many dollars , grants its lying '' sheepskin '' to anyone who chooses to apply for it ?

		The question is a nice one for the casuist .

		It really seems that there ought to be at least one college or university in this country whose diploma could be safely accepted as a positive guarantee against the illiteracy of its possessor .

		Is there such a one ?

		and , if not , to what radical defect of aim or system is the scandal due ?

		That it is not due to a lack of funds or equipment , is manifest ; and it is needless to say that our college professors in general form a body of which we are justly proud , and to which we look with a con - fidence seldom misplaced for light and leading .

		Why is it , then , that the '' uneducated '' college man is not only not a rara avis in
America	LOCATION	, but a bird so common and so familiar that President
Harris	PERSON	in a public address serenely takes it for granted that everybody knows him , and that nobody would think of questioning his exist - ence ?

		Is '' commercialism '' in any way answerable for him ?

		We are accustomed just now , perhaps reason - ably enough , to charge a good many of our evils to this score ; and if it be true -LRB- as some aver -RRB- that there is a tendency to '' commercialize '' our colleges , to subordi - 354 THE DIAL -LSB-

		GREEK WITH TEARS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		On my table lies the latest '' First Greek Book , '' a good one of its type , scholarly , largely original , even interesting in many parts .

		My only cavil as to most of it would be , that plenty of entire chapters in
Xenophon	LOCATION	's immortal romance are easier , and still more interesting .

		But the luckless schoolboy , in his first lesson , is referred to nineteen different chapters of another volume a scientific grammar which he should not see for many months .

		From that grammar he must first learn two alphabets , complicated laws for the uses of three accents , paradigms , etc. '' Latciale ogni iperanza '' is written a hundred times , in no dim colors , over the first gate .

		Kindly allow a long-suffering schoolmaster to say that the chief difficulties of Greek are created by our textbook-makers , by massing at the beginning most of the novel elements , and by omitting everything which should make these elements fasciuating and instructive .

		It is the first maxim of pedagogy , and of persuasion generally , to connect what is new with what is already known and accepted .

		Now , every Yankee schoolboy has used one Hellenic alphabet ted years or more before he is set to learn the louic .

		The interrelation of the two is easily told , and sheds a flood of light on some old puzzles .

		Why not start your Greek primer with that ?

		There is only one serious mystery in the long tale , and that can be stated picturesquely ,
viz.	LOCATION	, that the group of alphabets which included the Ionian used the cross with the value fc-f-A , so that , to the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	world , it became , and still is ,
Christ	ORGANIZATION	's initial as well as his emblem ; while
Chalkis	PERSON	, and therefore Cumw ,
Rome	LOCATION	,
London	LOCATION	,
Seattle	LOCATION	, gave X another value .

		A half-hour chalk-talk , or even a brief chapter of a primer , might make the '' new '' Greek alphabet seem an alluring introduction .

		That the `` small letters , '' Greek or English , are merely the natural modification of the '' capitals , '' when a pen takes the chisel 's place , can be graphically shown .

		We claim to teach Attic fifth or fourth century Greek .

		Why should not our boy see his first sentence as
Aloi	PERSON	- biades did his ?

		For example , OIIATEP4EPE MOIATOAEON TAZBXAZLAZ Then when the words here chosen of course , be - cause any decent Latinist can guess their meaning are transliterated , our youth may realize that accents , etc. , were indeed benevolent inventions for the guidance of foreigners .

		And why three accents ?

		There was but one ,
viz.	LOCATION	, the rise in tone on one syllable of a word .

		Why not feed the child in the first days wholly on paroxytone o-stems , and '' regular '' verbs , until the habit of accenting at all is acquired ?

		Then , the accent miscalled and ill-written as '' grave '' is but a reminder that a final acute could not reach its full height if no pause followed .

		The -LRB- rela - tively rare -RRB- circumflex merely shows that the return to the normal tone was made within the same syllable .

		These things are true .

		They are simpler , more inter - esting , hence easier remembered , than the current '' laws . ''

		Why is the truth too good for the beginner ?

		Comparative philology should be invoked when she really simplifies or illuminates with the light of un - doubted truth .

		xV ' should be declined beside hor - tut because it will convince last year 's doubting Thom - ases that even Latin o-stems really were stems in o , and it also shows the greater perfection of the Greek forms .

		It is a good idea to postpone the a-stems , but not to call them difficult .

		The phenomenon of '' breaking , '' or change of a to ij , is chiefly obscured by the fact that it occurs so largely in our own vernacular : so largely , indeed , that the English name itself for A has '' broken '' to that given everywhere else in
Europe	LOCATION	to K .

		The relation of Attic < MA `` j to Latin fama is best illustrated by bidding the pupil write , in Greek letters , the English word/ami -LRB- i. e. , < / > ^ M -RRB- .

		Would such material make a primer of Greek begin like a volume of brief readable essays ?

		Perhaps so .

		If to write connectedly , interestingly , throwing fresh light on familiar knowledge and weaving in new facts so that they can not be forgotten , is to be unscholarly , then our manuals are impeccable .

		THE HUGO MEMOIRS .

		* In so far as there is very little of what may in strictness be termed autobiography in the Memoirs of
Victor Hugo	PERSON	, the work is likely to prove disappointing to not a few readers .

		These will have naturally looked for something in the shape of a continuous narrative of a picturesque and checkered career a retro - spect and final summing up of an illustrious life .

		What they will find is a medley of cau - series , literary remnants , aperqus , stories in the style of
Captain Gronow	LOCATION	, memories of the stage , of the Academy , of the
Chamber	ORGANIZATION	, of the Court of
Louis Philippe	PERSON	, of Napoleon '' the Little , '' of the events of
' 48	DATE	, of the Siege of
Paris	LOCATION	.

		In fine , the Memoir is fragmentary , it is miscellaneous , it bubbles with sentiment and corruscates with Hugoesque turns of thought and diction , it is eminently readable , but it is not autobiography .

		As the editor ,
M. Paul Meurice	PERSON	, conscientiously describes it , '' it is a sort of haphazard chronique ... a series of pictures of infinite variety . ''

		In externals , this rather stout volume of 400 odd pages is fairly presentable ; but in point of typography and proof-reading it is not , it must in candor be said , irreproachable .

		There is a tolerable front - ispiece portrait of the author , but no index an unpardonable omission in an important work bristling with proper names and altogether likely to be marked by the reader as one valu - able for reference in the future .

		This '' haphazard chronique '' of Victor
Hugo	PERSON	's begins with the year 1825 , with some memories of the coronation of
Charles X.	PERSON	at Kheims '' Rheims the land of chimeras , which is perhaps the reason that kings are crowned there . '' ''

		A coronation was a godsend to

		It was during this visit to Kheims that Hugo first read a play of Shakespeare , ''

Charles Nodier	PERSON	.

		Nodier and I remained alone and pensive , thinking of the great works that are unappreciated , and amazed that the intellectual education of the civilized peoples , and even our own , his and mine , had advanced no further than this . ''

		Some interesting details of the execution of
Louis XVI	PERSON	.

		were gathered by Hugo in
1840	DATE	from an eye-witness of the tragedy . ''

		The executioners numbered four ; two only per - formed the execution ; the third stayed at the foot of the ladder , and the fourth was on the waggon which was to convey the
King	ORGANIZATION	's body to the Madeleine Ceme - tery ... Two priests , commissaries of the Commune , sat in the Mayor 's carriage laughing and conversing in loud tones .

		One of them ,
Jacques Roux	PERSON	, derisively drew the other 's attention to
Capet	LOCATION	's fat calves and ab - domen ... The guillotine would appear to the crafts - men of to-day to be very badly constructed .

		The knife was simply suspended from a pulley fixed in the centre of the upper beam .

		This pulley and a rope the thick - ness of a man 's thumb constituted the whole apparatus .

		The knife , which was not very heavily weighted , was of small dimensions , and had a curved edge which gave it the form of a reversed Phrygian cap .

		... At the mo - ment when the head of Louis XVI .

		fell , the Abbe *
Edgeworth	PERSON	was still near the
King	LOCATION	.

		The blood spirted upon him .

		He hastily donned a brown overcoat , de - scended from the scaffold and was lost in the crowd . ''

		Among his many interesting conversations with
Louis Philippe	PERSON	,
Victor Hugo	PERSON	records one in which the
King	ORGANIZATION	spoke of meeting Petion and
Robespierre	LOCATION	at a dinner given by a wealthy manufacturer of
Louviers	LOCATION	, a M. Decreteau . ''

		Mirabeau -LRB- said the King -RRB- aptly traced
Robespierre	LOCATION	's portrait in a word when he said that his face was sug - gestive of that of ' a cat drinking vinegar . '

		He was very gloomy and hardly spoke .

		When he did let drop a word from time to time , it was uttered sourly and 356 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, with reluctance .

		He seemed to be vexed at having come , and because I was there .

		In the middle of the dinner ,
Prftion	LOCATION	, addressing
M. Decrdteau	PERSON	, exclaimed : ' My dear host , you must get this buck married I ' He pointed to
Robespierre	LOCATION	. '

		What do you mean , Pe * tion ? '

		retorted
Robespierre	LOCATION	.

		` Mean , ' said Pe * tion , why that you must get married .

		I insist upon marrying yon .

		You are full of sourness , hypochondria , gall , bad humor , biliousness , and atrabiliousness .

		I am fearful of all this on our account .

		What you want is a woman to sweeten this sourness and transform you into an easy-going old fogey . '

		Robespierre tossed his head and tried to smile , but only succeeded in making a grimace .

		It was the only time that I met
Robespierre	LOCATION	in society .

		After that I saw him in the tribune of the Convention .

		He was wearisome to a supreme degree , spoke slowly , heavily , and at length , and was more sour , more gloomy , more bitter than ever .

		It was easy to see that Pe * tion had not married him . ''


Louis Philippe	PERSON	's reflections on his English experiences , as reported by
Victor Hugo	PERSON	, are interesting . ''

		Have you seen the English Parliament ?

		You speak from your place , standing , in the midst of your own party ; you are carried away ; you say more often than not what others think instead of what you think your - self .

		There is a magnetic communication .

		You are subjected to it .

		You rise -LRB- here the
King	ORGANIZATION	rose and imi - tated the gesture of an orator speaking in
Parliament	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		The assembly ferments all round and close to you ; you let yourself go .

		On this side somebody says ,
' England	LOCATION	has suffered a gross insult ' ; and on that side , ` with gross indignity . '

		It is simply applause that is sought on both sides .

		Nothing more .

		But this is bad .

		In
France	LOCATION	our tribune which isolates the orator has many advantages .

		Of all the English statesmen , I have known only one who was able to withstand this influence of assemblies .

		He was
M. Pitt	PERSON	.


M. Pitt	PERSON	was a clever man , although he was very tall .

		He had an air of awk - wardness and spoke hesitatingly .

		His lower jaw weighed a hundredweight ...
England	LOCATION	resembles
France	LOCATION	in nothing .

		Over there are order , arrangement , symmetry , cleanliness , well-mown lawns , and profound silence in the streets .

		The passers-by are as serious and as mute as spectres .

		When , being French and alive , you speak in the street , these spectres look back at you and murmur with an inexpressible mixture of gravity and disdain , ' French people ! ' ''

		A curious anecdote is told of a visit of
Louis Philippe	LOCATION	to
Dreux	LOCATION	, to put in order the bones in the
Orleans	LOCATION	family sepulchre which had been violated during the Revolution . ''

		The King had the coffin brought and opened before him .

		He was alone with the chaplain and two aides - de-camp .

		Another coffin , larger and stronger , bad been prepared .

		The King himself , with his own hands , took , one after another , the bones of his ancestors from the broken coffin and arranged them in the new one .

		He would not permit anyone else to touch them .

		From time to time he counted the skulls and said : ` This is Monsieur the
Duke de Penthievre	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is
Monsieur the Count de Beaujolais	ORGANIZATION	. '

		Then to the best of his abil - ity he completed each group of bones .

		This ceremony lasted from nine o'clock in the morning until seven o'clock in the evening without the King taking either rest or nourishment . ''

		Let us turn to
M. Hugo	PERSON	's memories of Academicians .

		Here is a pretty story at the expense of Salvandy : '' Salvandy recently dined with
Villemain	PERSON	.

		The re - past over , they adjourned to the drawing-room , and conversed .

		As the clock struck eight ,
Villemain	PERSON	's three little daughters entered to kiss their father good night .

		The youngest is named Lucette ; she is a sweet and charming child of five years . '

		Well ,
Lucette	LOCATION	, dear child , ' said her father , ' wo n't you recite one of
Lafon	PERSON	- taine 's fables before you go to bed ? ' '

		Here , ' observed
M. de Salvandy	PERSON	, ` is a little person who to-day recites fables and who one of these days will inspire romances . '

		Lucette did not understand .

		She merely gazed with big , wondering eyes at
Salvandy	LOCATION	, who was lolling in his chair with an air of benevolent condescension . '

		Well ,
Lucette	LOCATION	, ' he went on , ' will you not recite a fable for us ? '

		The child required no urging , and began in her naive little voice , her fine , frank eyes still fixed upon Salvandy : One easily believes one 's self to be somebody in
France	LOCATION	: '' Under the date
April 22 , 1847	DATE	, we find re - corded in M. Hugo 's notes the election to the Academy of M. Ampere : '' This is an improvement upon the last .

		A slow im - provement .

		But Academies , like old people , go slowly .

		During the session and after the election , Latnartitie sent me by an usher the following lines : ` C `` esf tin ttat peu protpfre D'aller d'Empit en Ampere . '

		I replied to him by the same usher : ' Toutffois ce strait pis
Waller	PERSON	d 1 Ampere en Empis . ' ''

		In his series of '' Sketches made in the Na - tional Assembly , '' Victor Hugo draws a not too flattering portrait of Thiers . ''


M. Thiers	PERSON	wants to treat men , ideas , and revolution - ary events with parliamentary routine .

		He plays his old game of constitutional tricks in face of abysms and the dreadful upheavals of the chimerical and unex - pected ... All his life he has been stroking cats , and coaxing them with all sorts of cajoling processes and feline ways .

		To-day he is trying to play the same game , and does not see that the animals have grown beyond all measure and that it is wild beasts that he is keeping about him .

		A strange sight it is to see this little man trying to stroke the roaring mussle of a revo - lution with his little band .

		... I have always enter - tained towards this celebrated statesman , this eminent orator , this mediocre writer , this narrow-minded man , an indefinable sentiment of admiration , aversion , and disdain . ''

		The sketch of Lamartine conveys that poet 's own opinion of some of his political colleagues -LRB- 1850 -RRB- .

		11 During the session
Lamartine	PERSON	came and sat beside me in the place usually occupied by
M. Arbey	ORGANIZATION	.

		While talking , he interjected in an undertone sarcastic remarks about the orators in the tribune .

		Thiers spoke . '

		Little scamp , ' murmured
Lamartine	PERSON	.

		Then Cavaignac made his appearance . '

		What do you think about him ? '

		said
Lamartine	PERSON	.

		` For my part , these are my sentiments : He is fortunate , he is brave , he is loyal , he is voluble and he is stupid . '

		THE DIAL 357 ascended the tribune . '

		I do not know how they can see a serpent in this man , ' said
Lamartine	PERSON	. '

		He is a provincial academician . '

		Laughing the while , he took a sheet of paper from my desk , asked me for a pen , asked Savatier-Laroche for a pinch of snuff , and wrote a few lines .

		This done , he mounted the tribune and addressed grave and haughty words to
M. Thiers	PERSON	, who had been attacking the revolution of
February	DATE	.

		Then he returned to qur bench , shook hands with me while the Left ap - plauded and the Right waxed indignant , and calmly emptied the snuff in Savatier-Laroche 's snuffbox into his own . ''

		The author 's account of the siege of
Paris	LOCATION	, as he saw and endured it , is decidedly interest - ing , and is made up of extracts from note - books , private and personal notes jotted down from day to day .

		On the whole , the volume is a rich and entertaining one not , in form and tenor , just what we expected and hoped to find it , but never - theless one which amply repays perusal .

		MR.
FISKE	PERSON	'S `` DUTCH AND QUAKER COLONIES . ''

		* The latest addition to Mr.
John Fiske	PERSON	's popular historical series is plainly marked by the well-known characteristics of its author wide reading , affluence of interesting facts and ideas , firm grasp of materials , great literary skill , fondness for episodes , keen enjoyment of the picturesque , much ingenuity in hypothesis and explanation , proneness to generalization , ardent Americanism , and greater conformity to truth in the picture than in the single stroke .

		Still further , no subject that occurs in the series is better suited to his peculiar genius than the Dutch and
Quaker Colonies	ORGANIZATION	; perhaps no other is so well suited to it .

		Until recently , and even now in diminished degree , the larger sources of interest in our early history have been found in
Virginia	LOCATION	and
New England	LOCATION	particularly in
New England	LOCATION	, for the reason in part , no doubt , that
New England	LOCATION	writers have con - tributed more than any other group of writers to our historical scholarship and literature ; but discerning men are now coming to see that , if the two great middle colonies exerted less po - litical influence down to the Revolution than
Virginia	LOCATION	and
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, they nevertheless possess abundant elements that have an interest of their own .

		From the point of view fur - nished by the word '' people , ''
Massachusetts	LOCATION	and
Connecticut	LOCATION	, and even
Virginia	LOCATION	, are tame and monotonous compared with
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	* THB DUTCH AND
QUAKER	ORGANIZATION	COLONIES IN
AMERICA	LOCATION	.

		By
John Fiake	PERSON	.

		In two volumes , with maps .


Boston	LOCATION	:
Hough	PERSON	- ton ,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		or even with
New York	LOCATION	.

		The population of
New England	LOCATION	and
Virginia	LOCATION	, being almost purely English , was much more homogeneous than that of the English colonies ; the main stream of political development or progress ran far straighter and deeper ; they were much better fitted for political leadership when a national sentiment began to show itself , which leader - ship they naturally assumed ; and for these very reasons , or at least for some of them , they are less picturesque and poetic than
New York	LOCATION	and
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	.

		Even elements in these colonies that are dull in themselves become interesting when studied in combination .

		Such is Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	's opportunity , and he makes the most of it .

		Whatever may have been his previous view , no intelligent reader of the work is likely to lay it down thinking that either it or the subject is dull and uninteresting .

		The stereotyped phrase '' the author plunges at once into his subject '' will not apply in this case .

		The Introduction proper is two chapters , '' The Mediaeval Netherlands '' and '' Dutch In - fluence upon
England	LOCATION	, '' together comprising 57 pages .

		While both chapters are interesting and throw needed light upon the subject , the introduction seems out of proportion to the body of the work , especially as it has no direct bearing upon the history of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	.

		The author lingers too long in the index .

		He does not bring Peter Minuet to
Manhattan	LOCATION	until page 120 is reached .

		At the beginning of the second chapter , we are glad to find Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	setting right those good people who have accepted the crude gener - alizations propounded by Mr.
Douglass	PERSON	Camp - bell in his well-known book , `` The Puritan in
England	LOCATION	,
Holland	LOCATION	, and
America	LOCATION	. ''

		Consider - ing the undeniable facts that , collectively , the Thirteen Colonies were English colonies , and that the core of the American people has al - ways been English , the proposition that their most characteristic institutions are nevertheless Dutch is , on the face of it , a bold one ; but such is the love of novelty and paradox , of bold generalization and confident assertion , strength - ened in this case , according to our author , by patriotic bias on the one hand and anglophobia on the other , that it has still obtained consider - able currency .

		And this notwithstanding the plain fact that there was less of democracy and more of autocracy in
New Netherland	LOCATION	than in any one of the English colonies .

		Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	very properly tells us that , in such matters , it is im - portant to remember the difference between vost hoc and propter hoc ; and he illustrates it THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, by the conclusive refutation of one of the main arguments by which Mr.
Campbell	PERSON	supported his thesis . ''

		For example , if in the sixteenth century we find free public schools in operation in the
Netherlands	LOCATION	but not in
England	LOCATION	, we must beware of too hastily inferring that the free schools of
New England	LOCATION	in the seven - teenth century were introduced or copied from
Holland	LOCATION	.

		A different explanation is quite possible .

		One of the cardinal requirements of democratic Calvinism has always been elementary education for everybody .

		In matters of religion all souls are equally concerned , and each individual is ultimately responsible for himself .

		The Scriptures are the rule of life , and accordingly each individual ought to be able to read them for him - self , without dependence upon priests .

		Hence it is one of the prime duties of a congregation to insist that all its members shall know how to read , and if necessary to provide them with the requisite instruction .

		In ac - cordance with this Calvinistic idea some form of uni - versal and compulsory elementary education sprang up during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries wherever Calvinism had become dominant , in the Protestant parts of
France	LOCATION	and
Switzerland	LOCATION	, in
Scotland	LOCATION	, in
the Netherlands	LOCATION	, and in
New England	LOCATION	.

		Obviously , then , it might be held that free schools in
New England	LOCATION	were a natural development of Calvinism , and do not neces - sarily imply any especially close relation with
Holland	PERSON	. ''

		Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	by no means denies that the Dutch exerted an influence upon
America	LOCATION	indirectly through
England	LOCATION	and directly through
New Netherland	LOCATION	; on the contrary , he concedes so much influence that , in fact , he sometimes en - dangers his own distinction between post and propter .

		However , the question is one of a very difficult class of questions that can be answered only in general terms , and men will differ about them .

		One of the most interesting passages to the student of political history is that in which the author points out that while Englishmen in
America	LOCATION	rose superior to their former political level in
England	LOCATION	,
Dutchmen	ORGANIZATION	fell below theirs in
Holland	LOCATION	, and then states his explanation of the curious phenomena .

		We can only draw attention to the passage , and pass on .

		In
Nornmbega	LOCATION	, Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	finds one of those side topics that never fail to fascinate him .

		He devotes to it ten pages .

		The region , the river , and the town that bear the name '' Norumbega '' roll about the sixteenth century maps in a way to discourage attempts at locating them ; but Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	, with his usual love of solutions , happily succeeds in placing them all .

		The re - gion gives him little trouble ; but not so the river and the town .

		He follows Mr.
Weise	PERSON	in identifying the river with the
Hudson	LOCATION	, and
Mercator	ORGANIZATION	in placing the town on
Manhattan Island	LOCATION	.

		As respects the town , it would seem as though this were sufficiently definite for what is at most little more than a will-o ' - the - wisp ; but it does not satisfy our author .

		* We further learn that the French Fort of Norom - begue was situated on a small island -LSB- or partly sub - merged isthmus -RSB- in a lake upon the island of
Manhattan	LOCATION	.

		In other words , it was a little north of the present
City Hall	ORGANIZATION	.

		The lake , which the Dutch used to call some - times the Collect , sometimes the Fresh Water , was a familiar feature in
New York	LOCATION	until after the present century had come in .


John Fitch	PERSON	used it for experi - ments with a small steamboat in
1796	DATE	. ''

		We are then told that '' the subject is not one which admits of dogmatic assurance . ''

		The same chapter furnishes a second exam - ple of the author 's love of episodes .

		As intro - ductory to his narrative of
Henry Hudson	PERSON	and his discoveries , he gives a lengthy account of a group of men in
London	LOCATION	, some of them con - nected with the
Muscovite Company	ORGANIZATION	, whose names are spelled Hudson ,
Herdson	LOCATION	, and some thirty other ways .

		The question is whether the great navigator belongs to this family , if indeed they constitute a family . ''

		Into the relationships of these worthies we can go just far enough to be tantalized , for in matters of gen - ealogy a miss is as bad as a mile ; but there are fair grounds for believing them all to have been kinsmen .

		It has been conjectured that
Henry Hudson	PERSON	the
Navi	PERSON	- gator was the grandson of Alderman Hudson . ''

		So a '' conjecture '' only comes out of the '' tan - talizing '' inquiry .

		Why , then , give so much space to it ?

		This is the answer : '' We learn from documents collected by Hakluyt that it was a custom for members of the
Muscovy Company	ORGANIZATION	to apprentice their children to the art of navi - gation for the
Company	ORGANIZATION	's service .

		It therefore seems highly probable that
Henry Hudson	PERSON	, as member of a family which had already for two generations been de - voted to the interests of British navigation , had grown up in the employ of the Company . ''

		The custom of the members of the company is an interesting one , and we should be glad to know that
Henry Hudson	PERSON	was bred up in such a service ; but even Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	, at the beginning of his inquiry , finds the word '' conjecture '' strong enough to express his faith , although he reaches '' highly probable '' in the end , in what is at best but a '' tantalizing inquiry . ''

		We regret to see that Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	has not looked into schools and education in
New York	LOCATION	and
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	as carefully as he had pre - viously done in
New England	LOCATION	and
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		This is the more to be regretted because it is not so very long ago that educational circles were somewhat agitated by the question of the relative merits of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	in public school pioneering .

		He treats of schools in the
United Netherlands	LOCATION	, but we do not recall a word in regard to schools in
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 359
New Netherland	LOCATION	.

		He deals with Van der
Donck	PERSON	and his associates , but does not mention the significant words concerning a public school that they inserted in the '' Reasons and Causes , '' etc. , that they caused to be sent to
Amsterdam	LOCATION	.

		He does full justice to the
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	indifference to higher education , and assigns it to its proper cause ; which is an admirable example of the practical efficacy of theological opinions . ''

		In spite of their liberalism , the Quakers attached far less importance to education than the
Puritans of New England	ORGANIZATION	.

		The majority of their preachers and instructors were men of high moral tone and spiritual insight with scant learning , like
George Fox	ORGANIZATION	himself .

		Fox used to say that ' God stood in no need of human learning , ' and that ' Oxford and
Cambridge	LOCATION	could not make a minister . '

		Quakers , in studying the
Bible	LOCATION	, de - pended upon their Inner Light rather than that critical interpretation of texts to which the orthodox Puritans attached so much importance .

		A knowledge of Hebrew , therefore , was not highly valued ; and as for Greek and Latin literature , it was the unsanctified work of pagans , while the poets of
France	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	dealt with worldly and frivolous themes .

		In these respects we must re - member that
Penn	LOCATION	was as far from being a typical
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	as
Milton	LOCATION	, with his pervading artistic sense , his love of music and the theatre , and his long curling hair , was from being a typical Puritan .

		George Fox and
John Cotton	ORGANIZATION	are respectively the typical men .

		The latter , who spent twelve hours a day in study , and said , ' I love to sweeten my mouth with a piece of
Calvin	PERSON	before I go to sleep , ' could write and speak fluently in
Greek	LOCATION	,
Latin	LOCATION	, and Hebrew , besides carrying a ponderous burden of philological , metaphysical , and theological erudition .

		Among the Puritan divines of
New England	LOCATION	, real scholarship was commonly found , and it was some - times of a high order ; and this was because sound scholarship was supposed to be conducive to soundness in doctrines .

		This explains the founding of
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	in the wilderness in
1636	DATE	.

		11 To the
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	, whose mind was directly illuminated by light from above , this elaborate equipment was mere rubbish .

		It was , therefore , not strange that in colonial times the higher education in
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	owed little to Quakers . ''

		Still , it must be said that not all the early Quakers were obscurantists as respects the higher education ; such men as
Barclay	LOCATION	, author of the '' Apology , ''
Ellwood	PERSON	, who read the classics to
Milton	PERSON	in his blindness , and
Penn	LOCATION	himself had a genuine love of learning .

		Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	adds that the Quakers were nevertheless careful , as people of practical sense , to teach their children the three R 's , and speaks of the early schools of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	; but he does not tell us that , although
Penn	LOCATION	strove to avert such a result , the Quakers of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, with the full control of the Assembly in their hands down to the Revolution , still never set up even the semblance of a public school system , which was really due to their religion , and so confirms the paragraph quoted above .

		On the other hand , the Dutch in
New York	LOCATION	, while by no means establishing a common-school system , did enough educational work to show that they were of the Calvinistic lineage .

		Nor can we think that Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	does full justice to the
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	Germans .

		The German Bible that they published at German - town thirty-nine years before an English Bible had appeared in any one of the colonies , is just one of those facts that we should have ex - pected Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	to pick up in his reading ; but he does not seem to have done so , or at least does not mention it .

		We close as we began : the book is thor - oughly characteristic of its author , and will be accounted one of the brilliant pieces of histor - ical writing of its period .

		THREE-QUARTERS OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY .

		* Mr.
John Sartain	PERSON	's u Reminiscences of a Very Old Man '' cover the most magnificent period of the world 's history ; for surely never was more done for civilization than during a life which includes the years from
1808	DATE	to
1897	DATE	.

		Mr.
Sartain	PERSON	was born in
London	LOCATION	, and there spent his youth .

		His keen memory runs back to his sixth year , when he was carried by his father to the Peace Jubilee of
1814	DATE	, to view the gay scenes by day and the fireworks at night .

		And then to school .

		Why children were sent to such cruel masters one of
Sar	ORGANIZATION	- tain 's was Tom Crib , ex - champion pugilist of
England	LOCATION	stands as a mystery to us to-day .

		By the time the lad was ten years old , flogging not for demerit , but on the principle laid down by
Solomon	ORGANIZATION	had so embittered him with school that nothing could induce him to go fur - ther with it .

		His life-work began
two years later	DATE	.

		While digging in a trench in a neigh - bor 's garden , overlooked by the laboratory of the Italian pyrotechnist and scene-painter Mortram , that worthy 's attention was attracted to the vigorous manner in which young
Sartain	PERSON	was handling his shovel the truth being that the boy was in a fit of temper at the time .

		Mortrarn bespoke the services of so diligent an assistant , and
Sartain	PERSON	went to work for him .

		Among other things ,
Mortram	PERSON	was in charge of the department of '' steam , smoke , and fire '' at
Charles Kemble	PERSON	's play-house , the Theatre RECOLLECTIONS OF A VERT OLD MAN : 1808-1897 .

		By
John Sartain	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		: ir , o THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	,
Royal	ORGANIZATION	, Covent Garden ; and the life with him was hard but not monotonous .

		The boy was in daily contact with the popular players of the day ,
Farren	PERSON	,
Abbott	LOCATION	, Mrs.
Chatterton	PERSON	, Mr. and Mrs.
Fawcett	PERSON	, and the accomplished songstress
Miss Stephens	PERSON	, who was to become
Countess of Essex	ORGANIZATION	.

		Occasionally
Kemble	PERSON	's lovely daughter Fanny was to be seen by the admiring lad , but she was too young for any professional connec - tion with the theatre .

		Always fond of his pencil , it was behind the scenes that
Sartain	PERSON	's abilities obtained their first recognition ,
Mort	LOCATION	- rain sending him to make a sketch of the '' White Horse Cellar '' in
Piccadilly	LOCATION	, a view of which was wanted for a piece in rehearsal .

		Though sufficiently contented with his work under
Mortrara	PERSON	, after various changes
John Sartain	PERSON	was apprenticed , at the age of fourteen , to
John Swaine	PERSON	, in order to learn the art of engraving .

		The work was purely commercial , cutting names on door-plates , dog-collars , and the like .

		But
William Young Ottley	PERSON	chanced to see some scraps of line-work from the boy 's hand , and borrowed him from his master to aid him in completing a work begun thirty years before in
Rome	LOCATION	a piece of splen - did good-luck for his pupil .

		This was nothing less than `` The Early Florentine School , '' a folio of engravings from the works of the masters of
Florence	LOCATION	, including examples of their best compositions during two centuries and a half .


Ottley	PERSON	was known not only as a most learned antiquary in art matters but as an accomplished artist , and within the year
Sartain	PERSON	had engraved three plates throughout , two after
Bennozo Gossoli	PERSON	and the third after
Giotto	ORGANIZATION	.

		This work , naturally congenial , was performed in
Ottley	ORGANIZATION	's gallery , amid surround - ings which were in themselves an education .

		Mr.
Sartain	PERSON	presently returned to
Swaine	ORGANIZATION	and his task-work , but was permitted to take orders outside , and finally succeeded in buying off the rest of his time .

		He then became the pupil of Richter for eight months , escaping from that taskmaster with considerable diffi - culty to set up for himself , engraving fancy subjects on order from publishers , but finding his greatest profit in individual portraits .

		The chance meeting with a young engraver in stip - ple , who urged going to
America	LOCATION	, turned
Sar	ORGANIZATION	- tain 's thoughts in that direction ; and , after marrying the daughter of
Swaine	LOCATION	, he embarked for
Philadelphia	LOCATION
July 4 , 1830	DATE	, taking with him an abundance of letters of introduction .

		After satisfying himself that a livelihood was obtainable in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, and being greatly encouraged thereby ,
Sartain	PERSON	went to
New York	LOCATION	and delivered his letters there .

		Among many others he met Sully , the portrait painter , who was warm in his commendation of Penu 's capi - tal , and urged him to settle there , at the same time giving him his portrait of Bishop White to engrave .

		With orders from
Henry C. Carey	PERSON	and
Thomas T. Ash	PERSON	, both publishers , and from
John Neagle	PERSON	the artist , as well , success was already assured a man of
Sartain	PERSON	's abilities , and he henceforth reckoned
Philadelphia	LOCATION	as his home .

		There are interesting tales of his fellow - artists , and of the somewhat deplorable con - dition of the Academy of Fine Arts in
Chestnut	LOCATION	street ; and we are reminded that
Rebecca	PERSON	, the beautiful daughter of
Herman Gratz	PERSON	, for many years
Sartain	PERSON	's colleague on the board of the
Academy	ORGANIZATION	, was the original of the
Rebecca	PERSON	in Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	's '' Ivanhoe , ''
Washington	LOCATION	Irving having told the great novelist of her many beauties of mind and body .

		In
January , 1841	DATE	,
George R. Graham	PERSON	pub - lished the first number of ``
Graham	PERSON	's
Maga	PERSON	- zine . ''

		One of its features was an original engraving from
Sartain	PERSON	's hand , a new plate to accompany each number .

		The success of the enterprise was a surprise to
Graham	PERSON	himself , and it brought him so many offers to engage in enticing schemes that he soon left the magazine to run itself .

		As a result , in
1848	DATE	everything was sold to satisfy his creditors , leaving the engraver the opportunity to begin the publication of ``
Sartain	PERSON	's
Union Magazine	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		For eighteen months
Edgar Allan Poe	PERSON	was assistant editor of ``
Graham	PERSON	's Magazine , '' with a salary of
eight hundred dollars	MONEY	a year ; and there is nothing in the book of more interest than the intimacy which grew up between
Sar	ORGANIZATION	- tain and
Poe	PERSON	.

		This lasted through the estab - lishment of the '' Union Magazine , '' and many of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's most notable works found publication in its pages , '' The Bells '' among others .

		Mr.
Sartain	PERSON	tells us that ``
Annabel Lee	PERSON	'' was the last poem
Poe	PERSON	ever wrote .

		It was bought for his periodical , but before publication it was found that it had already been sold to three other publishers .

		A most unhappy glimpse of the poet 's compounded misfortunes is told in these words : `` The last time I saw Mr.
Poe	PERSON	was late in
1849	DATE	, and then under such peculiar and almost fearful conditions that the experience can never fade from my memory .

		Early one
Monday	DATE
afternoon	TIME	he suddenly entered my engraving room , looking pale and haggard , witli a wild and frightened expression in his eyes .

		I did not let him see that I noticed it , and shaking him cordially by the hand invited him to be seated , when he began , ' Mr.
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 361
Sartain	PERSON	, I have come to you for a refuge and protec - tion ; will you let me stay with you ?

		It is necessary to my safety that I lie concealed for a time . '

		I assured him that he was welcome , that in my house he would be perfectly safe , and that he could stay as long as he liked , but asked him what was the matter ... After he had had time to calm down a little , he told me that he had been on his way to
New York	LOCATION	, but he had over - heard some men who sat a few seats back of him plotting how they should kill him and then throw him from the platform of the car .

		He said they spoke so low that it would have been impossible for him to hear and un - derstand the meaning of their words , had it not been that his sense of hearing was so wonderfully acute .

		They could not guess that he heard them , as he sat so quiet and apparently indifferent to what was going on , but when the train arrived at the
Bordentown	LOCATION	station he gave them the slip and remained concealed until the cars moved on again .

		He had returned to
Phila	LOCATION	- delphia by the first train back , and hurried to me for refuge . ''

		Mr.
Sartain	PERSON	tried to reassure his guest by tell - ing him that he had imagined all these things .

		He did more : he took
Poe	PERSON	home with him , gave him his slippers to take the place of shoes too much worn for further service , and after sup - per took him out to walk .

		Poe was at the point of suicide , and in no respect his own master .

		While they were together that evening , others of the poet 's imaginary experiences were con - fided to his friend , one of them in this language , as nearly as Mr.
Sartain	PERSON	can recollect it : '' ' I was confined to a cell in
Moyamensing Prison	LOCATION	, and through my grated window was visible the battle - mented granite tower .

		On the topmost stone of the parapet , between the embrasures , stood perched against the sky a young female brightly radiant , like silver dipped in light , either in herself or her environment , so that the cross-bar shadows thrown from my window were distinct on the opposite wall .

		From this position , remote as it was , she addressed to me a series of ques - tions in words not loud but distinct , and I dared not fail to hear and make response .

		Had I failed once either to hear or to make pertinent answer , the con - sequences to me would have been something fearful ; but my sense of hearing is wonderfully acute , so that I passed safely through this ordeal , which was a snare to catch me . ' ''

		These imaginings of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	are told at great length , and are all of the same character .

		Sartain kept the perturbed spirit with him un - til rest and good food had worked a partial recovery , when
Poe	PERSON	resumed his interrupted journey to
New York	LOCATION	.

		Sartain never saw him again .

		Within a month he lay dead in the hospital at
Baltimore	LOCATION	.

		Of the last days of
Edgar Allan Poe	PERSON	on earth ,
Sartain	PERSON	has this to say a statement which contradicts much that has been written of him , notably the memoir of Professor Woodbury : '' In those -LSB- last -RSB- few weeks how much had happened , and how hopeful seemed the prospects for his future .

		He -LSB-
Poe	PERSON	-RSB- had joined a temperance society , delivered lectures , resumed friendly relations with an early flame of his , Mrs.
Sarah E. Shelton	PERSON	, and become engaged to her .

		Dr.
John J. Moran	PERSON	, who attended the poet in his last moments , says that
Poe	PERSON	parted from her at her residence in
Richmond	LOCATION	at four in the afternoon of Oct -
ober 4 , 1849	DATE	, to go north .

		She states that when he said ' good-bye ' he paused a moment as if reflecting , and then said to her , ' I have a singular feeling amount - ing to a presentiment , that this will be our last meeting until we meet to part no more , ' and then walked slowly and sadly away .

		Reaching the
Susquehanna	LOCATION	, he refused to venture across because of the wildness of the storm - driven water , and he returned to
Baltimore	LOCATION	.

		Alighting from the cars , he was seen to turn down Pratt street on the south side , followed by two suspicious looking char - acters as far as the south-west corner of Pratt and Light streets .

		A fair presumption is that they got him into one of the abominable places that lined the wharf , drugged him , and robbed him of everything .

		After daybreak , on the morning of the sixth , a gentleman found him stretched unconscious upon a broad plank across some barrels on the sidewalk .

		Recognizing him , he obtained a hack and gave the driver a card with Mr.
Moran	PERSON	's address on it and on the lower right-hand cor - ner the name of '
Poe	PERSON	. ' ''

		At the hospital he was disrobed of the wretched apparel which had been exchanged for his good clothing of the day before , and he was put comfortably to bed .

		After consciousness returned the doctor said to him , ` Mr.
Poe	PERSON	, you are extremely weak ; pulse very low ; I will give yon a glass of toddy . '

		He answered , ' Sir , if I thought its potency would transport me to the Elysian bowers of the undiscovered spirit world , I would not take it . '

		Then I will give you an opiate to ensure you sleep and rest . '

		He replied , ' Twin sister-spectre to the doomed and crazed mortals of earth and perdition . '

		The doctor records he found no tremor of his person , no unsteadiness of his nerves , no fidgetting with his hands , and not the slightest odour of liquor on his breath or person .


Poe	PERSON	said after a sip or two of cold water , ' Doctor , it 's all over . '

		Dr.
Moran	PERSON	confirmed his belief that his end was near , and asked if he had any word or wish for his friends .

		He answered , ' Never - more , ' and continued , < He who arched the heavens and upholds the universe has His decrees legibly written upon the frontlet of every human being and upon devils incarnate . '

		These were his last words , his glassy eyes rolled back , a slight tremor , and the immortal soul of
Edgar Allan Poe	PERSON	passed into the spirit world ,
October 7 , 1849	DATE	, aged thirty-eight .

		The accepted statement that
Poe	PERSON	died in a drunken debauch is attested by Dr.
Moran	PERSON	to be a calumny .

		He died from a chill caused by exposure during the night under a cold
October	DATE	sky , clad only in the thin old bombazine coat and trousers which had been substituted for his own warm clothing . ''

		Mr.
Sartain	PERSON	has an interesting paragraph on the honoraria paid to authors while he was publishing his magazine .

		He says : ''
Longfellow	PERSON	never received less than
fifty dollars	MONEY	each for his numerous articles .


Horace Binney Wal	PERSON	- lace was paid forty dollars for his article on Washing - ton Irving , and
Poe	PERSON	received
forty-five dollars	MONEY	for ' The Bells . '

		In the form he first submitted it , consisting of eighteen lines of small merit , he received fifteen dollars ; but after he had rewritten and improved it to a hun - dred and thirteen lines he was paid thirty dollars more .

		THE DIAL -LSB-

		Dr.
Bethune	PERSON	's four-page articles on '
Aunt Betsy	PERSON	' brought him fifty dollars each .


Nathaniel P. Willis	PERSON	and
Joseph R. Chandler	PERSON	received fifty dollars each for their five or six page articles , and
Francis J. Grand	PERSON
sixty-five dollars	MONEY	for his article on Kossuth .


John Neal	PERSON	was paid
twenty-five dollars	MONEY	for ' What is Poetry ? '

		and Professor
Joseph Alden	PERSON	averaged
thirty-five dollars	MONEY	for each of his contributions .

		Miss
Brown	PERSON	and
Edith	PERSON	and
Caroline May	PERSON	averaged about ten or twelve dollars a poem , and
William Do	PERSON	we was content to receive
four dollars	MONEY	a page for his prose , a page holding nearly nine hundred words .

		Many poems of merit were printed that cost only
five dollars	MONEY	each , it being well understood that the name is valued as well as the writing . ''

		Of a most interesting journey abroad in
1863	DATE	, of the founding of the art schools of the
Pennsylvania Academy	LOCATION	, of the part taken in the art collections of the Centennial
Exposi	PERSON	- tion , and of many other matters which have left
America	LOCATION	greatly in
John Sartain	PERSON	's debt , there is no room to speak .

		The book de - serves to be read as a whole .

		It is well written , delightfully illustrated , and an excel - lent compendium of art extending over many years .

		A MAX OF THE THEOLOGICAL , RENAIS - SANCE IN
NEW ENGLAND	LOCATION	.

		* For a generation , the memory of
Horace Bushnell	PERSON	has been held in reverence and grat - itude , perhaps all the deeper because so many of his own contemporaries saw in him so much of heresy and danger .

		Within a certain group of theologians , it is true , this prejudice still holds sway ; but its existence is a tribute to their own Philistine logic or '' dodge , '' as
Jowett	PERSON	called the process .

		As a matter of fact , there is probably not to-day an evangelical thinker who is genuinely modern that is , one who is moved by the scientific rather than the metaphysical impulse who would not find himself thoroughly in sympathy with
Bush	PERSON	- nell 's main positions .

		It is hard to imagine the
New England	LOCATION	out of which
Bushnell	ORGANIZATION	sprang and whose closely - wrought theology he abandoned first as an ag - nostic before the Agnostics , and then as the representative of religious life rather than of dogma .

		Dr.
Munger	PERSON	has admirably described the `` New England theology '' as it strove to 44 improve ''
Edwards	PERSON	; to rationalize a
Hopkins	PERSON	- HOBACB BUSHMILL .

		ism whose shibboleth was one 's willingness to be damned for the glory of God ; and , above all , to share in the incipient liberating move - ment of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	without giving up the su - premacy of a logic '' as faultless as unconvinc - ing . ''

		From all the algebra of the schools , Dr.
Bushnell	PERSON	appealed to experience and life .

		God was something more to him than a dogma ; the
Trinity	ORGANIZATION	, something more than a puzzle for metaphysicians ; and religion something more than tradition .

		At his best , he was not a logi - cian , and his least satisfactory thought is that in which , not yet able to break quite away from the spirit of his time , he deemed it necessary to use the methods of the formal thinker .

		In his own estimation ,
Bushnell	PERSON	's chief duty un - doubtedly lay in a re-statement of the current evangelicalism , from a different point of view and with a greater reliance upon the data fur - nished by nature and human experience .

		In reality , he started men toward the more help - ful and rational if less systematic theology that endeavors to re-shape religious teaching on a foundation broader than texts wrenched from any portion of the Scripture , and , whether poetry or vision or history or aspiration or oriental apalogue , treated like definitions cast in the mould of
Aquinas	PERSON	or
Calvin	PERSON	, and ar - ranged according to the inevitable processes of Aristotle .

		And therefore it was that he became the sweetening , broadening influence that he was and is , a man of the theological Renais - sance in
New England	LOCATION	.

		It is a matter of congratulation that Dr.
Munger	PERSON	has told so fairly the story of Dr.
Bushnell	PERSON	's life , with its struggles with zealous critics , and has discussed his teachings so sym - pathetically .

		For we are not without the dog - matist to-day , and popular theology is still in need of the emancipation and sanity and re - ligious fervor that speaks in Bushneirs treat - ises , and above all in his sermons .

		The illustrations are numerous and chosen with fair judgment , although the selection of portraits is now and then questionable , as in the case of Mr.

		THE DIAL 363 THE WAR WITH
SPAIN	LOCATION	, AND AFTER .

		* The later books dealing with the war with
Spain	LOCATION	and its results differ for the most part from those reviewed in THE DIAL soon after the cessation of hostilities .

		Nearly all the works having historical pretension make an honest attempt to deal fairly with the facts , omitting self-praise and commenting adversely upon some of the details of our conduct of the war , on the one side ; while on the other , a glittering imperialism leads to the bewilderment of history in the volumes dealing with the war at second-hand , and arguments strange to American ears are used to bolster up European ideas of colo - nies and conquests .

		Mr.
Henry Cabot Lodge	PERSON	's account of '' The War with
Spain	LOCATION	'' exhibits him as an ardent partisan and a good hater , with but little of the historian 's patience in research or capacity for impartiality .

		His book is sometimes violent , frequently unfair , and often untrue .

		He professes a seventh-day admiration for
Great Britain	LOCATION	which leaves us won - dering for his sincerity ; while in
Spain	LOCATION	he sees neither the gallant adversary nor the defeated foe , but rather the sum of all iniquities brought low by the decrees of
Jehovah	ORGANIZATION	.

		His admiration for
Great Britain	LOCATION	he shares with admiration for Rear - Admiral
Sampson	PERSON	, while his detestation of
Spain	LOCATION	includes a detestation of Rear-Admiral
Schley	PERSON	.

		Holding a brief for the one , he does not scruple to write the other down , et suppressio veri et suggestio falsi being freely used to that end .

		The result is unhappy ; yet the book is so generally inaccurate that these things are merely incidental .

		By way of example , Mr. Lodge makes it appear -LRB- page 20 -RRB- that President
Cleveland	LOCATION	was blameworthy for respecting the nation 's treaty obligations with
Spain	LOCATION	in respect of filibustering ; he suppresses all mention of the representation of the
Six Great Powers of Europe	ORGANIZATION	to President
McKinley	PERSON	on
April 7 , 1898	DATE	, though such action is as mischievous in its possibilities as it is unprecedented in our history ; he makes no mention of
Spain	LOCATION	's offer to arbitrate its differences with this country and our absolutely unexplained refusal of that request ; be quotes -LRB- page 31 -RRB- Cap - * THE WAR WITH

Sigsbee	ORGANIZATION	's mere surmise as positive proof that Spanish officials had guilty knowledge of the
Maine	LOCATION	's destruction ; he follows the new fashion of decrying the fathers of the country and the Decla - ration of Independence by calling the Congressional resolution '' That the people of
the Island of Cuba	LOCATION	are , and of right ought to be , free and independent , '' '' purely rhetorical '' just as it was '' when
Richard Henry Lee	PERSON	first read it to the
Continental	ORGANIZATION	Con - gress '' -LRB- page 42 -RRB- ; he invents -LRB- page 51 -RRB- bright moonlight for the end of Admiral
Dewey	PERSON	's voyage on the
night	TIME	of
April 30 , 1898	DATE	, and , having invented it , is forced to invent a stoppage of the American squadron off Corregidor until the supposititious moon can set ; he blames -LRB- page 77 -RRB-
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, the people , and the press , for the scandals in the various bureaus of the War Department though he is careful not to mention what these were nor the fatal results which flowed from them when it is certain that it lay within the powers of the Chief Executive to do away with the cause of them ; he omits all statement of the outrageous nepotism which put the `` sons of somebody '' -LRB- a Spanish phrase -RRB- in positions for which they were unfitted ; he actually blames
Schley	PERSON	-LRB- page 89 , note -RRB- because
Sampson	PERSON	did not furnish the
Navy Department	ORGANIZATION	with a copy of the note in which he orders
Schley	PERSON	to remain off Cien - fuegos ; he omits the date of
Hobson	PERSON	's sinking the Merrimac ; he asserts an absolute untruth in saying that
Sampson	PERSON	was within '' easy signal distance '' of the American ships throughout the battle of
July 3	DATE	-LRB- page 138 -RRB- , and so on , with blunders , embellishments , exaggerations , and untruths of the same sort on nearly every page .

		But those who recall the atti - tude of Mr. Lodge toward
Great Britain	LOCATION	, patent in his speeches in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and his previous books at all times , will wonder most at the comfort he can now extract from
England	LOCATION	's '' old red ensign , '' now '' looking very friendly and very welcome , '' and at his open advocacy of an alliance with that once detested power .

		He is seemingly unaware of that better English opinion , voiced by the poet upon our declaration of war , thus : '' The sly Freebooters of the Earth Open their ranks , to welcome in The youngest Race God brought to birth , By serpent reasons lured to sin . '' '

		Peace and goodwill ' the promise failed As soon as made , erased with gore ; And once again the Christ is haled Behind the reeking wheels of war . ''

		Governor
Roosevelt	PERSON	's account of his regiment , `` The Rough Riders , '' is surcharged with that en - thusiasm which has characterized his public life .

		Other regiments have been more famous in history , but none illustrates so thoroughly the possibilities of modern newspaper advertisement as his .

		That it surpassed by even a little many of the other commands , both regular and volunteer , in any re - spect save in the publicity given its movements , no one is quicker to deny than its gallant colonel here ; that it did anything more than its duty , he is no less 3G4 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, eager to contradict ; yet this is the second or third large volume devoted exclusively to the history of this one regiment .

		Such chronicling certainly tends toward giving a disproportionate sense of even its great deserts , just as the stress laid upon its somewhat miscellaneous personnel is likely to leave the impression that American volunteer regi - ments generally are not taken from widely varied classes of which we used not to hear so much in the communities which send them forth .

		If the book does not err on the side of modesty , it is cer - tainly readable , and the men it celebrates deserve well at the hands of their countrymen .

		An admirable book in nearly all respects is the '' Reminiscences of the
Santiago	LOCATION	Campaign '' which Captain
John Bigelow	PERSON	,
U. S. A.	PERSON	, has felt impelled to write .

		Brother to that Mr.
Poulteney Bigelow	PERSON	whose patriotic outspokenness respecting the lack of preparation for the
Santiago	LOCATION	campaign earned the criticism of Mr.
R. H. Davis	PERSON	and others , Cap - tain
Bigelow	PERSON	is equally plain in his arraignment of the authorities for permitting this and other similar abuses .

		Yet he permits himself to be distracted from the real issue by holding the people to blame for the political appointments to military positions , advancing proof of this by showing that
Congres	PERSON	- sional influence was generally at work .

		Similar attempts have been made to hold the former Secre - tary of War accountable for such errors .

		Unless we are to go to the point of a responsible min - istry and an impeccable head of the government at a breath , it requires nothing more than re-statement to show that the Chief Executive is constitutionally responsible in these cases , and not his subordinates and appointees , nor yet the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		The con - cluding chapter in the book is of great value , and Captain
Bigelow	PERSON	should be listened to when he avers the possibility of increasing the efficiency of our regular army at least three-tenths , without adding to its numbers as so many seem eager to do in the face of all national tradition .

		Tom
Hall	PERSON	, well known to the readers of the lighter magazines as a frequent contributor in both prose and verse , was adjutant of the
First United States Volunteer Cavalry	ORGANIZATION	during the Cuban war .

		He supports Captain
Bigelow	PERSON	by the relation of his experiences in
Cuba	LOCATION	, which he calls '' The Fun and Fighting of the Rough Riders . ''

		The '' fun , '' it is curious to relate , was afforded largely by the blun - ders of the regular soldiers under officers who , like Mr.
Hall	PERSON	, were graduates of the
Military Academy	ORGANIZATION	at
West Point	LOCATION	.

		He bears witness to the mass of inaccurate writing which has overwhelmed the his - tory of the
Santiago	LOCATION	campaign , saying : '' Accounts agree on almost everything that happened in the campaign up to the morning of the
24th of June , 1898	DATE	, the day of the battle of Guasimas battle , skir - mish , surprise , ambush , glorious victory , waste of en - ergy , whichever the reader chooses to call it from his point of view .

		From this time on to the true * , ten days later , no two persons seem to agree .

		Heroism , Ability , Incompetence , Ambition , Jealousy , and their train of attendants , suddenly strode from the wings to the stage , and struggled for the centre and the rays of the lime - light .

		And no sooner did the curtain fall on the scene than the characters grabbed pen and ink and begaa writing about it .

		The result is a mass of historical data fairly appalling in its contradictory evidence .

		The ef - fect of all this upon the present scribe is such that he can look upon all history with a dubious smile and ex - claim at each volume , I wonder why you wrote this , ' and ' I wonder why you wrote that . '

		Men who saw little or nothing of the events of the next ten days have written the most surprising things , and men who were near enough to see have written absolutely amazing things about them .

		The campaign was a short one , but the history that records it will be a long one . ''

		Mr.
Hall	PERSON	, at least , does not fear to tell the truth .

		His estimate of Guasimas can be told from the foregoing ; 1 Caney he calls `` a useless victory , won at an awful cost '' ; and the siege of
Santiago	LOCATION	and the previous fighting are summarized in a preg - nant sentence : '' A siege without siege guns was the logical climax of a battle without tactics and a campaign without strategy . ''

		If the nation were not so slow to see that luck was the chief factor in American success in
Cuba	LOCATION	, military reform would be possible .

		A work of another sort , though no less interest - ing than the best of the others , '' Our Conquests in the
Pacific	LOCATION	, '' is a reprint in book form of the letters sent to the
New York	LOCATION	'' Sun '' from
May	DATE	to Decem - ber ,
1898	DATE	, by its correspondent in
the Philippines	LOCATION	, Mr.
Oscar King Davis	PERSON	.

		Reflecting as a matter of course the pronounced attitude toward the war which his paper identified itself with , Mr.
Davis	PERSON	still gives estimates of the Filipino patriots which are highly encouraging to those advocating local self-government .

		It is interesting to be told that Major-General
Wesley Merritt	PERSON	is not greedy for the sort of fame which is falling upon the shoulders of Major-General
Otis	PERSON	.

		The author , it may be added , was one of the men who protested recently against the latter officer 's suppression and distortion of news .

		Calm , dispassionate , and statistical , Mr.
William Dinwiddie	PERSON	still depends largely upon profuse illus - tration to make his work on
Porto Rico	ORGANIZATION	attractive .

		The fourth or fifth of recent works treating of this island , it is by much the most inclusive .

		Here , too , the actions of the American authorities is sub - jected to searching criticism , as in the case of Major-General Miles 's startling decree fixing the value of the native peso at
fifty cents	MONEY	American .

		Yet he permits the attitude of the Chief Executive in leaving the ports of the island to remain closed against American imports , and the ports of the
United States	LOCATION	to remain similarly closed against
Porto Rican	ORGANIZATION	exports , to pass without animadversion .

		Nothing is said , except in the most general terms , of the distress resulting , which was already acute when the
summer	DATE	hurricane brought the suffering to the point of agony .

		`` The New - Born
Cuba	LOCATION	'' of Mr.
Franklin Ma	PERSON	- thews differs from the preceding volume in being
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 365 largely the work of a newspaper man who is report - ing the condition of the island during the first sixty days of American occupation as seen through the eyes of the officials in charge of its new destinies .

		The author evidently believes that the Congressional resolution which pledges the
United States	LOCATION	to take possession of the island for no longer time than will suffice '' for the pacification thereof '' should be interpreted to mean '' for the permanent pacifi - cation thereof '' which will , of course , mean any - thing the
Administration	ORGANIZATION	chooses to have it mean .

		Deriving his impressions from the military men in harge of
Cuba	LOCATION	, his report is exceedingly favorable to the work they have done , which , indeed , appears to have been excellently well done for the most part .

		He bears ample testimony to the fact that there is no disorder throughout the extent of
Cuba	LOCATION	at this time , and is frank enough to report those American generals correctly who believe in with - drawing now , and leaving its inhabitants to work out their own salvation like the rest of
Latin America	LOCATION	.

		Doctor
Griffis	PERSON	's `` America in the East '' is an intelligent but not too accurate summary of what the
United States	LOCATION	has stood for in
China	LOCATION	,
Japan	LOCATION	, and
Hawaii	LOCATION	, overlaid with much special pleading for the conquest of
the Philippines	LOCATION	in order that the archipelago may be joined to our national domain .

		The annexation of
Hawaii	LOCATION	is gloried in , of course , distrustful as it must make the world of the dis - interestedness of the American missionary .

		All our historical precedents are passed by , of necessity , in order to uphold the policy which is to give us `` empire . ''

		Holding that the tropics are not to be exploited by the white man at the brown man 's expense , the author still appeals to the conduct of the English and Dutch in eastern countries in justi - fication of our own highhandedness .

		Mr.
Benja	PERSON	- min
Kidd	PERSON	's '' Control of the Tropics '' is quoted approvingly up to the moment his argument be - comes effective , then ignored in favor of intangi - bilities .

		History is defied in the surprising theory that `` responsibilities bring with them the capacity for meeting them , '' and the case of President
Arthur	PERSON	is cited against the awful object-lessons of American misconduct in
Alaska	LOCATION	and
Hawaii	LOCATION	, as in our national dealings with the Indian and
the Negro	ORGANIZATION	, which show this to be the most pitiable and con - temptible of fallacies .

		It is a pity that it should be obligatory here , in the face of Dr.
Griffis	PERSON	's other works , to pronounce such a judgment , but this last book of his is a specious appeal away from historical facts and American ideals to the least worthy preju - dices of evangelical Christianity .

		Doctor
Draper	PERSON	, in his book on '' The Rescue of
Cuba	LOCATION	, '' follows in the same uneasy path .

		He extols the war with
Spain	LOCATION	as a precedent in favor of liberty , humanity , and justice , ignoring completely and conveniently the precedents to the contrary estab - lished by the war of conquest now waging against our truculent fellow-citizens , the Tagalos , or by the payment of tribute to our new suzerain , the Sultan of
Sulu	LOCATION	.

		This leads the author , when he comes to discuss imperialism , to limit the objections of those who stand upon the uniform precedents of the
United States	LOCATION	up to the moment of the sinking of
Montojo	ORGANIZATION	's fleet to a single brief paragraph , while he sets forth with evident approval some pages of arguments favoring a completion of the conquest which
Spain	LOCATION	had found impossible .

		He urges that '' the capture of a seat of government ... is con - sidered to carry with it the territory of which it is the capital city , '' though
Washington	LOCATION	was as ignorant of this during the Revolutionary war , so far as
Boston	LOCATION	,

		After such a misreading of history as that , one expects to find German spoliation of French territory advanced as a valid precedent for Ameri - cans to follow .

		This is the first of a series of European examples which we belated Americans are urged to emulate : the islands are rich and un - developed , so it is our duty to develop them , regard - less of compulsory native or coolie labor .

		The islands must be occupied for military purposes and `` to enlarge our power upon the seas , '' a power which will not require enlargement if we leave them to their occupants .

		The islands must be ours so that we can spread the gospel among the heathen or Roman Catholics , as in
Mexico	LOCATION	the good doctor forgetting that he has shown just before , in treating of the
Carolines	LOCATION	, that this result was there effected by simple treaty .

		The islands must be ours because civil turmoil would ensue upon our withdrawal , our present administration of them apparently leaving nothing to be desired in this respect .

		The islands must become American be - cause '' we are bound to establish free institutions where American soldiers have , against armed re - sistance , carried the American flag '' as prepos - terous an argument as was ever used to bolster a bad cause , being absolutely disproved by our sensi - ble refusal to attempt any such thing in the Bar - bary States , in
Canada	LOCATION	, in
Mexico	LOCATION	, and in numerous minor instances of the same sort extending over our entire national history .

		Then comes the curious statement that our policy up to the present time , the policy under which we have acquired our one great - ness in a national reputation for generosity and peacefulness , is finally outgrown , and `` the time has come when our national interests require we shall take our place among the nations and assume our part in managing the affairs of the whole world , '' with a great deal more about '' obeying the impulses of our

		WALLACE RICK .

		Mr.
Bulltn	PERSON	' i BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		We see no reason for the excessive '' ` umbleness '' manifested by Mr.
Frank T. Bullen	PERSON	in the preface to his new book , '' The Log of a Sea-Waif '' -LRB-
Apple	ORGANIZATION	- ton -RRB- .

		Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	starts out by meekly kotowing to certain sea-writers , all but one of whom are , as such , in almost every respect his own inferiors ; and he then indignantly asks himself , '' Who , then , are you , that pretends to compete with these master magicians ? ''

		Not content with this immodest ex - hibition of modesty , he goes on to further abase himself by describing himself as one `` permitted to cater for the reading public in sterling periodicals '' by `` the greatest kindness and indulgence on the part of men '' -LRB- editors and publishers , we suppose -RRB- ' holding high positions in the literary world '' ; and he winds up by styling bis book the '' autobiography of a nobody . '' ''

		Please do n't kick me , '' says the donkey in
Sterne	PERSON	, '' but if you will you may . ''

		Now is Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	, a mariner who has sailed the brine for years and lived on `` salt horse '' for ever so many months at a stretch , still `` fresh '' enough to fancy that '' kindness and indulgence '' have anything at all to do with the appearance of his writings in '' sterling periodicals , '' or that any publisher in the world would print his copy out of charitable motives ?

		If he does think so , we advise him earnestly to learn the ropes of his new calling with all possible speed , and we recommend Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	as a man from whom he can obtain some useful points in practical navigation .

		Perhaps , however , Mr.
Mul	PERSON	- len 's prefatory parade of humility is , as
A. Ward	PERSON	used to say , `` wrote sarkastikul '' ; and we hope it is .

		The book thus apologetically launched by Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	is , to our thinking , in several important par - ticulars , and perhaps we may say on the whole , the best one he has yet given us .

		The best chapters that is to say , the really descriptive and truth - telling chapters in the capital `` Cruise of the Cachalot '' are better , mainly because newer and more picturesque , than any of the chapters in '' The Log of a Sea - Waif . ''

		But the former book con - tained an objectionable element of melodrama and rather cheap sensationalism from which the latter is free . ''

		The Log of a Sea - Waif '' is strictly au - tobiographical , the plain narrative of the experiences of the first four years of the author 's life as a sailor in the British merchant service , and therefore in some sort a British counterpart of the
American of Shaketptart	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dana 's `` Two Years Before the Mast '' for , it is perhaps needless to say , Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	began at the bottom rung or , rather , ratline of the maritime ladder ; namely , as cabin-boy .

		His first ship was the '' Arabella , '' bound for Demarara , a leaky old '' hooker '' -LRB- heavily insured , probably , by her thrifty owners -RRB- commanded by a skipper whone good-will toward Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	took the painful form of beating nautical wisdom into his head with belay ing-pins , and seasoning his young '' hide '' against the stripes of fortune with rope 's - ends , on the plan so splen - didly vindicated in the person of the immortal Bunsby .

		Subsequent voyages took Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	to
Havana	LOCATION	, to
Jamaica	LOCATION	, back to
London	LOCATION	and Liver - pool , to
Bombay	LOCATION	, to
Rangoon	LOCATION	, to
Melbourne	LOCATION	, etc. .

		The regular routine of the British merchant sailor 's life is graphically and faithfully depicted , in good , plain English , and with a sufficient spice of wholly believable yet sufficiently stirring adventure , afloat and ashore .

		In short , Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	's book is just the sort of one we hoped he would write ; and we trust that his '' So long ! ''

		at its close implies that it will be continued .

		There are eight illustrations .

		It will hardly be expected that we shall do complete justice to a new book on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Sonnets in a single short notice .

		We shall try to indicate one point only concerning Mr.
Jesse Johnson	PERSON	's ''
Testi	PERSON	- mony of the Shakespearean Sonnets '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- which has hitherto prevented our accepting the the - ory presented in it .

		We think it necessary for any theory which would replace an accepted idea that it shall have less difficulty in the way of belief than the view it seeks to displace .

		The ordinary view of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's sonnets presents some striking dif - ficulties , and Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	calls our attention to some difficulties with which we have not been fa - miliar possible inconsistencies , internal and ex - ternal .

		But though such matters may make it harder to hold to our former conviction , they seem to us to pale in difficulty before the state of things which Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	imagines in their stead .

		If Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	be right , we must conceive a great poet writing plays and poems and giving them to the world under the name of somebody else of Will - iam Shakespeare with such perfect self-abnegation that no whisper of the real state of things reached the world .

		This is something quite inconsistent with our usual idea of a poet ; something that has not been known to happen since the world began .

		The case of Homer -LRB- if he were not the author of the Homeric poems -RRB- is not an analogy , nor the case of
Chatterton	LOCATION	, nor of
Macpherson	ORGANIZATION	.

		nor of
Ireland	LOCATION	, nor of the letters of
Junius	PERSON	, nor of Pope 's Odyssey , nor of the Portuguese Sonnets , nor even the theory of the Baconian authorship .

		The only similar case we think of , and that in a minor way , is that of
Sidney Carton	PERSON	in `` A Tale of Two Cities . ''

		The idea has not the confirmation of analogy ; and be - ing on its face improbable , it offers a great difficulty to the sober-minded .

		That is no reason , however ,
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 367 why it should not be held if necessary .

		But the only reason that it should be necessary to try to hold this difficult opinion is the difficulty of believing certain other matters of poetic psychology ; as , for instance , that the poet should call himself much older than his friend when really only nine years older -LRB- p. 37 -RRB- ; that he should sometimes have thought of himself as old , past his prime , something of a failure , when only thirty or thirty-five years old -LRB- pp. 38-43 -RRB- ; that , being of the temper we should infer from external evidence , he should ap - pear in his lyric poetry to be anxious , downcast , timid -LRB- p. 60 -RRB- ; that he should have written these sonnets to the
Earl of Southampton	ORGANIZATION	without any allusion to the brilliant circumstances of the latter 's life -LRB- p. 80 -RRB- .

		These points , and others , do not seem so very difficult to us ; but whatever difficulty they have in Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	's mind is of the same kind as the difficulty in our mind -LRB- and we should say in the mind of anyone else -RRB- , attending the conception of a great unknown poet who allowed
William Shakespeare	PERSON	to appropriate as his own the most re - markable works of literature .

		In other words , Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	would do away with the usual conception by means which , if applied to his own idea , would sweep it forever from the memory even of mankind .

		Such and such things , he believes , could not have readily happened -LRB- although a true knowledge of almost any poet 's mind would probably reveal a hundred parallel cases -RRB- , and therefore he prefers to believe something so unheard of that if it had been the case it would be the only thing of its kind in the history of the world .

		This explanation of a difficult matter is far more difficult to conceive than the original difficulty itself .

		Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	offers evidence which he says '' would authorize a judg - ment in a court of a law . ''

		He may be right ; but we hardly think it would stand a severe examina - tion in a class in logic .

		Mr.
Joel Benton	PERSON	's '' In the
Poe Cir	ORGANIZATION	- SySSyi , < ** '' -LRB-
Mansfield	ORGANIZATION	and
Wessels	PERSON	-RRB- is an attractively illustrated book made up of five essays which have appeared before in the magazines .

		It is a non-committal sort of book .

		The name does not commit the author to any espe - cial content , nor does the content commit him to any definite opinion .

		This point is rather note - worthy , because the book is chiefly a discussion of the relation of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's poetry to that of Dr.
T. H. Chivers	PERSON	.

		Concerning Dr.
Chivers	PERSON	, Mr.
Benton	PERSON	has found and put together a good deal of interesting information , but he does not seem to have formed any definite opinion as to whether
Poe	PERSON	or
Chivers	PERSON	was the original of an element common to the work of both .

		This we rather regret .

		We think the fol - lowing lines in '' The Vigil of Aiden '' very like some in '' The Raven '' : '' And that modest mild sweet maiden , In the
Rosy Bowers	ORGANIZATION	of .

		Aiden , With her lily-lips love-laden , Answered , ' Yes !

		f orevermore ! ' ''

		In fact , they are so like that it seems clear to us that one of the poets copied from the other . ''

		The Raven '' was published in
1845	DATE	; the volume by
Chivers	PERSON	containing these lines was published in
1851	DATE	.

		Why present such a case , why speak of Chivers as a '' precursor '' of
Poe	PERSON	, unless some ad - ditional matters can be alleged ?

		It will hardly be believed that Mr.
Benton	PERSON	has nothing more to offer on this point .

		He has not : he merely quotes from the volume of
Chivers	ORGANIZATION	, published in
1851	DATE	after
Poe	PERSON	's death , and contents himself with suggesting vaguely that the poems may have been published previously in magazines , and that
Poe	PERSON	may have seen them and so been inspired by
Chivers	PERSON	.

		We note one passage only , although the case is much the same with many more .

		But on the facts presented by Mr.
Benton	PERSON	, the inference is that in this one case
Chivers	PERSON	copied
Poe	PERSON	, and thus was a plagiarist , not a '' precursor . ''

		And if he copied here , it adds to the probability -LRB- in the absence of direct evidence -RRB- that he did so in more doubtful cases .

		Mr.
Benton	PERSON	, then , suggests that
Poe	PERSON	was a plagiarist on grounds which show -LRB- unless something more be adduced -RRB- that he was plagiarized from .

		This is not a good thing to do .

		We might not care to hold a brief for
Poe	PERSON	, but we do believe that to accuse him or anyone else of plagiarism , even by insinuation , on such absurd grounds as we have here , is , to say the least , unfor - tunate .

		If the charge is to be made , it should be definite and have at least some basis in fact : mere possibilities and vague suggestions should not be hurried into the magazines and then put between covers .

		Besides his view of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's relation to Chiv - ers , Mr.
Benton	PERSON	has an idea on Baudelaire 's rela - tion to
Poe	PERSON	, of which some conception may be gained from his notion that in '' Les Fleurs du Mai '' Baudelaire '' claimed to show that evil was not wholly without its better side , and that good is in some mysterious manner related to the whole scheme of things . ''

		Such was not our idea of the work in question , and we turned to it to see how the matter stood .

		But we have not been here won over to Mr.
Benton	PERSON	's view , any more than in the case of
Chivers	ORGANIZATION	.

		We have dawdled a good deal over Mr.
C. F. Nirdlinger	PERSON	's `` Masques and Mummers '' -LRB- De
Witt	PERSON	-RRB- , which came out in the early
summer	DATE	, but on the whole it seems a bit more appropriate to speak of a book on the theatre at a time when one is going to the theatre than when one is not .

		We have already spoken in favor of books of collected theatrical criticism : we think that in itself the practice tends to give a better character to the current reporting of the doings on the stage .

		Now and then the criticism has rather lost its point because we can - not remember the things criticized , but this is not always so : in many cases the views expressed are in themselves as valuable as any other collected criticism .

		As may be surmised from his title , Mr.
Nirdlinger	PERSON	is not an out-and-out admirer of the ac - tor 's profession as such : he likes the drama , but the worship of the actor is not to his mind .

		His Eisayt on the theatre .

		THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, views are certainly advanced , but we do not know that he goes farther than an intimate knowledge of the facts would naturally encourage if not warrant .

		We rather like some of his ideas as that actors should be anonymous , that there is no art of acting , that praise is not the whole and necessary duty of the critic .

		Despite some natural exaggeration , we imagine that much truth will here be found .

		When it comes to matters of the drama , we are sometimes inclined to differ with our author : we do not see that he shows a very keen sense of discrimination .

		In a large way , he is always right .

		It is right to see beauty in the romance of '' Cyrano '' and '' The Prisoner of Zenda , '' and ugliness in the hypocrisy of Zaza '' and The Christian . ''

		But we do not think that Mr.
Nirdlinger	PERSON	is right in supposing that `` truth though the heavens fall '' is the art-shibboleth of Mr.
Henry Arthur Jones	PERSON	; nor , though we con - sider Mr.
Pinero	PERSON	artistically honest -LRB- as far as he goes -RRB- , do we consider him a man of keen vision or depth of thought Both are clever men for plays that will catch the attention of the educated theatre - goer , and neither is much more .

		We do not our - selves think that
Seilor Echegaray	PERSON	goes very far beyond them .

		And when we speak of a lack of discrimination in Mr.
Nirdlinger	PERSON	, it is because his essays do not bring out any greater qualities in
Herr Hauptmann	PERSON	or
M. Rostand	PERSON	than he perceives in the writers just mentioned .

		Still , it must be re - membered that these essays were not always written with a view to each other .

		Remarks which in view of any given play seemed quite clear , may easily seem a little out of focus when compared with something else .

		Mr.
Nirdlinger	PERSON	's voice seems to us rather strident at times , a little affected at others ; but his book has life enough to carry off many more drawbacks than those we have lightly touched upon , and many theatre-goers will be glad to see it .

		Those who recall the pleasant chatty reminiscences of Mr.
Felix Mos	PERSON	- an < t mutida * .

		c heles which told an interested world of his youth with the late
George Du Maurier	PERSON	, will find the same sort of entertainment in the later work , '' Fragments of an Autobiography '' -LRB- Harper -RRB- .

		A painter by profession , and more particularly a painter of portraits , Mr.
Moscheles	PERSON	has made him - self known and admired in
England	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	, and
France	LOCATION	, as well as in
America	LOCATION	.

		The son of an em - inent composer and godson of
Felix Mendelssohn	PERSON	, the sketch of his career is a frank and charming view of artistic life at its best .

		With his music , his painting , and his earnest endeavors to move the world along tbe paths of peace , Mr.
Moscheles	PERSON	is alike a subject for approval and emulation .

		The best view he gives of himself in his writings is not in but between the lines , where the man of the world , but still the man of enthusiasms and simple pleasures , speaks to his friend the reader .

		To Americans , not the least interesting of his reminis - cences will be the conversations he had with Mr.
Grover Cleveland	PERSON	, just after the first election to the Tke mi ' of the Boer * atflnl-hand .

		presidency .

		The painter takes no little credit to himself for suggesting to Mr.
Cleveland	PERSON	his ideas of arbitration at that time , and holds , with appar - ently good reason , that the arbitration treaty with
Great Britain	LOCATION	, the failure of which with only too many other failures lies at the door of the Amer - ican
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, was derived primarily from his sug - gestion at that time .

		To have been everywhere , to have seen everything , and to have known everyone , are prime requisites for writing an interesting book , if the writer be not unduly puffed up thereby .

		From this fault Mr.
Moscheles	PERSON	is reasonably free , and we feel , after reading his Fragments '' for the second time , that it is rather the celebrities who are under obligation to Mr.
Moscheles	PERSON	than Mr.
Mos	PERSON	- cheles who is under obligation to the celebrities .

		The value of the book is enhanced by portraits of several of the persons discussed ,
Browning	PERSON	and
Mazzini	PERSON	with others , reproduced from his own paint - ings ; but we miss a picture of the autobiographer .

		Almost the first information the people of the
United States	LOCATION	have received from the
Transvaal	LOCATION	Re - public at first-hand comes in the pages of ''
Oom Paul	PERSON	's People '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , the result of a journey through
South Africa	LOCATION	made by Mr.
Howard C. Hillegas	PERSON	of
New York	LOCATION	.

		For the first and almost tbe only time recently , the
Boers	PERSON	are permitted to speak for themselves , instead of having their con - ceptions , ideals , ambitions , and practices misinter - preted by their enemies .

		The difference is striking .

		In habits , religions , and ideal .

		* , a strong similarity can be traced between the
Boers	PERSON	and the
New England	LOCATION	colonies .

		The one book with which every citizen of the
Transvaal	LOCATION	is familiar is the
Bible	LOCATION	.

		His quotations from it , wrested into cant and hypocrisy in the same manner that the utter - ances of the Puritans were , are not only natural but inevitable , and the use of Scripture is no more done for effect than it was in Governor
Sewall	PERSON	's Diary .

		It is the
United States	LOCATION	which affords Krue - ger and his advisers the ideals of government they hope to make their own , and they are sufficiently skilled historically to find a
Paul Revere	PERSON	and a
Boston Massacre	ORGANIZATION	in their own history .

		The Amer - icans resident in
South Africa	LOCATION	, with the exception of those wholly dependent upon the British mine - owners there , are uniformly with the
Boers	ORGANIZATION	in their struggle , Mr.
Hillegas	PERSON	says ; and the educational affairs of the Republic are largely in American hands .

		The Kimberley diamond mines , wrested from the
Orange Free State	ORGANIZATION	with a forced payment of
$ 450,000	MONEY	, have yielded
$ 400,000,000	MONEY	already .

		All the trouble over the
Witwatersrandt	LOCATION	is stated to be the result of
Krueger	PERSON	's attempt to obtain for his own country a larger share of the mining profits .

		Significantly , much of the money has gone for the purchase of arms and the erection of fortifications .

		The book should be studied by everyone interested in the bloody and deplorable drama now being en - acted in
South Africa	LOCATION	.

		THE DIAL 369 An advanced Manv admirers of Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	's text-book in `` American Commonwealth '' have civil government .

		w -RCB- 8 h e d that the work might be used as the standard text for instruction in our second - ary schools .

		To make such use practicable , the American publishers -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- some time ago prepared an abridged edition , and this they have now supplemented by publishing a volume called '' Outlines of Civics , '' to be used in connection with the work of Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	.

		This new volume is the work of Mr.
Frederick H. Clark	PERSON	, and the only drawback to its general introduction into our schools is found in the fact that it is written with special reference to the institutions of a single
State California	LOCATION	.

		Other States would need to supple - ment it still further by special local material .

		The work is extremely well done .

		It provides lists of topics and works of reference , suggestive questions for investigation , and all the other apparatus needed for successful school work .

		It has , moreover , an introduction by Dr.
George E. Howard	PERSON	, which puts things so admirably that we must find room for an extract .

		`` In history , especially , the text - book maker and the teacher have usually aimed quite too low .

		In the attempt to simplify , they have written down or stooped to the supposed capacity of the pupil .

		Instead of putting the youth 's facul - ties under a healthy strain , instead of lifting his thought to the highest possible level of attainment , the subject has been deliberately rendered juiceless and devoid of living interest , even when not made utterly distasteful .

		If this be a grave mistake in the historical field generally , it is positively inex - cusable in civics and civil government . ''

		We wish that these words might have the salutary effect of driving forever out of our schools the text-books still used in three-fourths of them .

		When such works as those of Messrs.
Bryce	PERSON	,
Fiske	PERSON	, and Hins - dale are to be had , it is positively criminal to use books of the discredited old-fashioned sort .

		Abraham Lincoln Mr -
Cari Schurz	PERSON	, in an essay which as a Man of is a classic , pictures Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	as the People .

		a man u wno > preserving his homely speech and rustic manner even in the most con - spicuous position of that period , drew upon himself the scoffs of polite society , and then thrilled the soul of mankind with utterances of wonderful beauty and grandeur . ''

		The contrasts in this great life have often been noted , and people have wondered how this man of heroic mould could , for example , have opened the most serious discussion with the recounting of some story from the lower walks of life .

		In ''
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	, the Man of the Peo - ple '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr.
Norman Hapgood	PERSON	attempts to show how the common people furnished the in - spiration for a remarkable career .

		The familiar details of Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	's life are told again with many an anecdote here and there as the hero used them to illustrate his meaning .

		There is no claim to the discovery of any new material , but whatever of merit the book has rests on the underlying idea expressed in the title .

		In these days of iconoclasm , the Cromwellian theory of exact representation may be a desirable one ; but there are two ways of look - ing at a monument .

		The one who seeks ugly black spots under the shining surface may find them ; but such an observer would never realize the sig - nificance of the Bunker Hill shaft .

		In one sense Mr.
Hapgood	PERSON	's idea of President
Lincoln	PERSON	's life is attractive .

		The `` homely speech and rustic man - ner '' certainly were marked in the man who rose from the ranks of the common people , but no story of his life will be accepted by the average American as satisfactory , which does not emphasize most strongly the higher and grander elements of char - acter which make him belong to the ages .

		There is serious question whether this particular volume , read by young or old , will leave just the right im - pression of
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	.

		The literary
Ifc	ORGANIZATION	is a gratifying evidence of healthy study of '' interest in Biblical study , that Pro- the
Bible	LOCATION	.

		fessor
Moulton	PERSON	's '' Literary Study of the Bible '' -LRB-
D. C. Heath & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- should pass into a new edition .

		The '' Modern Reader 's Bible '' has made some of the original treatise unnecessary , but the new edition still prints enough of the author 's arrangement of the Biblical literature to illustrate his positions .

		As a means of awakening interest in the ancient literature of the Jews , '' literary study '' has a legitimate rdle to play ; but its chief value lies in its insistence upon the literary rather than the dogmatic point of view .

		Probably few specialists in the Old Testament would quite agree with all of Professor
Moulton	PERSON	's arrangements , and the present understanding of Hebrew poetry is hardly sufficient to warrant any hard-and-fast decisions as to the correctness of many of his views as to strophes , anti-strophes , quatrains , and other forms .

		But his insistance that the literary character of a piece of scripture shall be determined before one interprets it , is certainly to be commended ; and it is here that the exegete will get help .

		What could be more astonishing or maddening than the assurance with which systematic theologians have made poetry do the work of philosophy , and rhapsody furnish premises for metaphysics !

		The influence of Pro- fessor
Moulton	PERSON	's book in counteracting such un - scientific methods is already great , and in its recon - structed form will doubtless be greater .

		Amateur and oratory .

		Books on rhetoric and English com - position , on debating , or extempo - raneous speaking , are apt to be of one sort or another : either too systematic and dry , or interesting enough but indefinite and desultory .

		The latter , so far as we have observed , is more commonly the case with books on public speaking ; and it is possible that the objection may be alleged against Dr.
J. M. Buckley	PERSON	's `` Extemporaneous Oratory for Professional and Amateur Speakers '' -LRB-
Eaton & Mains	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		We do not feel sure that the book will provide a method definite enough to be 370 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, in thing easily pat in practice by a private student or by a class .

		But this ia a matter on which we can not pass judgment by reading alone .

		On the other side , the book is excellent ; it is not only entertaining , but it also has the good quality of arousing real interest : in reading it , one is constantly filled with a desire to begin and make speeches at once , just to try .

		Dr.
Buckley	PERSON	has had long experience of extempore speaking ; we are not sure that he has had practice at individual teaching , but he has heard an immense amount of good speaking , and has trained himself with great care .

		His funda - mental ideas are sensible .

		It is true that they appear also to be rather hard to carry out , or , more exactly , rather easy not to carry oat rightly ; but the advantageous thing about the book is that the author is very full and quite practical in his sug - gestions as to .

		how his principles may be put in practice .

		Dr.
Buckley	PERSON	's idea of extemporaneous peaking is speaking where the idea takes verbal form at the moment of utterance .

		His book will go far toward showing how one can actually speak in this way so as to express oneself and hold the attention of others .

		In his latest book , '' Fables in Slang '' -LRB-
H. S. Stone & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr.
George Ade	PERSON	leaves the implications of his former character-studies and indulges in social satire , some of it pathetically humorous , some of it bordering closely on coarseness and vulgarity , and all of it coming near to making the use of slang a fine , even a literary , art .

		With this read - able volume , in which certain ill-considered illus - trations heighten all the defects of the text and lessen all of its virtues , comes a second volume of the reflections of the philosopher of the ''
Archey Road	PERSON	, '' bearing the title of '' Mr.
Dooley	PERSON	in the Hearts of His Countrymen '' -LRB- Small ,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		A dedication to the English publishers re - producing the original book without authorization is in questionable taste ; and the closing chapter of the book , dealing with the
Dreyfus	ORGANIZATION	trial , seems to be written for an English rather than an American audience , differing from the rest of the papers not merely in form but in appealing to a standard of humor which is assuredly neither Irish nor Amer - ican .

		The rest of the book contains the same genial satire as the earlier volume , and has a hearty laugh on every page , as well as merited rebuke of many iniquities in the English-speaking world .

		But it is scarcely literature in any of the senses in which the ''
Bigelow	PERSON	Papers '' was , nor can it be said to be so intended .

		A well-written , entertaining book , and a foot-note of no small value to the history of the ill-starred and un - principled political enterprise it deals with , is Mrs.
Sara Yorke Stevenson	PERSON	's '' Maximilian in
Mexico	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		While the volume goes to some extent , and very intelligently , into the formal history of Napoleon the Little 's fatuous Mexican perform - ance the attempt of a commonplace statesman to work out a political conception in the grand style , and foredoomed to a more or less farcical anti- climax it consists primarily of the reminiscences of an eye-witness who was in
Mexico	LOCATION	during the period of the French occupation , and who moved familiarly in the exotic society that set up its court at the ancient capital .

		The author makes us ac - quainted with the principal actors in the drama , and paints a picture of its social side that is at once fresh , animated , and suggestive .

		The book is showily bound in the Mexican colors , and contains a num - ber of portraits , notably a curious group of the firing party that shot
Maximilian	PERSON	and
Miramon	PERSON	.

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		The Rev. Mr.
MacDougall	PERSON	's `` Conversion of the Maoris '' -LRB-
Presbyterian Board of Publication	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has its importance from what the author has to say about that other segment of our imperial domain ,
Samoa	LOCATION	.

		If any - thing can prove the unwisdom of entangling alliances with
Europe	LOCATION	, our experience here should do so ; while the author shows that all the recent disturbances in the islands have been due to the white man 's greed .

		And the natives always suffer , which is '' the white man 's burden '' divested of its poetry .

		An '' Auswahl aus Lutbers Deutschen Schriften '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- , edited by Dr.
W. H. Carruth	PERSON	, is an acceptable addition to the library of German texts available for college use .

		It includes a lengthy and important intro - duction , besides the usual body of notes .

		Dr.
Albert B.	PERSON	.

		Faust is the editor of a volume of ''
Heine	PERSON	's Prose '' -LRB-

		Dr.
Hermann Scboenfeld	PERSON	has edited
Schiller	PERSON	's '' Maria Stuart '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- for school use .

		Two other German text-books -LRB- Heath -RRB- are an '' Erstes Deutsches Lesebuch , '' by Mr.
Robert Nix	PERSON	; and an edition , abridged , we regret to say , of
Herr Suder	PERSON	- in .

		inn 's '' Der Katzensteg , '' edited by Dr.
Benjamin W. Wells	PERSON	.

		A little book by
John Barrett	PERSON	, former minister of the
United States	LOCATION	to
Siam	LOCATION	, is called Admiral
George Dewey	PERSON	'' -LRB- Harper -RRB- , and devotes itself to a sketch of that redoubtable warrior during his trying days of ser - vice in
Manila Bay	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Barrett	PERSON	was with him during a great part of this time , and his narrative is an intimate one , though not rising to any great dignity as such .

		The book will serve to gratify the demands for knowledge of those who do not read the daily papers , from whose columns its matter is largely taken .

		An even dozen of volumes in the charming '' Temple Classics '' series -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- have recently reached us .

		The titles include a two-volume edition of
Herrick	ORGANIZATION	's Hesperides , '' Vols .

		7 to 10 of the ten-volume edition of
Plutarch	ORGANIZATION	,
Thomas Lodge	PERSON	's translation of Seneca '' On Benefits , ''
Cavendish	PERSON	's Life of
Wolsey	LOCATION	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	's Sonnets ,
Basil Montagu	PERSON	's `` Thoughts of Divines and Philosophers , ''
Sterne	PERSON	's `` Sentimental Journey , '' and
Walton	PERSON	's `` Compleat Angler , '' the latter with notes by Mr.
Austin Dobson	PERSON	.

		The title of the volume is '' Invisible Links , '' and the translator is Miss

		The new ''
Haworth	PERSON	'' edition of the '' Life and Works of the Sisters
Bronte	PERSON	, '' to be completed in seven volumes , is begun with ''

		The Messrs.

		The publishers of the ''

Nov. 16	DATE	, sort thus far issued .

		Slavery occupies the most promi - nent place in this collection , being represented by a group of seven or eight documents .

		Early explorations and colonial settlements are also well represented , and the value of the whole mass of material presented is very great .

		The death of
John Codman Ropes	ORGANIZATION	on the
27th of October	DATE	, the news of which did not reach us in time for our last issue , must be at least mentioned now , because he was a valued contributor to THE DIAL in its earlier years , and because of his high rank among American historical scholars .

		Born in
1836	DATE	, he lived to be sixty - three yean of age .

		A lawyer by profession , he devoted a large part of bis later years to the study of military history , and produced several works of the highest value , including the '' Life of
Napoleon	PERSON	, '' The Battle of
Waterloo	LOCATION	, '' '' The
Army	ORGANIZATION	under Pope , '' and the '' His - tory of the Civil War , '' which is now left unfinished , since he was working upon the third volume at the time of his death .

		The `` Annotated Bibliography of
American History	ORGANIZATION	, '' to which Mr.
J. N. Lamed	PERSON	is seeking contributors , is a work that has been projected by Mr.
George	PERSON	lies , of
New York	LOCATION	, and that will be published under the aus - pices of the
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		In plan , the work will be on lines exemplified in Mr.
Iles	PERSON	's '' Annotated Bibliography of Fine Arts , '' published last year , with notes supplied by Mr.
Russell Sturgis	PERSON	and Mr.
Henry	PERSON	.


Krehbiel	PERSON	, and it will carry one step further into practice the admirable idea of an `` ap - praisal of literature '' which Mr. lies has been urging for several years .

		To realize the idea he has already expended both money and time , and is prepared to expend more .

		He assumes the whole cost of the un - dertaking , with no probability of a return sufficient to reimburse him .

		The scheme of the work is -LRB- 1 -RRB- the selection of 1,500 or 2,000 titles of the books which readers in American history need most to have valued for them , either in commendation or warning ; and -LRB- 2 -RRB- the preparation of a brief note to each title , such as will appraise the book with full knowledge , with sound judgment , and with absolute sincerity .

		As far as pos - sible , these notes will be signed by the writers ; but if , in any case , a more independent judgment can be obtained by omitting the signature , this may be done .

		The single object in view is to procure for the reading public authoritative estimates of books , frankly and fearlessly expressed .

		In no line of business has the evolution been so great as that of book-selling .

		From the old time-houored dingy shop , with its high shelves , has developed the modern book-shop with its glass oases , convenient ar - rangements , and abundance of light .

		From a very limited class of bookbuyers we have broadened out into an intelligent book-loving and book-reading nation , and to meet the wants of thousands of book-buyers , to whom a good book-shop is inaccessible , the system of Selling Books by Mail Has been established .

		438 OPERA IN
CHICAGO	LOCATION	.

		The annual season of grand opera in
Chi	LOCATION	- cago is now practically at an end , and the re - sult is a very distinct announcement on the part of Mr.
Maurice Grau	PERSON	that he will not re - turn another year unless a reasonable guaranty of financial support be provided .

		This an - nouncement is not made in a spirit of peevish - ness , but rather in a tone of genuine regret that
Chicago	LOCATION	should be no longer willing to give adequate support to an opera company whose efforts are based upon the highest stand - ard of artistic achievement .

		It is the logical consequence of the small attendance at the recent performances , coupled with the similar experience of the organization during the last three years .

		Clearly Mr.
Grau	PERSON	and his associ - ates can not be expected to produce opera in
Chicago	LOCATION	or any other city at a heavy yearly loss , and this is what they have been doing since
1895	DATE	.

		Up to that date , the weekly re - ceipts for several years had averaged some - thing like fifty thousand dollars ; during the
last four years	DATE	they have declined to something like thirty thousand dollars .

		In
New York	LOCATION	and
Boston	LOCATION	, Mr.
Grau	PERSON	informs us , the advance subscriptions alone for the coming season amount to more than this sum per week ; and in view of these facts , he is compelled to say that his philosophy , `` as far as
Chicago	LOCATION	is con - cerned , has reached the limit . ''

		No fair-minded person can quarrel with either this reasoning or its logical outcome .

		Such a company of singers as have been brought together for the present year is un - surpassed in the history of opera , and can not be paralleled anywhere in the world .

		Mr.
Grau	PERSON	hardly exceeds the bare truth when he says : `` If all the remaining singers in
Europe	LOCATION	were to be combined in one company , it would not equal in merit the company now appearing at the
Chicago Auditorium	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		There have been a few unfortunate substitutions in the casts of the works presented , but the performances as a whole have been of a degree of artistic excel - lence that is rarely attained in any city of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		This year , as well as for the five or six years preceding , Mr.
Grau	PERSON	has organized a company which has been capable of reaching 414 TIIK DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, what ten years ago was thought an impossible ideal , a company whose resources have been such as to make possible the production of Ger - man , French , and Italian works in the lan - guages in which they were written .

		We are no longer confined , as in years not very long past , to Italian opera , but have been given German opera and French opera instead of inartistic Italian translations of the French and German masterpieces .

		In
Chicago	LOCATION	, we have had , more - over , the services of the local orchestra that is , of such an orchestra as no other city in Amer - ica , and few others in
Europe	LOCATION	, can command for operatic purposes .

		And we have also a hall of unsurpassable acoustic qualities , and of such dimensions that it becomes possible to offer per - formances of the highest class at prices from one-half to two-thirds of those that obtain in nearly all other cities , large and small .

		But in spite of these manifest advantages , we have so neglected our opportunities that they now bid fair to be withdrawn altogether .

		The situation thus outlined is a curious one , and we do not wonder that Mr.
Grau	PERSON	is dis - heartened .

		The showing is discreditable for a city with metropolitan aspirations , a city big enough to display active jealousy of
New York	LOCATION	, and wealthy enough to support a three months ' rather than a three weeks ' season of opera .

		It is a situation too complex to be explained by any one formula , and sufficiently interesting to be worth some attempt at analysis .

		We have followed the history of opera in
Chicago	LOCATION	with fairly close attention for the past twenty - five years , and it may be worth while to set forth a few of the conclusions that have been forced upon us by this lengthy and varied ex - perience .

		The first consideration to which we would call attention is of a very petty nature , but we believe it to be a serious factor in the present problem .

		While it is true that
Chicago	LOCATION	gets opera at lower prices than any other city , it is also true that it possesses an opera house of such capacity as to make low prices advisable even from the strictly business point of view of the management .

		Now the traditional price of opera in
Chicago	LOCATION	, maintained for many years before the Auditorium became available , was three dollars .

		In only two or three special cases such as those of
Madame Lucca	LOCATION	and
Madame Patti	PERSON	was this price ever exceeded until about four years ago , when Mr.
Grau	PERSON	took the ill-advised step of adding
fifty cents	MONEY	to this sum .

		The decline of receipts began at that time , and has continued ever since .


Fifty cents	MONEY	is a small matter , but the very pettiness of the advance caused it to be resented , and we believe that it would have been wiser to forego it altogether , or even to make it a still larger amount .

		The problem is a familiar one to students of economics ; it is that of determin - ing the price at which profits will reach their maximum aggregate .

		It is something to be found out by experiment alone ; and Mr.
Grau	PERSON	's experiment has proved unfortunate .

		We do not doubt that he would have had larger re - ceipts every year had he adhered to the tradi - tional scale of prices , and we think it quite possible also that a considerably augmented scale of prices would have operated in the same way , although in this case with the accompan - iment of smaller audiences and conspicuously large vacant tracts in the body of the house .

		Another consideration is that opera of a sort and sometimes of a very good sort has of late been offered to the
Chicago	LOCATION	public upon increasingly frequent occasions at little more than ordinary theatre prices , and , dur - ing the past year , at even less than those prices .

		This must have had its effect upon an indiscriminating public , in which artistic appreciation is not developed to the point of realizing the vast difference between fine and ordinary performances .

		To a logical mind , the former is richly worth two or three times as much as the latter ; but the mind of the average opera-goer is not always logical .

		Then there have been many minor annoy - ances .

		Those have been disappointments in the case of individual singers of whose appearance there was a reasonable expectation , and disap - pointments in the case of substitutions of works and changes of bills concerning which the public has been left uninformed until the last possible moment .

		There have been now and then such artistic blots as the principal singers discoursing to one another in different languages an Italian Tannhauser with a Ger - man
Frau Venus	PERSON	, for example and usually a chorus singing Italian to the French of a Faust or the German of a
Lohengrin	LOCATION	.

		Works have often been given with essential parts omitted , and this without any warning to the public , as in the cases of '' Les Huguenots '' and ''
Guglielmo Tell	PERSON	. ''

		There has frequently been stage-management of the most slovenly sort ; the fire scene in Die Walkure '' has never been decently done in
Chicago	LOCATION	, the clos - ing scene in '' Tannhauser '' has been robbed of all its ethical effectiveness , and the final apo - theosis of '' Faust '' has been converted into a
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 415 grotesque anti-climax .

		In operas that include a ballet , there has been hardly an apology for that feature , and in the case of '' Faust '' the great
Walpurgis Night	ORGANIZATION	scene has been habitu - ally left out altogether .

		The stage sets have grown shabbier every year , and no attempt has been made to provide new ones .

		Finally , the boys who sell '' books of the opera '' have been permitted to cry their wares throughout the per - formance of the overture , although it might be the Vorspiel to '' Lohengrin '' or the introduc - tion to '' Tristan and Isolde , '' neither of which can be really heard unless the most absolute silence obtains .

		All these things taken together constitute a heavy indictment , and Mr.
Grau	PERSON	will do well to ponder upon them .

		They have shown a reck - less disregard of the minor details of art , which are to the sensitive mind almost as important as the leading features .

		They have resulted from the mistaken theory that opera is a thing for fashionable diversion and not a means of serious culture .

		They have combined with other influences to create a thoroughly unhealthy con - dition of affairs ; these things , and the vicious '' star '' system , and the meagreness of the re - pertoire presented from year to year , are ample to account for the f alling-off which is so greatly deplored .

		Concerning the limited repertoire of recent years , more than a word of comment is called for .

		The frequency with which such works as '' Martha '' and '' II Trovatore '' and '' Romeo et Juliette '' have been brought for - ward is an affront to the public intelligence .

		They are third-rate compositions , and it is de - plorable to waste upon them the resources of an organization which is capable of the highest achievements .

		It will not do to plead , as Mr.
Grau	PERSON	does , that his recent experiments in new works have resulted in empty houses .

		If he means such operas as those of Massenet , they deserved no better fate .

		But if he means such works as '' Falstaff '' and '' Otello , '' the public may be trusted to appreciate them in good time .

		Every manager ought to plan for the future , even at some present and temporary loss ; the great works will find hearers in the end , and in such numbers as to compensate for the loss that they may have occasioned in their earlier pres - entations .

		To give up , and fall back upon the old hackneyed favorites , merely because an un - familiar but meritorious composition does not at once command popular applause , is to save the present situation only at the cost of losing all control of the future .

		It is not only the new works that are neglected , but the acknowl - edged classics as well .

		Why do we so seldom hear '' Fidelio , '' and why do we almost never hear '' Orfeo '' or '' Die Zauberflote '' ?

		Among comparatively recent works , why does not '' Mefistofele '' stay in the current repertoire , why has '' La Gisconda '' been missing from it for many years , and why has Mr.
Reyer	PERSON	's '' Si - gurd '' never found a way into it ?

		The simple fact remains that the round of works that one gets a chance to hear becomes narrower all the time , and in this condition of affairs there is no hope for permanence of interest in one of the noblest forms of art .

		Fifteen and twenty years ago in
Chicago	LOCATION	, although no such companies and singers as those which now come to us were known , the seeker after operatic culture in this city was given the opportunity of hearing a far greater variety of works , in performances that were at least tolerable .

		If opera is to be saved from the condition of dry rot into which it is now rapidly falling , it must be done chiefly by a decided enlargement of repertoire , including the revival of many neglected classics , and by a far more conscientious attention to artistic de - tails than has recently obtained .

		COMMUNICA TION .

		GOOD LITERATURE FOR THE YOUNG .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		As the head of a large family , in whose interest 1 have been studying educational methods for twenty years past , may I say a word in commendation of your leading article in the current number of THE DIAL ?

		Although you have said it much better than I could have done , you have exactly expressed my feeling as to the great importance of familiarizing the young mind with the best literature , and training the memory by compelling its use in the highest degree .

		Modern edu - cators seemed to have overlooked the old truth that there is '' no royal road to learning . ''

		From the kinder - garten , through the primary school certainly , if no farther , everything is made as easy as possible for the child .

		He is expected to observe many things , and to learn very few .

		In place of the good old method of memorizing and analyzing masterpieces of the poets , he is coaxed and amused by pretty songs and games .

		There is something to be said , I suppose , for the new ways , for the children -LRB- naturally -RRB- like them ; but I can not think that true mental discipline can be acquired without hard work ; and it seems to me that any thinking man or woman who was educated under the system of thirty or forty years ago must be grateful for the steady grind which strengthened mind and memory alike , and which fostered a taste for the highest in literature which compelled the student to look up for his mental food rather than to find it on the level of his own untrained mind .

		STEVJENSON 'S LETTERS .

		* Those who enjoyed and that is to say all who read the series of
Stevenson	PERSON	letters in 44 Scribner 's Magazine '' will be glad to know that the comely volumes now before us are not a mere reprint of those pleasant epistles , but contain in addition to them nearly as many new ones of equal interest and quality .

		It is rather late in the day now to trumpet in a review
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	's gift as a let - ter writer .

		His place with the half-score or so of moderns who have excelled in this alleged lost art is already as secure as
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's , and it is no great venture in opinion to say that his letters the really Stevensonian ones , we mean , the ones that make us wonder the more at the miraculous fact that the writer of such whimsical , fantastical , delightfully non - sensical missives was a Scotchman are easily the best in their kind that have appeared in print since Lamb 's .

		If
Tusitala	LOCATION	carried in his mind 's eye any epistolary model at all , which is doubtful , that model was assuredly 44 Elia . ''


Stevenson	PERSON	, whe had a modest opinion of his own work in general -LRB- '' a great performer be - fore the Lord on the penny-whistle , '' he calls himself -RRB- , sincerely believed himself to be a dismal and constitutional failure as a corres - pondent .

		The content of his letters he forcibly styled '' rot '' ; and he thought his mind one 44 essentially and originally incapable of the art epistolary . ''

		It would be difficult , indeed , to specify , for the satisfaction of the unco-literal and serious-minded , just wherein lies the ele - ment of permanent and positive value in his letters , very much as it would be difficult to satisfy '' Mr.
Gradgrind	PERSON	'' as to the abiding merits of Lamb 's essay on roast pig .

		Their charm is a subtle essence , potent but elusive .

		As to form , they have none : It is their spe - cialty to have none .

		As to matter ,
Stevenson	PERSON	's own epithet rot '' has a certain applicability to not a few , and even to some of the most characteristic , of them to the following one to
James Payn	PERSON	, for instance , which 44 Elia '' himself might have written to
Manning	PERSON	.

Stevenson	PERSON	was a man of genius , and of a keen eye and a singularly independent mind , and the fact that he was so is flashed upon us often enough and brilliantly enough in his letters ; but their purely intellectual quality is by no means their dominant and characteristic qual - ity .

		We can not dispose of the collection by affixing to it the serviceable old labels , 44 freighted with wisdom '' and '' charged with sober reflection . ''

		Of deliberate speculation or theorizing upon the graver problems of life , there is hardly a trace .

		That
Stevenson	PERSON	, a thoughtful man , a man of imagination and keen sensibility , to whom for years death had been visibly beckoning , pondered much and pain - fully upon those problems , may be taken for granted .

		But whatever forebodings , whatever spiritual doubts and misgivings may have haunted him , he kept them to himself like a man , and did not transmit them through the mails to his friends .

		* As a correspondent , from this point of view , no stronger contrast to this sunny and gallant spirit can be sug - gested than his friend
John Addington Sy	PERSON	- monds , who wrote , as it might seem , with his coffin before him , who groaned and fretted over the hereafter through reams of sepulchral cor - respondence , and whose letters , however elo - quent , profound , and mournfully edifying they may be , are not seldom about as cheery and enlivening as the wail of a banshee .

		In one instance we find him admitting : '' I hate diffusing the scent of the charnel .

		I am doing it , however , in this letter . ''

		1899 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 417 As mere chronicles ,
Stevenson	PERSON	's letters are of no great value .

		`` I deny , '' he writes in one of them , `` that letters should contain news -LRB- I mean mine , other people 's should -RRB- '' ; and so , as a rule , he consistently refrained from pelting his cor - respondents with facts -LRB- '' sordid facts , '' he calls them -RRB- about himself and the world he moved in .

		As the excellent editor , Mr.
Colvin	PERSON	, re - marks , the letters are not at all of the sort that can be woven into the texture of a biographical narrative .

		Were we to attempt to divine the secret of their worth and charm , of the hold they now have , and will long continue to have , upon almost all classes of readers , we should say that it lies in their complete spontaneity , and in the resulting fact that they place us closely en rapport with one of the rarest and most captivating personalities that ever graced the profession of letters .

		They reflect as a mirror the mood of the moment , the passing whim , the fleeting humor of this mutable , kindly spirit , '' most fantastic but most human . ''

		Mr.
Colvin	PERSON	assures us that the letters at their best '' come nearer than anything else to the full - blooded charm and variety of
Stevenson	PERSON	's con - versation . ''

		Of that conversation Mr.
Henley	PERSON	has written : * `` I leave his praise in this direction -LRB- the telling of Scottish vernacular stories -RRB- to others .

		It is more to my purpose to note that he will discourse with you of morals , music , marbles , men , manners , metaphysics , medicine , mangold-wurzel que scays-je f with equal insight into essentials and equal pregnancy and felicity of utterance ; and that he will stop with you to make mud pies in the first gutter , range in your company whatever heights of thought and feeling you have found accessible , and end by guiding you to altitudes far nearer the stars than you have ever dreamed of footing it ; and that at the last he makes you wonder which to admire the more his easy familiarity with the Eternal
Veraci	PERSON	- ties or the brilliant flashes of imbecility with which his excursions into the infinite are sometimes diversified .

		He radiates talk , as the sun does light and heat ; and after an evening or a week with him , you come forth with a sense of satisfaction in your own capacity which somehow proves superior even to the inevitable conclusion that your brilliance was but the reflection of his own , and that all the while you were only playing the part of
Rubinstein	PERSON	's piano to
Sarasate	PERSON	's violin . ''

		Let us add to this somewhat extravagant flight of Mr.
Henley	PERSON	's an observation of Mr.
Colvin	PERSON	's on a certain eccentric side of
Steven	PERSON	- son 's character which peeps out occasionally , in a rather startling way , in the letters : '' There was yet another and very different side to
Stevenson	PERSON	which struck others more than it struck my - self , namely , that of the perfectly freakish , not perfectly human , irresponsible madcap or jester which sometimes appeared in him .

		It is true that his demoniac quick - * In an unpublished sketch cited by Mr.
Colvin	PERSON	.

		ness of wit and intelligence suggested occasionally a ` spirit of air and fire ' rather than one of earth ; that he was abundantly given to all kinds of quirk and laugh - ter ; and that there was no jest -LRB- saving the unkind -RRB- he would not make and relish .

		In the streets of Edin - burgh he had certainly been known for queer pranks and mystifications in youth ; and up to middle life there seemed to some of his friends to be much , if not of the
Puck	LOCATION	, at least of the
Ariel	LOCATION	, about him . ''

		It is good to know that the closing years of
Stevenson	PERSON	, the years of exile and daily battle with disease , were at least free from the stress of pecuniary strait and anxiety .

		His share in the proceeds of the sale of his writings was a just and even a handsome one .

		In this connection it is pleasant to quote a passage from a letter to Mr.
Archer	PERSON	-LRB-
October , 1887	DATE	-RRB- , which makes agreeable reading in more ways than one : '' I am now a salaried party ; I am a bourgeois now ; I am to write a weekly paper for
Scribner	ORGANIZATION	's , at a scale of payment which makes my teeth ache for shame and diffidence .

		The editor is , I believe , to apply to you ; for we were talking over likely men , and when I in - stanced you , he said he had had his eye upon you from the first .

		It is worth while , perhaps , to get in tow with the
Scribners	ORGANIZATION	; they are such thorough gentlefolk in all ways that it is always a pleasure to deal with them .

		I am like to be a millionaire if this goes on , and be pub - licly hanged at the social revolution : well , I would prefer that to dying in my bed ; and it would be a godsend to my biographer , if ever I have one . ''

		Mr.
Colvin	PERSON	's editing is all that can be de - sired painstaking , helpful , and unobtrusive ; and his Introductory is a delightful piece of work , from which we shall allow ourselves one more quotation , a sketch of
Stevenson	PERSON	's outer man . ''

		All this the reader should imagine as helped by the most speaking of presences : a steady , penetrating fire in the wide-set eyes , a compelling power and sweet - ness in the smile ; courteous , waving gestures of the arms and long , nervous hands , a lit cigarette generally held between the fingers ; continual rapid shif tings and pacings to and fro as he conversed : rapid , but not flur - ried nor awkward , for there was a grace in his attenu - ated but well-carried figure , and his movements were light , deft , and full of
spring	DATE	.

		When I first knew him he was passing through a period of neatness between two of Bohemian carelessness as to dress ; so that the effect of his charm was immediate .

		At other times of his youth there was something for strangers , and even for friends , to get over in the odd garments which it was his whim to wear the badge , as they always seemed to me , partly of a genuine carelessness , cer - tainly of a genuine lack of cash -LRB- the little he had was always absolutely at the disposal of his friends -RRB- , partly of a deliberate detachment from any particular social class or caste , partly of his love of pickles and adven - tures , which he thought befell a man thus attired more readily than another .

		But this slender , slovenly , non - descript apparition , long-visaged and long-haired , had only to speak in order to be recognized in the first minute for a witty and charming gentleman , and within the first five for a master spirit and man of genius . ''

		418 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, One interesting , and we think decidedly re - grettable , fact that appears in Mr.
Colvin	PERSON	's Introduction must be noted in closing .

		Lack of the needful leisure has compelled him to abandon the idea of preparing the separate vol - ume of biography which was to complete his literary memorial to his friend .

		The book is now , we learn , at the wish of
Stevenson	PERSON	's fam - ily , to be undertaken by his cousin , Mr.
Gra	PERSON	- ham Balfour .

		The volumes are manufactured in a style befitting their delightful content .

		E. o. J. FROM ACCAWMACKE TO
APPOMATTOX	LOCATION	.

		* The literature of
Virginia	LOCATION	has been much enriched during recent years .

		The delightful story by Mr.
John Fiske	PERSON	of '' Old
Virginia	LOCATION	and her Neighbors , '' and the more technical but equally valuable study by Mr.
Philip Alexander Bruce	PERSON	of the '' Economic History of
Virginia	LOCATION	in the
Seventeenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, '' together with the charming romances from the pen of Mrs.
Maud Wilder Goodwin	PERSON	, have prepared all interested in American history to welcome the two vol - umes which have been given to the press under the editorial supervision of Mr.
John S. Wise	PERSON	.

		The one is an autobiographical sketch , rich in illustration of the life and times '' before the war '' ; the other , a more dignified and stately account of the career of a former governor of
Virginia	LOCATION	, whose lot it was to send the soul of old
John Brown	PERSON	'' marching on . '' ''

		The End of an Era '' is a book full of life , the well-written story of the development of a wide-awake boy , who asks questions , who won - ders about many things , and who has the un - common fortune to come close to great leaders of thought and action in a most critical period in the history of his country .

		Seeing things as a boy or as a growing youth , the skill in nar - ration is such that , even as a man past fifty years of age , Mr.
Wise	PERSON	preserves in a remark - able way the boyish element which is absolutely essential to the correct recounting of the details of his life , from his childhood in
Accomack	LOCATION	, until , still several years from his majority , the era ended , the former things passed away , and everything was made new after
Appomattox	LOCATION	.

		It is this particular feature that gives charm to the book ; and it is not to be wondered at .

New York	LOCATION	:

		therefore , that the interest lags somewhat after the boy has become man enough to join the
Confederate Reserves	ORGANIZATION	, that aggregation of old men and striplings which
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	per - haps had in mind when he said that the Con - federacy was robbing the cradle and the grave '' to fill up its armies .

		The ancestral home of the Wise family was in
John Smith	PERSON	's '' Kingdom of Accawmacke , '' in the eastern peninsula of
Virginia	LOCATION	, a place long without railroad or telegraph or any such device of modern industrial life , and , despite the introduction of these conveniences of present-day civilization , a place where old cus - toms remain unchanged , and where to-day representatives remain of the very families that inhabited the region when
Charles	PERSON	the First was king , and gave the name of '' Old Domin - ion '' to the colony which did not like Crom - well but offered a crown and a kingdom to the unfortunate Stuarts .

		Even Mr.
Thomas Nelson Page	PERSON	, in his sketches of life in '' The Old South , '' has not surpassed Mr.
Wise	PERSON	in hia account of days and deeds in this quaint county of
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		But fortune did not keep the family of
Henry A. Wise	ORGANIZATION	always in
Accomack	LOCATION	.

		After an ex - citing canvass of the state in the Know-Nothing campaign , the father was elected governor , and removed to
Richmond	LOCATION	.

		Here new scenes aroused the inquisitive interest of the son ; and when , later , he was put out of danger of war 's mis - haps by sequestration in the mountains of the western part of the state , and , still later , was sent to the
Virginia Military Institute	ORGANIZATION	for hi * education , it was his peculiar experience while yet in the formative days of youth to gain a knowledge of the great variations in the climate , soil , and products of
Virginia	LOCATION	, and to come into close contact with representatives of the differ - ing elements of population , ranging in wide extremes from the gay cavaliers of the
Eastern Shore	ORGANIZATION	to the sturdy Scotch-Irishmen of Pres - byterian
Lexington	LOCATION	.

		No contrast could be more striking than the description of the reception tendered by his neighbors in Accomack to
Henry A. Wise	PERSON	on his return from service as minister to
Brazil	LOCATION	, where mirth and jollity and good fellowship abounded , and , at the other extreme , the account of life in
Lexington	LOCATION	where the Presbyterian church looked cold as a dog ' a nose , and where '' an evening spent among them is like sitting upon uvW ^ s cracking hailstones with one 's teeth . ''

		The sidelights thrown upon the social and political life of the time give value to the vol -
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 419 ume .

		The method of election is thus described : '' In due course came election day .

		Father being absent , the young cousin above referred to represented him at the polling place , and took me with him .

		In those days voting was done openly , or viva voce as it was called , and not by ballot .

		The election judges , who were magistrates , sat upon a bench with their clerks before them .

		Where practicable , it was customary for the candidate to be present in person and to occupy a seat at the side of the judges .

		As a voter appeared his name was called out in a loud voice .

		The judges inquired , '
John Jones	PERSON	-LRB- or
Bill Smith	PERSON	-RRB- for whom do you vote ' for governor , or whatever was the office to be filled .

		He replied by proclaiming the name of his favorite .

		Then the clerks enrolled the vote , and the judges announced it as enrolled .

		The representative of the candidate for whom he voted arose , bowed , and thanked him aloud ; and his partisans often applauded . ''

		The pen pictures of prominent men are always striking , and sometimes are exception - ally good .

		An example is the description of
General Winfield Scott	ORGANIZATION	: `` And Old Fuss and Feathers !

		Bless his colossal old soul !

		was ever a name more appropriately bestowed ?

		What a monster in size he was !

		Never was uniform more magnificent ; never were feathers in cocked hat more profuse ; never was sash so broad and gorgeous .

		He was old and gouty , keen for food , quick for drink , and thunderous of voice , large as a strawstack and red as a boiled lobster .

		His talk was like the roaring of a lion , his walk like the tread of an elephant .

		No turkey gobbler ever strutted or gobbled with more self - importance than did the hero of
Lundy	ORGANIZATION	's Lane . ''

		Everywhere in the book there are suggestive paragraphs .

		The youth sees a production of '' Uncle Tom 's Cabin '' on a
Philadelphia	LOCATION	stage .

		There are elements in the slave business , as set forth in the play , which are unknown to him .

		He has bitter thoughts ; he denies the justness of the representation .

		Then a desire comes over him to see a slave auction .

		One visit is enough , and he goes away in disgust and with longings for the removal of the evils of the system .

		The
John Brown	PERSON	raid makes a special impression upon him , because of his father 's official connection with the case .

		The attitude of the North is not liked by Vir - ginia , and the fact appears , from the Southern point of view , that there is an '' irrepressible conflict '' coming .

		When the war breaks out , the effect of the exposure of camp and battle is strikingly indicated , as a crack regiment once gay with splendid equipments reappears after a period of service .

		The subdued home-life is described , where men are absent , where the death of some member of the family brings profound grief and makes the women suffer untold agonies , as with fearful hearts they keep waiting for the war to cease . ''

		Every arms-bearing Tayloe , son , brother , husband , was in the forefront , save one .

		He had already fallen ; his portrait hung in the spacious drawing-room beside the others .

		His name was spoken and spoken again with gentle tears , and with that reverence which the devout render to the Christian martyr ... Who can picture the desolating sorrow which engulfed them , as one by one the strong arms on which that household depended fell helpless , and the news came home that the brave hearts for whose safety they prayed had ceased to beat !

		for it was so .

		The war filled grave after grave in the graveyard of the Tayloe family , until , when it ended , the male line was almost extinct . ''

		Such pictures as these show how the Confed - eracy exhausted every resource before , driven from
Richmond	LOCATION	, its army was forced to sur - render at
Appomattox	LOCATION	.

		The three quotations on varied themes give some idea of the style of the author of a very readable and very sugges - tive volume .

		The more sober and dignified style employed by the grandson of
Henry A. Wise	PERSON	in writing his biographical study makes his volume a de - sirable companion for the one just described .

		Naturally enough , the two narratives cross paths in many places , and when they are ex - amined in conjunction there is basis for the suspicion that the preparation for publication of the '' Life '' of his father after the death of its author may have suggested to Mr.
John S. Wise	PERSON	the idea of '' The End of an Era , '' many things in the latter book admirably supple - menting the chapters of the former .

		Governor Wise had many experiences dur - ing his seventy years of life .

		As Member of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, Minister to
Brazil	LOCATION	, member of sev - eral important conventions , state and national , Governor of
Virginia	LOCATION	, and officer in the Con - federate army , he played a prominent part in the politics of his time .

		Each of these features of his public career is carefully considered , important speeches and letters being intro - duced in appropriate connection by way of illustration .

		Mr.
Wise	PERSON	's own point of view has been indicated in his '' Seven Decades of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, '' and in many respects the grand - son adheres closely to the lines there laid down .

		There are special chapters devoted to the Graves-Cilley duel , in connection with which Mr.
Wise	PERSON	was severely blamed , to the Know - Nothing campaign of
1855	DATE	, which resulted in his election to the governorship of the state , and to the
John Brown	PERSON	raid and its conse - quences which brought upon his head a torrent of abuse .

		Opposing secession and strongly advocating the policy of making a fight within the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, he joined his fellow-citizens when
Virginia	LOCATION	seceded and cast his lot with the South .

		A third of the volume is given to 420 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, Civil War history as it affected his career , and in this part the book shares the criticism passed upon the other one already described .

		The interest clearly lags when the individuality of the roan is lost in the cause for which he fought .

		The biography is the work of one who loved his grandfather as a hero .

		Despite such a friendly relationship of author and subject , there is not that constant praise which might be expected .

		Faults are recognized , distinct failures are recorded , and on the whole the reader gets the impression that the volume is a fair presentation of the character of one who helped to make the history of
Virginia	LOCATION	before the war , and , considering
Virginia	LOCATION	's importance then , contributed not a little to the history of his party and his country .

		THE NEW BYRON .

		* The third volume of Byron 's Letters and Journalsf covers the period between
January , 1814	DATE	, and
November , 1816	DATE	, the period of `` The Corsair '' and `` Lara '' and the Third Canto of ''
Childe Harold	PERSON	, '' as well as of the ill-starred marriage and separation .

		The im - portance of the volume may only be partly inferred from the fact that more than half of the letters and other material it contains is here collected for the first time .

		In addition to 233 letters , there is an appendix containing 73 let - ters and other statements concerning the sepa - ration , most of them either by Lady Byron or by Mrs.
Leigh	PERSON	.

		There are , moreover , seven other appendices , containing , among other in - teresting material , a number of letters from
Byron	LOCATION	to
Miss Millbanke	LOCATION	and some extraordi - nary letters from
Jane Clainnont	PERSON	to
Byron	LOCATION	.

		With respect to the cause of the separation , Mr.
Prothero	PERSON	wisely takes a very cautious atti - tude .

		`` No evidence , '' he remarks , `` exists to prove the precise nature of the charges on which Lady Byron separated from her husband .

		They were , as Byron alleged , unknown to himself and his friends .

		It were very much to be hoped that all future biographers and critics would take the same conservative view .

		Unfortunately , however , it is too much to hope .

		This is the very sort of subject that excites the unwise to an incontinence of comment .

		The command - ment '' Judge not '' is the one least of all heeded by the '' unco guid , '' who doubtless imagine that the penalty of this particular law could have little peril for themselves .

		The usual assump - tion that there is some profound mystery behind the facts that have been disclosed is quite gratu - itous .

		One would think that mismated couples were unheard of , and the effects of '' incom - patibility of temper '' quite unknown .

		Accus - tomed to placid manners and regulated feelings , Lady
Byron	PERSON	was terrified by her lord 's out - bursts and deemed herself unsafe in his com - pany .

		Unable to understand the first principles of
Byron	PERSON	's character , she was naturally unequal to the role of governess .

		With all her admirable qualities , she was of a type most irritating to a man whose conduct was , unfortunately , regulated by generous impulses rather than by principle , which is so often but a fine name for calculation .

		That she was au innocent cause of irritation to him , none knew better than herself .

		Five days after she left
Byron	PERSON	's house , she wrote to his sister
Augusta	LOCATION	, with whom she was still on terms of the most affectionate con - fidence : * ' Disease or not all my recollections and reflections tend to convince me that the irritability is inseparably connected with me in a greater degree than with any other object , that my presence has been uniformly op - pressive to him from the hour we married if not before , and in his best moods he has always wished to be away from me . ''

		One can not but feel that this pathetic confes - sion tells us more than the most searching analysis of all the circumstances could possibly bring to light .

		Certainly a woman , whatever be her virtues and graces , whom a man in his best moods instinctively shuns , is scarcely the person marked out by nature to be his wife .

		If one looks for causes , one can find some hints in the dispirited and unimpassioned tone of
Byron	PERSON	's letters to her before marriage , in her own letters , and in the strongly-marked rather than winning features of her portrait prefixed to the volume before us .

		Here is an example of her epistolary style , from a letter to her husband written less than a month after she left him : '' I can not attribute your ' state of mind ' to any cause so much as the total dereliction of principle , which , since our marriage , you have professed and gloried in .

		THE DIAL 421 acknowledgements have not been accompanied by any intentions of amendment . ''

		Need it be wondered that to such '' representa - tions '' -LRB- to quote again the lady 's words -RRB- Byron '' had replied by a determination to be wicked '' ?

		One can not help speculating how matters would have stood had Lady
Byron	PERSON	been a little less uncompromising in her requirements , and had she formed her epistolary style upon some less
august	DATE	model .

		The second volume of
Byron	PERSON	's Poetry con - tains the whole of ''
Childe Harold	PERSON	. ''

		It is a pleasure to be able to say at once and compre - hensively that Mr.
Coleridge	PERSON	has given us not only the best edition of this classic hitherto produced , but an edition which leaves little in any sense to be desired .

		The text is based upon that of the Library Edition of
1855	DATE	, which has been collated with all the existing
MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		All the notes of
Byron	PERSON	and of
Hobhouse	PERSON	have been retained , and verified or supplemented by the editor , whose method and sympathetic attitude may be inferred from the following words of his Preface : '' It is in the belief that
Childe Harold	PERSON	' should be read continuously , and that it gains by the closest study , reassuming its original freshness and splendour , that the text as well as
Byron	PERSON	's own notes have been some - what minutely annotated . ''

		The variant readings of the
MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		are recorded underneath the text , and the notes of the editor are printed at the foot of the page .

		The vari - ants give convincing proof of
Byron	PERSON	's artistic taste , inasmuch as the finally preferred reading is , so far as I have observed , invariably the best .

		Mr.
Coleridge	PERSON	's notes not only give well authenticated information with respect to mat - ters of fact ; they also provide , unobtrusively and tastefully , interpretations of obscure pas - sages , and they call the attention of the reader to the thread of connection , or , as the case may be , to the underlying philosophy which one is apt to overlook -LRB- sometimes , indeed , without great loss -RRB- in one 's delight in the glowing im - ages and the vivid panorama .

		To each of the cantos is prefixed an introduction containing the history of the composition and publication of the work .

		Mr.
Coleridge	PERSON	points out that it consists really of three distinct poems bound together by the general scheme of the Pilgrim - age .

		And he does not conceal
Byron	PERSON	's indebted - ness in the second part of the poem -LRB- Canto III . -RRB-

		to
Shelley	LOCATION	, and in the third part -LRB- Canto IV . -RRB-

		to
Hobhouse	PERSON	. ''

		As the delicate spirit ' of Shelley suffused the third canto of '
Childe Harold	PERSON	, ' so the fourth reveals the pres - ence and cooperation of
Hobhouse	PERSON	.

		To his brother-poet he owed a fresh conception , perhaps a fresh apprecia - tion , of nature ; to his life-long friend , a fresh enthusi - asm for art , and a host of details , dry bones ... which he awakened into the fulness of life . ' ''

		Finally , Mr.
Coleridge	PERSON	gives the reader a timely reminder of the marked originality of design characterizing this splendid poem . '' '

		Childe Harold 's Pilgrimage ' had no progenitors , and , with the exception of some feeble and forgotten imitations , it has had no descendants .

		The materials of the poem , ... the sentiments and reflections coeval with reflection and sentiment , wear a familiar hue ; but the poem itself , a pilgrimage to scenes and cities of renown , a song of travel , a rhythmical diorama , was
Byron	PERSON	's own handiwork not an inheritance , but a creation . ''

		Five volumes of the twelve are now before us .

		It is already plain that the wealth of new material in the shape of additional or ungarbled letters , and other
Byroniana	LOCATION	, will compel critics and biographers to take a new survey of Byron .

		It seems to me probable that in the future more charitable judgments will prevail touching his character and aims .

		Certainly anything that throws new light upon a character so strong , so complex , and so puzzling , should be wel - comed as valuable materials for the future sci - ence of human nature .

		For the two scholarly editors , it is not too much to say that , in build - ing this noble monument to
Byron	LOCATION	, they are identifying themselves '' with the immortality of his fame . ''

		THE VALUE OF THE HISTORY OF ART .

		* There have been those who inquired , in a depreciatory way , as to the value of the study of the history of art .

		It has been felt that the study of historical art tends to take one away from the really vital examples of art in our own time ; makes one , often enough , elevate to an undeserved position some artist whose absolute value is slight , because of his relative import - ance ; leads one too often to concentrate the attention upon absolutely unimportant ques - tions of historical accuracy .

		We have all heard meaningless and absurd censures , as well as those just mentioned ; but these points are cer - tainly fairly taken : they show real dangers in the historical study of art , they point out what

		1 , is actually likely to take place with anyone who gets well fixed in the head the idea of historical value .

		Aside from these points which are merely dangers , not insuperable inconsistencies it is felt by many that the historical study of art brings to predominance , even if for the time only , a certain disposition which is not only not artistic but unfavorable to the artistic disposi - tion .

		The passion nowadays for it is almost 8U ch for knowing about the development of things , is something antagonistic , it is often thought , to the real enjoyment of those things .

		In matters of art , it substitutes for an artistic appreciation an intellectual understanding , which is a very different matter .

		We may pass these matters in review in our mind , and yet , whatever the value of historical study to those who merely love art without any idea of becoming artists , we can not well deny that the actual artist of our time , the painter of the present century , has profited to a con - siderable degree by the history of art .

		For one thing , there has been more history than there used to be ; for another , it has been more easy to get at it .

		But whatever the reason , the fact would probably not be disputed that the influ - ence of the past has been greater , for good and evil too , on the painters of this century than has ever before been the case .

		The matter is curiously indicated by three books which come to hand at the same moment , almost accidentally : one , a life of
Nicholas Poussin	PERSON	, one on
Luini	PERSON	, and one on
Velasquez	PERSON	.

		These three names are significant in the history of painting of our century .

		They are not sig - nificant of everything , it must be confessed ; they do not sum up the artistic movements of our time .

		But they are probably quite as sig - nificant in the question in hand as any other three names in the history of painting .

		You might substitute some other name for that of
Ponssin	LOCATION	, in some ways ,
Claude Lorraine	PERSON	would be better : you might say Botticelli in - stead of
Luini	LOCATION	.

		But although one or another substitution might be made , it would be hard to find any other three names as significant as these , so that the books are naturally of interest .

		The fame of
Nicholas Poussin	PERSON	is not what it used to be .

		In
1841	DATE	`` every school-boy , '' we are told , knew that he was called `` learned '' because of his profound classical knowledge ; at present you could find many older persons ignorant of the fact : there may even be lovers of art with very hazy ideas on the difference between him and that
Gaspar	PERSON	who took his name .

		It shows how times have changed in half a century .

		There was a time when the dicta of Mr.
Raskin	PERSON	on any painting or painter carried great weight .

		The poem of the man who mourned because cruel
Ruskin	PERSON	would stick his tusk in and nobody would buy , seems adequate illustration if not absolute proof .

		Even the fact that his comment on Mr.
Whistler	PERSON	's picture was thought by twelve good men and true to have injured that artist 's reputation to the extent of one farthing only , should not make us feel that Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	was not at one time a great authority on painting .

		It will be remembered that he won his eminence by a work which was meant to place
Turner	PERSON	in his rightful position : it may not be so often recalled that one of the purposes of '' Modern Painters '' was to show the superi - ority of modern artists , and especially
Turner	PERSON	, in landscape painting to the old masters .

		And the old -LRB- or `` older '' -RRB- masters in question , who were they ?

		It gives one who has forgotten a little start of surprise to recall that Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	was defending Turner against
Claude Lorraine	PERSON	,
Gaspar Poussin	PERSON	,
Salvator Rosa	PERSON	, and many others , some better known , but none of very vital interest to-day .

		It is among those masters that
Nicholas Poussin	PERSON	would naturally take his place .

		He was one of the earliest and most famous of that school that finally produced Sir
George Beaumont	PERSON	's brown tree .

		It is significant that Dr.
lizabeth Denio	PERSON	's monograph on
Poussin	LOCATION	is absolutely historical .

		It tells with a good deal of learning and detail what
Poussin	PERSON	painted and what he did from birth to death .

		But it does not have a single word in it which shows why the present gene - ration should have for
Poussin	PERSON	more than a historical curiosity .

		If one does wish to know about the man , it is well that one should have a careful record of his work ; and as such this book has value .

		But it would have been well to give some idea as to why one nowadays should wish to know anything about
Nicholas Poussin	PERSON	.

		Not to do so is hardly quite just to its subject .

		It is true that
Nicholas Poussin	PERSON	is not an influence to-day , as is his contemporary
Velasquez	PERSON	.

		Still , he deserves to be separated from the crowd of half-forgotten landscapists , even as a landscapist , and quite aside from the other directions of his genius .

		Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	who was very severe on many of his '' older masters , '' especially excepted
Nicholas Poussin	PERSON	, found in him things worthy of recollection and preserva - tion , and even held him to be at times a lover
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 423 of truth .

		It would have been well , in a book like this , to have this distinction brought out ; as it is not , the book can hardly be considered adequate from the point of view of the student of art .

		It has good points as a biography -LRB- though charm of style is not one of them -RRB- ; and , though not profusely illustrated , has sev - eral pictures which are well chosen for the ex - hibition of
Poussin	LOCATION	's different characteristics .

		The older masters the '' Van somethings and Back somethings , '' to use Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	's phrase passed away , so far as immediate in - fluence was concerned .

		Who took their place ?

		Not immediately , nor universally indeed but , more than any other group , the Preraphaelites : that is to say , the historical ones , the Primitives , to use perhaps a better name .

		We all know how long the Preraphaelites , for the English and ourselves at least , were on the top of the wave as the masters par excel - lence .

		They are commonly included in the mind of one who looks back upon the period of their ascendency , under the name of
Botticelli	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is no longer a name to conjure with .

		But what a name it was once !

		The whole merit of the painters who preceded and accompanied
Raphael	PERSON	was sublimated in that splendid name .

		It was a name of such power that under its spell many worthy people went through great tor - ment to admire what they did not like .

		Yet
Botticelli	PERSON	was not the first , the original Pre - raphaelite .

		It was not till
1871	DATE	that Mr.
Rus	PERSON	- kin startled cultivated
England	LOCATION	by pronounc - ing that mystic name in a tone which implied that everyone ought to know all about it .

		When Mr.
Pater	PERSON	wrote of him so delightfully , he still had the charm of novelty .

		The Preraphaelite Brotherhood had existed long before , long be - fore Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	had perceived that they were but carrying out his own principles .

		But al - though called `` Preraphaelite '' they were really not actually so any more than he was : they cared far more for their own principles than for any set of painters before or after
Raphael	PERSON	; indeed , that was the principle of most impor - tance with them .

		They really turned attention to the Primitives , and were not actually in - spired by them .

		Still , that was the important thing .

		When Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	began to interest himself in the earlier painters , his first great discovery was
Luini	PERSON	.

		Thus
Luini	PERSON	is typical of a great influence in art .

		Yet he can hardly be said to have been an influence himself .

		For one thing ,
Luini	PERSON	is not exactly a Preraphaelite ; for an - other , he has often been regarded , if at all , as an imitator of Lionardo .

		Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	found in him wonderful things .

		It is said by Mr.
Col	PERSON	- lingwood that Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	never said as much about
Luini	PERSON	as he meant to say .

		This may be : he did go so far as to say that
Luini	PERSON	was ten times as great as
Lionardo	LOCATION	, and that every touch that he laid was eternal .

		Still ,
Luini	PERSON	, although always immensely interesting , has hardly been himself an influence .

		Mr.
Williamson	PERSON	's book on
Luini	PERSON	is the first of a series projected under his editorship , a series which will offer valuable books to the student at a moderate price .

		The main fea - tures of the plan seem to be very liberal illus - tration -LRB- there are about forty reproductions in this volume and as many in the companion '' Velasquez '' -RRB- and a very careful list and de - scription of all the pictures known .

		Besides , there is a bibliography , and , of course , the life .

		In the case of
Luini	PERSON	, the life is not so purely historical as in the book on Poussin : it is , however , not very artistic either ; it is in fact critical , and that in the school of
Morelli	PERSON	on the whole .

		Mr.
Williamson	PERSON	has a very considerable field ; there has been very little work done already on the subject .

		A great deal of his work is , then , extremely valuable as supplying what can not be found anywhere else .

		It is hardly necessary to introduce a book on Velasquez by remarking that as the keen - ness of interest in the Primitives gradually waned , it became apparent that
Velasquez	PERSON	was the man of the future .

		He has probably by this time arrived at his apogee .

		The man whose pictures remind one not only of
Whistler	LOCATION	and
Sargent	PERSON	, but of
Carolus Duran	PERSON	and
Hen	ORGANIZATION	- ner , not to mention a dozen more as important , has done all that one can expect .

		Mr.
Steven	PERSON	- son 's book is not unnaturally written in a dif - ferent manner from the two others .

		A book on
Poussin	ORGANIZATION	is almost inevitably historic or academic in character ; one on
Luini	PERSON	will very naturally be critical even more than apprecia - tive ; a book on
Velasquez	PERSON	must almost of course be enthusiastic and polemical .

		Neces - sary or not , that is what Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	is ; nor does the fact impair the value of his book , which is much the most interesting of the three in our present group , while its illustration is as adequate as that of the
Luini	PERSON	volume , and its list of pictures as complete , although Mr.
Williamson	PERSON	, the general editor who made it , disclaims the intention of being very critical in his attributions .

		It is not his especial field , nor , indeed , anybody else 's , perhaps because 4l > 4 THE J3IAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, of the reasons urged by Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	is naturally no great admirer of the school of
Morelli	PERSON	, and dislikes '' the counting of curls , the measuring of thumbs , the tracing of poses . ''

		He has supplied a very interesting book , however , written from the standpoint of the artist and dealing with the really .

		artistic questions .

		It is not a matter of biography with him , nor of history : it is a question of painting .

		If one has been interested in the painting of this century , and is still unaware of the masters whose work is dealt with in these books , one will be surprised , on turning to them , to see how strong has been the influence of the past on our time .

		It has not been the only influence , by any means , nor is it fully represented in the books here noticed ; but it is worth knowing about .

		What are we to make of such books ?

		What is their value to one who is not a student , but whose aim is to enjoy the art which actually comes before his eyes ?

		To those who can readily visit
France	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	,
Spain	LOCATION	, it will be perhaps a matter of importance to know some - thing about
Poussin	PERSON	,
Luini	PERSON	,
Velasquez	PERSON	.

		But how about the rest , who rarely see much of anything beyond current reproductions and current exhibitions ?

		It is surely a scholastic matter to know that this man was influenced by such an one , however famous ; that this element in his art came from this man , and that element from that man .

		Does it not with - draw our attention from the general impression of a man 's power , and cultivate merely a super - ficial knowingness which is often content to dash away the possibility of deep enjoyment for the chance of a clever shrug of the shoulders ?

		It may certainly do so : in fact , it does so with many people .

		But there are still reasons why it is well to know a good deal about the history of art .

		It is well to know that an art - ist is often ingenious and imitative rather than self-possessed and great .

		It is well also to know that fashions in art have often changed , and that one must have a steady head in think - ing of the art of one 's own time .

		But aside from these two pieces of abstract knowledge , which may or may not be useful to one , it is further well to get into the habit of seeing what is good anywhere and making it one 's own .

		And this sort of cultivation of the taste is rather better attained by the art of some time ago than by the art of to-day .

		HOLIDAY PUBLICATIONS .

		L The prodigal genius of the
Prince of Painters	ORGANIZATION	is fitly symbolized in the luxurious make-up and lavish pictorial equipment of the two noble imperial octavo volumes containing Miss
Elizabeth Lee	PERSON	's Englinh version of
M. Ktnile Michel	PERSON	's '' Rubens , His Life , His Work , and His Time '' -LRB-
Scribner	ORGANIZATION	's
Importa	LOCATION	- tion -RRB- .

		This work , the companion of
M. Michel	ORGANIZATION	's monumental work on Rembrandt issued some
five years ago	DATE	, must be pronounced easily and at all points the leader in our list of Holiday publications .

		As the biographer of
Rubens	LOCATION	, the author has had a far richer and ampler field of exploitation than as the biographer of Rembrandt , whose obscure , com - mon , and even dingy life as a man left behind it but scanty and uninviting materials for its literary reconstruction .

		Rubens , on the contrary , the -LRB- < - turesque and many-sided genius ; the man of travel , of science , of literary tastes and culture , of courtly adventure and gallant , chivalrous mien ; the am - bassador at the courts of
Spain	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	; the friend of sovereigns and statesmen , left behind him the amplest store of picturesque memorials of his career .

		He touched and adorned life at many points ; and his interest for us as man of action and of the brilliant world of courts and cabinets is scarcely secondary to his interest for us as the pro- fuse painter whose protean genius covered
Europe	LOCATION	with his auroral canvases .

		The very abundance of biographical material , the fertility of production and universality of gift , prove , in a way , initial diffi - culties with which the critic and biographer of Rubens , who essays to fuse in a single , comprehen - sive , logically-ordered '' Life '' the various phases and epochs of that multifarious career , must con - tend .

		There is hardly a term , however brief or vaguely defined , of
Ruben	PERSON	's life , a phase , however passing , of his tireless activity , that has not been made the subject of a monograph .

		Recent scholars and critic - , especially Belgian , have vied in the pursuit of fresh discoveries touching the man and his works .

		Of these scattered and multitudinous writings , and of the voluminous correspondence of the painter ,
M. Michel	PERSON	has freely availed himself , quoting where necessary , digesting into his own terms of thought and language for the most part .

		All the galleries of
Europe	LOCATION	in which the master 's works are to be found have been revisited , his foot - steps in
Italy	LOCATION	,
Spain	LOCATION	,
Flanders	PERSON	, and especially in his loved city of
Antwerp	LOCATION	have been retraced .

		* I have , '' says
M. Michel	PERSON	, '' lived almost exclusively with
Rubens	PERSON	for several years '' ; but , let us add , it is
Ruben	PERSON	's art which is mainly and essentially his theme .

		Still less , necessarily , than in his book on Rembrandt has it been possible for
M. Michel	PERSON	to give a complete catalogue of works .

		The briefest descriptive mention of the 1,200 paintings and 400 drawings of this most prolific of painters would have alone filled the volume * .

		The author has therefore restricted himself to the mention at the
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 425 end of the book of the collections , public and private , containing the most numerous or most important examples .

		The illustration of these volumes is on the most liberal scale , and we need scarcely say that the appeal is to the cultivated rather than the popular taste .

		Where color is used it is used spar - ingly in fact there is just a hint or suggestion of it .

		There are no garish , and therefore necessarily false , colored plates inserted as a bait for the buyer of the mere u picture-book . ''

		M.
Michel	PERSON	's book may fairly be termed an art-work , in the real and specific sense of that much abused term , which re - cent usage has made far too elastic .

		The six-penny magazine reprint , with its half-tone abominations , is nowadays styled an `` art-work , '' and that too in quarters where a more discriminating choice of terms might be looked for .

		There are , in all , in the two volumes , forty colored plates , forty photogravures , and 272 text illustrations .

		It has been aimed to include , besides the inevitable and indispensable masterpieces , examples which , through variety of subject , may serve to give an idea of that universality which is perhaps the most striking characteristic of Rubens .

		History , landscape , portraiture , animal - painting , genre , still-life the brush of Rubens touched no branch of his art without adorning it .

		Photography has been relied on for the reproduc - tions , '' as the process best calculated to secure accuracy '' ; and the mechanical work touches high - water mark in its kind .

		The translation is fluent and easy , and appears to be accurate .

		This fine work of
M. Michel	PERSON	's deserves fuller and more critical treatment than can be accorded it here , for it is really one of scholarship , in its class , and the fruit of a long period of painstaking research .

		But we must content ourselves now with confidently pro- nouncing it a book for every student of Rubens to '' read , mark , learn , and inwardly digest , '' and , if possible , to possess .

		Mr.
C. D. Gibson	PERSON	's '' Education of Mr.
Pipp	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Russell	PERSON	-RRB- is an amusing pictorial satire , and a very clever thing in its way , ai-tistically .

		It comprises a series of pictures -LRB- not too conventionally
Gibson	PERSON	- ian -RRB- in which is unfolded the tale of the initiation of Mr.
Pipp	PERSON	, a rich but untravelled American pater - familias , into the doubtful joys of European travel and the ways of European society .

		The chief ini - tiators are Mrs.
Pipp	PERSON	and her two lovely daughters -LRB-
Gibson	PERSON	girls `` down to the ground '' -RRB- ; and these conspirers against Mr.
Pipp	PERSON	's peace and purse are later ably abetted by Lady
Fitzmaurice	PERSON	and son -LRB- En - glish tourists -RRB- , a rascally courier , a dingy `` Dago '' Duke and ditto Prince , and the usual host of mil - liners , jewellers , etc. .

		Mr.
Pipp	PERSON	'' does ''
London	LOCATION	,
Paris	LOCATION	, the
Riviera	LOCATION	,
Rome	LOCATION	, etc. , in the usual way ; is '' done '' by the courier , whom , however , he '' polishes off '' handsomely , d la Mr.
Robert Fitzsimmons	PERSON	, to the joy and pride of his assembled womankind and Lady
Fitzmaurice	PERSON	; picks a few winners at the Der - by ; has a `` night off '' at
Paris	LOCATION	, and a consultation of physicians next day ; breaks the bank at
Monte Carlo	ORGANIZATION	; and winds up his European tour in the mod - ern way by acquiring an ornamental English son - in-law -LRB- well-born but impecunious -RRB- , to the gratifi - cation of Mrs.
Pipp	PERSON	and the confusion of her social rivals at home .

		Mr.
Pipp	PERSON	's `` education '' seems to be tolerably complete in the closing picture , wherein we see him dandling a pair of `` kids '' -LRB- one
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	- American , the other unhyphenated -RRB- one on each knee , with grandpaternal joy .

		The book seems to us about the best thing Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	has done so far , and it deserves a cordial welcome at the hands of his public .

		A rather attractive publication of a semi-religious cast is the Rev.
Alexander Mackennal	PERSON	's '' Homes and Haunts of the Pilgrim Fathers '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- .

		As the title implies , the interest of the book is mainly pictorial , though Dr.
Mackennal	PERSON	's running commentary on the themes supplied by the pictures is in itself instructive and readable .

		The illustra - tions embrace a colored frontispiece -LRB- a view of Scrooby ,
Nottinghamshire	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- and ninety-three illus - trations in black-and-white from drawings and pho - tographs by
Charles Whymper	PERSON	.

		Text and plates deal exclusively with the seats of Puritanism before the exodus to
America	LOCATION	, the aim of the book being to pictorially set before the reader buildings , places , objects , and portraits in
England	LOCATION	and
Holland	LOCATION	in - dubitably associated with the
Pilgrim Fathers	ORGANIZATION	.

		Thus , the artist has reproduced , wherever possible , structures and objects of interest which it is prac - tically certain that the Fathers must have them - selves seen , and views of the towns and villages where they are known to have resided , and the buildings where they undoubtedly worshipped .

		The local views selected are mainly such as have been but little affected by the lapse of time , and are to - day much what they were in the seventeenth cen - tury .

		Drawings are given from
Scrooby	LOCATION	,
Auster	PERSON	- field ,
Boston	LOCATION	,
Gainsborough	LOCATION	,
York	LOCATION	,
Plymouth	LOCATION	,
Stan	PERSON	- dish Hall ,
Southampton	LOCATION	, and
Cambridge	LOCATION	, in Eng - land ; and places and buildings associated with the sojourn in
Holland	LOCATION	have not been slighted by the illustrator .

		The binding is of light-blue and gold , text and pictures are handsomely printed on calen - dered paper , and altogether the work forms a very suitable gift for a friend who rejoices in the fact that he -LRB- or she -RRB- is `` of Puritan stock . ''

		Everyone has a friend of this sort nowadays .

		The luxurious appointments and taking theme of the Messrs.
Putnams	PERSON	' fine royal octavo volume en - titled '' Famous Homes of
Great Britain	LOCATION	and their Stories '' make it one of the most imposing of the season 's gift-books ; and the list of contributors to the work adds something to this impression .

		In - stead of the stereotyped tale of the usual menial cicerone , whose manner and degree of civility are nicely conformed to his -LRB- or usually her -RRB- computa - tion of the probable size of the visitor 's `` tip , '' we are in this volume , as it were , '' shown through '' the several mansions described , by the titled master or mistress thereof , in person .

		For instance , our guide through the stately halls of
Blenheim	ORGANIZATION	is the Duke of
Marlborough	LOCATION	himself , who recounts briefly its 426 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, history , and calls our attention to the more impor - tant of hia ancestral treasures , trophies , portraits , etc. ; the honors of
Battle Abbey	ORGANIZATION	are done by the Duchess of
Cleveland	LOCATION	; of
Holland House	ORGANIZATION	, by the Hon.
Caroline Roche	PERSON	; of
Cawdor Castle	ORGANIZATION	, by Vis - count Kmlyn ; of
Penshurst	LOCATION	, by Lady De L'Isle and
Dudley	PERSON	; of
Warwick Castle	ORGANIZATION	, by the
Countess of Warwick	ORGANIZATION	; of Ly me , by the Dowager Lady
Newton	LOCATION	; and so forth .

		All this is very flattering to the pride of the aspiring reader ; and it must be admitted that the descriptions are in each case well done , and with a dignity , modesty , and absence of `` gush '' or twaddle , that makes them contrast very agreeably with the usual performances of the mercenary guide and the shrine-hunting writer of travels .

		The book is beautifully illustrated with exterior and interior views of the stately homes described , with cuts of choice architectural details , family portraits , historic apartments , etc. .

		The editor of the volume , Mr.
A. H. Malan	PERSON	, contributes three or four of the chapters .

		The pictorial allurements and general beauty of manufacture of Messrs.
Little	PERSON	,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	's two - volume illustrated Holiday edition of
Francis Park	PERSON	- man 's
Montcalm	LOCATION	and
Wolfe	PERSON	'' will inevitably tempt to a re-perusal of the fascinating pages of this roman - tic picture of a most romantic phase of American history .

		We could hardly suggest a better or more stimulating gift for an imaginative American boy or youth with a spice of adventurous longing in his blood than these volumes , which tell so fascinatingly the tale of the fall of French power in
Canada	LOCATION	, and embody perhaps the most important of Mr.
Park	PERSON	- man 's histories .

		The illustrations comprise forty - one photogravure plates , mostly portraits from the original paintings or from rare mezzotints , and reproductions of contemporary prints .

		There are two good portraits of the author , one of them from a daguerreotype taken at the period of early man - hood .

		The bindings of sea-blue and gold are taste - ful , and complete an ensemble as sound as it is attractive .

		Purchasers of Holiday books this year will be strongly attracted by
The Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	's elegantly sumptuous edition of Dr.
Weir Mitchell	PERSON	's fine American historical novel , ''
Hugh Wynne	PERSON	, Free Quaker . ''

		The good qualities of Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	's book have already been enlarged upon in our col - umns , and we need only comment here upon its present setting .

		The bindings of the two shapely vol - umes are of buff and gold .

		The copious illustrations comprise views of historic sites and buildings of old
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, reproduced from rare prints loaned by collectors for the purpose ; portraits after old originals ; photographic plates of scenes in modern
Philadelphia	LOCATION	; and imaginative drawings by Mr.
Howard Pyle	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Pyle	PERSON	appears to much advan - tage in these spirited and dramatic drawings , which , we fancy , will elicit Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	's cordial approval .

		On the whole , it would be difficult , we think , to better this edition of Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	's chef-d'oeuvre for such we conceive it to be especially on its pictorial side .

		Mr.
W. T. Smedley	PERSON	's familiar qualities as an illustrator find wide exemplification in the hand - some quarto volume containing fifty of his draw - ings selected from various sources , and entitled `` Life and Character '' -LRB- Harper -RRB- .

		The pictures have a page apiece of explanatory text by Mr.
A. V. S. Anthony	PERSON	, and Mr.
Arthur Hoeber	PERSON	furnishes a few pages of introductory matter , biographical and eulogistic .

		Mr.
Hoeber	PERSON	's praise is well bestowed .

		Mr.
Smedley	PERSON	knows his types , is always refined and self-contained , and has the due degree of technical skill .

		A book that deals with every day types of actual life , and makes no great tax on the artist 's fancy , can have no better illustrator than in Mr.
Smedley	PERSON	the sound , conscientious and lasting Mr.
Smedley	PERSON	.

		Text and plates are handsomely printed on calendered paper , and altogether the volume , with its soberly elegant binding of green-and-gold , is one of the best of the essentially pictorial ones .

		`` Bohemian Paris of To - Day '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , written by Mr.
W. C. Morrow	PERSON	from notes by
M. Edouard Cucuel	PERSON	, and illustrated by the latter gen - tleman , is a remarkably `` lively '' book , pictorially and otherwise , and should prove a joy to readers with a stomach for the life it depicts .

		In it the untravelled and unsophisticated person may see through the eyes of men who have seen it all pre - cisely how the volatile occupants of the monkeys ' cage of
Paris	LOCATION	, namely , its Quartier Latin , comport themselves .

		The spectacle will amuse him or dis - gust him according to his years or temperament . ''

		The purpose of text and pictures , '' says the author , '' is to show Bohemian life in the city of
Paris	LOCATION	with - out any concealment , '' '' with the frankness of a student , '' and -LRB- he assures us -RRB- '' the students are the pets of
Paris	LOCATION	. ''

		Clearly , then ,
Paris	LOCATION	suffers fools gladly , for Mr.
Morrow	PERSON	's students appear to be mostly fools , with an agreeable dah of the black - guard and the cheap rake superadded .

		Not a few of the scenes described in this `` frank '' book will inspire the masculine reader with a strong desire to kick the actors therein , even at the i i-k of defiling bis boots .

		Take , for example , the account of the breaking in of a new girl model at the art school '' a joy , '' Mr.
Morrow	PERSON	artlessly assures us , '' that the students never permit themselves to miss . '' ''

		The new one is accompanied by two or more of her girl friends , who give her encouragement at the terri - ble moment when she disrobes .

		As there are no dressing-rooms , there can be no privacy .

		The stu - dents gather about and watch the proceedings with great interest , and make whatever remarks tlu-ir deviltry can suggest ... When , finally , after an inconceivable struggle with her shame , the girl plunges ahead in reckless haste to finish the job , the students applaud her roundly ... But more torture awaits her .

		It is then '' -LRB- when the poor creature , at last completely en cueros , or '' all .

		face '' as the Indians say , awkwardly attempts , at the bid - ding of her chivalrous employers , to pose -RRB- `` that the fiend ishness of the students rises to its greatest height ... One claims that her waist is too long
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 427 and her legs too heavy '' -LRB- ' is ' too heavy -RRB- ; '' another hotly takes the opposite view ... At last - she is made to don her hat and stockings ; and the stu - dents form a ring about her and dance and shout until she is ready to faint . ''

		All this brutal tom - foolery is clearly thought by Mr.
Morrow	PERSON	to be '' smart '' and funny .

		On the whole , the average art student of the Quartier Latin , as depicted by Mr.
Morrow	PERSON	, is a disagreeable blend of the cad , the clown , and the six-penny rou6 .

		A chapter is devoted to the '' Bal des Quat ` z ' - Arts , '' and another one to '' Le Boul ' Mich ' '' ; and several classic Bo - hemian haunts are graphically described .

		The text is readable enough and informing enough in its small way , but the essential and redeeming feature of the book is the illustrations , which are decidedly clever and gratifyingly profuse .

		To come at the root of English character and study the national qualities that are specifically English , one must , as Irving wrote , `` go forth into the country ; he must sojourn in villages and ham - lets ; ... he must wander through parks and gar - dens ; along hedges and green lanes ; he must loiter about country churches ; and cope with people in all their conditions , and all their habits and hu - mors . ''

		As a preparation for the pleasant series of papers comprised in his '' Among English Hedge - rows '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr.
Clifton Johnson	PERSON	has fol - lowed literally and conscientiously the above good counsel .

		The book , with its delightful pictures , the spoil of the author 's camera , forms the best substitute for an actual foot-tour in rural
England	LOCATION	that has fallen in our way in a long time .

		The con - tents of it have already appeared serially in various journals , and are well worth reprinting in this taste - ful volume .

		Mr.
Hamilton W. Mabie	PERSON	supplies an introduction .

		Mr.
Joel Cook	PERSON	's ''
England Picturesque	ORGANIZATION	and De - scriptive '' -LRB-
Henry T. Coates & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is a rather unusually attractive specimen of the now familiar type of photographically illustrated literary guide - book .

		There are fifty full - page photogravures from original negatives , and these are excellent specimens of their class in every respect .

		The two crown 8vo volumes are beautifully manufactured through - out , and should not be overlooked by the discrimi - nating seeker of a choice and substantial Holiday gift-book .

		Mr.
Cook	PERSON	's itinerary shows a careful and intelligently conceived plan .

		He appears to have visited most of the points of prime general interest in
England	LOCATION	and
Wales	LOCATION	, and we should say that the comparatively untravelled tourist who wishes to lay out his time and money to the best possible advantage could scarcely do better than follow Mr.
Cook	PERSON	's path with these beautiful and suggestive volumes as a guide .

		The work is divided into ten tours , with
Liverpool	ORGANIZATION	and
London	LOCATION	as the main starting-points , each sub-route following the most approved and most profitable lines .

		The text is pleasantly interwoven with a slight running thread of history , legend , and local anecdote , and Mr.
Cook	PERSON	's style is pleasing and animated , and well calculated to stimulate the reader 's interest in the beautiful and storied regions described .

		A good map adds to the practical usefulness of the work , and the author has not neglected to supply the in - dispensable Index .

		Messrs.
Dana Estes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	issue an illustrated Holiday edition , in three royal octavo volumes , of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's '' French Revolution . ''

		The volumes are handsome enough to make one wonder at the re - markably modest price , all things considered , asked for them .

		Print and paper are good , the bindings are dainty and tasteful , and there are ten full-page plates to the volume .

		The portraits given are mostly well chosen , and several of them are after rare and decidedly interesting originals those of
Rousseau	PERSON	and Carnot , for example .

		The frontis - piece to the set is a well-executed portrait of the author .

		Other subjects are : the
Rolands	PERSON	-LRB- both plates after Lavachez -RRB- ,
Louis XVI.	LOCATION	, Mme. du
Barry	PERSON	,
Mirabeau	LOCATION	,
Bailly	PERSON	,
Lafayette	LOCATION	, Mme. de Gen - lis ,
Marat	PERSON	,
Pitt	PERSON	,
Danton	LOCATION	,
St. Just	LOCATION	,
Hoche	ORGANIZATION	, etc. .

		There are also reproductions of Flameng 's ''
Marie Antoinette	PERSON	On the Way to Execution , '' and
Sar	ORGANIZATION	- doux 's engraving of
Versailles	LOCATION	.

		Altogether this is an excellent popular pictorial edition of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's masterpiece but the unaccountable lack of an index must be deplored .

		Mr.
Frederick Simpson Coburn	PERSON	and Miss Mar - garet
Armstrong	ORGANIZATION	, respectively the illustrator and the decorator of Irving 's '' Rip Van Winkle '' and '' Legend of Sleepy Hollow , '' published each in a volume by the Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	and boxed together , have been perhaps a thought too lavish of their work , especially of the marginal decorations , which seem to rather overwhelm and drown out the little square of text peeping through them .

		In them - selves , the decorative borders , which are printed in light-green and in sepia , are pleasing enough , as are the vignettes on the back of each leaf .

		Mr.
Co	PERSON	- burn 's drawings in wash are generally good in several cases notably good .

		The volumes are richly bound in dark-red and gilt , and paper and print are unexceptionable .

		A season or so ago we took occasion to praise a pretty book by that expert knight -LRB- or , as some would say , '' fiend '' -RRB- of the camera , Mr.
Alexander Black	PERSON	, entitled ''
Miss America	LOCATION	, '' and enriched with any number of portraits of that bewitching and racially composite young woman .

		This year Mr.
Black	PERSON	is again to the fore with a similar and equally attractive book , entitled '' Modern Daughters '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , and containing a galaxy of photographs of the American girl that ought to make the Ameri - can young man feel glad that he was born in a land of such golden opportunities .

		The portraits are prettily vignetted in the text , which consists of re - produced talks enjoyed by Mr.
Black	PERSON	with all sorts of American girls the `` Left-Over Girl , '' the `` Gym Girl , '' the `` Engaged Girl , '' the '' Ddbu - tante , '' the '' Club Girl , '' '' the Bride , '' and so on . ''

		Conversations with
Various American Girls	ORGANIZATION	and One Man , '' is the sub-title .

		Mr.
Black	PERSON	has caught THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, the mental accent and turn of speech of the fairer half of
America	LOCATION	's '' smart set '' nicely , and his pho - tographs are charming of course .

		The book is bright and witty , tastily got up throughout , and should prove one of the most popular of the lighter Christmas publications .

		The delightful readiness it implies on the part of our Modern Daughters to pose for Mr.
Black	PERSON	and consequently for the pub - lic is not the least striking thing about it .

		Coaching literature receives an important and authoritative addition in Mr.
Fair	PERSON	man
Rogers	ORGANIZATION	's '' A Manual of Coaching '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The subject , we think , has never been more thoroughly and scientifically treated than it is in this volume , which is distinctly a book for the amateur coachman who wishes to be absolutely au fait in all that pertains to his hobby .

		Mr.
Rogers	PERSON	approaches his theme in a serious , one might almost say a reverential , spirit .

		He first sketches , in the real scientific temper , the evolution of the coach , from its germ in the rude farm-wagon of the ancient Romans , down to the elaborate and highly developed '' Tally-ho '' a term , by-the-by , which he warns us is not scientific - ally accurate , and which , therefore , is to be avoided by coaching men who are scrupulous in matters appertaining to good form .

		It is hardly possible here to do justice to the thoroughness with which Mr.
Rogers	PERSON	-LRB- upon whom the mantle or many - caped box-coat of the elder Weller seems to have descended -RRB- goes into the details and technicalities of coaches , their varieties , accessories , and equip - ments .

		The mysteries of the harness also receive due attention , and the theory and practice of driv - ing is unfolded and illustrated in several erudite chapters .

		A whole chapter is devoted to that very essential topic , '' The Whip and Its Use . ''

		Other chapters treat exhaustively of such matters as coach - ing dress , public coaching , road coaching , coaching trips , rules of the road , accidents , clubs , music for the horn , etc. .

		A coaching bibliography is appended .

		The book is practically , as well as very attractively , illustrated , and it is got up generally in a way that is suggestive of the gift-book and indeed no more suitable one could be found for a friend of coach - ing , or , indeed , of generally '' horsey '' proclivities .

		The elegant form and sterling content of
Messrs. Henry T. Coates & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's new illustrated edition of Prof.
J. P. Mahaffy	PERSON	' g `` Rambles and Studies in
Greece	LOCATION	'' make it one of the most desirable of the solider Holiday publications .

		The reprint is from the third and heretofore the latest edition , and con - tains therefore the added chapter on medieval
Greece	LOCATION	, together with the new notes and paragraphs added passim by the author with a view of increas - ing the value of the work as a traveller 's hand - book and literary companion .

		There are thirty - four beautifully executed and well chosen photo - graphic plates showing scenes in modern
Greece	LOCATION	that are hallowed by classic story and association , architectural remains , sculptures , etc. .

		A good map is a decidedly useful feature .

		The reader of this beautiful book , in which a traveller 's reminiscences and a scholar 's culture are so charmingly and prof - itably blended , will find Dr.
Mahaffy	PERSON	's Byronie enthusiasm for the land of Pericles and
Epatninon	PERSON	- das contagious and inspiring .

		But Dr.
Mahaffy	PERSON	's enthusiasm , however , does not prevent him from entertaining the view that the pictures usually drawn of the old Greeks are highly idealized , the real people having been of a quite different and a much lower type .

		His estimate of the common people of ancient
Greece	LOCATION	coincides in some degree with the rather dampening opinions advanced in the
Grice	PERSON	contemporaine of About .

		With the theory of Fal - lermeyer that the old Greek race utterly perished , the modern inhabitants being descendants of Slav - onic and Albanian invaders and settlers , Professor
Mahaffy	PERSON	strongly disagrees ; but he is careful to deny the charge sometimes made that he has drawn freely upon modern Greek life and character for his pictures of classic times .

		But we must not be drawn here into anything like a discussion or expo - sition of the theoretical side of this charming and popular book , which is mainly descriptive in treat - ment , and which aims largely to bring home to the reader the living features of
Greece	LOCATION	, by connecting them with the facts of older history .

		The volume , a tastefully bound crown 8vo , will prove an enticing one to the book-buyer of fastidious tastes .

		Messrs.
T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	issue , at a moderate price , a very presentable two - volume edition of
George Eliot	PERSON	's '' Middle march . ''

		The type is fair , the binding is plain but sightly , and there are eighteen illustrations after drawings by
Alice Bar	ORGANIZATION	- ber
Stephens	PERSON	.

		The frontispiece to Volume II .

		is an etched portrait of the author .

		Altogether it is a very good edition for actual use .

		Miss
Stephens	PERSON	's drawings seem to us for the most part decidedly well done and intelligently conceived .

		So much can scarcely be said in praise of Mr.
Reginald Birch	PERSON	's pen-drawings in Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's edition of
George Eliot	PERSON	's ''
Silas Marner	PERSON	. ''

		The pictures are not bad themselves , but their illus - trative quality is not remarkable .

		Otherwise , the volume is a decidedly pleasing one , and should attract new readers to the enjoyment of this fine novel .

		Very pretty and artistic in its kind is the flat large 4to volume entitled '' Wild Flowers '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , containing twelve plates handsomely printed in tints after the water-color designs of Mrs.
Ellis Rowan	PERSON	.

		Mrs.
Rowan	PERSON	has displayed much taste in the selec - tion and arrangement of her subjects , her colors are pure and accurate , and her treatment is just broad enough being neither '' splashy , '' on the one hand , nor finical on the other .

		In tine , all her flowers seem to lack is the perfume .

		The subjects are : Wild Honeysuckle ; Cardinal Flower ;
Musk Mallow	PERSON	;
Monkshood	LOCATION	; Wild Pink ; Fringed Gen - tian ; Oswego Tea ; etc. .

		The cover is of pale green and pearl grey delicately stamped with title in gilt and conventionalized flower design .

		Little variation from the familiar type is shown in
Messrs. Houghton	LOCATION	,
Mif & in & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's two-volume
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 429 '' Roman '' edition of
Hawthorne	PERSON	's '' Marble Faun . ''

		The volumes are conveniently small , and are illus - trated with photographic plates of Roman and Flor - entine views , sculptures , etc. .

		Gilt tops , red slip - covers , and bindings of cream - white with bold design in gilt , complete a fairly attractive exterior .

		Mr.
Howard Pyle	PERSON	serves notice on his readers through the title-page of his '' The Price of Blood '' -LRB-
R. G. Badger & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , that the tale is to be consid - ered an '' extravaganza . ''

		Certainly it is a sorry piece of nonsense , suggestive of nothing save a des - perate effort on Mr.
Pyle	PERSON	's part to be as nonsensi - cal as possible .

		And nonsense that is obviously labored is seldom amusing .

		As a vehicle for the grotesque drawings that accompany it the story does very well ; and that we dare say is what it is intended for .

		But it is a pity to find so capital an illustrator of the whimsical and bizarre as Mr.
Pyle	PERSON	is wasting time spinning out poor extravaganzas of his own to illustrate , when there are so many good ones by others ready to his pencil .

		We should very much like to see , for example , what Mr.
Pyle	PERSON	would make of von Chamisso 's ''
Peter Schlemihl	PERSON	'' that strange mingling of pathos and folly .

		The scene of Mr.
Pyle	PERSON	's '' extravaganza '' is laid in
New York	LOCATION	, temp .

		1807 .

		The hero is
Nathaniel Griscombe	PERSON	, a young attorney-at-law with no practice , and a turn for conviviality .

		Griscombe 's threadbare and com - monplace fortunes become suddenly entangled with the lurid and tragic or tragico-comic ones of a deposed East Indian Rajah who holds his court secretly on Broadway , who is pursued by the ven - geance of '' an Oriental Potentate , '' and who has a brother -LRB- also '' pursued '' -RRB- named ''
Michael Des	PERSON	- mond '' -LRB- ! -RRB-

		living at
Bordentown	LOCATION	,
N. J	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
Rajah	PERSON	becomes a client of
Griscombe	ORGANIZATION	's , confides to him his secret and a hat-box full of jewels and then fol - lows the nonsense , '' clotted '' and plenty of it , and for the most part unredeemed by the light and whimsical fancy that make Mr.
Pyle	PERSON	's illustrations so delightful .

		The pictures in this very attractively manufactured volume are printed in colors , and the showy frontispiece is in the artist 's best style .


Marion Harland	PERSON	's facile pen has been well em - ployed in the little biographies of
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	and
William Cowper	PERSON	, which form the initial volumes of Messrs.
Putnams	PERSON	' promising series of studies of the home-life of certain writers and thinkers , col - lectively entitled `` Literary Hearthstones . ''

		The volumes are shapely 16mos , containing , with pre - face and index , some 320 liberally margined and clearly printed pages , and a liberal sprinkling of well - chosen illustrations .

		The bindings are pretty and appropriate , and while not strikingly ornate , they are enough so to suggest the gift-book .

		The au - thor 's treatment of her theme is popular , yet by no means merely '' gossippy '' or trifling .

		Her aim is to show what the subjects of her studies were , rather than what they did to portray them familiarly as men and women , rather than as members of the guild of authors .

		It is , more specifically , the domes - tic side , the '' Hearthstone '' side , of their lives that she chiefly delineates and how touching and es - sential this side was in the gentle , home-keeping
Cowper	PERSON	's case we all know .

		In fine , these pretty and unassuming books contain much pleasant and wholesome reading , and they form an exceptionally suitable Holiday gift of the modester sort .

		This season 's addition to the pretty and tiny volumes of the '' Thumb-Nail Series '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , comprises `` Meditations of
Marcus Aurelius	PERSON	, '' selected and translated by Mr.
Benjamin E. Smith	PERSON	; and `` Rip Van
Winkle	PERSON	and the Legend of Sleepy Hollow '' -LRB- together in one volume -RRB- , with an Intro - duction by the public 's good friend and sterling entertainer , Mr.
Joseph Jefferson	PERSON	.

		The first-named volume is a really delectable little casket of gems the miniature embodiment of a specially happy thought for which we are indebted , we presume , to its judicious and scholarly editor .

		Mr.
Smith	PERSON	's version is unusually easy and fluent accurate and scholarly , yet a suitable one for popular reading .

		The tinted double frontispiece shows both sides of an old coin bearing the head of this noblest of all wearers of the Imperial purple in profile .

		The Irving volume is also a pretty one outwardly , with its tinted title-page , and frontispiece showing the pathetic figure of the returned sleeper of the
Catskills	LOCATION	.

		Under the new title , `` Historic Mansions and Highways around
Boston	LOCATION	, ''
Messrs. Little	PERSON	,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	issue a revised edition of Mr.
Samuel Adams Drake	PERSON	's useful and exhaustive local guide-book orig - inally entitled '' Old Landmarks and Historic Fields of Middlesex . ''

		In its revised form the book is , for the modern reader , a great improvement on its original , the practical value of which had become impaired through changes wrought by time and municipal progress , on the face of the storied dis - trict described .

		With a view of making the descrip - tions in the volume correspond with present condi - tions , the old places have been revisited , and , where necessary , redescribed .

		An added feature of import - ance is the very interesting illustrations , comprising twenty-two full-page plates and a liberal number of text cuts on wood .

		The pictures add much to the usefulness and attractiveness of the book , which forms an excellent guide to this region so rich in historic shrines and landmarks .

		It is , as
Longfellow	LOCATION	wrote of it in the seventies , '' a perfect store-house of information . ''

		A novel , thoroughly artistic , and delightfully man - ufactured little book is Mr.
Ernest Seton-Thompson	PERSON	's '' The Trail of the Sandhill Stag '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		The story is a capital one a hunter 's yarn with an infusion of poetry , and a touching , finely conceived denouement .

		The hunter , in fact , as the tale ends , is so struck by the majesty , the pathetic mute ap - peal as a fellow-creature , as a dumb sharer in the common life that binds us to the lowest forms of it , of the noble beast that after years of fruitless track - ing stands at last helpless before the muzzle of his rifle , that he forbears to fire , and relinquishes for - ever the '' Trail of the Sandhill Stag . '' ''

		Go , now , '' he says , '' without fear of me .

		... I have learned 430 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, what Buddha learned .

		I shall never see you again . ''

		The author 's full-page drawings are charmingly and -LRB- from the naturalist 's point of view -RRB- faithfully done , and the tiny thumb-nail sketches deer-tracks , In - dian signs , bits of snowy landscape , etc. scattered , not too lavishly , on the margins have a good effect .

		To Mrs.
Grace Gallatin Seton-Thompson	ORGANIZATION	; is due the no small credit for the general design of the volume .

		Decidedly clever and '' catchy '' in its literary and material ground plan , as well as pictorial ly pleasing , is Mr.
James L. Ford	PERSON	's '' Cupid and the Footlights '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , with illustrations and decora - tions by Mr.
Archie Gunn	PERSON	.

		This unique piece of Christmas bric-a-brac rather baffles description ; and we advise the reader to examine it for himself .

		However , Mr.
Ford	PERSON	's story is told in a series of letters , telegrams , and press-clippings , given in fac - simile , what are supposed to be the original docu - ments being pasted to the leaves , in scrap-book fashion , of the flat 4 to volume .

		Mr. G nun 's full - page drawings are appropriately interspersed .

		Mr.
Ford	PERSON	's dramatis persona are a lot of sprightly and very `` up-to-date '' young people whose love affairs and notions of each other 's pursuits and identities get tangled up in an amusing way , and are finally unsnarled much to their own and the reader 's satis - faction .

		We get a glimpse of the gayer and slightly Bohemian side of
New York	LOCATION	life , and the letters of the stage-people are amusingly spiced with the argot of the fairer half of the '' profession . ''

		Mr.
Ford	PERSON	's touch is light and graceful , and he is evidently very much at home in the world whereof he writes .

		It is decidedly a publication that the finrde-si & cle young man and young woman should not overlook .

		The wide range and good quality of the extracts contained in the twin volumes `` In Friendship 's Name '' and `` What Makes A Friend '' -LRB-
Brentano	ORGANIZATION	's -RRB- , and the fine quality of their paper and typography , should commend them to seekers of gift-books who care little for gay bindings and showy pictorial attractions .

		Mr.
Volney Streamer	PERSON	is the compiler , and he has selected and strung bis pearls of thought on the prolific theme of friendship with unusual taste and judgment .

		The scope of selection is wide , ranging from the great masters of prose and verse , down to the lesser and more familiar lights of our own time who have contributed their mite of strik - ing thought or phrase concerning the sentiment that Montaigne styles '' the highest degree of perfection in society . ''

		These chastely manufactured volumes are bound in pliable covers of vellum , and will be found edifying to read and useful to refer to .

		The fine artistic fancy and skill of execution of Mr.
Walter Crane	PERSON	are well displayed in
Messrs. R. G. Badger & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's attractive Holiday publication entitled '' The Sirens Three . ''

		Script and decora - tions are printed in uniform light sepia on rather thick paper of medium smoothness .

		Mr.
Crane	PERSON	's work is quite elaborate , and is informed , we think , with a somewhat more serious and symbolical spirit than usual .

		At any rate it well repays close inspec - tion , and it makes the well-made volume containing it the choicest and most really artistic of the season 's more inexpensive publications .

		Books on stage folk are usually sure of their welcome ; and Mr.
Lewis C. Strang	PERSON	's '' Famous Actresses of the Day in
America	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
L. C. Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is one of those which will deserve it .

		Mr.
Strang	PERSON	modestly disclaims having secured '' any great amount of new matter '' regarding the careers of his thirty-one heroines , and acknowledges him - self a compiler and editor in so far as biographical details are concerned .

		His facts have been gleaned from newspapers and magazines in some cases from the actresses themselves .

		The sketches are necessarily brief -LRB- there are only 360 pages , index included , in the little volume -RRB- , and there is a modi - cum of criticism .

		Each sketch , however , suffices to inform the reader in a general way who its heroine is and whence she came , what are her best parts and what her salient characteristics .

		Mr.
Strang	PERSON	writes pleasantly and intelligently , and with due sympathy with his theme .

		There are twenty-five portraits , including those of Miss
Maude Adams	PERSON	,
Miss Marlowe	PERSON	,
Annie Russell	PERSON	,
Maxine Elliott	PERSON	,
Ada Rehan	LOCATION	,
Viola Allen	PERSON	,
Julia Arthur	PERSON	,
Effie Shannon	PERSON	,
Marie Burroughs	PERSON	,
May Robson	PERSON	, etc. .

		All are stage - favorites of to-day .

		The cover , in white and gold , is a notably dainty one .

		The points of interest described in Mr.
Charles Hemstreet	PERSON	's `` Nooks and Corners of Old
New York	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- lie in that tangled maze of streets and alleys that bewilder the provincial pilgrim to the lower and historic part of the
Island	LOCATION	of Man - hattan .

		Mr.
Hemstreet	PERSON	is clearly an oracle on the ancient history , actual , legendary , and topograph - ical , of this swarming and not always delectable district of
Gotham	LOCATION	, and his method of imparting information is terse and practical .

		The little work is a good one for the reader who wants to make the most , especially in the shrine-hunting way , of a ramble through the region treated .

		Mr.
Peixotto	PERSON	's pen-drawings are clever and instructive , and the book is decoratively bound .

		Mr.
Seumas MacManus	PERSON	's pretty volume of tales of Irish folk-lore , entitled `` In Chimney Corners '' -LRB-
Doubleday & McClure Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , has the right Celtic smack .

		There is just the least touch of the brogue indicated in the spelling , and the wit is genuine and as different from the article purveyed in the comic papers , and popularly thought to be Irish wit , as '' Mr.
Dooley	PERSON	's '' turn of speech and humor is from that of his bog-trotting ancestors .

		There are sixteen tales , all replete with the arch fun and art - less fancies of the quick-witted , nimble-tongued imaginative peasant of
Erin	PERSON	.

		Miss
Pamela Colinan Smith	PERSON	's bright-colored illustrations are highly deco - rative and sympathetic just the sort that Paddy '' himself would approve in their present setting .


Marion Harland	PERSON	's `` Some Colonial Homesteads and Their Stories '' is now followed by a kindred and companion volume entitled '' More Colonial Homesteads and Their Stories '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		The present work treats of such interesting and storied
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 431 old mansions as
Johnson Hall	PERSON	,
Johnstown	LOCATION	, N. Y. ; La Chaumiere Du Prairie , near
Lexington	LOCATION	,
Ky.	LOCATION	; the two
Schuyler Homesteads	PERSON	,
Albany	LOCATION	, N. Y. ; the
Carroll Homestead	ORGANIZATION	,
Maryland	LOCATION	;
Belmont Hall	PERSON	, near
Smyrna	LOCATION	,
Del.	LOCATION	;
Langdon	PERSON	and
Wentworth Homes	ORGANIZATION	,
Portsmouth	LOCATION	, N. H. ; etc. .

		The author has in each case visited the seat described , and has spared no pains in making minute and pers6nal research into its history and archives .

		The book has a certain value as a chronicle of Colonial times and manners , and its attractive pictorial features and handsome appearance generally make it a suitable gift-book .

		There are eighty illustrations , comprising views of the homes described , portraits , coats-of-arms , his - toric apartments , pieces of Colonial furniture , etc. . ''

		The Romance of Our Ancient Churches '' -LRB-
Dut	PERSON	- ton -RRB- is an account , sympathetically written , of the earlier structures of
Great Britain	LOCATION	erected for ecclesiastical purposes , by Miss
Sarah Wilson	PERSON	, with an abundance of illustrations by Mr.
Alexander Ansted	PERSON	.

		The churches dealt with are rather the smaller parish houses of worship than the well - known cathedrals ; but the flavor of romance and antiquity is none the less strong .

		It is a matter of surprise to find so many
Saxon	PERSON	foundations still surviving as meeting-places for the faithful , and it shows the strength of the hold the old church has on the English heart .

		`` For Thee Alone '' -LRB-
Dana Estes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the melting , if not very explicit , title of an anthology of love-poems compiled by
Miss Grace Hartshorne	ORGANIZATION	.

		Miss
Hartshorne	PERSON	has aimed '' to present a selection of the best poems of love and lovers in the English lan - guage , as well as a few notable translations . ''

		In this aim she appears to us to have succeeded very well indeed , her list of poets and titles displaying due refinement as well as catholicity of taste .

		The older masters of verse are suitably represented , and there is a liberal sprinkling of the later and the humbler poets Mr.
Whitcomb Riley	PERSON	,
Miss Thaxter	PERSON	,
Phoebe Gary	PERSON	, Mr.
Samuel Minturn Peck	PERSON	,
Miss Thomas	LOCATION	, etc. .

		The volume is a small one , -LRB- 283 pp . -RRB-

		, and seems especially so when we consider the wide field of selection from which its contents are culled .

		It is a notably pretty and dainty one outwardly , well printed , and delicately bound in pale blue with cover ornament in lavender and sea-green .

		A rather effec - tive and original feature is the sixteen illustrations consisting of half-tone reproductions of paintings by artists mostly modern
Alma Tadema	PERSON	,
Edouard Bisson	PERSON	,
Tito Conti	PERSON	,
W. Menzler	PERSON	,
N. Sichel	PERSON	,
F. Andreotti	PERSON	, etc. .

		The connection of pictures with text is of course rather vague and fanciful ; but they serve the end of beautifying the book and making it an attractive and a suitable one for a gift .

		Another attractive , but in range of authors some - what less comprehensive , anthology of poems of love is entitled '' For Love 's Sweet Sake '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The editor is Mr.
G. Hembert Westley	PERSON	, and his selections in the present volume evince the same good taste shown in its predecessor and com - panion , '' Because I Love You . ''

		Mr.
Westley	PERSON	apparently inclines , as a compiler at least , to the more modern and the more easily appreciated poets ; and we should say that as a particularly '' fetching '' gift-book the young man in search of a Christmas token for the object of his affections will scarcely find anything better or more eloquent of the state of his heart and the seriousness of his '' intentions '' than this book of Mr.
Westley	PERSON	's .

		The essential fact that ''
Barkis	PERSON	is willin ' '' lurks in its very title .

		The text is clearly printed on moderately glazed paper , and there is a sprinkling of illustrations , full-page and marginal .

		The chaste binding of white , light-blue , and gold calls for special praise . ''

		Historic Towns of the
Middle States	LOCATION	, '' which forms Volume II .

		of the Messrs.
Putnams	PERSON	' useful '' American Historic Towns '' series , presents mono - graphs on
Albany	LOCATION	,
Saratoga	LOCATION	,
Schenectady	LOCATION	, New - burgh ,
Tarrytown	LOCATION	,
Brooklyn	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	,
Buffalo	LOCATION	,
Pittsburgh	LOCATION	,
Philadelphia	LOCATION	,
Princeton	LOCATION	,
Wilmington	LOCATION	.

		The general Introduction is by Dr.
Albert Shaw	PERSON	, who points out some interesting special facts in the early history and colonization of the
Middle States	LOCATION	, notably the mixed and cosmopolitan character of their original population , which served to differen - tiate them pretty sharply from the other two sec - tions , and to make them , as it were , a useful buffer between the morally and socially rather antagon - istic groups of
New England States	LOCATION	and
Southern States	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
Shaw	PERSON	's observations are interesting , and we should like to see them more fully devel - oped .

		The several authors have made the most of the limited space at their disposal , and the volume is both readable aud instructive .

		It is handsomely printed and contains over 150 illustrations . ''

		Shakespeare 's Sonnets '' are obviously and not unpleasingly exploited for pictorial and decorative purposes by Mr.
Henry Ospovat	PERSON	, in the square little volume of them published by Mr.
John Lane	PERSON	.

		The spirit of pre-Raphaelitism has entered Mr.
Ospovat	PERSON	to some extent , and his bold wood-cuts are quite in the neo-mediaeval , church-window style of
Morris	PERSON	and the rest .

		The full page plates , of which there are a dozen or so , recall very forcibly the work of the brothers
Rhead	ORGANIZATION	, which was strongly in evidence last season .

		The text is handsomely printed on rather thick cream-tinted paper , and the cover is of buff and gold .

		The book is artistic , and should form an unexceptionable gift .

		For a low-priced yet sound and tasteful gift-book , nothing better could be selected than a volume of the `` Copley Series '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , which com - prises '' Abbe * Constantin , '' Kipling 's ''
Barrack	PERSON	- Room Ballads , '' ''
Cranford	LOCATION	, '' ''
Evangeline	PERSON	, '' '' Hia - watha , '' '' The
House	ORGANIZATION	of the Seven Gables , '' Mere - dith 's ''
Lucille	PERSON	, '' and
Curtis	PERSON	's ''
Prue	PERSON	and I. '' The text is printed on good deckle-edge paper with lib - eral margins , and the bindings show a notably tasteful design in dark - green with floriated gold borders .

		The colored illustrations have a pleasing effect , and , altogether , the volumes must be pro- nounced of marvellously good quality , considering the low price asked for them .

		432 THE DIAJL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	BOOKS FOR
THK	ORGANIZATION	YOUNG .

		L First of all the reflections we children of a larger growth are likely to have on looking over the long lists of books for the young is the great number of the better books .

		While there are quite as many of the other sort as there used to be , the enormous increase in the number of volumes in - tended for the oncoming generation is made up from tales and picture-books of a sort wholly unknown thirty years ago .

		With this goes a consciousness of many world-movements , all the noisier ones , in fact , the echoes of which come back from the children 's world .

		War is dominant in their reading matter , almost to the exclusion of the healthier excitement of travel and ad - venture .

		Historical tales are evidently popular with the youngsters , as with their elders ; and of all the various kinds of these , topics taken from colonial days are most in vogue .

		Just as the man of complex civili - zation turns most lovingly to nature , so the American who is leaving the simplicity of his national life behind him harks back to the more natural days when the na - tion was still in swaddling clothes .

		But one difference is to be noted : the gentler sex is said to dominate the fiction for the adult reading population , and the novel which makes no appeal to womankind is said to be fore - doomed .

		Among these works for children and youth , on the contrary , boys ' books are greatly in the majority .

		It may be that girls like boys ' books better than those originally intended for themselves , while girls ' books make no corresponding appeal to their brothers ; still , a more likely solution comes to the same end , in the assumption that here too the little woman is doing the work of the little man , as in so many other things in real life .

		Stories of school and college are numerous and wholesome .

		``
Stalky & Co.	ORGANIZATION	'' -LRB- Double - < md college .

		d & y -RRB- , from the pen of Mr.
Rudyard Kip	PERSON	- ling , is the sincerest of these , since it goes to the pains of showing the boy as he is rather than the boy as his parents would have him .

		The ignoring of the evolu - tionary idea that the individual repeats in himself the history of the race is one of the troubles with most children 's reading matter , as anyone may prove who will go back to the ''
Eric	PERSON	, or Little by Little '' of
Canon Farrar	ORGANIZATION	, which Stalky and his companions so detest .

		English schools are healthy in sentiment , and give the youthful savage scope for his savagery , as in the present instance ; and the fact that it contains an autobiography of the author as a lad heightens the value of it .

		`` The Adventures of a Freshman '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is written by Mr.
Jesse Lynch Williams	PERSON	to tell what may befall a healthy young countryman during his first year at
Princeton	LOCATION	, proving that boys gain by temptations , if they are the right kind of boys `` The Half Back '' -LRB- Apple - ton -RRB- , by Mr.
Ralph H. Harbour	PERSON	, is a tale of a fitting school and of the freshman year in
Harvard	LOCATION	, thinly disguised as ``
Harwell	PERSON	. ''

		Similarly , `` Ward Hill at College '' -LRB-
A. J. Rowland	PERSON	-RRB- , by Dr.
Everett T. Tomlin	PERSON	- son , deals with life in
Rutgers	LOCATION	, the name of that re - spectable foundation being sufficiently apparent in the anagram `` Tegrus . ''

		All these have a lot of Rugby football in them , while Mr.
Harbour	PERSON	's volume treats of golf as well `` Cattle Ranch to College '' -LRB-
Doubleday	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is by Mr.
Russell Doubleday	PERSON	, and portrays a boy too busy earning an honest living to go in for athletics , though he wins a bicycle race at just the right time .

		Tain of var and action .

		Mr.
Rupert Hughes	PERSON	's `` The Dozen from Lakerim '' -LRB- Century -RRB- is almost exclusively athletic , with more of track and team events to distinguish it from its fellows .

		There is a thesis underlying these stories of the ^ J * at 8cbo l and .

		oo ^ S '' .

		abl - v -LRB- it '' f ended by all these writers except Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	, to the effect that athletics increase the capacity for school work , and eminence in both is attained quite as readily as eminence in either .

		Yet the books which deal with girls in school and college show nothing of this tendency , for all the woman 's athletics and golfing .

		Miss
Frances Freiot Gilbert	PERSON	, in `` The Annals of My College Life '' -LRB- Lee -RRB- , provides an illustrated blank - book -LRB- to use a seeming paradox -RRB- wherein , as she says , girls may record the '' bright features of student days . ''

		She provides for '' My Arrival , '' '' My Chums , '' '' My Spreads , '' and the like , but not for '' My Athletic Suc - cesses . ''

		In ''
Beck	PERSON	's Fortune '' -LRB- Lee -RRB- ,
Miss Adele E. Thompson	PERSON	turns the interest attaching to her school - girl in romantic directions , the story being both strong and wholesome .

		And in `` The Boys and Girls of Brantham '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Miss
Evelyn Ray	PERSON	- mond depicts a coeducational military academy in which both sexes drill with fervor , but fails to make athletes of either her boys or girls .

		The book , for all its incipient militarism , with all our American girls po - tential
Molly Starks	PERSON	, is exciting ; a crime and the sus - picions it gives rise to heightening the interest .

		How much work is done by men of letters to-day in comparison with an
earlier day	TIME	, illustrating the high pressure under which we moderns have to work , is best proved by the new publications of Mr.
George Alfred Henty	PERSON	, already suf - ficiently well known to have a class of literature , the '' Henty books , '' named from him .

		His methods are simple and natural , though he deals with the more ex - citing events of history , and therefore leans away from the normal always .

		This method consists in taking an historical episode of sufficient consequence ^ and weav - ing into it the fortunes of a boy .

		Three of his new books are published by Scribner , and of these '' Won by the Sword '' deals with the Thirty Years ' War , '' No Sur - render '' is concerned with the rising in La Vende * e , and '' A Roving Commission '' treats of the black insurrec - tion in
Hayti	LOCATION	.

		Another of his stories , `` The Brahmin 's Treasure , or Colonel
Thorndike	PERSON	's Secret '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , is more of a novel than the others , and for boys some - what older ; while a fifth volume bearing the Henty name is '' Yule Tide Yarns '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , in which Mr.
Henty	PERSON	furnishes the first story , its companions coming from pens as competent as those of Messrs.
Bloudelle	PERSON	- I ' .

		Mi-ton .


David Ker	PERSON	,
George Manville Fenn	PERSON	, and others .

		These novels are distinctly historical , and of value on that account , apart from the interesting manner in which they are set forth With them goes Mr.
Henry Newbolt	PERSON	's `` Stories from Froissart '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Unlike
Sidney Lanier	PERSON	in his `` Boy 's Froissart , '' Mr.
Newbolt	PERSON	takes most of his narrative directly from the pages of Lord
Berners	PERSON	's great translation , though it is greatly abridged , even in comparison with the other . ''

		The Story of
Magellan	ORGANIZATION	'' -LRB-
Appleton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- of Mr.
Hezekiah Butterworth	PERSON	is pleasant to read , as anything dealing with a life so full of wonders must be .

		It has added interest at the present time because of the great navi - gator 's connection with the
Philippines	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Henry St. John	PERSON	uses Sir
Francis Drake	PERSON	in a similar manner in `` The Voyage of the Avenger '' -LRB-
L. C. Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which has to do with the Spanish Inquisition and other
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 433 matters of more or less fascination Mrs.

America	LOCATION	for a time to follow a young French-English-Scotchman , ''
Gavin Hamilton	PERSON	'' -LRB- Har - per -RRB- , through the wars between
Maria Theresa	PERSON	and
Frederick the Great	ORGANIZATION	.

		It makes excellent reading So does Mr.
O. V. Caine	PERSON	's '' In the Year of
Waterloo	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
A. I. Bradley	PERSON	-RRB- , a book of good fighting , opening with the somewhat usual `` sound of revelry by night . ''

		American The books which deal with the past of hittory to tht
America	LOCATION	, from days very remote to those Revolution .

		quite recent , are well nigh innumerable .

		`` The Treasure Ship '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- , also by Mr.
Heze	PERSON	- kiah
Butterworth	PERSON	, has to do with Sir
William Phipps	PERSON	and his lucky find -LRB- which , like a number of other things worth having , was not so much luck as good sense -RRB- and the American regicides .

		`` The Boys of Scrooby '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Miss
Ruth Hall	PERSON	, goes back to an earlier period still , having to do with Captain
John Smith	PERSON	first , and then with the Mayflower '' Fife and Drum at Louisbourg '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a pleasant story of a pair of Yankee twins during the French War , by Mr.

Captivity	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , the third of the '' Young Puritan '' series written by Mrs.
Mary P. Wells Smith	PERSON	, treats of the fortunes of Prudence
Ellis	PERSON	and Submit
Carter	PERSON	, who were carried away from
Hadley	PERSON	in
King Philip	LOCATION	's war .

		Another tale of
King Philip	LOCATION	's war is Mr.
Edward S. Ellis	PERSON	's `` Uncrowning a King '' -LRB-
Penn Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The hero does wonders , but modern sympathy goes out to the unfortunate Philip nevertheless .

		Coming down to Revolutionary times , Mr.
Elbridge S. Brooks	PERSON	makes a very good book indeed of '' In Blue and '' White '' -LRB-
Lothrop	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which has to do with a member of General
Washington	LOCATION	's Life-Guard . ''

		A Jersey Boy in the Revolution '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , by Dr.
Everett T. Tomlinson	PERSON	, reminds us that
New Jersey	LOCATION	was a scene of constant struggle during the earlier days of our inde - pendence , and is correspondingly engrossing to those who like war 's alarums Colonel
Charles Ledyard Norton	PERSON	strikes the note we used not to hear at all , in '' The Queen 's Rangers '' -LRB-

Britain	LOCATION	in
New York	LOCATION	, and later desert to the patriot cause '' The Minute Boys of Bunker Hill '' -LRB-
Dana Estes	PERSON	-RRB- is by Mr.
Edward Stratemeyer	PERSON	, a slight but not uninteresting tale ; and `` A Revolutionary Maid '' -LRB-
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Miss
Amy E. Blanchard	PERSON	, begins in
New York	LOCATION	, when the old statue on the Battery was pulled down by the
Liberty Boys	ORGANIZATION	, and goes through

		It has a pleasant little romance woven in it . ''

		On Fighting Decks in

		Estes -RRB- is bv Mr ' F - H -
Costello	PERSON	, and takes us down to the second war for independ - ence .

		The hero of the book is in sufficiently good luck to be on the '' Constitution '' under
Commodore Hull	PERSON	when she meets the '' Guerrie 're , '' and on the same gal - lant ship under
Commodore Bainbridge	ORGANIZATION	when she met the ''
Java	LOCATION	. ''

		It is good reading ''
Midshipman Stuart	PERSON	, or The Last Cruise of the Essex '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- could be made more realistic by the use of less end-of - the-century slang , and it is not as well-told a narrative as others of Mr.
Kirk Munroe	PERSON	's '' Captain Tom the Privateersman '' -LRB-
Dana Estes	PERSON	-RRB- is by Mr.
James Otis	PERSON	, aud sets forth the adventures of a boy on the brig `` Chasseur , '' which was one of the best fighting ships
America	LOCATION	ever sailed under her flag , and abundantly deserving all the recognition possible .

		The Civil War shows somewhat desultorily in ''
Henry	PERSON	in the War , or The Model Volunteer '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by General
O. O. Howard	PERSON	.

		It is a sequel to his former book for boys , and contains an interesting glance at West Point in a day now remote A semi-historical book relating to the Rebellion is `` On General
Thomas	PERSON	's Staff '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , the second of the sort from the pen of Mr.
Byron A. Dunn	PERSON	.

		It is undoubtedly readable , and con - tains some spirited pictures of events among our fight - ing armies in the great
Southwest	LOCATION	'' An Undivided Union '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the last new publication which will ever bear the name of ''
Oliver Optic	PERSON	, '' the late
William T. Adams	PERSON	, though it owes its completion to Mr.
Edward Stratemeyer	PERSON	, who has evidently made a study of his predecessor 's methods , since he follows them closely in his original books as well as in this .

		It is a tale of
Kentucky	LOCATION	fighting , ending with
Chicka	LOCATION	- mauga , and abounds in the sort of incident which won Mr.
Adams	PERSON	a sale of two million volumes for his vari - ous books , a sale which shows no signs of abatement .

		From
Cuba	LOCATION	The war with
Spain	LOCATION	and associated events to the is not the mainspring of as much action in PMippintt .

		this sort of reading-matter as it was a year ago .

		`` Forward March ! ''

		-LRB- Harper -RRB- is a well-told tale of deeds about
Santiago	LOCATION	, by Mr.
Kirk Munroe	PERSON	, in which the Rough Riders appear for the sixth or seventh time in books '' Cleared for Action '' -LRB-
Dutton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Willis Boyd Allen	PERSON	, has to do with the
navy	ORGANIZATION	, and is also worth reading Mr.
James Otis	PERSON	adds two slender volumes to his '' Stories of American History '' -LRB-
Dana Estes	PERSON	-RRB- with '' Off
Santiago	LOCATION	with
Sampson	PERSON	'' and '' When Dewey Came to
Manila	LOCATION	. ''

		Necessarily , the young men in the former book were not on the ''
New York	LOCATION	, '' for they contrived to take part in the sea-fight of
July third	DATE	, and the father of one of them was on the ''
Brooklyn	LOCATION	. ''

		Mr.
Rossiter Johnson	PERSON	prepares an excellent account of Admiral
Dewey	PERSON	, both as a young man on the Missis - sippi and in his later exploits , with the title of '' The Hero of
Manila	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		It is profusely illus - trated .

		`` Two American Boys in
Hawaii	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Dana Estes	PERSON	-RRB- leads up to the actual scenes of annexation in
Honolulu	LOCATION	, and Mr.
G. Waldo Browne	PERSON	tells the story convincingly and well .

		The same author also goes back to the struggle between
Massachusetts	LOCATION	and
New Hampshire	LOCATION	for the debatable ground between them in
1740	DATE	and the succeeding years , and `` The Woodranger '' -LRB- Page -RRB- is the pleasing and instructive result .

		The indefatigable Mr.
Stratemeyer	PERSON	brings his '' Old Glory '' series down to date with '' Under
Otis	PERSON	in
the Philippines	LOCATION	, or a Young Officer in the Tropics '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , in which Americans have the melancholy pleasure of reading of the undoubted bravery of their soldiers exhibited in a war with men fighting for liberty .

		Finally , a tolerably complete survey of our greatness in men of many kinds appears in the brief and admirably designed series of '' Historic Americans '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr.
Eldridge S. Brooks	PERSON	.

		.

		It seems to be generally true that women Invention and do not e storieg o f fighting , so that all aucovery .

		.

		, ' > . ''

		the tales or war just enumerated are not intended for girls , unless these are so much nearer barbarism that their taste for bloody scenes or bloody deeds is not yet effaced .

		It is to be noted generally , however , that the real horrors of war , the inevitable facts which make it , as General
Sherman	PERSON	said , '' hell , '' are glossed over by all the writers mentioned , and only its splendors , as set apart from its horrors , are permitted to appear .

		Even in the tales of the Revolution , when 434 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, the American cause was just and aided in the causa of human freedom , there is a tendency to minimize the justice of the cause in favor of the glory of mere courage on the scene of battle afloat or ashore .

		This must ap - peal to the lower instincts of boys ; and we like to think that the girls , at least , have no share in it .

		But the rest of the books for boys are for the most part whole - some and hearty , when they are not most interestingly instructive .

		In this last class , `` The Boy 's Book of Inventions '' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- , by Mr.
Ray Stannard Baker	PERSON	, must be given very high rank indeed , and it is difficult to imagine anyone who will not be fascinated by the wonders it describes Also dealing with mechanics and its kindred topics is '
Dorsey	PERSON	, the Young Inventor '' -LRB-
Fords	ORGANIZATION	,
Howard & Hulbert	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Edward S. Ellis	PERSON	.

		The author makes use of the boy 's genius to pay off a mortgage , which is not particularly original with him , but makes the book a desirable one nevertheless .

		`` The Young BOM '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr.
Edward William Thompson	PERSON	, also treats of some engineering feats , and is a pleasant account of difficulties overcome .

		Among the few books of travels in the usual sense of the word is Mr.
Paul Du Chaillu	PERSON	's `` The Land of the Long Night '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		This deals with experiences , some of them downright hardships , in the Scandinavian peninsula , and has the intimate knowledge of children 's tastes and fancies which characterize this writer 's earlier works .

		Another tale of life in high latitudes is the '' Winter Adventures of Three Boys in the Great Lone Land '' -LRB-
Eaton & Mains	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Egerton R. Young	PERSON	.

		The land in question is Labrador , and the
Hudson Bay Company	ORGANIZATION	's men provide the other persons of the story .

		A third volume from the busy pen of Dr.
Everett T. Tomlinson	PERSON	is '' Camping on the
St. Lawrence	LOCATION	, or On the Trail of the Early Discoverers '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		In the last vacation before entering college , four boys go into the wilderness which the French had passed through cen - turies before , and have the sort of time which men try to have when they go off camping . ''

		To
Alaska	LOCATION	for Gold '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- deals with the recent dis - coveries of precious metals along the Yukon , and Mr.
Stratemeyer	PERSON	, though be gives his young men consider - ably better fortune than most of the prospectors have had in the
Klondike	LOCATION	, still paints the difficulties of that remote region .

		Hunting , rather than travel , makes up the argument in `` Grant Burton the Runaway '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , wherein Mr.
W. Gordon Parker	PERSON	carries on the adventures of the boys he introduced his readers to last year , with some additions .

		The story has a fine manly tone Another book devoted to the search for gold , in the
Rocky Mountains	LOCATION	this time , is '' The Treas - ure of Mushroom Rock '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , by Mr.
Sid ford F. Hamp	PERSON	.

		And still another is '' The Young Goldseekers '' -LRB-
Penn Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Edward S. Ellis	PERSON	,
Alaska	LOCATION	being the scene of the treasure hunting .

		How easy it is to find the end of the rainbow in books !

		More stories than one have been woven of ton * ?

Victoria Cross	ORGANIZATION	, and many more will continue to be told of the deeds of valor which it rewards . ''

		Tom
Graham	PERSON	,
V.C.	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Nel - son -RRB- , by Mr.
William Johnson	PERSON	, is the latest of these , and tells us how Tom was able to distinguish himself in the Afghan war to his heart 's content ''
Jack	PERSON	the Young Ranchman '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , from the pen of Mr.
William Bird Grinnell	PERSON	, is a pleasant medley of Indians ,
Rocky Mountains	LOCATION	, and boys on a ranch , with adventure and enterprise apparent on every page .

		A serious accident to one of `` The Boys of Marniton I ` raine '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Miss
Gertrude Smith	PERSON	, and the good that eventually Hows from it , make excellent reading ; while '' The Voyage of the Pulo Way '' -LRB-
Fenno	PERSON	-RRB- is as sen - sational as Mr.
Carlton Dawe	PERSON	knows how to make a boy 's book , with piracy and fighting around the
Philip	LOCATION	- pine islands among its incidents .

		A curious mingling of unusual information and mishap is '' The Golden Talis - man '' -LRB-
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
H. Phelps Whitntanh	PERSON	.

		It con - tains an account of a young captive who supplies a scentless kingdom with all manner of agreeable per - fumes , to the delight of all concerned .

		`` Captain Kodak '' -LRB- Lothrop -RRB- is a camera story , and the proficiency of Mr.
Alexander Black	PERSON	, its author , is shown by the illustrations reproducing photographs he has taken .

		It is what boys with a tendency for picture-making will ask for .

		Mr.
William Drysdale	PERSON	has done a difficult thing very well in his '' Helps for Ambitious Boys '' -LRB-
Crowell	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		He takes up various handicrafts successively , pointing out their respective merits , adds to it accounts of the learned professions so called , and produces a book which will be a real assistance to boys and their parents both : a thing frequently attempted and seldom carried out to anything like a successful conclusion .

		What a pleasant picture of a lad 's happi - 68t d * 7 * in
Scotland	LOCATION	Mr > S - R -
Crockett	PERSON	gives in '' Kit
Kennedy	LOCATION	, Country Boy '' -LRB- Harper -RRB- , returning to an earlier -LRB- and better -RRB- manner t And the truths in his pages , which give a man that curious start , as if he had renewed his youth for a mo - ment , are told in another form , of American boys in a Western country town , by Mr.
William Allen White	PERSON	in `` The Court of Boyville '' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- .

		Mr.
White	PERSON	's boys do not get as old as Kit , and they are correspond - ingly free from the finalities ; but they are all the more real .

		Mr.
Orson Lowell	PERSON	's illustrations in the American book are just what is needed to finish the picture .

		A book which every boy can read to his profit , in more senses than one , is Mr.
William O. Stoddard	PERSON	's '' I ` lrio the Jarl '' -LRB-
Eaton & Mains	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Daring , but not improb - able , is the conception that the penitent thief was a viking from the north ; and the book has real merit .

		Of an older fashion is Mr.
Harry Castlemon	PERSON	's '' The White Beaver '' -LRB-
Coates	PERSON	-RRB- , where there are crimes and retributions galore .

		With this goes another long familar name , that of Mr.
Horatio Alger , Jr.	PERSON	, with `` Rupert 's Ambition '' -LRB-
Coates	PERSON	-RRB- , in which everything happens at precisely the right moment , in precisely the manner in which everything fails to happen in real life Another boy who wins his way up from straitened circum - stances is the hero of '' The Bishop 's Shadow '' -LRB-
Revell	PERSON	-RRB- , the bishop being the late
Phillips Brooks	PERSON	, of glorious and saintly memory .

		If there is anything which ought to make a small boy proud , it is the manner in which other small boys wage successful warfare with a tribe of red Indians in war-paint , in the pages of Mr.
Ed	PERSON	- ward
S. Ellis	PERSON	's '' Iron Heart , Chief of the Iroquois '' -LRB-
Coates	PERSON	-RRB- .

		It is really worth while .

		`` Three Times Three '' -LRB-
Revell	PERSON	-RRB- is a composite tale of a boy 's tempta - tions in a large city , written by many hands , including those of Mrs.
G. R. Alden	PERSON	,
Miss Faye Huntington	PERSON	, and others .

		It is moral .

		Mr.
Albert Bigelow Paine	PERSON	's latest book , *** `` The Beacon Prize Medals , and Other '' Stories '' -LRB-
Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , includes also the thrilling tale of happily averted accident , '' Out with the Tide . ''

		The short stories of which the volume is composed are intended for both boys and girls , and
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 435 they make this double appeal successfully .

		It is a curi - ous fact that boys in stories always gain by being asso - ciated with other boys ' sisters , so far as gentleness and kindliness are concerned '' The Fugitive '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- of Mr.
John R. Spears	PERSON	is an instance of a contrary sort , showing all the assorted evils which come to a lad deprived of feminine influence .

		The book is melo - dramatic , and not up to the author 's own standard after the earlier chapters are passed .

		It has to do with slaves and with slave ships .

		Even more ambi - tious , and a book to be read with profit by young and old alike , is Mr.
Thomas Nelson	PERSON	Page 's ''
Santa Claus	LOCATION	's Partner '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , as pretty a bit of adventure in domestic circles as can well be written . ''

		The Young Master of Hyson Hall '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- ; by Mr.
Frank R. Stockton	PERSON	, reminds us that Mr.
Stockton	PERSON	's first suc - cesses were with children 's stories .

		This has less than usual of the somewhat characteristic whimsicality of the author , and is none the worse on that account .

		Informed with the spirit of poetry , Mrs.
Maud Balling	PERSON	- ton Booth 's '' Sleepy Time Stories '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- are models of writing for the young , being wholly free from mawkishness , and much to be treasured . ''

		Uncle Remus '' might have inspired Mr.
Joel Chandler Har	PERSON	- ris 's '' Plantation Pageants '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , and all that made his first book world-famous enters into this last work of his .

		It is funny , and it is considerably more , by way of good measure .

		Mr.
Elbridge S. Brooks	PERSON	weaves the poet
Longfellow	PERSON	into his story of a vacation
summer	DATE	, '' On Wood Cove Island '' -LRB-
Penn Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , making him the centre of interest to a number of little people .

		In a somewhat similar fashion
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	is woven into `` Under the Tamaracks '' -LRB-
Penn	LOCATION	-RRB- , also by Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	.

		The story was popular several years ago .

		Of books more distinctly for girls , none About girls could be more Delightful reading than andforthem .

England	LOCATION	the merrier for her presence . ''

		My Lady Frivol '' -LRB-

Rosa Nouchette Carey	PERSON	, is for girls almost grown up , and is almost a full-fledged English novel .

		`` Under the Cactus Flag '' -LRB-

Nora Archibald Smith	PERSON	, tells of a young American girl who went to teach school in

Amanda M. Douglas	PERSON	pub - lishes two books -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , one of them telling of '' A Little Girl in
Old Philadelphia	LOCATION	, '' as a com - panion to her former book about a little girl in old
New York	LOCATION	, and the other a sequel to a better-known series , '' The Heir of Sherburne . ''

		Both can be com - mended . ''

		Peggy '' -LRB-
Dana Estes	PERSON	-RRB- is a school-girl book by Miss
Laura E. Richards	PERSON	, and is filled with fun and frolic ; while `` Quicksilver Sue '' -LRB- Century -RRB- , by the same author , has a little of the pathos in it that made her '' Captain
January	DATE	'' so acceptable .

		Sweet little tales , short as sweet , make up the `` Little Fig Tree Stories '' -LRB-

Mary Hallock Foote	PERSON	.

		They make the bewintered Easterner long for the glories of the
California	LOCATION	climate . ''

		`` The Island Impossible '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,

		`` Harum-Scarum Joe '' -LRB-
Dana Estes	PERSON	-RRB- is slight and
Southern	ORGANIZATION	, by
Miss Will Allen Drumgoole	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is rather a story for little girls than boys , though written about a boy .

		The '' Wheat and Huckleberries '' -LRB-

Miss Carolyn Wells	LOCATION	has turned her manifest talents to excellent use in `` The Story of Betty '' -LRB- Century -RRB- .

Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- sets forth the adventures of some girl friends who spend a
summer	DATE	vacation together in the country .

		The author , Miss
Mary G. Darling	PERSON	, shows how their divergent characters act and react to the advantage of them all .

		A judicious blending of Italian art and American girlhood is the distinguishing feature of Miss
Deristhe L. Hoyt	PERSON	's ''
Barbara	PERSON	's
Heritage	ORGANIZATION	, or Young Americans among the Old Italian Masters '' -LRB-
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- If an ideal farm is lovely , so is Mrs.
C. F. Eraser	PERSON	's little book about one , called `` Strawberry Hill '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		When `` Wee Lucy 's Secret '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is said to be the fourth volume of '' Little Prudy 's Children '' series , everyone knows all about it .

		It is a pleasant thought that Sophie
May	DATE	-LRB- Miss
Clarke	PERSON	-RRB- can write as spontaneously for the grandchildren as she did long years ago for the grandmothers '' Sunbeams and Moonbeams '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- takes its name from two clubs , one of girls and one of boys , which Mrs.
Louise R. Baker	PERSON	brings into contrast , with interesting and sometimes laughable results .

		A happy combination of imagination and history makes '' The
House	ORGANIZATION	with Sixty Closets '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- of Mr.
Frank Samuel Child	PERSON	justify its sub-title of `` A
Christmas Story for Young Folks	ORGANIZATION	and Old Children . ''

		The pictures , unfortunately , detract from the illusion of the narrative .

		`` Little Miss Conceit '' -LRB-
Bradley	PERSON	-RRB- is by Miss
Elinor D. Adams	PERSON	.

		It is the useful account of a spoiled child 's becoming 436 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, for on unspoiled .

		Pictures by Miss
Bess Goe	PERSON	enhance the charm of a rather mature book for girls , Miss
Amy E. Blanchard	PERSON	's '' Miss Vanity '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The story is a sweet and wholesome one . ''

		Two Wyoming Girls '' -LRB-
Penn Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mrs.
Carrie L. Marshall	PERSON	, tells of life in the far West under discouragements and trials which are made right at last by womanly stead - fastness and courage '' My Lady Barefoot '' -LRB-
Penn Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mrs.
Evelyn Raymond	PERSON	, recounting the hardships and final success of a little backwoods woman , is really new in its scenery and episodes .

		Miss
Annie M. Barnes	PERSON	has a
Georgia	LOCATION	background for her `` Ferry Maid of the Chattahoochee '' -LRB-
Penn Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , in which a little girl succeeds in supporting a fam - ily by dint of great cheerfulness and much hard work .

		A combination of history and religion is `` A Maid of the First Century '' -LRB-
Penn Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mrs.
Lucy Foster Madison	PERSON	, following as it does a little mai - den from
Palestine	LOCATION	to
Rome	LOCATION	, and her speedy conversion to the new faith .

		Books , whether their charm lies in their text , their pictures , or both , seem to be - come epicene when told for the very young .

		It is this which gives most of them a little-boy-and-girl interest , rather than one peculiar to either sex taken singly . ''

		Told Under the Cherry Trees '' -LRB- Lee & Shep - ard -RRB- , gives Miss Grace Le Baron an opportunity to bring two orphans ,
Willie	PERSON	and
Miriam	PERSON	, together .

		Then
Willie	PERSON	goes off and grows up and gets rich in the most conventional manner .

		Its scene laid in the vicarage of a small English village , '' Rob and Kit '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by the author of '' Miss Toosey 's Mission , '' is a placid little tale , ending in a break-up and the coming of
Rob	ORGANIZATION	to
America	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
James Otis	PERSON	, who is as versa - tile as he is industrious , makes a very good story , in which old acquaintances appear , of '' Christmas at Deacon
Hackett	PERSON	's '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		It is bright without being forced '' King Pippin '' -LRB- Page -RRB- is a good little boy who is still not too good for his health .

		It is the last addition , by Mrs.
Gerard Ford	PERSON	, to the '' Gift Book '' series .

		Not a little people 's book , though there are little people in it , is '' The Wild Ruthvens '' -LRB- Page -RRB- , by Mr.
Curtis Yorke	PERSON	.

		They become tamer in the course of the narrative .

		In the '' Cosy Corner '' series -LRB- Page -RRB- , there are three volumes , one , '' Two Little Knights of
Kentucky	LOCATION	, '' by Miss
Annie Fellows Johnson	PERSON	, with a large bear in it ; another , `` Little King Da vie , '' is by Miss
Nellie Hellis	PERSON	, with a boy in a hospital who is almost too self-denying ; while the third is '' A Little Daughter of .

		Liberty , '' by Miss
Edith Robinson	PERSON	, in which the heroine is a little Revolutionary girl whose descendants , let us hope , are as zealous for freedom in
America	LOCATION	as she was '' A Pair of Pickles '' -LRB-
Bradley	PERSON	-RRB- tells of two Eng - lish children , one of them a Sir
Lionel	PERSON	, and is written by Mrs.
Evelyn Everett-Green	PERSON	.

		Stories of animals are numerous enough to form a category by themselves , and Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	's `` Red Book of Animal Stories '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- surely heads the list with its more or less mystical references to '' The Wuss , the
Azorkon	PERSON	, and the Pod . ''

		It is a collection of unusual creatures , and in its inventor 's happiest manner . ''

		Father Goose , His Book '' -LRB-
George M. Hill Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has its pages filled with animals and children by Mr.
William Wallace Denslow	PERSON	, Mr.
L. Frank Baum	PERSON	furnishing the merry jingles which accompany them .

		The book makes a field for itself , being quite of its own kind and immensely entertaining A Child 's Primer of Natural History ''
Indium	ORGANIZATION	and golliwoggi .

		-LRB-
Soribner	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has its comical drawings and equally comical verses from the same hand , that of Mr.
Oliver Herford	PERSON	.

		It is the sort of book grown-up people buy to give their children so they can read it themselves .

		Out of the ordinary sort is '' The Adventures of a Siberian Cub '' -LRB- Page -RRB- , translated from the Russian by M. Le * on
Golsch	PERSON	- 111:11111 , and plentifully supplied with pictures by Miss
Winifred Austin	PERSON	.

		It is a pleasant account of a little bear who attains his maturity in captivity Miss
Etheldred B. Barry	PERSON	's pitiful story , Little Tong 's Mis - sion '' -LRB-
Dana Estes	PERSON	-RRB- , is as pathetic as a little crippled boy can make it .

		Tong is the boy , but
Jeff	PERSON	, his dog , is almost as important in the story , and adds greatly to its value .

		The escape from zoological gardens of a parrot , and the results , make '' Madam Mary of the Zoo '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- one of Mrs.
Lily F. Wesselhoeft	PERSON	's most successful books for children .

		It is humorous , instructive , and interesting '' Bruno '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is Mr.
Byrd Spillman Dewey	PERSON	's narrative of a fine hunting dog , and a most excellent book for boys with pets or without them .

		The American Indian comes in for sym - pathetic treatment in children 's books , if nowhere else .

		`` Indian Child Life '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , with many entertaining and truthful pictures in both color and black-and-white by Mr.
Edwin Willard Doming	PERSON	, the reading matter by Mrs.
Therese O. Deming	PERSON	, is an excellent example of this . ''

		Docas , the Indian Boy of
Santa Clara	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Heath -RRB- , by Mrs.
Genevra Sisson Snedden	PERSON	, is another , being accompanied by more than a score of full-page pictures .

		Of another sort , since the Indians are used in caricature as illustrations for a parody of '' Hiawatha , '' is `` Our Indians , a Midnight Visit to the Great Somewhere-or-Other '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , sketches and hand-lettering being done by Mr.
L. D. Bradley	PERSON	.

		Other books filled with pictures for small children and their kinsfolk are not so numerous as in former years . ''

		Outside of Things , A Sky Book '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- has some astronomical verses done by Miss
Alice Ward Bailey	PERSON	, with more or less appropriate illus - trations by Miss
Annita Lyman Paine	PERSON	. ''

		The
Golli	PERSON	- wogg in War '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- is another of the books by the
Misses Upton	LOCATION	, funny enough for very small chil - dren , and indicating that the martial spirit has fairly invaded the kindergarten .

		Of the same sort is `` Gal - lant Little Patriots '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , with text by Miss
Mabel Humphrey	PERSON	and pictures by Miss
Maud Humphrey	PERSON	.

		It shows various babes in soldier and sailor uniform , potential enlargers of the empire we older ones shall leave them Two quaint translations from the Ger - man of
Wilhelm Busch	PERSON	have been made by Mr.
Charles T. Brooks	PERSON	, '' Plish and Plum '' and '' Max and Maurice '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The pictures are as old-fash - ioned and Teutonic as possible , and the heroes of the two stories very mischievous indeed .

		Of fairy tales there is no lack .

		Mr.
Charles J. Bellamy	PERSON	tells six delightful ones in his '' Return of the Fairies '' -LRB-
Little Folks Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and they have the real feeling of wonder and simplicity . ''

		Nannie 's Happy Child - hood '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mrs.
Caroline Leslie Field	PERSON	, is an every-day story , with fairies coming in by way of variety , to show how natural it all is after one under - stands it .

		With these are to be classed two re-publica - tions , '' Old-Fashioned Fairy Tales '' and '' Old French Fairy Tales '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , both being selec - tions from the tales of
Charles Perrault	PERSON	,
Madame D'Anlnoy	ORGANIZATION	, aud many more .

		They are plentifully illus -

		THE DIAL 437 trated .

		A new '' Mother Goose '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- has the advantage of being interpreted by the pencil of Mr.
F. Opper	PERSON	, who puts a new and most oddly modern aspect on the old rhymes .

		The book is as funny as a book can be , for the pictures exceed two hundred and fifty in number A new edition of the late
William Brighty Rand	PERSON	's '' Lilliput Lyrics '' -LRB-
John Lane	PERSON	-RRB- owes its undoubted fun to the spirited and delicious sketches of Mr.
Charles Robinson	PERSON	, quite as much as to the classical verses they interpret '' Alice in Wonder - land '' loses in one direction and gains in another with the substitution of pictures by
Blanche McManus	PERSON	-LRB- Mrs.
M. F. Mansfield	PERSON	-RRB- for those of Sir
John Tenniel	PERSON	.

		But
Messrs. Mansfield & Wessels	ORGANIZATION	have given it a presenta - tion quite worthy of its merits in every respect .

		Equally munificent is a new edition of
Hans Christian Andersen	PERSON	's '' Fairy Tales '' -LRB- Truslove ,
Hanson & Comba	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , for which Dr.
E. E. Hale	PERSON	has written an intro - duction and Miss

Winifred Green	PERSON	, and their '' Tales from Shakespeare '' -LRB- Truslove -RRB- , with an introduction by Mr.

Robert Bell	PERSON	.

		And there is a new edition called '' A Hundred Fables of JEsop '' -LRB-
John Lane	PERSON	-RRB- , for which Mr.
Kenneth Grahame	PERSON	has prepared a charming prefatory statement , the illus - trations being by Mr.
Percy J. Billinghurst	PERSON	.

		This follows the perfect English of Sir
Roger L'Estrange	PERSON	.

		The '' Tales of Languedoc '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , from the French of
Samuel Jacques Brun	PERSON	, is done by Mrs.
Harriet W. Preston	PERSON	, and is all that can be desired in its account , fully illustrated , of romance and history in that land of song and story . ''

		The Prince 's Story Book '' -LRB- Long - mans -RRB- is a companion to the '' Queen 's Story Book '' of Isat year , and , like it , is edited by Mr.
George Laurence Gomme	PERSON	.

		It deals with selections , taken from many sources old and new , all of which carry on the account of English kings . ''

		The Talking
Thrush	PERSON	and Other Tales from
India	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- is an excellent collection of fairy and folk stories from Hindustan , made by Mr.
W. Crooke	PERSON	, re-told by Mr.
W. H. D. Rouse	PERSON	, and beau - tifully illustrated by Mr.
W. H. Robinson	PERSON	.

		The tales are familiar in Europeanized forms .

		Of the same sort is '' Fairy Tales from Far
Japan	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Revell	PERSON	-RRB- , translated by Miss
Susan Ballard	PERSON	, with an introduction by Mrs.
Isabella L. Bishop	PERSON	, the illustrations being from the hands of native artists .

		The stories are fascinating .

		`` Tales of an Old Chateau '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- is an agglom - eration of French folk-lore stories , gathered by Miss
Margaret Bouvet	PERSON	, the different bits being pleasantly told .

		Following stories of the Iliad and Odyssey comes `` The Story of the ^ Eneid '' -LRB-
Penn Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Dr.
Edward Brooks	PERSON	.

		Virgil 's charm is , of course , un - translatable , but the effect here is seemly , as a whole .

		Anthologies , Deserving mention of a particular kind is new editions , '' The Listening Child '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , an and annuals .

		ant hology of verse , narrative and descrip - tive , and all the rest , done by Mrs.
Lucy W. Thacher	PERSON	, with a prefatory note by Colonel
T. W. Higginson	PERSON	.

		Nothing we know in English is more likely to give a child of impressionable age a downright love for the highest form of literary expression than the contents of this admirable volume , whether he listens to another 's reading or reads it for himself .

		There remain to be noted new editions of ''
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	'' and '' Swiss Family Robinson '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- ; the always welcome `` Chatterbox '' -LRB-
Dana Estes	PERSON	-RRB- ; the orthodox ``
Sunday	DATE	Reading for the Young '' -LRB-

		Mr.
Francis P. Harper	PERSON	is the American publisher of the sixth edition of '' Old English Plate , '' by Mr.
Wil	PERSON	- fred
Joseph Cripps	PERSON	.

		This work has for twenty years been a standard authority upon its subject , and in its present revision becomes more useful than ever .

		It contains over 2,600 facsimiles of plate marks and 123 illustrations of ancient pieces .

		Professor
G. R. Carpenter	PERSON	's '' Elements of Rhetoric and English Composition '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the revision and expansion of an earlier work having substantially the same title , and now withdrawn from circulation .

		A

Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Dr.
E. H. Lewis	PERSON	, is a text-book prepared for that edu - cational limbo which includes the upper grammar and lower high school grades .

		The recent vicissitudes in the affairs of
Messrs. Harper & Brothers of New York	ORGANIZATION	, which have caused general concern among the friends of that old and hon - orable house , have culminated in the formal transfer of the business to a trustee , under the conditions of a mortgage for a large sum held by
Messrs. J. Pierpont Morgan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, bankers .

		The trustee has appointed as agent Mr.
G. B. M. Harvey	PERSON	, proprietor of the '' North American Review , '' who has thus become the legal and actual manager of the Harper establishment .

		It is stated that this step was taken by mutual agreement , and with the full approval of the Messrs.
Harper	PERSON	, as being the best method of effecting a permanent readjust - ment of their affairs .

		Although the amount of their indebtedness is given as over
five millions of dollars	MONEY	, the assets are believed to materially exceed that sum , and with the fresh assistance , financial and administra - tive , which the house will receive , there will be no im - pairment of its credit or efficiency .

		The periodicals of the house will be continued , with the exception of '' The Round Table '' and '' Literature , '' which will , it is said , be discontinued ; and the general book publishing busi - ness will go on as before .

		The house of
Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	was founded nearly a century ago , and has from the first occupied a commanding and honorable position in the American publishing trade ; and it is greatly to be hoped that the present readjustment will mark the beginning of a new period of prosperity and usefulness .

Theodore Roosevelt	PERSON	. ''

		The , REVIEW OF REVIEWS does really important work because it gives not merely an epitome of what is going on in the world , but a chance to every man of whatever political creed , who writes seriously and deeply , to reach the classes of our people most interested in the vital government and social problems of our time .

		I know that through its columns views have been presented to me that I could not otherwise have access to : because all earnest and thoughtful men , no matter how widely their ideas diverge , are given free utterance in its columns '' SEVERAL hundred thousands of Americans find the AMERICAN MONTHLY REVIEW OF REVIEWS very useful and helpful reading .

		In the political year it becomes fairly necessary .

		In no presidential year will this be more true than in
1900	DATE	, with the many important problems created by the country 's new colonial duties .

		In Dr.
Shaw	PERSON	's editorial survey of the month , in the timely contributed features , in the departments reviewing the other maga - zines of the world , the alert reader finds each month a full and accurate presentation of the political news , with able discussions of the economic and social questions which are interesting everybody .

		The authoritative character sketches of the presidential candidates and other notable figures appear at the hour when public interest is greatest in these subjects .

		The portrayal of current history in the best caricatures of each month is not the least attractive of these many helps to a right understanding of one 's own times , and one 's own public duties .

		Each number is illustrated with nearly a hundred timely pictures .

		EXPERIMENTAL .

		For the purpose of showing what effect prices have on sales , we are putting on the market an edition of
Von Hoist	ORGANIZATION	's Constitutional and Political History of the
United States	LOCATION	AT LESS THAN ONE-HALF THE REGULAR PRICE .

		Best English cloth , gilt tops , large type , good paper , complete in eight volumes , PRICE ,
$ 12.00	MONEY	NET .

		THE History has been written with a broad understand ing of the influences that contributed to form the constitution , and have governed the political thought and growth of the coun - try .

		Political movements are traced to their origins with great care and acuteness , and no fact is relied upon until it is fully established .

		An impartial and generous spirit pervades the work .

		It is written without prejudice or foregone conclusions .

		This principle it is which gives the author freedom , and the fearlessness that has provoked in some quarters resistance to some scathing judgments , together with replies of varying character .

		But these criticisms and replies have but aided the sure growth of the history in favor with the scholar and the public .

		The day has gone by when the best American citizen demands limitless , reasonless praise of his institutions , and the time has come when he and they rely on and invite candid , judicial , plain statements , neither extenuating nor suppressing the truth .

		The time has come for such a history as Dr. von Hoist 's , and the value of the work is understood and keenly appreciated by all who have met it .

		A rare association of qualities has enabled Dr. von Hoist to investigate tirelessly , judge dispassionately and with great soberness of mind , and relate the story of our constitutional and political career with a clearness and vigor that separate his history entirely from the usual more or less prejudiced and perhaps dry studies of constitutional topics .

		The enthusiasm and conviction of the historian at once captivate the reader , and few , after beginning the history , will leave it without completing it .

		As a gallery of American statesmen , von Hoist 's history probably has no equal .

		The first volume of the history was , in a sense , eyed askance by the American public , who had come to look on foreign views of
America	LOCATION	as either bald praise or bald abuse , and were unprepared for a work of the most difficult sort , showing painstaking research and preparation , candor , keenness , comprehension of the American spirit and , above all , a frankness and fair - ness of treatment that made the history its own standard , and set the standard for future studies , complete or fragmentary , of
United States	LOCATION	history . '

		A masterpiece as to depth , clearness , impartiality , and scope .

		In these passing years , when teachers and writers are attempting to kindle new flames of patriotism in old and young hearts , this pro- duction is timely indeed . ''

		r I ^ HE letters to Mr.
Colvin	PERSON	or Mr.
Henley	PERSON	about his own writings , the point of view he 1 reveals when he tells
Henry James	PERSON	or
J. M. Barrie	PERSON	about their productions , the judg - ments he passes on Zola -LRB- whom he can barely endure -RRB- and
Paul Bourget	PERSON	-LRB- in whom , at least in as far as the ' Sensations d'ltalie ' are concerned , he delights -RRB- , all this throws light , as the saying goes , upon the genesis and evolution of his own books .

		But , we repeat , it is the man , not the author , that counts in these pages .

		The author is insistent enough to make such letters as we have cited above , with their vivid illustrations of his professional attitude , intensely significant , indispensable to the filling out of the writer 's portrait .

		But the great thing is ' the sum of virtues ' in himself , the great thing is the sweetness and force of char - acter which , as embalmed in these letters , would keep
Stevenson	PERSON	's name alive if every one of his studies in the art of fiction were forgotten . ''

		504 A QUESTION OF ETHICS .

		A passage in Mr.
Lecky	PERSON	's recent work , `` The Map of Life , '' has caused some little stir in ecclesiastical circles .

		The great historian of morals takes occasion to speak of a biog - raphy of the late
John Boyle O'Reilly	PERSON	, and of a eulogistic preface written for the book by no less distinguished a personage than
Cardinal Gibbons	ORGANIZATION	.

		This action of the eminent church - man is somewhat harshly characterized as be - ing a condonation of the crime committed in early manhood , which led to
O'Reilly	PERSON	's convic - tion and transportation to a penal colony .

		In reply to this criticism , the Cardinal contributes to the
London	LOCATION	'' Tablet '' the following state - ment : `` Assuming I was acquainted with the facts , Mr.
Lecky	PERSON	complained that I have not uttered a single word in condemnation of
O'Reilly	PERSON	's violation of his oath .

		I feel it due to myself and in the interests of truth to declare that till I read Mr.
Lecky	PERSON	's criticism I did not know
O'Reilly	PERSON	had ever been a Fenian or a British soldier , or had tried to seduce other soldiers from their allegiance .

		In fact , up to this moment I have never read a line of the biography for which I wrote an intro - duction , and I hope that the author of the life , if he comes across this letter , will not regard me as discour - teous to him for making this avowal . ''

		This statement is so remarkable that it de - serves more than passing attention , for it in - volves a question of the utmost importance to the ethics of literature .

		In the first place , and by way of preface , we wish to say that few men in the public life of
America	LOCATION	are deserving of the respect and ad - miration which are the just due of Cardinal
Gibbons	PERSON	.

		Not only as a leader of his own church , but also as a leader in that wider sphere which embraces all the activities that go to the making of good citizenship and the promotion of social health , the distinguished prelate of
Baltimore	LOCATION	has deserved well of his fellow-countrymen .

		Nor would we willingly speak harshly of
O'Reilly	PERSON	, who , as an adopted citizen of the
United States	LOCATION	, lived a blameless life , and won an enthusiastic following among the better elements of our society .

		But , hav - ing made all these reservations , the bare facts remain that -LRB- 1 -RRB-
O'Reilly	PERSON	was once guilty of an act for which no defense is possible , -LRB- 2 -RRB- that his friendly biographers have glossed over this act if they have not suppressed mention 480 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, of it altogether , and -LRB- 3 -RRB- that his ecclesiastical eulogist wrote the preface in question , upon his own admission , without knowledge of so essential an episode , and even without reading '' a line of the biography '' for which he thus became a sponsor .

		It is evident that the plea made by
Cardinal Gibbons	ORGANIZATION	in reply to Mr.
Lecky	PERSON	's criticism of - fers no real defense of the act concerned , and leaves him , if anything , in worse case than be - fore .

		The matter is very simple .

		A man whose calling is such that he is bound by it to lay special stress upon ethical considerations writes in eulogistic strain of a character upon which a dark blot has been fixed , and does not take reasonable pains to find out whether that character is deserving of unqualified praise .

		Added to this first count there is the second , that a man whose position gives unusual au - thority to his utterances is found willing to recommend to the public , by implication at least , a book which he confesses that he has never read .

		The first of these counts calls for no particular comment .

		The evidence is plain , and there can be but one judgment upon the duty involved and the admitted fact of its neglect .

		Upon the second count there may be some variety of opinion , for it opens a question which has many ramifications , and which comes peculiarly within the province of a journal devoted to the interests of liter - ature .

		The practice of `` introducing '' books and their authors to the public begins before the act of publication .

		Some obscure writer pre - pares a manuscript for the press , and casts about for a publisher .

		He is apt to entertain the delusion that his chances of a favorable hearing will be enhanced if he goes upon his quest armed with testimonials of some sort .

		With this idea in mind , he seeks out some re - putable person whose name is widely known more frequently a clergyman than anyone else plays at once upon the vanity and the good nature of his victim , and secures one of those vague and kindly letters with which editors and publishers are so familiar , and the sight of which makes them so weary .

		Having ob - tained these credentials , he submits his manu - script and awaits results .

		These depend , of course , almost solely upon the merits of what he has to offer , and not , as he fondly supposes , upon the good-will of the sponsor whom he has chosen for his work .

		Already we have in this practice the first appearance of the insin - cere professional '' introducer , '' for with some men the function is made almost a profession by frequency of performance .

		Up to this point , no particular harm is done , for editors and publishers are wary people , who have a cold-blooded way of remaining uninflu - enced by the warmest of '' introductions . ''

		It is only in the case of actual entry into print that the public becomes concerned with the plot , and the function of the '' introducer '' takes on a questionable ethical aspect .

		Here the publisher , no less than the writer , is im - plicated in a sort of confidence game , and the victim is now the unsophisticated general reader , who is not upon his guard as the publisher is in the initial stages , and with whom the aegis of a respected name really serves as a protec - tion and a commendation for some work that is as likely as not to be intrinsically worthless .

		Sometimes the imposition takes the shape of a prefatory chapter of commendation or eulogy , sometimes it assumes the more insidious form of a dedication , '' by personal permis - sion and with the greatest respect , '' to the eminent person selected , sometimes it is prac - ticed by the naive insertion of extracts from solicited testimonials , but in all cases there is the same attempt to create a favorable pre - possession by an adventitious appeal to some achieved reputation .

		The harm in all these devices is that the ap - proval given or implied is frequently lacking in sincerity .

		So flagrant an example of the abuse as that which furnishes the text for our present discussion is not common enough to be typical , but it shows to what an extreme the abuse may possibly be carried .

		We are will - ing to credit the `` introducer , '' as a rule , with some knowledge of the subject and some ex - amination of the book to which he lends his name , but even iu the majority of cases the task seems to be performed in a rather per - functory manner .

		And how the name of the victim is exploited !

		He may have contributed no more than a page or two of platitudinous generalization , but his name looms large upon the title-pages , and is boldly flaunted in the advertisements .

		And there are , unfortunately , too many men of reputable rank who are found willing , whether out of mere kindliness or in return for a payment of money , to allow their names to be so used as to product - a mislead - ing impression concerning the publications with which they are connected .

		The instance of
William Cullen Bryant	PERSON	is a conspicuous one that will occur to the memory of older readers .

		In the case of large collective enterprises , such
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 481 as a dictionary , an encyclopaedia , or a '' library of literature , '' the practice is growing more and more common to place some familiar name or collection of names in the forefront of the work in question , although these names represent little or none of the actual responsibility for its character .

		It is refreshing to read Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	's recent protest against this use of his name in connection with a recent Ameri - can enterprise .

		He says , substantially , that he was engaged to make a few extracts from
Scott	PERSON	for a `` library '' of selections from stand - ard literature , and that , to his surprise , his name is being widely and flamboyantly adver - tised as one of the editors of the work .

		Even the grosser supercheries litteraires , which
Dumas	PERSON	practiced with so magnificent an audacity , are not unknown in our own time , and represent but one step beyond the practices to which we have hitherto referred .

		It is an open secret among those having practical acquaint - ance with literary affairs that men who can not write at all sometimes achieve reputations as brilliant essayists .

		The desire to assemble notorieties in a table of contents has led more than one magazine editor to connive at the de - ception whereby some public man signs his name to a paper prepared for him by his lit - erary mercenary or his private secretary .

		The ambitions of politicians and actors and mem - bers of the professions to shine also in the sphere of literature has led to many an act of this sort , and will continue so to lead as long as the hirer and the hired are willing to make terms with each other , and the editor is willing to abet the deception .

		It is evident that the practices to which our remarks have been de - voted range all the way down the graduated scale that begins with what is barely question - able and ends with downright dishonesty .

		It is clearly unsafe to enter upon this path at all , lest one be tempted to step lower than was at first anticipated .

		The literary conscience should be at least as exacting as the commer - cial conscience , and those who derogate from the highest possible standard in ` these matters are sinning against a greater light than is set for the feet of men whose life is essentially one of action rather than of thought .

		`` THE Complete Poetical Works and Letters of
John Keats	PERSON	, '' with a prefatory memoir by Mr.
Horace E. Scudder	PERSON	, form a welcome addition to the ''

		COMMUNICA TIONS , ARNOLD AS AN ABIDING FORCE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAI , . -RRB-

		May I say through your columns with what pleasure and sympathy I read Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	's thoughtful plea for the permanent value of
Arnold	LOCATION	's writings , in your issue of
November 16	DATE	?

		Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	quotes for condemna - tion * and dissent from my `` Social Ideals in English Letters '' the phrase , '' Already we look back to Ar - nold 's strong and vivid work as belonging rather to his - tory than to the things that are . ''

		Taken alone , the phrase is , to be sure , sweeping enough , a clumsy and inadequate expression of what was in my mind ; but the whole trend of my treatment of
Arnold	LOCATION	was to bring into evidence , what it seems to me has been too much ignored , the remarkable breadth and solidity of his social criticism , its clearness of insight , and the curious prophetic quality it possesses .

		The '' succes de scan - dale '' of
Arnold	LOCATION	's theological work threw his social writings for a time into the shade ; but they have as - suredly an abiding interest and suggestiveness , and they are as fresh to many of us to-day as when they were written .

		At the same time , quite apart from anyone 's desire to '' better social conditions , '' a desire which assuredly should not affect literary judgments , is it not true as a matter of fact that the mood of men has changed since
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's day ?

		Our estimate of the relative value of various truths is simply a question of emphasis .

		Surely , I did not in my book depreciate the permanent worth or the genius of
Arnold	LOCATION	's predecessors ,
Carlyle	PERSON	and
Ruskin	PERSON	.

		I do not know whether they are among the immortals ; I do n't know whether Arnold is .

		No - body knows yet , or will know for at least several gen - erations .

		But while criticism refrains from judgment , heart and imagination , I am not ashamed to say , still owe allegiance to
Carlyle	LOCATION	and
Ruskin	PERSON	, still owe allegi - ance to
Arnold	LOCATION	.

		And yet , no one can say that our em - phasis to-day falls just where
Carlyle	PERSON	placed it .

		I refrain from characterizing
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's attitude , lest some wounded disciple rise against me in anger and sorrow ; but it is obvious that we can no longer look at life from precisely his point of view .

		Just so with
Arnold	LOCATION	.

		Aside from all personal sympathies , is it not evident that after
1880	DATE	there arose a generation of men of letters , quite remote from the often hysterical , usually Utopian , im - pulses of the men of
' 48	DATE	, yet on the other hand inclined to emphasize the value of audacity rather than caution in social experiment ?

		Profiting in a measure by the soberer ideas of social methods fostered in the long re - action , they yet felt that irresolution is as grave an in - tellectual danger as rash and precipitate action , and that exclusive harping on the dangers of rash action is likely to produce a kind of academic cowardice .

		They did not deny the force or importance of
Arnold	LOCATION	's teach - ing : they simply shifted the emphasis .

		Perhaps he might have been with them had he been a man of their day .

		These men were and are our own contemporaries ; the Fabians were of them ; and I have been surprised , in reading
Mackail	ORGANIZATION	's Life of
William Morris	PERSON	, to find much more serious thought and significant conviction than I had supposed , existing behind his aesthetic and emotional revolt .

		It is not easy to trace these subtle changes of em - phasis and of mood from generation to generation ; per - haps it is not worth while .

		They may prove quite un - 482 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, important in the great drama of the race .

		On the other baud , they may prove to have more significance than we know , and the society of the future may be glad that some obscure people tried , however stupidly , to follow them .

		We should be grateful to-day for sixteenth cen - tury interpretations of the phases of experience that preceded the Reformation ; we treasure all records of the shifting convictions which led up to the French Revolution .

		As to
Arnold	LOCATION	, Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	leans perhaps a little to the '' personal '' estimate of his work , 1 to the `` historic '' ; what the `` real '' estimate will be can not yet be said .

		Opinions may differ as to whether his em - phasis is that most distinctively and imperatively needed by the world just now ; but that the method and atti - tude be inculcates bold permanent and vital value , I should be the last to deny .

		All authors , even the small - est , live their life with their contemporaries , affecting them for good or ill ; the time comes when they may be said to die as authors as they have died as men .

		But those who have in them something of the immortal rise again ; that which is permanent in their achievement is now set free , to act no longer with the peculiar mag - netism possessed probably by the contemporary alone , but with the higher efficiency of a spiritual force , se - renely interacting with the other forces which proceed from the spirits of the ever-wise from the birth of time .

		The contemporary power of
Arnold	LOCATION	is rapidly passing away ; but already , for some of us , he is uplifted among the illuminating stars .

		The reviewer seems to be under the impression that the book contains new testi - mony in regard to the

		There is nothing new in the matter quoted at length by your reviewer .

		MILLAIS AND THE PRE-RAPHAELITES .

		* Mr.
John Guille Millais	PERSON	' life of his father is an exceptionally rich and delightful book a book likely , we should think , to provoke de - nial and perhaps rather heated protest from certain quarters in so far as it strays into the region of art politics , but one whose narrative charm and importance as a contribution to the literature of modern art can not be denied .

		With the salutary movement which , about the middle of the century , began to affect the Brit - ish school of painting and ended by placing it anew in the path of progress , the name of Mil - lais must ever be intimately and honorably associated ; although his critics have , not with - out a certain show or color of truth , charged him with a measure of apostasy from the stand - ard under which he battled in his militant and reforming days .

		A word about this movement and
Millais	PERSON	' share in it may be in order here .

		When the century began , the influence of a great group of masters headed by
Reynolds	PERSON	and
Gainsborough	PERSON	was still potent for good in British painting , and men like
Laurence	PERSON	,
Hoppner	PERSON	, and
Morland	PERSON	were carrying on the teaching and exemplifying the methods of these earlier chiefs of the national school .

		During the first decade , Constable ,
Crome	ORGANIZATION	, Cox , Wil - kie , and Ktty appeared to prove by their achievements the vitality of British art and the success that might attend the efforts of those workers who rightly grasped the aims and fol - lowed the methods of their great predecessors who , be it understood , while seeking in the schools all that the schools could give them , while reverencing the precepts and diligently studying the works of the masters , still never forgot to turn , as those masters themselves had turned , to Nature as the source and wellspring of all high and vital artistic achievement .

		But by the middle of the century a blighting change came over the spirit of British painting .

		Ped - antry and convention reigned ; and a style , a bastard and so-called Grand Style , founded not upon the study of Nature , but upon ab - stractions , and therefore declared to be essen - tially and nobly intellectual and imaginative and free from the taint of gross and trivial AND LETTERS OF SIR

		1899 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 483 material things , swayed the schools and the critics .

		A strange degeneracy in the works of the English artists followed .

		Forbidden to look upon the face of Nature as an unclean thing , they sunk into the slough of convention .

		To save the national art from extinction , drastic measures were necessary , and the stand - ard of revolt must be raised against the sacro - sanct doctrines about intellectual art , and the current blind worship of a pompous style , and vague and bombastic abstractions .

		With the crying necessity of the time , and when matters were at their worst , a group of young painters suddenly and dramatically rebelled against the solemn pedantries of their elders , and asserted with the courage of youth their disbelief in the creed of the day , and their determination to revert to a type of art based upon the closest study and imitation of nature , and hence con - taining the germs of great achievement .

		They decided that the principles which guided the earlier masters , and the observations which lay at the root of all great work , were being delib - erately decried by modern men , whose borrowed methods were bred of conventions set up by a long line of degenerate successors of
Raphael	PERSON	.

		Thus came into existence that revolutionary little band of associates , the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood , who so profoundly influenced the history of the
British School	ORGANIZATION	.

		Of the origin of the famous ''
P. R. B.	PERSON	, '' Mr.
Holman	PERSON	Hunt favored Mr.
Millais	PERSON	with the following account : It was in the beginning of the year
1848	DATE	that your father and I determined to adopt a style of absolute independence as to art-dogma and convention .

		This we called ` Pre-Raphaelitism . '

		D. G. llossetti was al - ready my pupil , and it seemed certain that he also , in time , would work on the same principles .

		He had de - clared his intention of doing so , and there was begin - ning to be some talk of other artists joining us , although in fact some were only in the most primitive stages of art , such as
William Rossetti	PERSON	, who was not even a stu - dent .

		Meanwhile ,
D. G. Rossetti	PERSON	, himself a beginner , had not got over the habit -LRB- acquired from
Madox Brown	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- of calling our art ` Early Christian ' ; so one day , in my studio , some time after our first meeting , I protested , saying that the term would confuse us with the German Quattro Centists .

		I went on to convince him that our real name was Pre-Raphaelites , ' a name which we had already so far revealed in frequent argu - ment that we had been taunted as holding opinions abominable enough to deserve burning at the stake .

		He thereupon , with a pet scheme of an extended cooper - ation still in mind , amended my previous suggestion by adding to our title of ' Pre-Raphaelite ' the word ' Brotherhood . ' ''

		Rossetti has always been popularly regarded as the leading light of Pre-Raphaelitism and the chief exponent of its creed and methods .

		This view involves a misconception of the move - ment , as may be gathered from
Millais	PERSON	' reply to his son 's question as to the extent of Ros - setti 's influence upon the style and character of his work .

		That he resented the supposition that such influence had been exerted , is plain . ''

		I doubt very much whether any man ever gets the credit of being quite square and above board about his life and work .

		The public are like sheep .

		They fol - low each other in admiring what they do n't understand -LRB- Omne ignotum pro magnifico -RRB- , and rarely take a man at what he is worth .

		If you affect a mysterious air , and are clever enough to conceal your ignorance , you stand a fair chance of being taken for a wiser man than you are ; but if you talk frankly and freely of yourself and your work , as you know I do , the odds are that any silly rumor you may fail to contradict will be accepted as true .

		That is just what has happened to me .

		The papers are good enough to speak of me as a typical English artist ; but because in my early days I saw a good deal of
Rossetti	PERSON	the mysterious and un-English
Rossetti	PERSON	they assume that my Pre-Raphaelite im - pulses in pursuit of light and truth were due to him .

		All nonsense !

		My pictures would have been exactly the same if I had never seen or heard of
Rossetti	PERSON	.

		I liked him very much when we first met , believing him to be -LRB- as perhaps he was -RRB- sincere in his desire to further our aims Hunt 's and mine but I always liked his brother
William	PERSON	much better .

		D.
G. Rossetti	PERSON	, you must understand , was a queer fellow , and impossible as a boon companion so dogmatic and so irritable when opposed .

		His aims and ideals in art were also widely different from ours , and it was not long before he drifted away from us to follow his own peculiar fancies .

		What they were may be seen from his subsequent works .

		They were highly imaginative and original and not without elements of beauty , but they were not nature .

		At last , when he presented for our admiration the young women which have since become the type of Ilos - settianism , the public opened their eyes in amazement .

		` And this , ' they said , ` is Pre-Raphaelitism ! '

		It was nothing of the sort .

		The Pre-Raphaelites had but one idea to present on canvas what they saw in nature ; and such productions were absolutely foreign to the spirit of their work . ''

		At first , the significance of the Pre-Raphael - ite movement was lost upon the general public ?

		and
Millais	PERSON	' painting of ''
Lorenzo	PERSON	and Isa - bella , '' exhibited at the Academy in
1849	DATE	?

		failed to provoke the onslaught of the critics ?

		although it asserted plainly enough his adher - ence to the new art heresy .

		In the following year the short-lived '' Germ '' was issued ; and when , in the
spring of 1850	DATE	, the next batch of Pre-Raphaelite productions was exhibited the storm burst .

		Its fury was chiefly directed against
Millais	PERSON	as the ablest and therefore the most dangerous of the group of innovators .

		His chief pictures , `` Ferdinand Lured by Ariel '' and '' Christ in the
House	ORGANIZATION	of His Parents , '' were attacked with a bitterness and an unscrupulous disregard of their obvious tech - nical merits that plainly indicated the alarm of the supporters and beneficiaries of the old sys - 484 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, tern .

		But the attack of
1850	DATE	was mild com - pared with the frenzy of the following year , when it was found that the Brotherhood , so far from bending to the storm of abuse , were quite ready to go to even greater lengths than before in the pictorial avowal of their revolt against the established order .


Millais	PERSON	was defiantly to the fore with his '' Return of the Dove to the Ark '' and ''
Mariana	PERSON	in the Moated Grange '' ; and it was he , again , as the heresiarch and preraphaelite enrage , who bore the brunt of the assault .

		The chief wea - pon used against him was misrepresentation .

		According to one type of the arguments em - ployed , '' Pre-Raffleism '' was '' a dodge , '' a bid for notoriety , and
Millais	PERSON	had thrown him - self into the movement merely to get himself advertised and to win the sort of distinction that attaches to eccentricity .

		Other writers gravely hinted that his art was sinister and reactionary in aim , and savored of black Jesu - itry and the wiles of
Rome	LOCATION	. ''

		Christ in the
House	ORGANIZATION	of His Parents , '' in fine , was '' an avowal of medieval superstition , a piece of Romanist propagandism designed to pervert the morals and upset the religious convictions of the community . ''

		This time , however , the cry of '' No Popery '' was so obviously and ludicrously a false alarm that the British pub - lic turned a deaf ear to it .

		Undoubtedly the unsparing and perhaps deliberately over - strained realism of the '' Christ in the
House	ORGANIZATION	of His Parents '' did shock a great many peo - ple , and was regarded by them as a species of pictorial blasphemy .

		This view was fairly ex - pressed by the writer in the '' Literary Gazette , '' who flatly denounced the picture as '' a name - less atrocity supposed to represent a verae of Zecharia . ''

		He went on to say : '' A miserable carpenter 's shop with two children em - bracing in front of the bench , and a naked distorted boy on the right side , are presented to us as high art , in which there is neither taste , drawing , expression , or genius .

		And yet this style pertains to an imitative school , which , the sooner it is sent back to the dry ness and wretched matter-of-fact of old times will be the better .

		Such things are simply disagreeable , if not worse , and neither can be called the true end of the fine arts . ''

		Another critic of this positivistic and matter - of-fact conception of the Holy Family kindly wound up his tirade of contumely by observing '' We have great difficulty in believing a report that this unpleasing and atrociously affected picture has found a purchaser at a high price '' ; and he then went on to pay his respects to the * ' Ferdinand Lured by
Ariel	PERSON	, '' as follows : ' Another specimen from the same brush inspires laughter rather than disgust .

		A Ferdinand of most ignoble physiognomy * is being lured by a pea-green monster , intended for
Ariel	ORGANIZATION	, whilst a row of sprites , such as it takes a Millais to devise , watch the operation with turquoise eyes .

		It would occupy more room than the thing is worth to expose all the absurdity and imperti - nence of this work . ''

		These sufficiently venomous assailants of the little band of revolutionaries seem to have taken their cue from the '' Times , '' which hounded them on , and demanded that '' no quarter '' be given to
Millais	PERSON	and his friends .

		Referring to
Millais	PERSON	'
Mariana	PERSON	, '' it proceeded to say : 41 These young artists have unfortunately become no - torious by addicting themselves to an antiquated style and an affected simplicity in painting ... We can extend no toleration to a mere senile imitation of the cramped style , false perspective , and crude color of remote antiquity .

		We do not want to see what
Fuseli	PERSON	termed drapery ` snapped instead of folded , ' faces bloated into apoplexy , or attenuated skeletons ; color borrowed from the jars in a druggist 's shop , and ex - pression forced into caricature . ''

		It was the above criticism in the Times that drew into the arena the doughty champion of the Brotherhood , whose powerful onset , skill of fence , and mastery of his theme , presently turned the tide of battle , gave pause to the flood of mere unthinking abuse , and gradually awoke the general public to the fact that in the decried and derided Pre-Raphaelitism lay the germ of great achievement and of the revival of the national art Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	.

		The battle was not won at once ; but the tone of even ad - verse criticism gradually changed , new adher - ents gathered to the support of the once de - spised cause , and the truth that underlay the doctrines and shone through the sometimes eccentric and affected performances of the young painters prevailed in the end .

		As the smoke of strenuous battle slowly cleared away , and it became clear that the despotic rule of academic pedantry and convention was broken , a change came over the style and methods of
Millais	PERSON	.

		For ten years , about the period of militant Pre-Raphaelitism , he adhered in his work to the letter of the creed .

		But as the necessity for the defiant and literal assertion in his canvasses of the principles of the sect passed away , and with it the combative mood of the zealous and persecuted propagandist , he began to abandon the rigid and elaborate nat - uralism , or literalism , of his earlier efforts , and to drift toward the breadth , the sug - gestiveness , the riotous freedom of touch and Thin WM donbtleM pleasant for Mr.

		THE DIAL 485 treatment that mark and ennoble his later and more characteristic works .

		There was no swerving in his devotion to truth and nature , but the transition in the mode of expression , though gradual , is pronounced .

		It is a far cry indeed from , say , '' Sir Isumbras at the
Ford	ORGANIZATION	, '' that quaint and elaborate piece of as - sertive Pre-Raphaelitism , to such canvasses as the '' Souvenir of Valasquez . ''


Millais	PERSON	was a practical man , a thoroughly modern man in his pursuits and way of thinking .

		He craved success , substantial and tangible success , and he sought it by the path which alone leads to it .

		There is no doubt that he popularized , so to speak , his art ; but he did not vulgarize it .

		His pictures are refinement itself , wonderfully executed withal , but a child can enjoy them .

		At the exhibitions , a painting by
Millais	PERSON	had always its crowd of admirers before it ; and their admiration was spontaneous and sincere .

		He painted for the public , and he painted the sort of pictures the public could understand and like and which would sell .

		His works are eminently English ; they commonly tell a little story , convey a bit of sentiment or illus - trate a well-known incident in literature .

		Their technical merit is great ; but their appeal is always a dual one the appeal to the few who can appreciate the skill of the artist and his mastery of tools and material and technical process , and to the many who see nothing in a picture save its theme .


Millais	PERSON	was far and away the most popular of latter-day English painters a capable , sound , naturally gifted , and rarely versatile painter , but hardly , we imagine , destined in the future to be accounted a painter of high and original genius .

		In writing the life of his father , Mr.
Guille Millais	PERSON	has had the advantage of an unusually attractive and fruitful subject .


Millais	PERSON	was a thoroughly wholesome , genial , and manly char - acter , preeminently a man with the social gift and the faculty of winning friends .

		Into the story of his career is unavoidably woven the richly anecdotal record of his professional and personal association with the celebrities of his time .

		It was the fashion to be painted by
Millais	PERSON	, just as it had been the fashion to be painted by
Reynolds	PERSON	.

		The chiefs of the world of politics , of literature , of fashion , sat to him as a matter of course ; and wherever
Millais	PERSON	found a sitter he made a friend .

		Of these con - nections of his father 's Mr.
Millais	PERSON	has freely availed himself , and his pages are brightened with many a capital story of men and women of whom the world likes to read .

		The real importance of the book lies , of course , in the fact that the name of
Millais	PERSON	is the greatest and most significant one in the history of mod - ern English painting .

		That history can not be told without reference to the influence and achievements of Sir
John Everett Millais	PERSON	.

		In a thoughtful and discriminative little book that may be read to advantage in con - nection with the lively and reminiscential nar - rative of Mr.
Guille Millais	PERSON	, Mr.
A. L. Baldry	PERSON	, a competent art writer of a rather philosoph - ical turn , discusses the work of
Millais	PERSON	and its bearing upon the artistic trend and production of his time .

		Disclaiming the intention of go - ing in detail into the personal history of Mil - lais , though he sets forth in a special chapter the essential biographical facts , Mr.
Baldry	PERSON	proceeds to weigh and analyze the result of his intervention , as an artist , in the aesthetic move - ments embraced within the period of his career .

		The story of Pre-Raphaelitism is outlined , and its import , aim , and ultimate effect are satis - factorily brought out , although , of course , there is not much said of the movement except in so far as it was embodied in the career of
Millais	PERSON	.

		A general introductory chapter on the history of the British School of painting paves the way for a due appreciation of that famous episode which was , be it said , not altogether without its ridiculous side , and of which its heroes seemed in their riper years to be just a little ashamed .

		Rossetti , especially , the least amiable of the mystic original trio , came finally to seriously resent any mention of the
P. R. B	ORGANIZATION	.

		In
1880	DATE	, as his brother records , he said testily to Mr.
Caine	PERSON	: '' As for all the prattle about Pre-Raphaelitism , I am weary of it , and long have been .

		Why should we go on talking about the visionary vanities of half-a-dozen boys ?

		What you call the movement was serious enough , but the banding together under that title was all a joke . ''

		To a lady who , about
1870	DATE	, innocently asked him if he was '' the Pre-Raphaelite Rossetti , '' he testily replied , '' Madam , I am not an * ite ' of any kind ; I am only a painter . ''

		But , adds his brother , '' it is not the less true that in
1848	DATE	and for some years afterwards he meant a good deal by calling himself Pre-Raphaelite , and meant it very heartily . ''

		Mr.
Baldry	PERSON	's book presents a very good re - view of
Millais	PERSON	' purely professional career , and it is copiously and attractively illustrated .

		There is a chronological list of paintings re - printed from Mr.
M. H. Spielmann	PERSON	's ''

		MIR MOST OF LIFE .

		* The author of the '' History of European Morals , '' the '' History of Rationalism , '' and '' Democracy and Liberty , '' has now issued an - other work , which will add to his already con - siderable reputation .

		The subject of this latest book , although nowhere explicitly stated , is , in effect , '' How to make the most of life . ''

		The point of view is somewhat Baconian in assum - ing throughout the interest of the individual as paramount in the discussion .

		After consideration of the value of reason - ing upon happiness , and the different means of attaining it , the author accepts , with some qual - ification , the English method of seeking happi - ness through improved circumstances .

		A few general rules follow , including
Carlyle	PERSON	's gospel of work , and
Ovid	LOCATION	's * -LSB- In -RSB- medio tutissimus ibis . ''

		But the Utilitarian philosophy is found insufficient : virtue is not to be identified with happiness , notwithstanding their intimate rela - tion .

		Unselfish interests are commended , de - spite the harm that has been done in the world by disproportioned compassion .

		Different ages have had different moral standards , the moral influences of the present being much more various and complex than in the past .

		Our civilization is primarily an industrial civiliza - tion , and our current virtues -LRB- as prudence , and the like -RRB- are the result rather of Industrialism than of Christianity .

		Science , too , has affected our judgments of right and wrong .

		While the world will never greatly differ about the essen - tial elements of right and wrong , there is likely to be a steadily increasing tendency to judge courses of conduct mainly by the degree in which they promote or diminish human happiness .

		Our moral judgments are extremely fallible when we attempt to measure degrees of guilt , and therefore our criminal code should be con - fined as much as possible to acts which more directly injure others .

		Human nature is neither essentially depraved uor essentially perfect : the origin of evil lies mainly in the weakness of the distinctively human quality , and the chief need is a restraining conscience , in the absence of which law and society are called upon to impose the needed restraint .

		Political and commercial dishonesty are publicly con - doned in a degree which raises a doubt whether social morality in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	has not seriously retrograded in these respects .

		Yet moral compromise is one of the great lessons of life .

		In the fictitious conventions of society , in the suspensions of the moral law exemplified in war , in the swerving from strict right on the part of the advocate and the judge , in the adherence of statesmen to a political party while voting for the details of law-making , in the adjustment of conflicting religious beliefs and forms of worship in the church itself , in all these fields of human activity there exists , and there must exist , a compromise between the moral ideal and the existing circumstances .

		A chapter follows upon the management of character , commending a happy childhood , ap - plauding athletics in moderation , and approv - ing that kind of education which acts upon the desires and the will . ''

		Money , '' '' Marriage , '' '' Success , '' '' Time , '' and '' The End , '' are the captions that follow .

		Money is a genuine ele - ment of happiness , but its value in this regard decreases rapidly in proportion to its amount . ''

		Whatever else marriage may do or fail to do , it never leaves a man unchanged , '' and so should be approached with consideration which shall take account of all the facts .

		Success depends upon character more than upon for - tune , and upon tact as much as upon either .

		If time be spent proportionately in work and pleasure and sleep , life will prove long enough ; and death is not to be dreaded , nor to be un - duly thought of : as long as a man is living right , he may leave the end to take care of itself .

		It is impossible , in thus briefly stating , fre - quently in the author 's own words , some of the main ideas in a book like this , to do justice to his details and his perspective .

		In particular , the judicial quality of mind that marks all Mr.
Lecky	PERSON	's thinking , and the multitude of his historical references , past and contemporary , elude such a summary .

		Among the subsidiary ideas that strike the reader is the statement that the diminution of disease and the prolongation of average human life that have been achieved by medical science are not necessarily accompanied by a corre - sponding improvement in the general health of the people ; one cause of this state of things being the saving of the lives of children consti - tutionally weak , who thus grow up and propa - gate feeble offspring .

		Again , vivisection is defended , and also field sports that involve the destruction of animals .

		In the Irish land legis - lation of
Gladstone	PERSON	and his followers , the sym - pathy of the writer is strongly on the side of the landlords , who have been deprived of their rights of contract by parliamentary proceedings
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 487 which are characterized as fraudulent .

		The author 's farthest departure from a judicial atti - tude is exemplified in frequent derogatory ref - erence to the
Roman Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	, though even here it is but just to say that facts are commonly cited to confirm the position taken .

		Those phases of Anglican ritual that approach the Roman ceremonial are deplored , while full recognition is given to the conspicuous place the Anglican clergy has taken in English liter - ature , poetry and prose .

		The military unrest that pervades
Europe	LOCATION	is summarized in a single pithy sentence : '' After eighteen hundred years ' profession of the creed of peace ,
Christ	LOCATION	- endom is an armed camp . ''

		The American reader will note that the num - ber of young men of ability preparing for the service of the
English Church	ORGANIZATION	is said to be diminishing , and will compare this testimony with the evidence on this side the
Atlantic	LOCATION	that the hold of the Church upon the people is re - laxed , whatever be the cause .

		He will contrast the '' aggravated treachery and perjury '' as - cribed herein to
John Boyle O'Reilly	PERSON	with the action of
Boston	LOCATION	in
1896	DATE	in accepting an artistic monument to this Irish poet-patriot , to remain in her public ways so long as the stone shall endure .

		And he will note with pleasure , in a discussion of the ethics of war , the following tribute to American humanity : '' The great civil war in
America	LOCATION	probably contrib - uted not a little to raise the standard of humanity in war ; for while few long wars have been fought with such determination or at the cost of so many lives , very few have been conducted with such a scrupulous ab - stinence from acts of wanton barbarity . ''

		It is fitting that the quality of this note - worthy book should be judged by one or two further extracts , chosen with intention to give specimens of the author 's method of handling a subject , and his rhetorical style .

		First , we will take a passage representing reflection upon a general topic , which , however , will suggest actual American conditions : '' There is one belief , half unconscious , half avowed , which in our generation is passing widely over the world and is practically accepted in a very large meas - ure by the English-speaking nations .

		It is that to reclaim savage tribes to civilization , and to place the outlying dominions of civilized countries which are an - archical or grossly misgoverned in the hands of rulers who govern wisely and uprightly , are sufficient justifi - cation for aggression and conquest .

		Many who , as a general rule , would severely censure an unjust and un - provoked war , carried on for the purpose of annexation by a strong Power against a weak one , will excuse or scarcely condemn such a war if it is directed against a country which has shown itself incapable of good gov - ernment .

		To place the world in the hands of those who can best govern it is looked upon as a supreme end .

		Wars are not really undertaken for this end .

		The philanthropy of nations when it takes the form of war and conquest is seldom or never immixed with selfish - ness , though strong gusts of humanitarian enthusiasm often give an impulse , a pretext , or a support to the cal - culated actions of statesmen .

		But when wars , however selfish and unprovoked , contribute to enlarge the bound - aries of civilization , to stimulate real progress , to put an end to savage customs , to oppression , or to anarchy , they are now very indulgently judged even in the many cases in which the inhabitants of the conquered Power do not desire the change and resist it strenuously in the field . ''

		Again , as a bit of description of a concrete fact , somewhat surprising to those unacquainted with the English method of taking a `` division '' of a vote in
Parliament	LOCATION	, this may be quoted : '' Every member of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	is familiar with the scene , when , after a debate , carried on before nearly empty benches , the division bell rings , and the mem - bers stream in to decide the issue .

		There is a moment of uncertainty .

		The questions ' Which side are we ? '

		1 What is it about ? '

		may be heard again and again .

		Then the Speaker rises , and with one magical sentence clears the situation .

		It is the sentence in which he an - nounces that the tellers for the Ayes or Noes , as the case may be , are the
Government	ORGANIZATION	whips .

		It is not argu - ment , it is not eloquence , it is this single sentence which in countless cases determines the result and moulds the legislation of the country . ''

		Mr.
Lecky	PERSON	's book shows the result of wide reading .

		Among the writers with whom the author shows familiarity are Tocqueville , Hugo ,
Rousseau	PERSON	, Mme.
de Stael	PERSON	, among the French ;
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, of the Germans ;
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Tenny	PERSON	- son , Lamb , Swift ,
Gibbon	PERSON	,
Darwin	LOCATION	,
Hamerton	LOCATION	, Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	, and
Cardinal Newman	PERSON	, of British writers ; and of Americans ,
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Franklin	PERSON	, Cable , and
Hawthorne	LOCATION	.

		Of the thinkers of an earlier day , reference is made to
Plato	ORGANIZATION	,
Tacitus	ORGANIZATION	,
Seneca	LOCATION	,
Propertius	PERSON	,
Marcus Aurelius	PERSON	, and
Thomas Aquinas	PERSON	.

		Carlyle has been read with peculiar appreciation , which is proved not only by the frequent mention of this author by name , but also by the assimila - tion of Carlylean thoughts and phrases .

		The book is plainly the mature product of a mind accustomed to view and reflect upon life in the many phases of its present and past activity .

		It is seldom that one gets a sweep of vision that includes , on the one hand , the
Reforma	LOCATION	- tion and its concomitants , and on the other so recent events as the
Jameson	PERSON	raid and the
Dreyfus	ORGANIZATION	case .

		Seldom is philosophical reflec - tion so combined with a mastery of concrete details , in a result which , whatever the reader 's opinions , will awaken his thought and increase his knowledge .

EGYPT	LOCATION	OF TO-DAY .

		* He who has once tasted the water of the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	, longs for it inexpressibly forevermore '' so runs the Arab proverb ; and to read Mr.
Pen	PERSON	- field 's book on * Present-Day
Egypt	LOCATION	, '' so ad - mirably published by the
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is to feel the proverb 's meaning .

		We have plenty of guide - books and histories dealing with
Egypt	LOCATION	, but this volume is neither a guide-book nor a history .

		It is , rather , a collection of impres - sions , appreciations , facts , opinions , and de - scriptions , arranged in a somewhat desultory fashion , and often showing less literary than other merits .

		Perhaps it gives a truer unity of impression for its very miscellaneity .

		For where else in the world can we find the equal of
Egypt	LOCATION	for thriving under that which is in - consistent and unsystematic ?

		The volume boasts no great descriptive charm , yet it is vivid and certainly enables one to get something of life in
Cairo	LOCATION	and
Alexandria	LOCATION	.

		Of course there is the
Egypt	LOCATION	of the scholar , and its glories , like the light upon the
Mokattam Hills	LOCATION	, are always upon the
Egypt	LOCATION	of the tourist .

		Of the two Egypts , Mr.
Penfield	PERSON	gives us the latter .

		He is not an archaeologist by trade , and he handles history a trifle generously as when he allows
Plutarch	ORGANIZATION	to become a contemporary of Cleo - patra .

		His interests are those of the man of affairs ; and while he does admirably share with his readers something of the opera bouffe that is one element of Egyptian life to-day , at bottom he is more concerned with the complicated prob - lem of Egyptian administration .

		It is his com - ment upon this subject which , in the light of his peculiarly advantageous position as Diplo - matic Agent of the
United States	LOCATION	, gives the book value to the student of modern history .

		The administration of
Egypt	LOCATION	to-day is prob - ably the most remarkable of any country of its size and importance .

		Because of bankruptcy resulting from the conscienceless '' promotion '' of the
Suez Canal	ORGANIZATION	by De Lesseps , and the fab - ulous prodigality of
Ismail Pasha	PERSON	,
Egypt	LOCATION	is really governed by several European countries , though the Khedive has a nominal independ - ence , limited only by his loose relations with
Turkey	LOCATION	.

		As a matter of fact , the country has really gone into the hands of a receiver En - gland who , in the person of
Lord Cromer	LOCATION	, is managing all of its affairs .

		receivership ,
Egypt	LOCATION	is growing rich .

		Its fella - heen are getting to be landed proprietors in a small way ; the
Delta	ORGANIZATION	is covered with cotton , the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	is lined with sugar factories , and its waters are even now being dammed into new serviceability to agriculture and electricity ; the railroad , which will soon run from
Cairo	LOCATION	to Khartum if not to
Cape Town	LOCATION	already clears fifty-seven per cent of its gross income ; while the exports have risen from fifty-five millions in
1880	DATE	to sixty-six millions in
1896	DATE	.

		These results of English occupation make one look with interest for Mr.
Penfield	PERSON	's judgment upon the matter .

		It is candid , and , to say the least , certainly does not rest upon
Anglomania	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Penfield	PERSON	is a friend of
Khedive Abbas	PERSON	, and one feels throughout the book an effort to keep from expressing certain sentiments con - cerning
England	LOCATION	's general attitude .

		Nor are criticisms upon
England	LOCATION	's administration want - ing .

		But notwithstanding all this , Mr.
Pen	PERSON	- field says : '' Is
Egypt	LOCATION	capable of self-government ?

		The can - dor prompting one , after long and disinterested study of Egyptian matters in the country itself , to say that
England	LOCATION	has performed her self-appointed task better than any other nation could have performed it , likewise compels one to state frankly that
Egypt	LOCATION	is not capable of complete self-government at the present time , for she has no class of officials trained in the higher ranges of administrative work .

		No other nation should ever be permitted to supplant
England	LOCATION	as administrator or ' occupier ' certainly '' -LRB- p. 333 -RRB- .

		It is such judgments as this and one meets them frequently that give the volume a value quite above its descriptions and anecdotes .

		In Mr.
Penfield	PERSON	's opinion , English '' occupancy '' has proved beneficial to
Egypt	LOCATION	in almost every particular , and would -LRB- so it is fair to interpret some of his statements -RRB- be even more beneficial if the anomalous international courts and offi - cials were abolished .

		As to the future , he is cautious but equally candid .

		With the com - pletion of the great dam at
Assuan	LOCATION	, the tillable area of
Egypt	LOCATION	will be greatly increased , and
England	LOCATION	will be all the less likely to give up what she has so sturdily won . ''

		A dozen years hence , all that portion of the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	valley from the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	to Khartum and farther south will be represented in school-books as a pendant from
Britain	LOCATION	's red girdle of the globe .

		How it is to be accomplished , legally and morally , is a matter regard - ing which I do not conjecture .

		In time , something may ' turn up ' helpful to the legal aspect of
England	LOCATION	's posi - tion in
Egypt	LOCATION	. ''

		And may we not venture to hope that the moral aspect as well will be recognized ?

		Is there not certain to be , sooner or later in international

		THE DIAL 489 law , a sort of '' right of eminent domain '' that will not allow an unprogressive , selfish , or mis - governed little nation to stand in the way of universal progress ?

		The idea may be visionary , but any careful reader of Mr.

Egypt	LOCATION	, so violent and questionable at the start , and to-day so much at variance with the proclamations of
Wolseley	ORGANIZATION	and
Seymour	PERSON	during the Arabi rebellion , is a strong argu - ment in its favor .

		At all events , the volume itself is timely and worthy of being widely read .

		VARIOUS ASPECTS OF
HAWAII	LOCATION	.

		* The many lines of interest which converge in the cosmopolitan life of the Hawaiian Is - lands make it possible to present their story from different points of view .

		This is well ex - emplified in the many recent books upon the subject .

		Lieutenant
Lucien Young	PERSON	, of the
United States Navy	ORGANIZATION	, was on the ''
Boston	LOCATION	, '' stationed at
Honolulu	LOCATION	for seven months prior to , and also following , the overthrow of the Hawaiian mon - archy .

		Believing that the Blount report un - fairly represented the diplomatic and naval officers of the
United States	LOCATION	, he requested per - mission to print his account of the incident , but was denied the privilege .

		This has since been granted by Secretary Long , and his report was published as '' The '
Boston	LOCATION	' at
Hawaii	LOCATION	, '' a re - vised and enlarged edition of which is now at hand under the title '' The Real
Hawaii	LOCATION	. ''

		The book is crammed full of descriptive matter of an unusually wide range from the point of view of a very observant naval officer .

		While much of this is not new , it is unusually complete and is tersely told ; and an appendix of statistical data adds further to its usefulness .

		Of espe - cial interest are the chapters upon the natural resources of the country and upon land tenure .

		The main feature of the book , however , is the narrative of the Revolution , which gives not a little inside history of the events which cul - minated in the overthrow of the monarchy .

		This is minutely related with especial reference to the charges subsequently made against Min - ister

Wiltse	PERSON	.

		The blunt sincerity of the tale will at least go far toward confirming the opinions of the author 's fellow partisans .

		He is confessedly an advocate , and spares no pains to advance his case and to be - little his opponents .

		Barring this excess of zeal and some uneliminated repetitions , the book is a welcome addition to the literature of the subject .

		Miss
Mabel Craft	ORGANIZATION	represented some of the leading American newspapers in the
Islands	LOCATION	during the last days of the Republic , and in her ''
Hawaii Nei	ORGANIZATION	'' she writes of recent events and of the more picturesque phases of
Hawai	LOCATION	- ian life .

		Her book is interesting indeed , there is not a dull page in it ; and her well - chosen themes are not hackneyed .

		A keen eye for the picturesque , a facile pen , and a piquant style assist her sympathetic portrayal of the wronged native , the oppressed laborer from the Orient , and the persecuted witch-doctor , and add spice to her righteous indignation at the millionaire missionaries with their chill
New England	LOCATION	ways who have invaded this
Eden	ORGANIZATION	.

		Miss Craft has evidently taken her cue from the stratum of
Honolulu	LOCATION	society which was in favor at the court of the recent queen a point of vantage for access to certain phases of Ha - waiian life which she alone of recent writers has fully portrayed .

		But there are other circles , alike of native and of Anglo-Saxon constitu - ency , whose acts and motives she neither ade - quately understands nor justly portrays , and too often indiscriminately condemns .

		Discerning readers will enjoy her book , though they may smile at her zeal for her friends , and may be compelled at times to adjust her rhetoric to the facts of history .

		The illustrations are new , appropriate , and well executed .

		In her '' Transformation of
Hawaii	LOCATION	, ''
Miss Belle M. Brain	ORGANIZATION	has prepared for young readers a brief account of the work of evangelical mis - sions among the Hawaiian people .

		The book contains well-selected descriptive matter , and more than the usual reference to the native tongue .

		The story of the great religious awak - ening of
1837	DATE	to
1843	DATE	comes from a sympa - thetic pen .

		The relation of Hawaiian missions to similar work among other Polynesian and among Micronesian peoples is explained , and the interesting history of the children 's mis - sionary ship , '' The Morning Star , '' is told at length .

		The entrance of the Roman Catholic mission is described , but those who seek a full 490 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, account of the present religious status in the islands must look elsewhere for example , to Professor
Blackman	PERSON	's book for statistics showing the spread of Catholicism and Mor - monism , and for an account of the revival of paganism and the defection from and present decline of the native evangelical churches due to social and political causes .

		The author has failed to portray the survival of the missionary spirit and the varied religious and philan - thropic agencies still at work in the transfor - mation of these islands .

		From these books of passing interest , one turns with pleasure to the substantial and schol - arly work of Professor
Blackman	PERSON	upon '' The Making of
Hawaii	LOCATION	. ''

		It is a serious study of the social and economic conditions of the prim - itive Hawaiian race , and of the introduction and rapid growth of the institutions of Western civilization in the midst of a population of ever increasing complexity .

		We quote from his preface : '' The Hawaiian Islands afford better facilities , per - haps , than any other field for a study of some important social problems .

		This fact is due to the blending there of the temperate and tropical climates ; the admixture of divers and widely different races ; the contact of civilized and native peoples under unique conditions , and with results in some respects unexampled , and in all respects instructive ; the collision of the Christian , the secular , and the pagan , each in very vital forms ; the rapid evolution from a primitive to a highly devel - oped condition of the four fundamental and perduring social institutions , the family , the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, the
State	ORGANIZATION	, and property ; the control of industries by corporations , to an unusual degree ; the close juxtaposition in recent years of the wealthy few and a poor multitude , and all this within narrow and manageable limits of time , of area , and of population . ''

		The author divides his subject into the earlier , middle , and later periods , the last constituting the greater part of his work and treating of present-day problems of general interest .

		A spirit of unusual candor pervades his treatment of the missionary movement , and its successes and failures in the moral , religious , and ethical regeneration of a people of low ideals debased by contact with the vices of Anglo-Saxon civil - ization .

		The growth of constitutional law and the legal code is traced from the chaotic con - ditions of the early feudal life to the annexa - tion of the republic .

		Land tenures and the distribution of land holdings are treated very fully , while the commercial and industrial development is discussed more fully than in any recent work .

		The causes of the decline of the native race are inquired into , and the Asiatic invasion is condemned .

		In the matter of con - tract labor , the pros and cons of which are impartially given , the author is inclined to think that white labor has not yet had a fair trial , and that better wages and a better class of labor are not impossible under present eco - nomic conditions .

		The author is also sanguine as to the success of the Anglo-Saxon in tropical colonization , at least in these islands .

		The work is to be commended for the spirit of can - dor in which all vexed and debatable questions are discussed , for the breadth of view with which topics of wide import are treated , for the perspective manifest in the choice of material presented , and for the thoroughness with which the task has been completed .

		It is a standard work for all who wish a judicial estimate of the social , economic , and political factors at work in the making of American civilization in the
Hawaii	LOCATION	of to-day .

		1899 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 491 tion is too complex to be brought readily within the scope of a single work of fiction , if anything like unity of plot is to be preserved , and Mr.
Ford	PERSON	has done wisely in not attempting so much as that .

		But his work does cover , and with reasonable thorough - ness , these phases of the struggle that were centred about
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	and
New Jersey	LOCATION	, together with the closing years of the campaign in the South .

		And we feel an unusual confidence in our guide through this tangle of battle , of military plot and counterplot , from the fact of his thorough scholar - ship , so well approved by his numerous books of a more formal historical character .

		Mr.
Ford	PERSON	em - bodies the rare combination of a wide and accurate knowledge of the facts of history with the peculiar talents of the novelist .

		His characters are drawn to the life , although it must be admitted that he is a shade less successful with the figures he takes from history than with those whom his imagination creates .

		His
Janice	PERSON	is one of the most winsome of creatures , feminine to the finger-tips , and spark - ling with animation .

		The hero is hardly less attrac - tive in his sterner way , and the whole group of private characters about whom the story centres are made very real to us by the creative skill of the writer , deftly reinforced as it is at so many points by bits of antiquarian fact and flashes of light upon colonial ways of thinking and living .

		The closest parallelism which the work suggests is with that fine novel of an earlier period , Miss
Mary Johnston	PERSON	's '' Prisoners of Hope . ''

		In both cases the hero is a '' redemptioner '' loved by the daughter of a master who has all the crusted prejudices of a gentleman of the old school .

		The likeness of the two books in this respect is too striking to be overlooked .

		But Mr.
Ford	PERSON	need not be offended by this comparison , for he would be the first to recognize the excellences of the book which he calls to mind .

		Beyond this , his treatment is his own , and we have to thank him most cordially for his picture of a stirring time and a great action .

		Few novels of the year will be likely to equal ''
Janice Meredith	PERSON	'' either in interest or in wholesome instructiveness .

		Recollections of that study in chromatic emotion , The Red Badge of Courage , '' and of the ineffec - tual pieces of realism by which it was followed , have not led us to expect work of any sort of real inter - est and value from Mr.
Stephen Crane	PERSON	.

		His repu - tation seems to have risen like a rocket amid the glare of colored fires , and come down to earth like .

		the proverbial stick .

		It is , then , with considerable surprise that we find in '' Active Service '' a novel which , while not exactly meritorious according to a serious standard , is at least readable and entertain - i n g > by virtue of having a real story to tell , and of telling it with much effectiveness .

		The story is of an American journalist in love with the daughter of a college professor .

		The professor takes his family to
Greece	LOCATION	, together with a class of archaeo - logical students , and gets into a position of much difficulty by reason of the war with
Turkey	LOCATION	.

		The journalist constitutes himself a relief expedition , for personal reasons no less than for the glory of his '' yellow '' newspaper , extricates the party from the clutches of the Turk , and marries the young woman .

		The story is not without grave faults .

		The profes - sor is a caricature , and his students are of the slangy sort that would never by any possibility be found members of such a party as is described .

		The jour - nalist is an example of the '' smart '' and unscrup - ulous type developed by the most objectionable sort of newspaper enterprise , and the young woman for - feits our sympathies by caring at all for such a fellow .

		But the story has consecutive development and abundance of excitement , for which qualities it may be exempted from complete condemnation . ''

		A Confident Tomorrow , '' the latest novel by Mr.
Brander Matthews	PERSON	, is everywhere charming , although in no respect to be characterized as pow - erful .

		It is a story of
New York	LOCATION	society , and of the career of a young man from the West who seeks his fortune in the field of letters .

		The crudity of his culture , when he makes his early appearances upon the scene , appears to us a little overdone , and it is something of a strain to believe that even a young man from
Topeka	LOCATION	would , under all the cir - cumstances , accept social invitations upon postal cards , or think ready-made clothing the proper ap - parel for evening entertainments .

		The somewhat colorless young woman with whom he promptly falls in love is not depicted with an attractiveness so convincing as to account for his passion , and when the affair is settled between them at the end , it rather takes us by surprise .

		But of the lighter graces of fiction-writing Mr.
Matthews	PERSON	has enough and to spare .

		The bit of decorative incident , the humorous or pathetic episode , the easy small talk of office and drawing-room , all these things are done to the life , done almost as well as Mr.
Howells	PERSON	could do them , and this finished sort of detail is what constitutes the real charm of the novel .

		The literary `` shop '' talk , which is necessarily intro - duced over and over again , is absolutely convincing in its naturalness , and provides the novel with one of its most satisfactory features .

		Mr.
Horace Annesley Vachell	PERSON	has promptly fol - lowed up his recent success with '' The Procession of Life '' by a new novel of
California	LOCATION	entitled '' A Drama in Sunshine . ''

		The new book is a story of land-speculation and the unscrupulous methods by which the foundations of more than one
Calif	LOCATION	ornian fortune have been laid during the last fifty years .

		The character of the heroine is the principal achieve - ment of the novel , and her purity and strength go far to soften its otherwise sordid and repellant theme .

		The man upon whom she bestows her love is a weak creature , ethically considered , although he stands in the eyes of the world as the type of aggressive will and outward success .

		At the end , some sort of moral regeneration seems to be begin - ning in him , as he is brought face to face with the danger of losing the woman whom he has at last learned to value at her true worth .

		There is much vivid description in the work , and an excellent sense 492 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, of dramatic effect We are brought into close con - tact with the realities some of which are grim indeed of the fresh and feverish life of the far West , and we feel that this life , at least in certain of its more obvious phases , has found in the author a stronger and more clear-sighted exponent than it has hitherto had save in the person of Mr.
Bret Harte	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Vachell	PERSON	's style is thus far too nervous and direct to allow of the higher finish , but even in this respect he has been gaining rapidly since his first publications , and there seem to be in him the makings of a novelist of the better sort .

		Sermons in the guise of fiction have been over - much our lot in recent years , but we do not often have to reckon with a tract so unabashed as ''
Henry Worthington	PERSON	, Idealist '' It might have for its sub - title '' an argument in defence of the Consumers ' League and a protest against educational endow - ments of questionable origin . ''

		Indeed , some such prefatory heralding of its purpose seems almost morally obligatory in this case , for Miss
Margaret Sherwood	PERSON	, the author of the book , has an excep - tional command of the literary graces , and the power to make a dull theme attractive by virtue of keeping fast hold of the fundamental human inter - ests concerned .

		Her book is an intensely feminine production , feminine in its many minute details and in the exaggeration of sentiment wherewith it is infused .

		It turns upon a university endowment provided by a merchant whose gains are derived from a system of department stores in several large cities .

		The social and economic evils attendant upon this form of gainful occupation are pictured with passionate indignation rather than with calm acceptance of all the facts involved , and when the merchant sets aside a portion of his wealth for ed - ucational uses , he encounters the earnest opposition of a young teacher in the favored institution , who investigates the origins of this wealth and denounces its acceptance by the university as the condonation of a crime .

		As a matter of course , this youthful idealist is promptly dismissed by the trustees ; but compensation comes to him with the love of the merchant 's daughter , who views her father 's wealth with a like abhorrence .

		We say as a matter of course , meaning simply that the demands of the writer 's scheme make this outcome imperative , and not that such a dismissal , made in such a way , has much inherent probability .

		There has been much talk of this sort of persecution during re - cent years , but we are inclined to doubt that such things really occur , and we are quite sure that they never occur as here described in other words , that college professors in good standing are dis - missed from their posts in secret session , and with - out even knowing that they are being arraigned , because their teaching differs from the opinions held by the authorities .

		The thing is so overdone by the present novelist that her book loses all real force .

		Written with the best of intentions , and inspired by the finest of idealism , it is not dispas - sionate enough to carry weight , and the evils whirh it assails require a more careful analysis than they are here given .

		We wish in closing to pay a re - newed tribute to the noble spirit of the work whirh
Miss Sherwood	LOCATION	has sought to do , and to the skill in characterization which makes her book so read - able , despite its lack of intellectual balance and its excess of emotionalism .

		-LSB- ~ ~ ~ | The posthumous novel of Mr * .

		Blanche
Willis Howard von Tenfel	PERSON	deserved a better title than the awkward '' Dionysius the
Weaver	PERSON	's Heart 's Dear - est , '' which is as Teutonic in its ungainliness as much of the dialogue which it contains .

		The dia - logue has this character of necessity , because it be - longs to a group of Swiss peasants , whose rude , direct form of speech is reproduced with admirable fidelity .

		It is a simple story , almost wholly con - cerned with one person , the beloved daughter of the weaver , and the heroine of whatever plot the story may be admitted to possess .

		It is the life - story of this girl , of her successful career , her one error , and her atonement .

		She has her own notions of right and wrong , and refuses to allow her life to be utterly wrecked by a single act of wrongdoing .

		Her independence and directness of character , her native scorn of the shams encouraged by conven - tional society , and her determination to live her own life in accordance with her own standards of con - duct , are presented to the reader with singularly appealing force , and admiration for her virtues is mingled with pity for her fault .

		The book is not of the writer 's best , and has numerous pages that might easily be spared , but the story which it has to tell commends itself to all honest sympathies .

		It is some time before the reader comes to under - stand why Miss
Cholmondeley	PERSON	's '' Red Pottage '' should be -LRB- as it seemingly is -RRB- the English novel of the year .

		The caprices of public taste in such mat - ters are so inexplicable that one is inclined , by the time he gets half through with the book , to ascribe its vogue to some such popular vagary as that which not so long ago singled out '' Trilby , '' and more recently ''
David Harum	PERSON	, '' for such ephemeral dis - tinction .

		The situations outlined seem strained , and the style is far from impeccable .

		Moreover , the interest , which at first is sharply focuseed upon a certain character , becomes diverted into numerous secondary channels , and the reader grows singu - larly impatient .

		But as the story is pursued to the end , and the threads so long left loose are gathered up into a single tragic knot , and the writer 's powers of characterization become more and more firmly established , and a relentless destiny finally asserts its controlling and implacable claims upon all the lives concerned , a revision of the earlier opinion is forced upon us ; we are compelled to recognize the strength of the work , and its success is made ration - ally intelligible .

		The point of honor upon which the plot all hangs is an artificial one , and it may be held that fate deals too harshly with the hero for his sin , but according to the conventional code of the society in which he lives , there is no other pos - sible outcome .

		Yet if poetic justice is thus inex -
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 493 orably worked out in the one case , we can but feel that its hand is unduly stayed in the case of the other criminal -LRB- of so different a sort ! -RRB-

		who is simply a fool , and who escapes chastisement because he is one .

		The contrast between these two offenders is one that extends to other characters of the novel , and which divides them sharply into two classes those whose lives are made up of thought and feeling , and those who live vegetable existences , never knowing what it is to think clearly or to feel sincerely .

		There is something impressive in the tragic irony that invests the life of the clergyman who figures so largely in this story , and makes him the instrument of a trag - edy which he can never even remotely comprehend .

		The chapter which deals with this episode is fitly headed with the motto , '' Les sots sont plus a craindre que les me ` chants . ''

		We would not convey the idea that the novel is all gloom .

		So far from having this exclusive attribute , it is enlivened to a notable degree with flashes of quiet humor , and gentle touches of social satire .

		And it is a book which engages the closest attention , whether for its minor incidents or for the larger lines upon which it is constructed .

		To write comedy which shall skirt the borders of tragedy without once overstepping the boundary line is no easy task , but this is what Miss Violet Hunt has done , and done with charming success , in `` The Human Interest . ''

		We get very close to the danger-point in one scene , but even then the situa - tion is saved by the opportune death of a husband who is distinctly in the way , both of his wife and of the novelist 's plans .

		This device is a trifle banal , but banality is the last attribute to be credited to Miss Hunt 's work as a whole , for that work offers audacious groupings , epigrammatic dialogue , and general sprightliness of manner , all of which quali - ties combine to make a book in which hardly one dull page is to be found .

		Kings have always figured largely among the heroes of romantic fiction .

		Their exalted station , and the artificial splendors that hedge them about , have proved irresistible magnets to the imagina - tions of novel-writers and to the interests of novel - readers .

		Given an attractive kingly personality for the central figure , and the success of a romance was already half-assured .

		But the king as a psycho - logical type , as a special character-study to be viewed from within , is a comparatively new devel - opment in fiction .

		The interest with which such a character may become invested in the hands of a master-craftsman of letters is evident enough to those who are familiar with
Herr BjOrnson	PERSON	's ''
Kon	PERSON	- gen '' and
Heer Couperus	PERSON	's '' Majesteit . ''

		It also becomes evident in the latest novel of Mr. ''
Anthony Hope	PERSON	, '' entitled '' The King 's Mirror . ''

		The naive question put in ''
Huckleberry Finn	PERSON	, '' '' How much does a king get ? ''

		is typical of the new curiosity about kings which such books as these serve to gratify . ''

		The King 's Mirror '' takes the form of an autobiographical narrative in which the life of royalty , from childhood to maturity , the conditions and prescriptions which set a king apart from other men , are set forth with much insight and human sympathy .

		This is the life-story of a real king , not of a puppet like the ruler of
Buritania	LOCATION	, and it is told with convincing truthfulness .

		It is much the finest piece of work that the author has thus far done , although we must warn its readers that it provides less of mere entertainment than his earlier ro - mances .

		But it certainly marks an advance in his art , and in the power of his appeal to the serious intelligence .

		Mr.
Egerton Castle	PERSON	's '' Young
April	DATE	'' is also , in part , a book about a king , but here the interest is purely romantic , and nothing in the nature of psychological insight is for a moment displayed .

		The escapade of a young English nobleman , just emancipated from tutorial thraldom , and plunged into the intrigues of a petty German principality , forms the theme of this captivating tale .

		A group of deeply interesting characters , both men and women , set in a variety of passionate interrelations , hold the attention absorbed , until a brief month is past , and the scene dissolves .

		It is a romance of the springtime of life when a few weeks may hold in quintessence all the reality vouchsafed to a whole lifetime , and , having taken flight , leave noth - ing behind but the embers of passion , and '' a world of memories and sighs . ''

		The diction of this book is strange and beautiful , riotous in its expression of surging emotion , and marred only now and then by some infelicitous word , some Gallic construction , some sense of incongruity arising from an occasional realistic brush-stroke upon the imaginative canvas .

		But it is not pleasant to be over-critical in the pres - ence of such full-blooded romance , and the book has so many exquisite pages that the few lapses from its inherent idealism may well be permitted to pass unmentioned .

		It is a book to enjoy and not to dissect .

		In writing '' The Courtship of
Morice Buckler	PERSON	, '' Mr.
A. E. W. Mason	PERSON	proved himself one of the best of our contemporary romantic novelists , and his name upon a title-page is an unquestionable pass - port to popular favor .

		The name now reappears upon two title-pages , that of '' Miranda of the Bal - cony , '' where it stands alone , and that of ''
Parson Kelly	PERSON	, '' where it is associated with the name of Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	.

		A close comparative study of these two books would yield some interesting results .

		Mr.
Mason	PERSON	's own unaided work is a tale of Englishmen and Moors with a Spanish setting .

		It offers a great variety of incident , skilfully handled , although re - lying too much for the loosening of its knots upon those coincidences and contretemps that rarely hap - pen in real life , and that strain the credulity of readers well nigh to the breaking point .

		The loose threads of the plot are in the end most ingeniously interwoven , and the product is undeniably enter - taining .

		The romance has , moreover , an impres - sive degree of virile strength , and is constructed with such economy of material that it must be read carefully in order to avoid missing some essential 494 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, link in the narrative .

		In the joint work of Mr.
Mason	PERSON	and Mr.
Lang	PERSON	, on the other hand , there is a tendency to indulge in episodical matter that is not so essential to the development of the story , and the setting of the whole , while still romantic , is also historical , and more conscientiously histor - ical than is usually the case with books of this sort .

		In a word , ''
Parson Kelly	PERSON	'' is a romance of the Jacobite plottings of the quarter-century that led np to the Forty - Five , and the minute historical detail must be credited to Mr.
Lang	PERSON	, whose intimate ac - quaintance with the subject is equalled by few pro- fessional historians .

		To him , also , must be credited many a quip , conceit , and scholarly allusion , all of which bear the unmistakable stamp of his peculiar talent These matters supply the very salt of the work , and , although Mr.
Mason	PERSON	's name takes the first place upon the title-page , we find much more of Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's handiwork in the contents .

		The story itself is one of the most readable that have come to our notice of late years , and deserves warm commendation , both as a study of the historical period concerned , and as a specimen of the novel of plot , counterplot , and intrigue .

		WILLIAM
MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		HOLIDAY PUBLICATIONS .

		m , Mr.
Francis Marion Crawford	PERSON	adds himself to the number of novelists who have explained that their portraits in literature are not mere photo - graphs , in the little preface he has written for the new holiday edition of '' Saracinesca '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It speaks ill for the discernment of his readers , and those of the other novelists who have made similar explanations recently : or is it that the realist is really in the saddle to an extent which assumes all romance to be history written small ?

		Much more to the point is the inference of the author here that it is the humanity of the book which has given it twelve years of unfading popularity and now calls forth this admirable two-volume edition with all Mr.
Orson Lowell	PERSON	's delightful photogravures and pen drawings .

		The book is human as human as '' Patient Grisel '' and its persistence in the face of an overwhelming majority of feminine readers indicates less emancipation than many have hoped .

		The Italian character has never been more skilfully interpreted to an alien audience than in the three novels of which this is the first and best ; and this , though not given by Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	among his rea - sons for survival , is assuredly not the least of them .

		Just at this time , when Latin civilization is in apo - gee , it is worth while recalling from the pages of `` Saracinesca '' the half - forgotten fact that all peo - ples are from the same root , and all European peo - ples and their descendants sufficiently close to make the interest of one a concern for all .

		The elaborately illustrated edition of u ,
Janice Meredith	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- attests both the liking of the public for its author , Mr.
Paul Leices	PERSON	- ter
Ford	ORGANIZATION	, and for the Revolutionary times which are commemorated in it .

		A curious bit of history lies in the fact that we are getting nearer our great - great-grandfathers ' days in books in inverse pro- portion to our regard for their precepts in actual life .


Janice	PERSON	has a double set of friends , and the colored medallion portrait which Mrs.
Lillie V. O'Ryan	PERSON	has made of the gently gallant heroine jus - tifies them all .

		Another miniature , of the General
George Washington	PERSON	whose farewell address has come into disrepute among American statesmen of late , is from the
Sharpless	PERSON	original , and serves as frontispiece to the second volume .

		The black-and - white illustrations are by Mr.
Howard Pyleand	PERSON	his pupils , exhibiting all the painstaking attention to the costume and architecture of that time which have always marked this artist 's work .

		The story itself is of sufficient worth to bear these extraneous aids without loss of dignity , the effect being un - usually harmonious .

		More than holiday interest is lent
Charles Reade	PERSON	's '' Peg Woffington '' -LRB-
Doubleday & McClure	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- by Mr.
Austin Dobson	PERSON	's `` Introduction , '' replete as it is with that essayist 's charming erudition respecting eighteenth century people and places .

		If Mr.
Reade	PERSON	idealized an actress who has always had a peculiar charm for the folk on both sides of the footlights , Mr.
Dobson	PERSON	gives us the real woman quite without the adventitious glamour of natural beauty or stage artificiality and both are lovely , with a touch of pathos which makes them lovelier .

		The task for both writers is the easier because of the lack of precise knowledge respecting pretty
Peggy	PERSON	, enabling the artist to fill out the slight sketch which authentic history furnishes with radiant colors from his own palette .

		If her life , as Mr.
Dobson	PERSON	says , was hardly to be ranked as '' either worshipped or blameless , '' it was more and less exciting both love and pity .

		We can hardly , now that this Introduction has been furnished the novel , conceive of the novel without it .

		And the pictures of Mr.
Hugh Thom	PERSON	- son are scarcely less essential , now they have been introduced to us .

		The playwright was careful to keep '' Becky Sharp '' distinct from
Thackeray	PERSON	's `` Vanity Fair , '' but the substantial unity of the two is manifest in what is called the ''
Becky	PERSON	Sharp '' edition of the great '' novel without a hero '' now published by the Harpers .

		Forty-eight photographs of Mr.
Minnie Maddern Fiske	PERSON	and her fellow-players have been reproduced in half-tone for the illustration of the work , the stage costumes and accessories , strictly achronistic , adding to their effectiveness .

		The test is , of course , a severe one ; for not only must the actors conform themselves to the requirements of the stage , but they must also look the parts in re - pose , and in the face of those readers whose pre - possessions are , for example , in favor of
Thackeray	PERSON	's own drawings .

		These latter , lacking as they were
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 495 in some respects , are filled with spirit and are neces - sary for the comprehension of the book ; yet we can imagine the delight with which the author would welcome the sympathy here given by a sister art and its fellow-artists .

		That sterling critic of art , Mr.
Cosmo Monk	PERSON	- house , has performed a most valuable and unusual task in his fine quarto , '' British Contemporary Artists '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		The word `` contemporary , '' describing as it did the series of essays when they were conceived less than
six years ago	DATE	, has ceased to be applicable to
Leighton	LOCATION	,
Millais	PERSON	, and
Burne	PERSON	-
Jones	PERSON	, whose work nevertheless will not be taken as work of the past .

		Mr.
Monkhouse	PERSON	regrets that the principle of seniority gives Mr.
George Fred	PERSON	- erick
Watts	PERSON	the first place : we fail to see the ap - plication when the final pas has been given by the
King of Terrors	ORGANIZATION	to these others even while we agree with his reasons for objection .

		A mystical seven are named in the book , the others being Mr.
William Quiller Orchardson	PERSON	, Sir
Lawrence Alnia	PERSON	-
Tadema	LOCATION	, and Sir
Edward J. Poynter	PERSON	.

		All were , of course , members of the
Royal Academy	ORGANIZATION	.

		The book is illustrated with considerable profusion , full - page engravings from the works and smaller repro - ductions from sketches and studies lending point to the questions raised in the text .

		Incidentally , though this was doubtless part of the critic 's orig - inal intention , there is a tolerably complete survey of the present status of painting in
England	LOCATION	, which makes the work of more than ordinary interest .

		It is one of the chefs d'oeuvre of the season in all re - spects .

		One of the prettiest and freshest of the season 's lighter and more essentially ornamental and pic - torial publications comes to us from
Colorado	LOCATION	from away out in
Colorado	LOCATION	, so far from
Attic Boston	LOCATION	.

		But if
Boston	LOCATION	itself has produced this sea - son anything so pretty and tasteful in its modest kind as the flat octavo volume entitled ``
Colorado	LOCATION	in Color and Song , '' published by Mr.
Frank S. Thayer	PERSON	of
Denver	LOCATION	, we have thus far failed to see it .

		Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	, if we mistake not , is the enter - prising gentleman who several years ago published a book containing , as alleged , photographic views of live wild animals of the region in their native haunts , after negatives secured on the spot by a noted hunter who , in the interests of education and the book trade , kindly consented for a season or so to substitute a camera for his
Winchester	ORGANIZATION	.

		It after - wards leaked out that the animals photographed were stuffed and mounted specimens of indigenous fauna , which had been wheeled out into the rural environs of
Denver	LOCATION	and there appropriately posed before the camera of the `` noted hunter , '' who , be - ing a man of some humor , entered with spirit into Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	's little joke .

		The reviewers of the book generally were `` taken in '' by it ourselves among the number .

		But we bear Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	no malice , and , on the contrary , hasten to say that his present venture is a very attractive one in which there lurks not the slightest possibility of a hoax .

		The native poets represented in it appear to be , with hardly an exception , alive and not stuffed ; and its speci - mens of
Colorado	LOCATION	scenery are as indubitable as grand .

		There are twenty-four full-page plates , in colors , showing Hanging Rock , the
Palisades	LOCATION	,
Gate	LOCATION	- way to the Garden of the Gods , Seven Falls ,
Ute Pass	ORGANIZATION	,
Royal Gorge	ORGANIZATION	,
Manitou	LOCATION	,
Ouray	LOCATION	, Twin Lakes ,
Platte Cafion	LOCATION	,
Cathedral Rocks	ORGANIZATION	, etc. .

		Each plate is printed on heavy paper , and the verses facing and accompanying it are on tissue bond .

		The side-stamp on the cover is a bit of mountain landscape in nat - ural colors set in a gilt frame of Florentine pattern .

		The work is at once a decidedly interesting Colo - rado souvenir and a charming Holiday book .

		Another fine volume of the steadily-growing lux - ury edition of Mr.
George W. Cable	PERSON	's works of fiction -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , '' Les Grandissimes , '' illustrated by Mr.
Albert Herter	PERSON	, is in all respects a worthy example of American book-making at its best .

		A eover design of pond-lilies distinguishes the book externally .

		Within , the essential quality of French life in
Louisiana	LOCATION	has been caught by the artist and reproduced in not less than a score of photo - gravures , carefully conceived , excellently wrought , and fully interpretative of the novel .

		In size , the volume is a large octavo , its proportionate thickness being achieved by the use of heavy paper , making the turning of the leaves a pleasure in itself .

		When the series is completed , Mr.
Cable	PERSON	will have a literary and bibliophilic monument granted to few writers .

		England , seen by the appreciative American eyes of Mr.
C. J. Taylor	PERSON	, whose sketches are published by Mr.
R. H. Russell	PERSON	, is as foreign and as home - like as it must always be to us .

		There are no fewer than eighty large drawings in Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	's collection , nearly all in tone , interpreting the sim - ples and gentles , the city and country , the haunts of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and
Carlyle	PERSON	, and the resorts of ` Arriet and her ` Enery .

		The humor of the work is broad upon occasion , and the social side of English life is brought out very clearly and in marked contrast to the more sorrowful pleasures of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The art of interpreting these dif - ferences in terms common to both peoples is pecu - liarly the province of this interesting and amusing book , for which we are greatly indebted to the artist .

		Why can ' t an Englishman Mr.
Phil May	PERSON	, for example do as much for us ?

		Perhaps when Mr.
William Dean Howells	PERSON	's vari - ous and admirable qualifications as a novelist and prose-artist are considered separately , none of his qualities may take higher place than what may be called his '' happiness . ''

		This shows with more than usual plainness in '' Their Silver Wedding Journey '' -LRB- Harper -RRB- , a luxurious holiday edition of which , in two volumes , now makes its timely appearance .

		To take our old friend
March	DATE	that average
Ameri	PERSON	- can who is the transatlantic Pendennis with all his differences and our good friend Mrs.
March	DATE	, who stands for the most creditable work of modern civ - ilization , the American woman , vingt ans aprbs plus five more , and send them abroad , is a device as 496 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, ingenious as it is interestingly instructive in its re - sults .

		The illustrations for this edition , some in half-tone reproductions from photographs , others from drawings by artists of repute , add to the reality of the work and increase its many charms .

		Mrs.
Elisabeth Luther Gary	PERSON	writes a valuable summary of the work of one of the great English poets , entitling it , ''
Browning	PERSON	, Poet and Man : A Survey '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , choosing the word '' survey , '' as she says , because she has relied rather upon the work of others than on any investigations of her own .

		Tet the work is vigorous at times if not orig - inal ; and gives a tolerably fair collective view of the poet 's virtues and literary faults .

		It is filled with good pictures , most of them portraits of
Brown	PERSON	- ing and his more famous contemporaries and friends , the rest being scenes from his works .

		The book is a worthy commemoration of a life of great accom - plishments and many charms .

		That commingling of art and history which is oftener attempted than realized makes pleasant and profitable reading of `` The Stones of
Paris	LOCATION	in His - tory and Letters '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		It is written by Mr.
Benjamin Ellis Martin	PERSON	and Mrs.
Charlotte M. Mar	PERSON	- tin , quite in the spirit of Mr.
W.C. BrownellV	PERSON	- French Traits , '' and justifying the dedication to that essay - ist .

		The idea of the book is to follow the fragments remaining of the walls of
Philip Augustus	PERSON	, bringing to light half-recalled , half-forgotten relics of the past , ancient , mediaeval , and modern .

		There are eleven several essays in the two volumes , bearing such typical titles as `` The Scholars ' Quarter of the Mid - dle Ages , '' ''
Moliere	PERSON	and his Friends , '' '' The South - ern
Bank	ORGANIZATION	in the
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, '' and `` The
Paris	LOCATION	of Victor Hugo . ''

		Many illustrations add to the interest of the pleasant , chatty volumes , which preserve the literary feeling and charm throughout .

		A reissue of Mr.
Hamilton Wright Mabie	PERSON	's '' My Study Fire '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is welcome at this time or any other .

		The present addition has to commend it further the numerous illustrations from the pencils of those gifted young women , the Misses
Maude Alice	PERSON	and
Genevieve Cowles	PERSON	.

		These pictures take the form common enough to-day , but none the less charming of little symbolic sketches and suggestions scattered through the pages , besides the well-drawn men and women of the narrative whose imaginative portraits for once do not disturb the reader 's ideals .

		To the lover of literature or of life , the volume makes equal appeal .

		If one could have personal acquaintances like the characters in the '' Essays of Elia '' !

		Charles Lamb left the feeling of placid intimacy in his work , and we have gone on making editions of it , year by year , showing the one appreciation of the work we are able to show by reading and re-reading it .

		Just now , Mr.
Augustine Birrell	PERSON	has written an in - troduction and Mr.
Charles E. Brock	PERSON	has made pic - tures for a sumptuous two-volume edition imported by the
Scribners	ORGANIZATION	, differentiated as '' Essays '' and `` Last Essays . ''

		In Mr.
Bin-ell	PERSON	's selection there is a certain appropriateness , since he represents , if any - one , the playfulness and fancifulness of
Elia	ORGANIZATION	himself if one could conceive of an
Elia	ORGANIZATION	in the end of the century !

		Mr.
Robert Barr	PERSON	has gone travelling , and `` The Unchanging East , or , Travels and Troubles in the Orient '' -LRB- Page -RRB- is the two - volume product of his wanderings .

		Mr.
Barr	PERSON	is a good hand at finding amusement and even comparative comfort out of situations otherwise hardly endurable .

		He shows the American 's understanding of foreigners rather than a Briton 's aloofness , and he thus exhibits to his readers the sympathy they do not always find in accounts of Eastern life .

		The
Mediterranean	LOCATION	,
Antioch	LOCATION	,
Damascus	LOCATION	,
Jerusalem	LOCATION	, these form the text for pleasant and profitable discourse .

		The book is fully illustrated , in photogravure , etc. , and has a cover design which is particularly successful .

		Mrs.
Alice Morse Earle	PERSON	's `` Child Life in Colonial Days '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is both a holiday book and a book for children the two being so closely com - bined as to make it equally within either category .

		What it is , the title and Mrs.
Earle	PERSON	's other work of the same genre abundantly indicate .

		A wide read - ing of earlier American history , biography , and cor - respondence , a good sense of fitness and proportion , a sure knowledge of the eternally interesting child - ishness which age can not wither , a keen eye for the picturesque , the bizarre , and the interesting all these things are combined with illustrations attest - ing similar qualities to produce a living whole .

		We have long known our ancestors as heroes ; we are now learning them over again as husbands , wives , fathers , mothers , youths , hobbledehoys , giggling females , '' and babies .

		Will the Filipino of the Twenty-first Century like
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's
New Zea	LOCATION	- lander find in such books an indication of national decay ?

		We should like Mr.
Joseph Jacobs	PERSON	* s `` Tales from Boccaccio '' -LRB- Truslove ,
Hanson & Cotnba	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- better if there were more of them .

		True , among the four chosen for this handsome volume , appear `` Griselda , '' u
Saladin	PERSON	and
Torello	PERSON	, '' and
Isabella	PERSON	, '' two of which gave rise to great English poems .

		But when the translator himself tells us , in a pleasant introduc - tion , that seventy-two of the hundred tales in the Decamerone '' are not more broad than they are long , '' and the connecting links or machinery of the book are quite as free from trespass upon modern convention , why should he so limit himself ?

		Were the turning from Italian to English less successful , the feeling of deprivation would be less strong .

		One compensation is found in Mr.
Byam Shaw	PERSON	's delicate and artistic interpretations of the text , which are both beautiful and profuse .

		Garlands of prose , quite as much as garlands of poetry , are characteristic of the day .

		The latter come , it may be , from the distaste felt for verses by most Americans ; the former , in all probability .

		from the desire to place varied information at the disposal of the reader .

		All such books , like others affording a more or less royal road to learning , are probably enervating in their effect ; but it is still
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		497 difficult to believe this of such a book as '' Great Pictures Described by Great Writers '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The book is compiled by Miss
Esther Singleton	PERSON	, whose `` Turrets , Towers , and Temples '' of last year will be recalled .

		She has drawn freely on the great writers of
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	for her descriptions , trans - lating from the two foreign tongues herself the ex - cerpts needed for her purpose .

		The result is a well-rounded whole , the greatest works of the great - est painters being turned into literature by the greatest writers in
Europe	LOCATION	nearly all of the critics being modern , and many of them living .

		The painters range from
Bordone	LOCATION	and
Botticelli	ORGANIZATION	to Goenze and
Turner	PERSON	, with illustrious examples from
Spain	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	, and
Holland	LOCATION	in profusion ; while Pater and
Ruskin	PERSON	, the De Goncourts and Ste.
Beuve	PERSON	,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, and Thausing , with many more , supply the text .

		There will even be found Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's comment on
Rossetti	PERSON	's '' Lilith '' why not also his sonnet from the `` Heptalogia '' ?

		The final touch of interest is given by a profusion of illustrations of the pictures discussed , of course which contrive to give one an almost adequate idea of their excellence in spite of the process work which has made them possible .

		Good editions of the Sonnets of Shakespeare are nnmerous and varied , but we can recall none more attractive to the eye than that lately issued by the Roy croft Printing Shop of
East Aurora	LOCATION	, N. Y .

		The volume is unillustrated , and contains no Introduc - tion or critical matter of any kind .

		The text is printed in bold-faced type on a fine quality of hand - made paper , and the binding is of plain dark paper boards with back and corners of a rough cinnamon - colored leather .

		The initial letters throughout the book , drawn by Mr.
W. W. Denslow	PERSON	, are colored by hand in the same deft and artistic way that has made this feature of the Roycroft publications such a distinctive one .

		In many respects this is the most satisfactory volume that the Roycrofters have pro- duced as yet , and a choicer Christmas gift for a book lover could hardly be found .

		As artistically beautiful as it is wittily droll , Mr.
Oliver Herford	PERSON	's `` Alphabet of Celebrities '' -LRB- Small ,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has the pictures and letter-press as they appeared in '' Life . ''

		But to these have been added a border and initial letters by Mr.
Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue	PERSON	, with a cover design and end papers by
Miss E. B. Bird	PERSON	, the whole be - ing profusely rubricated .

		That unexpected and almost irreverent turn of the fancy which is char - acteristic of Mr.
Herford	PERSON	's rhymes appears at its best here .

		What could be more ludicrously incon - gruous than this ? ''

		A 's
Albert Edward	PERSON	, well meaning but flighty , Who invited
King Arthur	PERSON	, the blameless and mighty , To meet
Alcibiades	LOCATION	and Aphrodite . ''

		Unless it be the accompanying picture , which shows the British King lowering and the Greek leader leering at the goddess , while the heir apparent stares from eyes absurdly
Guelph	LOCATION	.

		The author of '' Vacation Days in
Hawaii	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	, '' Mr.
Charles M. Taylor , Jr.	PERSON	, has been tak - ing another vacation in
Great Britain	LOCATION	, this time and '' The British Isles through an Opera Glass '' -LRB-
Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- is the pleasant result .

		The title might be held as an indication of a journey with the objects to be viewed held at rather more than arm 's length , but it may be taken to indicate that the author 's camera enables the reader to see what he saw as through an opera-glass .

		The tour began in
France	LOCATION	and extended through
England	LOCATION	,
Scotland	LOCATION	, and Ire - land .

		While there is little new for the traveller in the book , it is freshly told , and not without a cer - tain crispness of impression , such as characterized the former book from the same hand .

		Readers of the illustrated literary magazines have seen from time to time pictures of Mr.
H. Rider Haggard	PERSON	in the guise of a practical student of agri - culture .

		They may now read a book in which this attitude is maintained throughout `` A Farmer 's Year , Being his Commonplace Book for
1898	DATE	'' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- .

		There is no airy pretense about the work , nor writing de haut en bas .

		Mr.
Haggard	PERSON	has evidently been at it long enough to have gained profound respect for tillers of the soil , and his views are practical , set forth month by month in the ap - proved manner of this most ancient art .

		With all the rest , there is a reposeful and pleasantly literary manner , such as we have looked for in vain in this author 's successive novels .

		A combination of the two methods would result , we are convinced , in something better than he has yet done , though this last book is a desirable acquisition in itself .

		Mr.
J. Campbell Phillips	PERSON	has eyes to see for him - self and a pencil to draw '' Plantation Sketches '' -LRB-
Russell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The old South and the new are drawn with comprehension and kindliness , interpreted in - dividually through the negro boys and girls who are to constitute a problem for the next generation to solve or leave alone .

		There is true humor in the sketches humor with the thought of tears at no great distance , and they should serve to give the North a better understanding of what these brave and tender-hearted fellow-citizens of ours really are .

		Miss
Howard Weeden	PERSON	not only draws the Negro , but she sings him as well , in '' Bandanna Ballads '' -LRB-
Doubleday & McClure	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Mr.
Joel Chandler Harris	PERSON	writes a brief introduction , in which he extols the fidelity of the work and its timeliness in catching the old house-servant who was much more '' gentle - folks '' than either his successors in service or in masterhood . ''

		A new generation has arisen , '' says Mr.
Harris	PERSON	, '' and it has become incredulous and skeptical in regard to the traditions and legends of the old plantation in general , and of the old-time quality negro in particular . ''

		This is true in the North as well as the South , and the '' Bandanna Ballads '' will be a treasure to all those families which have enjoyed the perfect devotion of the older kind of servant depicted in them .

		In addition to these bal - lads , which have no such merit in the literary sense 498 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, M belongs to the delightful picture * , the author 's '' Shadows on the Wall , '' which had so marked a success when privately printed , are subjoined .

		`` Kemble 's Sketch Book '' -LRB-
Russell	PERSON	-RRB- contains a score or so of that humorous illustrator 's `` coons , '' together with a sprinkling of other odd types a
Florida	LOCATION	` gfttor hunter , an '' Old Sport , '' an over - seer , a
Kentucky	LOCATION	mountaineer , a Cape Cod ancient mariner or two , and so forth .

		The drawings are rough but expressive , and the publication is as modest in price as in make-up .

		The publications of Mr.
T. B. Mosher	PERSON	for the present season include twelve volumes , six of which are in the '' Brocade '' form and four in the '' Old World '' series , while the other two give us Mr.
J. W. Mackail	PERSON	's translation of the '' Georgics '' of
Virgil	PERSON	as companions to the single volume of the '' Eclogues '' published a year ago .

		The new ''
Bro	PERSON	- cade '' booklets give us two more of the old French romances translated by
William Morris	PERSON	, add a new number to the Pater set of '' Imaginary Portraits , '' and give us also '' Hours of
Spring	DATE	and Wild Flow - ers , '' by
Richard Jeffries	PERSON	, '' Will o * the Mill , '' by
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	, and Dr.
John Brown	PERSON	's ever-delightful ''
Marjorie Fleming	PERSON	. ''

		The new 44 Old World '' books are divided equally among prose and verse .

		The two prose volumes are Miss Alexander 's '' The Story of Ida , '' as introduced by Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	, and Mr.
George Meredith	PERSON	's little - known '' Tale of Chloe . ''

		The two volumes of verse are
Christina Rossetti	PERSON	's ''
Monna Innominata	PERSON	'' and
Stevenson	PERSON	's '' A Child 's Garden of Verses . ''

		Of the mechanical charm of all these publications , and of their peculiar fitness for gift purposes , we have spoken so frequently in the past that there is noth - ing new left to say .

		A pretty and inexpensive gift for a friend of musical tastes would be a copy of Mr.
Henry C. Lahee	PERSON	's < ' Famous Violinists of To-Day and Yester - day '' -LRB-
L. C. Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The volume is daintily bound in white with elaborate peacock and floriated design in gold , and contains ten portraits of famous mextros , Ole Bull ,
Corelli	ORGANIZATION	,
Paganini	ORGANIZATION	,
Joachim	PERSON	,
San	LOCATION	- ret ,
Ysaye	PERSON	, etc. .

		The writer has endeavored to give a '' bird 's - eye view '' of the most celebrated violin - ists from the earliest times to the present day , rather than a detailed account of the very few ; and those who have won fame as public performers have been selected in preference to those who were best known as teachers .

		There is a general Introduction , a chapter on Famous Quartettes , and a
Chronological Table	ORGANIZATION	.

		The little book is pleasantly and intelli - gently written , biography , anecdote , and criticism being blended in due proportion .

		We own that we have always been rather imper - vious to the pictorial fan of the late
M. A. Woolf	ORGANIZATION	.

		It always appeared to as a little flat , and of the sort usually made in
England	LOCATION	for home consump - tion .

		Mr.
Woolf	PERSON	s specialty as a humorist was the drawing of very diminutive and supernaturally rag - ged and `` slummy '' children , and making them talk -LRB- by means of a line or so of text underneath -RRB- like grown-up people in flourishing circumstances .

		But that Mr.
Woolf	PERSON	had his admirers is undeniable ; and to all such the flat oblong quarto entitled Sketches of Lowly Life in a
Great City	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , and con - taining over 150 of his drawings , will appeal .

		Most of the pictures are selected from the artist 's contri - butions to `` Life '' and `` Judge , '' but some of them have never before been published .

		The Biograph - ical Note informs us that Mr.
Woolf	PERSON	was born in
England	LOCATION	.

		We suspected it .


Sidney Lanier	PERSON	's study of a mocking-bird , in the best manner of Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	or Mrs.
Miller	PERSON	, is brought out in a most elaborate form by the
Scrib	PERSON	- ners .

		This accurately picturesque story of a bird , from near the egg until , like most wild things , it died by violence , has its virtues enhanced by the combined art and industry of Mr.
A. R. Dugmore	PERSON	, who made repeated photographic studies of mock - ing birds at various ages , finally coloring the best of these and using them as illustrations here .

		A brief comment on the lamented
Lanier	PERSON	's habit in regard to living nature is prefixed by his son , Mr.
Charles Day Lanier	PERSON	; while the book closes with the little-known sonnets `` To Our Mocking - Bird , Died of a Cat ,
May , 1878	DATE	, '' by way of lending a final charm .

		That there should be demand enough for
Moore	PERSON	's '' Lalla Rookh '' to warrant putting forth a super - illustrated edition of that masterpiece of senti - mentality at this time , will be a surprise to many .

		The beauty of the edition -LRB-
Dana Estes	PERSON	-RRB- is marked enough to justify its existence , if only for the pic - tures .

		The artists contributing to this result in - clude Messrs.
Kenyon Cox	PERSON	,
W. H. Low	PERSON	,
F. S. Church	PERSON	,
Frank Myrick	PERSON	,
W. L. Taylor	PERSON	, and many more .

		The book is substantially a re-issue of the edition of fifteen years ago .

		An artistic , quaintly fancied little publication , with a distinctive savor of the book-stall or other haunt of the Nimrod of the old and curious in book - making , is `` The Kings ' Lyrics '' -LRB-
R. H. Russell	PERSON	-RRB- , being a selection of lyrical poems of the reigns of Kings
James I.	PERSON	and
Charles I.	PERSON	, together with
Dray	PERSON	- ton 's Ballad of Agin court .

		Mr.
Fitzroy Carring	PERSON	- ton is the editor .

		The selections are made with taste ; but why has Mr.
Carrington	PERSON	, especially in a Caroline anthology in which so much space is given to poems of a religious cast , entirely omitted
Vaughan	PERSON	who , to our thinking , is , at his inspired best , almost better than any of his fellows at their best .

		There are nine selections from
Herbert	LOCATION	, and four from
Crashaw	ORGANIZATION	.

		Campion ,
Carew	PERSON	,
Drummond	PERSON	,
Herrick	PERSON	,
Lovelace	PERSON	,
Quarles	PERSON	,
Shirley	PERSON	, Suckling , and Wither are liberally represented .

		There are por - traits of the two kings , and of most of the poets ; and the pleasant suggestion of archaism is carried into the typography .

		Mr.
Richard Harding Davis	PERSON	's publishers have dealt nnally with his fiction .

		Anything more en - ticing than the six pocketable little volumes , in their flexible bindings of olive-green leather stamped in gold with title and design , it would be difficult
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 499 to imagine .

		The print is handsome and the paper of good quality , and each volume contains an etched frontispiece .

		The titles comprise : ''
Gallegher	PERSON	, '' '' Soldiers of Fortune , '' '' The King 's Jackal , '' '' The Lion and the Unicorn , '' and '' Cinderella . ''

		Mr.
Samuel Minturn Peck	PERSON	, the American golfers ' laureate , has supplied the seven sprightly poems of the links that form the text of the showy flat quarto entitled '' The Golf Girl '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , and Miss
Maud Humphrey	PERSON	is responsible for the accompanying colored plates .

		Miss
Humphrey	PERSON	's pictures are bright and pleasing , and we rather think they are portraits .

		If such be the case , we beg leave to compliment her on her taste in selecting her models .

		The young man who '' golfs '' should look up this pretty publication in the course of his Christmas shopping . ''

		Famous Actors of the Day in
America	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Page -RRB- , like its predecessor dealing with the actresses , is from the pen of Mr.
Lewis C. Strang	PERSON	. '

		In brief space it sets forth the virtues of twenty-five men , representing all the living generations , from Mr.
Joseph Jefferson	PERSON	to Mr.
Otis Skinner	PERSON	, in the history of the American stage .

		Counterfeit presentments of these brilliant players , generally in some one of their favorite roles , eke out the characterizations of the text , which are sound rather than brilliant .

		Mr.
Strang	PERSON	would have us think he had left behind him the blandishments of the theatrical advance agent ; nevertheless he has preserved a portion of that scintillating functionary 's vocabulary to his own misdoing in sentences here and there . ''

		Cupid and Coronet '' -LRB-
Russell	PERSON	-RRB- is a little story told in pictures with a thread of little needed text by Mr.
Malcolm A. Strauss	PERSON	.

		It is a port - folio book after the manner of Mr.
Charles Dana Gibson	PERSON	.

		It would hardly be fair to assume that it would not have been done at all if it were not for Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	; but it can not well be imagined other - wise .

		The author of the book whose extended title has been shortened by use into plain ''
Mary Powell	PERSON	'' may well rejoice in the beautiful printing of '' The Colloquies of Edward Oaborne '' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- , with its ten drawings by Mr.
John Jel	PERSON	- licoe .

		The book has added to its own merit these skilfully executed illustrations , fine paper , beautiful type and printing , rubricated title-page , and all the careful detail which make a finished work of the printer 's art .

		The more men find themselves in the unnatural world of city streets and city clangor , the more they turn with longing to the mild pleasures of the field and garden .

		It was so in imperial
Rome	LOCATION	, it is true of unimperial
New York	LOCATION	and
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		So `` A World in a Garden '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mrs.
R. Neish	PERSON	, is a welcome addition to a library none too rich in georgics .

		The book is something more than mere horticulture .

		It has the life of man , with its pleasures and pains , uncertainties and compensations , bound up in the conduct of the friendly flowers .

		The photo - gravure illustrations are exceptionally charming .

		Messrs.
Little	PERSON	,
Brown , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish in a single small volume , delicately bound in white and gold , '' Poems by
Keats	PERSON	and
Shelley	PERSON	. ''

		The selections from
Keats	PERSON	are : '' La Belle Dame Sans Merci , '' ''
Isabella	PERSON	, '' '' The Eve of St.
Agnes	PERSON	, '' and '' Lamia '' ; those from
Shelley	PERSON	are : '' The Cloud , '' '' To a Sky - lark , '' '' Ode to the West Wind , '' '' The Sensitive Plant , '' `` The Witch of Atlas . ''

		The text is clearly printed on light-glazed paper .

		There are a number of drawings , full-page and wash , by Mr.
Edmund H. Garrett	PERSON	, whose work is pretty and graceful as usual .

		But the frontispiece of ''
Isabella	PERSON	, '' it must be admitted , is in our poor judgment a sad thing , and a quite libellous conception of that lugubrious damsel .

		The Lycius -LRB- p. 92 -RRB- is much better , and the '' water-lilies , '' on page 42 , is as charming as unpretentious .

		Mr.
Elbert Hubbard	PERSON	's `` Little Journeys to the Homes of Celebrated Painters '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is a bright and chatty little book , packed with anecdotes and racy ana , and not devoid of solid information , which is conveyed in a colloquial and popular style , sometimes a thought too free-and-easy to fit the subject .

		Ten painters are treated :
M. Angelo	PERSON	,
Rembrandt	ORGANIZATION	,
Rubens	PERSON	,
Meissonier	PERSON	,
Titian	ORGANIZATION	,
Van Dyck	LOCATION	,
Fortuny	LOCATION	,
Ary Scheffer	PERSON	,
Millet	LOCATION	,
Reynolds	PERSON	,
Landseer	PERSON	, and Dor .

		Mr.
Hubbard	PERSON	's book is very liberally and very pleasingly illustrated with portraits of the painters and choice examples of their work .

		The early life of old
New York	LOCATION	has yielded ma - terial for a number of pleasant volumes , and Mrs.
Amelia E. Barr	PERSON	has produced such a one in '' Trin - ity Bells '' -LRB-
J. F. Taylor & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The work has a charming little Dutch maiden for a heroine , and some stirring episodes are added from our wars with the Algerian corsairs in the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	.

		There are sixteen full-page illustrations , and the volume has a pretty cover design showing the
Trinity	ORGANIZATION	bells whose silvery music rings through the story .

		`` Legends of
Switzerland	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the unpretentious title of a fourth volume of Miss
H. A. Guerber	PERSON	's series dealing with the myths which have gathered about the sturdy little republic and its various cantons .

		History and myth are here mixed in unequal measures , the realms of art and nature being drawn on for the accompanying pic - tures in half-tone .

		So pure a republican democracy as this deserves American study and sympathy , and both can be given it by means of this pleasant work .

		That tour de force of Mr.
Rudyard Kipling	PERSON	, '' The Brushwood Boy , '' is issued in a small volume by
Messrs. Doubleday & McClnre	ORGANIZATION	, illustrated by Mr.
Orson Lowell	PERSON	with his usual artistic discrimina - tion .

		The plates , which have genuine worth , suffer somewhat in the printing , those interspersed through the text not showing with the clearness which was evidently intended .

		The story is an evident one , of course , and requires no exegesis , pictorial or verbal ; but it is the gainer by such work as this .

		The rapidity with which the modern world changes is shown by nothing more clearly than the 500 THE DIAL -LSB-

Helen M. James	PERSON	illus - trate * Mr.

Charles Dickens	PERSON	built his great novels .

		The work leaves some things to be desired , largely through the hero-worship which Mr.
Allbut	PERSON	permits him * .

		It .

		Dickens 's place in literature is sure , and enthusiasm is permissible .

		Here , however , the insistent use of The Master '' and similar terms carries it to the point of sentimentality .

		The second series of '' Some Colonial Mansions '' -LRB-
Coates	PERSON	-RRB- is bound uniformly with the first , and re - sembles it closely in plan and scope .

		Mr.
Thomas Allen Glenn	PERSON	still acts as editor , which seems to be too slight a title to indicate all his multifarious ac - tivities .

		Not only does he write historical sketches of leading families in
America	LOCATION	before the Revolu - tion , preparing in several instances genealogies and lists of living descendants of them , but he describes the houses they lived in , including the Washingtons at
Mount Vernon	LOCATION	, the Jeffersons at Munticello .

		the
Rawles	PERSON	at
Laurel Hill	ORGANIZATION	, the
Philipses	LOCATION	at
Philips	ORGANIZATION	- borough , the
Waynes	PERSON	at
Wayneaborough	LOCATION	, and the Prestons ,
Schnylers	ORGANIZATION	, and
Macphersons	ORGANIZATION	.

		The book is accurate and painstaking , and the work as a whole promises to attain a high place among recent historical researches .

		Mr.
Charles Keeler	PERSON	writes and Miss
Louise Kee	PERSON	- ler decorates `` A Season 's Sowing '' -LRB-
A. M. Robert	PERSON	- son -RRB- , a book of quatrains and couplets , nearly all with didactic purpose .

		The book is unusually well executed ; the press work -LRB- done in
San Francisco	LOCATION	-RRB- commending it to all those who like white paper and black ink properly applied thereto .

		The deco - rations , too , deserve much praise ; but the illustra - tion by which is meant the figure-drawing more particularly is not so happy nor of equal merit As a work of western art , taken in all its bearings , it deserves many encomiums , and the metropolis of the
Pacific States	LOCATION	is to be congratulated for mak - ing it possible .

		A pretty , well-planned introduction to
Raphael	PERSON	a Raphael primer , one may call it is the modest little volume of the '' Riverside Art Series , '' compiled by Miss
Entelle M. Hurll	PERSON	, containing a frontispiece portrait of the painter , together with half-tone reproductions of fifteen of his pictures , with general introduction and running interpreta - tion and commentary -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		The subjects selected for illustration are largely such as have a certain narrative or literary interest , the portraits being ignored and the Madonnas but slightly repre - sented , while the text has only the modest aim of making the pictures intelligible .

		Hi.-toncal data are relegated to the tables , and the Introduction is intended for teachers , with whom the volume should find favor .

		A brace of rather taking and fairly practical pic - torial calendars come to us from Mr.
R. H. Ii	PERSON	, i -- rll : the - ` Zodiac Calendar , '' with pictuies by Mr.
Ches	PERSON	-
ter Loomis	PERSON	, and `` A Revolutionary Calendar , '' with pictures by Mr.
Ernest C. Peixotto	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Loomis	PERSON	's work is in comic vein ; and his up-to-date handling of our old zodiacal friends .

		Aquarius ,
Pisces	LOCATION	,
Tau	PERSON	- rus , Cancer , and
Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is sufficiently amusing .

		Pat - riotism is Mr.
Peixotto	PERSON	's refuge -LRB- we do n't mean to be personal -RRB- , and he has adorned each of the twelve sizable cards of his calendar with pictures supposed to illustrate such events as
Paul Revere	PERSON	's Ride , the
Lexington	LOCATION	and Bunker Hill fights , the Retreat from
Long Island	LOCATION	, the Surrender of
Cornwallis	LOCATION	, etc. .

		As patriotism of the '' strenuous '' order is in the air just now , Mr.
Peixotto	PERSON	's stirring almanac will doubt - less find many admirers .

		and Action .

		BOOKS FOR THE YOUNG .

		IL From the books for the yonng received 8 ' nce tne ' n8ta ' ment treated in THE DIAL for
December 1	DATE	, it is still possible to make a selection which will be all that the childish heart desires , no matter what the age of the person fortunate enough to possess it .

		Indeed , these books remaining , though fewer in numbers , are of an even higher stand - ard of excellence , indicating either more care in their preparation , speaking broadly , or that the best have been saved for the last .

		When we `` oldsters '' look upon these marvels of book-making , it is with a double sigh : of regret that we were not so favored in our own days of complete appreciation and unjaded tastes , and of wonder as to what manner of book will be turned out for our children 's children a long generation hence .

		Among really notable literary achieve - ments , addressed to youne people and their J elders rather than to children , '' bpanish Peggy '' -LRB- Stone -RRB- , by Mrs.
Mary Hartwell Catherwood	PERSON	, is to be given very high place .

		It is an account of the boyhood of
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	at
New Salem	LOCATION	, and such an account as quite puts the formal biographies of the last few years to shame , being idealized into beauty while retaining all the rugged fact that makes the great emancipator the hero of the common people .

		Beside this is Mr.
Hamlin Garland	PERSON	's '' Boy Life on the Prairie '' -LRB- Mac-mi I Inn -RRB- , a book in which the author is much more at home than he was in telling what little girls did under somewhat similar circumstances .

		The story of the circus is what any boy -LRB- and most men as well -RRB- would call '' bully . ''

		Of a similar sort , treating of hunt - ing , fishing , and all manner of out-of-door life , is the book '' .1 list About a Boy '' -LRB- Stone -RRB- , written by the Mr.
W. S. Phillips	PERSON	who is best known under his pen-name of '' 1 Comancho . ''

		It is health and f reshness com - bined .

		Certain to recall Uncle
Remus	PERSON	are the tales gathered by a
Jamaica	LOCATION	girl ,
Miss Pamela Column Smith	ORGANIZATION	, from the negroes of the
West Indies	LOCATION	, and now published with her own illiiHtrations under the name of the '' Annaiicy Stories '' -LRB-
Russell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		They show folk-lore at its best .

		Mr.
Gelett Burgess	PERSON	prefixes a touching essay on `` The Cidivation of Inanimate Things for Sceptic Parents '' to `` The Lively City o ' Ligg '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , which he has written and illustrated .

		An ap - peal to the tastes of all sorts and ages of men is thus made , as in the ease of `` The Lark .

		* ' That President
David Starr Jordan	PERSON	should have told stories of his two
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 501 children , Knight and
Barbara	PERSON	, and that these , with pic - tures made by those children , should now be published as '' The Book of Knight and Barbara '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , are bits of good-fortune wholly unexpected .

		There will be found in the numerous tales of which the book is made up some old friends with new faces aud some new friends as well . ''

		Pierrette '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- is a lovely little story of a prince who was lost and found , told by Mr.
Henry de Vere Stacpoole	PERSON	, with illustrations by Mr.
Charles Robinson	PERSON	.

		Loveliness is also the characteristic of Miss
Gertrude Smith	PERSON	's pretty book , '' The Wonder - ful Stories of
Jane	PERSON	and John '' -LRB- Stone -RRB- , for which
Miss Alice Woods	ORGANIZATION	has provided color sketches of more than ordinary merit After the manner of
Lewis Carroll	PERSON	, Mrs.
Sheila E. Braine	PERSON	describes the doings of '' The Princess of Hearts '' -LRB- imported by Scribuer -RRB- , the draw - ings being by Miss
Alice B. Woodward	PERSON	.

		The resem - blance is more than adventitious .

		Quite of its own kind , and a fitting sequel to her former book , '' Wabeno the Magician '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is an interestingly fanciful rendering of natural scenes and objects by Mrs.
Mabel Osgood Wright	PERSON	, with admirable pictures by Mr.
Joseph M. Gleeson	PERSON	.

		Rhymes , Books with rhymes and pictures , which ap - and pictures peal to the adult through one and the child with , them .

		through the other , are not uncommon , and certainly serve a useful purpose .

		Probably the first place should be awarded for originality to Miss
Carolyn Wells	PERSON	's `` Jingle Book '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , for which Mr.
Oliver Herford	PERSON	has made the drawings .

		It more than justifies its name , for what is thought to be the best alliterative jingle in the language here has place , run - ning as follows : ''
Betty Botta	PERSON	bought some butter ; ` but , ' said she , ` this butter 's bitter !

		If I put it in my batter it will make my batter bitter , but a better bit o ' butter will but make my batter better . '

		Then she bought a bit o ' butter better than the bitter butter , made her bitter batter better .

		So ' t was better
Betty Botta	PERSON	bought a bit o ' better butter ! ''

		This out-pipers Peter Piper ! ''

		A Moral Alphabet in Words of From One to Seven Syllables '' -LRB-
Edward Arnold	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is a repeti - tion of the success of the '' Bad Child 's Book of Beasts '' and '' More Beasts for Worse Children '' of two and three years ago .

		The words are by '' H. B. '' -LRB- Mr.
Hilaire Belloc	PERSON	-RRB- and the out-of-drawings by '' B. T. B. '' Not in the least for children , though hardly for any - body else , are the '' Ruthless Rhymes for Heartless Homes '' -LRB-
Edward Arnold	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Colonel
D. Streamer	PERSON	, with pictures by `` G. H. '' It seems to be American humor strained through British intelligences , much to its worsening Any of Mr.
William Nicholson	PERSON	's pic - tures are certain to be welcomed , and '' The Square Book of Animals '' -LRB-
Russell	PERSON	-RRB- is no exception to the rest , though the designs for it were done in
1896	DATE	.

		But why should Mr.
Nicholson	PERSON	's excellent ideas serve as a vehicle to carry , first , the worst rhymes Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	ever wrote , secondly , the worst rhymes Mr.
Henley	PERSON	ever wrote , and , thirdly and finally here , the worst rhymes Mr.
Arthur Waugh	PERSON	ever wrote ?

		Why not try the artist so/us ?

		Both rhymes and illustrations are by Mrs.
Sarah Noble	PERSON	-
Ives	PERSON	in `` Songs of the Shining Way '' -LRB-
Russell	PERSON	-RRB- , a thin but pleasing book which would have been improved mechanically by the use of a paper more nearly opaque .

		A single person also serves both for draughtsman and rhymester in ''
Peter Newell	PERSON	's Pictures and Rhymes '' -LRB- Harper -RRB- , and the combination of Mr.
Newell	PERSON	's talents is most successful . ''

		In Case of Need -LRB- These May Come Handy -RRB- , 5 ' published by
Small	ORGANIZATION	,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, Pictures chiefly .

		with the pictures , rhymes , and lettering by Mr.
Ralph Bergengren	PERSON	, is a sort of `` Slovenly Peter '' for adults , its modernity attested by the use of rubaiyat for the verses .

		Both elaborate and witty , the book is eminently suitable for a bachelor 's Christmas gift , always a diffi - cult thing to acquire , while it will serve a useful pur - pose with the married as well .

		There are moral head - ings in the '' New England Primer '' style , and such sage advice as this , eutitled '' Those Who Postpone Will Later Groan '' : `` Remember , Friend , the task that it is right to meet at its own moment , do not slight : He who neglects his morn-appointed shave oft finds scant time to shave himself at night . ''

		In every way commending itself , `` Child Verse : Poems Grave and Gay '' -LRB- Small ,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a delightful book of real poetry from the pen of the Reverend
John Ban	PERSON	- ister
Tabb	PERSON	.

		Almost unconscious piety is an unusual note here sounded most worthily .

		Without verses , but filled with pictures , books of the sort represented by Mr.
Frank Verbeck	PERSON	's `` The Three Bears '' -LRB-
Russell	PERSON	-RRB- are as funny as caricatures of animals funny in them - selves can possibly be .

		Mr.
Albert Bigelow Paine	PERSON	, in - ventor of the `` Dumpies '' and some other laughable things , has told the story of the ` possum , the coon , the rabbit , and the crow '' In the Deep Woods '' -LRB-
Russell	PERSON	-RRB- , to the pictures by Mr.
J. M. Conde	PERSON	'' .

		Mr.
Conde	PERSON	'' , too , provides the humorous drawings for Mr.
C. F. Carter	PERSON	's book , '' Katooticut , or The Rooster Who Wanted to Be Rich '' -LRB-
Russell	PERSON	-RRB- , in which a dragon , a genie , and a nightmare flourish with the more usual types of crea - tion . ''

		Animal Jokes '' -LRB-
Russell	PERSON	-RRB- , the jokes by Mr.
A. Crawford	PERSON	and the reproductions of the animals by Mrs.
M. Baker	PERSON	-
Baker	PERSON	, is a very funny book indeed .

		What might be styled reversed silhouettes make up the pic - tures in '' The Sculptor Caught Napping : A Book for the Children 's Hour '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- .

		These are done by Mrs.
Jane E. Cook	PERSON	, who cuts her pictures from card - board , traces the necessary detail on them with a stil - etto , and presents them here against a deep purple background .

		The effect is that of low relief , and very pleasant as well as very novel .

		The subjects treated are those of the nursery , generally speaking .

		Another Of t ne various books treating of the naval group of aspect of the war with
Spain	LOCATION	, Mr.
Willis	PERSON	war book * .

		j
Abbot	ORGANIZATION	's `` Blue Jackets of 1898 '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is by far the most accurate and the most interestingly written .

		Both bo ^ s and men will be the gainers by its perusal .

		Mr.
William O. Stoddard	PERSON	, who wrote one of the first of the books of the late war , now has published a volume containing three stories , of which the third is a wrecker 's tale , rather than a warrior 's .

		It is named from the first of these , `` Running the Cuban Blockade '' -LRB- Stone -RRB- , and is thril - ling and well told throughout .

		Ruth
Ogden	PERSON	-LRB- Mrs.
Charles W. Ide	PERSON	-RRB- tells how patriotic small boys and girls could be during the recent war , in '' Loyal Hearts and True '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Doubtless the little Spanish children were quite as loyal on their side .

		The rediscovery of our ancestors continues in Mrs.
Agnes Carr Sage	PERSON	's `` A Little Daughter of the Revolution '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , illus - trated by Miss
Mabel L. Humphrey	PERSON	, wherein quite small children meet the heroes of that day Revolu - tionary sea-fighters begin , and the sailors of the Span - ish war end , Mr.
George Gibbs	PERSON	's `` Pike and Cutlass '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , thus presenting a connected picture of the national navy .

		Two things about the book are not quite comprehensible : Why does the author take pains to THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, mention every sailor who did anything during the last war with the solitary exception of Admiral
Schley	PERSON	?

		And why does he , in the pictures be drew for the book , depict `` Fighting Bob ''
Evans	PERSON	in the uniform of the war of
1812	DATE	?

		Were there conning towers in those days ?

		Mr.
Gibbs	PERSON	makes the pictures for Mr.
M. J. Canavan	PERSON	's
Ben Comee	PERSON	, a Tale of
Rogers	ORGANIZATION	's Rangers , 1758-60 '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which goes back of the Revo - lution quite a distance , but revolves around
Lexington	LOCATION	as a centre .

		One long step farther back is Mrs.
Beulah Marie Dix	PERSON	's '' Soldier Rigdale , How be Sailed in the Mayflower , and How he Served Miles Stand ish '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- .

		The pictures are by Mr.
Reginald B. Birch	PERSON	, and the book is of historical interest ' With
Perry	PERSON	on Lake Erie '' -LRB-
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a good story of the second war of independence , told by Mr.
James Otis	PERSON	.

		It has the merit of introducing the reader to the facts prelim - inary to the great battle .

		Concerned with the Revo - lution again is `` An Unknown Patriot '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Frank Samuel Child	PERSON	.

		It is instructive to see the former hatred of
Great Britain	LOCATION	slipping away in all these books ; we are apparently as anxious to please the mother country now as we used to be anxious when she gave us dispraise in days gone by .

		Dr.
Gordon Stables	PERSON	is belated in point of time with his '' Remember the
Maine	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- , and , we trust , in point of sentiment as well .

		The book is chiefly interesting as showing a British point of view .

		Never failing in its appeal to all English-speaking boys and men , the life of Sir
Francis Drake	PERSON	carries a tradition for seamanship and daring down the ages .

		Mr.
James Barnes	PERSON	has rather followed the beaten path of the bold captain 's biog - raphers than marked one out for himself , as he has so often ; but ``
Drake	PERSON	and his Yeomen '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a good book nevertheless .

		Why ca n't Mr.
Barnes	PERSON	write another and tell of
Drake	PERSON	's singeing the King of
Spain	LOCATION	's beard ?

		If Mr.
George Riddle	PERSON	had given a little more American verse in his `` Modern Reader and Speaker '' -LRB- Stone -RRB- , it would have left nothing to be desired .

		There is surely no rea - son why boys should not have a chance at the good things of to-day as well as at those of day before yes - terday .

		That it is vastly more amusing to keep ani - mals and watch them than to shoot them for specimens , is the humane lesson of Mr.
Wardlaw Kennedy	PERSON	's '' Beasts , Thumb-Nail Studies in Pets '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Most of the beasts are reptiles , and a more interesting book could hardly be found .

		Miss
Charlotte M. Yonge	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- familiar name -RRB- writes '' The Herd Boy and his Her - mit '' -LRB-
Whittaker	PERSON	-RRB- , a characteristic story of mediaeval piety , for which Mr.
W. S. Staoey	PERSON	provides some inter - esting pictures . ''

		Phil and I '' -LRB-
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a story of an English boy and the heir of an exiled French noble - man during the Napoleonic wars .

		The times and the story are well set forth Real mischief - making boys and girls have their lives portrayed by
E. Nesbit	PERSON	-LRB- Mrs.
Hubert Bland	PERSON	-RRB- in `` The Story of the Treasure Seek - ers '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The children were not looking for mere gold .

		Messrs.
Gordon Browne	PERSON	and
Lewis Baumer	PERSON	make the pictures for the book in all sympathy Boys at school and their capacity for dramatization afford the fun in M
Mobsley	ORGANIZATION	's Mohicans '' -LRB-
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Harold Avery	PERSON	.

		The book is praiseworthy Another of the unwearied Mr.
James Otis	PERSON	's books , and the third of his '' Telegraph '' series , is '' Telegraph Tom 's Ventures '' -LRB-
Werner	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Crime and melodrama are its portion .

		Rather teaching the cruelty of slaughtering birds for A HUU of Vfy thing , For little chitdrtn .

		decorative purposes than indicating any great knowl - edge of ornithology , ''
Dickey Downey	PERSON	: The Autobiog - raphy of a Bird '' -LRB-
A. J. Rowland	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mrs.
Virginia Sharpe Patterson	PERSON	, is still a necessary book .

		Intended primarily for children , it deserves circulation among their elders , so long as dead birds are used in millin - ery .

		A fourth edition of Miss
Maud Menefee	PERSON	's `` Child Stories from the Masters '' -LRB- privately printed -RRB- will be welcomed by the intelligent everywhere .

		It is more beautiful than its predecessors by a cover design from Mr.
Leyendecker	PERSON	's clever pencil ; but its charmingly simple account of the great masterpieces makes it almost indispensable in teaching children the nobility of art '' A Life of St
Paul	PERSON	for the Young '' -LRB-
Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr.
George Ludiugton Weed	PERSON	, is a direct and
Chris	PERSON	- tianly sympathetic account of the great missionary and dogmatist , not above the grasp of the childish mind '' Ways of Wood Folk '' -LRB- Ginu -RRB- is an instructive and pleasantly written account of forest animals and animal life , by Mr.
William J. Long	PERSON	.

		The really interesting books for smaller children may be beaded by that excellent publication , `` The Little Folks ' Illustrated Annual '' -LRB-
Dana Estes	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Both in prose and verse , the selections are of the sort which can not fail to entertain the youngsters .

		`` The Little Browns '' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- are a wholesome and happy set of small chil - dren for whose acquaintance we are indebted to Miss
Mabel E. Wotton	PERSON	.

		A real burglar comes upon the scene in the guise of an uncle , and the children play detective in the most approved manner Another housebreaker is the hero of `` The Burglar 's Daughter '' -LRB-
Jordan	PERSON	,
Marsh & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , written by Miss
Margaret Pen	PERSON	rose and illustrated by Mr.
Frank T. Merrill	PERSON	.

		This hero is saved by his little girl , whose room he enters under a misap - prehension , discovering his inadvertence when he is about to take a present he had made her .

		Mrs.
Moles	PERSON	- worth is the author of '' This and That , a Tale for Two Tinies '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , the pictures being by Mr.
Hugh Thomson	PERSON	in an earlier manner .

		The book has the merit of all Mrs.
Molesworth	PERSON	's work , and shows how real and how trivial the grief and trouble of the child always is .

		Four of the '' Nister '' books are published by Duttou on this side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	: '' The Voyage of the
Mary Adair	PERSON	, '' by Miss
Frances E. Crompton	PERSON	, with pictures by Miss
Evelyn Lanse	PERSON	; `` Tattine , '' by Mrs.
Ide	PERSON	-LRB- `` Ruth Ogden '' -RRB- ; '' Honor Bright , a Story of the Days of King Charles , '' by Mrs.
Mary C. Roswell	PERSON	, illustrated by
Miss E. Stuart Hardy	PERSON	; and `` The
Kingfisher	ORGANIZATION	's Egg , and Other Stories , '' of which the first is by Mrs.
L. T. Meade	PERSON	, and the others by Miss
Ellis Walton	PERSON	, Miss Ger - aldine
R. Glasgow	PERSON	, and several more .

		All have attrac - tive cover designs in bright colors , and are filled with pictures .

		`` Mother Duck 's Children '' -LRB-
Russell	PERSON	-RRB- is by ''
Gugu	PERSON	, '' and has decided merit . ''

		Master Martin '' -LRB-
Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- is all that the title of dignity implies , and there is also a child Sir
Theodore	PERSON	in the book to give it an air .

		It is written by Mrs.
Emma Marshall	PERSON	.

		Miss
Amy E. Blanchard	PERSON	, purveyor of pleasant and innocuous tales for the young , finds a congenial theme in `` A Sweet Little Maid '' -LRB-
Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- , who is as sweet as any small child may lawfully be : almost sweeter .

		`` Old Father Gander ; or , The Better Half of Mother Goose '' -LRB- Page -RRB- is a book of jingling and rather elderly rhymes accompanied by any quantity of pictures in color and in black and white .

		Mr.
Walter Scott Howard	PERSON	is the person responsible for it all .

		Of more importance and rather different in its appeal , '' Little Leather Breeches ,
1899	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 503 and Other Southern Rhymes '' -LRB-
J. F. Taylor & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a collection of original verses , folk lore tales in rhyme , negro songs , street cries , and other matter from the other side of
Mason	ORGANIZATION	and
Dixon	PERSON	's line .

		The numerous colored pictures are from the hand of the collector and rhyme - ster , Mr.
Francis P. Wightman	PERSON	.

		No book for the holidays , whether for Ola favorites young or old , has more attractiveness than The Golden Age , '' Mr.
Maxfield Parrish	PERSON	providing most admirable pictures for Mr.
Kenneth Grahame	PERSON	's delicious text , and Mr.
John Lane	PERSON	giving it a sumptuous dress worthy of its literary and pictorial content .

		It is a book to be treasured by bibliophiles .

		As a worthy companion to '' A Hundred Fables of ^
Esop	ORGANIZATION	, '' Mr.
Percy J. Billinghurst	PERSON	illustrates '' A Hundred Fables of La Fontaine '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- , making a most desir - able pair of minor classics .

		Another reprint , appropri - ate for very good children indeed , is Swift 's '' Gulliver 's Travels '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- , with pictures by Mr.
Herbert Cole	PERSON	and the text duly bowdlerized .

		England in the

		The titles are properly classified in departments , and the triple index entries by author , subject , and title make everything instantly accessible .

		The volume has four hundred pages , well printed , and is a very creditable bibliographical production .

		Professor
William Macdonald	PERSON	's `` Select Charters and other Documents Illustrative of American History '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- covers the pre-Revolutionary period , and places within the hands of the student a great mass of material not easily accessible otherwise .

		It affords another indication of the praiseworthy tendency , so con - spicuous of late in our educational literature , to bring ; original documents to the hands of our teachers .

		Mr.
Henry S. Pancoast	PERSON	's `` Standard English Poems '' -LRB-
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- is a compilation intended for school use in connec - tion with any text-book of the history of ourliterature ^ although , of course , prepared with special reference to the author 's own excellent manual of the subject .

		The selections range from '' Chevy Chase '' to Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's '' Recessional , '' which latter is the only example given from any poet now living .

		The book has seven hun - dred and fifty pages , of which about two hundred are notes and other editorial matter .

		The
Bibliographical Society of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	was organized on the
evening	TIME	of
Dec. 8	DATE	, at a meeting held in the
Public Library	ORGANIZATION	rooms .

		Its membership comprises rep - resentatives of the libraries of the city , of the
Univer	ORGANIZATION	- 504 TIIK DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, sity and other educational institutions , of the publishing interests , and of the general book-loving element .

		public .

		It is a national rather than a local association in scope , baring the field to itself as far as the
United States	LOCATION	is concerned .

		The aims of the Society are stated as follows : 1 , to encourage and promote bibliographical study and research ; 2 , to compile and publish special bibliographies ; and , 3 , to arouse interest in the history of books and libraries .

		Mr.
William S. Lord	PERSON	some months ago asked two hundred representative literary people '' to send him lists of twenty-five of the best short poems in nine - teenth century English literature .

		The poems receiving the highest numbers of votes are now printed in a neat booklet entitled `` The Best Short Poems of the Nine - teenth Century '' -LRB-
Revell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		They are beaded by `` The Chambered Nautilus , '' and footed by
Wordsworth	PERSON	's '' Daffodils . ''

		It goes without saying that they are all good poems , and also that they are not the best .

		That is , they are the favorites of intelligent readers , not the masterpieces recognized by authoritative critics .

		Ten - nyson has four of the number ,
Wordsworth	PERSON	three , and fifteen other poets one or two each .

		The publishing and bookselling fraternity , and the book world generally , will learn with regret of the de - struction by fire of the large establishment of the
J. B. Lippincott	PERSON	Company of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, one of the oldest and best equipped houses in the country .

		Although the loss of stock was complete , most of the plates of the standard works published by the house were found to be uninjured , and the presses and binderies of the city were at once set at work in producing new editions , so that orders can shortly be filled as before .

		With praise - worthy enterprise the firm at once secured new quarters and began the construction of a new building , which , with new and complete machinery and equipment , may be expected to place the house in a more advantageous position than it before enjoyed . ''

		The International Monthly , '' further described as 41 a magazine of contemporary thought , '' is to be launched by the Messrs.
Macmillan	PERSON	on the first of next month .

		It is to be edited by Mr.
Frederick A. Richardson	PERSON	, with the assistance of an advisory board made up of twelve distinct committees , having in their special charge the twelve departments of history , philosophy , psychology , sociology , comparative religion , literature , fine art , biol - ogy , medicine , geology , physics , and industrial art .

		Each committee is supposed to include an American , an Englishman , a Frenchman , and a German .

		Thus the department of literature is under the direction of Pro- fessor
W. P. Trent	PERSON	, Dr.
Richard Garnett	PERSON	,
M. Gustave Lanson	PERSON	, and Professor
Alois Brandl	PERSON	.

		These names cer - tainly inspire confidence , and are fairly typical of the sort of scholarship enlisted for the entire enterprise .

		Not less than five essays will be included in each num - ber of the journal , and these essays will be given suf - ficient space to permit their respective subjects to be treated seriously , if not exhaustively .

		In fact , it looks as if we were now to have for the first time in this country a review in which writers may express them - selves at such length as to make it really worth their while .

		We understand that it is the plan of the man - agement to select such subjects as may be dealt with instructively from the standpoints of the four nations , and to assign each subject of this sort to an American , an English , a French , and a German writer for treat - ment .

		The plan is a praiseworthy one , and should re - sult in some valuable comparative studies .
