		TOPICS IN LEADING PERIODICALS ... 31 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 31 CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF THE I-NOVEL .

		A German novelist and critic ,
Spielhagen	PERSON	, has called the attention of students of the novel to certain characteristics that seem to distin - guish narratives related in the first person from those told in the third person .

		The novel of the first person he has called , with the facility of his language in the coining of tech - nical terms , der Ich - Roman , the I-novel ; and the phrase is apt enough , perhaps , to excuse an attempt to include it in English critical term - inology .

		Though Spielhagen applies the word especially to an autobiographical novel , many of his remarks have an application to the struc - ture of narrative of the first person that is generic .

		The autobiographical quality , indeed , must in any case be relative ; and it is my pur - pose to study on
Spielhagen	ORGANIZATION	's lines a few novels that are not autobiographical .

		Yet if an autobiographical novel is cast in the first person , its directness of form makes it seem to most readers more lifelike and con - vincing .

		It gains thereby an added degree of personal closeness .

		Directness , therefore , and a resulting capacity for intensity are the qualities first remarked as belonging to the I-structure .

		How inherent these are may be proved by the great difference in the nature of some of the novels that the I-form helps to vitalize .

		From
Stevenson	PERSON	's '' Treasure Island '' to
Kingsley	PERSON	's ''
Alton Locke	PERSON	'' and to
Bronte	PERSON	's ''
Jane Eyre	PERSON	'' is a far cry ; none of these is in any large sense autobiographical , yet they all possess an unusual degree of vividness .

		They are representatives of three distinct classes , the story of adventure , the tract-novel , and the novel of passion .

		Each of these kinds , if well written , is likely to be intense , but for different reasons .

		The story of adventure of the type of
Stevenson	PERSON	's is intense through the excitement aroused by following the incidents .

		The tract - novel , written with the express purpose of set - ting forth the author 's ideas on moral or public questions , is likely to be intense through the writer 's earnestness of feeling and purpose .

		And the novel of passion , if it really succeeds in delineating some great primary emotion , is thereby certain to be intense .

		Now this intensity in the nature of the ma -
12	DATE
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
July 1	DATE	, terial is at once aided by the first-person form of discourse .

		The form agrees with the spirit it clothes .

		The truth of this analysis receives some proof by the absence , in the three novels mentioned , of diversity of characterization and multiplicity of interests . ''

		Treasure Island '' shows little breadth of characterization , though it reveals some vivid figures ; and its interest is single . ''


Alton Locke	PERSON	'' has a gifted tailor for a hero , and is concerned with portraying him as a tailor and a workman .

		Conditions , rather than people , are pictured and characterized , and these conditions are strictly limited both in extent and time .

		Compared with ''
Marcella	PERSON	, '' for example , which is less distinctly a tract - novel , ''
Alton Locke	PERSON	'' has a much more con - fined range of interest and characterization . ''


Jane Eyre	PERSON	'' is remarkable for its narrow range , for its singleness of effect .

		Two per - sons , two only , stand out in high relief from a background offering little variety of scenery , personage , or incident .

		We pass far into the hearts of those two , and that suffices . ''

		The Vicar of
Wakefield	LOCATION	, '' also an I-novel and one not closely autobiographical , has again not much diversity of character , incident , or con - dition .

		This novel is the history of a group rather than of one ; but of strictly narrative material it contains little not directly connected with this immortal group .

		None of these novels attempts to give the life of a community , none of them possesses epic fulness ; none of them accomplishes an equally full , just , and lively delineation of several personages , such as is found in many third - person novels .

		They contrast markedly in this particular with '' Middlemarch , '' for example , with its complex plot , its skilful portrayal of diverse character , and its varied background ; or , again with
Meredith	PERSON	's `` Egoist , '' where , though a relatively small company of persons is studied , and the background is slight , we yet find subtle and elaborate analysis of one after another of the chief figures .

		To such work as this the I-form is not adapted .

		The reason for this is that the I-form com - pels a certain unity or singleness of structure because of the structural importance of the narrator .

		The whole story must , of course , pass through the mind of the I-narrator ; he must be present everywhere , and in a way ab - sorb everything into himself .

		Unity of material is indeed not required ; for this structural unity dependent on the narrator is so inherent that it can hold together a great diversity of mate - rial .

		This is why in a story of adventure of the picaresque type , in which there is little logical connection between incidents and slight study of character , there is nevertheless one kind of structural unity : the unity , namely , of a biography .

		But in such stories concen - tration or intensity of feeling is impossible . ''


Roderick Random	PERSON	, '' here used as representa - tive of this type , shows life from many points of view , and has a varied background .

		Yet everything is seen superficially , and is sub - jected to the demands of the hero in his role of adventurer .

		In fact , the I-novel of the single - narrator type can not , or at least does not , as the third-person form may , include both breadth and intensity .

		Dickens 's ''
Copperfield	PERSON	'' and '' Great Expectations '' -LRB- of the novels here studied -RRB- most nearly succeed in doing this .

		And yet the quality of these I-novels is not essentially different from that of
Dickens	PERSON	's other stories , and it is not the quality -LRB- it lacks , indeed , the element of intensity -RRB- of either '' The Egoist , '' ''
Jane Eyre	PERSON	, '' or '' Treasure Island . ''

		Looked at from this point of view ,
Dickens	PERSON	's I-novels are more akin to ''
Roderick Random	PERSON	. ''

		This structural importance of the narrator is certainly one of the most noteworthy charac - teristics of the I-novel .

		The narrator always remains the structural centre , even if he is by no means the most interesting personage .

		In a story like ''
Cranford	LOCATION	, '' where the narrator scarcely claims the reader 's attention , he yet remains the connecting link or the motive power of a whole group , furnishing so far as there is any the logic of their appearances and behavior .

		But if the I-form can partially unify diver - sity and reinforce intensity , it yet has also special off-setting difficulties .

		The problem of legitimacy , of rendering natural the narrator 's knowledge and ignorance , his presence and his absence , his acting and his not acting , is not easy of solution .

		The difficulty peculiar to the I-form lies in the fact that the narrator is a double personage .

		Logically , he of course rep - resents the author , yet he is also a figure in the story .

		As author he is bound if the novel is to have the higher artistic effects of which narrative is capable to prepare the reader for what is to come .

		Being the pivot on which the structure turns , he rather than the other personages must carry the chief bur - den of this preparation .

		Yet as one of the figures in the story , the narrator must himself not see what it is too early for him to see ; and even after he has the knowledge that would
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 13 naturally lead to action , he must not act before the proper time .

		He must be a transparent medium through which the reader may dimly behold the future , himself remaining passive , unresisting , and unperceiving ; nevertheless , he is supposed to be endowed with the usual de - gree of intelligence and activity .

		This is the crux of the I-form .

		How shall this double personality be maintained with lifelikeness ?

		How solve the problem that demands from the narrator enlightenment of the reader and at the same time blindness or inaction in himself ?

		The magnitude of the problem of legitimacy is apparent when a master like
Stevenson	PERSON	re - sorts to such a trick as that on which '' Treas - ure Island '' hinges , the boy-hero , with no malice prepense , climbing into ' a nearly empty apple-barrel and falling asleep ; to be oppor - tunely waked to hear the treachery of the ship 's crew .

		The hero 's knowledge of what occurs on the island aside from what happens to him - self , which is far more important is legiti - mated by making him an eaves-dropper .

		Indeed , eaves-dropping or accidental overhear - ing is a device used in nearly every one of the novels here studied .

		Accident is , of course , an easy mode of legitimation .

		It necessarily plays some part in any picture of life , but the reader dislikes the too frequent or the too opportune accident . ''


Roderick Random	PERSON	, '' for example , uses chance so abundantly and so unskilfully as fairly to arouse resentment .

		The problem of legitimacy here , as in other similar stories , chiefly concerns the sudden changes of fortune undergone by the hero ; and these are due , not to his character , but to a stroke of good or ill luck . ''

		The Vicar of Wake - field '' shows especially the difficulty of bring - ing the persons together ; a difficulty naturally greater after the narrator is in prison , where he is nevertheless to meet all the others .

		Nor is the problem well solved in ''
Jane Eyre	PERSON	. ''

		Here the preparation of the reader is directly and seriously at variance with the needed ignorance of the heroine .

		How can
Jane	PERSON	come so near the lunatic as she does , and witness so much of the results of frensy , without divining the truth ?

		Her ignorance is legitimated , but hardly adequately , by
Rochester	LOCATION	's preliminary order to withhold all knowledge of the crazy woman from the governess , and later by his personal care to silence any suspicions she has .

		Scrutiny of the plot reveals other improbabilities ; but of this novel the incidents and the plot , though single and strong in places , are swallowed up in the intensity with which the author presents the themes of love , separation , and reunion .

		To her the presenting means must have been a minor matter .

		The novels analyzed seem to show that the I-structure is especially effective in a story built upon adventure or upon some masterful passion or personality .

		In these cases the problem of legitimacy , while always obstinate , no doubt , is nevertheless capable of a somewhat satisfactory solution because of the dominance of the narrator-hero , or because of the limited range of interests necessary to suc - cess .

		Obviously the novels of Dickens do not belong wholly to either of these classes or to the type represented by ''
Roderick Random	PERSON	. ''

		They seem to be organized according to no rule or pattern , are often carelessly organized and extended beyond due bounds .

		With all their complexity one expects the problem of legiti - mation in ''
David Copperfield	PERSON	'' and '' Great Expectations '' to assume unusual proportions .

		But
Dickens	PERSON	is helped by the very looseness of his structure .

		Neither of these novels has a scenic plot-centre a scene that brings all the personages together in a confusion or a combi - nation of interests .

		The heroes are accordingly never obliged to meet many of the persons at once , and the connection of scene with scene is made largely by their own voluntary acts .

		Moreover , in the structure of the stories there are some ragged ends .

		If the legitimation , therefore , is not uncommonly difficult in these long and intricate I-novels , this is chiefly be - cause
Dickens	PERSON	evades it , as he does also in his third-person novels .

		One other difference in the structure of the two forms of narrative is noticeable .

		It con - sists in the treatment accorded author 's com - ment .

		Author 's comment is a term applied to what - ever departs from pure narrative by way either of generalization from individual instances , of direct address to the reader , or of expression of feeling not dramatized in some personage , but seen to be the author 's own .

		In the third - person novel such reflection or appeal is re - garded by some critics as not properly a part of the story .

		However apt it may be , or pleasant to the reader , from the standpoint of narrative structure it is declared to be an excrescence , because it is not objectified in the thoughts and acts of the personages but re - mains separate and abstract .

		In any piece of fiction , comment closely approaches logically the narrative of thoughts much used in modern novels as a means of character-analysis .

		Log - ically , this narrative of thoughts is in part the 14 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, author 's comment upon the character he is portraying ; but structurally it holds a different relation to the work from that of the comment defined above , because it is objectified and individualized , and is thus truly incorporated with the narrative .

		Now the peculiarity of the I-form is that it objectifies and incorporates all comment by making it the direct utterance of the I-narrator .

		Critics who object to com - ment in the third-person form must admit that in I-narrative it gains the structural right of entrance , because the narrator is present in his own story and has full liberty to relate either his deeds or his thoughts .

		In the I-novel , accordingly , the relation between narrative of thoughts and author 's comment in the strict sense is sometimes so close as to make the dif - ference almost indistinguishable .

		The differ - ence lies , however , so far as it may be perceived at all , in the fact of generalization .

		Author 's comment becomes objectified , indeed , to the extent that it is uttered by the I-narrator ; but yet it is only half dramatized , it may still serve the author 's philanthropic or homiletic purpose , it still stops the narrative of events ; it is gen - eralized , and thus it has the value of an essay or a sermon .

		If the comment , however , springs really from the thoughtful habit of mind in the author , the statements just made presup - pose some identity between the author and the hypothetical narrator .

		And this fact points to what seems to be actually the case , that in I-novels wherein there is but slight spiritual relationship to the author in stories he has told for the sake of spinning a yarn not much comment is recognizable as author 's reflection .


Stevenson	PERSON	's stories are an instance .

		But in all I-novels where there is close relationship be - tween the author and the narrator , comment may be expected and its legitimacy fully granted .

		Nevertheless , the structural incorporation thus of author 's comment is a two - edged weapon .

		Though greater freedom is thereby allowed the author to reflect on life , to discuss moral or public questions , than could be easily admitted in a third-person novel , yet this same freedom tempts him to pass beyond the bounds of liveliness or of naturalness .

		He is tempted , if he has at heart some great question , to make the I-narrator the mouthpiece of his anxieties and his plans to such an extent that the novel becomes a tract , a servant of the age without permanent artistic value .

		This is true of ''
Alton Locke	PERSON	. ''

		Or , the author is tempted to overlay the narrative with such an amount of observation and reflection , part of which may be inconsistent with the person uttering it , that the novel loses its dramatic interest without being recompensed by the logical fulness and consistency of a treatise .

		This is illustrated by
Besant	PERSON	's novel ''
Dorothy Wallis	PERSON	. ''

		The I-nar - rator becomes in such cases as these , so far as he is a fictitious personage , a victim of the author 's zeal for humanity , and is immolated on the altar of progress .

		Possibly few things furnish a better test of the character of a novelist 's gift than the fre - quency of his comment and the nature of the things he says . ''


Jane Eyre	PERSON	, '' though it has scattered addresses to the reader , is uncom - monly free from reflection as a thing apart from the body of the story .

		The nature of the work is almost purely narrative .

		Dickens 's I-novels show the same slightness of reflection as on the whole is usual in his works .

		His gift is not in the direction of thought .

		The same may be said of
Smollett	PERSON	.

		On the other hand ,
Kingsley	PERSON	's book , overloaded with com - ment and not ballasted by a dramatic plot , proves him a moralist and a preacher quite as readily as do his sermons or his fondness for quoting
Carlyle	PERSON	. ''

		The Vicar of
Wakefield	LOCATION	, '' perhaps the most truly genial of any of these books , is after all weighted with no small amount of eighteenth century sententiousness .

		One or two chapters are entirely filled with abstract essays , curiously legitimated by being delivered as sermons by the Vicar .

		A similar device is used by
Kingsley	PERSON	.

		To
Sterne	PERSON	, of course , one turns for examples par excellence of comment ; since , indeed , the comment in some sense vitalizes his work .

		But in this as in other things '' Tristram Shandy '' illustrates not the ordinary workings of the I-structure ; rather only some of its peculiarities exaggerated into fantastic oddity .

		Hence , after all , it may be said that though I-narrative doubtless in theory allows comment , none of the novels here an - alyzed , except the two mentioned , makes much undue use of the liberty ; and the remark sug - gests itself that even an I-novel is an uncertain vehicle for social or philosophical disquisition .

		Other characteristics and other forms of I-narrative must be studied before positive conclusions can be reached concerning its na - ture ; perhaps , however , enough has here been done to show that the I-form adapts itself with remarkable ease either to material intense and concentrated in feeling , or to material which , subordinating emotion , is flowing and compre - hensive in incident .

Asia	LOCATION	that once terra incognita to the north of the Hindu-Kush range poetically known as the Roof of the World is now ac - cessible in a number of good books written from different political view-points .

		The re - gion is a rather tempting one to the explorer and the sportsman ; but perhaps its chief in - terest just now lies in the fact that it marks the point where the jurisdictions of three Em - pires , the British , the Russian , and the Chi - nese , meet in rivalry although the
China	LOCATION	- man does not seem to count for much there as a competitor .

		The latest literary traveller in this debatable land of high plateau and towering peak is Mr.
Ralph P. Cobbold	PERSON	, who records his experiences and impressions , and gives vent to some very decided opinions , in a handsome volume of 350 odd pages entitled ''
Innermost Asia	LOCATION	. ''

		Mr.
Cobbold	PERSON	's book is ostensibly and essen - tially a story of travel and sport in the
Pamirs	LOCATION	; but , as a Briton of the strenuous type and an ex-officer in the army to boot , he does not let slip the opportunity to dilate vigorously on the political questions connected with the country he visited .

		It is due to Mr.
Cobbold	PERSON	to say that a portion of the country he saw has never before been viewed by an Englishman , and that his enforced detention by Russian officials at an outlying post gave him an exceptional op - portunity for studying Russian administrative methods in newly annexed territory .

		These methods are partly exemplified in the following incident : * INNERMOST ASIA : Travel and Sport in the

		One day I had an interesting opportunity of seeing how the Russian conquerors treat their subject races .

		I happened to be at the
Consulate	ORGANIZATION	when an Andijani merchant called on some business , and was promptly invited to enter .

		He was treated as an honored guest ; the Russian officers chatted with him on terms of inti - macy , and to watch him seated in the Consul 's private room as he partook of tea and fruit one would have supposed him to be a cherished friend .

		The following morning I observed the same merchant making a hur - ried exit through the
Consulate	ORGANIZATION	gates , his progress be - ing skilfully accelerated by the whips of the Cossacks .

		From inquiries I gathered that the merchant had done something of which the Consul-General did not approve , or had failed to do something which
Petrovsky	PERSON	wished him to do . ''

		Nor do the Russian proconsuls , as it seems , hesitate to resort to extreme measures of com - pulsion with Chinese officials , even where the latter are , with the Russians , in joint control of the district .

		For instance , at
Kashgar	LOCATION	, the resident mandarin , or Taotai , proving stubborn on some small point of disagreement , it was arranged to lure him into the
Consulate	ORGANIZATION	under the pretence of treating him to a Russian vapor bath .

		A treat of a very different order , how - ever , was in store for the learned Confucian and representative of the
Dragon Throne	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was arranged that while the great man was en - joying his ablutions he was to be seized by four stout Cossacks and soundly whipped until his mind was open to a rational , or Russian , view of the point in dispute .

		Thus , as
Prince Ukhtomsky	ORGANIZATION	beautifully says , is the advance of
Holy Russia	LOCATION	in the Orient inspired by her motto , '' Power lies not in strength , but in love . ''

		It was on
September 13 , 1897	DATE	, that Mr.
Cobbold	PERSON	set out from
Srinagar	LOCATION	, by the military road through
Gilgit	LOCATION	and Hunza , on his long - planned visit to the Pamirs .

		After an inter - esting and adventurous two-months ' journey he reached
Kashgar	LOCATION	, where a rather protracted stay furnished him material for a pleasant chapter .

		Vierny , nearly five hundred miles distant , was the next considerable halting - point , and here the author enjoyed a tiger - hunt .

		We say enjoyed , although at one time the tables were very near being turned on Mr.
Cobbold	PERSON	, the reader being wrought up to a pleasing pitch of uncertainty as to whether in the end it was going to be the gentleman or the tiger .

		From Vierny Mr.
Cobbold	PERSON	returned to
Kashgar	LOCATION	, where he obtained a permit to visit the Russian Pamirs .

		This privilege led to an arduous journey and some trying adven - tures , as well as to an object-lesson in the methods of Russian officials , who detained Mr.
Cobbold	PERSON	for some time as a prisoner on parole , in spite of his permit and his sacrosanct quality 16 THE DIAL , -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, as a British subject .

		Freed from the clutches of his polite and hospitable but inexorable captors -LRB- who seem to have regarded him as a possible spy -RRB- , Mr.
Cobbold	PERSON	resumed his jour - ney in no sentimental mood , and on
July 7	DATE	crossed the Chinese frontier , of which he says : '' I confess that at this part of my journey I felt par - ticularly radiant .

		I had realized my ambition to visit the mighty Oxus in that part of its course which is quite unknown to Englishmen .

		I had crossed the dis - trict of
Roshan	LOCATION	, and visited the unknown region of Shighnan , which had been closed to Europeans ever since they had been under Muscovite dominion .

		I had crossed the
Panja	LOCATION	and visited the outermost stronghold of Afghan power at
Kala Bar Fanja	ORGANIZATION	, and I had seen the inside of the two most outlying Russian strongholds in innermost
Asia	LOCATION	, and I realized that the hardships I had met with had not been endured in vain . ''

		Mr.
Cobbold	PERSON	's book will be found both en - tertaining and instructive , and must , we think , take rank as a standard work of reference on the subject .

		Those who scout its political views must admit the value of its descriptions .

		It is handsomely illustrated and well provided with maps .

		Mr.
John Ward	PERSON	's charmingly illustrated volume of travel-sketches from
Egypt	LOCATION	, entitled `` Pyramids and Progress , '' seems almost an ideal book for the use of tourists looking
Nile	ORGANIZATION	- wards who wish to make the most of the jour - ney in the way of both pleasure and profit .

		As Professor
Sayce	PERSON	observes , in his thoughtful Introduction , the traveller who would learn all that a voyage up the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	can teach him must have the seeing eye and the hearing ear , and possess , moreover , the understanding mind ; and it is for such that Mr.
Ward	PERSON	's book is written .

		Mr.
Ward	PERSON	has not written as an an - tiquarian merely .

		In his descriptions , infor - mation as to the vestiges of ancient Egyptian civilizations is judiciously mingled with infor - mation as to the
Egypt	LOCATION	of to-day , the land of nascent progress in which
Lord Cromer	PERSON	and his staff of administrators and engineers are working so many wonders .

		The great works of irrigation now in progress , the enormous barrages and reservoirs destined to regulate the flow , check the waste , and double the area of fertilization of the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	, are fully described .

		Mr.
Ward	PERSON	's scholarly and concise book is a model one of its kind , and may be cordially recommended to the intelligent tourist , and to the reader in quest of general information .

		Reading Mr.
Charles W. Wood	PERSON	's chatty and enthusiastic account of his tour '' In the Valley of the Rhone '' is nearly as good as making the trip one 's self rather better , in - deed , in some regards and for not a few tem - peraments .

		As
Schopenhauer	PERSON	says , the ex - pression '' to enjoy one 's self at
Paris	LOCATION	'' instead of '' to enjoy
Paris	LOCATION	'' is a profoundly accurate one .

		At all events , Mr.
Wood	PERSON	clearly has the capacity for having an immensely good time , as every page of his book attests .

		For an F.R.G.S. , he seems a rather sentimental trav - eller , and has not , we think , wholly neglected the immortal model of the historian of Father
Lorenzo	PERSON	and the caged starling .

		But the sug - gestion of a model is slight and unobtrusive ; and of good set description and nuggets of ac - tual information in the guide-book way there is no lack .

		Mr.
Wood	PERSON	's starting-point was Mon - treux , in the upper , or Swiss , Rhone valley ; and his itinerary for this region embraced the best towns of the cantons of
Vaud	LOCATION	and
Valais Territet	LOCATION	,
Caux	LOCATION	,
Chillon	LOCATION	,
Sion	LOCATION	,
St. Maurice	ORGANIZATION	,
Martigny	LOCATION	,
Orsieres	LOCATION	,
Liddes	LOCATION	,
Geneva	LOCATION	.

		The St.
Bernard Hospice	PERSON	was visited , of course .

		The lower or French valley was `` done '' in leisurely fashion .

		From
Lyons	PERSON	a delightful excursion by train and diligence was made to the Au - vergne district .

		Aries was made the rallying - point for a series of delightful jaunts , and Mr.
Wood	PERSON	does not omit the customary tribute to the fair Arlesiennes . ''

		Fair women ?

		They are indeed fair women .

		We had long heard of the charm of the Arldsiennes .

		but our imagination fell short of the truth .

		We never an - ticipated such a galaxy of beauty beauty of a noble and splendid type .

		They are said to have retained the old Roman type of the earlier centuries , and apparently it is so .

		In no other way can one explain the phenom - enon for it is nothing less than a wonder . ''

		A trip to Aries is evidently well worth while .

		Les Baux ,
Mont Major	PERSON	,
St. Remy	ORGANIZATION	, La Ca - margue ,
St. Gilles	LOCATION	, Aignes-Mortes ,
Avignon	LOCATION	,
Villeneuve	LOCATION	,
St. Peray	LOCATION	,
Vienne	LOCATION	, were visited and explored , with pleasant results .

		In short , Mr.
Wood	PERSON	's book is an exceptionally lively and readable one , with a due savor of litera - ture and scholarship , and an element of decided interest and charm in the eighty-eight artistic drawings that enrich it .

		In Mr.
W. Anderson Smith	PERSON	's '' Temperate
Chile	LOCATION	'' will be found a rather severely critical yet friendly and impartial account of that en - ergetic and combative little state , its people , politics , resources , customs , and geographical features .

		The book is soberly written , and with a view to the instruction rather than en - tertainment of the reader , being filled with solid information and carefully drawn conclu - sions .

		Mr.
Smith	PERSON	evidently believes in the
1900	DATE	.

		J THE DIAL future prosperity and political stability of
Chile	LOCATION	, though things are at present in a rather raw and inchoate condition .

		Intemperance is common , and homicides are shockingly frequent . ''

		When a large bottle of very strong and fiery alco - holic spirit can be bought for about sixpence , and living is otherwise cheap , the natural consequence is a large consumption ... Scarcely a day passes in
Santiago	LOCATION	without two or three murders ; and it is commonly as - serted and believed that 1,500 to 1,800 men are annu - ally victims of violence between
Valparaiso	ORGANIZATION	and
San	LOCATION	- tiago . ''


Chile	LOCATION	is as yet but nominally republican , many of the old semi-aristocratic or oligarchic au - thorities and abuses having , in point of fact , survived the Revolution , and a more or less vicious and ignorant priesthood still blights the minds and morals of the people . ''

		In place of a fresh new republican tree we have a weak republican graft on the old oligarchy , that re - mains still largely in evidence .

		The wealth seized from
Peru	LOCATION	has aggravated rather than relieved the situation .

		It has increased the number of parasites removed from the possible workers in the more beneficial paths of in - dustry and commerce .

		Like a hive of bees that has robbed its neighbor ,
Chile	LOCATION	is in danger of becoming a nation of professional thieves , rather than steady devel - opers of its undoubtedly valuable resources .

		... A restraining and modifying influence is , however , ap - parent in all the growing centres of population .

		The educated and struggling middle class is increasing at a far greater ratio than the lower , with which insanitary surroundings and ways of life , aided by the knife and aguardiente , wage continual and effective war .

		The public press is outspoken and increasingly liberal , edu - cation advancing on sound lines , and every act of gov - ernment criticized keenly and discussed with heat in every bar and cafe . ''

		Those in need of solid information as to
Chile	LOCATION	's present condition and her outlook should not neglect Mr.
Smith	PERSON	's book .

		It has an index and a good map .

		On
June 16 , 1897	DATE	, the steamer '' Excelsior , '' of the
Alaska Commercial Company	ORGANIZATION	, steamed to her dock near the foot of Market Street ,
San Francisco	LOCATION	; and that night the wires flashed over the country the news that a part of her cargo was
$ 750,000	MONEY	in gold-dust , an earnest of what was going to prove the richest '' strike '' in all American mining history .

		On
June 17	DATE	, another boat , the ''
Portland	LOCATION	, '' reached
Seattle	LOCATION	, bringing 8800,000 more of what newspaper economists and stump orators call the '' yellow metal '' ; and the Coast was presently '' gold crazy '' once more .

		The rush to the Klondike began .

		On the
28th of July Messrs. Harper & Brothers of New York	ORGANIZATION	commissioned a corre - spondent to go to
Dawson	PERSON	to procure news and pictures of the gold-fields .

		Mr.
Tappan Adney	PERSON	was the one chosen for the work ; and on
July 30	DATE	he started for the West , specially equipped with one year 's photographic outfit .

		Arrived at the scene of operations , Mr.
Adney	PERSON	plunged manfully into the thick of the fray , doing at the Klondike as the
Klondikers	PERSON	did , and study - ing in all its phases the life at the new
Eldo	PERSON	- rado .

		The literary and pictorial result of his expedition is embodied in a comely volume of nearly five hundred pages , entitled `` The Klon - dike Stampede . ''

		It is a racy and graphic book , full of hints and counsels for the tyro , in which one may view through the eyes of a keen observer the Klondike drama in its pecu - liar phases .

		Social life , we learn , adorned and softened by the presence of the fair sex , was not lacking at
Dawson	PERSON	.

		Indeed , there was a good deal of it .

		It centred at a dance-hall known as ''
Pete	PERSON	's , '' the fashionable
Almack	PERSON	's of the place .

		Its presiding genius , after `` Pete '' himself , was the `` caller-off , '' a strenu - ous and voluble young man whose function it was to keep the fun going , and , incidentally , the whiskey flowing .

		Bashful '' gents '' with the wall-flower habit were urged into action , and economical `` gents '' were shamed into bursts of prodigality .

		When the music struck up , the exhorter began : '' ' Come on boys you can all waltz let 's have a nice , long , juicy waltz ; ' and then , when three or four couples had taken the floor ... the fun began ... Hardly had the dancers stopped before the caller-off , upon whose skill in keeping the dances going depended the profits of the house , began again in his loud voice , coaxing , imploring ' Come on boys , ' or , < Grab a lady , boys , V have a nice quadrille . '

		And so it went on all night , one hundred and twenty-five dances being not unusual before daylight appeared through the frosted panes . ''

		`` Grabbing '' a lady involved treating her at the bar after the dance was over ; and so , with whiskey at a dollar a drink and champagne at forty dollars a bottle , the `` pokes , '' or gold - sacks , of the miners grew lean rapidly , while the coffers of `` Pete '' waxed fat .

		Mr.
Adney	PERSON	's vivacious book gives a satisfactory view of the Klondike movement of 1897-98 , and the pic - tures are as good as the text .

		Miss
Margaret W. Morley	PERSON	's fresh and ex - hilarating account of her leisurely
summer	DATE	jaunt in
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	and
Cape Breton Island	LOCATION	deserves a more graceful title than `` Down North and Up Along . ''

		Miss
Morley	PERSON	visited in turn
Digby	LOCATION	, Grand Pre ,
Blomidon	LOCATION	, Part - ridge
Island	LOCATION	,
Halifax	LOCATION	,
Baddeck	LOCATION	,
Englishtown	LOCATION	,
Igonish	LOCATION	, etc. , and she paints what she saw in a style that is refreshingly straightforward and unaffected .

		Miss
Morley	PERSON	has the sense of 18 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, humor , as the following picture of ''
Tommy Atkins	PERSON	, '' as seen at
Halifax	LOCATION	, may attest : '' Their presence is decorative , but individually these soldiers are not very impressive .

		Many of them are certainly round-shouldered ; and with their bright red coats and tiny round caps perched on an angle of the head and held in place by straps under the chin , they look so irresistibly like the long-tailed gentleman who sits on the hand-organ and doffs his cap for pennies , that it is difficult to contemplate them with the respect due to their glorious calling . ''

		So much for the units of the historic '' thin red line . ''

		Miss
Morley	PERSON	's book is a capital one with which to while away the sultry hours of a
summer	DATE	holiday .

		Miss
E. M. Merrick	PERSON	is a
London	LOCATION	artist , and portraits are her specialty ; but she has made some creditable excursions into the field of genre painting , in the illustrative or narrative English style .

		While still a student at the
Koyal Academy	ORGANIZATION	,
Miss Merrick	PERSON	made a trip to
Egypt	LOCATION	; and there , though mainly on pleasure bent , she found time to secure and begin sev - eral commissions , notably portraits of the Khedivia and of Mr.
H. M. Stanley	PERSON	.

		These successes turned Miss
Merrick	ORGANIZATION	's thoughts to the Orient as a promising field of operations ; and a professional foray into
India	LOCATION	followed .

		The memories of these expeditions are now printed in a pretty little volume entitled `` With a Palette in
Eastern Palaces	LOCATION	, '' which has a cer - tain special descriptive value owing to the fact that its author , in her capacity of portrait - painter , was often permitted to penetrate into places that are closed to most tourists in - deed , to all masculine visitors whomsoever .

		The book presents many lively pictures of East Indian society and manners , native and exotic ; and it is written with true feminine vivacity .

		It contains some interesting reproductions of por - traits painted in the East by the author ; but quite the most attractive thing in it is the frontispiece portrait of Miss Merrick herself .

		While in
Egypt	LOCATION	,
Miss Merrick	LOCATION	met some American tourists . ''

		I remember one remarking to me when I was feel - ing rather seedy at
Assouan	LOCATION	, ' Wai , you do look like a worm .

		Guess
Egypt	LOCATION	do n't suit you .

		You 'll go home in a box likely . '

		American expressions sound very funny to our ears . ''

		We should think so .

		American readers will regret that Miss Merrick fails to say what section of this country the expressions quoted are native to . ''

		Ivory Apes and Peacocks '' is the suffi - ciently bizarre title of a sheaf of East Indian travel-pictures by that pleasantly fantastical essayist and virtuoso of irridescent phrases , '' Israfel . ''

		To the travel-pictures are added a half-dozen rhapsodic little papers on themes musical and literary '' The Musical Critic , '' '' Rudyard Kipling , '' '' Music and Literature , '' etc. .

		Other titles are , '' Peninsular and
Ori	PERSON	- ental , '' ''
Bombay	LOCATION	, '' ''
Agra	LOCATION	, '' The Taj Ma - hal , '' `` Delhi , '' ``
Benares	LOCATION	, '' ``
Calcutta	LOCATION	, '' and so on . ''

		Israfel '' is essentially a stylist , an executant of brilliant verbal fantasias ; and we are not to look to him for statistics , or for a British tax-payer 's views on the Indian budget .

		He has a curious trick of wilful bathos , of checking a flight of parti-colored words with a homely and even a relatively vulgar allusion .

		A rhapsody on the
Taj Mahal	ORGANIZATION	is thus cut short by the memory of the grateful effect of a glass of whiskey on a chilly night : `` I went to see the Taj by moonlight -LRB- oh !

		the trite - ness of the phrase ! -RRB-

		a full moon .

		The night was such a one as you might spend ' with
Saadi	PERSON	in the gar - den , ' breathless and tropical , the flower scents rose as incense straight to Heaven , the gleaming tanks were sheets of shadowy silver , and musical with frogs .

		The Taj shone , peerless as a swan on a lake , in the sky of dusky amethyst , a palace of pearl pierced by soft , un - fathomable glooms .

		... I can not express the Un - reality , the Ideality , of the
Taj that night	TIME	.

		Standing but a few paces from its ghostly loveliness , I felt that it was a vision , impalpable , unattainable ; I thought of
Epipsychidion	LOCATION	, ' I thought of
Heine	LOCATION	's Ewig verlor ` nes LiebJ I thought of the whiskey-peg I should have when I got home for the night was a cold one . ''

		Asked to describe the
Taj Mahal	ORGANIZATION	, the author 's uncle said that it was '' a very nice place . ''

		Perhaps he would have reserved his enthusi - asm for the whiskey-peg .

		Readers who care for '' Israfel '' at all will like this his latest volume very much .

		We have read with much relish the seven - teen papers contained in Mr.
Richard Le Gal	PERSON	- lienne 's pretty volume entitled '' Travels in
England	LOCATION	, '' and shall certainly re-read some of them the specially pleasant ones on Win - terslow and
Stratford	LOCATION	, for example .

		Mr.
Le Gallienne	PERSON	went to Winterslow as to the one time home or lair , one may say of
Hazlitt	PERSON	; and he went to
Stratford	LOCATION	to see
Madame Bernhardt	PERSON	play `` Hamlet . ''

		These facts mark the drift and tenor of the two papers .

		Other places visited were
Selborne	LOCATION	,
Winchester	ORGANIZATION	,
Sarum	LOCATION	, Stonehenge ,
Avebury	PERSON	,
Lechlade	LOCATION	,
Kelmscott	LOCATION	,
Cirencester	LOCATION	, the
Cotswold 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		Let us add that the season was
summer	DATE	, and Mr.
Le Gallienne	PERSON	travelled a-wheel .

		Mr.
Herbert Railton	PERSON	's half - dozen dainty drawings harmonize nicely with the general character of this sprightly and pretty book .

		THE DIAL 19 THINGS OUT OF DOORS .

		* '' By the time
July	DATE	is well started , '' observes the gentle author of '' Friends Worth Know - ing , '' in his newer work , '' Nature 's Calendar , '' '' the rains have ceased , the woods are deep in the shadow of completed leafage and growing twigs , the soil is dry and is throwing out an increasing crop of curious agarics , and walking in the dusty roads or open uplands is unpleas - ant .

		Naturally enough , then , we turn in our rambles towards the watercourses and seek to read the ' books in the running brooks . ' ''

		Mr.
Ingersoll	PERSON	does not say , as he could have said , that the opening of
July	DATE	is the very crown and summit of the year ; nor could he have known that this year of grace ,
1900	DATE	, finds it a most exceptional time for seeing the outdoor world at its very best , abundant and early rains and moderate temperatures having given promise of a
July	DATE	that does not need to have its face washed for the dust upon it .

		It is truly a time and a season in which to observe the real beauties of this earth of ours , so far removed from the political turmoil in which that country is about to plunge .

		Nor should we , unless we know them thoroughly , neglect the lessons that are to be gained from so charming an assortment of books as have been provided for
summer	DATE	instruction and en - tertainment . ''

		Nature 's Calendar '' is a book for the year , containing on its broad pages '' a slender rivulet of text '' of much charm and pertinency , while beside and under it is a space of white marked for every day of the year , whereon notes may be made to supplement the observations of the author .

		But it is a calen - dar in another sense as well , for at the end of each of the months is set forth such a summary of the habits of live things , birds , reptiles , fishes , and insects , that the least observant can load himself with hints to make obvious and familiar at least a part of a world before invis - * NATURE 'S CALENDAR .

		By way of final grace to a book in the best of taste in all its essentials , twelve repro - ductions of as many photographs by Mr.
Clar	PERSON	- ence
Lown	PERSON	afford typical views of fields , forests , and rivers .

		Beautifully printed on paper which leaves one vexed that glazed surfaces have ever been tolerated , with nearly a hundred illustrations by Mr.
Oliver Kemp	PERSON	to interpret the thought in another medium , Dr.
Charles C. Abbott	PERSON	's '' In Nature 's Realm '' is a book to be treas - ured .

		Serenely philosophical , keenly observant , intellectually suggestive , the placid marshalling of the less obvious facts of nature , with their gentle spiritual interpretation from Dr. Ab - bott 's pen to make us all human together , is a real triumph of literature .

		He discusses , to take one example from scores , '' My Point of View , '' and his breadth is made ours if we read him aright when he says : '' I am what I am to nature , not what another , from his point of view , judges I should be .

		I am a part of nature and nature is a part of me .

		Tear us apart , and nature is robbed and I am ruined .

		Hence the futility of attempting radical changes ; for nations and coun - tries and climates have their peculiar points of view , and the Christianized pagan is still but a pagan
Chris	PERSON	- tianized .

		His idol may be a fraud , but it will never cease to be his idol .

		The outward sign of respect may be withheld , but the inward feeling of regard can never die .

		Who has seen the world with another 's eyes ?

		There is a cuttle-fish that can blacken the waters about it until the animal disappears , but the water is water still , and the animal is only hidden , not changed nor annihilated .

		The oak does not ask the elm to change its leaves , nor roses red taunt the violets because they are blue , why then seek to change my point of view and blur the landscape that to me is beautiful and so a joy forever ?

		The intensity of a personality that dwarfs others is more likely to prove a curse than a blessing .

		My limited individuality has its place and is not benefitted by shifting it from its bearings .

		Nature is a better director than man in this regard . ''

		There is much more of this delightful and hu - mane philanthropy , which contrasts so abruptly with the turmoil and warfare of the world due chiefly , it may be remarked , to the fact that we are not satisfied with burghers as burghers , Filipinos as Filipinos , or Mongols as Mongols , but are madly seeking to make them British , or American , or Caucasian , as the case may be .

		When the world has learned , like Dr.
Abbott	PERSON	, that a man 's point of view is his own , and that he is accountable for it to God alone , we shall all of us be in a fair way of being civilized , instead of merely thinking our - selves so .

		Mrs.
William Starr Dana	PERSON	's '' How to Know the Wild Flowers '' can hardly need extended 20 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, notice at this time , since the new edition an - nounces itself the fifty-sixth thousand .

		It dif - fers from its predecessors by the inclusion of forty-eight colored plates after the water-color sketches by Miss
Elsie Louise Shaw	PERSON	, uncolored pictures of the same flowers contained in for - mer editions being omitted here , and almost as many new ones being added from the faithful flower portraits of Miss
Marion Satterlee	PERSON	.

		The text stands as it did
seven years ago	DATE	, and the book in its present form leaves little to be de - sired .

		Miss
Alice Lounsberry	PERSON	's '' Guide to the Trees '' and Mrs.
Harriet L. Keeler	PERSON	's '' Our Native Trees '' differ chiefly in the personal equation of the two writers .

		Both give , with all the fulness desirable , the means whereby component members of American forests can be distinguished one from another , and their names ascertained with the least amount of trouble .

		In addition to this groundwork , which includes a complete description of the tree in all its details , bark , leaves , flowers , and fruit ,
Miss Lounsberry	PERSON	's book contains a great number of colored and black-and-white pictures and diagrams made by Mrs.
Ellis Rowan	PERSON	, and a brief introduction by Dr.
N. L. Britton	PERSON	.

		Mrs.
Keeler	PERSON	's work is illustrated by reproductions of photographs direct from na - ture , most of them of leaves and fruit , but with many drawings of details .

		It is a work which is less formal than the other , and with more of the literary quality .

		Quite as instructive , it sets forth the technicalities in popular language , while the photographs of leaves serve a better purpose in the process of identification .

		Either of the books is a desirable addition to the library .

		Mr.
Charles A. Keeler	PERSON	is already well known for his delightful writings after the manner of a
Californian Thoreau	PERSON	, and `` Bird Notes Afield '' will enhance his reputation both as a man of letters and of science .

		He deals with the birds of the
Pacific	LOCATION	coast more particularly , and his statement of the differences and re - semblances of these with the feathered folk of regions nearer the rising sun makes very de - lightful reading .

		Many of his studies have been made in the vicinity of
Berkeley	LOCATION	, for which the pleasant book of Miss
Eva V. Car	PERSON	- lin , published more than a year ago , serves as an introduction .

		He tells of the domestic life of the hummingbird , as follows : `` If you have the good fortune to have discovered an unfinished nest , you may observe the mother bird 's methods of work .

		She settles upon it and rounds it with her breast .

		Seemingly with difficulty the head is raised and the long , slender beak arranges here and there a bit of lichen , bark , or cobweb in its proper place on the outside .

		Thus she works until the compact little structure of softest thistledown , covered on the outside with small fragments of moss , lichen , bark , and similar materials , is ready to receive the invariable two white eggs .

		In due course of time the most helpless young imaginable are hatched , to be tended with unremitting care .

		They soon grow so large that their diminutive home can scarcely contain them until , at last , from the sheer physical necessity of overcrowded quarters , they are forced to essay a flight .

		Wonderful , indeed , is the domestic life of these smallest of birds , in whose minute frame is compacted so much of intelligence and passion so much that we fondly claim as human . ''

		In abrupt contrast with this may be taken the paper on `` Patrolling the Beach , '' in which nature in her most ferocious aspect , after a storm at sea , is followed in her work of devas - tation .

		The book , which is most alluringly designed , concludes with a key whereby the various birds of
California	LOCATION	may be differenti - ated and identified , the arrangement being such that no scientific knowledge is required for its use . ''

		Bird Homes , '' by Mr.
Radclyffe Dugmore	PERSON	, is such a book as every lover of birds must welcome , since it really admits the reader into the privacy of their family life .

		It is , more - over , an eloquent plea for acquaintance with our tiny neighbors as the best means of pre - serving them from the cruelties which make us ashamed of the name of human .

		One or two of the instances Mr.
Dugmore	PERSON	cites are quite too harrowing for repetition here .

		But such a paragraph as this is worth taking to heart : '' I think any woman who had seen a mother-thrush on the nest , with her anxious , wild little eyes looking out in fear of the intruder , could never again wear a stuffed bird as a hat ornament , to be used for a short month or two and then thrown away .

		For herein lies , perhaps , the chief cause of the partial extermination of our birds , both those that are sombre in color -LRB- for they can be dyed to any desired shade -RRB- and those that are by nature of brilliant hues .

		And who gains by this cruel sacrifice to a heartless fashion save the dealers ? ''

		A similar warning is addressed to the boy who begins an egg collection .

		Instructions are given which will enable the eggs to be taken without inflicting the birds with calamity , but a still stronger argument is made for observing the conduct of the young when hatched .

		It is to descriptions of this sort , admirably illus - trated by instantaneous photographs in repro - duction of the birds , old and young , in various stages of home building and family rearing , that the book is chiefly devoted ; and no better argument for the use of a camera instead of a
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 21 gun could be desired than these very pictures .

		Emerson 's lines are his text : '' Have you numbered all the birds of the wood , Without a gun ?

		Have you loved the wild rose And left it on its stalk ?

		be my friend , and teach me to be thine . ''

		Not only does the book abound in photographic reproductions , many of them in color , but there are several plates of eggs which will give the reader most of the advantages of a collection without the possibility of inflicting misery upon the small friends whom self-interest no less than humanity urges us to protect .

		Mr.
Dugmore	PERSON	is to be congratulated on the execution of his gentle and pious task .

		Of even greater interest than the book just noticed is Mr.
F. M. Chapman	PERSON	's pleasant narrative of '' Bird Studies with a Camera . ''

		Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	is the first American to discern the advantages which the exceedingly clever book of the Messrs.
Kearton	PERSON	, '' Wild Life at Home , '' held out to those happy folk who are amateurs in both photography and ornithology .

		Though his book is not so ambitious as his disciple 's , it covers more ground , and ground of another sort , without being quite so detailed .

		The two works , taken together , will form a course both elementary and advanced in the pleasant application of the two sciences of which it treats .

		Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	has been along the
Atlantic	LOCATION	coast and to the islands in the
St. Lawrence	LOCATION	in search of subjects , and he dis - courses on pelicans and plovers with the ease which Mr.
Dugmore	PERSON	bestows on bobolinks and blackbirds .

		Nests and eggs play their part with both , and so do the facts about lenses and hyposulphites ; Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	being more spe - cific in respect to the latter .

		So ends a charming task , most amiably suited to the crowning season of the year .

		Insects and flowers , butterflies and roses , birds and trees , fields and rivers , these are surely among the loveliest things on earth .

		WALLACE RICE .

		WE have already noticed the first six volumes of the '' Library of English Classics '' published by the Mac - millan
Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Three additional volumes of this series con - tain
Boswell	PERSON	's `` Life of Johnson , '' reprinted from the edition prepared by Mr.
Mowbray Morris	PERSON	for the '' Globe '' series of the same publishers .

		Beyond two or three pages of bibliography , this edition has no special apparatus ; it is simply a reprint , in an altogether digni - fied and acceptable form , of the most interesting of all literary biographies .

		The very low price at which the volumes of this '' Library '' are offered to the public should find for them exceptional favor in the eyes of pur - chasers .

		RECEXT FICTION .

		* Those readers to whom '' The Choir Invisible '' came as a revelation of strength allied with tender - ness , of spiritual beauty made one with the beauty of the visible world , have been eagerly awaiting further work from the pen of Mr.
James Lane Allen	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Allen	PERSON	takes his time about writing , and two years have gone to the composition of his new book , '' The Reign of Law . ''

		We are thus as - sured in advance of his usual careful workmanship , and we open his new volume with the most pleas - urable anticipations .

		These anticipations are not doomed to disappointment , for the work , considered primarily as a piece of literature , proves to be sat - isfying in a high degree .

		Those who care less for the graces of style and for the exhibition of elevated emotions than they care for a story apart from these adjuncts , will perhaps suffer some slight disappoint - ment when they discover that '' The Reign of Law '' is little more than an account of the struggles of an untutored country lad to win his spiritual emanci - pation .

		He is presented as an extremely sympa - thetic figure , but the story of his life has few inci - dents save those which are connected with his endeavor to secure an education , and with his eager quest for the higher forms of truth .

		All sorts of obstacles confront him as his mind gropes toward the light , and his spiritual freedom is gained at a great price .

		Living in an atmosphere of sectarian - ism and narrow religious bigotry , he finds his way unaided to the high intellectual plane of the great modern thinkers who have so transformed our primitive conceptions of the relation between man and the universe .

		The dogmatic influences which would impede his growth to full intellectual stature are successfully resisted , and be works out in his * THE REIGN OF LAW .

		22 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, own experience that sublime conception of the reign of law which has been the chief philosophical achievement of our age , and which dwarfs all the theological counsels , darkened by words without knowledge , of the past .

		Those who can match in their own experience the intellectual struggles of this youth will understand the author 's purpose ; for those who can not bring to their reading as much as they take from it , '' The Reign of Law '' will be a sealed book .

		That it should become widely popular we do not deem probable ; its interest is too special for that , and its direct appeal is made to the audience that is never a large one in any age .

		The gospel of easy comfortable acceptance of what - ever ideas are held by those around us , the gospel which is content to exalt for worship the idols of our own particular tribe or forum is more wide - spread in its influence than the gospel of those rare and strenuous spirits to whom Mr.
Allen	PERSON	's hero be - longs .

		To such lives there always attaches the pathos of loneliness , of the sympathy that yearns for a response but does not find it , and this aspect of the struggle is presented with deep poignancy by Mr.
Allen	PERSON	.

		The scene of the story is laid in
Ken	PERSON	- tucky , in the sixties , and it is described as '' A Tale of the
Kentucky Hemp Fields	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		This must be men - tioned , because the processes connected with the cultivation of hemp play an important part in the narrative .

		The landscape is colored by the vivid green of the hemp , its fragrance fills the air , and the soul of the hero is strong as with the strength of its fibre .

		In fact , hemp plays the part of a Leitmotiv , if there be such a thing in fiction , throughout the book , and , if the symbolism of its use appears somewhat labored in the earlier chap - ters , the writer in the end compels us to accept it as an essential part of his artistic scheme .

		We fancy that we do not err in ascribing to Mr.
Allen	PERSON	himself that `` Song of the Hemp '' which is intro - duced near the end , and credited to `` A minor
Kentucky	LOCATION	writer . ''

		It is an exquisite piece of verse , and we must find room for one of the four stanzas . ''

		Oh , dim , dim
autumn	DATE	days of sobbing rain When on the fields the ripened hemp is spread And woods are brown .

		No land , no land like this for mortal pain When Love stands weeping by the sweet , sweet bed For Love cut down . ''

		Mr.
Allen	PERSON	is half a poet even in his prose , and the transition to and from these verses is accom - plished without a jar .

		It is by his poetic charm that he has won our hearts , by that , and by his in - tense realization of some of our deepest moods , of some of our most spiritual aspirations .

		It is difficult to say anything in praise of '' An Angel of Clay . ''

		Mr.
Partridge	PERSON	is an excellent sculptor , but a poor writer of fiction .

		He has no control whatever over his medium , and words re - fuse to do his artistic bidding .

		He has produced a series of the veriest lay figures in this novel ; all of them use the same stiff and unnatural forms of speech , and not one of them has a spark of vitality .

		He has a message of fine idealism to deliver a message that he has delivered successfully in marble and in bronze that he might deliver successfully in the form of the essay ; but his attempt to set it forth in a work of fiction is a hopeless failure .

		If the reader will forego the expectation of finding a story in this book , and be content to view it as a series of thoughtful disquisitions upon art and life , he will not , however , go wholly unrewarded .

		Mr.
Chambers	PERSON	has so unusual a gift for romantic fiction that it is a pity he does not take greater pains with his work .

		The two stories which he has recently published are in a way exasperating , be - cause , good as they are , they might have been very much better .

		The reckless fashion of slinging his materials together , and relying upon his vigor and poetic exuberance for an effect , seems to be grow - ing upon this brilliant writer .

		Such slapdash methods of composition as are exemplified in '' The Cambric Mask '' and '' The Conspirators '' betoken a sad neglect of the writer 's opportunities , and make the reader extremely impatient .

		Both the stories are interesting , as a matter of course Mr.
Chambers	PERSON	always contrives to be that but neither of them gives us the satisfaction that we get from reasonably finished work . ''

		The Cambric Mask '' is a story of rural
New York	LOCATION	, and derives its inter - est from the attempt of a gang of whitecaps to intimidate and drive away from the region a gen - tleman who has come thither for the innocent pur - pose of entomological research .

		His entomology is not the cause of offense , but the fact that the land which he occupies has suddenly acquired great commercial value , and the other fact that he takes a too obvious interest in the impossible village beauty who figures as the heroine .

		When aroused to a sense of the dangers that threaten him , the hero turns out to be anything but the peaceable naturalist for whom he is taken .

		Being an old West Pointer , his fighting instincts are aroused , his strategy proves equal to his courage , and he routs his enemies in the most approved melodramatic fashion .

		Incidentally , he wins the impossible hero - ine , after her drunken , and in another sense impos - sible , father has been conveniently disposed of , and the romance ends in the conventional way . ''

		The Conspirators '' takes us to a very different field of action .

		The scene is the Grand Duchy of
Luxembourg	LOCATION	, and the period some imagined future time when the German Emperor is upon the point of annexing the territory that seems to lie defense - less within his grasp .

		His plans are thwarted , partly by the unexpected vigor with which
Holland	ORGANIZATION	opposes the scheme , and partly by the fact that the
United States	LOCATION	, in its new character as a world power , takes a hand in the affair .

		The hero is an exaggerated young American , having a diplomatic appointment in the Duchy , and getting into all sorts of scrapes and entanglements .

		There are really two heroines , one of them being the fictitious and picquant countess whom the hero sets himself to win , the other being no less a personage than the
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL actual Queen of
Holland	LOCATION	, for the audacity of the writer goes so far as to make him invent a romantic attachment between the fair
Wilhelmina	PERSON	and a prince of the German Empire .

		The book gives us a really charming picture of
Luxembourg	LOCATION	, both the drowsy capital and its wild surroundings , and nature , as viewed by the poetic imagination of the writer , counts for no small part of the interest of the story .

		The extent to which women are of late taking possession of the field of historical fiction must seem somewhat alarming to writers of the sterner sex .

		That women should vie with them in the de - lineation of sentiment and passion seems natural enough , but that women should also seek to vie with them in tales of battle and adventure seems at first sight an unwarrantable intrusion upon the natural prerogative of man .

		But the fact must be faced that women are taking more and more to the work of historical romance , and that some of them , at least , are doing the work in a highly successful manner .

		It is a little late to be speaking about '' To Have and to Hold , '' Miss
Mary Johnston	PERSON	's second novel , for the work attracted widespread attention when its first chapters appeared serially a year ago , and the completed book has been in the hands of readers for a number of weeks .

		But the book is so exceptionally good , and its great popular success so well deserved , that in giving it a few words of belated praise we have no fear of being taken to task for recalling attention to a forgotten book .

		Like
Miss Johnston	PERSON	's `` Prisoners of Hope , '' the new romance is a tale of colonial
Virginia	LOCATION	, and interest is divided between the natural conditions of life in the colony and its relations with the mother country .

		Miss
Johnston	PERSON	has a pretty inven - tion and an even prettier style .

		Exciting adventures and hairbreadth escapes follow one another in be - wildering succession , and the attention is ever alert .

		Crafty Indians and picturesque villains share the interest of the story with hero and heroine .

		There is even a pirate crew , a shipwreck , and a desert island .

		Of hero and heroine we may say that both are of the type dear to romantic souls ; the one is strong , resourceful , and courageous , the other is alternately haughty and tender , and always ador - ably feminine .

		Over the whole romance there is a slight cast of melodrama , and there is dis - played a little less of originality than in the story which first attracted readers to Miss
Johnston	PERSON	.

		In both books her knowledge of Indian ways is re - markable , and her understanding of Indian charac - ter has a degree of subtlety which even surpasses what we find in
Cooper	LOCATION	.

		And in both books the reader will linger longest over the many lovely pages which describe the Virginian wilds , the hills , the rivers , and the solemn solitudes of the forest .

		In this aspect of her work ,
Miss Johnston	PERSON	is almost comparable with
Miss Murfree	PERSON	, but fails to attain to quite the spiritual elevation of that writer in her contemplation of nature .

		With
Miss Johnston	PERSON	, the natural surroundings are always accessories of the narrative ; with
Miss Murfree	PERSON	, on the other hand , they are invested with a life and meaning of their own . ''


Mary Paget	PERSON	, '' by
Miss Minna Caroline Smith	PERSON	, is a slight and amateurish romance of
Bermuda	LOCATION	in the days when Englishmen first settled in the Sum - mer Islands , and when the tales of returning mar - iners fired the imagination of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and became transmuted into the '' rich and strange '' poetry of '' The Tempest . ''

		Miss
Smith	PERSON	is auda - cious enough to introduce the poet himself into her story , the scene of which remains in
England	LOCATION	until we are half way through the book .

		Her romance is in no way forceful , but it is written in a pleasing manner , and it seems to be based upon a careful study of the pertinent historical materials .

		It is with modern rather than with colonial Vir - ginia that `` The Voice of the People , '' by Miss
Ellen Glasgow	PERSON	, is concerned .

		This is Miss Glas - gow 's third novel , and it is thus far distinctly her best .

		Beginning with a charming description of an old Virginian town , which has been left side - tracked in the march of modern civilization , and is none the less interesting for that , we are at once introduced to the hero , an unprepossessing child of humble parentage , who has the intellectual instinct , and who is determined to raise himself above the level of his surroundings .

		The book is essentially the story of this child 's career , as he painfully ac - quires an education , becomes a successful lawyer , enters politics , and is chosen Governor of the Com - monwealth .

		He illustrates that type of American manhood of which
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	is the great historical exemplar , and of which Mr.
Ford	PERSON	's
Peter Stirling	PERSON	is a striking example in fiction , the type of sturdy honesty and downright manliness which our country is still capable of illustrating from time to time , and without which our prospects would indeed be hope - less .

		There are numerous minor characters in this book , carefully studied and agreeably diversified , who add materially to the interest , but the figure of
Nicholas Burr	PERSON	rises predominant above them all , and it is with his personal fortunes that we have chiefly to do .

		In the end , the story rises to the height of tragedy , and the hero , now Governor of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, sacrifices his life in defending the honor of the
Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	.

		A negro has been guilty of a nameless crime , and a lynching party has been organized .

		The governor comes unexpectedly upon the scene of action , opposes the lawless fury of the mob , and , before he has been recognized , is mor - tally wounded by a shot .

		`` And he died for a damned brute , '' is the comment of a bystander when the sobered mob learns what it has done .

		But even in the most brutish of that mob there must have been some dim recognition , in the lesson thus sharply brought home to them , of the shame of their assault upon the majesty of law , and of the noble cause for which their victim had given his life .

		Shocking as was the murder , it was less shocking and less permanently demoralizing than the success of their lawless undertaking would have been .

		In 24 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, describing this scene , the author rises to the true dignity of the situation , and leaves a deep impres - sion upon the minds of her readers .

		We have to thank her for a strong book , and for a message of practical idealism which can not be weighed too seriously .

		An interesting subject and honest workmanship combined are sufficient to make a good book , if not exactly a strong one .

		This is what we are offered by Miss
Caroline Brown	PERSON	's '' Knights in Fustian , '' a story of
Indiana	LOCATION	in the time of the Civil War .

		The secret organization of the Knights of the
Golden Circle	ORGANIZATION	forms the theme of this very readable story , which is based upon a careful study of the ramifi - cations of their conspiracy , and of the thwarting of their plans by the firmness and vigilance of the great War Governor of the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		Although Gov - ernor
Morton	PERSON	does not figure largely in person , he is , in a sense , the real hero of this book , which is essen - tially a tribute to his masterful management of the difficulty occasioned by the treasonable conspiracy in question .

		The writer truthfully says that '' we of a later generation can hardly credit the extent of the organization , and the heinousness of its aims , which included crime and the disruption of the
Union	LOCATION	. ''

		As a description of this interesting epi - sode in the history of the war the book is distinctly successful , and to the interest of this theme private interests are subordinated , although the story itself is not without a certain amount of action and of skilful characterization .

		Readers of '' The New Antigone '' and '' The Two Standards , '' having discovered that a Catholic priest may be as good a novelist as anybody else , will turn to ''
Arden Massiter	PERSON	, '' Dr.
Barry	PERSON	's third work of fiction , with something like enthusiastic anticipation .

		Nor will they be disappointed , for the new novel is the best of the three , one of the best novels , in fact , that have appeared for many a day .

		It is not such a novel of tendency as its pre - decessors were ; it is rather a brilliant picture of life in modern
Italy	LOCATION	, dramatic in manner rather than reflective , straightforward rather than discursive , and intensely interesting from first to last .

		The variety of its interest is such as to appeal to many tastes .

		Those who ask for nothing more than a story will find one of the most thrilling sort , a story of subterranean
Italy	LOCATION	, with its brigands , anarchists , and
Camorristi	PERSON	, a story of adventure and intrigue , a story of conspiracies and abductions and romantic passions .

		Those who ask more of a book than this will find their account likewise .

		They will find vivid and artistic delineations of character , im - pressive dramatic situations , that sense of the his - torical past which is a product of the ripest culture , and that insight into contemporaneous conditions which betokens close and intelligent observation .

		And all these things find expression in a style so admirable , so distinctly the writer 's own , so terse and direct when occasion requires , so measured and poetical when opportunity permits , that interest in the mere story is everywhere accompanied by the feeling that the book is much more than a story , that it belongs to a high and rare order of litera - ture .

		Miss
M. Imlay Taylor	PERSON	is the author of a growing series of historical novels in which , whether she takes for her subject imperial
Russia	LOCATION	or revolution - ary
America	LOCATION	, the
England	LOCATION	of
Thomas Cromwell	PERSON	or the
France	LOCATION	of
Cardinal Richelieu	PERSON	, she succeeds in combining entertainment with a reasonable modicum of instruction .

		Her manner is facile , she has an instinct for effective points , and she constructs a plot with no little skill .

		Her latest novels are '' The House of the Wizard '' and '' The Cardinal 's Mus - keteer . ''

		The former deals with the court of
Henry VIII.	PERSON	, and introduces the luckless figure of
Anne Boleyn	PERSON	and the sinister figure of the
Lord Privy Seal	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a pretty romance , provided with a courtly hero and a pert heroine of the customary types .

		In `` The Cardinal 's Musketeer , ''
Miss Taylor	PERSON	has chosen an overworked historical period , and has contrived to tell a story of considerable sustained interest and a certain delicate charm .

		The con - spiracy of
Cinq Mars	ORGANIZATION	is the indirect subject of the narrative , although that luckless personage is kept in the background .

		The great Cardinal appears , however , upon several occasions , but he is too evi - dently a lay figure to be impressive .

		The musketeer - hero is no dashing
Gascon	PERSON	of the Artagnan type , but simply a gentleman who performs his part cred - itably , and proves equal to a number of difficult situations .

		His devotion wins the customary re - ward , and there is the usual sentimental and happy ending .

		Mr.
William J. Locke	PERSON	is a novelist whose stories are always welcome .

		Their workmanship is neat , and they agreeably portray modern English society in its superficial aspects , occasionally also striking some deep chord of human feeling .

		In `` The White Dove '' we have a story of strictly private interest , concerned with two or three peculiarly strong and lovable characters , and with some others whose wickedness provides the necessary foil .

		It is a story of the shadow of past sins falling upon young lives and well-nigh marring them forever .

		It has the defect of a somewhat exaggerated senti - mental ism , and a stern moralist might object to the leniency with which the offenders are dismissed .

		`` 0 white dove of the pity divine '' is the motto upon the title page , and serves to explain the name given to the book .

		`` Pardon 's the word for all '' might have been added as a supplementary motto , for the spirit of forgiveness hovers over the closing pages , and even the villain is made to share in the writer 's largess .

		Mr.
Locke	PERSON	's style is for the most part direct and simple , but glows at times with a poetic touch , and leaves a pleasant impression .

		In writing '' The Bath Comedy , '' Mr. and Mrs.
Castle	PERSON	have again collaborated , as they did in '' The Pride of Jennico . ''

		The result is one of the most delicious pieces of light literature which it has often been our good fortune to read .

		It is a story of Bath in the
latter half of the eighteenth century , 1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 25 the year not too precisely defined . ''

		A sufficient reason for reticence in the matter of exact date will be found in the unfortunate predicament of the then Bishop of Bath and
Wells	LOCATION	; undoubtedly a most mortifying episode in the life of an invariably dig - nified Divine . ''

		As there were several Bishops of Bath and
Wells	PERSON	during the period concerned , no cause for scandal is given .

		This episode , amusing as it is , figures as only one of a long series packed into the few days which the story covers .

		As inci - dent follows upon incident , each touched with the very spirit of comedy , the delight of the reader grows apace , and he feels that he would gladly re - main in such company for an indefinite period .

		The artful minx who provides the story with all its complication is so fascinating a study in femininity that we can not feel very harshly toward her , although a severe moralist would find her conduct highly reprehensible .

		The book offers so many surprising developments , and is so bubbling with mirth , that we are reluctant to think that we shall know the heroine no longer .

		As far as the story has a serious side , it is to be found in the note of passion that occasionally makes itself heard , and in the faithful study which it presents of the language and manners of English fashionable life over a hundred years ago .

		Mr.
Weyman	PERSON	, in the search for material fit for his purposes as a novelist , seems to have abandoned
Continental	ORGANIZATION	themes for good , and to have settled upon the English historical past as the best field for the display of his ingenuity .

		This material is less romantic than the other , but he is more intimately acquainted with it , and his later novels upon En - glish themes have more reality than his earlier novels upon French ones .

		The habit of the romancer still clings to him , and his invention is as fresh as ever , but it is impossible to claim for the period in which he has elected to work of late the same sort and degree of interest afforded by the period of his first books .

		With the best will in the world , one can not find the
England	LOCATION	of the later Stuarts as satisfactory a subject for romantic exploration as the
France	LOCATION	of
Henry IV	ORGANIZATION	.

		and of Richelieu .

		Mr.
Weyman	PERSON	's latest story is entitled ''
Sophia	PERSON	, '' and is a tale of the years of Queen
Anne	PERSON	.

		The interest is strictly social and private , political history having little to do with the occurrences described .

		The heroine is a wayward young woman , sought for her fortune by a villainous Irish adventurer , and saved from his persecution by an English gentleman of mature years , whose grave sincerity she at first despises , but who in the end wins her affection .

		The story has much variety of both incident and character , and leads through one desperate adventure after another to a conclusion that is satisfactory to everybody who deserves to be satisfied .

		The plot is of a nature to strain the probabilities , and there is a melodramatic accumu - lation of horrors , but the narrative is at least saved from prolixity , and holds the interest of the reader unabated .

		Not that the author 's style is unattractive , or his subject in itself uninteresting ; but it is dreary work to plod through eight hundred pages of ugly print , for what might have been better said in two hundred .

		Mr.
Finck	PERSON	's contention is that the ancients , and the modern men who in savage life keep up ancient conditions , did not and do not experience the passion of romantic love .

		In other words , romantic love is of recent development and is found only in the upper stage of culture civilization .

		The author begins with an analysis of the emotion , in which he finds just fourteen ingredients no more , no less .

		These ingredients are conveniently and neatly divided into two groups , of just seven each .

		There are seven egoistic ingredients individual preference , monop - olism , jealousy , coyness , hyperbole , mixed moods , and pride ; there are seven altruistic ingredients sympathy , affection , gallantry , self-sacrifice , adora - tion , purity , admiration of personal beauty .

		The ancients , savages , barbarians , even the Orientals , may have sensual love with the seven egoistic ingre - dients ; but only modern civilized white men have real romantic love , with the lately developed seven altruistic ingredients .

		And , alas , but few modern civilized white men have experienced this supreme emotion .

		Such is Mr.
Finck	PERSON	's theme , drawn out through eight hundred pages , illogical , repetitious , tiresome .

		He assumes that anthropologists gener - ally assert that all human beings have fully devel - oped love of the romantic type , and always have had .

		He then proceeds to demonstrate their errors .

		Probably few anthropologists would now , or ever , deny Mr.
Finck	PERSON	's fundamental thought , that love is a growth and a development .

		In demonstrating his claim , Mr.
Finck	PERSON	follows highly unsatisfactory methods .

		Starting by asserting the absolute un - trustworthiness of certain authors , he quotes them in his own support when it suits him .

		Passages are quoted in support of his contention at one point , which are absolutely opposed to conclusions which he draws elsewhere .

		Insisting on literal accuracy as the part of all others , he himself is careless in reference and statement .

		Thus , he quotes
Charles A. Leland	PERSON	and
Lewis A. Morgan	PERSON	, and refers -LRB- un - kindly -RRB- in a footnote to J. S. Wood : these names are all wrong .

		He states that
Lewis H. Morgan	PERSON	lived many years among the Iroquois , and that he knew more about the Iroquois than anyone else : both false statements .

		Usually these would be small matters to criticize , but they become glaring blun - ders considering Mr.
Finck	PERSON	's merciless demands upon others .

		Mr.
Finck	PERSON	waxes sarcastic at the ex - pense of the barbarians whose '' love '' but shortly outlasts the loss or death of the loved woman ; he is ever severe with people who '' love '' more than 26 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, The earth as a battle-field .

		one at a time .

		Plainly , consistency demands that he considers romantic love as single and life-long .

		How surprising , then , that he insists upon telling us more than once that he has been -LRB- romantically -RRB- in love several times .

		Mr.
Finck	PERSON	has been an indus - trious reader , and has really gathered a great mass of material .

		Had he been scientific in method , and constructive instead of bitterly and partisanly de - structive , he might have rendered a real service to science and made a more interesting book , which should attempt to trace the growth and development of the love sentiment from its low savage beginnings up to its most beautiful culmination .

		We regret that he has missed such an opportunity .

		War is just now the all-absorbing topic , and rumors of wars to come fill the air a sorry sequel to the Czar 's
Peace Congress	ORGANIZATION	, that promised so much and would seem to have achieved so little either in the sphere of events or in the public mind .


South Africa	LOCATION	is lit with battle-flames in a contest so savage that the losses on one side must soon equal the total forces of the other ; our own country is engaged in the bloody subjugation of far distant islands in the ironically - named
Pacific	LOCATION	;
France	LOCATION	has a new score to settle with
Perfidious Albion	PERSON	, and boasts ominously that she was '' never before so strong as now '' ; relations between
Russia	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	are in a state of most dangerously unstable equilibrium ; a great conflagration seems imminent in
China	LOCATION	; German interests are growing apace in revolution-ridden
South America	LOCATION	; and Senator Lodge is well to the fore at
Washington	LOCATION	.

		That war has suddenly developed a new horror , in the battle-songs of Mr.
Alfred Austen	PERSON	, gives no pause to the belligerent humor of the times .

		In Anglo-Saxondom , the voice of the man of peace is drowned by the strident clamor of Kipling and his kind .

		To adapt the famous phrase of Abbe '' Sieyes in the Reign of Terror , of what avail is the glass of wine of moderate civilized men like Mr.
John Morley	PERSON	amid such a torrent of brandy ?

		Man , after all , appears to be , as
Palmerston	LOCATION	cynically said , by na - ture '' a fighting and quarrelling animal , '' and must have his fill of battle and slaughter regularly every three or four decades .

		Never at any previous pe - riod of the world 's history has that senseless , savage thing , race hatred , been so rife and so actively dis - seminated .

		Books reflecting the turn of the popular mind , all sorts and conditions of war-books , thrive and multiply .

		Some of them , by gilding and glori - fying war , pour oil on the flame , and actively fur - ther the work of Satan 's agents in the newspapers ; others , of a more truthful and literal sort , by paint - ing honestly the true face of war , with its squalor , ugliness , and infernal horror and brutality , make for peace , and render service to God and man .

		But reports of slaughter the world must have , now that the business is going on so briskly and with such promise of increase in the near future ; and the war-correspondent is having his day .

		Not to be altogether out of it , in the matter of making hay The story of
China	LOCATION	a * a nation .

		while the sun shines , older war-correspondents , who can tell of past wars now fading into relatively an - cient history , are bestirring themselves and raking over the embers of memory for matters of old expe - rience still worth recounting .

		A writer of this sort , and one with a turn for the picturesque , the senti - mental , and the melodramatic , is Mr.
Irving Montague	PERSON	, for many years war artist and corre - spondent of the '' Illustrated
London	LOCATION	News . ''

		Mr.
Montague	PERSON	now issues a readable little book of sketches -LRB- most of them with the short-story flavor -RRB- drawn from his recollections of the Franco-German and Russo-Turkish wars , the Spanish civil wars , and the days of the
Paris	LOCATION	Commune , and collectively entitled '' Things I Have Seen in War '' -LRB-
Wessels	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Some of the titles are : '' An Encounter with Kurds , '' '' Rescued by the Red Cross , '' '' Round About the Redoubts ,
Plevna	LOCATION	, '' '' Osman 's Last Stand , '' '' A Harem En Dfehabiltt '' `` Woman 's Influence at the Front , '' etc. .

		The sketches are sufficiently spirited , and there are sixteen illustrations by the author .

		To wr ite a history of
China	LOCATION	appro - priate for the '' Stories of the Na - tiong gerie8 -LRB- p utnam -RRB- woul -LRB- J geem a difficult task in condensation and elimination .

		Yet Mr.
Robert K. Douglas	PERSON	has accomplished this feat in a surprisingly entertaining fashion , for he has so combined interesting incidents with the names of men and places absolutely unfamiliar to American ears as to enlighten the reader and hold his attention .

		Probably the English reader , by reason of greater familiarity with Chinese politics and history , will find less to interest him in this work than will the American ; but for the latter the author has rendered a real service in his delin - eation of Chinese government and diplomacy , and more than all in his characterization of Chinese methods of thought and feeling .

		The history of
China	LOCATION	can by no possibility be condensed satisfac - torily into such small compass .

		The author him - self has recognized this , and has wisely chosen to confine himself to stating the main points of his story in such order as to preserve the historical se - quence , while national Chinese characteristics , as exemplified when in contact with various foreign civilizations , are dwelt upon in some detail .

		The most positive impression received is that of the intense pride and sense of superiority with which the Chinese authorities regard all ideas and customs foreign to their own conception of life .

		This is not merely an intolerance of Western ideas , but an ab - solute contempt for them , as manifestations of an inferior civilization , a contempt based upon the belief that the nations of the earth are glad to do homage to the government of
China	LOCATION	, and that
China	LOCATION	's intellectual development surpasses that of all other countries .

		This point of view seems , and really is , incomprehensible to the citizen of a mod - ern nation ; for , well as he thinks he understands the Chinese mind , he can not realize the Chinese indifference to governmental corruption , lethargy ,

		and incapability .

		The inability of peoples of di - verse methods of thought to understand each other is here , as always , a cause of frequent trouble , and after recounting diplomatic attempts toward the reasonable settlement of various disputes Mr.
Douglas	PERSON	emphatically asserts that the only success - ful method of dealing with
China	LOCATION	, for a country at variance with that power , is to reach a conclusion based on just , not selfish , principles , and then to use force if necessary in putting that conclusion into effect .

		Just now , when the '' open door '' in
China	LOCATION	is being so constantly exploited , it is a little surprising that the author should fail to enlarge upon the merits or demerits of that policy , or fail to assume the prophetic tone .

		Happily , however , he has confined himself to history , and his work closes with a brief account of the war with
Japan	LOCATION	.

		The book has many illustrations , excellent in them - selves , but having no particular connection with the text . ''

		Breezy '' is doubtless the review - er 's inevitable word for
Lilian Bell	PERSON	's little volume of impressions of for - eign lands , entitled `` As Seen by Me '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , and the '' breeziness '' sometimes reaches the ty - phonic pitch .

		In the course of her perigrinations abroad , the author visited
London	LOCATION	,
Paris	LOCATION	,
Moscow	LOCATION	,
Rome	LOCATION	,
Cairo	LOCATION	,
Constantinople	LOCATION	,
Athens	LOCATION	, etc. , and her account of how the effete Old World impressed her is at least refreshingly candid .

		For the rest , the quality of the book may be indicated by the follow - ing passage from it , which is prompted by
Miss Bell	ORGANIZATION	's mortification at the relatively sober dress worn by our official representatives abroad : '' Jef - fersonian simplicity !

		How I despise it !


Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	, I believe , was the first populist .

		We had had gentlemen for Presidents before him , but he was the first one who rooted for votes with the common by catering to the gutter instead of to the skyline , and the tail end of his policy is to be seen in the mortifying appearance of our highest offi - cials and representatives .

		Hinc illce lachrymce !

		... I have worked myself into such a towering rage over this subject that there is no getting down to earth gracefully or gradually .

		I have not pol - ished off the matter by any manner of means .

		I have only just started in , but a row of stars will cool me off . ''

		-LRB- A row of cooling asterisks follows -RRB- .

		Miss Bell 's giddy little book is not without a cer - tain cleverness , but can not in candor be said to '' cater to the skyline . ''

		The wth century W .

		e like the beginning of Mr. Bl - ow we might bridge
S. Brooks	PERSON	's '' Story of the Nineteenth Century '' -LRB-
Lothrop	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- better than its close .

		He wrote too soon for the crowning enormity of European aggression in
China	LOCATION	, but he went far enough to have been able to draw a striking analogy between the glories of the French Revolution going out in Napoleonic imperialism , and the glories of the latter-day Democracy which he lauds so highly dimming and degrading them - selves with wars of exploitation and conquest in
the Philippines	LOCATION	, or
South Africa	LOCATION	, or the province of Tientsin , as the case may be .

		At least there was no shadowy pretence of philanthropy or civilization a century ago , and wars of conquest were wars , not benevolences .

		We learn from Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	that on
November 24 , 1899	DATE	, `` Aguinaldo 's Philippine re - volt -LSB- was -RSB- overthrown , '' a pleasant bit of news which we are puzzled to account for either as be - lated or prophetic .

		His closing lines inform us that the Nineteenth Century '' steps grandly in the ad - vance as the flower and pride of all the centuries since Christ came to
Bethlehem	LOCATION	, and taught men that Golden Rule which , after nineteen hundred years of slow and sullen schooling , is to become the motive and creator of the great things which the new century holds in store for man . '' ''

		A. lovelier faith their happier crown ; But history laughs and weeps it down , '' sings Mr.
William Watson	PERSON	; and while we can not but envy Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	the robustness of his ethical digestion , we can not agree that he is doing his readers a service in twisting the facts of recent years into a support for the Golden Rule as distin - guished from the rule of gold .

		The American seems to be getting possessed of the thought that the way to remedy national faults is to turn away the head lest they be seen .

		Given an interest in science , it would be d !

		ffic f J ' ma g ine a more , at - tractive book than '' Flame ,
Elec	ORGANIZATION	- tricity , and the Camera '' -LRB-
Doubleday & McClure Company	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		And if the reader brings to the book no prepossessions in favor of scientific knowledge , it is almost impossible to conceive of his carrying away none with him after reading it .

		The salient feature of the work is the description of applied science from the first time when man was able to command fire as a servant down to the present era of varied wonders , each more amazing than the last .

		Those who were born in time to have their daguerreotypes taken -LRB- and Mr. lies reminds us that
Miss Draper	PERSON	, whose face was the first to be portrayed by the com - bined use of sunlight and chemicals , is still living -RRB- have a certain advantage over their juniors in this very feeling of wonder ; not being born to it after the manner of the younger generation , successive discoveries are not taken as matters of course indeed , there be those of us to whom the telephone is not quite real , and the phonograph uncanny .

		But to all , young or old , this book must make its appeal .

		Albeit science has lent much of its best effort to the horrible art of destruction known as war , it affords the best argument for peace , if only that our civilization may live long enough to avail itself of the countless benefits of which nothing but savage and barbarous greed can now deprive us .

		In addition to all that appears on the surface of Mr.
Iles	PERSON	's work , there is a pervasive argument which proves that every new step forward in the way of increased resources reacts and interacts 28 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, upon the whole body of science in granting another point of view , and so fairly forcing still another step by which the process is to be repeated .

		A cyclopedia of Persons who are fastidious about correspondence their stationery , and especially those and heraldry .

		wno affect heraldic blazonry thereon , will do well to consult Mr.
F. Schuyler Mathews	PERSON	's pretty and carefully prepared little manual entitled The Writing Table of the Twentieth Century '' -LRB-
Brentano	ORGANIZATION	's -RRB- .

		The book forms an elementary ac - count of heraldry -LRB- especially designed for the needs of American readers -RRB- , art , engraving , and the estab - lished forms for correspondence , and contains over three hundred illustrations by the author , which include the armorial bearings and devices of over five hundred Colonial American families .

		Those who choose to decorate their note-paper , etc. , with these old-world symbolic insignia should remember that nothing is more vulgar and ludicrous in the eyes of the initiated than solecisms and improprieties in the use of them .

		The question whether or no the use of them at all in democratic
America	LOCATION	be a solecism we do not care to discuss just now .

		But , at all events , if they are to be used they should be used correctly and with strict regard to prescribed heraldic form , and only by those whose clear and demonstrable hereditary right it is to do so .

		A '' bogus '' coat-of - arms means a '' bogus '' man ; and there is surely no more pitiful spectacle of the kind in the world than an American thus fraudulently posing as a scion of the feudal aristocracy of
Europe	LOCATION	adding , as it were , the guilt of apostasy to the meanness of petty larceny .

		After a general introduction discussing pro and con the propriety of bearing a coat-of-arms in
America	LOCATION	, Mr.
Mathews	PERSON	proceeds to treat in detail of the principles and insignia of heraldry , of visiting cards , cards of invitation , wedding invita - tions and announcements , bookplates , monograms , dies , seals , etc. , and , lastly , of writing papers .

		The book is tastefully illustrated , and should form a helpful and graceful adjunct to the home writing - table .

		Without conceding that the
Bacon	PERSON	- ian theorv of the authorship of the Bon-Shake * peare .

		Shakespearean dramas has ever at - tained the importance which warrants much serious discussion , it is pleasant to observe that Mr.
Charles Allen	PERSON	has written an interesting book in his '' Notes on the Bacon-Shakespeare Question '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Himself a lawyer , the author performs a service in clearing away the doubts which former legal com - mentators have raised in respect of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's legal attainments not , indeed , by denying them , but rather by extolling them to a point where the uninstructed could point the finger and say , `` No one but a lawyer could have known this ; Shake - speare was not a lawyer ; ergo ,
Bacon	PERSON	wrote it . ''

		Mr.
Allen	PERSON	shows , quite conclusively , that the poet was as often wrong as right in his use of legal terms and ideas , and that he nowhere displays more knowledge of the law than a man of property , A lawyer 's notes on Palmistry , with modern adaptations .

		such as he , would ordinarily display .

		By cleverly reversing the process just noted , the author easily proves the plays to contain such a knowledge of stage-craft and play-acting as
Bacon	PERSON	could not have acquired without a complete overthrow of the facts in his biography , saying in effect , `` No one but an actor-manager could have known this ;
Bacon	PERSON	was not an actor-manager ; ergo ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	wrote it . ''

		The book evinces careful and intelligent reading , and is evidently a work of love a typical work , in fact , for a highly cultured lawyer to take up by way of avocation . ''

Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-

		His work is most inclusive , even to the point of containing a plate from Fer - rier 's great work on brain functions in the earlier part , and another from somebody 's phrenology in the later .

		It contains 1,254 original illustrations besides , and is certainly set forth in sufficient detail to tell any sort of fortune which is not too uncon - ventional for modern discussion .

		That it fills a public want can not be doubted , for it would appear that
America	LOCATION	is perfectly capable of suiting its popular science to its popular politics , discussing astrology and protection , palmistry and imperial - ism , with an intense sobriety which augurs volumes for the strenuous life .

		As Montaigne remarks in another place , `` the higher the ape climbs , the longer his tail appears . ''

		Father 's Business '' -LRB- The Mersbon Company -RRB- is the story of a preacher who made a desperate attempt to serve God and Mammon , and has in it much about a strike and the aspirations of the laboring classes .

		Artless to the last degree in any literary sense , the very naivete of the narrative tempts the reader on and on , until the conclusion quite as artless as the rest is reached .

		And when reached it will be apparent that the author is very much in earnest , and takes to heart the thought that there is so little place made for the poor in churches which are preparing a way for the rich without the use of the needle 's eye .

		Many earnest men have observed with sadness the difference between the Christian life set forth in the New Testament and the one led by professing Christians in the modern commercial world : the difference appears radical in

Ornamental	ORGANIZATION	,

		This book is the longest and most important work by MISS CORELLI published since '' The Sorrows of Satan '' From THE WORCESTER SPY .

		M The story is one full of pathos and reality . ''

		From THE
NEW YORK	LOCATION	TIMES SATURDAY REVIEW . ''

		In BOY , ' her latest work ,
Miss Corelli	PERSON	is at her best .

		In this she has written a story which is at once healthy in tendency and in the main true to the facts of human nature .

		In this story the
Transvaal	LOCATION	war makes its appearance in contemporaneous fiction before it is over .

		The story is excellently constructed , and is told with charming simplicity of style .

		The char - acters are well drawn , and the whole atmosphere of the tale is lifting .

		As a study of the pos - sible effects of good influences in overcoming the tendencies of heredity it is thoughtful , and it will add to the solidity of its author 's reputation . ''

		From THE
BOSTON	LOCATION	COURIER . '' '

		BOY ' is one of the most wonderful delineations of mental development that has ever been published .

		The author 's style is , as usual with
Miss Corelli	PERSON	, such that tells the tale at its best , that holds the attention from the opening of the book until its closing .

		It informs of the earnestness of the writer upon her subject , who at times uses sarcasm in a mighty way .

		To ' BOY ' is certainly owing extensive perusal and popularity . ''

		57 A YEARS PROGRESS IN SECONDARY AND HIGHER EDUCATION .

		Only scattering and fragmentary reports of the annual meeting of the
National Educational Association	ORGANIZATION	, held last week in
Charleston	LOCATION	, S. C. , have yet reached the public .

		Scattering and fragmentary as these reports are , yet , taken in connection with the elaborate programme pre - viously published , they bring under survey nearly the whole field of education , public and private .

		Among the many important subjects discussed , none surpassed those relating to secondary and higher education , especially as these relate to each other .

		The truth is that in the two fields or in the one field , if we are to consider them as being but one very un - usual progress was made during the year just closed .

		A resume of the leading facts consti - tuting this progress may aid readers of THE DIAL to grasp the import of the
Charleston	LOCATION	discussions , and to discern whither , for the time , the educational affairs of our country are tending .

		The
Committee on College Entrance Re	ORGANIZATION	- quirements , appointed in pursuance of action taken in
Denver	LOCATION	in
1895	DATE	, finished its labors and published its report in time for presentation and discussion at the
Los Angeles	LOCATION	meeting a year ago .

		The main object of this Report , it will be remembered , was not to fix or to recom - mend requirements for admission to the col - leges and universities , but rather to make up a list of studies deemed suitable for this purpose , to establish a series of units or measures , and to urge the adoption of this list upon the sec - ondary and higher schools .

		To repeat a figure that was used in the discussions at
Chicago	LOCATION
last year	DATE	, the aim of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	was to create a uniform educational coinage with which stu - dents going to college could discharge their entrance indebtedness , the amount of which indebtedness the various institutions would fix for themselves .

		Four periods a week for a school year was made the unit of value the dollar of this new coin of the educational realm ; and the colleges were strongly urged not to break up these dollars into '' change , '' save perhaps in a single instance that is more apparent than real .

		To carry out this central idea , much more college entrance-work was approved or '' stamped '' than any institution could require or most secondary schools could furnish ; thus preparing the way for a liberal list of electives in the secondary schools and of entrance alternatives at the colleges .

		Still , the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	strove to hold both electives and alternatives in check , by insisting upon certain 44 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, constant studies : namely , four units in foreign languages , two units in mathematics , two in English , one in history , and one in science .

		Beyond these constants , it was assumed that the schools would do the work they were best fitted to do .

		Important discussions and legislation have followed this report , conforming in general to the lines the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	had marked out .

		In fact , no one of the numerous reports which the
National Educational Association	ORGANIZATION	has published in the last few years has been followed by hap - pier immediate results .

		The
Board of Educa	ORGANIZATION	- tion of the
City of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	has adopted a programme of studies that is in many respects in accord with the recommendations of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	; while a committee is now at work arranging for an approximate uniformity of college entrance requirements in the
State of Illinois	ORGANIZATION	.

		In
May last	DATE	,
the Association of Colleges	ORGANIZATION	and Preparatory Schools of the
Middle States	LOCATION	and
Maryland	LOCATION	adopted a plan of organization for a
College Entrance Examination Board	ORGANIZATION	that should do the work of examining for all the institutions directly interested .

		This move - ment had its immediate rise in an address upon the subject delivered before
the Association	ORGANIZATION	in
December , 1899	DATE	, by Dr.
Nicholas Murray Butler	PERSON	.

		The new board , which is the central feature of the plan of organization , consists of the president or authorized representative of each college or university of the
Middle States	LOCATION	and
Maryland	LOCATION	having a freshman class of not fewer than fifty students , counting both the course in Arts and in Sciences , and of five representatives of secondary schools to be chosen annually by
the Association	ORGANIZATION	from among those that adopted the plan , or in such manner as it may direct .

		The machinery and methods of this board are topics that lie aside from our present path .

		It suffices to say that the ob - ject of the board , as expressed in the resolutions adopted at
Trenton	LOCATION	in
December	DATE	, is '' to bring about , as rapidly as possible , agreement upon a uniform statement as to each subject required by two or more colleges for admission , '' and to * ' hold or cause to be held , at convenient points , in
June	DATE	of each year , a series of college admis - sion examinations , with uniform tests in each subject , and issue certificates based upon the results of such examinations '' ; the several col - leges in the
Middle States	LOCATION	and
Maryland	LOCATION	to accept the certificates so issued , '' so far as they go , in lieu of their.own separate examinations . ''

		This scheme will go into operation the coming autumn , and the first examinations will be held in
June	DATE	of next year .

		The subjects that have been chosen are English , history ,
Latin	LOCATION	, Greek , French , German , mathematics , physics , chem - istry , botany , and zoology .

		The institutions represented are
Barnard	ORGANIZATION	,
Bryn Mawr	LOCATION	,
Colum	PERSON	- bia ,
Rutgers	ORGANIZATION	, Swath more ,
Union	ORGANIZATION	,
Vassar	LOCATION	, and Woman 's Colleges , and
Colgate	ORGANIZATION	,
Cornell	ORGANIZATION	,
Princeton	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, and
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	Uni - versities ; or all the institutions within the geo - graphical limits described which have freshman classes of fifty or more students .

		These names are at once a pledge that the new plan will be thoroughly tried , and also that , if successful , it will exert a far-reaching influence .

		The board of examination does not propose to interfere directly with college entrance requirements in respect either to the studies or to the amount of work and study that shall be demanded for admission ; but only to establish and carry on a mint for the coining of money that shall have a uniform value , with which students can pay their college entrance charges .

		However , re - sults that are not formally provided for are quite certain - to follow .

		The plan will save much labor and expense ; cause the necessary work to be better done ; bring about a healthful degree of uniformity in studies ; save students , preparatory teachers , and professors -LRB- deans especially -RRB- much unnecessary work and per - plexity ; cultivate good relations among institu - tions , and between institutions and the public ; and tend to abolish what Dr.
Butler	PERSON	has called '' our educational atomism . ''

		Perhaps it is too much to expect
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	colleges and univer - sities to adopt at present the Western plan of receiving freshmen on the leaving certificates of approved preparatory schools ; but while they are moving slowly toward that goal , the
Middle States	LOCATION	and
Maryland	LOCATION	may well be congratulated on the long step they have taken in establishing this
Board of Examinations	ORGANIZATION	.

		Henceforth , Chaos ought not to sit as umpire over the colleges and universities of that region , and , by deciding , more to embroil the fray .

		Much the most important action taken by any single college or university during the year in respect to entrance is the new requirements for admission to
Columbia College	ORGANIZATION	.

		Elemen - tary French and German have long been col - lege studies , and within the last few years some institutions have put elementary Greek on the same list .


Columbia	ORGANIZATION	has now taken the unpre - cedented step of adding elementary Latin .

		The immediate result will be that a student who has taken a non-Latin course in the secondary
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 45 school may enter
Columbia College	ORGANIZATION	and pro- ceed to the degree of
A.B.	LOCATION	without prejudice arising from that fact .

		The total requirement for admission is fixed at fifteen points , of which three must be in English and three in elemen - tary mathematics ; while the remaining nine may be selected , in measures ranging from one point to four points , from a total of twenty-six points to be made in
Latin	LOCATION	,
Greek	LOCATION	, history , French , German , mathematics , physics , Span - ish , chemistry , botany , physiography , and zool - ogy .

		At
the University of Michigan	ORGANIZATION	, also , the entrance requirements have been revised in the interest of simplicity and elasticity .

		At the
Washington	LOCATION	meeting of
the National Educational Association	ORGANIZATION	, two years ago , the writer of this article presented a paper in the department of Higher Instruction on the possi - bility and desirability of forming a federation of colleges and universities in the
United States	LOCATION	similar to the
Association of American Medical Colleges	ORGANIZATION	.

		After discussion , a committee of five was appointed to report at the uext annual meeting of the department a practical plan of effecting such a federation , and to offer recom - mendations with reference to the same ; but this committee was not heard from last year at
Los Angeles	LOCATION	.

		However , another movement , somewhat similar to this one in the outcome , but wholly separate from it in origin and original purpose , has eventuated in an organ - ization known as
the Association of American Universities	ORGANIZATION	.

		A circular letter , signed by the presidents of
Harvard	LOCATION	,
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	,
Johns Hop	PERSON	- kins ,
Chicago	LOCATION	, and
California	LOCATION	Universities , was sent to certain selected institutions , inviting them to a conference to be held in
Chicago	LOCATION	in
February	DATE	, at the time of the meeting of the
Department of Superintendence	ORGANIZATION	, to consider primarily the relations of American schools and students to German universities .

		In the course of the discussions at the conference , this sub - ject was quietly dropped , and an association bearing the name already given was organized .

		The object of this organization is the consid - eration of matters of common interest relating to graduate study , and its membership is natur - ally limited to institutions that are actually engaged in giving advanced or graduate instruc - tion .

		The initial membership consists of
Cali	LOCATION	- fornia ,
Chicago	LOCATION	,
Clark	PERSON	,
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	,
Cornell	ORGANIZATION	,
Harvard	LOCATION	,
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	,
Michigan	LOCATION	,
Pennsyl	PERSON	- vania ,
Princeton	LOCATION	,
Stanford	ORGANIZATION	,
Wisconsin	LOCATION	, and
Yale Universities	ORGANIZATION	, and the
Catholic University of America	ORGANIZATION	; and provision is made for length - ening the list at the annual conference , by the admission of other institutions , on the invita - tion of the executive committee endorsed by a three-fourths vote of the members .

		It is ex - pected by the founders of this association that it will do something of value for fixing the standard for the Ph.D. degree , and for its proper administration .

		It may prove to be , what one writer has already declared that it is , '' a long step toward complete university coop - eration . ''

		To explain in full the present status of the proposition to found a national institution of learning at the national capital is not an easy matter .

		It appears , however , to present three distinct forms .

		The first is the plan , which has
Washington	LOCATION	for its author , to establish at the capital of the nation a statutory university .

		This plan is now pending before the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	in the form of '' A Bill to Establish the Univer - sity of the
United States	LOCATION	, '' introduced by Mr.
Depew	PERSON	.

		The second form is the plan to organ - ize for the purposes of instruction the various scientific facilities , resources , and materials belonging to the government at
Washington	LOCATION	, such as libraries and museums , collections and laboratories , under the supervision and over - sight of the Regents of the
Smithsonian Insti	ORGANIZATION	- tution , which forms the centre of the new scheme ; the instruction furnished to be limited to students who are graduates of properly ac - credited institutions , or those who are other - wise properly qualified ; and no degrees to be conferred in connection with such instruction .

		The third form of the proposition is to make the
Bureau of Education	ORGANIZATION	, rather than the
Smith	PERSON	- sonian Institution , the administrative centre of the
Bureau of Research	ORGANIZATION	, as the new organiza - tion is sometimes called .

		Of these three plans , the first is presse.d more or less vigorously by a national committee of some four hundred members , having Dr.
John W. Hoyt	PERSON	as its chairman ; the second is urged with much per - sistence by the
American Association of Agri	ORGANIZATION	- cultural Colleges and Experiment Stations ; while the third does not appear to have any organized support .

		The committee of fifteen appointed by the President of the
National Council of Educa	ORGANIZATION	- tion , in
July , 1898	DATE	, to investigate the entire subject of the establishment of a
National Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity , has pronounced decidedly against the plan of a statutory institution , and has virtu - ally , if not formally , declared in favor of some alternative plan .

		The attitude of this commit - tee is well shown by two of the propositions that it has adopted .

		46 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, '' The government is not called upon to maintain at the
Capital a University	ORGANIZATION	in the ordinary sense of that term . '' ''

		That a sub-committee be requested to prepare for consideration by the full committee a detailed plan by which students who have taken a baccalaureate degree , or who have had an equivalent training , may have full and systematic advantage of the opportunities for ad - vanced instruction and research which may now or may hereafter be afforded by the government ; such a plan to include the cooperation with the
Smithsonian Insti	ORGANIZATION	- tution of the universities willing to accept a share of the responsibilities incident thereto . ''

		For some reason , the full committee did not at its
February	DATE	meeting adopt the report of the sub - committee , but , after discussion , referred it back to the sub-committee without action .

		It was expected that the subject would come up for final disposition at the late meeting of the
National Educational Association	ORGANIZATION	, in sub - stantial accordance with the above report .

		So the matter stands at present .

		Unless
Congress	ORGANIZATION	shall sooner cut the Gordian knot , which is hardly to be expected , the next step , if any , will no doubt be taken by the Regents of the
Smithsonian	ORGANIZATION	Institution .

		Conjectures as to what they will probably do would be pre - mature .

		It is known , however , that while the Regents are in sympathy with the ultimate purpose of the
American Association of Agri	ORGANIZATION	- cultural Colleges and Experiment Stations , they find themselves seriously embarrassed when they take up the question of the provis - ion of funds with which to do the work that would be required , and the further question of correlating formal instruction or teaching with their own original and primary office of ad - vancing knowledge among men .

		To quote one of the abler organs of public opinion : '' One of the most interesting developments of spe - cialization now going on in higher education in this country is that which looks toward a better training for business men and civil servants .

		Whatever the pre - vailing view of the primary objects of a college or a university , and however narrowly one may be disposed to limit its essential field , there can be no question that the most progressive of these institutions are now zeal - ously seeking to put themselves in touch with the prac - tical business needs of the times , and to fit their stu - dents for participation in every-day affairs . ''

		Proofs of this tendency have become too pronounced to be overlooked or underrated .

		The
Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	,
the School of Political Science of Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	, and the elaborate courses in history and economics at several of the stronger institutions , were the forerunners of the new movement .

		Two years ago ,
the University of California	ORGANIZATION	founded a
School of Commerce	ORGANIZATION	, including in its curriculum studies in history , political science , commercial and international law , technological subjects , and modern languages ; and laying emphasis upon our commercial relations with
Asia	LOCATION	.

		A little more than a year ago , the
New York Chamber of Commerce	ORGANIZATION	determined to cooperate with
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	in establishing a collegi - ate course of instruction in commerce , to be open to high-school graduates , and to cover four years .


Dartmouth College	ORGANIZATION	has recently announced the
Tuck School	ORGANIZATION	, with a programme of studies bearing directly upon preparation for business and administrative life .

		Again ,
the University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	has also taken steps to organize a
School of Commerce	ORGANIZATION	, while the
University of Michigan	ORGANIZATION	has just sent out an announcement of special courses in higher commercial education and in public adminis - tration .

		These courses are especially intended for students , graduates or under-graduates , who desire to specialize in history , economics , and related subjects ; but they are also thrown open to those who wish to prepare for the polit - ical and social side of newspaper work , for teaching history and political science in col - leges and high schools , for philanthropic and pastoral work , or for diplomatic or consular service .

		These several schools and courses of instruc - tion are not yet fully organized , but that con - summation will not be long deferred .

		The causes that have produced them , and that promise to produce others like them , call for but the slightest suggestion .

		They are the in - dustrial and political , the commercial and so - cial , activities of the times .

		Such schools and courses would no doubt have come in time , had the nation moved on in its old path ; but they have been materially hastened by the fuller development of the national self-consciousness that has followed events in our recent history .

		Those persons who adopt Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	's charac - terization of a university as a place where noth - ing useful is taught , are not likely to take kindly to the new development ; but they are no more likely to oppose to it a successful re - sistance .

		In fact , we are but following in the footsteps of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Special schools for teach - ing business and administration have already been successfully established in
France	LOCATION	, Ger - many ,
Austria	LOCATION	, and
Italy	LOCATION	the best known of all , perhaps , being the school at Leipsic .

		The new
University of Birmingham	ORGANIZATION	,
England	LOCATION	, will include a faculty of commerce .

		THE DIAL 47 COMMUNICA TIONS .

		DANGERS AND DRAWBACKS IN ENDOWMENTS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The publication , in THE DIAL for
June 16	DATE	, of statistics regarding recent gifts and bequests for educational , religious , and other humane purposes , suggests some further comments .

		In the first place it is to be noticed that not only was the gross amount contributed for
1899	DATE	-LRB-
$ 65,000,000	MONEY	-RRB- much greater than for any other year recorded -LRB- 1893-1899 -RRB- , but the number of con - tributors was nevertheless smaller , making the average amounts contributed one-half larger , than for any pre - vious year .

		In other words , much larger sums were contributed by a smaller number of individuals .

		These statistics do not include , however , endowments under five thousand dollars , though these must have been important , and may even have exceeded in gross amount the sums tabulated .

		Only by knowing the increase or decrease in the gross amount of these smaller endowments can the complete significance of the published statistics concerning larger endowments be determined .

		Since this is not known , we are quite in the dark regarding the relative gross amount of all endowments for
1899	DATE	compared with those for previous years .

		We may sup - pose , however , that they were probably somewhat greater , since the presumptive decrease in smaller en - dowments was very likely more than made up by the increase in very large gifts .

		The impression shining out of the article referred to , that we have entered into a very paradise of institutional endowments , may re - quire modification .

		Since these tabulations seem to show that not more than one in fifty , or possibly one in a hundred , of our millionaires contributed at all , and since single individuals or corporations are known to have accumulated within the single year sums bordering close upon , or exceeding , the entire amount of these tabulations , we should exercise due restraint in judging Ihe self-sacrificing benevolence of this wealthy social class .

		If these statistics for
1899	DATE	really point , as they seem to point , to a future in which many smaller endowments must give place to fewer large ones , to accord perhaps with tendencies toward concentration of wealth , we may well hesitate to express congratulation for any expected future increase in the total amounts .

		As between hav - ing educational and humane institutions supported by many smaller contributions , or by few large ones , by all means if possible let us have the former .

		In the first place , this would signify that the people themselves were financially able and willing to maintain their own cherished institutions ; while a people who are able to have great institutions only through the gifts of the very wealthy are in danger of being blinded by the ameliorating and debauching influences of charity to the paramount duty of obtaining more just economic conditions for society in general .

		Moreover , that any - one should be able by reason of his wealth to influence unduly our religious or educational institutions , is on the whole unfortunate .

		When these institutions are carried on through the support of many persons , there need be little fear of undue domination by any particular benefactor .

		But if an institution owes its existence wholly , or in very large part , to the financial support of one man , he is in a position to exercise very great influ - ence over its management and policy .

		If the endow - ment of institutions had no bearing upon the material welfare of their administrators , and if human action were honestly determined in strict accordance with correct reasoning processes , we should have no occasion to fear the subtle influence of wealth upon our educa - tional or religious institutions .

		But the material wel - fare of the adminstrators is closely wrapped up in the worldly success of these institutions ; and the human mind is wonderfully impressionable , and always prone to be swayed by transient conditions and temptations .

		The destruction of ideals is a subtle and gradual pro- cess , and once begun it is not easy for it to stop .

		Of course , the sort of influence exercised by a munifi - cent donor will depend upon the man .

		His influence may be broad and wholesome , or narrow and injurious .

		But the fact that it is exercised , in a large degree , under practical compulsion , makes it always objection - able .

		Moreover , it is usually , if not always , a secret influence .

		Thus it may happen that an institution which stands before the world as free and sincere , may in fact be in certain respects scarcely more than the hired advocate of a certain rich benefactor .

		I do not say that all large endowments are attended with this insidious influence ; but I do say that the possibility of such influence is real enough to awaken serious mis - givings .

		In times of social and economic ferment and unrest , such as we are living in , it is very important that two institutions , because of their functions as moral and economic teachers , should remain absolutely unham - pered , the church and the college .

		And in view of the well-known ultra-conservative attitude of great wealth , large endowments to such institutions can not at this time be dissociated from economic considerations .

		A prominent type in the commercial world , whose gifts to religious and educational institutions have been large , is deserving of special consideration .

		Great fortunes may sometimes be acquired through sheer unaided ability and force , though also , more likely , with the addition of circumstance and favorable economic condi - tions .

		But it is believed that in the accumulation of such fortunes other elements are sometimes actively concerned , such as an unscrupulous disregard of others ' rights , if not an almost absolute disregard of honor .

		More and more are we seeing men who , through the instrument of political bribery , deliberately purpose to undermine the very foundations of justice and national life in order to enrich themselves , insinuating their influ - ence into religious and educational institutions .

		It is a peculiarly ingenuous innocence which fails to suspect in this a concealed purpose .

		Is there anything more hu - man than the disposition of a corrupt man of social standing to maintain his outward respectability ?

		Could anything be better calculated to ameliorate the harsh - ness of public criticism for public crime than munificent financial encouragement to institutions which stand most for purity and truth ?

		And is it likely that one whose methods of corruption have insinuated themselves into his every political and business association should scruple to insidiously attempt the debasement of moral ideals to the level of his own , if his welfare seemed to demand it ?

		The problem of de-Christianizing the world may be large , but some men glory in large problems .

		Can anyone be found willing to maintain that no progress in this evil direction has been made ?

		The problems confronting the administrators of the immense funds of our endowed institutions are , as stated in THE DIAL 'S article , serious .

		But again I must insist that bestowed funds do have a commercial significance , 48 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, not only by reason of the conditions which created them , or of the possibility of their influence upon moral and economic perceptions and teachings , but also because their administration forces the institutions themselves into commercial activities .

		Large endowments un - doubtedly consist in considerable part of the watered stock of corporations whose dividends depend upon sys - tematic public corruption .

		The first moral problem which administrators have to meet is to determine whether such wealth can honestly be accepted at all -LRB- although this doubtless scarcely presents itself as a real problem -RRB- ; the second , to determine what their atti - tude shall be in the business world upon matters involv - ing business immorality ; and third , that of deciding whether the teachings of the institution concerned shall be permitted to influence detrimentally the possible earnings of invested funds , or to endanger possible future endowments .

		It is not my purpose to pursue this aspect of the matter further .

		But I wish , in finally emphasizing the contention that commercialism is closely twined about all sides of the endowment question , to quote the following statement concerning the property of one of our prominent educational institutions -LRB- made in the ''
Chicago	LOCATION	Tribune '' of
April 28 , 1900	DATE	, by Build - ing Commissioner
McAndrews	PERSON	-RRB- : '' There are rows and rows of unsafe and unsanitary buildings in the Nine - teenth Ward which belonged to the Hull estate and are now owned by
University	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		At least four of these buildings were ordered destroyed , including one devoted to a presumably profitable saloon business .

		Evidently the very poor are paying for the education of the com - fortable classes more directly than some of us had pre - sumed .

		It speaks with peculiar earnestness for the moral sincerity of this institution , that it sees fit to foster a '' social settlement , '' to aid its students in the study of the awful conditions of a '' slum '' neighbor - hood , which it is finding profit in helping to perpetuate .

		The contemplation of a great humane institution is truly inspiring , but none the less if it be the fruit of the generosity of many small donors rather than that of one , or a few , extremely large .

		One of the main pur - poses of this communication is to utter what seems to be a needed warning , that large endowments are prone to foster a complacency regarding the injustices through which much of our great wealth is accumulated .

		If the endowments to a great university may so subvert the moral judgment of its president as to cause him to hold that it matters little how a man obtains his wealth so long as he bestows it properly , surely none of us can be accounted safe from this subtle influence .

Committee	ORGANIZATION	recognized the importance of such a catalogue , and that the plans for cooperative cataloguing now under consideration may open the way to its preparation . ''

		Plans for cooperative cataloguing of books for libra - ries have been put before American librarians at various times during the
last half century	DATE	, and their realization at this time , as decided upon at the
Montreal	LOCATION	conference , will mark in a fitting way the end of a century rich in achievements in librarianship and bibliography , and ripe with promises of a still greater future .

		Cooperative cataloguing for libraries , in order to be successful , must be made according to rules that are a result of a compromise between the conflicting rules and practices of many libraries of different character .

		A bibliography , on the other hand , must follow scientific principles uncompromisingly .

		It is , indeed , doubtful whether libraries like the
Boston	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	public libraries and the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	, engaged as they are in very important work peculiarly their own , could cooperate in an undertaking not directly concerned with their own immediate objects .

		These libraries and a , few others possess the main part of the material for an American bibliography ; but a great mass of material , seemingly of less value , certainly of a more ephemeral nature , will be found in a great number of smaller and obscure libraries .

		This is particularly true of topo - graphical , biographical , and other local literature .

		It is plain that in order to get together all this material laborious research would have to be made in various parts of the country .

		The compilation of such a bibliography as has been planned must necessarily be a work of years , even if undertaken by a considerable number of bibliographers .

		Some plan must therefore be devised whereby the ma - terial will be made available as far as already collected .

		Such a device has been found by the
Committee on Cooperation of the American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	which proposes to make for each title a linotype plate after the plan used in the
John Crerar Library	ORGANIZATION	, and to keep on hand cards printed from these plates .

		The plates and the cards being numbered , it will be possible to publish a list of books on certain subjects , or by certain authors , as soon as the completeness of the material at hand may warrant publication .

		The need of an American bibliography is the most pressing , but by no means the only , need of the Amer - ican bibliographer .

		To give only one example , a new , complete , and trustworthy critical bibliography of bib - liographies might be prepared by the joint labor of bibliographers and scientific specialists .

		A bureau of information in matters bibliographical is a desideratum long felt among bibliographers and scholars .

		Again , there is not in this country a single magazine devoted to scientific and bibliophilic bibliography .

		No library , no publishing house , could think of under - taking a work of the magnitude here suggested .

		The various undertakings outlined can not be attempted ex - cept by a specially founded
Bibliographical Institute	ORGANIZATION	, with a large endowment and a competent staff of bibli - ographers and scientific men .

		An endowment for one institution of this kind would be of as much value as the endowment of ten public libraries .

		If such an institution were founded in connection with a university , there might be a way of realizing the ideal aimed at but not yet even approached in any of the library schools in the country , namely , a real post - graduate course in bibliography and librarianship .

		THE DIAL 49
MR. FISKE	PERSON	ox THE CIVIL , WAR .

		* Laying aside temporarily his general scheme for a continuous series of American histories , Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	now enters one field of the Civil War , and indites '' a purely military narra - tive '' of the campaigns in the
Mississippi	LOCATION	Val - ley , including in this term the whole of the territory drained by the great river and its tributaries .

		This narrative is brought down to the close of the year
1864	DATE	, and thus virtually covers the period of the entire war .

		Indeed , it is the theory of this volume that the war was mainly fought in the great valley , and that it was the achievements of the Federal armies on this Western field which made the war for the Union a success .

		Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	's mode of pre - senting the subject is striking .

		He pictures the aggregation of all the campaigns in this field as one extensive battle , waged on the modern plan , in which the result depends upon skill in flanking .

		The Appalachian chain of mountains had divided the general field into two fields , each of which was to be separately fought for .

		In the
East	LOCATION	, broad flanking opera - tions were not feasible , and the campaigning was largely limited to frontal attacks , which at the end of four years had not carried the
Fed	ORGANIZATION	- eral forces beyond the
James River	LOCATION	.

		The pro- longed contest for the possession of the great Western field was distinguished by a continu - ous succession of flanking movements , of which the most sanguinary battles were incidents , and in which the left flank of the
Confederacy	ORGANIZATION	's
Mississippi Valley	LOCATION	armies was continuously turned .

		Their extreme left was rolled back when the state of
Missouri	LOCATION	was occupied by the Federals .

		Next , the line of defense first estab - lished , with its left resting on the
Ohio	LOCATION	, was turned by the reduction of Forts
Henry	PERSON	and
Donelson	PERSON	, and the Federal occupation of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	below
Columbus	LOCATION	.

		The Confederates established a new line of defense along the railroad running east from
Memphis	LOCATION	, which was in turn flanked as a result of the battles of
Shiloh	LOCATION	, luka , and
Corinth	LOCATION	, and other operations on the
Mississippi	LOCATION	; and the recovery of the entire control of that stream closed a broad flanking movement , and forced the forming of new lines by the Confederates , in a reduced territory .

		Once again was their left turned , * THE
MISSISSIPPI	LOCATION	VALLEY IN THE CIVIL WAR .

		By
John Fiske	PERSON	.


Boston	LOCATION	:
Honghton , Mifflin & Go	ORGANIZATION	.

		when the campaigning around
Chattanooga	LOCATION	terminated in the fall of
Atlanta	LOCATION	and the march to the sea , of all which , Hood 's advance upon
Nashville	LOCATION	and the accompanying battles were but incidents ; and this extensive flanking operation made the ultimate surrender of Lee inevitable .

		In his narrative recital of the main features of these movements , Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	exhibits the breadth of view , keen analysis , and judicious generalization with which the readers of his other writings are familiar .

		As one turns these pages , it is a gigantic game of chess which one sees mapped out before him .

		Island Ten ,
Corinth	LOCATION	,
Vicksburg	LOCATION	,
New Orleans	LOCATION	,
Chattanooga	LOCATION	,
Atlanta	LOCATION	, are squares upon the chess-board ; and the armies and corps of
Grant	LOCATION	,
Sherman	PERSON	,
Thomas	PERSON	,
Johnston	PERSON	,
Pemberton	PERSON	, and Hood , are the pieces and pawns of the magnificent game .

		Grant , on the
Big Black Eiver	ORGANIZATION	, between his antagonists
Pemberton	PERSON	and
Johnston	PERSON	, is no more embarrassed than is the
White Queen	ORGANIZATION	who has invaded the domains of the
Black King	ORGANIZATION	, reserving both direct and diagonal lines of movement ; or than the White Knight who , though surrounded by
Black	ORGANIZATION	adversaries , still has squares unoccupied by them to which he can make his erratic retreat .

		Frequently , Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	finds the peculiar terms of chess most pertinent for his illustrations .

		And this analogy forcibly impresses the necessity of one skilful manager to plan and direct all the de - tails of the great enterprise .

		The several epi - sodes of the war in the West are dictated by the chess-player .

		The recovery of
Missouri	LOCATION	, which , it is here hinted , took the west bank of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	out of the active field of the war ; the steps by which the control of that river was reassumed , namely ,
Fort Donelson	PERSON	and
Shiloh	LOCATION	, the capture of
New Orleans	LOCATION	, the battles of
Corinth	LOCATION	and
Stone River	LOCATION	, and finally the reduction of
Vicksburg	LOCATION	and
Port Hudson	LOCATION	, each of these is but a move upon the mighty chess-board of war .

		Such a capacity for generalization as is recog - nized in Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	finds a congenial opportu - nity in the task of dealing thus comprehensively with the Civil War .

		We find in this book all the charm of his other historical essays .

		His facile pen flows as rapidly and as smoothly through sanguinary campaigns and terrible crises as it has heretofore done through political manoeuvres and intrigue , and the romantic and thrilling experiences of frontier life .

		But Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	has sought to condense so much into this one volume of 360 pages that 50 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, he has apparently pressed out some important episodes altogether , and has sacrificed histor - ical proportion .

		We are transported from the western side of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	to the eastern , with the impression that the operations in the former field are virtually ended by its conquest in the first year of the war .

		The battle of
Helena	ORGANIZATION	, on
July 4 , 1863	DATE	, is a witness to the contrary ; but this engagement is not mentioned by our author .

		He gives , very appropriately , a chapter to Hood 's march upon
Nashville	LOCATION	, undertaken for the purpose of embarrassing Sherman at
Atlanta	LOCATION	.

		But it was in like man - ner that Price had hoped , in
1863	DATE	, to embarrass Grant at
Vicksburg	LOCATION	by the capture of
Helena	ORGANIZATION	.


Fiske	PERSON	says that later , in
September , 1864	DATE	, `` the irrepressible Sterling Price had bounced up once more in
Missouri	LOCATION	. ''

		But he had done more than this in
July , 1863	DATE	: he had gathered an army of 14,000 men , whom he sought to fire to action with the appeal , '' The invaders who seek to subjugate you have been driven from
Arkansas	LOCATION	save at one point ,
Helena	LOCATION	; we go to retake it . ''

		Fiske gives due credit to General
Benjamin M. Prentiss	PERSON	for having '' saved the day '' at
Shiloh	ORGANIZATION	by the persistence and stub - bornness of his resistance to the Confederate onslaughts .

		But
Prentiss	PERSON	rendered more con - spicuous and valuable service at
Helena	LOCATION	, where he brilliantly repelled the impetuous attack of Price 's greatly superior force .

		By stoutly holding with his small army the west bank of the river at
Helena	LOCATION	, he ably complemented the work of Grant at
Vicksburg	LOCATION	, and helped to make it a verity that '' the Father of Waters rolled unvexed to the sea . ''

		No one episode of the war in the West had a more distinct effect upon the whole situation than this march by Price upon
Helena	PERSON	and his crushing repulse ; nor could Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	have found a more fortu - nate subject for the exercise of his powers of picturesque and dramatic description .

		The greater glamor of
Vicksburg	LOCATION	and
Gettysburg	LOCATION	has served to dim the real lustre of
Helena	LOCATION	; but this should not be allowed to mislead , at this distance of time , a careful observer of the moves on the chess-board of the
Mississippi Valley	LOCATION	.

		The biographical part of this history does not conform to our author 's usual standard of accuracy .

		He styles the same General
Prentiss	PERSON	, who entered the service from
Illinois	LOCATION	, a '' West Virginian Brigadier . ''

		He dismisses General
Albert Pike	PERSON	, of the
Confederate Army	ORGANIZATION	, with the appellation of '' an adventurer from
Massa	PERSON	- chusetts . ''

		But Pike was in no proper sense an adventurer , though born in
New England	LOCATION	, for he had lived longer in
Arkansas	LOCATION	than
General Blair	ORGANIZATION	, whom Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	idolizes , had lived in
Missouri	LOCATION	.

		Our author is apparently a good hater , as witness his treatment of General
Benjamin F. Butler	PERSON	.

		Though he does not style him '' an adventurer from
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, '' he adminis - ters to his memory a stinging excoriation for his acts as commander in
New Orleans	LOCATION	.

		Doubt - less these incidents in
Butler	PERSON	's career , and much other personal gossip such as abounds in this book , were introduced by the author to enliven and spice his lectures , in which form these chapters of history were first presented .

		They may add entertainment to a discourse which might otherwise prove dry and forbidding , and thus make more readable the details of marches and countermarches and skirmishes and bloody battles .

		This may have been the author 's intention .

		But we do not expect such outbreaks from the impartial historian .

		THE WORKING PEOPLE or
AMERICA	LOCATION	.

		* ``
America	LOCATION	's Working People '' forms the sub - ject of the second of Mr.
Charles B. Spahr	PERSON	's contributions to the sociological literature of the day ; and , like his '' Distribution of Wealth , '' the present work deserves the most careful attention .

		To the student of the modern novel , these researches into modern American life will show how impossible is it for one man to seek any adequate interpretation of that life at the present time , even should his work take the vast scope of another '' Comedie Humaine '' ; to the politician they will prove little or nothing ; but the statesman will find them compact with that true spirit of American manhood and de - mocracy which the politicians have been doing their best to prostitute by pensions , bounties , and special privileges of all sorts .

		To the plain citizen and patriot who loves
America	LOCATION	as he loves his mother , the book is one of hope and illumi - nation , especially worth reading by those whose residence in cities has given them an outlook upon the rest of their native land as if through smoked glass ; and , finally , all humane and con - scientious people will find here inducement to labor unceasingly and with good courage .

		Mr.
Spahr	PERSON	has gone the round of the
United States	LOCATION	in search of truth : unlike

		51 cynical he has found it .

		His journeys began with the older factory towns of
New England	LOCATION	; successively he took up the new factory towns in the
Southern States	LOCATION	, went to a country where the life is still that of the pioneer engaged in clearing away the primeval forests of Arkan - sas , made investigations concerning the negro both as workman and citizen which shed new light on a dark subject , dug into that still darker blot upon our civilization comprised in the coal mines and iron works of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, studied the trades-unions of
Chicago	LOCATION	with a perspicuity which led him nearer the truth than any other writer with whom we are familiar , talked and lived for a time with the Mormons of
Utah	LOCATION	, and learned much concerning a much misunderstood people , and concluded his wan - derings among the northern farms of
Minne	LOCATION	- sota and the
Dakotas	LOCATION	.

		In most places , but most of all among these northern farmers , Mr.
Spahr	PERSON	found the people free that is , he saw them to be Americans , unafraid of any man that walks the globe , sovereign citizens of the sort which bids the world wonder at a real de - mocracy of humanity .

		Here and there , as among the workmen in the
Chicago	LOCATION	building trades , he discovered an advocacy of freedom which is perilously near to lawlessness .

		Else - where , sporadically , he saw servility , the fawn - ing upon superiors which our fathers learned to despise generations ago as '' flunkeyism . ''

		Here is an example of this , quite as marked in its way as the heartbreaking failure of philan - thropy at Pullman in
1894	DATE	: '' All that I saw at Homestead convinced me that Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	was unusually sincere in his desire for the welfare of his employees .

		President
McKinley	PERSON	is not more so in his desire for the welfare of
Luzon	LOCATION	.

		But the fatal defect which Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	observes in the President 's policy in
the Philippines	LOCATION	permeates his own policy at Homestead .

		The government at Homestead aims to be government for the people , but its funda - mental principle is that there shall be no government by the people .

		He who joins an organization of the em - ployees at Homestead to resist the absolute supremacy of the employers is warned in advance that he can ac - complish nothing except his own ruin .

		The policy is not , indeed , that which Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	employed when he was directly in charge .

		In an unusual degree he sympathized with the organization of the men for self - government .

		But the imperialist policy in its most abso - lute lines is the one pursued and avowed by the present head of the Carnegie company , Mr.
Charles M. Schwab	PERSON	. ''

		Similar bits of illumination pervade the book , and no one can read it without the conviction that the issue really before the American peo - ple is that which Professor
William G. Sumner	PERSON	has so succinctly stated as '' the issue between plutocracy and democracy . ''

		A single regret remains after reading Mr.
Spahr	PERSON	's book through twice with the certainty of taking it up for more than one re-reading : he did not dig out the truth of the iniquity in the
Coaur d'Alene	ORGANIZATION	region in
Idaho	LOCATION	, a spot on the continent , not in the islands , where imperialism and militarism are reigning unmodified and unchecked .


JOHN J. HOLDEN	PERSON	.

		THE EMPIRE OF THE MOORS .

		* The northwest corner of the continent of
Africa	LOCATION	is practically an unknown country even to the educated reader on this side of the sea .

		This Moorish sultanate borders on the Medi - terranean and the
Atlantic	LOCATION	, and on
Algeria	LOCATION	and the
Sahara	LOCATION	.

		It embraces about 220,000 square miles .

		Its rulers and people have played a tragical role in the world 's history for more than a thousand years .

		Mr.
Meakin	PERSON	's '' Historical Epitome of the Moorish Empire '' is the first of a series of three volumes on this land and people .

		The bibliography of this vast empire has already passed far beyond two .

		thousand titles .

		But there has been no modern work in English that brings the history down to the present date .

		The present volume epitomizes the history of the empire ; the second , already announced , will give a comprehensive description of '' The Land of the Moors '' ; and the third will be a comprehensive description of the
Moors	ORGANIZATION	.

		The portly volume before us is broken into three parts , dealing with internal development , external relations , and Moroccan literature , with an appendix on '' classical authorities on
Morocco	LOCATION	. ''

		The first part is a rapid sketch of history from 500 B. C. down to
1894	DATE
A. D	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is so sketchy , now and then , as to presup - pose more information than most of its readers possess .

		But its narrative rather than statis - tical style holds and carries along the mind of the reader with an ever-increasing interest .

		The author fortifies his pithy statements by ample references to the chief authorities on Moorish history .

		This feature of the work assures the reader that the author is not pre - suming on his good faith , but is ready to give him for his own verification the basis of his assertions .

		To aid in a proper conception of the history of the empire , the book is supplied with a comparative chart , which presents to * THE MOORISH EMPIRE : A Historical Epitome .

		62 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, the eye , in a length of about one yard , its his - torical , chronological , geographical , and geneo - logical relations and features .

		This , with smaller charts and illustrations in abundance , affords a very definite idea of the vicissitudes of that strange and often dreadful empire .

		There is no part of that long stretch of his - tory that exceeds for grim savagery and tyran - nical villainy the career of Mulai Ismail , whose long reign covered a period of fifty-five years , -LRB- 1672-1727 -RRB- .

		The author so condenses his administration -LRB- pp. 139-161 -RRB- that the horrible details of his barbarity must be omitted .

		The beginning of his reign is described thus : '' In announcing this -LSB- the determination to make Mequinez his capital -RSB- he sent ten thousand heads , includ - ing those of women and children slain in his rival 's camp , to adorn the walls of
Fez	LOCATION	and
Marr	PERSON	& kesh , while he caused the bodies of prisoners of war to be inter - woven with rushes to form a bridge whereby the vic - torious army might cross a river .

		Thus commenced the horrors of that awful reign . ''


Chenier	PERSON	, in describing his perfidious career , says : '' Active , enterprising , and politic , this emperor tar - nished the glory of his reign by avarice , duplicity , oppression , injustice , and continuous barbarities , the relation of which would be dreadful , and the remem - brance of which time only can efface ... Nero ,
Caligula	LOCATION	, Heliogabalus were abhorent villains ; yet Nero ,
Caligula	LOCATION	, Heliogabalus themselves were unequal to the fiend of whose acts I give -LSB- in earlier chapters -RSB- but a partial account . ''

		His mastery of the situation and his moulding influence in crystallizing the character of the empire were such that our author adds : `` With - out an understanding of the
Moorish Empire	ORGANIZATION	as Ismail left it , it would be impossible to un - derstand
Morocco	LOCATION	as it is . ''

		After drawing a lurid picture of the excesses and oppressions of the present administration of
Morocco	LOCATION	, we discover a ray of sunlight in the following -LRB- p. 225 -RRB- : '' The only satisfactory officials in
Morocco	LOCATION	, as a rule , are those who have been drawn from the ranks of re - tired men of business men whose palms no longer itch whose knowledge of the world enables them to act with dignity and fairness , and whose intercourse with Europeans has removed their prejudices to a great extent .

		The Moorish method is to select from among such men those whose reputation is high , to appoint them as administrators of customs , of whom there are several at every port ... For foreign payments these administrators serve as
Moorish Government	ORGANIZATION	bankers , on whom orders are given at court , and altogether they play a part not unlike , though far behind , that played by the excellent service under the inspector-general of Chinese imperial customs . ''

		The external relations of the Empire are de - picted in strong terms .

		Beginning with
1246	DATE	A.D. , the author traces with sufficient fulness the part which Europeans and others have taken and suffered in their relations with the
Moors	ORGANIZATION	.

		The horrors perpetrated , particularly on Christian slaves , by the above-mentioned
Mulai Ismail	PERSON	are indescribable and blood-curd - ling .

		The only check to Moorish barbarity toward foreigners lay in their fear of European powers .

		This , with other influences , has some - what modified and promoted their foreign re - lations .

		Foreign enlightenment has compelled His Majesty to regard to some extent the wishes of his subjects .

		Foreign powers have also set some limits to his absolute freedom .

		So that our author speaks of '' that decrepit Power which now , by courtesy alone , retains the name of * the
Moorish Empire	ORGANIZATION	, ' ... a ghastly travesty of empire . ''


France	LOCATION	, beyond all other nations , is said to be casting longing eyes toward this territory , as an important section of her projected African empire .

		The author has done good service for stu - dents of history in general and of
Morocco	LOCATION	in particular by his 110 pages of discussion of the best literature on
Morocco	LOCATION	.

		A part of the ma - terial is in the form of reviews of books and pamphlets by the best writers .

		If the works announced shall come up to the standard here laid down , modern students of ethnology , his - tory , and geography will have a valuable con - tribution to their apparatus .

		ETHNOGRAPHIC ALBUM OF MEXICAN INDIANS .

		* The opportunity to go among barbarous peoples is given to but few .

		Nor are there many who have the enthusiasm or the interest to create such opportunity .

		There are no well - defined tourist routes to the homes of the un - civilized , nor carefully planned accommodations for the traveller in those regions .

		He must take his host as he finds him , but usually he can be assured that his reception will not be unkindly nor his hospitality stinted .

		Though so few really know the uncivilized man at home , almost everyone finds him inter - esting as a curiosity , and an increasing number are coming to learn more and more from him by serious study .

		So to almost everyone an ethnographic album , such as Professor

		53 among books , and as an object of great interest .

		It is entertaining to see how other people do things ; it is of value to the student to be able to make a comparative study of the mode of life , dress , customs , and physical features of other people than ourselves .

		There are few places in the world where the mixture of tribes and languages is more con - fused than in
Southern Mexico	LOCATION	and
Central America	LOCATION	.

		An interesting problem is here pre - sented to the student of ethnology , to account for this confusion .

		Is it due to a mixture of many radically distinct tribes ?

		or are these but variations of a few stocks now so far apart that little connection between them can be de - tected ?

		In the absence of all historic data , the answer to such a question is to be found in a study of the customs and physical features of the people themselves .

		This is the work which Professor
Starr	PERSON	has been carrying on for some years .

		He has made many visits to
Mexico	LOCATION	, accompanied by a photographer , and has visited those least known , least accessible , and most interesting parts of the Mexican Republic .

		One result of this work appears in his album illus - trating the Indians of
Southern Mexico	LOCATION	.

		Ethnographic albums have been issued be - fore ; but rarely if ever have they been satis - factory , partly because of a lack of material to make a good album and partly because the work of reproduction has been poorly done .

		Professor
Starr	PERSON	, in a series of 141 plates re - produced from photographs selected from many hundreds , gives an idea of the general appear - ance of the people of thirteen tribes , of their villages , homes , and occupations .

		The work of reproduction is excellent : almost none of the sharpness of outline and definiteness of detail of the original photographs is lost .

		Thirty-two pages of text are included to explain the plates .

		This publication will soon be followed by a paper by Professor
Starr	PERSON	, descriptive of the daily life and industries of the people illus - trated in the album , which will add greatly to the interest and value of the present work .


MERTON L. MILLER	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		In such a series as that of '' Heroes of .

		the Nations '' -LRB- Ptnam -RRB- , a life of
Oliver Cromwell	PERSON	was pretty sure to appear sooner or later : so it is perhaps a mere coin - cidence that Mr.
Charles Firth	PERSON	's ''
Oliver Cromwell	PERSON	and the Rule of the Puritans in
England	LOCATION	'' should be given to the public at the same time with Mr.
Morley	PERSON	's narrative in '' The Century '' and that of Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	in '' Scribner 's . ''

		Careful readers and interested students will peruse all three of these , and will understand something of the fascination which the life and work of the Protector have exer - cised on such widely variant natures as
Carlyle	LOCATION	and
Gardiner	PERSON	and
Morley	PERSON	and
Firth	PERSON	in
England	LOCATION	, and
Roosevelt	PERSON	and
S. H. Church	ORGANIZATION	in
America	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Charles Firth	PERSON	is not a genius like
Carlyle	PERSON	, nor a lit - erary master like
John Morley	PERSON	; but in all matters where patient research and a real instinct for get - ting at the truth are involved , he is an authority whom other writers are glad to quote .

		The book before us is an expansion of Mr.
Firth	PERSON	's article in the '' Dictionary of
National Biography	ORGANIZATION	, '' written in
1888	DATE	; but it embodies the results of later researches and of recently discovered documents .

		The narra - tive is an abridged but adequate account of the great events which made epical the twenty years between
1640	DATE	and
1660	DATE	.

		Mr.
Firth	PERSON	's estimate of Crom - well 's character is candid , tinged though it be with sympathetic admiration .

		The summary of his work which forms the concluding paragraph is worth quoting : ''
Cromwell	PERSON	remained throughout his life too much the champion of a party to be accepted as a national hero by later generations , but in serving his Cause he served his Country too .

		No English ruler did more to shape the future of the land he governed , none showed more clearly in his acts the - plain heroic magnitude of mind . ' ''

		The book is unusually rich in illustrations over forty of them , seven being portraits -LRB- of one kind or another -RRB- of
Cromwell	LOCATION	.

		There are seven maps , prepared by Mr.
B. V. Darbishire	PERSON	under Mr.
Firth	PERSON	's direction , to illustrate important campaigns or battles .

		Two of these `` differ considerably '' -LRB- as the author says in his preface -RRB- '' from those generally accepted as correct . ''

		It may be added that Mr.
Morley	PERSON	, in his account of
Marston Moor	ORGANIZATION	, accepts Mr.
Firth	PERSON	's plan as the most trustworthy .

		In the plan to illustrate the battle of Naseby -LRB- to face p. 128 -RRB- the draughts - man seems inadvertently to have confused the posi - tions of `` Parliamentarians '' and `` Royalists '' by misplacing the devices employed to indicate the respective armies .

		The book will take its place in Cromwellian literature as a clear , impartial , and authoritative presentment of one of the most fruitful epochs in the history of self-government , and of the all-compelling man who was its central figure .

		Lovers of
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	find the life of the man as interest - ing as his books ; and Mr.
L. Cope Cornford	PERSON	, in his volume of biography and criticism of
Stevenson	PERSON	-LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , has made a very engaging sketch of an attractive personality .

		In his preface , the author disclaims any attempt to write the full story of
Stevenson	PERSON	's life , satisfying himself with a `` study of his finished achievement , and of his personality and temperament as expressed in that achievement '' ; and this study he has made with fine sympathy and careful critical discrimina -
Stevensori	PERSON	's romantic life .

		THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, tion .

		Discussing
Stevenson	PERSON	's philosophy in the chapter on '' The Moralist , '' he finds courage the last word of that philosophy ; hut somehow through it all is '' the want of some kindly , indefinable , hu - man quality , '' and he deepens our impression that
Stevenson	PERSON	was one who , by reason of his courage , played a little too lightly and buoyantly over the surface of things .

		For a time , perhaps , in our de - light in his romancing , we were inclined to glorify
Stevenson	PERSON	beyond the warrant of his work ; and it is therefore all the more pleasant to find Mr.
Corn	PERSON	- ford 's appreciation balanced by so sane a judgment .

		In conclusion he says : '' But with all
Stevenson	PERSON	's brilliant endowment and all his amazing cleverness , the sane , serenely humorous vision of the great masters is denied him . ''

		What those brilliant en - dowments were , he sets before us with a very pleas - ing literary art of his own .

		In the chapters on `` The Romanticist , '' `` The Novelist , '' and `` The Limner of Landscape , '' he discusses with surprising fulness -LRB- since the chapters are not long -RRB- the dis - tinctive characteristics of
Stevenson	PERSON	's work , and his limitations .

		The wonderful versatility of the man is the most striking thing in the impression which these chapters make , and the range of his achieve - ment comes up pretty clearly in this account of it .

		Something of the color that vibrates in the pages of '' The Master of
Ballantrae	LOCATION	'' or '' The Wrecker '' has found place in the book .

		Though a volume of but two hundred pages , it contains about as much as the ordinary reader will care to know about
Stevenson	PERSON	, and no reader will think it a word too long .

		It has been remarked , by Mr.
Her	PERSON	- carVS ^ Ln .

		bert S P 6DCer and .

		Other8 > that spend our youth in learning every sort of thing except the supremely important one that of taking care of the coming generation .

		Prob - ably no parent has entered into the joys of parent - hood prospectively without an earnest search through the literature of the day to find some book that will set forth the rule of conduct in such case made and provided at least no parent who is ac - customed to go to books for information .

		For the most part , such a quest has been vain ; all the in - telligence which school and college has sharpened into acuteness stands dulled before the immutable and mysterious facts of nature ; and we boasting moderns take up our duties as fathers and mothers in the same tentative , empirical , impractical way that befalls all mankind after it leaves the safe har - bor of savagery and invincible ignorance .

		False modesty , what White called `` prurient prudery , '' the hypocrisy of Anglo-Saxonry , and the lack of real civilization , combine to keep us from our duty and our rightful inheritance .

		In this emergency , Dr.
Nathan Oppenheim	PERSON	steps forward for the third time with '' The Care of the Child in Health '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and with courage enough to begin his suggestions for the care of the child when the child 's life begins , and not after it is too late for the mother to avail herself of some simple direc - tions which will add greatly to her peace of mind and to the future happiness of the child itself .

		The book is not filled with veiled suggestions which will serve to keep it under lock and key to become a fearful joy to the youngster who chances upon it later ; rather is it a book of facts to be kept where all the family can read it and do what they can to make amends for the lack which Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	has observed in us .

		Though the latest in point of time of Dr.
Oppenheim	PERSON	's excellent treatises , it precedes them in the facts discussed , and serves as a scien - tific introduction to them as to the facts of parent - hood .

		Hard realities Mr -
Karl Irvin	PERSON	g Faust 's rather elab - of warfare in orately gotten up volume entitled the
Philippines	LOCATION	.

		Campaigning in
the Philippines	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Hicks-Judd Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
San Francisco	LOCATION	-RRB- is frankly a com - pilation , by no means altogether of stale matter however , and the fact that its contents are largely from the pens of men who were active participants in the events described lends it a certain interest .

		The graphic quality of the book is enhanced by the numerous illustrations after photographic snap-shots taken largely at the scene of action , and in some instances under conditions arduous enough , one would think , to baffle the ingenuity or cool the courage of the most enterprising '' camera fiend . ''

		Let us add that the ghastly objects shown in some of these plates the trenches choked with corpses , and courtyards covered with mangled trunks and torn disjecta membra , and so on , should suffice to chill the martial ardor of the most strenuous .

		The compiler of the volume went out to
Manila	LOCATION	in
December , 1898	DATE	, to collect data for an account of the military operations then thought to be virtually over .

		Arriving at
Manila	LOCATION	on the eve of the out - break of the trouble with our late allies , Mr.
Faust	PERSON	saw that the scope of the projected book must be enlarged , so as to include accounts of the new cam - paigns then evidently impending .

		A staff of writers was therefore organized to follow up the move - ments of the troops in the field , and the cooperation of competent men in the various regiments was ar - ranged for .

		The result of this enterprise is a melange of descriptive and statistical matter that undoubtedly contains a fair amount of the raw ma - terial of history proper .

		The editor has evidently tried to get at the truth as far as possible , as well as to make a readable and salable book .

		A supple - mentary chapter sketches the history of the
Philip	LOCATION	- pines and their people , and there are some useful maps .

		The lack of an index seriously impairs its value as a book of reference .

		Mr.
Edmund Hamilton Sears	PERSON	's '' Outline of Political Growth in the Nineteenth Century '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is not very happily named : it might better have been called an '' Outline of Political History , '' or something of that sort .

		The author explains , in his preface , that he wished to emphasize the growth The growth of modern democracy .

		1900 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 55 of popular institutions , which he has done ; but the words '' political growth '' do not necessarily con - vey this idea .

		From this point of view , he should have called his work an `` Outline of Democratic Growth '' or of the '' Growth of Democracy . ''

		The conception of the work is a good one , and its execu - tion is in some particulars meritorious .

		The book shows reading , if not original investigation which , however , is not claimed but disclaimed ; and the arrangement and handling of the material show grasp of the subject .

		A very large amount of use - ful information relating to an important topic is brought into convenient compass .

		But , we regret to say , this information can not always be implicitly accepted .

		For example , in dealing with the Home Rule controversy in
England	LOCATION	, the author makes all Home Rulers Irishmen , thus confounding them with the Irish Nationalists ; while he says Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	's retirement from office and public life was `` owing to the formation of a cataract in his eyes . ''

		The ten-line personal sketch of President
Garfield	PERSON	contains two positive errors .


Garfield	PERSON	did not , as asserted , '' abandon the law to serve , first in the army , and afterwards in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	'' ; neither was he , at the time of his nomination for the Presi - dency , serving in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	.

		Garfield 's law prac - tice all followed his entry into
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and he never served in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	at all , although he was chosen a member of that body the winter before he was elected President .

		A - wheel in
Normandy	LOCATION	.

		Tourists who know
Normandy	LOCATION	only through its fashionable watering - places and its one or two larger his - toric towns will find Mr.
Percy Dearmer	PERSON	's valuable little book , `` Highways and Byways in
Normandy	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , in its way a revelation .

		Mr.
Dear	PERSON	- mer 's scholarly descriptions are copiously illustrated by the delightful drawings of Mr.
Joseph Pennell	PERSON	, whose pencil is very much at home in depicting the picturesque nooks and corners and unspoiled archi - tectural charms of the quaint old Norman towns .

		For those who desire to explore and to know Nor - mandy , to get away from the beaten track of the '' personally conducted '' tourist , this is assuredly the book .

		Not that Mr.
Dearmer	PERSON	has by any means exhausted the riches of this lovely corner of
France	LOCATION	.

		His trip was made a-wheel , and he cheerfully ad - mits that '' it would be easy to leave the route that is here suggested at almost any point and discover fresh country . ''

		In Mr.
Dearmer	PERSON	's narrative , if such it can properly be called , the personal note is not conspicuous , the space being devoted mainly to objective description of the country passed through .

		Much desirable information as to the historic asso - ciations and past of notable towns and buildings is interspersed .

		There is a folding map showing the author 's route , and Mr.
Pennell	PERSON	's very tasteful drawings serve to illustrate as well as adorn this capital descriptive and historical guide to the tempt - ing region explored by Mr.
Dearmer	PERSON	.

		Recollections of Presidential
Colonel A. K. McClure	PERSON	is a veteran of American politics .

		He has ac - ^ y ^ participated in fourteen Presi - dential contests , or nearly half of the entire number .

		In the
Republican National Convention	ORGANIZATION	of
1860	DATE	he played a prominent part , leading , with Mr.
Curtin	PERSON	, the '' break '' of his delegation from
Cameron	LOCATION	to
Lincoln	LOCATION	.

		In the ensuing campaign he was chair - man of the
State Committee	ORGANIZATION	.

		In addition to his experience ,
Colonel McClure	PERSON	has made a life-long study of the history and methods of American poli - tics , especially of the great quadrennial contests for the Presidency .

		He now embodies the information thus gained in ' a volume of some 400 pages , entitled `` Our Presidents and How We Make Them '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , which aims to narrate succinctly yet readably the story of each Presidential campaign , down to and inclusive of that of
1896	DATE	.

		Upon the inside history of those campaigns in which
Colonel McClure	ORGANIZATION	personally took part some interesting side - lights are shed .

		The text is brightened with an occasional anecdote .

		The book is , all things con - sidered , commendably impartial , and contains much information of the sort that an active political ex - perience can best supply .

		There are twenty-five portraits , including one of the author .

		Dr.
E. E. Hale	PERSON	on
Emerson	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
Edward Everett Hale	PERSON	writing of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	could hardly fail to be interesting , and though his book is not very thick , containing only an address of some fifty-three pages by the author and two early essays of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's , the address itself , is pure gold and the essays are more than interesting .

		Little per - sonal touches that bring us near to the warm human nature of the transcendental philosopher crop out on every page , and his figure grows larger for us as we realize more fully the range of his sympathies .

		It is refreshing to read accounts of his efforts to hold the Town and
Country Club	ORGANIZATION	to practical aims , and equally so to read of his getting up in the dim midnight to soothe and comfort two lonely boys , like himself guests in a strange house . ''

		He was what his own
New England	LOCATION	had made him .

		And this was a child of God who chose to go to God for instructions ... And no interpretation of that word by any of these aides brothers and sisters of his could turn him from the Father .

		This is the secret of the power of Emerson . ''

		Slight as it is , all lovers of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	will want the book , with its revealings of the inner spirit of the loftiest figure in American letters .

Gargantua	LOCATION	and A three-volume reprint of Rabelais , Pantagruel in in Sir
Thomas Urquhart	PERSON	's seven - a new dress .

		teenth-century English , forms the latest issue in the admirable series of '' Tudor Translations '' published by Mr.
David Nutt	PERSON	of
London	LOCATION	.

		The edition is edited by Mr.
Charles Whibley	PERSON	, whose introductory essay of nearly a hun - dred pages contains all the information , biograph - THE DIAL , -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, ical and critical , essential to a right understanding of Rabelais and his work .

		Sir
Thomas Urquhart	PERSON	's rendering of the immortal tales of Gargantua and
Pantagruel	LOCATION	, first issued in
1653	DATE	, occupies a posi - tion immeasurably above any other English version .

		It is , as Mr.
Whibley	PERSON	says , '' a translation , unique in its kind , which has no rival in profane letters .

		Indeed it can scarcely be called a translation at all ; rather it is the English Rabelais ... He -LSB- Urqu - hart -RSB- was , in a sense , Rabelais incarnate . ''

		The mechanical form of this new edition is in keeping with previous volumes of the ''
Tudor Transla	PERSON	- tions , '' that is to say , the volumes are models of typographical dignity and excellence : It is certain that
Rabelais	PERSON	was never before presented to English readers in so satisfactory and attractive a form .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		In ''
Paris	LOCATION	As It Is '' -LRB-
Doubleday , Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB-
Miss Katherine de Forest	ORGANIZATION	has given us a very readable book , which , in spite of the disclaimer of its preface , will convey a good deal of information to the average reader and probably contribute in its way something toward a better appreciation of French life .

		Her account of what she has seen is sprightly and enlivened with anecdotes not always new but generally good .

		When she drops into philosophy of art or literature she shows to less advantage .

		Her ambition to '' interpret the genius of
Paris	LOCATION	'' must not lead one to expect anything that may be compared with the chapters of Mr.
Hamerton	PERSON	or Mr.
Browuell	PERSON	.

		There are some excellent pictures , and the book is neatly printed and bound .

		Unfortunately , the proof-reading is atrocious .

		The foreign names and phrases which liberally besprinkle the pages appear under horrible disguises ; the blunders here are some - times of a character to make us suspect the complicity of the author .

		The latest '' Temple Classics '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- to reach us form a group of exceptionally attractive titles in a series which is uniformly attractive .

		They comprise a two-volume edition of
Goldsmith	PERSON	's '' A Citizen of the World , '' with notes by Mr.

		I. and II .

		in a seven-volume edition of

CONTINENTAL	ORGANIZATION	LITERATURE .

		i .

		In pursuance of our custom of several years ' standing , we have summarized for this and the succeeding issue of THE DIAL the reports made to the
London	LOCATION	'' Athenaeum '' by the foreign correspondents of that journal , upon the liter - ary history of the last twelvemonth in the sev - eral countries of
Continental Europe	ORGANIZATION	.

		Our acknowledgments are once more due to our English contemporary for the material herewith presented .

		The reports for the present year include twelve countries , the only noticeable omissions being
Greece	LOCATION	,
Portugal	LOCATION	, and
Sweden	LOCATION	.

		We present our summary by countries , in alphabetical order , following the example set by the '' Athenaeum . ''

		Professor
Paul Fredericq	PERSON	writes of
Belgium	LOCATION	, and begins with mention of E. Banning ' * posthumous ''
Reflexions Morales	PERSON	et Poli - tiques . ''

		The author was a diplomat and a student of political science , not unlike
Laveleye	PERSON	in the range of his interests . ''

		The French poets and prose authors of
Belgium	LOCATION	who enjoy a reputation outside their country are becom - ing naturalized in
France	LOCATION	in increasing numbers .

		MM .

		Maeterlinck ,
Camille Lemonnier	PERSON	,
Eeckhoud	LOCATION	, and
Roden	PERSON	- bach the last died at
Paris	LOCATION	last year have even settled in the French capital , which now sends forth their books instead of Ghent or
Brussels	LOCATION	or
Antwerp	LOCATION	.


M. Lemonnier	PERSON	has published two novels , '
Une Femme	PERSON	' and ` Au Co3ur Frais de la ForeV ;
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	continues his series of philosophical compositions with ' Le
Mystere de la Justice	ORGANIZATION	. '

		A collection of
Roden	PERSON	- bach 's work has appeared under the title of ' L'Elite , ' containing the portraits of the authors and artists of the day whom he considered the best . ''

		In
Belgium	LOCATION	, we are told , '' the theatre lives almost entirely on pieces from
France	LOCATION	. ''

		There are , however , a few Belgian pieces , the most important of them being '' Le Cloitre , '' by
M. Verhaeren	PERSON	.

		A work of timely interest is the '' Pays des Boers '' of
M. Leclercq	PERSON	, who visited
South Africa	LOCATION	just before the war .

		In their `` Controverse Transvaalienne , '' MM .

		Abel and
Christophe	PERSON	`` have gathered the arguments for both sides as they appear to Belgians , '' where the
Boers	PERSON	are generally favored by public opinion .

		M.
Henri Pirenne	PERSON	's '' Histoire de Belgique , '' now published in French , has made 66 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, a considerable sensation , although it has not got beyond the fourteenth century .

		There are many other contributions to national history besides this .

		In Flemish literature nothing very remarkable seems to have been published , unless we except ''
Te Lande	PERSON	, '' a volume of sketches by Mr.
Cyriel Buysse	PERSON	. ''

		Flemish literature , which began by being at first merely popular and poetical , is gradually becoming learned .

		The professors of our universities are begin - ning to write their books in their mother tongue ... The Flemish even dream of forming at Ghent a uni - versity of their own , like the
Slav University	ORGANIZATION	the Czechs of
Bohemia	LOCATION	have had for some years at
Prague	LOCATION	.

		What - ever comes of the scheme , no one can deny that the level of Flemish literature is gradually but surely rising year by year . ''

		Finally , mention is made of two small works interesting to English scholars '' The En - glish Faust-Book of
1592	DATE	, '' edited by Professor Logeman ; and '' Was Dachte Shakespeare iiber Poesie ? ''

		by
M. Paul Hamelius	PERSON	.

		Mr.
V. Tille	PERSON	, writing of
Bohemia	LOCATION	, begins by saying : '' In all branches of mental activity ,
Bohemia	LOCATION	is mak - ing fresh starts , energetic attempts at novel forms and developments .

		The older generation is passing away , people who in their day have done their duty in different departments of science and literature ; but we are still waiting for a man capable of shaping something new out of the chaos of modern tendencies .

		For this reason also , the majority of our authors ' tendencies are char - acterized by general rather than by individual quali - ties , and only very few books rise above the average level . ''

		In serious writing , mention is made of some works on the development of civilization and of art , besides studies in literary criticism , such as Mr.
Vrchlicky	PERSON	's '' Chapters on Recent French Fiction , '' and Mr.
Vlcek	PERSON	's '' History of Our Poetry . ''

		But in general , '' literary criticism shows a great lack of depth and elaboration , yet at the same time plenty of cursory studies and interesting struggles between the several tendencies of our younger writers .

		A large systematic work on the history of universal literature is in preparation , but as yet nothing can be said about its execution . ''

		Literature proper is summarized in a few such sentences as the following : '' The older authors who have already secured hon - ourable places in the history of our literature remain quiet , and are mostly occupied in publishing collections of their own works .

		... A kind of fiction cultivated in
Bohemia	LOCATION	with uncommon predilection is the tale of popular life , embracing scenes from the life of Bohe - mian peasantry , directly drawn from different parts of the country ... Dramatic literature is now on the eve of a new era caused by the change in the working of the national theatre in
Prague	LOCATION	.

		The management passes this year into the hands of a new society consist - ing of the foremost men in the literary and financial world . ''

		The plays which have made the most stir have been Mr.
Svoboda	PERSON	's '' Passion Flowers '' and '' The Uprooted Oak , '' and Mr.
Hilbert	PERSON	's '' The Exiles , '' which has been published but not yet produced .

		The report from
Denmark	LOCATION	is contributed by Dr.
Alfred Ipsen	PERSON	, who says , among other things , that a new collected edition of Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	has just been published ; that Profes - sor
Hansen	PERSON	is bringing out a second edition of his monumental `` History of Danish Litera - ture '' ; that
Herr Julius Clausen	PERSON	is editing a literary history of the world on a plan similar to that of the English series in charge of Pro- fessor
Gosse	PERSON	; and that a large new '' History of the Danish Kingdom , '' by many hands , is now in course of publication .


Herr Drach	PERSON	- mann 's '' Hellige lid '' -LRB- Sacred Fire -RRB- , written during his American sojourn , is probably the most noteworthy literary production of the year . ''

		Carit Etlar , '' not long before his death , published a story of old-time
Norway	LOCATION	entitled '' Bjorneset , '' highly romantic in color - ing and treatment .


Herr Skjoldborg	PERSON	's ''
Krage	PERSON	- huset '' '' presents a picture of peasant life on the western coast of
Jutland	LOCATION	.

		He knows the peasants there as scarcely any other man does , being himself settled among them as a teacher . ''

		Other works of fiction are '' Lykke-Peer , '' by
Herr Pontoppidan	PERSON	, which is largely autobio - graphical ; '' The Sins of the People , '' by Mr.
Gyrithe Lemche	PERSON	, which treats of a delicate subject , but not with sensational intent ; and '' Before the Portal of Death , '' by
Herr Ed	PERSON	- vard
Egeberg	PERSON	, '' a most serious and momentous effort . ''

		In verse ,
Herr E. Blaumuller	PERSON	, a cler - gyman , has published a volume '' in which a whole cycle of songs is devoted to Spinoza . '' ''

		I must first consider various theatrical pieces of the year , '' says
M. Jules Pravieux	PERSON	, writing of French literature . ''

		We are tired , quite tired , of the brutal or bitter or immoral sort of piece .

		This style has become dreadfully commonplace .

		To do realism justice , it has rendered a real service to letters : it has done away with the cult of the vaudeville , which has had so many faithful fol - lowers since Scribe was its chief prophet .

		We have learnt to despise ingenious combinations , elaborate im - broglios .

		People have , it appears , an increasing fond - ness for ideas at the theatre ideas belonging to psychology , morals , philosophy , sociology .

		I will not go so far as to say that the French theatre is confined to idealism .

		The statement would be untrue , and this chronicle of the chief pieces will have to notice attempts of quite a different sort . ''

		1900 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 67 '' Les
Maris de Leontine	PERSON	, '' by
M. Capus	PERSON	, and Le
Pere Naturel	PERSON	, '' by MM .

		Dupre and
Char	PERSON	- ton , are pieces in the style of refined vaude - ville , but they stand out as rather exceptional .

		A few problem plays are briefly characterized .

		M. Bruyere , in the piece called '' En Paix , '' '' attacks the law on the confinement of the insane , '' but makes of his theme '' a deep-dyed melodrama . ''

		`` M. Jacques Normand leads us to calmer regions .

		The problem he has intended to study in ' La Douceur de Croire ' is this : Have you the right to destroy faith if you have nothing to put in its place ?

		Reasoning is powerless to resolve problems whose essential elements are beyond reason ... M. Brieux in ' La Robe Rouge ' proves once more his lively gifts .

		He has exhibited in some scenes of real power the distortions of soul in a magistrate due to the professional spirit .

		M. Brieux in all his pieces puts before one the most pressing social and moral problems of the day with a keen sense of life , and his boldness is almost always crowned with success .

		He despises the common proceedings by which authors in vogue capture the applause of the gallery ...
M. Hermant	PERSON	also looks out for ' actual ' subjects .

		He has given us ' L'Empreinte ' and ' Le Faubourg . '

		The first can be without hesitation reck - oned a ' piece a these . ' '

		L'Empreinte ' belongs to the daily increasing list of pieces against divorce .

		If one wished to be ironical , it would be pleasant to observe how the dramatists , after having advertised divorce , now seem to exert a keenness in fighting against it as great as the energy , audacity , and enthusiasm with which they celebrated its benefits ... Since the extra - ordinary success of ' Cyrano , ' a passionate curiosity fol - lows the works of
M. Rostand	PERSON	.

		In '
L'Aiglon	PERSON	' he has resolutely left fiction alone , and the methods of Dumas the elder and
Victor Hugo	PERSON	.

		His idea is , in a series of well-chosen scenes , to bring out the real figure of the son of
Napoleon	LOCATION	.

		He has made up for the absence of incident by a strong precise psychological analysis , thus imitating the great classics .


M. Rostand	PERSON	has written an unequal , but splendid work , full of pathetic beauty , with a breath , at times , of
Victor Hugo	PERSON	's epic genius .

		If he sins in any direction , it is in excessive facility , in the over-use of comparison and metaphor . ''

		`` The tendencies of the poets are not very clearly defined , '' we are told . ''

		Their common aim seems to be to put ideas into poetry , but broad ideas which are the expression of the most intimate personality , which render the deep vibra - tions resulting from being in contact with things and faced by the great enigma of life .

		The evolution of versification is going on .

		The romantic reform is being completed by the banishment of the last traces of caesura of the hemistich in the verses which are not ex - pressly formed on the classical type .

		The aim is to make verse still more supple , and capable of finer , more clearly expressive , harmonies . ''

		The most noteworthy volumes of recent poetry are '' La Beaute de Vivre , '' by
M. Fernand Gregh	PERSON	; `` Les Medailles d'Argile , '' by
M. Henri de Regnier	PERSON	; `` Berthe aux Longs Pieds , '' by
M. Andre Rivoire	PERSON	; '' La
Legende Ailee de Wieland	PERSON	le Forgeron , '' by
M. Viele Griffin	PERSON	; '' Fleurs de
Corail	LOCATION	, '' by
M. Maurice Olivaint	PERSON	; '' Fleurs d'Hiver , '' by
M. Armand Silvestre	PERSON	; '' Au Champs et au Foyer , '' by
M. Achille Million	PERSON	; '' La Bretagne Enchantee , '' by
M. Paul Sebillot	PERSON	; and '' La Charmille d'Or , '' by
M. A. Joubert	PERSON	. ''

		Our century is so infatuated with the novel that it is not strange to see novelists multiplying at a rate really frightful ... One fact is evident , for every year brings fresh proof of it : there is no school , a fact which can not be regretted .

		Every one goes his own way follows his ideal , his own bent , as he chooses .

		Every one is innovating or imitating as his innate tem - perament or his lively affection directs . ''

		M. Bourget is becoming a moralist rather than a psychologist .

		`` The time has come when simple undiluted state - ments of fact do not satisfy him .

		The study of the human heart leaves an uneasiness , and as by living near the sick one gets the desire to care for them , the psy - chologist is being moved with pity for the poor suffering souls whose wounds he examined at first with mere cu - riosity .

		Having seen souls suffer , he attempts to cure them with beliefs . ''

		These statements are illustrated by
M. Bour	PERSON	- get 's `` Drames de Famille . '' ''

		Nor do the brothers
Margueritte	PERSON	, in their novel < Femmes Nouvelles , ' aim at merely amusing their readers .

		They wish to oblige them to verify , and cor - rect some of the gravest errors , some of the worst in - justices , of our contemporary civilization .

		So their book , before being a work of art , is a social work . ''

		M. Barres , in '' L'Appel au Soldat , '' has con - tinued the theme of his '' Deracines . ''

		M. Rod 's latest novel , '' Au Milieu du Chemin , '' studies '' the important question of the respon - sibility of the man of letters .

		The book de - rives a great beauty from the gravity of the subject alone , but the novel spoils the moral treatment . ''

		M.
Marcel Prevost	PERSON	, in ''
Freder	PERSON	- ique '' and ''
Lea	PERSON	, '' has attacked the '' question feministe '' '' his characters are thrown into strong relief by his dramatic power , and their experiences are vividly related . ''

		Of
M. Zola	PERSON	's '' Fecondite '' we are told that '' One can not help admiring the extraordinary powers of his imagination , the gift he has of creating great wholes , of painting crowds of stirring people all alive , thrilled , carried away by great movements , roused by great agita - tions to revolt .

		His novel is a poem , a highly realistic poem .

		Its descriptions are intense , brilliant , winding off into visions .

		It moves towards the organization of a vast allegory , disengaging more or less confusedly a social con - ception whose chief merit is not originality .

		The novel of
M. Zola	ORGANIZATION	gives me a chance to note once more that the realist school , of which he is the chief , has seen its day .

		The preferences of young men entering letters are not for the literary doctrines of

		This year has also seen the appearance of the first volume of a long-awaited life of
Louis Veuillot	PERSON	, by his brother . ''

		At the end of this review the leading idea to be discovered in the literary effort of the year might be a subject for inquiry .

		Tendencies are confused , and the result of all this agitation and preparation of all sorts may be asked .

		If I can trust an eminent critic and authority , it is now all over with scientific literature , only an artistic literature can be produced .

		To-day it is all over with naturalism , as it was forty years ago with romanticism , and seventy years ago with classicism .

		The literature of the future will be a naturalism wid - ened by being reformed out of certain romantic and especially classic elements , a synthesis , as it were , of the three doctrines of art which our literature has evolved since the Renaissance . ''

		The persistence of the romantic tendency is the keynote of
Herr Ernst Heilborn	ORGANIZATION	's account of the German literature of the past year . ''

		Literary tendencies come and go , but that romantic undercurrent is enduring .

		What is designated as lit - erature and , dubbed as the < spirit of the age , ' fills up the pages of our histories of literature is , after all , only the property of a few cultured persons .

		The great mass of the people , at any rate in
Germany	LOCATION	, remain untouched by it .

		They continue to lead their own intel - lectual life ; and only those writers who strike the notes that find an echo in the popular range of feeling are able to conquer this tough and unwieldy mass , and so win their way ' to the people . '

		Now and then it happens that this undercurrent , which regularly reveals itself in the back-staircase novels and stories of the people , extends its dominion over literature proper of course , in some higher and purer manifestation .

		Or else the same mood may prevail among the cultured and the masses , though with different effects on the feelings .

		Such a period seems at hand .

		Unless all the signs are deceptive , we are steering towards a new romanticism . ''

		The indications of this drift are numerous , among them being the two here mentioned : '' Next winter a theatre is to be opened in
Berlin	LOCATION	de - voted principally , if not exclusively , to a new romantic movement .

		Quite lately a series of lectures was given in one of the artistic salons of
Berlin	LOCATION	, with the expressed object of paving the way for interest in and compre - hension of romantic art . ''

		The drama occupies the forefront of the present discussion , and
Herr Heilborn	PERSON	presents unusu - ally interesting summaries of the important plays of the year . ''


Gerhart Hauptmann	PERSON	's latest work , the farce ' Schluck und Jau , ' deals with quite a romantic sub - ject , familiar from one of the stories in the Arabian Nights ' as well as one of the plays by the Danish dram - atist
Holberg	PERSON	; still more familiar in the Introduction to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's ' Taming of the Shrew . '

		His companion has to play the part of his consort and to deceive his com - rade , who is the dupe .

		... In sharp contrast to the broken-down drunkard are the members of the hunting party ; on their behalf
Hauptmann	PERSON	has for the first time invented a dignified yet characteristic style , abounding in metaphor ; even in the '
Versunkene Glocke	PERSON	' there was too great a tendency to allusiveuess . ''


Herr Max Halbe	PERSON	's new play , ''
Das Tausend	PERSON	- jjihrige Keich , '' has for its subject '' the old dream that Christ would come again to estab - lish an earthly kingdom of happiness and gentle peace a conception which Christian - ity has taken over as a legacy from Judaism . ''

		The author '' plants this dream in the heart of a man of the people , a village blacksmith .

		While famine prevails in the land and revolu - tionary bands are stirring up strife for this is the year

		In

		He tries to introduce work into
Lazyland	LOCATION	, and this leads to terrible disturbances , so that he is glad enough to wake up once more in the reality he had despised . ''


Herr Georg von Ompteda	PERSON	is the author of '' Worth , '' a one-act piece `` which satisfies the most exacting demands in its simple and poetic expression . ''

		Compared with this little piece , '' The play which is regarded as the great dramatic success of the year ,
Max Dreyer	PERSON	's ' Probekandidat , ' ap - pears somewhat threadbare .

		It owed its success to its ' purpose , ' and this is laudable enough , but , like every other purpose , it tends to injure what is the chief aim of all art , the purely human interest ; in fact , it is truth that suffers .

		A young teacher during his probationary period expounds Darwinian views to the highest class in the natural history lesson .

		The school comes under clerical influence , the head master is a time-server , and the young probationer is called upon to retract his state - ments in a public lesson .

		The pressure of domestic circumstances compels him to consent ; but when it comes to the point , and he looks into the clear eyes of his pupils , the truth overwhelms him with irresistible force , and instead of retracting , he confirms his pre - vious statements with greater emphasis .

		He is dismissed , he loses his sweetheart , but in his heart he feels a sense of victory , and the play ends with an epigram . ''

		Herr von
Wildenbrach	ORGANIZATION	's new historic tragedy , '' Die
Tochter des Erasmus	PERSON	, '' is thus charac - terized : '' Passionate love for German nationality and patriotic sentiment , for pure doctrine and unfettered belief , en - thusiasm for the capacity for enthusiasm , animates the whole play .

		Even the dramatic situation depends on it .

		Erasmus of
Rotterdam	LOCATION	appears as the cool , scep - tical critic ;
Hutten	PERSON	, at first his friend , is the enthusiast .

		Erasmus 's daughter is naturally her father 's true child , all reason and calm calculation ; it is her love for Hut - ten that effects the great transformation in her .

		As his mistress she follows him into banishment and misery .

		At last the score has to be settled between his daughter and
Erasmus	PERSON	, now grown an old man .

		Then she , the disgraced and abandoned in the eyes of the world , re - nounces him , and breaks her staff over him . ''


Herr Heyse	PERSON	, at the age of seventy , has written a ''
Neues Marchenbuch	PERSON	, '' which is called the best product of his old age .

		The '' tales are simple and unpretending , some of them only fresh versions or interpretations of old fairy tales ; but there is unusual grace in their form , and they are pervaded by a peculiar restrained humour accompanied by a tinge of sadness . ''


Herr P. K. Rosegger	PERSON	's novel , `` Erdsegen , '' takes us to a peasant 's cottage among the au - thor 's native mountains , and draws a sharp and too didactic contrast '' between the patriarchal existence on mountain heights and life in a great city . ''

		`` The same civilization which Rosegger desires to banish from his world becomes in Adolf Wilbrandt a refined intellectual culture , the force that sustains life .

		Wilbrandt , another distinguished representative of the older generation in our literature , delights in depicting as the leading figure of his stories an ideal of free , intellectual , ethical manhood , such as he cherishes in his own heart . ''

		He has published two stories , ''
Erika	PERSON	'' and '' Das Kind , '' which embody this ideal . ''

		Thekla Ludekind , '' by
Herr W. von Polenz	PERSON	, '' is an educational romance , of the kind that *
Wilhelm Meister	PERSON	' made popular in German literature , a book in which life itself plays the part of the educator . '' ''

		The book is good , as marking an advance , not only in
Polenz	LOCATION	's own development , but also in the present position of our fiction as a whole .

		The same may be even more emphatically asserted of
Georg	PERSON	von Omp - teda 's novel ' Eysen . '

		Polenz bases his picture on the individual fortunes of one person , while
Ompteda	PERSON	's 1
Eysen	PERSON	' rests on a broader basis .

		The book bears the characteristic sub-title Deutscher Adel urn
1900	DATE	, ' and describes the fortunes of a whole family , the von Eysens ; but though the interest is equally directed to a variety of figures , artistic unity is by no means lacking . ''


Herr Detlev von Liliencron	PERSON	has this year pub - lished a few new poems in the collection , ''
Nebel	PERSON	und
Sonne	PERSON	. '' ''

		He possesses a warm masculine temperament which carries one away ; a daring humour which can make head against life pervades the elegiac atmosphere ; and when his poems originate in mystic sentiment this mys ticism springs from true nature feeling ... There i 70 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, a curious contradiction about his moods , but no matter what their character , their effect is genuine . ''

		Other volumes of poetry are by
Fraulein Anna Bitter	PERSON	and
Herr Carl Spitteler	PERSON	.

		In literary criticism and miscellany , mention is made of Professor
Grimm	PERSON	's '' Fragmente , '' of
Fraulein Kicarda Huch	PERSON	's '' Aus der Friihzeit der Ro - mantik , '' of
Herr Julius Rodenberg	PERSON	's ''
Jugen	PERSON	- derinnerungen , '' and of
Ludwig Bamberger	PERSON	's posthumous ''
Erinnerungen	PERSON	. ''

		At the close of his discussion , the author reverts to his key - note , and says : '' A new romantic movement is making way in art .

		Whether it will bear fruit who shall say ?

		Yet to me it seems to originate in an awakening desire for greater depth and thoughtfulness , and the longing that still seeks timidly and hesitatingly for expression is a holi - day yearning after inner contemplation .

		If this be so , the fruits can not fail to appear . ''

		COMMUNICA TION .

		WHO ARE THE ENGLISH PEOPLE ?

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		May I take exception to a passage which I note in your issue of
June 1	DATE	-LRB- pp. 442-443 -RRB- in a paragraph entitled '' The Fighting Englishman '' ?

		The passage is as follows : '' Dr.
Fitchett	PERSON	's own pages must often enough traverse the assumption of his title -LSB- How
England	LOCATION	saved
Europe	LOCATION	' -RSB- by showing how often , during the Napoleonic wars , it was not the English , but the Celts , the Scotch and Irish contingents of the British forces , that did the bulk of the fighting . ''

		This criticism would only be justified if the word English had in Dr.
Fitch	PERSON	- ett 's work a racial significance opposed to the word Celt .

		It has not , nor has it in current usage ; it connotes , on the contrary , all the inhabitants of the British Isles not merely those of the country south of the Cheviots and west of Offa 's Dyke .

		It is as justifiable , historically , in this sense as the term French , which connotes popu - lation without a drop of Frankish blood in their veins , population speaking Celtic and Germanic languages , as well as population speaking a very different form of Romance from that known as French ; population , I may add , which within a very recent historical period were bitterly opposed to the hegemony of
France	LOCATION	proper .

		All modern nations are amalgams ; it is practically impossible to devise a name which shall express every element of the amalgam ; it is inevitable that that ele - ment which takes the lead by virtue of position , supe - rior energy , and superior wealth -LRB- of all kinds -RRB- , should impose its name .

		In the present case your criticism is the more unfortunate because it was
England	LOCATION	in the narrow sense in which you take the term rather than
England	LOCATION	in the larger sense -LRB- t. e. , the British Isles -RRB- in which Mr.
Fitchett	PERSON	takes it , which did `` save
Europe	LOCATION	. ''

		So far as the power of
Napoleon	PERSON	was shattered by fight - ing , it was shattered by sea-fighting , the partakers in which were almost entirely Englishmen in the narrower sense .

		But , as a matter of fact , it was the policy of stubborn and indomitable opposition to
Napoleon	PERSON	, far more than the fighting by which it was supported , which ultimately won the day ; and for this policy the specific - ally English portion of the British Isles was responsible .

		In the same paragraph , you continue : `` To come nearer our own day , what sort of showing must
Tommy Atkins	PERSON	proper -LRB- though outnumbering his foes four to one -RRB- have made against the hardy South African ranch - man without the support of the Scotch and Irish and Colonials ? ''

		In the first place , if you deduct Scotch and Irish and Colonial troops from the British forces the residue does not outnumber the Boer forces '' four to one , '' however low an estimate be made of the latter .

		In the second place , it is quite illusory to imagine that the territorial designations of our regiments imply ex - clusive connection with different localities .

		There are Londoners in
Highland	LOCATION	regiments , there are Irishmen and Highlanders in South '' English '' regiments .

		But thirdly -LRB- and this is a simple matter of fact -RRB- there has been no such distinction as you imply between the dif - ferent regiments ; the errors of conduct have been spread over the same area and that the whole of the army as the excellences of conduct .

		The '' cockney '' whom you decry -LRB- without , if I may urge , knowing any - thing about him -RRB- has fought quite as well as the man from
Devon	LOCATION	, or
Tipperary	LOCATION	, or
Carnarvon	LOCATION	, or Lanark , or Rosshire ; just as well , but no better , and at times he has had to put up with nasty reverses equally with his '' rural '' or '' Celtic '' comrade .

		As a matter of fact , the '' cockney '' is by no means so largely repre - sented in the ranks of the British army as you seem to think , more 's the pity , perhaps , as he is , like the Parisian , a first-class fighting man , making up in ner - vous energy what he lacks in stamina .

		One more point : You speak of the '' ludicrous failure of the English attempt to raise in the rural districts a corps of rough riders ' on the American model . ''

		You are misinformed on this matter .

		The attempt has not been a failure .

		The '' Yeomanry '' raised in all parts of the British Isles -LRB- it was the Irish corps which has suf - fered the chief reverse that has befallen this branch of the forces -RRB- has done excellent service and shown itself fully the equal of the American '' Rough Riders . ''

		The latter were doubtless a gallant set of men and did their duty nobly ; but you must pardon my pointing out that they had to face an enemy pour rire , and that they , at least once , got themselves , as volunteer troops will , into such a position that , had they been opposed by ca - pable sharpshooters like the
Boers	LOCATION	, scarcely a man would have escaped .

		I am convinced that the Rough Riders would have borne themselves as bravely at
Spion Kop	ORGANIZATION	or at
Gettysburg	LOCATION	as they did at
Santiago	LOCATION	; in either case they would have been exterminated , or they would have had to fall back , just as
Pickett	PERSON	's magnificent corps had to do .

		The American army has such a superb history of real fighting that it seems inadvisable to dwell overmuch upon the military promenade in
Cuba	LOCATION	.

		May I add that , although an Englishman in the nar - rower sense of the word , nay , a cockney , and one who glories in the name , I have for twenty years urged , in season and out of season , the importance of recog - nizing and fostering every element in our mixed British population .

		In especial I have extolled and vindicated the importance of the Celtic element .

		Nor have I other than the warmest feeling for the English race in
America	LOCATION	.

		I look upon Lincoln as the greatest man produced by our common race in the nineteenth cen - tury ; and I do think that some of his greatness is due to the blood derived ultimately from the British Isles , and from that portion of it to which you incorrectly , as I maintain would restrict the name
England	LOCATION	.

		The Chinese Empire , Past and Present , '' is a book of encyclopedic scope .

		Many sources are drawn upon for a knowledge of the

John Henry Gray	PERSON	,
Archdeacon	PERSON	of

		was once ; and a certain amused contempt for foreigners in general , and yellow-skinned for - eigners in particular , runs through her vivid pages .

		She gives a lively picture of the life led in Peking by Europeans connected with diplomacy , and from it may be obtained con - siderable light .

		Referring to the legations , she says : `` All these official European residences are main - tained on a scale of considerable splendor , and the sudden transfers from the noisome streets to the beau - tiful parks and garden compounds , the drawing-rooms and ball-rooms , with their brilliant companies living and amusing themselves exactly as in
Europe	LOCATION	, are among the greatest contrasts and surprises of Peking .

		The picked diplomats of all
Europe	LOCATION	are sent to Peking , paid high salaries , and sustained by the certainty of promo - tions and rewards after a useful term at Peking all but the American minister ... The diplomats in exile lead a narrow busy life among themselves , occupied with their social amusements and feuds , often well satisfied with Peking after their first months of disgust , resentment , and homesickness , and even becoming sensi - tive to any criticism or disparagement of the place ... '' For the nearly forty years that the fine flowers of European diplomacy have been transplanted to Peking , they have been content to wallow along this filthy Lega - tion Street , breathing its dust , sickened with its mud stenches , the highway before their doors a general sewer and dumping ground for offensive refuse of every kind .

		... ' We are here on sufferance , you know , ' said the meek and lowly diplomats .

		` We must not offend Chinese prejudices . '

		Moreover , all the legations would not subscribe to an attempted improvement fund , nor all unite in demanding that the Chinese should clean , light , pave , and drain Legation Street that jealousy of the great powers so ironically termed the Concert of
Europe	LOCATION	' as much to blame for the sanitary situation in one corner of Peking as for affairs in
Crete	LOCATION	and Ar - menia . ''

		It is evident that
Miss Scidmore	PERSON	has a hearty disgust for policies which lead the
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- ropean ministers to humiliate themselves for the sake of gaining a slight temporary advan - tage for their countries respectively , through their complaisance .

		Here , Mr.
Colquhoun	PERSON	brings more positive information to aid in an understanding of the situation , which will be referred to presently .

		For
Li Hung Chang	PERSON	,
Miss Scidmore	PERSON	enter - tains a real hostility .

		It is difficult to fathom Chinese methods at best , but no light is given by such a statement as this : The Russians chose
Li Hung Chang	PERSON	, who had served them well before , and deserved a reward and an incentive for the future -LSB- to attend the Tsar 's coronation ceremonies -RSB- .

		The Manchu enemies of the grand secre - tary , who hated him for the disasters attending the war -LSB- with
Japan	LOCATION	-RSB- he had protested against their inviting , hailed the idea of his going abroad .

		During his ab - sence they expected to undermine him thoroughly , never dreaming of the honors and distinction to be accorded the ' Grand Old Man of
China	LOCATION	, ' the absurdities of adu - 72 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, ation which all
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	were to heap upon a deposed and discredited provincial governor , a Chinese politician out of a job .

		They were dumfounded and chagrined when reports of Li 's triumphal progress reached
China	LOCATION	, and the cry was raised that the great tourist was assuming honors due a sovereign ... The
United States	LOCATION	, not first among Chinophile countries certainly , and whose regularly accredited ministers at Peking have received but the scantiest hospitality and very little courtesy from the individuals directing the Chinese government , spent thirty thousand dollars in
United States	LOCATION	gold entertaining this passed politician and ex-office-holder , and fairly outdid
Europe	LOCATION	in its abject attitude before this great hypnotizer . ''

		It is perhaps unfair to criticize the instruc - tion conveyed in a book which is certainly intended to be entertaining .

		Miss
Scidmore	PERSON	is at her best in describing visits of ceremony to some Manchu ladies of the court or to the family of a provincial magnate of the Chinese race .

		The book is a beautiful one , and reada - ble in every sense .

		Mr.
Colquhoun	PERSON	, whose ''
China	LOCATION	in Trans - formation '' will be recalled as a luminous book , is an indefatigable traveller and newspaper correspondent , and formerly held rank in the administration of affairs in
Burmah	LOCATION	and Ma - slionaland .

		He has recently made the long and arduous overland journey from
Russia	LOCATION	proper through
Siberia	LOCATION	to Peking , leaving the line of the new transcontinental railway , and forming estimates of
Manchuria	LOCATION	and other recently ac - quired Russian possessions which overthrow established opinions and indicate how rapidly the Tsar has been developing the deep and extensive policy of his imperial predecessors .

		A most instructive account of the vast sweep of the Cossack pioneers of empire through
Asia	LOCATION	serves as an introduction to the sudden acqui - sition of Port
Arthur	PERSON	, which brings to a fitting close the Siberian policy of the Russians by furnishing them with an unfrozen port on the
Pacific	LOCATION	.

		But
Manchuria	LOCATION	and
Liao Tung	PERSON	, though they enable the rulers of Muscovy to consider one definite aim fully accomplished , have only increased their appetite for more .

		As Mr.
Colquhoun	PERSON	says , with convincing logic : `` Attainment of the longed-for prize has given an added impetus of irresistible force to the ambition and enterprise of the Russians .

		Sweeping the hand across the map southward as far as the Great Wall , ' All that is ours ! '

		they exclaim in astonishment , contemplating their extraordinary windfall ; and they are hastening to take full advantage of their good fortune , as is evi - denced by the phenomenal activity recently witnessed at
Port Arthur	LOCATION	,
Talienwan	LOCATION	, and in the
Hinterland	LOCATION	, where many thousands of Cossacks and large bodies of Chinese are employed on fortifications , harbors , and railways , and by the increased zeal and energy with which the Construction of the trans-Siberian railway is being car - ried on .

		Many Russians , indeed , more advanced in their views , already include Tientsin and
Chefoo	PERSON	-LRB- that is to say , the whole Gulf of Pechihli -RRB- , and even Peking .

		... The alignment of the railway has been several times shifted farther and farther to the southwest , following the rapid succession of diplomatic achieve - ments . ''

		From the general tone of the book it is evi - dent that the author holds
Great Britain	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	to have been hoodwinked in the game of grab by the zealous agents of the Tsar , joining the American cause with that of the British quite as a matter of course .

		He shows that
Manchuria	LOCATION	, set down as worthless by the deluded British , is worth as much as
Canada	LOCATION	for purposes of development , and is regarded as an earthly paradise by the Russians from the arctic North .

		A glance at the map will show what its possibilities are by way of advance , the Russians at
Tsien Wei	ORGANIZATION	, on the great highway , being less than two hundred miles from the Chinese capital .

		The very possession of
Mukden	LOCATION	, the ancient seat of the Manchu power , gives the Tsar a prestige in the minds of the Chinese which is dangerous to the reigning family though the present de - termination of the long oppressed natives to rule themselves has apparently overthrown every European calculation ,
Russia	LOCATION	's with the rest .

		Though recent events vitiate many of Mr.
Colquhoun	PERSON	's conclusions respecting Chinese partiality for
Russia	LOCATION	, even to the point where the reader will suspect the author of exaggera - tion for the sake of awakening
Great Britain	LOCATION	to a realization of the facts , many of his sen - tences are illuminating , as , for example , these , taken from different portions of the book : ''
China	LOCATION	has now passed into such a condition that indifference is no longer possible for her , neither will it be long possible for us .

		It is preeminently true in
China	LOCATION	that whoever is not for
Britain	LOCATION	is against her , and the alternative must soon be faced by the most reluctant of governments : shall they vindicate the inter - ests of the British and of the Anglo-Saxon race gen - erally vigorously , manfully , and straightforwardly , or submit to their being completely crushed by the powers who are pressing forward their own claims to the entire exclusion of those of
Britain	LOCATION	? '' ''

		The policy of
Germany	LOCATION	in the
Far East	LOCATION	is , and must be , dependent on the basis of her world-policy a good understanding with
Russia	LOCATION	and it is idle for the British to expect
Germany	LOCATION	, now the neighbor of
Russia	LOCATION	in

Europe	LOCATION	, to depart from that programme .

China	LOCATION	.

		The trail of the foreigner is on the land from north to south .

		The Western powers have come to stay , and the extension of the present spheres is merely a matter of time .

		Internally , the forces mak - ing for rebellion on a grand scale are daily gaining strength , and , once they realize that no power exists to suppress them , will usurp in vast regions the office of government . ''

		It is noteworthy that the price President
Krueger	PERSON	said he would make
England	LOCATION	pay for taking the
Transvaal	LOCATION	is growing larger with every day of British conquest in
South Africa	LOCATION	, Mr.
Colquhoun	PERSON	himself admitting the loss of prestige the British name has suffered in the
Far East	LOCATION	through the war against the burghers .

		The paltry gold of the
Witwatersrand	LOCATION	, most of it owned on the Continent of
Europe	LOCATION	in any event , seems to have effectually decoyed
Britain	LOCATION	away from her real imperial interests , which are certain to suffer in
China	LOCATION	through the entente between
Russia	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Just as the unorganized opposition of the Fili - pino `` savages '' keeps the American imperialist from being anything more than a politician at this time , with the certainty that the govern - ment is , like
England	LOCATION	's , powerless to protect its great commerce with
China	LOCATION	, so the imperial armies of the Empress of
India	LOCATION	are preoccupied with spreading civilization among the Dutch , when they might be enjoying the spoils of piracy with those nations which talk less about
Chris	PERSON	- tianity and civilization and have a keener nose for loot .

		It is of the individual Chinaman , not of the nation , that the Reverend Doctor
Arthur Smith	PERSON	treats in his '' Village Life in
China	LOCATION	, '' and his panoramic volume shows how human the pig - tailed Celestial is , all testimony of those who do not know him so well to the contrary not - withstanding .

		Doctor
Smith	PERSON	writes from an intimate knowledge , his work being both an expansion and a supplement to his earlier '' Chinese Characteristics . ''

		He paints a suc - cession of pictures , showing a patient and long - suffering folk , whose struggle for mere exist - ence has taken from them many of the finer qualities of humanity to leave them the very exemplars of the earth for the ability to be content upon nothing .

		So overcrowded is the country , so honored from age to age the equiv - alent of the scriptural injunction to '' increase and multiply , '' that no people can surpass the Chinese for patience , for industry , and for adaptability to hard conditions .

		Dr.
Smith	PERSON	says : '' Poverty in
China	LOCATION	is often a synonym for the most abject misery and want .

		The entire possessions of great numbers of the people would not amount in value to five dollars , and thousands of persons never know whence the next meal is to come .

		Such persons would in
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- ropean countries constitute what are called the dan - gerous classes . '

		In
China	LOCATION	, unless their distress is extreme , they do not mass themselves , and they seldom wage war against society as a whole . '' ''

		A few small birds , and the common hare , seem to constitute the objects most frequently shot , but except in the case of the limited number of those who make a business of securing such game to sell as a means of support , there are very few persons who devote their energies to any form of hunting .

		Indeed , the instinct which is said to lead the average Englishman to remark It is a fine day , let us go and kill something , ' is totally lacking in the Chinese . '' ''

		To the intelligent foreigner , the most prominent fact in
China	LOCATION	is the poverty of its people .

		There are too many villages to the square mile , too many families to the village , too many mouths to the family .

		Where - ever one goes , it is the same weary tale with intermina - ble reiteration .

		Poverty , poverty , poverty , always and evermore poverty .

		The empire is broad , its unoccupied regions are extensive , and its undeveloped resources undoubtedly vast .

		But in what way can these resources be so developed as to benefit the great mass of the Chinese people ?

		By none with which we are acquainted or of which we can conceive , without a radical disturb - ance of the existing conditions .

		The seething mass of over-population must be drawn off to the regions where it is needed , and then only will there be room for the relief of those who remain ... War , famine , pesti - lence sweep off millions of the population , but a few decades of peace seem to repair the ravages of the past , which are lost to sight , like battlefields covered with wide areas of waving grain . ''

		These are a few scattered excerpts from a book which should be read as a whole , one which it is hard to overpraise .

		It is apparent that the Chinese dislike foreigners , but the dislike seems to
spring	DATE	from the active inter - vention of the conservative literary class in concrete examples , rather than to be based upon anything more hostile than the dislike of all ignorant folk for strangers .

		It is to be learned that there are a million of native Ro - man Catholics distributed through twenty-five bishoprics in
China	LOCATION	, with fifty thousand pro- testants of all denominations , the Catholics being independent of European contributions either in men or money .

		Many other surprises are contained in one or another of these books , which are all in a degree complementary of and supplementary to one another .

		Yet , when all have been read and digested , there will be found something very baffling beneath all the information and speculation , bearing out to the full Doctor
Smith	PERSON	's dictum , '' It is seldom safe to generalize in regard to anything in
China	LOCATION	. ''

		74 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	THEOCRACY AND DEMOCRACY .

		* Though the title of Mr.
Howe	PERSON	's book on '' The Puritan Republic of the
Massachusetts Bay	LOCATION	'' suggests to the reader , and was prob - ably suggested by , Mr.
Goodwin	PERSON	's '' Pilgrim Republic , '' yet the comparison ends with the titles .

		Mr.
Goodwin	PERSON	traced in a minute man - ner the development of what was indeed , from first to last , the `` Pilgrim Republic . ''

		Mr.
Howe	PERSON	could not exhibit a parallel process in
Massachusetts Bay	LOCATION	, for the process there was radically different from that in
Plymouth	LOCATION	.

		In - deed , he has not , in the contents of his book , illustrated his title .

		He has re-stated the de - tails , in succinct and agreeable form , of the establishment of the Puritan Theocracy in the
Bay Colony	ORGANIZATION	.

		Of his eighteen chapters , the eleventh closes with his account of the '' Fall of the Theocracy . ''

		In the succeeding chap - ters he traces the development , out of the the - ocratic system first established , of the principles and practice of local representative government ; and next the growth of the idea of federation , as exemplified in the association of the
United Colonies of New England	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is made plain in his pages that the sturdy independence of the
Massachusetts	LOCATION	Bay colonists , which was so great a factor in the
American Revolution	ORGANIZATION	, grew up on the ruins and after the fall of the theocracy .

		It was in spite of Puritanism , and in opposi - tion to its spirit and tendencies in government , that a popular representative system was devel - oped .

		The commonwealth utilized many of the liberal ideas which had distinguished the government of the Pilgrims ; but the influences thus contributed by the
Pilgrim Republic	LOCATION	to the commonwealth into which it was merged are not here given the prominence they deserve .

		The republic in the
Bay Colony	ORGANIZATION	, though pro- moted by many persons of Puritan antecedents and sympathies , was not a Puritan movement ; and the title of Mr.
Howe	PERSON	's book is misleading .

		This contribution to
Massachusetts	LOCATION	history is written in protest against the strictures of the
Brooks Adams	ORGANIZATION	school concerning the theo - crats , and with a desire to treat them fairly , and to place honorably to their credit their sturdiness , energy , and honesty .

		Mr.
Howe	PERSON	emulates the calmness and impartiality of Pal - frey , and seeks to recall criticism from the extreme views championed by our contempo - rary Adamses .

		He has not veiled the excesses * THE PURITAN REPUBLIC OF THE
MASSACHUSETTS	LOCATION	BAT IN
NEW ENGLAND	LOCATION	.

		or absurdities of the theocratic government , nor sought to palliate or excuse them .

		His summary statement , in the compass of a few chapters , of the characteristics , habits , mode of life , aims and plans of government of the Puritans of the
Bay Colony	ORGANIZATION	presents the whole subject , in its various aspects , in convenient and succinct form .

		It is an admirable con - densation of the historical matter to which so many compendious volumes have been devoted .

		Extenuating nothing , and setting down nothing in either malice or prejudice , Mr.
Howe	PERSON	dem - onstrates that there were merits even in this system , which has become so far outgrown that no one now has any sympathy for it .

		The facts he has summarized , in his concluding chap - ters , tracing the '' Genesis of a still greater Re - public , '' show clearly how the vigorous and trenchant democracy of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	became the prototype and the inspirer of a democratic spirit of continental operation , and illustrate the extent of our national indebtedness to the rejected theocracy .

		The position of the Theocrats respecting re - ligious toleration is here stated with a dignified calmness .

		They did not pretend that heresy should be tolerated , even in themselves .

		They maintained their own immunity from hostile ac - tion by the English government , '' not because it had no right to punish men for advocating heretical views , but because their views were not heretical '' ; and they asserted the right to punish , as they did , those who held certain views , `` because , as they believed , such views were heretical , and dangerous to church and state '' -LRB- p. 256 -RRB- .

		So the Puritans are acquitted of the common accusation of insincerity . ''

		Whatever else they were , '' says Mr.
Howe	PERSON	, '' they were not hypocrites .

		They did not de - vour widows ' houses and for a pretense make long prayers '' -LRB- p. 256 -RRB- .

		They possessed a share of the intense intolerance of their age , '' and of whatever there was heroic in it , the Puritans presented the highest types '' -LRB- p. 258 -RRB- .

		So the author strives to retouch the gloomy portraits of the Puritan ministers which have been '' painted by
Oliver	PERSON	and
Brooks Adams	PERSON	, '' and to remove the impression '' evidently sought to be conveyed by Mr.
Charles Francis Adams	PERSON	, that the Puritans themselves were hypocritical , or at least incon - sistent '' -LRB- p. 255 -RRB- .

		But with all his generosity of feeling for the accused colonists of the
Bay	LOCATION	, Mr.
Howe	PERSON	turns sharply against them when he comes to consider their politics .

		In two chapters he
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 75 traces chronologically the resistance of the Puritans of the Theocracy and of the statesmen of the Commonwealth to the attempted aggres - sions of the
British Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, under the title of '' The Struggle for Independence . ''

		This resistance , from as early as
1646	DATE	at least , down to
1776	DATE	, Mr.
Howe	PERSON	stigmatizes as aiming really at independence , while covered with a thin veneer of pretended allegiance to the crown .

		In his view , the constant assertions by the col - onists of such allegiance were as thoroughly devoid of sincerity as were their religious as - sertions in the view of the Adamses .

		To ex - ploit this view , that the Bay colonists were in fact struggling for independence for a hundred and thirty years , seems to be one object of Mr.
Howe	PERSON	's book .

		`` It is certain , '' he says , `` that long before the end of the commonwealth '' they entertained this idea .

		They admitted only '' some shadowy sort of allegiance to En - gland , '' and they '' did try to demonstrate how they could be independent and at the same time owe allegiance to
England	LOCATION	, but the ex - periment was a failure '' -LRB- p. 319 -RRB- .

		After the accession of
Charles II.	PERSON	, their struggle is '' seen more and more clearly '' to be one for inde - pendence .

		The answers of the colonial gov - ernment in
1681	DATE	to the complaints of the king `` were probably the best that could be de - vised , '' but Mr.
Howe	PERSON	is not surprised that they '' were far from being satisfactory '' to the king .

		So he industriously convicts the colon - ists of a studied hypocrisy in politics , only equal in degree to that in religion of which Mr.
Adams	PERSON	convicts them , but of which we have seen Mr.
Howe	PERSON	acquit them .

		The fre - quent assertion of the
Massachusetts	LOCATION	leaders in the Revolution , that they , in common with all the other colonists , aimed in the beginning , not at independence , but only at the preserva - tion of their rights under the British constitu - tion , was indeed hypocrisy most offensive , if Mr.
Howe	PERSON	's views are correct .

		It is plain that he has wholly failed to ap - prehend the position of the colonies ,
Massa	PERSON	- chusetts included , before the
Declaration of Independence	ORGANIZATION	, as to their constitutional rela - tions to the crown of
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		This appears from his assertion that the Bay colo - nists '' by their acceptance of the charter had recognized the authority of
England	LOCATION	to levy and collect taxes , one of the highest attributes of sovereignty '' -LRB- p. 355 -RRB- .

		The arguments of
John Adams	PERSON	and
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	as to the position of the colonists as separate parts of the British empire , and their several allegiance to the crown , which were based in part on the same historical precedents as those cited by the Bay colonists in
1646	DATE	, would have no effect upon our author , for they were only '' verbi - age '' when used by these Puritans .

		In all this , he seems to have taken his cue from Mr.
Brooks Adams	PERSON	, who , in his '' Emancipation of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, '' demurs to the legal views of Mr.
John Adams	PERSON	, expressed in
1776	DATE	, as to the `` nullity of the acts of Parliament '' against which he and his compatriots had so earnestly protested -LRB- p. 302 -RRB- , and who thinks the colonial clergy of
1646	DATE	, in their statement of the colonial relations toward
England	LOCATION	, wished '' to enjoy tHe privileges and safe - guards of British subjects without yielding obedience to British law '' -LRB- p. 90 -RRB- .

		But even Mr.
Brooks Adams	PERSON	, while he doubted the soundness of the legal views of his great an - cestor , did not go on to criticize him as a hyp - ocrite in pretending that independence was a second thought , but says , in the same thesis , that not only
Washington	LOCATION	but
Jefferson	PERSON	and
Adams	PERSON	were at first opposed to the idea of sep - aration from
Great Britain	LOCATION	-LRB- p. 347 -RRB- .

		The new historical theories of the modern Adamses are hardly a safe guide for historians .

		Mr.
John Adams	PERSON	, in his arguments in support of the constitutional position so carefully as - sumed by the American colonies under his guidance , successfully refuted the
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	- ary assumptions by precedents from British historical and juridical sources , proved by those precedents the right of each colony to have its internal affairs , including taxation , regulated by its own legislative assembly , and demonstrated the superior acquaintance of American lawyers with the British constitution .

		The pages of Mr.
Howe	PERSON	's '' Puritan Republic '' abound with statements and arguments and protests made by the colonists of whom he writes , which evidence their ability , early and late , as constitutional statesmen .

		He might well have selected this feature of their history namely , their struggle for their constitutional rights as illustrated in the citations he has made from their deliverances , to be his special thesis .

		sage of belief into what is known as the
New Theol	LOCATION	- ogy .

		A remarkable chapter in religious speculation is discussed with ability and in a liberal spirit .

		The Rev.
Leighton Pullan	PERSON	has given us a minute historical sketch of the growth of the Book of Com - mon Prayer , and of its relation to other similar compilations .

		The work is made up of a series of relatively trifling facts with no commanding views ; and an intense interest in the subject itself is re - quired to make it readable .

		`` The State and the Church '' is historical and critical .

		It is popular in form , and is exceedingly discursive .

		It lacks that systematic , thorough , and independent line of thought which would make it valuable to the scholar .

		The book is strongly American in its temper . ''

		Faith and Sight '' is a clear , able , and candid production .

		Its main purpose is to give agnosti - cism standing in the religious court , and to put it on terms of giving and receiving with definite forms of faith .

		The chief criticism we are disposed to pass upon it is , that the author , in common with so many , seems inclined to separate science and faith widely from each other , assigning the one a force more absolute , and the other a form less verifiable , than belong to them respectively .

		Knowledge is one , from side to side .

		The same elements enter into it everywhere .

		What we know , we know under the same general conditions and by virtue of the same powers .

		We might as well think of the at - mosphere as without moisture , and of the ocean as without air , as to think of science as without the fallibility of human conceptions , or of religion as without the basis of valid experiences .

		The essays that make up the volume called `` Ethics and Religion '' were written early in the opening of the Ethical Movement , and '' then gave character and direction '' to it .

		They are the pro- duction of leaders in that movement , and are of deep interest .

		There is no spirit current among men more pure , discriminating , and gentle than the distinctively ethical spirit ; and none with which our social and religious life can be more advan - tageously infused .

		These essays are fitted to test and to stimulate the spiritual tone of every thought - ful man .

		The volume entitled `` Theism in the Light of Present Science and Philosophy '' is a series of lect - ures given as the first course on the foundation of the
Charles F. Deems Lectureship	ORGANIZATION	.

		As the title implies , the lectures are primarily philosophical .

		They do not seem to us to be as interesting or as profitable as the extended knowledge and marked resources of the author should have made them .

		While a general line of thought is indicated in them , they unfold too much as an endless series of observations .

		We are not held close to a well de - fined purpose .

		It is hard to tell where we are , or whither we are going .

		Decision in announcing one 's object , and tenacity in pursuing it , are espe - cially needful in a region of thought which suffers so much from a vague and changeable outlook .

		THE DIAL 77 Dr.
Coe	PERSON	's work on '' The Spiritual Life '' calls for a favorable notice .

		It is a wise and patient effort to inquire into the physical conditions , especially those of temperament , which affect our spiritual life and oftentimes give color to it .

		While assign - ing due importance to these facts , the author does not use them as a means of subverting the spiritual phenomena under consideration .

		We shall be better able to handle our own lives and the lives of others by virtue of this discussion . ''

		Back to Christ '' is a book which springs from a strong sense of the confusion and failure that have accompanied theological speculations .

		The tone and purpose elicit our sympathy ; but the au - thor pushes his remedy too far .

		We are not to be led back to Christ simply as an authority .

		A better phrase is '' Forward with Christ . ''

		Each man must be an authority to himself , no matter by whom he is led and taught .

		The autocracy of the spirit is the leading fact of the spirit , and the pivotal point on which debate is revolving .

		Christ leads us into truth .

		The books of Dr.
Washington Gladden	PERSON	belong to a class one is glad to recommend .

		They are liberal , practical , and stimulating .

		The style is agreeable and the matter is instructive .

		Dr.
Gladden	PERSON	is a favorable example of the efficiency of the new the - ology in every good word and work .

		The present volume , '' How Much is Left of the Old Doctrines ? ''

		is a detached discussion of a variety of current re - ligious themes , such as '' What is the Supernatural ? ''

		What is the Bible ? '' ''

		Is there a Personal Devil ? ''

		It is characterized by sound sense . ''

		The Personality of Truth '' is brief and bright , and sound in its main contention .

		The assertion of the personality of man as the indissoluble unit in all analytic processes , is the impregnable citadel of spiritual truth .

		However the battle may go here and there in the open field , man has only to retire into himself and be safe .

		Truths , like words , lie between persons .

		Truth involves the giving and receiving mind , as much as does the tennis ball the two rackets .

		Bishop Huntington 's volume on '' Personal Reli - gious Life in the Ministry '' is made up of six dis - courses on such themes as '' Singleness of Heart , '' '' Self - Sacrifice , '' '' Thorough Service . ''

		In reading it , we are rid for the moment of all controversy .

		We are taken into the confidence of a single and pure heart , holding tenaciously by its own renovat - ing divine service . ''

		The Conception of Immortality , '' by Dr.
Josiah Royce	PERSON	, is a discussion of much ingenuity , of decisive literary merit , and , due allowance being made for the remoteness of the thought , one clearly rendered .

		It is a good running-mate with the discourse on the some theme recently given on the same foundation by Professor
James	PERSON	.

		That discussion suggested a possible reconciliation of immortality with physical forces : this discussion considers its possible har - mony with the relations of the spiritual world under an idealistic philosophy .

		One already well-grounded in the belief in immortality , and with a relish for astute thought , might read both works without any serious loss of faith .

		The doctrine of immortality , like an ocean current , is far-reaching though not conspicuous in its forces .

		The practical mariner will be profoundly aware of it ; the mere voyager may pass into it and out of it with little observation , and find difficulty in determining its whereabouts . ''

		Man and his Divine Father '' is a very discur - sive treatise .

		The subject is comprehensive , and it loses nothing in vagueness by the treatment .

		The volume ranges from a consideration of the nature of man and of God to the philosophy of
Philo	LOCATION	, the state of
Syria	LOCATION	, and the Apocalypse .

		The work evinces profound self-confidence , and is marked by rash and unguarded assertions .

		The author seems to think that if he but walks across the world , a conspicuous path will be left behind him which all men will do well to follow .

		The true things that are said are thus lost in the general confusion and irrelevancy of the method . ''

		An Essay toward Faith '' is a book of devotion fitted to deepen our thoughts of life without render - ing them morbid .

		It combines , with more success than is usual , the comprehensiveness of human feeling with its spiritual quality .

		The last two volumes on our list , while wholly unlike in contents , fall together in one respect .

		In both , Biblical thoughts and Biblical events are used in so rigid and narrow a way as largely to separate spiritual life from the normal history of the world , and to put it under a comparatively barren disci - pline of its own . ''

		Christ Came Again '' is a pains - taking book .

		It presents very fully the words of Christ , and the anticipation of his disciples in con - nection with his second coming .

		This expectation was deep-seated and general .

		The author is by no means as successful in showing that the destruction of
Jerusalem	LOCATION	, or any events in connection with it , were the fulfilment of this anticipation .

		As a matter of fact , they were not so regarded .

		The conviction lived on in spite of them , and has wrought mischief to our own time .

		Aside from a theoretical necessity of meeting the prophetic lan - guage with some corresponding event , few if any would have thought of the destruction of
Jerusalem	LOCATION	as standing for the coming of Christ .

		The author struggles with the fact that the minds of men have not seen or accepted the agreement between the expectation and its fulfilment .

		This lack of corre - spondence remains a serious obstacle to the theory of the absolute and accurate inspiration of the
New Testament	ORGANIZATION	.

		No ingenuity can evade the fact that the feelings called out and the events that followed after them have not corresponded with each other . ''

		The Crown of Christ '' is a series of Scripture readings , and of reflections meant to accompany the sacred seasons of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	in the circuit of its Liturgical Year .

		They are well of their kind , but , alas , what a kind !

		One is strongly and pain - fully impressed in this volume , and in the preceding one , with the immense burden of dogma and lit -

		Many nuts germinate slowly , or not at all , because of the thickness of the shell .

		Spiritual life is enveloped by a tenacious religiosity which separates it from the vitalizing power of the present .

		We have a liturgical year , and not God 's year of fresh experi - ences a world on the march .

		Many , like a timid woodsman , are trying to find their way by studying half-effaced , conflicting , and overgrown marks blazed on the trees ; they fail to comprehend the cardinal points of the compass , the lay of the land , and the world that envelopes them .

		When will men believe that God 's immediate word is as good as any word he has ever spoken , and , more than any , pertinent to our wants !

		These two books dis - close the ease with which believers make a religion , infinitely more narrow than our present living faith , out of the mere shreds and waste experiences of previous generations .

		BKIBFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Professor
Crawshaw	PERSON	, in his '' Liter - 7 Interpretation of Life '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- , shows that literature , as a natural outgrowth of life , also reveals life .

		This revelation concerns the personality of the author , the age in which he lives , his race , and his nation - ality in distinction from his race .

		It is also the reflector of the broad traits of humanity .

		The influ - ence of
Taine	PERSON	is tolerably evident in the division of the subject-matter , and it must be said , as the au - thor anticipates in his prefatory note , that in the outlines of his course there is much that is reminis - cent of the beaten track .

		Yet there are numerous passages of vivid suggestion , as , '' When most sin - cere -LSB- literature -RSB- is less a desire to be heard than a desire to speak '' ; and , '' If the absolute truth of life could ever be presented , then any particular phase might be treated once and for all .

		It is because we can at best have only approximations to the truth that all artistic representations of life , even though they should cover essentially the same ground , have importance and value . ''

		The author uses as tools , to dig out the details of his amplifi - cation , a few favorite topics .

		He recommends , again and again , the chronological order of literary study , based on individual works and the complete works of individual writers .

		This completeness is to be extended to epochs , and to the synchronous production of several races , suggesting the need of more than one lifetime for the student .

		Contem - porary history is to be carefully studied as well , in order to reach the full revelation of literature , which includes both the external aspects of man , like his manners , and also his inward life or character .

		The revelation may be direct or indirect , conscious or unconscious , '' objective or subjective , '' the last set of terms being somewhat out of favor , one may remark , since
Carlyle	PERSON	's satirical description of
Cole	PERSON	- ridge 's monologue , in which these Kantian terms were mumbled .

		Browning , whose name appears again and again , is accepted as '' the sufficient rep - resentation of that power of genius which has filled the world 's literature with immortal creations of men and women who are at once living individuals and impressive types of the qualities and charac - teristics of humanity . ''

		Yet the author 's view in - cludes reference to names covering the whole field of English literature , and he makes illuminating mention of one or two American writers .

		Some of his quotations , like those from
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, show how very possible it is for good people to differ as to the value of poetical passages .

		A num - ber of topics are touched in a manner to open dis - cussion and stimulate thought .

		Indeed , the chief originality of the book , it would seem , lies in these incidental remarks .

		It is here that the author him - self appears .

		He is a stanch defender of literature as one of the arts , holding it to be the most natural and adequate means of human expression , perfect and universal .

		And his book will serve both the general reader and the teacher of literature by showing in how many different ways the study of literature may be profitably pursued .

		Christian To those who know Dr.
Thomas	PERSON	philosophy and
Chalmers	PERSON	simply as a great preacher , civic needs .

		an -LRB- j ag the i ea -LRB- j er of that dramatic secession from the Established Church which be - came the
Free Church of Scotland	ORGANIZATION	, his volume on `` The Christian and Civic Economy of Large Towns '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- will be something of a surprise , revealing him as a vigorous writer on some of the most important economic and sociological questions of the present day , such as wages , trades-unions , pauperism , savings-banks , mechanic schools , etc. .

		His treatment of these subjects is always from a practical and Christian standpoint , with the earnest intention of improving the condition of the working classes .

		He is not an original authority in economic theory ; but he is an independent thinker and a powerful writer .

		His theories go hand in hand with earnest practical work in the slums of Edin - burgh ; and in the book can be felt the heart-throbs of a man who is in personal contact with the men and women to whose sufferings and struggles he is attempting to apply the relief of Christian philos - ophy .

		The social settlement and institutional church of our day find their antetype in Dr.
Chal	PERSON	- mers 's later work , which called forth the admira - tion of Carlyle : '' What a wonderful old man
Chalmers	ORGANIZATION	is !

		When so many of us are wringing our hands in hopeless despair over the vileness and wretchedness of the large towns , there goes the old man , shovel in hand , down into the dirtiest puddles of the
West Port of Edinburgh	LOCATION	, cleans them out , and fills the sewers with living waters .

		It is a beautiful sight . ''

		The work of Dr.
C. R. Hender	PERSON	- son , in abridging Dr.
Chalmers	PERSON	's treatise , is admir - ably done .

		In a volume of 350 pages , he has condensed the three bulky volumes of the original
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 79 text , reproducing its exact words , but omitting repe - titions and matters of local or temporary interest .

		Connecting the portions of the original work thus transcribed , are '' bracketed additions designed to indicate the transitional thoughts or to explain some point which might otherwise be left in obscurity . ''

		Dr.
Henderson	PERSON	has also prefixed a valuable Intro - duction , in which Dr.
Chalmers	PERSON	's doctrines are carefully examined and his contributions to mod - ern thought considered .

		Hotel de Not infrequently the mention of the
Rambouillet Hotel de Rambouillet	ORGANIZATION	calls at once and the Precieuses .

		to the min -LRB- j of the gene ral reader of French literature scenes in
Les Precieuses Ridi	LOCATION	- cules , and he thinks of the first French salon only as the hot-bed of absurd affectations of speech , dress , and manners , which were epidemic in the seventeenth century .

		The world has joined so heartily with Moliere in the laugh at the expense of these faddists , who were only imitators of imi - tators , that it has often failed to appreciate the originators , the coterie which the
Marquise de Ram	ORGANIZATION	- bouillet gathered about her for twoscore years .

		The influence of this brilliant marquise was excep - tional , even in
France	LOCATION	, where women as society leaders have done so much .

		A misjudgment of the
Hotel de Rambouillet	ORGANIZATION	means a misunderstanding of some of the most important and characteristic fea - tures of
France	LOCATION	of the seventeenth century , in - deed , of
France	LOCATION	of all times ; for what is more peculiarly French than its social genius ?

		It is worth while for us Anglo-Saxons , who many times are keen for the vices and blind to the virtues of the French , to get a true conception of this salon , which , if it did contain the genius of affectation , threw its weight so unmistakably on the side of purity and refinement .

		It is interesting also to study the achievement of a woman who saw better things for her associates than formality and attend - ance on lectures and classes .

		A small library has already been written on the subject ; and the dif - ficult task which Mr.
Leon H. Vincent	PERSON	has per - formed in `` Hotel de Rambouillet and the Pre * - cieuses '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- is to condense the chief facts within about a hundred pages .

		He promises only a resume , but the bare bones show through but sel - dom .

		He has given an interesting as well as help - ful and suggestive narrative , which entices the reader into the wider fields opened by a valuable bibliography of the subject , appended to the book .

		Persistent features ^ n l '' 8 brief sketch of ''
France	LOCATION	Since of the French 1814 '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- ,
Baron Pierre	PERSON	constitutional life .

		de Coubertin has 8ought to bring clearly into view those elements in the political structure of
France	LOCATION	, which , though profoundly shaken by the revolutions of
1830	DATE	,
1848	DATE	, and
1870	DATE	, have nevertheless been preserved or restored .

		He thinks that the persistence of these features of French constitutional life has been obscured by the division of the whole period into sections , such as the '' Restoration , '' the '' Monarchy of
July	DATE	, '' the '' Republic of
' 48	DATE	, '' etc. , in this way emphasizing the phenomena of crises .

		To Louis XVIII .

		he gives the chief credit for whatever has been accom - plished toward establishing a sound constitutional system .

		And it was the prosperity which the re - stored monarchy created that enabled
Napoleon III.	PERSON	, in the early days of the Empire , to make
France	LOCATION	the arbiter of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Moreover , so soon as the spectre of the
June	DATE	days ceased to terrify the Bourgeoisie , the desire for a return to the con - stitutional system of the monarchy was difficult to resist , and the Empire became '' liberal . ''

		The
Third Republic	ORGANIZATION	, too , is in its governmental forms hardly more than a revival of the same constitu - tional system .

		This is
Baron de Coubertin	ORGANIZATION	's thesis , which gradually becomes clearer as one moves through his running commentary on
Nineteenth Century France	ORGANIZATION	.

		The second half of the book is stronger than the first , which abounds in strange , not to say untenable , views of the period from
1814	DATE	to
1848	DATE	.

		As has already been intimated ,
Baron de Coubertin	PERSON	has a high opinion of the statesman - ship of Louis XVIII .

		and of '' his intense moral energy . ''

		He has an equally unmeasured contempt for
Thiers	PERSON	, who , he thinks , was the principal mis - chief-maker in
July , 1830	DATE	.

		The Ordinances , he says , hardly constituted a coup d'etat , adding that it was only the absence of preparation for resist - ance that finally provoked the rioting .

		But the most extraordinary assertion in the book explains that `` the recognition of those Spanish colonies which were already constituted separate States , to - gether with their commercial liberty , '' was '' secured by our -LSB- sic -RSB- initiative . ''

		One or two curious verbal blunders have crept into the text : '' orthodoxes , '' referring to Greek Christians , and the '' Chamber of Communes '' for the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	.

		Croquet , properly so called .

		To those who in these days of golf are scornful of the game which we have heard called `` Presbyterian billiards '' we commend Mr.
Arthur Lillie	PERSON	's '' Cro - quet up to Date '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- .

		From that instruc - tive treatise many things may be learned , and , as not the least among them , respect for a game far superior to either tennis or golf in the opportunities which it offers for strategy and finesse , and , indeed , for most other forms of skill which demand some - thing more than brute strength .

		The term '' cro - quet , '' as here used , is of course something very different from that childish parody of the sport often practised upon American lawns , in which two shots are claimed for scoring two points at once , and in which the player puts his foot upon his own ball to keep it from following the ball that he is engaged in croquetting .

		These strange vagaries , and others equally weird , are , we believe , still prevalent in this country , and are even countenanced by the '' rules '' which the manufacturers of '' croquet sets '' provide for innocent purchasers .

		That they disappeared from the real game decades ago is a fact which all 80 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, players know , of course , but which it seems about as difficult to enforce upon old-fashioned persons as it is difficult to enforce the principles of modern whist upon persons who deem the last word to have been said by the earlier
Hoyle	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Lillie	PERSON	's book is full of interesting matter openings , systems of tactics , accounts of famous players , and suggestions for revised rules .

		We recommend it to all devotees of the unduly neglected game of skill with which it deals , and particularly to such others as , knowing nothing of the sport , have minds that are open to conviction upon the subject .

		An interesting little manual in eccle - English abbeyt oi oaf ?

		pal architpphirfi has hpon - and cathedrals .

		pared by Dr.
H. D. M. Spence	PERSON	, Dean of
Gloucester	LOCATION	, under the title of '' The White Robe of Churches '' -LRB-
Scribner	ORGANIZATION	's importation -RRB- .

		Living in
Gloucester	LOCATION	deanery , and in the very shadow of the grand Cathedral , various questions have from time to time naturally suggested themselves to Dr.
Spence	PERSON	, such as , '' At what special epoch , and under what special circumstances , were these inimitable mighty prayer-homes built ?

		and what special inspi - ration fired the builders ' hearts ?

		Was there any ancient type after which these grand piles were de - signed and finished ?

		Who were the builders ?

		What of the vanished dwellers in these abbeys and cloisters ?

		have they any special story ? ''

		It was in framing replies to these and kindred queries that Dr.
Spence	PERSON	's little book grew up .

		It is popular and entertaining , rather than drily technical , and writ - ten in a vein of pious enthusiasm that warms the style and fixes the attention of the reader .

		We know of no book of its scope in which the history and the main structural features of these grand and inspiring mediaeval edifices are more intelligently and attractively set forth for the general reader than this temptingly made and beautifully illus - trated one by Dean
Spence	PERSON	.

		There are sixty-eight plates , full-page and vignette , from photographs , drawings , and standard books on architecture .

		Urbanity , a light satiric touch , and seasonableness of theme , mark the essays by Mr.
Eliot Gregory	PERSON	which are grouped in a neat volume under the title '' The Ways of Men '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		There are thirty-three papers in all , under such tempting captions as '' Domestic Despots , '' '' Machine - Made Men , '' `` Some American Husbands , '' `` The Grand Opera Fad , '' '' The Genealogical Craze , '' '' Pre-palatial Newport , '' '' The Dinner and the Drama , '' etc. .

		Other papers , wherein the satirist of current follies and fleeting social affectations is less apparent , are : `` Cyrano ,
Rostand	PERSON	, Coquelin '' -LRB- substantially
M. Coquelin	PERSON	's own account , as given to Mr.
Gregory	PERSON	, of his earlier acquaintance with
M. Rostand	PERSON	and first production of '' Cyrano '' -RRB- ; '' Calve ' at
Cabri	LOCATION	- eres , '' ''
Carolus	PERSON	'' -LRB- Carolus-Duran -RRB- , `` Sardou at Marly-le-Roy , '' etc. .

		As a satirist of manners , Mr.
Gregory	PERSON	knows how to be both sensible and amus - ing ; and his gentle ridicule of passing folly is of the stingless kind that cures .

		Let us add that Mr.
Gregory	PERSON	will be better known to many under his pen-name , '' An Idler . ''

		He has '' idled '' to good purpose .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Dr.
Ernest F. Henderson	PERSON	's '' Side Lights on English History , '' published by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is a royal octavo volume of extracts from letters , papers , and diaries of the past three centuries .

		It places in the hands of students a great amount of original material , and is one of the most comprehensive and satisfactory of the many source-books that have been published during recent years .

		Even more interesting than the text is the series of sumptuous illustrations , eighty in number , with which it is provided .

		These are for the most part full-page portraits from contemporary paint - ings and engravings , and constitute such a series as can not be found in any other similar work .

		Mr.
Henry W. Elson	PERSON	has just published , through the Messrs.
Macmillan	PERSON	, a second volume of his readable and entertaining '' Side Lights on American History . ''

		The period covered is that from
1860	DATE	to the present time .

		The author gets on delicate ground when he discusses the recent war , and there is too much of the '' poor old
Spain	LOCATION	'' idea about his writing to win the approval of sober readers .

		But teachers , and others , will welcome this book as a whole , because of its intelligent account of such things as the
Alabama	LOCATION	Claims , the impeachment of
Johnson	PERSON	, and the
Electoral Commission	ORGANIZATION	of
1876	DATE	things about which it is not always easy to get definite and compact information .

		Mr.
Robert Waters	PERSON	is the author , and the
Edgar S. Werner Co.	PERSON	are the publishers , of a volume entitled '' Flashes of Wit and Humor . ''

		It is a pleasant little book , full of anecdotes and witticisms of all degrees of antiquity , collected into a series of chapters , to each of which the author gives a sort of unity by means of his own appreciative and genial commentary .

		He has a quick sense for the humorous phrase or situation , and a wholesome instinct for the rejection of anything that approaches coarseness or vulgarity .

		We are glad to say a word in commendation of this latest of ''
Joe Millers	PERSON	. '' ''


North America	LOCATION	'' is the subject of the second book in the series of geographies prepared for the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	by Professors
Ralph S. Tarr	PERSON	and
Frank M. Mc	PERSON	-
Murry	PERSON	.

		These books certainly solve the problem of reducing a school geography to the dimensions of an ordinary book , which alone should prove a potent rec - ommendation .

		They are in other respects thoroughly praiseworthy , being modern in scholarship and treat - ment , provided with all sorts of helpful suggestions for the work of teaching , as well as with illustrations in unusual number and variety .

		A handsomely-printed catalogue of the exhibit of the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	at the
Paris Exposition	ORGANIZATION	is issued by Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	.

		The catalogue is in three parts , devoted respectively to the Educational , Binding , and Paper exhibits .

		The illustrations of unique special bindings executed at the
Oxford Press	ORGANIZATION	, and the description of the wonderful
Oxford India	ORGANIZATION	paper , are the most noteworthy features of this altogether interesting catalogue .

		Some Problems of

Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The author of this mon - ograph was a promising scholar who died about a year ago at the age of twenty-six .

		The following numbers have just been added to the
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	series of studies in political science : '' Colo - nial Immigration Laws , '' by Mr.
E. E. Proper	PERSON	; `` His - tory of

United States	LOCATION	, '' by Dr.
W. H. Glasson	PERSON	; and '' History of the Theory of Sovereignty since

		The latest expression of the energy and good taste of the English firm of
Messrs. J. M. Dent & Co.	ORGANIZATION	is the series of '' Illustrated English Poems . ''

		Shelley 's '' The Sensitive Plant '' and
Cowper	PERSON	's ''
John Gilpin	PERSON	'' are the two widely different texts chosen to inaugurate the series .

		In his spirited drawings for ``
John Gilpin	PERSON	, '' Mr.
Brock	PERSON	proves himself the legitimate successor to
Randolph Caldecott	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Housman	PERSON	's work is strongly suggestive of Pre-Raphaelite influences , and the mystic quality of his drawings is well adapted to
Shelley	LOCATION	's lines . ''

		A High School Grammar , '' by Dr.
Brainard Kel	PERSON	- logg and the late
Alonzo Reed	PERSON	, with much helpful col - laboration from Professor
F. A. March	PERSON	, is a recent publication of Messrs.
Maynard	PERSON	,
Merrill & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It includes a good deal of historical and comparative grammar , with references to
Latin	LOCATION	, Old English , and the modern languages , which , of course , place it be - yond the reach of elementary school children , and jus - tifies its title .

		It seems an excellent book for its purpose .

		A new monthly magazine is about to make its appear - ance in
London	LOCATION	under the title of '' The New Liberal Review . ''

		It will resemble most of the well-known English reviews in form and size , and will include arti - cles on literary and general interest .

		In spite of its popular attractions , however , its principal aim is to be the monthly organ of liberal imperialism , with particu - lar attraction for the younger writers of the Liberal cause .

		The joint editors of the new venture will be Messrs.
Cecil	PERSON	and
Hildebrand Harmsworth	PERSON	.

		Messrs.
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish '' Specimens of the Forms of Discourse , '' a text for schools edited by Dr.
E. H. Lewis	PERSON	.

		Criticism is illustrated , as well as the four primary types of discourse , and there is a useful list of suggested exercises at the end of the volume .

		The same publishers send us an edition of
Tennyson	PERSON	's '' Princess , '' prepared by Professor
L. A. Sherman	PERSON	, and illustrating his peculiar methods of annotation and instruction .

		There is a sixty-page introduction upon poetic diction in general , full of solemn vagaries , and illustrated with remarkable diagrams .

		It is lucky that the approach to literature is not often hedged about with such forbidding defences .

		The organization is announced , in
New York City	LOCATION	, of the
American Publishers ' Association	ORGANIZATION	, with Mr.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	as President , Gen.
A. C. McClurg	PERSON	and Mr.
George Mifflin	PERSON	as Vice-Presidents , Mr.
George P. Brett	PERSON	-LRB- of
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- as Secretary , and Mr.
G. B. M. Harvey	PERSON	-LRB- of
Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- as Treasurer .

		The promotion of the interests of publishers , authors , book - sellers , book manufacturers , and bookbuyers is stated to be the general purpose of the association ; while , more specifically , an attempt will be made to secure greater uniformity of prices to the public and to pre - vent the '' cutting '' system which has proved so detri - mental and demoralizing to the regular book trade .

		Readers of the
American Economic Association	ORGANIZATION	's col - lection of critical monographs on '' The Federal Census , '' reviewed in THE DIAL a few months ago , will be inter - ested in a paper by Professor
Walter F. Willcox	PERSON	, one of the chief statisticians of the
Census Office	ORGANIZATION	in charge of
the Division of Methods and Results	ORGANIZATION	, and a contrib - utor to the former discussion , entitled '' Plans for the Twelfth Census , '' and in an '' Outline of the Plans for the Agricultural Census , '' by Mr.
H. T. Newcomb	PERSON	, also of the
Census Office	ORGANIZATION	.

		These papers were presented before the
Economic Association	ORGANIZATION	at its
Ithaca	LOCATION	meeting
last winter	DATE	, and have been printed in a separate pam - phlet , as well as in the proceedings of the association .

		Together they give a very good idea of what the
Census Office	ORGANIZATION	is doing and how it is doing it .

Barrett Wendell	PERSON	's forthcoming '' Literary History of

CONTINENTAL	ORGANIZATION	LITERATURE .

		ii .

		It is now about twenty years , says Mr.
C. K. Elout	PERSON	, writing of the literary history of the past twelvemonth in
Holland	LOCATION	, since '' De Nieuwe Gids '' started a new intellectual and artistic movement . ''

		The movement swept over the country like a huge wave , and caused an immense disturbance , for the bold behaviour of the young authors , their courageous criti - cism of their predecessors , and especially their coinage of new and strange expressions , roused a storm of anger and indignation .

		But at the same time a band of ad - mirers gathered around them with an enthusiasm equal to the indignation displayed on the other side .

		And for many years the battle went on fiercely .

		It looked as if both parties were determined to fight ' to the bitter end , ' but at length the opposition to the ' new literature ' was abandoned slowly and sullenly .

		The older gen - eration gave way .

		It continued writing in its own old - fashioned style though modified to a great extent by contact with its adversaries but it stopped criticizing . ''

		Of the writers who were identified with the new movement Messrs.
Verwey	PERSON	, van Deyssel , van Eeden , Gorier , and
Kloos	PERSON	only one , the first named , has published anything during the past year .

		The writer last named , however , has made a '' literary '' marriage which has at - tracted as much attention as a new book from his pen would have done .

		His bride is Miss
Jeanne Reyneke van Stuwe	PERSON	, whose first book , '' Hartstocht '' -LRB- Passion -RRB- , '' is a short novel in which the author describes the life of one whom she thinks to be a man of passion , but who is really nothing of the kind , merely a base and reckless rake . ''

		The same young woman '' has also issued a collection of poems in praise of Mr.
Kloos	PERSON	, which an outsider I mean one who is neither Mr.
Kloos	PERSON	nor Miss Reyneke can not help finding rather monotonous . '

		* The chief novels of the year are '' Als Kaf voor den Wind '' -LRB- As Chaff before the Wind -RRB- , by a pseudonymous lady ; `` Geloof '' -LRB- Faith -RRB- , by Miss de
Savornin Lohman	PERSON	; ''
Kameleon	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
V. Loosjes	PERSON	; and ''
Verborgen Bronnen	PERSON	'' -LRB- Hidden Springs -RRB- , by
Miss Augusta	LOCATION	de Wit .

		Mr.
Couperus	PERSON	has turned to fairy-tales .

		His '' Fidessa , '' '' is both interesting in its story and beautiful in the exquisite poetry of its language . ''

		The leading play of the year is Het Zevende Gebod '' -LRB- The Seventh Com - mandment -RRB- , by Mr.
Heyermans	PERSON	.

		This '' tragi - comedy of love without marriage in a flat in the Quartier Latin of
Amsterdam	LOCATION	'' has proved immensely successful as a stage production .

		Mr.
Leopold Katscher	PERSON	, writing from Hun - gary , begins his article with mention of some works of serious scholarship .

		Among them are the '' History of
Greece	LOCATION	'' of the late Pro- fessor Schvarcz ; a '' History of the Greeks , '' by Professor
G. Gyomlai	PERSON	; `` The Life and Poetry of
Imre Madach	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
M. Palagyi	PERSON	; , `` Hungarian Music in the Nineteenth Cen - tury , '' by Mr.
Kernel Abranyi	PERSON	; '' The
King	PERSON	- dom of
Hungary	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
A. V. Matlekovits	PERSON	; 90 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, '' Studies in Social Politics , '' by Mr.
Mano Somogyi	PERSON	; '' The Solution of the Peace Prob - lem , '' by Mr.
Ferencz Kemeny	PERSON	; and `` Wo - man 's Work , '' by Mr.
Andor Maday	PERSON	.

		In poetry , mention is made of Mr.
Sandor Feleki	PERSON	's '' Wandering Clouds , '' '' a collection of nearly a hundred pieces of genuine poetry of a dreamy sort , without a trace of artificiality . ''

		In the drama , there are '' Mother Earth , '' by Mr.
Istvan Geczy	PERSON	; '' Prince Unique , '' a fairy piece by Mr.
Elek Benedek	PERSON	; '' Learned Professor
Hatvani	PERSON	, '' a comedy in verse by Mr.
Emil Makai	PERSON	; and u Shakespeare , '' by Mr.
Arpad Zigany	PERSON	.

		In fiction , mention is made of '' Among Strangers , '' by Mr.
Ferencz Herczeg	PERSON	; '' Blue-Eyed Mrs.
Davidka	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
G. Gar	PERSON	- donyi ; '' The Last , '' by Mr.
Dezso Malonyay	PERSON	; and the '' Dying Gladiator , '' by Mr.
Arpad Abonyi	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Jokai	PERSON	's new book is the most important of all this fiction , and is character - ized as `` a highly fantastic romance , which created the more stir as the writer gave up his widower 's state last year in his seventy-fifth year to marry a young lady of twenty , and the book is highly personal , though not autobio - graphical .

		Love and old age are the subjects round which the master 's extraordinary imagi - nation revolves .

		He squanders a whole mine of sarcasm , humor , self-mockery , bitter truth , and romantic extravagance .

		This strange pro- duction reads like a fascinating mixture of
Boccaccio	LOCATION	,
Jules Verne	PERSON	, and
E. T. A. Hoff	PERSON	- mann . '' ''

		Aged but not Old '' is the appro - priate title of this characteristic work .

		In
Italy	LOCATION	, writes Sig .


Guido Biagi	PERSON	, the greatest literary successes of the year have been two foreign productions the '' Quo Vadis '' of Mr.
Sienkiewicz	PERSON	, and the '' Cyrano '' of
M. Rostand	PERSON	.

		The former , published in an author - ized translation by
Sig	ORGANIZATION	.


F. Verdinois	PERSON	, has , owing to a defect in the copyright laws , been also translated by several other hands , and thus pirated right and left .

		Its vogue , both as a book and as a drama , has been something ex - traordinary , and has even led to the prepara - tion of illustrated postcards , beyond which popularity can no farther go .

		The past year , '' which in the history of the Catholic world will be called the Anno Santo or year of jubilee might in a literary sense , as far as
Italy	LOCATION	is concerned , be called the Dantesque year , since in it coincide centenaries of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's vision , and also of the year of his priorate -LRB- 1300 -RRB- ... The cult of the hero as poet has taken at the present day a form which would have pleased even
Carlyle	PERSON	, since he is celebrated by the younger men , and becoming more and more popular . ''

		The Florentines have now a
Dante	ORGANIZATION	lectureship in full swing , and the poet is periodically ex - pounded in Orsanmichele . ''

		Lectures 011
Dante	PERSON	and readings from his works have been given everywhere this year , and the finest cantos of the ' Commedia ' have even been recited on the stage .

		In fact , the poet has been all the rage , and the natural eloquence , not to say verbosity , of the Italians must have found utterance to the full in this enthusiasm . ''

		The serious works upon Dante include ''
Dante	PERSON	and Heresy , '' by
Sig	ORGANIZATION	.


Felice Tocco	PERSON	; '' La Vita e la Coltura Italian a al Tempo di Dante , '' by various writers , and a further instalment of the work entitled ''
Poesie di Mille Autori	ORGANIZATION	intorno di
Dante Allighieri	PERSON	, '' which , intended to fill twelve volumes , will be '' a complete collection of poems , including those written in imitation of
Dante	LOCATION	, in all languages . ''

		R. de Cesare ; '' Storia d' Italia Contemporanea , '' by
Sig	ORGANIZATION	.

		Paolo
Orsi	PERSON	; and '' II Centre di Firenze , '' a volume issued by the Commune of
Florence	LOCATION	.

		The writer glances in conclusion at the scien - tific output , remarking that '' the archaeological discoveries at
Rome	LOCATION	, the Stele arcaica , the
Oriental Congress	ORGANIZATION	, the
Congress of Christian Archaeology	ORGANIZATION	, the centenaries of
Paulus Diac	ORGANIZATION	- onus and
Francesco Filelf	PERSON	o , the commemoration of the great legal writer
Francesco Carrara	PERSON	, of
Lucca	LOCATION	, and other events , have given rise to many valuable publications . ''

		Senator
D. Comparetti	PERSON	's monograph on the Stele arcaica is particularly noteworthy .

		Of philosophical publications , the most important seem to be '' Le Mostruosita dello
Spirito	PERSON	, '' by
Sig	ORGANIZATION	.

		Ven - turi ; '' Rosmini-Spencer , '' by
Sig	ORGANIZATION	.


G. Vidari	PERSON	; `` Nord e Sud , '' by

F. S. Nitti	PERSON	; and `` II Governo Locale Inglese e le Sue Relazioni con la
Vita Nazionale	PERSON	, '' by
Sig	ORGANIZATION	.


Pietro Bertolini	PERSON	.

		Mr.
C. Brinchmann	PERSON	, writing of Norwegian literature , naturally gives the first place to Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	's '' When We Dead Awake , '' and ac - cepts the sub-title , '' a dramatic epilogue , '' as meaning that this work '' is to be the last link in the chain of ideas that have occupied his mind since * A Doll Home ' appeared . ''


Herr Jonas Lie	PERSON	, like Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	, has chosen an artist 's career for the subject of his this year 's novel . ''

		Both writers seem to have drawn largely on per - sonal experience , their difference of temperament being made clearly evident .

		Where Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	's drama re - veals concentrated self-consciousness coupled with much that is tender ,
Herr Jonas Lie	PERSON	's novel ,
Faste Forland	LOCATION	, ' shows its author 's frank disposition and absolute faith in the eventual triumph of life 's healthy instincts , as clearly as when in his youth , after the usual fate of an inexperienced financial promoter , the inevitable final shock only broke the chrysalis to send forth the novelist .

		And all the best qualities of this delightful narrator show themselves once again in this his latest volume , which would doubtless appeal favorably to many in the country that love
Dickens	PERSON	.

Aug. 16	DATE	, Mr.
Constantine Balmont	PERSON	writes of literary
Russia	LOCATION	in somewhat pessimistic strain .

		Although the past year witnessed the
Pushkin	LOCATION	centenary , '' There did not appear a single book or a single essay worthy of the great poet , and the historical date which should have been the joyful festival of a great people forms another ignominious page in literary chronicles . ''

		Count Tolstoy 's '' Resurrection '' has been the one great work of the year . ''

		It presents a remarkably complicated picture , parts of which may produce a frigid impression upon the spectator , or even shock his feelings , but it is , consid - ered as a whole , a magnificent fresco not to be forgot - ten , and unique .

		It is impossible to express any deep regrets that Count
Leo Tolstoi	PERSON	has not openly given himself up to a purely artistic impulse , as he did in his Homerically great novels '
Anna Karenina	PERSON	' and ' War and Peace . '

		But in spite of all the fatiguing deficien - cies of his improving and sermonizing manner , the new novel shows that
Tolstoi	PERSON	even now , when his life is drawing to a close , may furnish us with types and create effects with all the force of youth .

		The descrip - tion of
spring	DATE	at the beginning of the novel ; the de - scription of the maison publique and the fallen women ; the description of the malodorous prison , which de - pressed even the attendants in it ; the breaking up of the ice ; the autumnal night when the heroine
Katusha	LOCATION	runs after the train in which Nekhludov , who has de - ceived her , is departing ; the various scenes of convict life all these are pictures such as show an artist of the first rank who understands how to be responsive to the most varying demands . ''

		The work of next importance in the year 's lit - erature is ''
Thomas Gordeyev	PERSON	, '' a novel by Mr.
Maxim Gorski	PERSON	. ''

		This novel , which depicts the life of the tradesmen who live about the
Volga	LOCATION	, is as complete and finished as a lyrical poem .

		Mr.
Merezhovski	PERSON	has written '' The

		A certain change is perceptible in the ordinary life of contemporary Russian singers , owing to the circum - stance that a poetical club has been established at
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	, founded by Mr.
K. K. Sluchevski	PERSON	, the best of living Russian poets ; and a company for the publi - cation of books , called the Scorpion , ' has been started at

		Important new editions of the poets Tiutchev and Fet , and of the critic
Bielinski	PERSON	, have been published .

		Among works of scholarship the following should be mentioned : '' Village Economy in Muscovy in the Sixteenth Cen - tury , '' by Mr.

A. Volinski	PERSON	.

		Generally speaking , the writer thinks that `` The season just closed has shown more life than that which preceded it .

		The inevitable separation between 1 fathers ' and ' children ' raises the temperature of jour - nalistic life .

		Unfortunately the opponents of all that is new in literature , seeing almost a mortal sin in the crea - tion of new forms of poetical production , appear to be intellectually flaccid , and greet the constant struggle of ideas with a heap of interjections .

		But youth must be young , and no amount of shrieks can prevent us from celebrating our poetical

		Two GREAT PUBLIC SCHOOLS OF
ENGLAND	LOCATION	.

		* The term Public Schools , in English usage as distinct from American usage , denotes boys ' boarding-schools that fit for the universities These schools are established upon private foundations , and are made free only to a small number of day scholars , called '' foundationers , '' in the town in which they are situated .

		Thus , the public school is merely set off from the private tutor , as when
Thomas Arnold	PERSON	writes that his experience '' seems to point out no one plan of education as decidedly the best ; it only says that public education is the best when it an - swers .

		A very good private tutor would tempt one to try private education ; or a very good public school , with connections with the boys at it , might induce one to venture upon public . ''

		The stories of two of these great English pub - lic schools Rugby and Charterhouse form the subjects of two excellent volumes of a series which is to cover the whole system of the lead - ing public schools of
England	LOCATION	.

		Rugby is treated by the Assistant Master , Mr.
H. C. Bradby	PERSON	, who has , while confessedly giving nothing new , compiled the main facts into a useful sketch .

		Rugby School was founded in
1567	DATE	, '' in ac - cordance with the will of
Lawrence Sheriffe	PERSON	, citizen and grocer of
London	LOCATION	, '' to be a free school '' chiefly for the children of Rugby and Brownsover . ''

		For
the first century	DATE	of its life it had but a precarious existence ; but with
Henry Holyoake	PERSON	, who held the head mastership for forty-three years , from
1687	DATE	to
1731	DATE	, it began a vigorous career .


Thomas James	PERSON	,
Henry Ingles	PERSON	, and
John Wooll	PERSON	were successors of note .

		Of the last named it is recorded that he '' did not forget
Solomon	PERSON	's precept , and we read of one occasion when in the extraordinarily short space of fifteen minutes he flogged the whole of a form of thirty-eight boys , who had thought fit to put a stop to a lesson by the simple expe - dient of going away . ''

		After this redoubtable flogger came the greatest of all masters ,
Thomas Arnold	PERSON	. ''

		What
Arnold	PERSON	did for public schools was to alter and expand , to a degree which amounted to a revolution , the aims and objects which these institutions set before * RUGBY .

		themselves .

		Before his time the avowed object of the public schools was to impart learning ; systems and discipline were subservient to this end , and though inci - dentally they had other effects , their main object was to render learning possible and effective ; if this object was attained their work was done , and they were judged by their success or failure in this respect .

		Arnold took a much broader view of the objects of education ; while deeply impressed with the importance of learning , he realized that it was only a part of education , and that the great end and aim of education was the formation of character .

		This was the great object which was to domi - nate all others : to this end learning and everything else must be subservient .

		The ideal which he set before himself was to train boys to become not merely scholars but Christian gentlemen ... He accepted the two great features of English public schools , the liberty allowed to all , and the power exercised by the senior over the junior boys ; but he bent all his energies to bring it about that the liberty should not be mere license , and that the power should be exercised for good and not for evil , as had been too often the case .

		... Arnold 's greatness and his success lay in the fact that he did inspire a very large proportion of boys placed in authority with something of his own spirit of duty , and that in the minds even of boys who did not come into personal contact with him he implanted a feeling of their responsibility as members of a great society .

		In this way he did succeed in showing what a public school , in spite of its imperfections , might , ' to use his own phrase , ' and ought to be . '

		He did succeed in rousing people to the fact that the aim of education was not merely to stimulate the intellectual faculties but the moral faculties as well , that the great object to be pursued was the formation of character .

		In this he was a pioneer , and his example soon had great results . ''

		The most noted men of letters who have come from
Rugby	ORGANIZATION	are
Walter Savage Landor	ORGANIZATION	,
A. H. Clough	PERSON	, and
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	.

		Lander 's independent and fiery personality displayed itself at Rugby as in all his later life .

		When the head master knocked at his door , his only reply was , '' Get thee hence , Satan ! ''

		and '' it was for writing scurrillous verses in the head master 's album that that strange genius had finally to be removed . ''

		Lander 's name is linked with Rugby by the lines on ' The Swift joining the Avon , '' just as
Arnold	LOCATION	's is by his great poem on '' Rugby Chapel . ''


Thomas Hughes	PERSON	, who has been described as '' the incar - nation of the highest form of the British school - boy , the best type of the character of the school which moulded him , '' has immortalized Rugby scenes in ''
Tom Brown	PERSON	's Schooldays . ''

		The second chapter of this book gives a detailed description of the buildings and grounds .

		A large and well-equipped art mu - seum is an unusual feature in a boy 's school , but it seems very serviceable at Rugby .

		The third chapter gives a brief account of the work of the school , while the fourth is devoted to societies , games , etc. .

		Several pages are given 94 THE DIAL , -LSB-

		Charterhouse , though not so familiar a name as
Rugby	LOCATION	, is one of the great and venerable English public schools .

		It dates from
1609	DATE	, and was founded by
Thomas Sutton	PERSON	, a banker of
London	LOCATION	.

		The name
Charterhouse	ORGANIZATION	is a cor - rupt form of '' Chartreuse , '' it being situated on the site of '' L'Abbaye Chartreuse '' at
Smithfield	ORGANIZATION	; and hence the name
Charterhouse	ORGANIZATION	is properly spelled as one word , and members of the school are known as '' Carthusians . ''

		By the
Chantry Acts of Henry VIII	ORGANIZATION	.

		and
Edward VI.	ORGANIZATION	, a large number of grammar schools where Latin had been taught were done away with . ''

		Now Latin was then the universal language of in - ternational commerce .

		Knowledge of Latin at that time was as necessary for foreign commerce as a knowledge of French and German is now .


Sutton	PERSON	, a man of business in many lands , must have felt that his countrymen , who were losing their Latin , were at a disadvantage in commerce , just as boys who neglect modern languages are at the present time .

		So in founding a grammar school
Sutton	PERSON	was founding the equivalent of a modern technical school . ''

		Charterhouse can not count so distinguished a line of masters as Rugby .

		One of the early masters ,
Robert Brooke	PERSON	, '' was ejected for flog - ging boys who did not share his political views . ''

		Dr.
Russell	PERSON	, who was head master in the early part of this century , abolished flog - ging , and substituted fines , to the indignation of the boys who regarded flogging '' as very gentlemanly , but fines most ungentlemanly . ''

		The rebellion against fines was so fierce that Dr.
Russell	PERSON	re-adopted flogging , and one of the students of the times writes that on the day when fines were abolished , '' when we all walked into school together , we found a per - fect forest of birch rods , and I should think that the whole school-time of two hours was expended in the use and application of them ! ''

		The rod is now rarely used at
Charterhouse	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the realm of letters ,
Thackeray	PERSON	was the most distinguished son of Charterhouse , and he shows in his writings a devoted attachment to the school .

		In
1872	DATE	Charterhouse was removed from
London	LOCATION	to new buildings at
Godalming	LOCATION	.

		give accounts of the varied life there , work , plays , discipline , manners , prizes , expenses , etc. .

		Charterhouse , like other public schools , has been greatly hu - manized in the last few decades ; legalized fighting and the worse forms of bullying have been suppressed , and the power of the monitor over the fag has been restricted .

		It is also notable that now in this school , where , as in other schools , athleticism has been dominant , '' intellectual pursuits are regarded with toler - ance '' ; the scholarly boy is no longer subject to constant persecution .

		Another change at
Charterhouse	ORGANIZATION	is one which does not meet with the unlimited approval of the author namely , the mapping out of the boy 's leisure time by set games and entertainments , so that he no longer has time fully to himself to act upon his own initiative .

		`` There does appear a distinct danger of public schools becoming more and more what they are some - times said to be , ' the home of the commonplace . '

		Hitherto their tradition has been to encourage manliness , self-reliance , independence , and a high sense of duty ; the monitorial system taught all , first how to obey , and afterwards how to command , while the unrestricted life fostered originality and self-reliance .

		What will be the results of the present method , time must show . ''

		These little handbooks are compends of in - formation , and are presumably meant more to be consulted than to be read .

		However , they are clearly written and well illustrated , and will be of considerable interest to the general reader , and of special interest to the educator , the tourist , the alumnus , and the patron .

		THE DIAL 95 lutions .

		After some consideration of the pre - liminary questions that later became important in the settlement of the
Texas	LOCATION	and
Oregon	LOCATION	problems , an extended chapter deals with the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	, tracing its history up to the time when it was formulated by the President whose name it bears , the occasion which called it forth being indicated at length .

		The history of the
Holy Alliance	ORGANIZATION	is so related as to show how a '' meaningless pledge '' of
1815	DATE	, framed in a moment of religious excitement , led the allied rulers into a position where they were forced to oppose all popular government , until at Aix-la-Chapelle in
1818	DATE	they became organ - ized into a mutual association for the insurance of monarchy .

		This chapter is a fair type of the volume , which is largely taken up with essays descriptive of the development of ideas in the
United States	LOCATION	, essays on Socialistic and
Labor Reforms	ORGANIZATION	, on the Negro Problem , the Industrial Revolution , Early Literature , Brit - ish Criticism of the
United States	LOCATION	, the Com - mon School in the
First Half Century	ORGANIZATION	, and Political Ideas in the
First Half Century	ORGANIZATION	.

		These essays lead up to the surprisingly rapid changes of the period under consideration , and in many instances the interplay of forces is admirably , if perhaps unconsciously , indicated .

		The account is very interesting of the agitation by laboring men for a shorter day , of the influ - ence upon labor and society of the invention and introduction of labor-saving machinery , of the preaching of doctrines of social betterment with the accompaniment of the formation of communities for the working out of theories .

		Men are taught the wisdom of cutting loose from old party ties , and the attractiveness of the anti-masonic party is in a measure under - stood as people look to see the new leader or the most likely new theory .

		The beginnings of the importance of urban life are noted in such striking paragraphs as this : '' At
New York	LOCATION	, now the metropolis of the country , the growth of the city was astonishing to its own citi - zens .

		The population numbered one hundred and sixty - two thousand , an increase of forty thousand in five years .

		To keep pace with such an inpouring of strang - ers was hardly possible .

		More than three thousand buildings were under way in
1825	DATE	, yet such was the press that not an unoccupied dwelling house existed in the entire city , and it was quite common to see families living in houses with unfinished floors , with windows destitute of sashes , and in which the carpenters had not hung a single door .

		Nor was this an accident .

		Year after year the same thing occurred , and on one first of
May	DATE	the great ' moving day ' three hundred home - less people gathered in the park with their household goods and were lodged in the jail till the houses they had rented were finished and made habitable . ''

		The same activity was indicated in business circles as in domestic . ''

		Five hundred new mercantile houses were said to have been established in the city in the
early months of 1825	DATE	, a statement well borne out by the crowded con - dition of the mercantile newspapers .

		The ' Gazette ' in seven days contained 1,115 new advertisements , and in one issue , a week later , printed 213 , and stated that 23 others were left out for want of space . ''

		The lack of preparation of the people for the rapid changes can hardly be better indicated than by mention of a newspaper which would let twenty-three advertisements escape it be - cause of '' want of space . ''

		As another indica - tion , it may be mentioned that of the three thousand dwellings reported as building in
1825	DATE	, it is related that , '' Most of these houses were built by speculators , and were erected so cheaply and hastily that several fell down while in course of construction ; others were torn down by order of the authorities . ''

		The attempts of the citizens to wrestle with the new problems of city life naturally were extremely faulty .

		The cleaning of the streets , the protection from fire and from evil doers , the lighting of streets and houses , caused the residents of the new cities just as much trouble as they do people of to-day , and , as presented by Mr.
McMaster	PERSON	, stand in suggestive opposi - tion to the difficulties of rural life , where vast sums were spent in schemes for the improve - ment of transportation , and thousands of dollars were buried in connection with efforts to solve problems in which highway and canal and rail - road figured largely .

		The questions of the city and the country differed materially , but in each place the same characteristics marked the period , the temptation to deal in futures , a wild rush for speculation , an abundance of cheap money , social distress , relief laws , then a gradual settling down on a firmer and steadier basis .

		The changes which were taking place in political ideas were as numerous and as marked as those in the field of social life .

		New and more liberal constitutions were adopted , grant - ing a wider suffrage and more generous privi - leges .

		Ideas advanced in theory as part of the revolutionary movement became realized in fact .

		A number of perplexing and puzzling problems presented themselves for solution , the status of the free negro , the quieting of Indian titles -LRB- notably in
Georgia	LOCATION	-RRB- , the ever important matter of slavery extension , the ac - tual working of tariff provisions .

		Put these with an occasional diplomatic question , the
Panama Congress	ORGANIZATION	, the settlement of the dis -

Maine	LOCATION	boundary , the future of
Oregon	LOCATION	, the possibilities in the direction of
Texas	LOCATION	, and one has the panorama passing before him , which Mr.
McMaster	PERSON	has successfully de - scribed .

		The political history in the volume is com - paratively unimportant .

		The discussion of the problems mentioned everywhere dominates .

		But a word must be said of the account of the development of the `` Jackson men , '' and the attractiveness of the study of the machinery of popular elections which was being formed in opposition to the congressional caucus .

		Why it was that
Jackson	PERSON	had such a hold upon the common people will certainly be clearer to anyone after reading Mr.
McMaster	PERSON	's story .

		In mechanical construction this volume , which is the smallest of the five in the series , reveals the haste in which it was printed , a haste which is apparent notwithstanding the length of time of the publishers ' preliminary announcements of '' ready soon '' and '' in press , '' promises for whose fulfilment eager students waited long .

		Careful proof-reading would have prevented such mistakes as '' Nile 's Register '' -LRB- p. 7 -RRB- , ``

Washinton	LOCATION	'' -LRB- p. 24 -RRB- , `` the French ... was about to invade and seize
Cuba	LOCATION	'' -LRB- p. 53 -RRB- .

		A little care might have avoided anachronisms in maps , as in the one on page 121 , where the
United States	LOCATION	in
1826	DATE	is shown with one of the lines marked `` confirmed by
Mexico	LOCATION	in
1828	DATE	. ''

		The same map indicates the line of 54 40 ' as being quite a distance north of the line of 55 .

		important books have appeared ,
Keane	PERSON	's '' Man , Past and Present , ''
Ripley	PERSON	's '' Races of

		The author is Librarian at the
Museum of Natural History	ORGANIZATION	in
Paris	LOCATION	, and has long been prominent in the anthropological work of
France	LOCATION	.

		The alternative title , '' An Outline of An - thropology and Ethnology , '' gives a fair idea of the scope of the work .

		The first seven chap - ters study the characters investigated by an - thropologists the Somatic -LRB- Morphological , Physiological , and Pathological -RRB- , the Ethnic -LRB- including Linguistic -RRB- , and Sociological -LRB- Ma - terial Life , Psychic Life , Family Life , and Social Life -RRB- characters .

		Attention is then turned to Systematic Ethnology .

		In one chapter the matter of Classification of Races and Peo - ples is presented .

		The method of defining races by the synthesis of a few fundamental somato - logical characters , carefully examined and traced out through humanity , was first fully carried out by Topinard , who thus defined nine - teen original races .

		Deniker pursues the same method , but makes out and names twenty-nine races .

		These are succinctly described .

		In grouping these in a table , the author considers the hair as a fundamental character for sub - division purposes and recognizes six groups : -LRB- A -RRB- Woolly hair , broad nose -LRB- four types -RRB- ; -LRB- B -RRB- Curly hair or wavy -LRB- four types -RRB- ; -LRB- C -RRB- Wavy brown or black hair , dark eyes -LRB- seven types -RRB- ; -LRB- D -RRB- Fair , wavy or straight hair , light eyes -LRB- two types -RRB- ; -LRB- E -RRB- Straight or wavy hair , dark , black eyes -LRB- four types -RRB- ; -LRB- F -RRB- Straight hair -LRB- eight types -RRB- .

		These twenty-nine race - types , when grouped to show relationship , give rise to some seventeen new groups which are characterized and then rather unsatisfactorily arranged in a two-dimension tabulation .

		The author next examines the distribution of these races and groups , taking up five great world divisions in the following order :
Europe	LOCATION	,
Asia	LOCATION	,
Africa	LOCATION	,
Oceania	LOCATION	,
America	LOCATION	.

		He is every - where exact and rigid , laying down hard and fast lines .

		There is no doubt or uncertainty in his statements , no controversies or difficulties .

		Here we have such and such types , pure or unmixed ; there we find such and such a com - bination .

		The author is undoubtedly too arbi - trary , yet some degree of arbitrariness is inher - ent in the nature of such a treatise .

		It is best , perhaps , to admit his assumptions ; but we ought always to remember that all types have not yet been finally marked out , and that many conclu - sions here presented will surely be modified .

		1900 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 97 It is fair to say , however , that the author has read widely and has carefully weighed his reading .

		Interest naturally centres in
Deniker	LOCATION	's treat - ment of the populations of
Europe	LOCATION	, a subject which has engaged his attention for years , and upon which he is high authority .

		It will be remembered that Dr.
Ripley	PERSON	, whose book we recently noticed in these columns , claimed but three European types
Mediterranean	LOCATION	,
Alpine	LOCATION	, Teutonic .

		It was a view ideally simple and attractive .

		Deniker recognizes six principal and four secondary races .

		Two of his six principal races are fair-haired , four are dark - haired .

		The six principal races are
the Northern	ORGANIZATION	,
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	, Ibero-insular , Western or Cevenole , Littoral or Atlanto-Mediterranean ,
Adriatic	LOCATION	or Dinaric .

		Each of these is described and the influence of each in the present popu - lations examined .

		On the whole , without claiming for it inerrancy , Deniker 's classifica - tion better suits us than
Ripley 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		In his dis - cussion of each world district , the author first presents an outline of the prehistoric evidence regarding past populations , and then discusses those of the present .

		We always read , with great satisfaction , the discussions , in these general treatises , of those areas with which we are least familiar .

		It is only when we read those dealing with ground most familiar to us that we become doubtful and hesitant .

		Where in the large list of
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- ropean writers have we a discussion of American ethnologic problems that is half-way satisfac - tory ?

		Peschel fell far short .

		Eatzel ,
Schmidt	PERSON	,
Keane	PERSON	,
Nadaillac	LOCATION	, always just fail to grasp re - lations and bearings .

		Deniker does little better .

		The realization of this failure in the field we best know always leaves a haunting dread lest other fields may be as bad .

		Let us hope not .

		A word of criticism must be made either of the translator or proof-reader of this book .

		The statement that there are but two thousand Livonians is almost as startling as that the English lung capacity is 3.7 cubic metres .

		One of the best features of the book is its series of tables of measurements ; but unless their proof - reading has been done with great care their value is gone .

		RECENT BOOKS ON EDUCATION .

		* Perhaps the most significant of the recent an - nouncements of educational publications is that of the '' Teacher 's Professional Library , '' edited by Dr.
Nicholas Murray Butler	PERSON	and published by the
Macmillan Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		The published list contains books on the various studies of the secondary schools , to be written by favorably known teachers .

		That the editor and publishers should venture on so extensive an enterprise speaks well for the educational intelli - gence and interest of the country , at least as these gentlemen view matters .

		They evidently expect teachers and scholars to respond liberally to their enterprise , and it is to be hoped that they will do so .

		It fell to the lot of Dr.
D. E. Smith	PERSON	, of the
Brockport	LOCATION	,
N. Y.	PERSON	,
Normal School	ORGANIZATION	, to open the series , which he has done in a commendable way in his '' Teaching of Elementary Mathematics . ''

		If the opinion which is held in some quarters to the effect that of late the teaching of mathematics has suffered in the atten - tion that it has received in comparison with some other subjects , this volume will do something to re - dress the balance .

		Again , one of the serious educa - tional questions of the time is , What parts of math - ematics shall be taught in the elementary schools ?

		One of the merits of the book is that it will help to find a practical answer to this question .

		For ex - ample , Dr.
Smith	PERSON	's criticisms on the current arith - metic and suggestions of reform are thoroughly sensible and judicious .

		The author considers his three main subjects , arithmetic , algebra , and geom - etry , under the four aspects : nature of the study , educational value , history , and method , handling them in a manner that the great majority of teach - * THB TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS .

		98 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, ers for whom the book is intended can not fail to find illuminating and helpful .

		Our severest criti - cism of the book is that the author has not always distributed his matter in as clear and logical a way as he might have done .

		The mechanical make-up and appearance of the volume are excellent .

		Professor
H. B. Adams	PERSON	gives in '' Public Educa - tional Work in
Baltimore	LOCATION	'' an interesting account of such work done since
1876	DATE	by or under the aus - pices of the
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a good contribution to the literature of
University Extension	ORGANIZATION	, although the work that is treated has not always , or generally , borne that name .

		A be - ginning was made before
University Extension	ORGANIZATION	had been introduced into the country ; moreover , the claim is made that the first conscious attempt to introduce English university methods into this coun - try were made in
1887	DATE	by individuals connected with
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	.

		The monograph closes with an inter - esting but rather strained attempt to find educational meaning in
Washington	LOCATION	's relations to
Baltimore	LOCATION	.

		When the first reports of the
University Ele	ORGANIZATION	- mentary
School of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	reached the outside world , they were not taken seriously save by isolated persons here and there .

		It was not anticipated by teachers and educators generally that the school would last long , or that it would teach any important lessons , save one very old lesson that has been so many times repeated that an additional repetition can hardly make it more impressive .

		But to the surprise of persons holding this view , the school has lived on until it is now in its fourth year , and has more eyes fixed upon it to-day , undoubtedly , than any other elementary school in the country .

		This fact must be admitted , but just what may be its significance is a question that would call out a diversity of answers .

		In our view its meaning will be found in large part , but not wholly , in current dissatisfaction with our conventional common school education , and desire to find something better .

		Although considerable has been written about this school , we have not had hitherto an authorized statement of its aims and methods .

		This lack is now supplied by Professor
Dewey	PERSON	, the author of the school , in his book entitled '' The School and So - ciety . ''

		This volume consists of three lectures '' sup - plemented by a statement of the
University	ORGANIZATION	school , '' the whole comprehending but one hundred and twenty-five pages .

		But small as it is , it is not impossible that the book will come to hold some such prominence among the pedagogical books of the time as the school itself is now holding among the schools of the country .

		The central ideas of the three lectures are that the school has entirely failed to keep pace with social progress , and must be readjusted to society ; that , owing in great part to this failure , the school has fallen out of relation to the life of the child and must in some way be brought back into such relation , and that , as a re - sult of these two facts , there is now great waste in education going on .

		Furthermore , the readjust - ment of the school to society and to child-life can - not be effected on the lines of reconstructed scholas - ticism or a new course of study , but must be accomplished on the lines of manual training , cook - ing , sewing , drawing , modelling , and the other '' fads and frills '' which call down the wrath of educational , conservatives .

		While no one can tell what the future of the
University Elementary School	ORGANIZATION	may be , it does not require much foresight to see that it can never become the type of the public elementary school : its cost and the delicacy of the organization make this impossible .

		But it would be a great mistake to identify the fortunes of the book and the fortunes of the school .

		The book has virtue , no matter what the future of the school may be .

		It is to be hoped , therefore , that teachers will be more interested in making some practical application of this virtue to the schools of the country than in watching the develop - ment of the little institution in
Chicago	LOCATION	that was the occasion of this virtue obtaining literary expression .

		It was perfectly natural that the promoters of the Ethical Culture movement should impress the
Sunday	DATE	school into their service , and that they should begin to produce a
Sunday	DATE	School literature .

		Still , so far as we are aware , Mr.
Sheldon	PERSON	's '' An Ethical
Sunday	DATE	School '' is the first essay in that direction .

		The book has , however , other sources of interest .

		The distinction between the new type of school and the old one is thus expressed : '' We desire that all that sanctity which in the con - ventional
Sunday	DATE	school has been connected with the word God ' should surround the thought of the Moral Law .

		It is the Moral Law which should sanctify the thought of God , rather than the thought of God which should sanctify the Moral Law . ''

		We are told further that the aim is '' To associate the sentiments belonging to the Eternal , the Infinite , the Absolute , with the distinction between right and wrong , with the thought of the Moral Law , but not to use these words so that they shall become hackneyed before the child-mind has begun to have any conception at all as to what these words stand for . ''

		We do not propose to discuss the new ideal , or even to give an account of the modus by which it is pro- posed to realize it .

		On the latter point , the author tells us that his book is a description of the system of
Sunday	DATE	School work that has been developed in an
Ethical Sunday School	ORGANIZATION	in
St. Louis	LOCATION	.

		He has evidently devoted much time and thought to the subject , and his work may , in our opinion , be read with advantage by the managers and teachers of conventional
Sunday	DATE	Schools .

		They may get from it some useful ideas of method and of systematic instruction , if nothing more .

		For ourselves , we think there is a valuable suggestion in the statement : `` We undertake to develop certain tendencies of thought and feeling in the young , or to develop a cer - tain attitude of mind on the problems of life , rather than to give the young a specific knowledge or to impart definite beliefs or facts of scriptural history . '' ''

		Educational Aims and Methods , '' by the veteran English educator , Sir
Joshua Fitch	PERSON	, will naturally attract the attention of the better class of American
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL teachers , to whom he is so favorably known .

		These teachers will desire no other recommendation of the book than that it is , in a sense , supplementary to the author 's well-known '' Lectures on Teaching , '' which has been republished by more than one American house .

		The volume is composed of lec - tures and addresses that have been given at various times within the last few years before different audiences in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	.

		These dis - courses treat of miscellaneous subjects , so that the book has no distinct centre of unity .

		The subjects dealt with lie in '' the borderland '' which '' separates the corporate life of the school from the larger life of the family and the community , '' as Sir
Joshua	PERSON	puts it , and are all interesting and important .

		The book contains fifteen lectures and addresses .

		That veteran educator of the
Pacific Coast	LOCATION	, Mr.
John Sweet	PERSON	, has made a useful contribution to the literature of the profession that he has honored , in '' American Public Schools . ''

		The peculiar feature of the book is that it is made up in something like equal measure of history and pedagogics ; a combi - nation for which , in the case of the great majority of teachers , much can be said .

		To this class of persons the volume may be strongly recommended .

		Professor
MacCunn	PERSON	's '' The Making of Charac - ter '' is a valuable addition to the literature of moral training .

		The book covers a wide field of topics , and covers it well and wisely .

		Incalculably more valuable than intellectual training , moral training , in its nature , processes , and methods , if not in its results , is yet much less understood .

		There is , indeed , an extensive literature of moral counsel and exhortation , some of it of great value ; but there is a great lack of a body of definite and practical teach - ing , or a moral pedagogy , that teachers can use .

		This book is not just the book that is most needed , but it will do something to supply that need .

		It abounds in quotable passages . ''

		Reading : How to Teach It , '' by
Sarah Louise Arnold	PERSON	, Supervisor of Schools of
Boston	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, is one of the most attractive and sensible books that has appeared on the subject in many a day .

		In choice of matter and in method of presentation it is thoroughly practical and exceedingly suggestive , its key-note being a setting forth of the best methods of teaching a pupil how to read and what to read , and of creating within him a permanent love for choicest reading .

		Every page shows the masterful author and the experienced supervisor .

		It is a fine contri - bution to this important branch of learning , and should be welcomed by every teacher of reading .

		We predict for it a large sale .

		`` Advanced Elementary Science '' is the latest volume in the `` International Education Series . ''

		It is by Professor
Edward Howe	PERSON	, author of '' Sys - tematic Science Teaching , '' and is intended to pro- vide symmetrical outlines for grammar grades similar to those therein provided for primary grades .

		The book treats of the elements of botany , zoology , geology , mineralogy , and astronomy , and offers rich suggestions and illustrations of the best methods of presentation to pupils .

		The aim of the work , like that of its fore-runner , is the cultivation of accurate habits of observation , the acquirement of common facts , and the establishment of proper apperception bases for future scientific instruction .

		It will be ex - ceedingly helpful to the great mass of teachers in this field of work , and should receive a warm welcome . ''

		The
Logical Bases of Education	ORGANIZATION	, '' by
J. Welton	PERSON	, Professor of Education in the
Yorkshire College	LOCATION	,
Victoria University	ORGANIZATION	, is well written , thoughtful , and scholarly , and aims to point out a system of instruc - tion whereby logical habits of thinking and study can best be developed .

		It is , however , too far be - yond the grasp of the ordinary teacher to attract serious attention , or to be of much value as an edu - cational contribution .

		It could wisely be denomi - nated a Logic , and placed in that particular field .

		Mr.
Seeley	PERSON	's '' A History of Education '' is de - signed especially for teachers preparing for exam - ination .

		The book is not based on theory , has no logical beginning or ending , makes no claim to thoroughness , but aims to furnish plain , accurate material of sufficient comprehensiveness to meet the demands of all reasonable examining boards .

		Professor
F. E. Bolton	PERSON	's '' Secondary School Sys - tem of
Germany	LOCATION	'' is a very interesting volume .

		The book is the outcome of a year 's residence de - voted to an examination of the school system and to a study of the underlying principles involved .

		It treats in a very clear and concise manner of the general organization and management of the schools , the status of the teacher , the course of study , the higher education of women , and of many other topics of special interest and value to American students .

		The author is especially happy in depict - ing those very features of the system which the average educator is most anxious to know about .

		The author is also unique in that he does not fall down and worship at the German educational shrine as so many are wont to do , but is as quick to por - tray their defects as their excellences .

		The book is a valuable contribution to the literature on this sub - ject , and should be extensively read . ''

		The Nervous System of the Child , '' by
Francis Warner	PERSON	,
M.D.	LOCATION	, author of '' The Study of School Children and their Training , '' is clear , comprehen - sive , and scientific , and is the result of long study and practice as teacher and physician .

		It treats of the following topics : the brain and body in infancy and early childhood ; the child at school ; observa - tion , description , and classification of children in school ; evolution of the child and his brain power ; physical care of the child , hygiene and feeding ; the training and teaching of young children ; advancing school method and teaching ; the nerve centres in infancy school life and adolescence , their health and training ; and mental hygiene and voluntary mental power .

		In view of the wide-spread interest in every - thing that pertains to the welfare of the child , these topics ought to prove of unusual interest to teachers and to the public generally .

		100 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		It is more than half a generation .

		since a few scientific men , to whom the situation had become an increas - ingly grave one , formed in
Washington	LOCATION	`` The
American Forestry Association	ORGANIZATION	, '' which has long labored under all the disadvantages pertaining to any movement the need of which is unrecognized by the people at large .

		When an American fron - tiersman sees a tree at any rate , on land over which he has any control he cuts it down .

		That is part of the instinct of clearing the ground for work .

		But the American lumberman has cleared it simply for profit , with no knowledge that thus he was creating inevitably not only arid lands , but dis - ease and other unpleasant conditions .

		Our forests have vanished not only before the axe and the gen - eral march of what we call civilization , but by the fires of yearly recurrence .

		Even now , as these words are written , the most glorious trees eye of man in this country has ever rested upon the redwoods of
California	LOCATION	are at the mercy of a lumber corporation , and the women of
California	LOCATION	are cogitating what to do about it .

		In short , while the meaning of a tree is becoming a trifle clearer to the general mind , we need all the education that can be given , in school and out , to fix the fact that man can not make a tree , and that its destruction save for essential purposes is a crime .

		In good time , then , comes an admirable manual for just such ends , '' North American Forests and For - estry , '' by an expert , Mr.
Ernest Bruncken	PERSON	of the
Wisconsin Forestry Commission	ORGANIZATION	; his German name not only implying but insuring the patient , careful , indefatigable work that is evident in every page of the volume .

		The twelve chapters , with their full table of contents and index , mean a book that should be on the shelves of every lover of trees , and no less on those of every householder in city or country , since to act as it directs is now a recog - nized duty of the citizen .

		Waste is an American vice , waste of food , of material in a thousand ways , of life itself , in our hurry and rush .

		There is no need of surprise , but there is surely need for shame , as we read the story of our own wholesale destruction of what we have the right to use as a gift of nature , but never the right to waste or reck - lessly destroy .

		The book pleads for general educa - tion in this study , not alone for the personal knowl - edge and its pleasure , but as a national necessity , and it makes all the reasons plain .

		Mr.
Bruncken	PERSON	's work is clear , definite , practical , above all in its definition of what Forestry really is , and the clear - est of statements as to what deforestation means in the life of the people .

		The final chapter , '' Forestry as a Profession , '' opens up a new place in life for many a nature lover , and is as thoroughly common - sense as are other suggestions .

		The book is not a technical manual , save as some technicalities are a necessary part of the presentation .

		It is a very live , very earnest statement of needs , as well as a story of Forestry at home and abroad ; and every school that keeps Arbor Day should have it on the school library shelves , as motive and reason for the custom that
Arbor Day	ORGANIZATION	is at last making a national matter .

		The book is published by the Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	.

		The bright side '' The Story of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	' -RSB- -LRB- Amer - of the story of ican
Hook Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Miss Lillian lone
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		Rhoades , is intended for use as a text-book in the public schools of that city , as an aid to '' the training of pupils to intelligent and virtu - ous citizenship . ''

		The work is a good one for the purpose , so far as it goes , but it seems to us to go scarcely half way .

		It has apparently been prepared on the theory that the training aimed at is to be got by the pupil through the contemplation of the virtues and achievements of a historic past , without study of the municipal needs , conditions , and short - comings of the immediate past and the present .

		An ideal text-book of the kind for the young
Phila	LOCATION	- delphian would , we should think , display also the reverse side , so to speak , of the medal , and thus serve to foster not only a due sense of pride in the glories of the remoter past , but a knowledge of present-day abuses and deficiencies , and a deter - mination to remedy them .

		A keen realization of the mortifying fact that the city of
Penn	LOCATION	and
Franklin	PERSON	, the Mecca of pilgrims to the shrine of American independence , had sunk , through the supineness of her citizens , into a notorious citadel of '' bossism '' and municipal corruption , might well prove even more useful in the arena of political action to the young Philadelphian than a thorough familiarity with the historical springs of civic self - complacency interestingly set forth by
Miss Rhoades	PERSON	in the present volume .

		Indeed , to go farther , we are inclined to think that American youth in gen - eral has lost not a little in point of political judg - ment and efficiency through the vainglorious or un - critical historical text-book , which , in drawing up our national account , has unduly ignored the debit side of the ledger .

		Miss
Rhoades	PERSON	's little book , how - ever , is , we repeat , good so far as it goes , and re - capitulates pleasantly , in a series of brief special chapters , a story the chief features of which should be familiar to every young American .

		Mr.
Edward Brooks	PERSON	, Superintendent of the
Philadelphia	LOCATION	public schools , supplies a brief introduction , and there is a liberal sprinkling of illustrations .

		Dr.
John Bascom	PERSON	has drawn , in his latest volume '' Growth of Nation - ality in the United States '' -LRB- Put - nam -RRB- , from a course of lectures on the
Federal Constitution	ORGANIZATION	, some chapters illustrating the country 's development under that Constitution out of scattered colonies into a compact whole .

		Traces of prepara - tion for the class-room appear everywhere , with occasional infelicities of style ; yet the reader can easily overlook these , along with a general heavi - ness in the treatment , if he is assisted to understand such political phenomena as the willingness of John The growth of
Nationality	ORGANIZATION	.

		THE DIAL , 101
Jay	PERSON	, a century ago , to give up the unique office of Chief Justice of the
United States	LOCATION	in order to be Governor of
New York	LOCATION	.

		The tendency to nation - ality , in this '' social study , '' is accepted as inher - ent , only interrupted by obstacles which it in time overcame : diversity in origin of the different colo - nies ; distance in miles , in cost and time of com - munication , with consequent scanty intercourse and diverging interests ; cessation of the need , with the conclusion of peace , of union for defense ; rivalry of States with one another , of States with the gen - eral government , and between departments of gov - ernment ; and the social fusion of class and class .

		These obstacles give titles to successive chapters in which progress toward union is noted , the steps being marked mainly by decisions of the
national Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	in its slow but effective work of establishing a closer
Federal Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is under the last head , '' Strife between Classes , '' that the author will be most likely to meet with criticism ; his pronounced views on the relation of the
State	ORGANIZATION	to corporations , on railroads and the Inter-State Com - merce
Commission	ORGANIZATION	, on '' government by injunction , '' and the income tax , being not only opposed to those of many respected fellow-citizens , but chargeable also with having no close necessary logical relation with the development of his subject .

		On these points , however , he is fair and sincere : while the motif of this chapter , '' The prosperity of a people can no longer be defined in terms of wealth merely , or civilization that attaches to classes ; it must be defined in terms which express the common social welfare , and run through the body of the nation , '' stands quite above criticism .

		The slavery contro - versy fills its due space in the history , its decision resting on immutable decree : '' The impossibility of successfully compromising a moral question lies in the fact that Ethical Law is a vital issue , inter - lacing all social facts , '' etc. .

		Not only is this the best of lessons for the instruction of a class of undergraduates , but it is one which many of the nation 's legislators might , now no less than
fifty years ago	DATE	, be the better for taking to heart .

		A good analytical table of contents and a useful list of fifty-six '' cases cited '' from
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	reports are provided .

		Readable '' ^ ke Memoirs of the
Baroness Cecile	PERSON	if apocryphal , de
Courtot	PERSON	, Lady in Waiting to the memoir , .

		Princess de Lamballe , Compiled from the Letters of the
Baroness	LOCATION	to
Frau von Alvensleben	PERSON	, and the Diary of the latter by her great grandson ,
Moritz von Kaisenberg	PERSON	, '' is the reading of the title page of an outwardly attractive book recently trans - lated from the German and issued by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the preface the editor relates how he found one day , at the bottom of an an - cient oak chest belonging to the heirlooms of his family , a packet of letters tied with the usual blue ribbon , and a red velvet album containing a diary which proved to be a veritable treasure trove , and whose translation from the original French , together with editorial matter , furnish the contents of the present volume .

		Briefly told , the contents are as follows : The editor gives the Vorgeschichte of the von Alvenslebens , an exemplary noble Prussian pair , who receive the Emigre'e
Baroness de Courtot	PERSON	into their family ; the
Baroness	PERSON	on several succeeding days relates her story up-to-date , which her hostess immediately writes down in the words of the nar - rator in the red album ; the
Baroness	PERSON	resides eight years with the
von Alvenslebens	PERSON	, the record of which is furnished by the album ; she returns to
France	LOCATION	, whence she writes seventeen long letters to ' her benefactors , which are translated in full .

		The en - tire book gives the impression of unreality .

		The marvellous rescue of the heroine from the guillotine ` by her lover ; her recognition of Napoleon at their first interview as the pale-faced cadet who had once rescued her from a mad bull when she was walking under the shade of a red parasol in the fields near
Brienne	LOCATION	, and whom she had afterwards crowned with a wreath of laurel leaves at the distribution of prizes at its Military College ; the return of the supposedly dead lover as a famous soldier , all this and much more of the same kind bears the appearance of ro - mance .

		There is also a striking similarity of style in the parts supplied by the editor , the diary , and the letters .

		If the letters and diary are not genuine , the intimate knowledge of millinery and housekeep - ing displayed would preclude masculine authorship , nor would an author of the male sex people his pages with so many sweet friends , dear princesses , and dear old uncles and pastors .

		But however this may be , the book is a good one to add to the list of light
summer	DATE	reading .

		In its original form , when first pub - lislied ten years ago ,
Captain S. Eardley-Wilmot	PERSON	's `` Our Fleet To - day '' was a review in outline of the changes that had taken place in the principal fleets of the world during the preceding half-century , mainly , of course , in the navy of
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		Naval archi - tecture develops apace , and maritime nations have during the past decade been adding with feverish haste to their strength .

		A new and powerful navy has arisen in the
East	LOCATION	, and
America	LOCATION	has recently startled the world with an unexpected proof of the strength and efficiency of her rehabilitated fleet .

		The Chino - Japanese War and the
Hispano	LOCATION	- American War have furnished many subsidiary lessons in equipment , structural details , and organization .

		Captain Eardley-Wilmot has therefore seen fit to revise and to a considerable extent recast his book , with a view of bringing it up to date , and it is now re-issued in attractive form with some important alterations and additions -LRB-
Scribners	ORGANIZATION	' importation -RRB- .

		In order to keep the volume within the space limits originally assigned to it , the chapters on foreign navies are omitted from the new edition , which is generally restricted to a history of the development of the British fleet from
1840	DATE	to the present day , a period which includes the radical changes from sail oj naval architecture .

		102 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, to steam , wood to iron , and smooth-bore guns to rifled ordnance , `` quick firers , '' and torpedoes .

		Brief accounts of the wars between
China	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	, and the
United States	LOCATION	and
Spain	LOCATION	, are added .

		The book is compact , well written , and acceptably illustrated , and will be found to meet the wants of those in need of accurate general information on the subject .

		The author is an officer in the
Royal Navy	ORGANIZATION	.

		Professor
Smyth	PERSON	's '' Greek Melic Poets '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is marked by the sure and abundant scholarship which we expect from its author .

		The notes are catholic in their range .

		Questions of text criticism , the dialects , metrical theory , and the obscure his - tory of Greek lyric forms , are treated with copious erudition , while literary criticism and illustration are not neglected .

		Professor
Smyth	PERSON	would have made a more useful book for American teachers if he had insisted less rigidly on the scientific distinc - tion between melic poetry and lyric poetry in gen - eral .

		We need for the class-room a convenient annotated edition of the Teubner Anthologla Lyrica including both Iambic and Elegiac poets .

		Pro- fessor
Smyth	PERSON	could easily have found room for this additional text within his 564 pages by referring the student to the histories of Greek literature for much of the historical material given in his intro - ductions .

		The proof-reading and printing have been done with care . ''

		Ruffian Boreas '' is surely
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, not Chaucer .

		And
Rossetti	PERSON	's '' Combi - nation from Sappho '' should read '' Forgot it not , Nay !

		but got it not , for none could get it till now , '' not '' for they could not get it till now . ''

		Twenty vears * n hia `` Twenty Years in
Europe	LOCATION	'' of conLiar -LRB-
Rand	ORGANIZATION	,
McNally & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Mr.
S. H. M.	PERSON	experiences .

		Byers gives us the cream of his recol - lections as a consular officer in
Switzerland	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	from
August , 1869	DATE	, to
September , 1891	DATE	.

		Mr.
Byers	PERSON	's book is lively and entertaining , and contains many anecdotes of and letters from notable people , that are worth preserving .

		Among the letters are fifty from
General Sherman	ORGANIZATION	, whose name crops up frequently in the narrative .

		Mr.
Byers	PERSON	saw something of
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	during the latter 's tour of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Byers	PERSON	made many agreeable and noteworthy acquaintances while abroad , and gratified to the full a keen appetite for sight-seeing .

		His experiences are pleasantly reflected in his book , which is based on a diary kept during the period treated .

		There are a number of illustrations from photographs .

		_ Mr.
J. E. Conner	PERSON	's `` Uncle Sam Abroad ''
/ Rand	ORGANIZATION	,
McNally & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , furnishes in concise form and pop - ular style an elementary yet a fairly critical and comprehensive account of our consular and diplo - matic service .

		The text is cast in the form of five lectures -LRB- supposed to be delivered by '' Professor Loyal of the University of - '' -RRB- on the several topics :
The State Department ; Consular Service Officers ; Consular Service	ORGANIZATION	Duties ; Diplo - matic Service ; Uncle
Sam	PERSON	and Expansion .

		The Appendix contains a tabulated Synopsis of Com - mercial Treaties , and lists of places and their pres - ent incumbents in the two services .

		A slightly humorous flavor pervades the text , which is further popularized by a sprinkling of comic drawings by Mr.
Clyde J. Newman	PERSON	; but serious instruc - tion is the essential purpose of the book .

		Mr.
Conner	PERSON	's views as to the needs and standards of our foreign civil service are sound , and clearly and persuasively put .

		An interesting description of
Nica	ORGANIZATION	- ra S a ' it8 P e P le ' government , pro- ducts , industries , flora and fauna , etc. , together with a brief history of the projected interoceanic waterway which promises in time to turn a main stream of the world 's traffic through this now comparatively virgin country , is to be found in Mr.
W. E. Simmons	PERSON	's '' The
Nicaragua	LOCATION	Canal '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The book is mainly the fruit of personal observation , and is entertainingly written .

		Readers sharing the pretty common , but as we now learn mistaken , belief in the insalubrity of Nica - ragua , will be surprised to find Mr.
Simmons	PERSON	apos - trophizing the country as a '' land of sunny skies and sparkling lakes ; ... of healthful and delight - ful climate . '' ''

		Fevers , '' he adds , '' which in the
United States	LOCATION	are supposed to be the curse of the country , are extremely rare , and it would be hard to find another land in which so little disease of any kind prevails . ''

		BRIEFER MENTION . ''

		A History of Sanskrit Literature '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- , by Dr.
Arthur A. MacDonell	PERSON	, has been added to the series of '' Literatures of the World . ''

		It is the first history of the subject that has been written in English , a fact which gives it a value quite apart from that which re - sults from its great intrinsic merit .

		Heretofore , the English reader has had to remain content with
Weber	PERSON	's volume , nearly half a century old , and with Professor
Max Miiller	PERSON	's history of the Vedic period .

		Since the writer is a competent scholar in his chosen subject , and has made use of the results of the latest scholarship , his volume makes a peculiarly acceptable addition to the useful series for which it has been written .

		English readers have taken much interest in Russian literature of late years , and much has been written upon the subject in a fragmentary way .

		But we have had no good modern manual of the subject and are thus prepared to welcome , in spite of certain shortcomings and defects in perspective , the '' History of Russian Literature '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- , which has recently been pub - lished by Mr.
K. Waliszewski	PERSON	.

		The writer is rather French than Russian in his standpoint , which makes his book lose something in sympathetic insight , although it probably gains in interest of presentation .

		It appears as a volume in the series entitled '' Literatures of the World . ''

		Among the latest issues are lists relating to Trusts and to the Gov - ernment of Dependencies .

		From the -LRB- Copyright Office we have an extremely useful compilation of Copyright Enactments from

1900	DATE	. ''

		Numa Roumestan , '' translated by Mr.
Charles DeKay	PERSON	, and '' The Little Parish Church , '' translated by Mr.
George Burnham Ives	PERSON	, have just been sent us by
Messrs. Little	PERSON	,

		They are uniform with the other volumes of Daudet issued by these publish - ers , and have attractive frontispieces .

		Messrs.
Isaac Pitman	PERSON	& Sons have in press for early publication ''

		A '' Logical Chart for Teaching and Learning the French Conjugation , '' by Mr.

		The Private Memoirs of
Madame Roland	ORGANIZATION	, '' edited by Mr.
Edward Gilpin Johnson	PERSON	, will shortly be issued by
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The work is based upon a translation made from Bosc 's original edition of the memoirs , published at
London	LOCATION	within two years after
Madame Roland	ORGANIZATION	's death .

		It will be the first English translation since the above very scarce English edi - tion .

		The volume will contain a number of full-page illustrations .

		The
University of Illinois	ORGANIZATION	has fallen into line with many of its fellow institutions by inaugurating a series of '' University Studies , '' which will appear at irregular intervals .

		The first number of the series is by Dr.
D. K. Dodge	PERSON	, and has for its subject ''
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	: The Evolution of His Literary Style '' an interesting subject , certainly , and treated with discern - ment .

		The science text-books of the late
Joel Dormau Steele	PERSON	, with their fourteen weeks to each subject , have long been the synonym for everything that is pedagog - ically and scientifically mischievous , and we doubt the desirability of prolonging their life in any shape .

		But it must be admitted that Mrs.
Mabel Loomis Todd	PERSON	, in rewriting the old Steele '' Astronomy , '' has produced a book that is both scientific and interesting .

		This means , of course , that she has produced what is practically a new work ; and we would have been better pleased had she discarded the
Steele	PERSON	idea altogether , for that is more likely to hurt than to help her book .

		The volume is published by the
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		THE DIAL 105 A ROMANCE OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION ROBERT TOURNAY , , w By
WILLIAM SAGE	PERSON	.

		Illustrated , 11.50 .

		If , as we suppose , ''
Robert Tournay	PERSON	'' be Mr.
Sage	PERSON	's first volume , it is certainly a remarkable one .

R. R. BOWKER	PERSON	.

		16mo ,
$ 1.25	MONEY	.

		Among much studying into science we have neglected the science of our own lives ; and with all our learning we have failed to learn the art of living .

		Believing this , and believing also that he who masters life is the happy , the successful man , Mr.
Bowker	PERSON	has set forth in the seven chapters of this book his thoughts of the seriousness , the earnestness , the fidelity with which we should face our opportunities and our responsibilities .

		Through edu - cation , politics , business , and religion he seeks the key of that success which comes from a clear aim , honestly followed , ever emphasizing the truth that the reality is more than the symbol .

		It is a book to be read at leisure and thought about afterward not because it says things new and startling , but because it presses home quietly truths that make for the improvement of man and society .

		134 A QUESTION OF LITERARY CONSCIENCE .

		There are few chapters of literary criticism that surpass , in display of subtle insight and essential justice of conclusion , the well-known essay of
Charles Lamb	PERSON	upon the artificial comedy of the Restoration .

		This essay has always been a stumbling-block to the
Philistine	LOCATION	, and will always appear paradoxical to the reader whose intellectual perceptions do not nicely balance his moral prepossessions .

		Macaulay , as we know , found it both a paradox and a stumbling-block , and assailed it with the weav - er 's beam that he wielded with such redoubtable energy .

		But in spite of the attack of
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	, and of other persons defective in their literary sympathies , the ideas advanced by
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	in this essay have held their own , and criticism has accepted their fundamental validity .

		It will be remembered that
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	's argument runs , in substance , to the effect that the writers whom he defends created a conventional world of their own , in which the rules that ordinarily govern , and properly should govern , human conduct , have no more application than the rules of ordinary probability to the incidents of a Grim Mahrchen or an Arabian tale .

		Lamb declared himself '' glad for a season to take an airing beyond the diocese of the strict con - science , '' and now and then '' for a dream - while or so , to imagine a world with no meddling restrictions . ''

		The world of
Congreve	PERSON	and
Wycherley	PERSON	'' is altogether a speculative scene of things , which has no reference what - ever to the world that is .

		... The whole is a passing pageant , where we should sit as uncon - cerned at the issues , for life or death , as at a battle of the frogs and mice . ''

		His complaint is that people no longer take delight in the pageant , because they have grown too strenuous in their literal-minded interpretation of the show . ''

		Like
Don Quixote	PERSON	, we take part against the puppets , and quite as impertinently . ''

		We are too self-conscious to give ourselves up to mere distraction , and go to the theatre not `` to escape from the pressure of reality so much as to con - firm our experience of it ; to make assurance double , and take a bond of fate . ''

		The fashion of the Restoration comedy is 116 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, one that has now passed away from popular interest , but another fashion has taken its place , concerning which
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	's argument is equally to the point .

		This is the fashion of romantic fiction , toward which our strenuous moralists are apt to assume a deprecatory atti - tude , upon much the same grounds that served as a basis for the condemnation of the earlier fashion .

		Romantic fiction is essentially unreal , we are told ; it does not reflect the conditions of actual life , it encourages us to dream instead of setting us face to face with the problems of human existence , it dissipates our energies in - stead of enlisting them in behalf of worthy social and intellectual causes .

		The charge is doubtless true , but is there no place for dreams in the economy of the spiritual life ?

		Are we to reject the ministry of every form of litera - ture that takes us away from our surroundings , or is not closely related to our immediate pur - suits and interests ?

		Entertainment may not be the highest mission of literature , but it is surely a legitimate object for a writer to set before himself , and those writers who offer entertainment , in whatever fashion the hour may approve , are not undeserving of the public and will not find their efforts unrewarded .

		To say that romantic fiction moves in an unreal world of its own making should not be held a matter for reproach ; it should rather be recog - nized as the necessary condition of this form of art , and should make us grateful for the refuge which it offers to the mind oppressed by the burden , at times so intolerable , of the actual world .

		The art of fiction depends upon conventions quite as fully as does the dramatic art .

		The action must be compressed far beyond the limits of probability , and worked out with small regard for the many disturbing iuflu - ences by which it would certainly be compli - cated in real life .

		The villain must be foiled , the hero must triumph , and the lovers must be united , even if there are only a score of pages in which to accomplish all these things .

		Whatever the length of the story , these are its fundamental requirements ; and to such ends all the means employed by the writer must be bent .

		Each separate scene , moreover , must be heightened in effect far beyond anything that is likely to occur in everyday life ; two people seated side by side at a dinner - table must make their con - versation more brilliant than any that was ever actually heard upon such an occasion ; the members of every group of persons brought into contact for the purposes of the narrative must say and do just the right things at the right moments , instead of floundering about in act and speech as they doubtless would in the haphazard actual world .

		In that world , as the poet reminds us , we get `` never the time and the place and the loved one all together '' ; but in the world which the romantic imagination creates we have a right to expect this conjunc - tion , and a reason for justifiable disappointment if it is missed .

		The romance of pure adventure appeals to some of our healthiest instincts .

		Both as boys and as men , we like to follow the fortunes of pirates , to read about shipwrecks and all other sorts of forlorn hopes , and to applaud the deeds of heroes who slay their enemies right and left , and escape from the most desperate dangers by feats of improbable prowess and display of indomitable if not superhuman valor .

		The gentlest spirits as well as the most fiery delight in these things , and delight in them precisely because they are so far removed from ordinary human experience .

		They are the happenings of a world which , at least when we have out - grown boyhood , we have no desire to make our own , a world which could not be our own if we wished it , a world which we frankly recognize as imagined for our diversion .

		We should ill requite those who purvey for us all this inno - cent entertainment were we to arraign them before the bar of science , to make stern inquiry into the probability of their imaginings , and to pronounce upon the conduct of their characters such severe judgments as would doubtless await such conduct in the courts of justice of our prosaic world .

		Nevertheless , although we are fully per - suaded of the right of romantic fiction to exist and of its heroes to perform acts which would not bear the test of a prosaic and conventional morality , we are not without certain searchings of soul when we contemplate the enormous vogue enjoyed by this species of literature at the present day .

		Of that vogue there can be no question .

		It would be difficult to point to any earlier period in which popular fiction was so largely made up of tales of adventure , tales whose interest centres upon exploits rather than principles , upon the triumph of the individual will rather than of the abstract ideal .

		There is an appalling amount of bloodshed in our popular romance , and an almost unexampled degree of recklessness in the choice of means for the desired end .

		One need not be a pro- fessional moralist to correlate this illustration of popular taste with the wave of brutality which seems to be sweeping over our civiliza -
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 117 tion , and which threatens to submerge the moral territory that has been reclaimed at so great a cost of individual and collective effort .

		For some reason or other , the finer instincts of civilization seem of late years to have become dulled , and both individuals and nations are suffered without effective protest to commit acts which should arouse the fiercest indignation for their contravention of all the principles by which nations achieve true greatness and indi - viduals bequeath to their descendants a heri - tage of honorable fame .

		We should hardly include our popular literature among the active causes of this degenerative process , but it may not be unfair to regard it as symptomatic .

		We may read with zest the popular literature which glories in brute force , and we may get no harm from it as individuals ; but we must '' view with alarm , '' as the political platforms say , the ever-increasing hold which this species of lit - erature is gaining upon the popular mind .

		If such literature does not directly shape the ac - tions of men , it certainly does to some extent reflect their ideals , and its present prominence is such as to confront the literary conscience with a serious question .

		Should we , because they afford us such admirable entertainment , give our unqualified approval to these writings that glorify all the brutal passions , that move in a world unswayed by the moral law , and that substitute for the Christian precepts a gospel whereof
Carlyle	PERSON	and
Nietzsche	PERSON	are the evangelists ?

		It is a serious question , whether the ideals of public and private morality , as reflected in the popular literature of the day , which this century is about to pass on to the next , will bear a favorable comparison with those which the last century bequeathed to our own .

		A GREAT AMERICAN POLITICIAN .

		* Few Americans better deserve the appella - tion of '' great politician '' than
William H. Seward	PERSON	.

		Born in
1801	DATE	, he was already a party leader in his county at the early age of 23 , and he continued active or interested in politics until his final retirement forty - five years after - wards at the age of 69 .

		For much more than half of this period he was in public office .

		He was State Senator , 1829-1833 ; Governor of his
State	ORGANIZATION	, 1839-1843 ; United States Senator , 1849-1861 ; and
Secretary of State	ORGANIZATION	, 186 -RCB- -
1869	DATE	, making in all twenty-eight years of official life .

		Moreover , during seventeen years of the forty-five years that he was out of office he was not out of politics , for , as his present biographer remarks , speaking of the period following his retirement from the
State Senate	ORGANIZATION	, '' he always had time for profitable politics , and he knew how to plan . ''

		He some - times wearied of political conflicts and party strife ; he sometimes spoke of his principal employment for so many years in the tone of disgust , painting at the same time '' a fond picture of retirement his otium cum digni - tate oceans of leisure in midst of shrubs and flowers , as he jocosely translated it '' ; but there is less of this self-deluding sentiment in his biography than is to be found in the biographies of most public men of equal eminence .

		When he retired from
the State Senate	ORGANIZATION	in
1833	DATE	and returned to the '' much-coveted quiet of his study and profession , '' he wrote to his friend Weed rejoicing that he was '' free from the wearying and * unprofitable life ' that he had been living at
Albany	LOCATION	, and hoped that he was at home to remain for a long time '' ; but he significantly added : '' Keep me informed upon political matters , and take care that you do not so far get absorbed in professional occupations that you will cease to care for me as a politician . ''

		When a politician calls in his next friend in such fashion as this , he is not very likely to need his assistance . ''

		The world knows , '' says our author , in relating this incident , '' what the politician means when he says farewell . ''

		Seward spoke his true nature when , at the same perfod of his life , he wrote : '' I shall , from the force of constitutional bias , be found always mingling in the controversies which agi - tate the country .

''

		The following addendum reveals that even then he was an adept in the genial optimistic philosophy which he so freely dispensed to others and employed so soothingly in his own case in after life .

		`` I shall go on as always , adopting what my judg - ment and my conscience approve .

		If my career ends where it now is , I shall have enjoyed , if not all I de - served , as much of success as is my reasonable share .

		If success comes as it hitherto has done , when I am laboring in what seems to me the right cause , it will be doubly gratifying , because it will bring no remorse . ''

		The fact is ,
William H. Seward	PERSON	's mind and temper were thoroughly political , and he could no more keep out of politics than a fish can keep out of water .

		The character of Mr.
Seward	PERSON	's life naturally determines the character of Mr.
Bancroft	PERSON	's book .

		Seward was , indeed , much more than a politician .

		Ho was a man of large mental and social cultivation ; he delighted in nature and travel , and actually travelled far more than most of his compeers in public life ; he was a lawyer , and rose to a high place , although not to the highest place , in his profession .

		More - over , some of the author 's most pleasing chap - ters deal with these interesting topics , such as '' Travels , '' ''
Seward	PERSON	as a Lawyer , '' '' Some Personal Traits and Characteristics , '' the '' Man and Senator '' ; but such themes altogether , including the first years and last years of life , fill fewer than 100 of the
1225	DATE	pages that make up the two volumes .

		The work is em - phatically a political biography .

		Still , we do not wish to imply that
Seward	PERSON	was not states - man as well as politician .

		With all his tact and arts of conciliation , traits in which he greatly excelled , Mr.
Seward	PERSON	sharply divided men in opinion while he was living ; and it is inevitable that any writer who deals with his history , if he attempts more than a bald sketch , will divide his readers now that
Seward	ORGANIZATION	has long been dead .

		First , there is the selection from the mass of material of such matter as will , when properly presented , give a full and fair view of
Seward	ORGANIZATION	's life and character .

		Here we think Mr.
Ban	PERSON	- croft is deserving of commendation .

		He has studied his subject with evident thoroughness , and has shown good judgment in the selection of his matter .

		Mr.
Seward	PERSON	's entry into public life was coincident with the sound and fury that made up political anti-masonry ; he iden - tified himself with the Whig party at its form - ation , and continued , not merely a Whig , but a prominent Whig leader , until the dissolution of the party ; he cast in his lot with the Re - publicans soon after the organization of that party , rose to the highest place in its councils but one , and , although he became widely sepa - rated from many of his old colleagues after the Civil War , he still favored the Republican Presidential candidates in
1868	DATE	and
1872	DATE	.

		Here is a great variety of topics of the highest interest , and Mr.
Bancroft	PERSON	has so handled them as to make perfectly clear what they are in themselves and what were Mr.
Seward	PERSON	's rela - tions to them .

		While we should have been pleased to see a little better sense of proportion in some parts of the work , we do not feel that we have serious cause for complaint .

		Our severest criticism would be that the last years of
Seward	ORGANIZATION	's official life have been passed over too hurriedly .

		Some events of
Johnson	ORGANIZATION	's adminis - tration , as his quarrel with
Grant	PERSON	, may be re - ferred to .

		It will be remembered that in the celebrated issue of '' veracity '' between the President and the
General	ORGANIZATION	,
Seward	ORGANIZATION	, in a way , endorsed his chief ; but the incident is not mentioned in these pages .

		But , secondly , the crucial test comes on the question of interpretation : what do the facts mean ?

		Mr.
Bancroft	PERSON	has been severely criti - cised for both the amount and the character of the commentary that he has incorporated in his history .

		He is continually interpolating , it is charged , unnecessary and unjust explanations of
Seward	ORGANIZATION	's utterances and acts , particularly in the first volume , which closed with the Presi - dential election of
1860	DATE	.

		We have not space to deal with this subject directly , farther than to observe that this volume does not , on the whole , leave on the mind a favorable impres - sion of Mr.
Seward	PERSON	as a politician , but rather distinctly the contrary .

		Indirectly , however , we wish to say that Mr.
Seward	PERSON	constantly challenges discussion and provokes commentary .

		He was not a man of simple but rather of complex mental character ; few of our eminent statesmen have been more so ; he is constantly arousing the activity of the harmonist or of the critic ; and the biographer who should confine himself to the plain story , abjuring all attempts at inter - pretation , would show a rare power of self - abnegation .

		The principal questions are not only historically interesting but they are deeply rooted in the character of the man .

		What did
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 119 Seward really mean by the '' higher law , '' the '' irrepressible conflict , '' the peace-in-sixty-days prophecies , and by his proposal to Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	in the month of
April , 1861	DATE	, that war at home should be averted , or an attempt be made to avert it , by wantonly getting up war abroad ?

		The biographer , especially if psychologically inclined , feels bound to make answer to these questions ; but to make answer is to provoke disagreement .

		In complexity of character , Mr.
Seward	PERSON	reminds us of
Jefferson	LOCATION	, of whom one of the best known of American historians says that he can not be sketched in outline , but must be painted '' stroke by stroke . ''

		We do not undertake to propound theories relative to these interesting questions ; but for us , how - ever it may be with others , Mr.
Bancroft	PERSON	states the substance of truth when he says that
William H. Seward	PERSON	was two men in one ,
John Quincy Adams	PERSON	and
Thurlow	PERSON	Weed '' not less eager to inherit the mantle of the one than to be the beneficiary of the schemes and power of the other , '' but equally sincere in both cases .

		Our author says , dealing with the Senatorial period : ''
Seward	PERSON	continued to hear the two voices in fact , he continued to act two distinct roles .

		It was
John Quincy Adams Seward	PERSON	that uttered the telling phrases and made the severe arraignments and was the hope of the radicals like
Gerrit Smith	PERSON	,
Theodore Parker	PERSON	, and , at times , of the Garrisonians .

		He usually favored what was boldest and most extreme if it stopped short of violence .

		On the other hand ,
Thurlow Weed Seward	ORGANIZATION	kept in close relations with the party organization ; he watched the plans of the politicians , changed the pro- gramme to suit conditions , and tried to win all classes of men .


Adams Seward	PERSON	was ardently anti-slavery and expected to live in history as a great philanthropist .

		Weed
Seward	PERSON	was determined to control the patronage and to live in the
White House	ORGANIZATION	.

		The one regarded himself as a martyr to a sacred cause , and wrote : ' I am alone , in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	and in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and about in the
United States	LOCATION	, alone .

		While adhering faithfully to the Whigs , I dare to hold on the disallowed right of disenfranchised men and classes .

		I must stand in that solitude and maintain it , or fall altogether . '

		The other was alone in deciding which principles and theories should be given prominence and which should be ig - nored or explained away .

		The result was that
Seward	ORGANIZATION	continued to be the political favorite of a large propor - tion of the champions of freedom and of ardent youth - ful voters of the best impulses , as well as of the prac - tical men and hard-headed politicians , calculating on tendencies and eager for office . ''

		The meaning of all this is that Mr.
Seward	PERSON	was a thorough-going opportunist , but certainly not an opportunist of the baser sort .

		That he often saw far into the future , and with perfect clearness , is true beyond question ; but then again , politician that he was , he sometimes showed himself wholly blind to impending po - litical changes of the most important character .

		For one thing , he was slow to believe in the disruption of existing parties and the formation of new ones .

		At first he inclined to the Demo - cratic-Republican party that
Jefferson	PERSON	had founded , to which his father was firmly at - tached ; but it was as impossible for him to act with that party , in the long run , as it was for him not to be a politician at all .

		He was impelled toward the other school of political thought by his mental character , as well as by his dislike of the
Albany Regency	LOCATION	; so that it was predetermined , as far as such things are predetermined , that he should be first a Whig and then a Republican .

		But first he toyed with the Anti-Masonic party .

		Young as he was in those days , Seward could hardly have had any faith in this movement as Anti-Ma - sonry , and must have been drawn to it , or driven to it , as the only effectual or practical way of opposing the party then in power , and of promoting certain objects in which he was interested that had become associated with the Anti-Masonic movement .

		But with the Whigs , and later the Republicans , with their large national views , he was in his element .

		Reverting to
Seward	ORGANIZATION	's partial defect in po - litical prevision , one is surprised to find him writing to
Charles Sumner	PERSON	after the crushing defeat of the Whigs in
1852	DATE	, when many lead - ing men considered the defeat annihilation : '' I answer that just now there is nothing to say , only that recent events are what they were or might have been foreseen , and that they do not disturb me in the least .

		No new party will arise , nor will any old one
fall	DATE	.

		The issue will not change .

		We shall go on much as heretofore , I think , only that the last effort to convert the Whig party to slavery has failed . ''

		Two years after this , the
New York	LOCATION	'' Times , '' which reflected the sentiments of
Seward	ORGANIZATION	and Weed , repeatedly predicted both
Seward	ORGANIZATION	's nomination as a Whig candidate for the Presi - dency , and his election , in
1856	DATE	.

		Seward did not look for the dissolution of the Whig party .

		Naturally , therefore , he took no part in the efforts made in
1854	DATE	to organize the Anti- Slavery forces of the country efforts that led to the formation of the Republican party , of which he was proud a little later to be the great leader but rather discouraged them .

		Naturally , too ,
Greeley	PERSON	wrote in `` The Trib - une , '' when the
New York	LOCATION	election was over : '' Instead , however , of taking the position which cir - cumstances and his own antecedents seemed to require , Mr.
Seward	PERSON	, adhering to the vacated shell of
Whiggery	LOCATION	, has stood aside and allowed the great movement of the Free States to go forward without a word of bold and hearty encouragement from its natural leader .

		The result is recorded in the returns of this election . ''

		120 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, But Mr.
Seward	PERSON	had a personal reason for going slowly at this time .

		His senatorial term would expire in
1855	DATE	, and he did not wish to fall between stools .

		Here was more oppor - tunism .

		What is more , the hesitancy and in - decision which marks men of speculative mind , when the time comes for action , was no doubt a factor in the problem , as it was in many other problems in Mr.
Seward	PERSON	's life .

		No doubt , too , such hesitancy or indecision is a part of opportunism .

		It is natural that a poli - tician should be slow to believe that a great party that he has served and loved , and to which he is looking for favors , should be mori - bund ; but
Seward	PERSON	should have seen , at least after
1852	DATE	, that such was the state of the Whigs .

		Still , it was in those very days , perhaps , that
Seward	PERSON	rendered his country the greatest ser - vice .

		This he did in the early , powerful , and constant testimony that he bore against Slavery .

		Of politicians of high rank , he was the first to discern the true nature of the peculiar institu - tion , to see where it was bearing the country , to oppose it stoutly on high moral and political grounds , and to foretell what the end would be freedom victorious over slavery .

		Witness his speech to the Whigs of the Western Re - serve , made at
Cleveland	LOCATION	in
1848	DATE	.

		To be sure , there was much in his life that was inconsistent with his lofty avowal of principle ; but , poli - tician as he was , he did not believe that the ends which he sought could be gained without the aid of a powerful political party , and so he clung to the Whigs even when it is hard to see how any man of his clearness of vision could discover any real soundness in the party .

		With his defeat at
Chicago	LOCATION	in I860 , Mr.
Seward	PERSON	seems definitively to have abandoned his presidential ambition ; and with such aban - donment , his political life , Mr.
Bancroft	PERSON	holds , ascended to a higher level .

		He accounts him the greatest of
American Secretaries of State	ORGANIZATION	, and believes that the estimation in which his great services in that office are held by the American people will increase rather than diminish as the years go by .

		A man of generous feeling , who agrees in the main with
Seward	ORGANIZATION	's political ideas , can hardly fail to sympathize with him in the great disappointment of his life ; but when we recall
Seward	PERSON	's opportunism , and especially the manifestations of his opportun - ism in the period between the election of Mr.
Xiincoln	PERSON	and the conclusive joining of the issue in the succeeding year reflecting upon the uncertainty of the result , if it had been left in
Seward	LOCATION	's hands one can hardly fail to see that the country had a fortunate escape from probable if not certain peril when the nomina - tion went to the comparatively unknown can - didate from
Illinois	LOCATION	.

		It remains only to add that Mr.
Bancroft	PERSON	has made a valuable contribution to a very im - portant part of our political history .

		NATURE BY Dowx AND PAVE .

		* In Mr.
W. H. Hudson	PERSON	's large and handsome volume entitled '' Nature in Downland , '' the term '' Downland '' is applied to the range of low treeless hills popularly known as the
South Downs	LOCATION	, which run parallel with the line of the sea-coast in the county of
Sussex	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	.

		The hills are of chalk formation , with soft rounded outlines and fluted sides , and are cov - ered with a thick fine turf which affords the best of pasturage for the famous breed of sheep bearing the name of the hills on which they feed .

		To the average mind , these bare and monoto - nous elevations , as they are delineated by the author , and by the artist who assists him , are not particularly prepossessing ; yet upon Mr.
Hudson	PERSON	they exercised a fascination so absorb - ing and persistent that for weeks and months of the
year 1899	DATE	he was rambling over them , a solitary but diligent student of their varying aspects and productions .

		Neither the heats of midsummer nor the storm and gloom of winter had force to lessen his enthusiasm .

		In storm or shine , in
August	DATE	or
December	DATE	, he was pleased to be out in the open alone , quietly noting the changes in earth and sky and in the wild life that came under his observation .

		It was a singular choice of pastime or indus - try , judged by ordinary standards , but to him the returns were ample in satisfaction .

		Clad in a suit of grayish-brown tweeds , of the tint and texture best adapted to the purpose of the field naturalist that of approaching unnoticed the bird or beast his eye was fixed on , he prolonged his daily tramp for ten or twelve hours together .

		For food when hungry and for shelter at nightfall , he depended upon the hos - pitality of the cottagers whose humble habita - * NATURE IN DOWNLAND .

		THE DIAL 121 tions are found at long intervals in the desert - like region .

		He carried no weapon of offense or defense , his intent being kindly toward every living creature , but he was never without one invari - able companion , a powerful binocular , of all man 's inventions that which to him '' was the most like a divine gift . ''

		Nothing was too small or too mean to engage his attention with the help of this valuable aid to the vision .

		For hours he could gaze on the thistle-down filling the air , and he made it the subject of pages of reminiscent and original comment .

		The plants underfoot , the insects in the air , '' the little winged men and women called birds , '' the ani - mals clothed in scales or in fur , the clouds in the sky , all that is included in Nature , was the subject of his careful and minute consideration .

		He had the fine instinct which enables one to discern the beauty inherent in everything , '' the beauty and grace and sweetness and melody '' that exist everywhere .

		It was this that made '' every hour of the day and every step of the way , '' during his months of solitary sauntering on the
South Downs	LOCATION	, a keen and pure delight such as the world dreams not of .

		Mr.
Hudson	PERSON	has heretofore made valuable contributions to the facts of natural history .

		His youth was spent on the plains of the Argen - tine Republic , and at this early period of life he developed a talent for searching and accu - rate inquiry into the secrets of the wild life about him , and an equal ability for reporting the discoveries that resulted .

		During his later sojourn in
England	LOCATION	he has continued in the same line of study , and his work has a value justly esteemed by the fellows of his craft .

		The present volume is a comprehensive survey of the structure , the surface , the specialties of the pastoral region of
Sussex	LOCATION	, not excluding its human characteristics .

		The narrative is in harmony with the subject , serene and unevent - ful .

		A series of expressive illustrations accom - pany the letter-press .

		Mr.
Charles M. Skinner	PERSON	has made his mark as a clever writer , always spirited and amusing , and at times brilliant .

		His name attached to a volume is therefore a definite recommenda - tion .

		In the one now before us , `` Flowers in the Pave , '' he has brought together eleven short sketches , most of which relate to his experi - ences in contact with
Nature	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is from the point of view of a nature-lover that he chiefly discourses , and many a bright , poetical , tender , and pathetic thing does he say to us in this amiable character .

		It is a happy temperament which Mr.
Skinner	PERSON	possesses , the aesthetic temperament with its gift for seeing the pictures and hearing the music of the universe .

		He is aware of these moving sights and sounds in the city streets , the back yards , the alleys even , and they appeal to him with persuasive joy by night as by day .

		Such spirits among us have a mission to fulfil .

		It is to awaken others to a sense of the delights which are common to all , which are as cheap as the daylight , and as much at our command as the air we breathe .

		Mr.
Skinner	PERSON	appreciates the obligation which his gift Jays upon him , and faithfully endeavors to communicate his pleasure in the beauty with which Nature sur - rounds us even in the densest cities ' confines .

		In a characteristic passage , he says : '' There is always the sky ; the stars are lighted after dark ; some yards boast a spear or two of grass ; dis - tance will not be cheated of its magic , nor wholly shut off by buildings ; there is even a tree uow and again ; and birds , dogs , cats , and children bring a touch of free life to the scene ... Some of the best hours in a man 's life are those when he is beholden to nothing and nobody , when he simply looks at the sky or the woods or the hills , or from his window gazes into tree-tops , clean and rare delight . ''

		The foregoing passage is taken from the first and longest piece in the book .

		Next to this in our favor is the final essay , which is a grateful exposition of '' The Kindness of Na - ture . ''

		We hear so much uow-a-days of the cruelty of our earth-mother that a testimony to her loving intent toward her children comes with peculiar graciousness .

		We make room for a bit of this to show the force of the au - thor 's argument : '' For one who is crushed beneath a falling tree are there not a hundred thousand who eat its fruit , who re - joice in its shade , who breathe a purified air about it , who bask in its heat when it gives back its store of sunshine in our fireplace on a
winter	DATE
night	TIME	?

		For one who succeeds in filling himself with malaria , through careless living , think how many find only health and beauty and food and business in the fields .

		... In the - perfect order of Nature we read a kindness that is - deeper than our ability to adjust ourselves to it .

		Man .

		is more abusive than the earth .

		He slays for gain , he slays for sport , he fells the woods , he blasts the hills , he dries the streams , he mars loveliness , he lives un - beautifully , until he gets intelligence and sees that the rest of creation thrives by opposite conduct , when he begins to act with modesty and to harmonize his actions , to those of the rest of the world . ''

		Mr.
Skinner	PERSON	is an optimist as well as a na - ture-lover , and preaches his glad gospel at every proper opening .

		It is enlivening to hear him say : '' I believe that the human type is bettering all the time , in spite of the people one meets in city slums and 122 THE DIAL -LSB- Sept 1 , other unexcellent places , where they seem to be sinking back from the standard . ''

		And again : '' Do away with occasion for gloom .

		It is well with the rest of the world , so , why not with us ?

		Let 's be glad we were born , instead of sorry that other folks were .

		The hospitable state of mind is best , because it is most like nature . ''

		We will make one more extract , because of its pungent suggestion ; '' In my days of solitude in the fields the city weight falls off and I
spring	DATE	erect like a pine released after long bending .

		I live .

		I find myself .

		God forgive me for selling so much of my life for wages . ''

		It is a sane and wholesome soul that can speak like this .

		Mr.
Skinner	PERSON	reveres his in - stincts , and cherishes them ; therefore it is that amidst the cark and care that business in a city inevitably imposes , there is still much saving '' music and song '' in his daily life .

		After the examples we have given of the dash and humor and charm in Mr.
Skinner	PERSON	's essays , we are forced to express the conviction that he could do much better if he desired , and that we ought really to demand a higher order of writing from a man with his pronounced and versatile talents .

		It is easy to imagine the finished work he might produce with delibera - tion and care and with the righteous ambition which should be a part of the equipment of every writer who asks the ear of the public .

		THE ROMANTIC HISTORY OP
TEXAS	LOCATION	.

		* There is , perhaps , no State in the
Union	LOCATION	which possesses so individual , so striking , so picturesque a past as
Texas	LOCATION	.

		Six different sovereignties have in turn claimed her alle - giance .

		Discovered and traversed by the ad - venturous Spaniards in the sixteenth century , no contestant appeared until La Salle , the ex - plorer of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	, landed by mischance on the shores of the
Espiritu Santo	LOCATION	, in
1685	DATE	, where he planted his short-lived colony .

		Then began the dispute over the possession of the territory , which ended only with the Mexican War .

		The coming of the French caused the Spaniards to occupy the country , their first establishment dating from
1690	DATE	, many years before the hardy pioneers of the
Atlantic States	LOCATION	had crept past the barrier of the Alleghanies .

		More than a hundred years elapsed ere the * A COMPREHENSIVE HISTORY OF

		In two volumes .


Dallas	LOCATION	,
Texas	LOCATION	: Pub - lished by
William G. Scarff	PERSON	.

		Anglo-Americans , owning the sovereignty of
Mexico	LOCATION	, entered that region as colonists .

		The time was short , however , after their coming until the province was in a state of insurrec - tion ; an insurrection which led to war and independence .

		The republic which was set up , after a decade , became a member of the
Union	LOCATION	; but when the great rupture of the States came ,
Texas	LOCATION	cast her lot with the South .

		Since that time she has made wonderful progress both in material development and in the wider influ - ence exerted on national affairs .

		From this bare outline it must be perceived that the field of
Texas	LOCATION	history is broad and inviting .

		It is therefore with pleasure that we note the recent issue of what the publisher well pronounces an
Encyclopedia of Texas History	ORGANIZATION	.

		The text is made up in the first part of Yoa - kuni 's '' History of
Texas	LOCATION	'' with some '' sup - plemental '' chapters ; in the second , of '' a complete history of the
State of Texas	ORGANIZATION	from
1845	DATE	to 1897 '' ; and in the third , of a series of articles covering such topics as the '' Indian Tribes of
Texas	LOCATION	, '' etc. .

		The republication of
Yoakum 's History	ORGANIZATION	, of which only a limited edi - tion ever appeared -LRB- 1855 -RRB- , is an important feature of the work .

		So far as the student of history is concerned , however , much of the value of this republication is lost in the failure to reprint the notes and citations of the orig - inal author .

		To aggravate this , new notes are occasionally added by
F. W. Johnson	PERSON	, from his MS. History of
Texas	LOCATION	, which frequently take
Yoakum	PERSON	to task without indicating any other authority than Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	.

		This is always unfortunate , for the student has no clue whereby he may continue the search in the endeavor to arrive at the truth .

		The sixteenth century , during which time
Grijalva	PERSON	,
Pineda	PERSON	,
Cabeza de Vaca	ORGANIZATION	,
Guzman	PERSON	,
Coronado	ORGANIZATION	, and others , explored parts of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, receives only passing notice in this work .

		The history proper begins with the landing of La Salle on the coast of the
Espiritu Santo	ORGANIZATION	in
February , 1685	DATE	.

		Sieur de La Salle sailed to plant a colony on the
Mississippi	LOCATION	, then known as
Rio del Espiritu Santo	ORGANIZATION	; but failing in his calculations , he entered a bay on the coast of
Texas	LOCATION	, since known as
Matagorda	LOCATION	.

		La Salle was slain , and the colony came to an end a few months after through Indian attacks and inter - nal dissensions .

		But the Spaniards in
Mexico	LOCATION	had heard of the expedition , and soon a small army was on the soil of
Texas	LOCATION	.

		Precarious settlements were made as the Spaniards became alarmed for the safety of their sovereign 's do -
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 123 minions .

		The
State and Church	ORGANIZATION	marched hand in hand in forming missions : the territory would be preserved and the Indians converted .

		The mission-founding began in
1690	DATE	, and con - tinued irregularly for almost a century .

		Nine - teen distinct establishments were made in the territory known as
Texas	LOCATION	.

		This most unique and interesting epoch the Mission period has received too little attention .

		When we consider that this regime lasted until the com - ing of the American colonists , and that it affected in no small measure the social , political , and economic development of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, it must become apparent that the subject is worthy of more extended treatment than that which Yoa - kum gave it fifty years ago .

		The period of American colonization began with
Moses Austin	PERSON	, who went to
Mexico	LOCATION	in
1820	DATE	, during the troublous times of the revo - lution , and secured a grant of land lying in the rich valley of the
Colorado	LOCATION	river .

		This colony became the nucleus of the present
State	ORGANIZATION	, which now ranks seventh in population in the
Union	LOCATION	.

		The
Austin MSS.	LOCATION	, printed in articles contrib - uted by
Guy M. Bryan	PERSON	, throw much light on the development of the colonies which were rapidly filled with emigrants from the '' over - crowded '' States .

		The result of the occupation of
Texas	LOCATION	might have been forecast .

		Two peoples , with such distinct customs and ideas as the Americans and their Mexican rulers , could not hope to dwell in peace .

		By the year
1835	DATE	contentions and usurpations led to insurrection and war ;
1836	DATE	found
Santa Anna	LOCATION	, the despot of
Mexico	LOCATION	, in the hands of the Texans as a result of the great victory of
San Jacinto	LOCATION	.

		In
March of that year	DATE	independence was declared .

		Such a state of affairs had been brought about , not by the slavery party of the South , as many anti- slavery writers have indicated , but chiefly by the original colonists , who fought for their rights in the first place with no idea of imme - diate freedom .

		This is clearly established by documentary evidence which must be consid - ered by future students of the question of slavery .

		However , there remains much to be done in the way of writing the complete history of the sharp and bloody revolution which gave
Texas	LOCATION	her independence .

		The Mexican version of the matter , with the political history of the colonies during the conflict and through the period of independent existence , offer tempting inducements to the investigator .

		At the time of the revolution ,
Texas	LOCATION	was inhabited by about 30,000 Anglo-Americans , 5,000 slaves , 3,000 Mexicans , and 14,000 In - dians .

		During the period of
the Republic	ORGANIZATION	, which lasted from
1836	DATE	to
1845	DATE	, the popula - tion grew at a tremendous rate .

		The story of the annexation is well told in these volumes , in an essay by General
Sam Bell Maxey	PERSON	.

		The struggle in the
State	ORGANIZATION	itself is contrasted with the larger controversy which was precipitated in the
Union	ORGANIZATION	over the question of the annexa - tion .

		The full import of the accession of
Texas	LOCATION	on the politics of the time , on the slavery agitation , on the aggressive spirit of the nation , is not brought out satisfactorily .

		Indeed , thus far the subject of the Mexican War has received no adequate or competent treatment .

		The causes which gave rise to it were not all of recent growth ; some of them dated from the
Louisiana Purchase	LOCATION	, some earlier , some later .

		The immediate cause of the Mexican War the annexation of
Texas	LOCATION	has been allowed to obscure all others .

		The Mexican govern - ment , at that time rent by faction and revo - lution , inherited the odium which had been originally
Spain	LOCATION	's and suffered in conse - quence .

		In another sense , the Mexican War was a manifestation of the predatory tendencies of the Anglo-Saxon race .

		From the Mexican War to
1895	DATE	the history is narrated by ex-Governor
Oran M. Roberts	PERSON	, recently deceased .

		It is a concise , praiseworthy discussion , which , however , deals primarily with political aspects .

		The history of the growth of parties in the
State	ORGANIZATION	is not so well told elsewhere .

		Naturally , having played a part in the proceedings himself , some allow - ance must occasionally be made for the per - sonal element .

		The exciting years which pre - ceded the Civil War are well presented .

		The division of the people over the question of secession is notable ; the contest was bitterly waged , but , once committed to a policy ,
the State	ORGANIZATION	stood manfully by its position .

		The more recent events , as well as many of the essays , have interest only for those vitally concerned with the history of
the State	ORGANIZATION	.

		How - ever , some of the special articles are noteworthy contributions to the history of the
Southwest	ORGANIZATION	.

		Examples are '' The Fredonian War , '' `` Official Documents , Laws ,
Decrees	LOCATION	, and Regulations Pertaining to
Austin	LOCATION	's Colonies , '' '' The Indian Tribes of
Texas	LOCATION	, '' '' Spanish and Mexican Titles to Land in
Texas	LOCATION	, their Origin and History , 1691-1835 . ''

		The last contribution , `` The Results of Fifty Years of Progress in
Texas	LOCATION	, '' is a fitting close to the history .

		The arrangement of the materials might 124 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, have been varied a little with profit ; but lack of unity , from the nature of the case , could not have been avoided .

		The failure to cite , from page to page , the authorities and sources drawn upon , detracts much from the worth of the History .

		It must be said , too , that a few of the contributions are hardly more than memoirs but memoirs of much import .

		An ample index adds much to the convenience of the reader .

		The two thousand pages of the two volumes , with their three hundred and sixty-four illustrations , exhibit a neatness and finish which would do credit to any publishing house .

		In fine , the work as a whole marks an epoch in the making of
Texas	LOCATION	history .

		RECENT FICTION .

		* When Mr.
Robert Herrick	PERSON	published '' The Gos - pel of Freedom , '' a year or two ago , he gave evidence of a degree of constructive skill and artistic sincerity that augured well for whatever future work he might produce .

		Up to that time his work had been tentative and confined within narrow limits ; he had undertaken nothing of really ambitious design .

		But `` The Gospel of Freedom '' at once gave him an assured place among our serious novelists , and sug - gested even finer powers than it exhibited .

		Of his new novel , '' The Web of Life , '' we are not justified in faying that it exhibits an advance upon the earlier work , but it is safe to say that there has been no retrogression .

		It is a strongly conceived domestic story , filled with earnestness and fine idealism .

		Possibly the idealism is somewhat too impatient , and the earnestness too unrelieved by those lighter touches that writers of more experience , however serious their ultimate purpose , usually contrive to add ; but these defects if such they be do not * THE WEB OF LIFE .

		weigh very much against the admirable accomplish - ment of the book .

		The hero is a young man of fine impulses set in the midst of a sordid society , and revolting with his whole soul against the gross and selfish ideals that surround him on every hand .

		His revolt is so extreme that he casts aside what are commonly considered '' opportunities '' for advance - ment , and goes so far as to defy all the conventions by living without the customary legal sanctions in company with the woman whom he loves .

		The story of his struggle for a living under these condi - tions , and of the heroic act by which the woman , at last grown conscious that she is ruining his career , sacrifices her own life to set him free , is told with directness and simple pathos .

		He has learned at last how hard it is to kick against the pricks , and is ready to take up the life of external conformity without any abandonment of internal principle .

		The scene is laid in
Chicago	LOCATION	, concerning which com - munity the writer finds occasion to utter many truths unpalatable to its inhabitants .

		That they are truths is undeniable to any disinterested ob - server ; perhaps it is fair to say that they are not sufliciently relieved by other truths of the more agreeable sort .

		Somehow the book leaves the impres - sion of a society in which there is no such thing as purity of motive or elevation of soul ; it is , as we said before , the book of an impatient idealist , of a writer whose indignation has got the better of his sympathies .

		We expect that Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	will fall into a mellower vein after a time , and thereby gain a wider influence than he can expect to exert through a book like '' The Web of Life , '' with all its serious sincerity of purpose .

		`` The Prelude and the Play , '' by Mr.
Rufus Mann	PERSON	, is a novel that may be coupled with the one just now under discussion , although it is far inferior in execution .

		The style is pretentious and affected ; the elaboration of motive and analysis is greatly overdone .

		This novel also has its scene in
Chicago	LOCATION	at least in large part and it also presents the contrast although not so sharply between the THE PRINCESS SOPHIA .

		THE DIAL 125 ideal plane of life and the lower material plane . ''

		These men here would n't be half bad if they could only forget their principles , '' is a remark made by one of the characters , and we feel like applying it to the author himself .

		He is so intent upon prin - ciples that he altogether fails to give us character - ization , and there is not a figure in his book that seems really alive .

		A pretty enough sentiment takes the place of passion , and the characters are moved about like pawns on a chessboard ; we never feel that they are moving themselves .

		We should add that it is dangerous to use French and Italian words without knowing the languages .

		An Italian who said '' non , signora '' would be a curiosity , a woman can not be epris , and there is no such mon - ster as a bete noir known to syntax .

		It is a far cry from '' The Confessions of a Frivo - lous Girl , '' a youthful indiscretion which Mr.
Robert Grant	PERSON	now doubtless wishes were forgotten , to '' Unleavened Bread , '' his latest work of fiction .

		It is not so far a cry from hia more recent chapters on '' The Art of Living , '' but even in this latter com - parison the distance is considerable , being the dis - tance between a light and superficial social philoso - phy and a dissection of society that probes far beneath the surface and lays bare the nerves and arteries . ''

		Unleavened Bread , '' considered as a story , is an account of the career of one ambitious woman ; all of its other characters are of minor importance , and have little interest for us .

		Con - sidered as a social study , the book is a quiet and effective satire upon American democracy , that is , upon the pretensions of the democratic spirit to reach valid conclusions by the aid of its own un - tutored instincts , upon its tendency to substitute catchwords for ideas , and to be deceived by its own phrases .

		The satire is effective precisely because it is both quiet and restrained ; the writer is too conscientious an artist to put violent colors upon his canvas .

		Among the special subjects of his satire are the notions of art and of education , of society and of politics , that prevail in our middle-class American life .

		The notions of art , for example , that make our large cities a medley of incongruous architectural styles and that erect grotesque statues in our public places ; the notions of education that place our schools in the hands of ignorant men and fill them with untrained teachers ; the notions of society that exalt showiness above refinement , and extravagance above simplicity ; the notions of poli - tics that make sincerity an almost impossible virtue in public life and that blunt both the intellect and the moral sense .

		This seems a rather heavy pro- gramme for a work of fiction , and the book itself , if not exactly heavy , certainly does not come within the category of light reading .

		It opens in a man - ner somewhat suggestive of such a book as the '' Modern Instance '' of Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, then it seems to suggest something of the moralizing atmosphere of Mr.
Warner	PERSON	's group of three novels , but in the final impression it stands out as a work of distinc - tively original type .

		The ambitious woman about whom all the interest centres , and who is so marked an embodiment of the crudities , the self-deceptions , and the ill-directed aims that are characteristic of many of our men and women alike , is a figure drawn with extraordinary intellectual detachment , and , it must be admitted , has little of the flesh and blood that are needed to make such a figure really vital .

		We follow her career with curious interest , but we feel all the time that she is a puppet , with the strings always in the author 's hand .

		The vital characters of fiction do not leave us with this impression ; they seem in a way to pass beyond the control of the writer , and to act of their own mo - tion .

		In this respect Mr.
Grant	PERSON	's heroine is a failure , his book is a failure in this sense also , but it is nevertheless a remarkable piece of workmanship , relatively speaking , and judged with reference to its limitations .

		One of the many morals of Mr.
Grant	PERSON	's novel is that a man knows very little about his wife until they have been married for a considerable length of time .

		This rather trite observation is enforced in '' Unleavened Bread '' with so much impressive - ness that it gains a deeper meaning than it is wont to have .

		In '' The Action and the Word , '' the latest novel of Mr.
Brander Matthews	PERSON	, the idea is again illustrated , although in this case it affords matter for comedy rather than for tragedy , or even for serious dramatic effect .

		We have here the story of a
New York	LOCATION	architect and his wife .

		The wife is a charming woman with a marked aptitude for amateur theatricals .

		Her acting wins such applause that her head is almost turned , and she seems upon the point of abandoning domestic life for the ex - citements of the stage .

		Happily , her better judg - ment triumphs and she gives up the notion , but her husband has been startled out of his complacency , and the novelist has been provided with the ma - terial for a pretty story .

		The story is not deep , certainly , but it exhibits keen insight and deft work - manship .

		It proves exceptionally entertaining , which is probably all that the writer expected of it . ''


Robert Tournay	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
William Sage	PERSON	, is a conventional romance of the French Revolution , one of the many books that find their prototype in '' Mademoiselle de la Seigliere . ''

		There is the usual noble family , with its selfish aristocratic prejudices , and the usual fair daughter , who has a heart as well as a title .

		There is also the usual man of the people , who dares to love the daughter of his aris - tocratic master , and to whom the Revolution brings the usual opportunities for protecting the woman whom he loves from her enemies , and for rescuing her from imminent death .

		As is usually the case in novels of this sort , we are told about the destruc - tion of the
Bastile	LOCATION	, the burning of a chateau , and the horrors of a Republican noyade on the
Loire	LOCATION	.

		We have also the familiar story of Republican vic - tories on the frontier , and of the Terror in
Paris	LOCATION	.


Robespierre	LOCATION	and
Danton	PERSON	are both here , likewise the Conciergerie and the tumbrils and the guillotine .

		We have read it all many times before , but its in - 126 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, terest seems perennial , and we have no fault to find with the author for inviting us to read it again .

		When we are confronted with such a title as '' The Black Terror : A Romance of
Russia	LOCATION	, '' we at once know what to expect .

		There will be nihilists and dungeons and conspiracies and reprisals and brutal governors and sinister officers of the
Third Section	ORGANIZATION	.

		There will also be a lovely heroine who will aid the hero in some hairbreadth escape .

		In the case of the present novel , the work of Mr.
John K. Leys	PERSON	, we are not disappointed in any of these expectations , and we have besides the story of an ingenious plot , successfully carried out , to kidnap the Tsar , and keep him in close confinement until he grants to his subjects the desired Constitution .

		Mrs.
Edith Wharton	PERSON	's second book of fiction is not a collection of stories , like '' The Greater Incli - nation , '' but a single novel .

		Yet '' The Touchstone , '' although we must call it a novel , has really no more substance than one of the briefer sketches .

		It is the story of a single incident , and of its influence upon the lives of a man and his wife .

		It is a story that might easily have been told in fifty pages ; the hundred additional pages that are given us merely serve to permit of a more detailed analysis of the situation created by a single thoughtless act .

		Yet we would not spare from the story a single page , for the writer 's art is so exquisite that no one of her pages seems superfluous , or fails in its contribu - tion to the deep impressiveness of her psychological study .

		If the book has a defect , that defect must be sought in the central conception , and not in the treatment .

		The hero has in his possession a great many letters , of the most intimate character , written to him by a woman who had loved him all her life , but whom he had been incapable of loving in re - turn .

		That woman had become a famous writer , and , after her death , anything that could throw light upon her personality was eagerly demanded by the public .

		The recipient of the letters , learning of this demand , and for lack of money unable to marry the woman he loves , actually sells this sacred correspondence to a publisher , suppressing his own name , and thereby removes the obstacle to his mar - riage .

		When he realizes what he has done he be - comes remorseful , and Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	's purpose is to direct our attention to the workings of his con - science , to excite our sympathies for his sufferings .

		In this she is imperfectly successful , for it would tax the powers of the greatest novelist that ever lived to be entirely successful in such a task .

		The act in question is so despicable that no motive would seem adequate for its justification , no cir - cumstances could be found more than palliating in the case of such an offense .

		Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	's treat - ment of this theme is all that we might desire , but it can not give us a genuinely sympathetic interest in fcuch a person as her hero .

		We can not help feel - ing that he deserves even more than he suffers , and we remain suspicious of any moral regeneration that is brought about by means of his remorse .

		Yet it is the clear intention of the writer to have us ac - cept this moral regeneration as a fact , and to for - give the offender as his own deceived wife forgives him in the end .

		In a word , the substance of this book is of a kind to repel rather than to attract ; what does attract , and even fascinate , is the delicacy of texture and the distinction of style which the work exhibits .

		Whatever we may think of Mrs.
Atherton	PERSON	's '' Senator North , '' it would never occur to us to ac - cord it the attributes of delicacy and distinction .

		In the place of the one it has a sort of rude energy ; in the place of the other it has a form of expression which is rough in sound and crude in coloring , which is positively repellant to a refined sense .

		Here is a sentence fairly representative of its style . ''

		In ordinary conditions politics are barely men - tioned when the most political city in the world is in evening dress , but war is a microbe . ''

		The in - eptitude of that metaphor would be hard to match .

		Mrs.
Atherton	PERSON	's novel deals with the social and po - litical life of
Washington	LOCATION	at the present day .

		The heroine is a young woman of aristocratic breeding , who becomes weary of the whole empty round of the life of a self-styled '' society , '' and who makes up her mind to go in for politics .

		To the horror of her family , she actually cultivates the acquaintance of Representatives and Senators , and starts a sort of salon for the furtherance of her new-found inter - ests .

		The one conspicuous result of this activity is the fact that she falls in love with
Senator North	ORGANIZATION	, a statesman of sixty , who has an invalid wife .

		This unnatural passion is reciprocated , and neither of the two parties concerned seems to have any par - ticularly conscientious scruples , although both have a lively sense of the desirability of escaping dis - covery .

		In the end , the invalid wife opportunely dies , and conventional morality is spared any further outrage .

		Incidentally , the story makes much of two matters of social and political interest .

		The former is the ostracism placed by American prejudice upon any woman who has a drop of negro blood in her veins .

		This matter is dealt with in the most mor - bid and sensational manner possible .

		The latter is the state of affairs which led to our recent war with
Spain	LOCATION	, and in her treatment of this subject the writer displays an unexpected sanity , and exhibits a rather remarkable intellectual grasp of the situa - tion .

		Both the unreasoning frenzy which precipi - tated that war , and the dangerous sequelce of its conclusion , are set forth with an ethical perception that is entirely just , and that contrasts strikingly with the other ethical ideals of the book .

		Mr.
H. B. Marriott Watson	PERSON	's latest novel , '' The Rebel , '' turns from the imaginary history wherein his invention has of late been exercised to the actual history of
England	LOCATION	in the time of Charles II .

		It takes the form of a memoir of the fourth
Earl of Cherwell	ORGANIZATION	, written by his cousin , and leading up to an account of the ri ` sing at
Taunton	LOCATION	in
1684	DATE	.

		The hero is a noble swashbuckler who has no hesitation in setting the laws at defiance , and whose audacity fairly takes our breath away .

		He contrives to stand
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 127 well with the
King	PERSON	, who has a certain admiration for his recklessness , but he is the declared enemy of the
Duke of York	ORGANIZATION	, whose shameful persecution of the heroine leaves him indeed no room for respect .

		The heroine is a gentle creature , who serves well enough as a foil for her fiery and turbulent defender , but who has otherwise slight claim upon our interest .

		It is needless to say that the
Duke	ORGANIZATION	's villainy comes to naught , and that the heroine is rescued from the manifold perils that beset her .

		The plot of the narrative is at first confused and difficult to follow , but the complications are gradually cleared away , and it takes a straightforward course to the close .

		The story is told forcibly and with brilliant ani - mation .

		Mr.
Frederick W. Hayes	PERSON	is a new writer to us , but he deserves well of the novel-reading public .

		His ''
Kent Squire	PERSON	'' is a historical romance of the time of Queen
Anne	PERSON	and the
Duke of Harlborough	ORGANIZATION	.

		The latter personage figures prominently in the his - tory , and his duplicity is depicted with an unsparing hand .

		French and Spanish political intrigue , as well as English , make up a large part of the his - torical substance of this highly exciting narrative .

		Indeed , the canvas is so crowded with figures and dramatic situations that the reader becomes almost dazed in his attempt to keep track of all the per - sonal and public interests at stake .

		That this task proves too much for the writer himself is evident in the closing chapters , for with respect to some of its leading issues the story is not ended at all , it sim - ply stops .

		Most of the incidents are legitimate enough for this sort of sensational romance , but credulity is strained beyond the breaking-point when the hero reappears upon the scene after having been hanged by the public executioner , and afterwards suspended in chains upon the gibbet .

		So violent a wrench to the feelings might have been spared us without serious difficulty , and we might also have been spared the apparition of the condemned man to his sweetheart some hundreds of miles away .

		Aside from these two constructive defects , the story is to be commended for both its invention and its acquaintance with the period in question .

		It is evident that the writer has done a great deal of '' reading up '' for his work , that he has delved into the memoirs of the age , instead of remaining content , as most historical novelists do , with the superficial knowledge of the text-books .

		Mr.
Max Pemberton	PERSON	's '' Fe `` o '' is the romance of a singer in French opera and an Austrian prince .

		The heroine is the daughter of a decayed gentle - man who cares for little save his own personal comfort , and is not above the meanness of trading upon his daughter 's beauty .

		The rank of the hero naturally hedges him about with all sorts of barriers to the accomplishment of his wishes , and the story tells us how he has his way in the end , in spite of all the diplomatic locksmiths .

		It is a story of intrigues and duels and abductions , a little melodramatic in manner , infused with sentiment , and sparkling with interest .

		No one will regret having read it , and no one will remember anything about it a year afterwards .

		Mr.
E. F. Benson	PERSON	, in `` The Princess Sophia , '' again exhibits his versatility .

		The book may be described as standing midway between the frivolity of '' Dodo '' and the seriousness of his two Greek novels .

		The new story is the next thing to being Greek itself , for it is about the principality of
Rhodope	LOCATION	* , which lies , '' as everyone knows , on the wooded coast-line of
Albania	LOCATION	. ''

		It tells about the politics of this extremely interesting imaginary
State	ORGANIZATION	, and describes the attempt of
Petros	PERSON	, the hus - band of the Princess , acting as regent in her ab - sence from the capital , to subvert the government , and get secure possession of the reins of power .

		The thwarting of this plot provides the story with a really thrilling climax , although the spirit of the book throughout is that of refined comedy rather than of anything more serious .

		The interest of the story is concentrated in the character of the
Prin	PERSON	- cess , and her passion for gambling , which leads her to the very brink of disaster , and which has a most demoralizing influence upon her subjects .

		Mr.
S. R. Crockett	PERSON	has now close upon a score of romances to his credit , and there is no reason why he should not make the number twoscore within a few years .

		He evidently writes with the ease of a
Dumas	PERSON	, and his invention never seems to flag .

		Two of his books are now before us : one a romance of the fifteenth century , entitled `` Joan of the Sword Hand '' ; the other a more modern tale of his own
Scotland	LOCATION	and of the
West Indies	LOCATION	, entitled '' The Isle of the Winds . ''

		Both stories abound in pic - turesque incident and exciting adventure , both are about as unreal as stories of the sort can possibly be , and both are fairly reeking with sentimentality .

		The latter of the two has , we observe , been pre - viously published with another title .

		In writing '' The Minx , '' Mrs.
Mannington Caffyn	PERSON	has determined to be `` smart '' at any cost .

		Her epigrams have the air of being profoundly philosophical , and the conversation of her characters fairly coruscates with intellectual brilliancy .

		She never permits one of them to express even a com - monplace idea without giving it a verbal turn that seems impressive until we look closely enough to detect its emptiness .

		In a word , the style of the book is simply intolerable , and the story has not intrinsic interest enough to be worth disentangle - ment from all the verbiage which invests it .

		It is about a young woman who takes life with intense seriousness and does not know which of two lovers to accept .

		The one satisfies her intellectual ideals , but the other appeals to the just-awakening emo - tional side of her nature .

		Eventually , the heart triumphs over the head , and her final choice rests upon the warm-hearted fox-hunting country gentle - man whose whole way of looking at life stands in violent contrast to the abstract ideals which she has hitherto held sacred .

		A novel published last year by Mrs.
Henry Dudeney	PERSON	forced us to condemn the uncompromising 128 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, realism of the writer both with respect to choice of subject and to treatment in spite of the mani - fest power of the book . ''

		Folly Corner , '' a second story by the same writer , is less open to objection , and it is possible for praise to balance blame , if not actually to outweigh it .

		There is still much un - necessary insistence upon unlovely and squalid details , and some unnecessary obtrusion of those phases of life concerning which no writer can be too reticent , but there is also a sombre power to envisage the tragical side of everyday life which goes far to redeem the grossness of the writer 's naturalism .

		We read this book with something of the feeling aroused by the later books of Mr.
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	, a feeling in which admiration for undeniable talent is all the time struggling with impatience of a perverse method .

		This suggestion of Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	is no mere fancy , for he is certainly the master whom Mrs.
Dudeney	PERSON	would acknowledge among the writers of to-day .

		The second half of '' Knights of the Cross , '' by Mr.
Henryk Sienkiewicz	PERSON	, carries on the story of the struggle between
Poland	LOCATION	and the Teutonic Knights , ending with the battle of
Grtlnwald	ORGANIZATION	and the final overthrow of the Order .

		This climax is not without impressiveness , yet its effect is far from equal to that of several episodes to be found in the author 's earlier trilogy of Polish history .

		It does not begin to stir the blood as the siege of Chensto - hova , for example , stirs it .

		Nor does Zbyshko make as satisfactory a hero as Kmita or
Pan Michael	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is a great deal of fighting in the book , but it grows rather monotonous , and is not diversified by such feats of individual prowess as hold us spellbound in the romances of the earlier series .

		Nor is there any figure for a moment com - parable with that pf
Zagloba	LOCATION	, which must stand as the greatest of the author 's creative triumphs .

		It is only in comparison with the author 's own best that the present romance suffers .

		Were it our introduction to his genius , we should find it difficult to praise sufficiently the historical pageant which it unfolds , its simple strong-souled figures swayed by primitive passions , its brilliant invention , and its racy humor .

		But all of these things are exhibited to much better advantage in the great trilogy , and we fear that Mr.
Sienkiewicz	PERSON	will not again reach the level of that colossal work .

		Still another of Mr.
Jokai	PERSON	's novels has been translated for us , the selection this time being '' The
Baron	PERSON	's Sons , '' and the translator Mr.
Percy Favor Bicknell	PERSON	.

		Some abridgements have been made , for which a very lame excuse is offered , but otherwise the translation is satisfactory .

		The story is con - cerned with the Hungarian Revolution of
1848	DATE	, and combines the use of historical material with domestic incidents in a happy and interesting fashion .

		The thread of the narrative is a little difficult to follow , which is probably due in part to the liberties taken by the translator .

		On the whole , the story is one of the author 's best , as far as they have been trans - lated , and does not strain our credulity as much as some of its predecessors have done .

		A few words about two recent translations from the Spanish may be given in closing this review . ''

		Currita , Countess of Albornoz '' is the work of a Jesuit priest ,
Senor Luis Coloma	ORGANIZATION	by name .

		It is a novel of
Madrid	LOCATION	society about thirty years ago , and is concerned with political intrigue as well as with the doings of the fashionable world .

		The author - ship of the work leads us to expect a strong infu - sion of clericalism , in which we are not disappointed ; but the foremost aim of the novelist is to draw a picture of social corruption rather than to play the part of the avowed preacher , and he brings to this task the full equipment of an experienced observer and a master of incisive and caustic speech .

		The work is rather shapeless as a whole , but it has much brilliant detail , and its moral lesson is made all the sharper for being left rather implicit than out - spoken .

		It is clear that we are all the time in con - tact with a richly cultured mind , and this gives so much satisfaction to the reader of discernment that the amateurish character of the artistic perform - ance may easily be overlooked .

		We could wish that a better English version of the work had been given us .

		The translator seems to have a fair knowledge of Spanish , but she is all at sea in the presence of the scholarly allusions and foreign proper names with which the novel is plentifully sprinkled . ''

		The Joy of Captain Ribot '' is not only an in - teresting novel , it is also a work of gracious and exquisite art .

		Although it has for its theme the love of a man for a woman already married , it is at once so delicate and so noble in its treatment that the author 's own claim is justified when he calls it , in a private letter , '' a protest from the depths against the eternal adultery of the French novel . ''

		For the `` joy '' of its hero is not eo much in his love as in the moral triumph which keeps that love unsullied , and rises victorious above every tempta - tion .

		So clean and wholesome a work rarely comes to us from a novelist of Latin race ; its idealism makes not the slightest compromise with evil , and in its spirituality there is no base admixture .

		Yet with all this exultation of sentiment , the story is convincingly real ; it is a story of everyday people , and of life unfalsified by rose-colored glasses .

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	is entirely right when he describes the book as `` a novel of manners , the modern manners of provincial
Spain	LOCATION	'' ; and when he adds that '' while we were spoiling our prostrate foe , I wish we could have got some of these , '' he expresses a feeling that must be stirring in many an American conscience , now that we are starting on the painful path of recovery from our national military de - bauch .

		It is certainly difficult to find words ad - equate to express the admirable qualities of this latest of the novels of Sefior Valde 's , or of the genius of the nation that can boast the possession of such writers .

		THE DIAL 129 BRIEFS BOOKS .

		We have had , of recent years , some New text-books in r i , r .

		i i .

		T - < English literature .

		fa .

		irl y satisfactory text-books in En - glish literature , but there is room for improvement in the best of them , and we are glad to observe the appearance of several new com - petitors for the favor of educators .

		Among the many books upon this subject which we have exam - ined , we are inclined to give the palm to the '' History of English Literature '' -LRB-
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- re - cently prepared by Mr.
Reuben Post Halleck	PERSON	.

		For selection and arrangement of material , for usefulness of pictorial illustration , and for its happy faculty of saying just the right thing about a given author or work , it would be difficult to improve upon this text .

		It provides a continuous and interesting his - tory of our literature , and contrives to keep a middle course between the dry summary on the one hand , and the discursive essay on the other .

		The writer believes thoroughly in teaching the his - tory of the subject as well as in taking up the study of individual works .

		He justly says : '' Various masterpieces seem like unconnected islands in an unexplored ocean .

		There is no way of making these masterpieces seem otherwise except by teach - ing the history and development of the literature of which they form a part . ''

		The apparatus of this book , with its directions for required and optional reading and its suggestive questions and exercises , is remarkably good .

		One feature of particular in - terest is the literary map of
England	LOCATION	which serves as a frontispiece .

		We take great pleasure in com - mending this work to the attention of teachers .

		A literary map also accompanies the '' History of English Literature '' -LRB-
Sibley & Ducker	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- which Professor
F. V. N. Painter	PERSON	has recently published .

		This book is an expansion of the writer 's earlier `` Introduction , '' and deals at length with nearly twice as many authors .

		Eight periods are recog - nized , and to each of them a considerable chapter is devoted .

		The method employed is that of writing an essay upon each period as a whole , and then dealing in considerable detail with a few selected writers .

		Thirty - two authors altogether , from Chaucer to
Ruskin	LOCATION	, are thus singled out for some - what elaborate treatment .

		This method has the obvious defect of giving other great writers much less than their due in the history of our literature .

		We can not entirely approve of a work that relegates Fielding in the Queen Anne period ,
Burke	PERSON	in the Johnsonian period , and
Keats	PERSON	in the Romantic period , to the position of minor writers .

		The au - thor 's style is too discursive to be in the best sense practical .

		His essays make pleasant reading , but they do not make the most satisfactory sort of teaching material .

		He is the kind of writer , more - over , who speaks of '' female poets , '' and who calls Byron '' immoral . ''

		Such infelicities of diction and characterization have a slightly jarring effect , and do not commend the writer to persons of nice judg - ment .

		A third recent text-book upon this subject is the '' Outline History of English and American Literature '' -LRB-
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- written by Dr.
Charles F. Johnson	PERSON	.

		The writer 's object has been '' to compress into this book the minimum of what every young person should know of the literature of his own country and
England	LOCATION	, even if his educa - tion is strictly scientific . ''

		The author recognizes ten periods in the history of English literature , but preserves the sense of proportion in dealing with the writers of each of the periods .

		In spite of the fact that he deals with both English and American literature in a single volume , he finds room for numerous extracts , many of them of considerable length .

		The book is remarkably well written , and will be welcomed by teachers who find their English courses unduly limited by the pressure of other subjects upon the curriculum .

		Memoirs of a
John Adams	PERSON	, the
New England New England	LOCATION	schoolmaster , was a man '' of the old school '' both in character and educa - tional methods .

		Born in
1772	DATE	and dying in
1863	DATE	, his life touched the two greatest of our national experiences , and covered the period of our estab - lishment as an independent and united nation .

		Through his influence upon thousands of young men who , at
Phillips Academy	ORGANIZATION	, at
Andover	LOCATION	, and other schools , were under his care , Mr.
Adams	PERSON	bore an honorable part in the work of upbuilding the country .

		The list of prominent men trained at
Andover	LOCATION	dur - ing the twenty-two years he was its principal is a long one .


Oliver Wendell Holmes	PERSON	was one of them , and has given in his verses many pictures of the life there .

		He refers to Mr.
Adams	PERSON	in the well - known lines : '' Uneasy lie the heads of all that rule , His most of all whose kingdom is a school . ''

		While Mr.
Adams	PERSON	will be chiefly remembered as principal of
Andover Academy	LOCATION	, to many he is an interesting figure as the father of the brilliant
New York	LOCATION	minister , Reverend
William Adams	PERSON	; to others , as a pioneer missionary of the
S. S. Union	ORGANIZATION	in
Illi	PERSON	- nois ; to others still , as one of the original circle of philanthropists from whose labors grew the Amer - ican Tract Society and the Temperance movement .

		He was a man of profound religious convictions and a high sense of spiritual obligations .

		His character had no complexity or uncertainties .

		It was built about one simple all-controlling quality , '' devoted - ness to duty '' ; it had but one simple unchanging aim , to serve God and his generation .

		Contact with such a nature , in life or in books , is refreshing .

		In bringing before the reader this strong and useful life , the authors of the well - written memoir of Mr.
Adams	PERSON	recently published -LRB- Scribner -RRB- give also an entertaining and valuable picture of the character - istics and educational methods of a
New England	LOCATION	academy .

		It is this portrayal , together with the in - teresting associations of his long life , that give to this memoir more than a private value .

		The book is noticeably well printed and bound , and evinces good taste throughout .

		130 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, The volume of '' Liberty Poems '' -LRB- J < * e8
H. West Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which has been compiled in the interest of the anti-imperialist agitation , ought to prove an effective auxiliary in the cause of justice and public morality , now at stake as only once before in the history of our country .

		It is a collection of about seventy-five pieces of verse , written by various hands in various manners , and inspired by a common indignation at the attempted subversion of the fundamental prin - ciples of our government .

		We wish it were possible to say that all of these poems rose to the height of their great occasion .

		But most of them belong to the category of newspaper verse , hastily written by persons having no special aptitude for the poetic art .

		If
Lowell	PERSON	and
Whittier	LOCATION	and
Emerson	PERSON	were still alive , a very different collection would be possible ; for who could doubt that their voices would again be raised in behalf of human freedom , as they were so effectively raised fifty years ago ?

		As it is , very few of the names signed to these pieces have any literary significance whatever .

		The best poems in the collection are Mr.
William Lloyd Garrison	PERSON	's thirteen sonnets , Mr.
W. C. Gannett	PERSON	's '' At the
Peace Congress	ORGANIZATION	, '' Miss Baskam 's '' The Voice of the Lord , '' and a selection from Mr.
William Vaughn Moody	PERSON	's noble '' Ode in
Time of Hesitation	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		We must find room for one quotation , and it shall be Mr.
Garrison	PERSON	's tribute to Governor
Boutwell	PERSON	, that venerable and venerated statesman , the representative of a vanishing type , who has de - clared himself with no uncertain voice to stand upon the side of
Washington	LOCATION	and
Jefferson	PERSON	and
Lincoln	LOCATION	in the present crisis : '' Not thine the sadness of an outlived fame , Nor fate to lag superfluous on the stage : Thou addest only strength to ripest age , And lustre to a lifelong honored name .

		In a degenerate day , when public shame And private avarice stain the nation 's page , When sordid ends the growing youth engage , Thy burning words are like a torch of flame .

		New England glories in thy manhood rare , Which , breaking party shackles , stands erect And breathing deeply of diviner air , Enrolls thy name among the great elect .

		Thy topmost boughs the richest leafage bear , Thy latest fruit compels the world 's respect . ''

		The records of a long and useful life .

		^ ne wno * 8 interested in genealogical investigations learns to avail himself o f a u gor t ; 8 o f scraps of information .

		He also has frequent occasion to express regret that some individual who knew many facts of family history died without leaving any record of them .

		It is not every genealogist , however , who is able to write the story of his own life , in order that no fu - ture family historian may have occasion to blame him for omitting to preserve details of possible in - terest to descendants .

		The love of genealogy led to the publication , by General
Roeliff Brinkerhoff	PERSON	, of
Mansfield	LOCATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	, of his '' Recollections of a Life - time '' -LRB-
Robert Clarke Company	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		For years Mr.
Brinkerhoff	PERSON	has been a recognized leader of move - ments having for their purpose the improvement of the condition of criminals and unfortunates , and in this capacity he has been interested in
National Congresses of Charities	ORGANIZATION	and Corrections ,
National Prison Congresses	ORGANIZATION	, and in many state movements .

		The most valuable chapters in the volume are those which are taken up with discussions of these mat - ters .

		For the most part , the life described is that of the average man , who , as school-teacher , lawyer , or soldier , plays well his part in the social circles of his home city , is honored and respected by his neighbors and friends , and by reason of years of faithful `` adherence to the principles of right living makes himself a place in his day and generation .

		The story will , of course , have most interest for those who have known the author during his long and useful life .

		Summary of the A summary , in chronological order , jurisprudence of the principal features of the juris - of the world .

		prudence of the leading peoples of the world , has been prepared by Professor Guy
Carleton Lee	PERSON	, of
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	, and published under the title '' Historical Jurispru - dence '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Finding `` the foundations of law '' in the jurisprudence of
Babylonia	LOCATION	,
Egypt	LOCATION	,
Israel	LOCATION	, and
India	LOCATION	, the author exhibits `` the develop - ment of jurisprudence '' as displayed in the Roman systems of law , to which over a third of his less than two hundred pages are appropriately devoted .

		The great work of Justinian is explained at some length , and the projections of the Roman Law into mediaeval times are illustrated under the titles of the ''
Canon	ORGANIZATION	Law '' and the '' Barbarian Codes . ''

		The survival of the elaborate Roman system in modern times is traced into the laws of the western continental states of
Europe	LOCATION	, and the laws of
Scot	PERSON	- land , in which it secured permanent position .

		The book closes with an account of the introduction of the principles of the civil law into the jurisprudence of
England	LOCATION	.

		From the evidences of customary law furnished by the unearthed contract-tablets of Baby - lonia , to the early commentaries on the law of
England	LOCATION	, runs the curriculum of this new study in jurisprudence , on the comparative historical plan .

		The book is full of meat , and though intended as '' an introduction to the systematic study of the de - velopment of law '' -LRB- see title-page -RRB- it will prove of much interest to all students of general history .

		The memories of a man who has y ^ sssa Hved much and has the art f teiiin g about it gracefully can hardly fail to be entertaining .

		Mr.
H. Sutherland Edwards	PERSON	, in his `` Personal Recollections '' -LRB-
Cassell	PERSON	-RRB- , has given us the record of a long and rich experience , and has told the tale with an easy flow of narrative that takes one swiftly and pleasantly from story to story .

		Mr.
Edwards	PERSON	has clearly enjoyed living , for other - wise the incidents that gave life form and color for him could not have impressed themselves upon his memory with such sure distinctness , they are so many and sometimes so slight .

		THE DIAL , 131 sudden transition to the inconsequential gives the reader an unpleasant sensation . ''

		I have no doubt that the military type-setter was well paid .

		Herzen was a generous man , and had abundant private means .

		He called his paper the
Bell	ORGANIZATION	and he had himself a voice like a bell , musical and sonorous . ''

		But perhaps these things merely authenticate the record to something more than artificiality in the glow of a fresh and lively remembrance .

		Mr.
Edwards	PERSON	's memories , as he makes note of them , are largely of persons rather than events , artists , musicians , statesmen , Russian , and Italian revolu - tionaries , actors and managers .

		Tennyson and
Browning	PERSON	figure in the pages , von Billow ,
Wagner	PERSON	,
Verdi	ORGANIZATION	,
Macready	PERSON	,
Lewes	LOCATION	,
Reade	LOCATION	,
Thackeray	PERSON	, and a host of lesser men of various abilities and more or less interesting personalities .


Douglas Jerrold	PERSON	's caustic wit and the more genial pleasantries of others known to fame brighten the pages abun - dantly , and the running comment on men and man - ners that makes up the thick volume has the sparkle of brilliant conversation , if it has also at times the scrappiness into which such conversation may lapse .

		There is in the book no serious dealing with the men and women upon whose lives it touches , but in anecdote and in side-lights upon character it is dis - tinctly rich and entertaining .

		It was the '' Father of Angling '' ?

		* ho lon S a g ^ marked on the diffi - culty of teaching '' the Art of Catch - ing Fish , that is to say , how to make a Man that was none , to be an Angler by a book . ''

		Never - theless ,
Isaak Walton	PERSON	has left us a piscatorial as well as a literary classic .

		But the '' Compleat Angler '' was written for other lands and days .

		Americans who love and practice this fascinating form of recreation will find Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	's vol - ume on '' Familiar Fish '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- replete from cover to cover with fisherman 's lore from the pen of one of their successful confreres .

		Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	writes with the spirit of the true sportsman , and those who would learn the art will find in his book a sympathetic account of the life and haunts of our fresh-water game fish .

		Details of rods and tackle , and counsel as to fly-casting , with suggestions for outfits and for the conduct of camp-life , make the book a valuable one for all campers and sportsmen .

		The ichthyological references have been supervised by President
David Starr Jordan	PERSON	, whose facile pen also contributes a prefatory note which discusses the raison d' etre of angling and the comparative ethics of '' hog-fishing '' and piscatorial prevarica - tions .

		The meditation * of
Ifc	ORGANIZATION	is a Volume f 8OUnd and thought - a prelate and a ful essay s and addresses that Bishop student of affairs , gpalding presents us under the gen - eral title of '' Opportunity , and Other Essays '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- .

		Showing on every page the marks of the scholar and the thinker , they are vitalized by the fine earnestness of a broad vision of life and a noble enthusiasm for the good it has to offer .

		Bishop Spalding is no narrow churchman or pedant , and the breath of the larger needs of life and its larger activities gives a bracing atmosphere to the volume .

		In the opening essay , which gives its title to the book , there is perhaps the finer flavor , a suggestion of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	in style and hardly less in the quality of rapt prescience in the mysteries of life and its possibilities .

		There are eight chapters in all , rang - ing in theme from ''
The University	ORGANIZATION	, A Nursery of the Higher Life '' and '' Goethe as Educator '' to '' Empire or Republic . ''

		This last address , and the one preceding it in the book , are words for the times to give us thoughtful pause ; but for that reason , it may be , their literary charm is perhaps less distinct and enjoyable .

		For its stimulus to the living of the life that is worth while , for its clear and wholesome doctrine of optimistic endeavor , packed to almost epigrammatic fulness , the little volume is well worth reading and well worth having at hand for the idle moment when a page or two of kindly wisdom is a pleasing tonic .

		wuiiam
Watson The Catholic Apostolic	ORGANIZATION	movement has
Andrew	PERSON	passed more and more into obscurity .

		It was one of the movements which never greatly appealed to the popular mind or heart .

		But it appealed to many rare minds and noble characters , of whom a memorial volume on
William Watson Andrews	PERSON	-LRB-
Putnam	LOCATION	-RRB- recalls one .


William Watson Andrews	PERSON	was the Congregational minister of Kent ,
Connecticut	LOCATION	, when he came under the influence of the new teaching and found him - self in growing sympathy with it .

		He believed that it was the will of God to meet the needs of the time by a revival of the
Apostolate	LOCATION	.

		Nothing could be of a finer spirit than the words in which he finally asked dismission from the church in which he had been reared .

		The same spirit seemed only to be heightened by the adversities and isolation which followed his entrance into the new fold .

		He never gained the ear of the public , nor was he greatly successful in propagating the new creed , but throughout his life his was a friendship prized by some of the foremost of our intellectual and spirit - ual leaders , and in that circle he was always a power by reason of his personality , his learning , and his great spiritual gifts .

		The memorial volume is an interesting and valuable one .

		A new volume Xt is always a pleasure to record the in Mr.
Murray	PERSON	's appearance of the successive volumes edition of Byron .

		of Mr
Murray	PERSON	's excellent edition of Byron -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		The volume before us , the third of the poetry , contains the metrical tales which confirmed
Byron	PERSON	's fame after the great success of ''
Childe Harold	PERSON	, '' together with the miscellaneous pieces of the same period .

		The numerous notes gratifyingly confirm one 's impression of the taste , vigilance , and precision of Mr.
Coleridge	PERSON	, who is earning the admiration of students and the grati - tude of the poet 's lovers .

		This volume contains six full-page illustrations , the most interesting of these 132 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	,
King Alfred	PERSON	's '' best book '' in being a reproduction of
Hayter	PERSON	's handsome drawing of Mrs.
Leigh	PERSON	-LRB- `` Augusta '' -RRB- .

		The qualities of this edition we have enlarged upon in preceding num - bers of THE DIAL : they are such that it must supersede all others , irrespective of the considerable amount of new material it contains .

		We wish Mr.
Coleridge	PERSON	good speed in the great task of editing ``
Don Juan	PERSON	, '' which he regards as
Byron	PERSON	's `` great - est work . ''

		The illustration of a poem so wide - ranging and various must severely tax the resources of the most accomplished editor .

		The coming year is the millenary of the death of
King Alfred	LOCATION	, and to its modem English .

		ce i e b ra tion Mr.
Walter John Sedge	PERSON	- field makes a highly acceptable contribution by publishing , through the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	, a modern English translation of ''
King Alfred	PERSON	's Version of the Consolations of Boethius . ''

		Mr.
Sedgefield	PERSON	has previously edited the Old English text of this '' best book '' of the King of the
West Saxons	LOCATION	, and his present work is thus a sort of sup - plement to his earlier one .

		The alliterative verses of the original are reproduced in Old English metre , and printed together at the end of the volume .

		In the body of the text , the editor has distinguished by means of italics the additions made by
Alfred	PERSON	to the work of the Roman philosopher .

		This is a particu - larly interesting feature of the translation , for it enables us to follow the very workings of
Alfred	PERSON	's mind as he labored for the instruction and moral welfare of his subjects .

		The editor 's introduction is valuable , and includes specimen extracts from the preceding English versions of Boethius .

		Newly edited Professor
W. P. Ker	PERSON	has put all critical writings students of English literature , and cf
John Dryden	PERSON	.

John Dryden	PERSON	'' for the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		The work occupies two volumes , and includes the bulk of
Dryden	PERSON	's critical writings , together with a commentary and extensive notes . ''

		It is not meant to take the place of Scott or of
Malone	PERSON	; but may serve as a conven - ient book for reference , to be used especially by such readers as are interested in criticism and the history of criticism , and who may be glad to have
Dryden	PERSON	's critical opinions put before them in a form adapted for ready consultation and compari - son . ''

		In all cases but one , the text has been col - lated with the original editions ; but the editor has thought it best to modernize the spelling and give uniformity to the punctuation .

		The scholarship of the author of '' Epic and Romance '' needs no cer - tificate , and it is a matter of course that he has done his editorial work in an admirable way .

		For unprotected The American woman going abroad American women for the first time and without a man going abroad .

Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by
Mary Cadwallader Jones	PERSON	, worth its weight in gold .

		In it the thousand and one anxious queries that rise to the lips of the unpro - tected female tourist after she is fairly '' in the thick of it '' are answered in advance in a most practical and satisfactory way .

		As the author states it , the book is '' intended especially for the use of women , to suggest what they had better take with them in going abroad for the first time , and to tell them how they can get about most comfortably after landing . ''

		Special chapters deal with travel in
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	, and
Italy	LOCATION	, respect - ively ; and there is a table of well-selected useful foreign phrases .

		In short , the woman who has mastered the contents of this little manual may venture on the unknown sea of European travel with a comparatively light heart .

Hector Macpherson	PERSON	essays not only '' to present to the general reader Spencerism in lucid , coherent shape , '' but to convey in outline some knowledge of the career and personality of the author of the system .

		The book was under - taken with Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	's approval ; and while it is , as it should be , the work of a disciple of his , it is not that of a slavish one .

		Mr.
Macpherson	PERSON	is a good expositor , and something more than an ex - positor , his work showing throughout a rather critical bias a tendency to collate and classify philosoph - ical ideas , as well as merely to elucidate them and simplify the form of their original expression .

		As an essay in
Spencerism	LOCATION	, the book is decidedly sug - gestive , and the general reader will find it helpful on its expository side .

		Educators will note with interest the appearance of a life of the late ''
Joel Dorman Steele	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Barnes	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mrs.
George Archibald	PERSON	.

		Dr.
Steele	PERSON	made his mark in life as a popular instructor and successful adminis - trator , as well as the author of a series of text-books upon the merits of which opinion is still divided .

		Mrs.
Archibald	PERSON	's life is the uncritical and affec - tionate tribute of an ex-pupil to a master to whom she was personally much attached ; and it is pre - fixed by an autobiographical fragment outlining its author 's career down to about
1867	DATE	.

Steele	PERSON	's somewhat original notions as to quelling the '' old Adam '' and sowing the seeds of virtue and knowledge in the youthful mind . ''

		1900 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 133 present volume is divided into three chapters re - spectively headed , `` On the Sources of Jewish Ethics , '' '' The Principle of Jewish Ethics , '' '' The Character of Jewish Ethics . ''

		Dr.
Lazarus	PERSON	's treat - ment of his theme is strictly objective and scientific , and his work bids fair to supply when completed , through its portrayal of the inner life of Judaism , a needed supplement to the monumental History of
Graetz	PERSON	.

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		The source extracts from American history , prepared by Professor
Howard W. Caldwell	PERSON	, of
the University of Nebraska	ORGANIZATION	, and published by Mr.
J. H. Miller	PERSON	, have frequently received our commendation , and we are now glad to have the entire collection bound up in a single volume .

		The volume includes two series of ten num - bers each , their respective subjects being '' A Survey of American History '' and ''
American Territorial Devel	ORGANIZATION	- opment . ''

		The latter series comes down to the present year , and includes extracts from
State	ORGANIZATION	papers and other sources bearing upon the inglorious war of subjugation in which the country of
Washington	LOCATION	and
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	is now engaged .

		To most English readers ,
Joseph Glanvill	PERSON	is nothing more than a name , the name of an obscure English writer of the seventeenth century , from whom
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	got the story of '' The Scholar Gypsy . ''

		Those who wish to make his further acquaintance may now be directed to a monograph prepared by Dr.
Ferris Greenslet	PERSON	in pursuance of his study for a degree at
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	.

		This monograph , published for
the University	ORGANIZATION	by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is the first number in a new series of '' Studies in English . ''

		We can not commend too highly the practice of this
University	ORGANIZATION	in publishing these dissertations in the form of ordinary books .

		The present volume is thoroughly creditable to the department whence it issues , and a valuable contri - bution to the history of English literature .

		A moderate sized volume of '' Selected Writings of
Isaac M. Wise	PERSON	, '' prefixed by a hundred pages of biog - raphy , the joint work of
David Philipson	PERSON	and
Louis Grossman	PERSON	, is published under the auspices of the Alum - na !

		Association of the
Hebrew Union College	ORGANIZATION	, by the
Robert Clarke Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dr. Wise was for over half a cen - tury a conspicuous figure in American Jewish life , and the writings selected for the present volume may be pronounced as representative of their author 's style and opinions , as they are thoughtful , public-spirited , and earnest .

		There are half a dozen illustrations which acceptably crown this worthy memorial volume .

		Two new volumes in the '' Famous Scots Series '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- are Mr.
Edward Pennington	PERSON	's '' Sir
David Wilkie	PERSON	'' and Mr.
A. R. MacE	PERSON	wen 's `` The Erskines . ''

		The particular
Erskines	ORGANIZATION	treated of by Mr.
MacEwen	PERSON	were the brothers
Ebenezer	ORGANIZATION	and
Ralph	PERSON	, famous in the annals of the Scotch church in the eighteenth century .

		The early history of the Secession church , of which
Ebenezer Erskine	PERSON	was the founder , may be read in out - line in Mr.
MacEwen	PERSON	's scholarly little book .

		The life of
Wilkie	PERSON	forms an interesting story in itself , as well as an important chapter in the history of British art ; and Mr.
Penniugton	PERSON	tells it well and with due discrimina - tion , quoting the critics pro and con , and holding the balance pretty fairly between them .

		Rome : Its Rise and Fall , '' by Dr.
Philip Van Ness Myers	PERSON	-LRB- Ginn -RRB- , is an expansion of the author 's smaller text-book of Roman history into a volume of over five hundred pages , with many maps and other illustrations .

		The success long since achieved by Dr.
Myers	PERSON	as a writer of text-books guarantees the scholarship and the practical usefulness of this new work .

		It is announced that the reorganization of the affairs of
Messrs. D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	is practically completed , that all their obligations have been or shortly will be met in full , and that their business will go on with the old management and on an efficient financial basis .

		This announcement will be gratifying to the friends of this old and honorable house , and to the American book trade generally .

		The '' International Catalogue of Scientific Litera - ture '' is now well under way , and publication will be - gin next year .

		Seventeen subjects will be comprised , and a volume for each subject will be ready some time during the year .

		The price of subscription is 17 , and the
Smithsonian	ORGANIZATION	Institution will receive applications from this country .

		Three hundred sets must be sjub - scribed for in order to secure the production of this work , and the forty-five sets allotted to the
United States	LOCATION	should be taken up without delay .

		Mr.
J. R. Tutin	PERSON	's `` Concordance '' to
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's translation of Omar , published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	, seems to us to be the very acme of useless labor .

		A
Concordance	ORGANIZATION	is a work which helps us to find a striking word or phrase in a voluminous writer , and we often find such a work useful ; but we can not conceive of the existence of persons who will wish to know exactly how many times , and in what places ,
FitzGerald	PERSON	used such words as '' and '' and '' the '' in the several editions of his slender sheaf of quatrains .

		BOOKS OF THE COMING YEAR .

		Our annual autumn list of the publications announced for the coming season is this year even longer than ever before , although last year set a standard that seemed unlikely to be exceeded for some time , and although the excitement attendant upon the political orgy in which our country quadrennially indulges might reasonably seem to exercise a modifying influence upon the plans of the publishers .

		But in spite of the record of other years , and in spite of the distractions of a Presidential campaign , it seems that we are to have more books this year than ever before , and we may add that the proportion of promising announce - ments , of books that are to be awaited with eagerness , is quite as large as it has been at the opening of any past season .

		It is the purpose of the present article to indicate a few a very few only of the works that are likely to prove most attractive to readers and collectors in general .

		If there is such a thing as '' the book of the year '' in the present list , it is probably the two - volume biography of
Thomas Henry Huxley	PERSON	, that has been prepared by Mr.
Leonard Huxley	PERSON	, his son .

		Huxley was so much more than a mere man of science , he was a philoso - pher and humanist in so large a sense , that the story of his life is likely to be found equal in interest to that of any of his great Victorian contemporaries .

		Those who are familiar with his miscellaneous writings know that he touched nothing that he did not adorn with his humor , his argumentative appeal , his apt allusiveness , and his heightened sense for good literature as well as for sound logic .

		The story of such a life can not fail , when told at length , to prove both instructive and fascinating .

		Standing at the head of the biographies of the year , this work , however , will by no means stand alone .

		It will be accompanied by important biogra - phies of
Coventry Patmore	ORGANIZATION	,
James Martineau	PERSON	, and
Francis Parkman	PERSON	, by the intensely inter - esting autobiography of Mr.
Stillman	PERSON	-LRB- `` which recent readers of the `` Atlantic '' have followed with so much interest -RRB- , and by such works of the pictorial type as Mr.
Mabie	PERSON	's Shakespeare , and the two treatments of Cromwell by Mr.
Theodore Roosevelt	PERSON	and Mr.
John Morley	PERSON	.

		The latter work will be welcome indeed , for it is far too long since a new book by Mr.
Mor	PERSON	- ley has made its appearance , and we are glad to know that his hand has not lost its cunning during these years of preoccupation with the problems of practical politics .

		We may also , perhaps , mention under the present heading the forthcoming book by Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, entitled '' Literary Friends and Acquaintances , '' which will be both biography and autobiography , 168 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, both in a fragmentary but genial way .

		Frag - mentary and genial also , doubtless , will be the volume of Major Pond 's reminiscences of the famous men and women of the platform and stage whom he has known in his long career as manager , which will be published under the title '' Eccentricities of Genius . ''

		There will be interest in the forthcoming life of
Henry George	PERSON	, by his son ; and in the comple - tion , in two additional volumes , of the late
Augustus J. C. Hare	PERSON	's '' Story of My Life , '' the first two volumes of which were issued several years ago .

		First in importance in the field of general literature is the long-expected '' American Anthology '' of Mr.
E. C. Stedman	PERSON	, which , many times delayed and eagerly awaited , is now definitely promised for this season .

		Next in interest to the student of American liter - ature will be the ambitious `` Literary History of
America	LOCATION	, '' upon which Prof.
Barrett Wen	PERSON	- dell has been long engaged .

		The season is to give us some additional letters of
Edward FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	, edited by Mr.
Aldis Wright	PERSON	; and also a new life of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	by Mr.
John Glyde	PERSON	.

		Mention of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	reminds us that we are to have a volume on '' The Life and Times of
Omar Khayyam	PERSON	, '' written by Mr.
Denison Ross	PERSON	.

		Other items of interest in this category are a new volume of essays by
Count Tolstoi	LOCATION	, a study of the Sonnets of Shakespeare by Mr.
Parke Godwin	PERSON	, a study of Milton by Mr.
Walter Raleigh	PERSON	, and an au - thorized English translation of
M. Rostand	PERSON	's `` L'Aiglon . ''

		A noticeable feature of the season 's announcements is the unusually large number of new and attractive editions of stan - dard works , of which space will allow us to mention only the edition de luxe of the works of
Walter Pater	PERSON	, in eight sumptuous volumes ; the novels of
Charles Kingsley	PERSON	, edited and supplied with introductions by his son , Mr.
Maurice Kingsley	PERSON	; the `` Knickerbocker '' edi - tion of Lord Macaulay , in 20 volumes ; a com - plete edition of
George Borrow	ORGANIZATION	's works , edited by Professor
Knapp	PERSON	and others ; and a popular seven-volume edition of the writings of Col.
T. W. Higginson	PERSON	.

		Among works of scholarship , the first place must be given to the ''
General History of Modern Times	ORGANIZATION	, '' which has long been prepar - ing under the editorship of Lord
Acton	PERSON	.

		This great enterprise , which has enlisted the most eminent scholars in its preparation , will extend to twelve volumes , the first of which , '' The Renaissance , '' is now announced as ready for publication .

		Another highly important co - operative enterprise is the '' World '' series of descriptive geographies , edited by Mr.
J. H. Mackinder	PERSON	, of which the first two volumes will appear at once .

		Still another large col - lective undertaking is the '' Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology , '' in three volumes , edited by Professor
James Mark Baldwin	PERSON	, which is now nearly ready to see the light .

		A few more titles of important works , taken somewhat at random , are '' Studies in History and Jurisprudence , '' by Mr.
James Bryce	PERSON	; `` Introduction to English Politics , '' by Mr.
John W. Robertson	PERSON	; '' A Century of Amer - ican Diplomacy , '' by Mr.
John W. Foster	PERSON	, our foremost living diplomatist ; '' Italian Cities , '' by Mr. and Mrs.
E. H. Blashfield	PERSON	; '' The Ascent of
Mount St. Elias	LOCATION	, '' by the Duke of
Abruzzi	LOCATION	; ''
Pompeii	LOCATION	, '' by
M. Pierre Gusman	PERSON	; '' Through the
First Antarctic Night	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Dr.
Frederick A. Cook	PERSON	; '' The Harriman Expedition to
Alaska	LOCATION	'' ; and '' The Problem of
Asia	LOCATION	, '' by Captain
A. T. Mahan	PERSON	.

		There are to be no end of books about
China	LOCATION	and the new Eastern question , but none of them will be likely to equal in weight and influence this work of Captain
Mahan	PERSON	.

		Interest in
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	affairs has of course eclipsed for the moment events in
South Africa	LOCATION	; but we are to have a number of new volumes on the Boer war , the most important of which are
Richard Harding Davis	PERSON	's '' With Both Armies in
South Africa	LOCATION	, '' Dr.
A. Conan Doyle	PERSON	's '' History of the South African War , '' and Mr.
Winston Spencer Churchill	PERSON	's account of ''
Ian Hamilton	PERSON	's
March	DATE	. ''

		Among the more sumptuous art publications we find two elaborate volumes devoted to the work of
Van Dyck	ORGANIZATION	, one by Mr.
Lionel Gust	PERSON	, the other unsponsored ; an account of ''
Bot	ORGANIZATION	- ticelli and his School , '' by Count
Plunkett	PERSON	; a life of Sir
Joshua Reynolds	PERSON	, by Sir
Walter Armstrong	PERSON	; and a '' Life of Lord
Leighton	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
Ernest Rhys	PERSON	.

		These promise to be works of permanent value , although clad in holiday raiment ; of holiday books in the stricter sense , so many are announced that we give up in despair the attempt to make any selection at all .

		Our list is fairly swamped with works of fiction , and the task of selecting a few of the many titles offered is peculiarly invidious .

		The following have caught our attention as among those most deserving of mention : '' The Lane That Had No Turning , '' by Mr.
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	; '' The Palace of the King , ''
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 169 by Mr.
F. Marion Crawford	PERSON	; ''
Richard Yea	PERSON	and Nay , '' by Mr.
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	; '' The Hosts of the Lord , '' by Mrs.
F. A. Steel	PERSON	; ''
Tommy	PERSON	and Grizel , '' by Mr.
James M. Barrie	PERSON	; '' Some Women I Have Known , '' by ''
Maarten Maartens	PERSON	'' ; `` Dr. North and his Friends , '' by Dr.
S. Weir Mitchell	PERSON	; '' The Last Refuge , '' by Mr.
Henry B. Fuller	PERSON	; '' Quisante , '' by Mr.
Anthony Hope	PERSON	; ''
Robert Orange	PERSON	, '' by ``
John Oliver Hobbes	PERSON	'' ; `` The Fourth Generation , '' by Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	; '' The Isle of Unrest , '' by Mr.
Henry Seton Merriman	PERSON	; '' Nude Souls , '' by '' Benjamin Swift '' ; `` The Mantle of
Elijah	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
Israel Zangwill	PERSON	; '' and ''
Eleanor	PERSON	, '' by Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	.

		The announcements in poetry , although not unnumerous , are of such very minor importance that it seems hardly worth while to specify any of them .

		We look in vain for the volume by Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	which some recent notes in the English jour - nals had led us to expect this
fall	DATE	.

		THE MENTAL PROCESSES OF ANIMALS .

		In a Monograph Supplement to '' The Psycho - logical Review , '' Volume II. , No. 4 , Dr.
Edward L. Thorndyke	PERSON	presents a series of experiments on the mental processes of animals , and his conclusions based thereon .

		So profoundly convinced is he of the finality of these conclusions , as well as of the uselessness of any but experimental studies , that he does not hesitate to declare himself as follows : '' Surely everyone must agree that no man now has a right to advance theories about what is in animals ' minds or to deny previous theories unless he supports his thesis by sys - tematic and extended experiments . ''

		He is , moreover , particularly severe on those be - lated persons who think that the lower animals i. e. , those below man reason .

		After admitting that both such men and their opponents have thus far based their belief on mere opinions , he says : '' So , although it is in a way superfluous to give the coup de grace to the despised theory that animals reason , I think it worth while to settle this question once for all . ''

		In the quotations given above , it will be observed that Dr.
Thorndyke	PERSON	first denies the right of any one not of the experimental school , even though a naturalist who has devoted many years to the study of animals in their normal surroundings , to enter into the discussion at all after the advent of his -LRB- Dr.
Thorndyke	PERSON	's -RRB- work ; and then all parties are notified that the coup de grace has been given to '' the despised reason theory . ''

		Against both of these positions I desire to enter a protest .

		I must at the outset , however , confess to a sincere admiration for the ingenuity and care exhibited by Dr.
Thorndyke	PERSON	in the devising of ex - periments and for his patience in carrying them out and tabulating the results .

		Although the pur - pose of this article renders it necessary to criticise , to some extent , these experiments , it should be un - derstood that such criticisms are not inconsistent with a sincere appreciation of the many admirable features that could easily be pointed out .

		The gen - eral method of experimentation was as follows : '' It was merely to put animals when hungry in enclosures from which they could escape by some simple act , such as pulling at a loop of cord , pressing a lever , or stepping on a platform .

		The animal was put in the enclosure , food was left outside in sight , and his actions observed . ''

		The author further explains that '' so far as possible the animals were kept in a state of hunger , which was practically utter hunger . ''

		It might be suggested that imprisonment in a box while suffering from the pangs of utter hunger is not likely to result in the best mental conditions for the exhibition of normal mental activities , and that conclusions drawn from the conduct of such animals might justly be relegated to the limbo of '' Abnormal Psychology . ''

		Can we wonder that under these conditions '' there was displayed no ob - servations of the surroundings or deliberations upon them ? ''

		The author remarks that `` the cat does not look over the situation , much less think over it . ''

		This conclusion appears to be entirely gratui - tous , and it seems not unlikely that the unfortunate animal would be doing a deal of thinking which might take some such form as this : '' This is most unpleasant , and I will try every means in my power to get out at once . ''

		And then it would do exactly what Dr.
Thorndyke	PERSON	says it does when he reports that it '' bursts out at once into the activities which instinct and experience have settled on as suitable reactions to the situation . ''

		I imagine that a boy similarly treated would act in a similar manner , and not necessarily without reason .

		It may fairly be maintained , I think , that these experiments are negative in their results , so far as proof of reason is concerned .

		They neither prove reason nor the absence of reason .

		Similar experi - ments with human beings , even though attended by similar conduct , would not prove the absence of the power to reason .

		The boy above referred to might be able to solve an equation when not mentally per - turbed by imprisonment or fear , and physically deranged by utter hunger .

		Those who believe that the higher mammals reason have , it seems to me , a perfectly logical ground for that belief .

		Nothing beyond an outline of the argument can be given here , but even this , it is hoped , will show that the coup de grace has still to be given to the despised '' reason '' theory .

		It is almost an axiom among biologists that closely similar organs in animals that are zoologi - cally closely related , as are all of the higher mam - malia , are similar in function , and that the greater the similarity in structure the greater the similarity in function .

		Taken in general , the organs in the 170 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, cat , for instance , are so similar to corresponding structures in man that their activities are not only inferred but known to be similar in kind , although perhaps differing greatly in degree .

		Not only is this true , but also the highly significant fact that similar stimuli result in similar reaction , showing not only structural but physiological likeness be - tween the nervous systems of the two .

		Drugs and medicines , in general , have the same effect on both , in witness whereof stands practically the whole mass of facts accumulated by the experimental phy - siologists .

		Now this similarity in kind is no less true of the brain than of other organs .

		This being a matter of prime importance to my argument , I have sought expert testimony .

		Professor
G. L. Houser	PERSON	, a specialist in brain structure and head of the
Department of Animal Morphology	ORGANIZATION	in the
State University of Iowa	ORGANIZATION	, has the following to say concerning the fundamental similarity between the brain of man and of the order
Carnivora	ORGANIZATION	, to which the mammals experi - mented upon by Dr.
Thorndyke	PERSON	belong : `` The brain of the higher
Carnivora	ORGANIZATION	may be compared with the human brain without disclosing any essential differ - ence either in external characters or in internal structure . ''

		Recently the claim has been made that an import - ant difference between the brain of man and other animals is found in the '' association tracts , '' which are supposed to have to do with the transmission of impulses between different parts of the brain .

		At my request , Dr.
Henry H. Donaldson	PERSON	, head of the
Department of Neurology	ORGANIZATION	in the
University of Chi	ORGANIZATION	- cago , permits me to quote him as follows : '' In the cerebrum of vertebrates , so far as the cortex is developed , there appear to be always present cells which we can fairly assume to be concerned in passing nerve impulses from one part of the cortex to another .

		This is physiologi - cally the process of association .

		It doubtless is very poorly developed in the lower orders , but it is essentially the same arrangement as is found in the cortex of man himself ... '' `` The possibility of this physiological linking of different portions of the cortex is not to be confused with the presence or absence of so-called association fibres , which are defined in anatomical terms only . ''

		In regard to these association fibres , there is no question , I believe , about their being found in all the higher
Mammalia	LOCATION	.

		It is admitted that the brain is the physical organ , the activities or functions of which are in - volved in mental phenomena .

		We are therefore justified in taking the position that these similar organs have similar functions in the man and in the cat .

		In other words , their mental activities are similar , and do not differ in kind , however much they may differ in degree ; and we confidently assert that this similarity in function appears to extend to the function or power of reasoning .

		That the higher mammals appear to reason is a proposition that few naturalists would care to deny .

		Almost anyone who has had an intimate acquaint - ance with animals would agree to the statement that they exhibit activities which would unhesitat - ingly be ascribed to reason if exhibited by human beings .

		Dr.
Thorndyke	PERSON	, to be sure , denies that his animals even appeared to reason ; but his testimony is far outweighed by the repeated observations of the great majority of those naturalists who have given most attention to the mental activities of animals .

		Now there are no possible criteria whereby we can interpret the mental activities of other organ - isms than our own , save those furnished by our own mental states .

		These criteria may be wrong , but they are absolutely our only resource .

		In other words , we are forced to interpret the acts of ani - mals in terms of our own consciousness , or else not to interpret them at all .

		Ours is the only mind with which we are acquainted at first-hand , and those acts which with us are accompanied by certain mental states must be assumed to be accompanied by similar mental states in animals with similar brains , until the contrary is proved .

		The burden of proof is thus brought to rest upon those who deny to the lower animals the power to reason .

		The argument which I have thus briefly sum - marized can be outlined as follows : Dr.
Thorndyke	PERSON	's experiments were by their nature such as to interfere with the normal mental activities of his subjects , and even if they were valid his results were negative , so far as reason is concerned .

		The demonstrated similarity between the anat - omy and physiology of man and the higher mam - mals , extending as it does to the brain and its minute structure , gives us a logical right to expect mental activities similar in kind , however great the difference in degree .

		This similarity in brain structure is actually accompanied by activities that , in us , would be at once regarded as the outcome of reason .

		It is therefore logical to assume that reason is an attribute of at least some minds of animals lower than man .

		Furthermore , this assumption holds good until proof to the contrary is forthcom - ing , and it is from the nature of the case almost impossible to prove such a negative so long as any animals even appear to reason .

		It will be seen that I have not as yet attempted to define reason .

		For the purposes of this discus - sion I am willing to accept Dr.
Thorndyke	PERSON	's defini - tion which is implied in the question : '' Do they -LSB- animals -RSB- ever conclude from inference that a certain act will produce a desired result , and so do it ? ''

		I am willing to assert that they appear to do so , and that is all that anyone is warranted in asserting either of the lower animals or of any human being save himself .

		It may be noted , in conclusion , that many modern psychologists would not agree with Dr.
Thorndyke	PERSON	in this matter .

		Dr.
G. T. W. Patrick	PERSON	, Professor of Psychology in the
State University of Iowa	ORGANIZATION	, allows me to quote him as follows : `` The trend of opinion among modern psychologists is toward the belief that the mental activities of man do not differ in kind from those of the higher mammalia in general . '

		THE DIAL 171 MONT BLANC MOUNTAINEERING .

		* Mr.
Mathews	PERSON	's handsome volume entitled '' The Annals of Mont Blanc '' is in no sense a record of personal experiences , although the author has climbed the great mountain twelve times , and could hence unfold an interesting tale of his own adventures if he chose ; nor is it an account of the geological evolution and modification of
Mont Blanc	PERSON	, although a special chapter on this subject is supplied by Professor
T. G. Bonney	PERSON	.

		The book may be fairly de - scribed as a history of Mont Blanc mountain - eering a detailed account of the various ascents and attempted ascents of the mountain , from the early essays , in
1762	DATE	,
1775	DATE	, and
1783	DATE	, of
Pierre Simond	PERSON	and others , and the pioneering ascents of
Balmat	LOCATION	,
Paccard	LOCATION	, and Saussure -LRB- 1786 ,
1787	DATE	-RRB- , down to the time of
Albert Smith	PERSON	-LRB- 1851 -RRB- , when climbing
Mont Blanc	PERSON	began to be regarded , not as a feat al - most comparable with a voyage to the Pole , but as a customary part of the programme of more adventurous Alpine tourists .

		Mr.
Mathews	PERSON	's book is the first of its kind and scope in English ,
Albert Smith	PERSON	's brochure of fifty years ago being mainly the story of his own exploit , while Mr.
Whymper	PERSON	's excellent '' Guide to
Chamonix	LOCATION	and Mont Blanc '' is a guide-book rather than a history .

		In reading the interesting accounts of the earlier ascents of
Mont Blanc	PERSON	, one is struck not only with the sufferings which the adven - turous , and , as it then seemed , foolhardy pioneers actually endured , but with their very vivid , and as we should now think , exagger - ated sense of the dangers of their undertaking .

		Perhaps a remnant of the mysterious and legendary terrors with which the imagination of certain old writers , such as
John Jacob Scheuchzer	PERSON	, had invested the mountain , still lingered about it in the days of Balmat and Saussure , and to the known material dangers of avalanches and crevasses added the grisly possibility of an encounter with the grim shapes and '' beckoning shadows dire '' still popularly believed to haunt those icy fast - nesses .

		Scheuchzer is learned in the habits of the chamois , which he calls '' rupi - capra , '' noting among other things how the sagacious beast is given to '' licking certain porous rocks in order to promote digestion . ''

		But it is as the discoverer of Swiss dragons that this Professor of Mathematics especially shines in the department of

		But he establishes the fact of their existence to his own entire satisfaction through the testimony of '' unimpeachable witnesses , '' and gives some instructive facts as to their habits , haunts , etc. , together with many draw - ings of the monsters , as they were described to him by veracious informants .

		One of these pictures , reproduced by our author , shows a dragon in an alarming state of rampancy , and bearing a general family resemblance to his English relative of
Wantley	LOCATION	, as the cuts at the top of the old ballad figured him .

		Perhaps mountaineering pioneers of the days of Balmat and Saussure did not exactly ex - pect to be drawn into a magnetic lake if they ventured to scale unexplored heights of
Mont Blanc	PERSON	, still less to be called upon to play the role of
Saint Michael	PERSON	with one of
Scheuchzer	ORGANIZATION	's dragons .

		But they had a somewhat gruesome antecedent notion of the terrors and perils of the mountain , and they were by no means in - clined to make light of the dangers and suffer - ings they had endured after making their first ascents .

		All of them complained bitterly of frost-bites , of snow - blindness , of blistered faces , of agonies resulting from breathing the rarified air ; and some of them were urgent in their advice that no one should follow their example .

		Sherwill , for instance , said : '' It is in itself a dangerous effort .

		The risk of losing one 's own life or that of the guides is too great to be in - 172 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, curred without a very important object . ''

		Sir
Charles Fellows	PERSON	, who made the ascent in
1827	DATE	, was still more emphatic . ''

		Great as is the pleasure of overcoming an acknowl - edged succession of dangers , any one who sets the least value upon his own life , or upon theirs who must ac - company him on such an expedition , hazards a risk which upon calm consideration he ought not to venture ; and if it ever falls to my lot to dissuade a friend from attempting what we have gone through , I shall consider that I have saved his life . ''

		Various were the motives that impelled men to climb
Mont Blanc	PERSON	, in the days when the feat was a rare one and shed a certain glory upon those who performed it .

		Some attempted the ascent through pure love of adventure and the promptings of restless curiosity ; others for the sake of the positive information which the expedition might afford ; not a few , we fear , through motives akin to those which inspire the perennial '' crank '' who jumps off
Brooklyn	LOCATION	Bridge , '' shoots '' the rapids at Niagara in a barrel , or crosses the
Atlantic	LOCATION	in a yawl , or fires a pistol at somebody whose murder is sure to make a great stir in the world .

		But there is no great fame , or notoriety , to be gained nowadays through scaling
Mont Blanc	PERSON	, since everybody has done it . ''

		Familiarity has bred for it , not indeed contempt , but at least indifference .

		Men have climbed it without guides ; women have climbed it ; blind men have climbed it ; a priest has said Mass -LSB- shade of the Savoyard Vicar ! -RSB-

		upon its summit ; it has been scaled in the depth of winter ; Professor
Tyndall	PERSON	slept upon the top , though not without much suffering ;
M. Vallot	PERSON	spent three days and nights there .

		Many a great feat has been achieved upon it ; Mr.
Frederick Morshead	PERSON	once climbed it alone , and went up and down in less than seventeen hours . ''

		All of which may be said without detracting from the fame of the gallant spirits who , im - pelled by the thirst for adventure and the ambition of adding to the sum of human knowl - edge , first made their way , by unknown paths and through unknown dangers , to the summit of the
King of Swiss Mountains	ORGANIZATION	.

		The adven - tures of these pioneers are agreeably told by Mr.
Mathews	PERSON	the story of
Balmat	PERSON	's ascent being borrowed from
Dumas	PERSON	-LRB- '' Impressions de Voyage Suisse '' -RRB- , who took it from the lips of Balmat himself .

		The work forms a suffi - ciently full and very entertaining account of Mont Blanc mountaineering .

		There are special chapters entitled '' The Formation of the Al - pine Club , '' `` Fatalities , '' `` The Chamonix Guides , '' '' The Bibliography of Mont Blanc . ''

		An Appendix contains a '' Table of Ascents from
1786	DATE	to
1851	DATE	, '' a '' Table of Fatalities , '' a '' Letter from
Jacques Balmat	PERSON	, '' etc. , and there is a map of the routes up
Mont Blanc	PERSON	.

		Though posthumous , they are no pitiful remnants swept up for the market , but a com - plete , rounded , and standard work , a sound staff for historical students so long as there shall be any , and withal eminently readable to the thoughtful layman .

		The price of this per - fectedness does not appear upon its face , nor even in the summary of enormous labor the book required ; for the last payment was made as it were in blood .

		It is to be noted that Dr.

Moqui	PERSON	,
Navajo	ORGANIZATION	,
Mojave	ORGANIZATION	, etc. , after the historic spelling .

		Decidedly second to
Bandelier	ORGANIZATION	in critical knowledge of the documents , Dr.
Coues	PERSON	was easily foremost of our documentary editors .

		He revived the dignity of the bedraggled term '' popular science , '' so largely used for matter which is neither scientific nor popular .

		Dr.
Coues	PERSON	's work was both .

		His broad and inde - fatigable scholarship was formulated in a me - dium peculiarly sympathetic and '' taking . ''

		Manful , aggressive , generous , pungent , afraid of nothing on earth save error , he captivated many who intrinsically cared nothing for his themes .

		One of the best equipped and most vital reviewers in this country , on all topics of Western history this side of
1800	DATE	, he was also one of the most competent workers therein , and beyond reasonable competition our foremost popularizing editor of '' sources . ''

		A theme after his own heart was this import - ant Didrio of Fray
Francisco Garces	PERSON	, a typical Franciscan missionary who , like hundreds of his kind , before and after , plodded by the hundred leagues over the burning wastes of
New Mexico	LOCATION	,
Arizona	LOCATION	, and the general South - west ; penetrated savage tribes , dwelt among them , converted them , chronicled them , and by them were at last given the crown of martyr - dom .

		For centuries it was almost the regula - tion programme of the Great American Desert an educated evangelist , alone amid his bar - barous flock , farther from a population of his countrymen than the
Klondiker	PERSON	gets to-d ay ; per - suading brush-housed savages to build to the new God they so little laid hold upon so huge and noble temples in wilderness and squalid ranch - eria as we can match only in our greatest cities -LRB- if at all -RRB- ; making their tongue a universal password through nearly a thousand diverse lan - guages and along more than five thousand miles north-and-south ; and at last , in some brute - childish impatience of their parishioners , hacked or clubbed to death for their pains .


Garces	PERSON	was for thirteen years a frontier apostle to our
Southwestern Indians	ORGANIZATION	.

		He came from
Spain	LOCATION	, young in years and in the vows of St.
Francis	PERSON	; and in
1768	DATE	-LRB- being then thirty years old -RRB- was resident priest at the frontier mission of
San Xavier	LOCATION	del Bac , near our mod - ern
Tucson	LOCATION	in
Arizona	LOCATION	.

		The church , set in a huddle of
Papago	LOCATION	hovels , is famous as the most notable and most noble example of old ecclesi - astical architecture north of
Mexico	LOCATION	.

		Up to
1781	DATE	-LRB- when he was cruelly slain by his flock in the brutal massacre of
July 1719	DATE	at the
Puerto de ` la Purisima Concepcion	ORGANIZATION	, where
Yuma	LOCATION	now stands -RRB-
Garces	PERSON	had made five evangelizing explorations through the South - western deserts ; covering over 1800 leagues on foot , visiting some 25,000 savage Indians of dozens of tribes , penetrating the unmapped wilderness as far as the mouth of the
Colorado	LOCATION	; the
Tulare valley	LOCATION	, halfway up
California	LOCATION	, and back across to the remote Moqui villages .

		He was the first white man to cover and record a very considerable portion of this enormous itinerary .

		In footsore mileage he was sur - passed by a few , equaled by many , of his fel - low-missionaries ; but none of our '' American '' explorers have matched his record .

		He ac - companied that competent frontiersman and Apache-fighter ,
Juan Bautista Anza	PERSON	, on the longest and worst part of the expedition which founded
San Francisco	LOCATION	, the present metropolis of the
Pacific Coast	LOCATION	; and left it only to make a far longer , far harder , and far more perilous journey alone to the cliff-built pueblos of Tusayau .

		He kept of all his wanderings a modest , matter-of-fact diary , unburdened with any record of his physical sufferings on a route the best equipped wagon-party even now could not duplicate without severe hardships .

		His chronicle is devoted to the topographies and peoples he found ; the tribal names , numbers , relationships , customs , and disposition to the Faith ; and it is of intimate importance to our knowledge of Southwestern ethnography .

		Like nearly all the numerous like documents of the pioneer missionaries and explorers , it has been hitherto inaccessible except to the adept ; never translated , and even in Spanish available only in the inaccurate version printed in
Mexico	LOCATION	in
1854	DATE	and long since out of print .

		Historically precious , it was worth publicity even as a hu - man document .

		An incomplete measure of what
Garces	PERSON	endured is suggested by the fact that the untimely death of his editor -LRB- himself a veteran army-surgeon of the frontier -RRB- was directly due to a journey in a Studebaker wagon , with mess , shelter , and all the ameli - orations of loving companionship , money , and a close-at-hand railroad , over something like one-twentieth of the Southwestern distances 174 THE DIAL , -LSB-

		The text of this old-fashioned traveller 's diary is carefully '' compared '' with the three known versions , and annotated exhaustively .

		Of the more than 600 pages in these volumes , over half are occupied by the illuminative commentary .

		The 52-page index is perhaps the least complete member of the work .

		It omits the
Rudo Ensayo	PERSON	, the Apostolicos Afanes ,
Acoma	LOCATION	, the
Cronica Serafica	LOCATION	, and other vital references .

		The translation , as a whole , is scrupulously exact , though with some serious flaws .

		The marvel is , to those who know the field and knew Dr.
Coues	PERSON	in it , that these flaws are so few .

		His acquaintance with Spanish was by no means intimate .

		Except for his natural and trained gift as a lexicographer , and his insatiable conscientiousness , the translation of this rather esoteric '' source '' must have been a monumental failure ; with them , it is an as - tonishing success .

		Barring a few errors which are not vital to the historic value of the record , it is admirable throughout .

		The astounding misconception -LRB- p. xxii . -RRB-

		of the virtue of Spanish accents ; a good many renderings too loose , and as many too '' tight '' but none essential in broad understanding of the text indicate how much this translation must have cost its author .

		There is a certain tang in retaining the Spanish words which have be - come -LRB- over a million square miles , at least -RRB- part of our vernacular like '' mesa , '' '' canon , '' '' arroyo , '' '' pueblo , '' and the like .

		To trans - late them nowadays would be absurd and con - fusing .

		But there is no reason why ''
Espan	PERSON	- oles '' is better than `` Spaniards , '' or '' aguage '' than '' water-hole , '' or '' parage '' than '' stop - ping-place '' and printed without even an italic to show that it is par-dh-kc , and not some orphaned relative of '' disparage . '' ''

		Canal de
Santa Barbara	LOCATION	'' is particularly needless and misleading for ''
Santa Barbara Channel	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		for las jornadas acostumbradas means not '' by the usual route '' but '' by the accustomed stages '' -LRB- Jornada , day 's journey -RRB- .

		Estamos buenos can no more mean '' we are good '' than it could mean `` we have indigestion . ''

		It is the cast-iron Spanish for '' we are well . ''

		The fanciful misapprehension of la gente -LRB- p. 230 -RRB- is barely short of absurd ; and a very few other equal blunders are to be noted ; yet after a punctual reading I can not recall another document of our Spanish-Americana on the whole so soundly translated .

		As for the connotation , it is Coues at his best .

		Barring a few needless and not really critical flings at
Garces	PERSON	's creed , it is as masterly as readable .

		Amid the voluminous notes , per - haps the most broadly interesting are those which -LRB- in gentle humor , but strict justice -RRB- bring to book General
Simpson	PERSON	's truly astounding blunders of '' facsimile '' and translation of the historic epigraphs of '' Inscription Rock '' in
Western New Mexico	LOCATION	.

		There is perhaps , in all our scientific annals , no deadlier example of the perils of guess-work .

		For more than forty years General
Simpson	PERSON	was easily first among '' American '' students of the South - west , and his major premises will endure ; but his El Morro experience warns us to take an expert 's word only in so far as he is expert , and not in his hearsay conclusions .

		DEMOCRACY AND EMPIRE .

		* A timely contribution to the current dis - cussion of the probabilities as to the outcome of the American experiment in democratic government , and the dangers supposed to lurk in what is called '' Imperialism '' as applied to American policies , is furnished by Dr.
F. H. Giddings	PERSON	, Professor of Sociology in
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	.

		Grouping together a number of addresses and papers prepared by him during recent years , he has published them in a vol - ume under the title of '' Democracy and Em - pire . ''

		The series is devoted mainly to scientific explanations of the workings of democracy in various directions , the point of view being that of the student of sociology .

		There is but a minimum of the book devoted to a discussion of '' Empire , '' only three of the twenty essays being apparently inspired by the recent Amer - ican problems concerning Expansion .

		But the entire collection of essays is pertinent to these problems , for it is the office of the whole to instruct the reader concerning the normal op - erations of democratic government in general , and of the American experiment in particular .

		The author 's treatment of his subject is syn - thetic rather than analytic , as is natural in the case of a collection of papers prepared at different dates and for various purposes .

		Those who wish to analyze them will find him treat - ing of three distinct phases of the general sub - ject , namely : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Democracy subjective , its DEMOCRACY AND EMPIKK .

United States	LOCATION	.

		The mode of treatment throughout is scientific .

		The es - sayist searches for and elucidates the facts of his case ; and to these , all questions of senti - ment are fearlessly subordinated .

		It frequently follows that fine-spun political theories are seen to be devoid of substantial basis .

		Democracy being simply a society organized for purposes of government ,
Professor Giddings	ORGANIZATION	applies to its operations the same principles that he has found governing the movements of societies in general .

		The data furnished by
Sociology	ORGANIZATION	ought to furnish a guide for the study of democratic government .

		As men habitually act in all ordinary associated move - ments , they may be expected to act when asso - ciating together politically .

		Sociology teaches that the element which primarily distinguishes humanity in society , and enables it to become homogeneous , to act as one , and to accomplish joint ends and purposes , is like-mindedness , or mental homogeneity .

		This thought recurs fre - quently in Professor
Giddings	ORGANIZATION	's essays .


Politi	PERSON	- cal societies , like all others , crystallize around a common sentiment or aggregation of opinions . ''

		On no other basis can a political system rest , '' says our essayist . ''

		There must be unanimity of feeling and opinion upon all fundamental questions of government and policy .

		All dif - ferences and contentions must be subordinate to the essential , fundamental unity of thought . ''

		A fair example of the workings of this prin - ciple is seen in the experience of the American people , in the establishment and maintenance of their unique form of democratic government .

		But '' absolute like-mindedness would be the social Nirvana , '' says Professor Giddings . ''

		What becomes , then , of progress ?

		Is that a scientific description of society which fails to give any account of variation ? ''

		This part of the problem , also , is elucidated by our essayist .

		A like-minded society may be progressive , and new feelings and thoughts and purposes may be introduced to the extent that they can be assimilated into and made part of the homo - geneity without destroying it entirely ; leaven - ing the mass without causing it to explode .

		For a near example of a historical process illus - trative of this part of his thesis , our author might have referred to the action of the fathers of the republic .

		They were at once conserva - tive and progressive .

		They were like-minded in their devotion to local self-government .

		The novel feature of a strong national government federating together thirteen States and thereby preserving and more fully developing local self - government , has now become fully assimilated ; and a larger , broader , and stronger homo - geneity is now the distinguishing feature of the American democracy .

		Such is the ordinary gradual progress by which most of the world 's great forward move - ments are characterized .

		But there is another form in which societies often move , the revo - lutionary .

		This is generally '' an impulsive , unreasoning social action , like that of the mob . ''

		All great impulsive movements in a democracy are of this character .

		In its famili - arity with them , the world has often overlooked one of their features , namely , that when dis - covered they are already in operation .

		Both mobs and revolutions begin with violent and impulsive action by the irresponsible and ex - citable elements of the people .

		Professor Giddings instances the Crusades , which began , not with organized movements headed by great commanders , but with the marchings of the impulsive rabble under
Peter	PERSON	the Hermit and
Walter	PERSON	the Penniless .

		Facts such as these , not generally observed , mean , he says , '' that , at the very outset , impulsive social action is quasi-criminal , if not altogether criminal ; it begins with the violent acts of those men who are themselves least subject to control . ''

		The only remedy for this evil is preventive and anticipatory ; it is '' to multiply in the commu - nity the number of those men who habitually subordinate feeling to reason , '' so as to pre - serve a large and controlling element who can - not be stampeded .

		Thus Professor
Giddings	PERSON	has illustrated not only the statics but the dynamics of Democ - racy .

		His searching studies of its character - istics in both respects are in forcible contrast to the superficial observations of many other essayists .

		Sir
Henry Maine	PERSON	, for instance , in his '' Popular Government '' said : '' By a wise constitution , Democracy may be made nearly as calm as water in a great artificial reservoir ; but if there is a weak point anywhere in the structure , the mighty force which it controls will burst through it and spread destruction far and near . ''

		Maine skimmed lightly over the surface of his subject ;
Giddings	ORGANIZATION	has searched its depths .

		It would be impossible in this review to ex - press the full value of these essays .

		They must be read at length to be fairly appreciated .

		The remedies for the evils to which Democracy 176 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, is seen to be prone are suggested again and again , in their application both to individuals and societies .

		The Ethical Motive , ascertained with reference to individuals , and traced in its influences , leads to and illustrates one of the positive doctrines of Sociology , namely , that the whole nature of the man should be devel - oped harmoniously , in all his social , political , and business relations .

		The law of true pro- gress in society , political or otherwise , requires a like development in each individual , avoiding all excesses of competition , rush for wealth , and shirking of honest toil , and seeking the greatest good of the greatest number .

		The Gospel of Non-Resistance , lifted out of the limitations set by
Tolstoi	ORGANIZATION	and applied in its spirit to nations and their affairs , is found to promote the habit of non-aggression , and thus gradually to lead to the time when non-resist - ance will become unnecessary .

		The essayist seems to rise to the height of his great argu - ment in the chapter on '' The Ideals of Na - tions , '' which is a comprehensive summary of the '' Philosophy of Universal History . ''

		It scarcely need be suggested that Professor Giddings is an optimist , and in the '' expan - sion '' which distinguishes our recent national operations he sees merely the working of a force within the nation , operating , as it were , automatically , and therefore to be diagnosed as normal rather than abnormal .

		If this na - tional disposition is to be called `` imperialism '' -LRB- which term our essayist discusses with an in - terrogation point '' ? '' -RRB-

		, it is still but a national trait , to be recognized , not antagonized .

		The truth , he says , is simply this : '' The American population of seventy million or more souls is at this moment the most stupendous reservoir of seething energy to be found on any conti - nent . ''

		This energy can not be confined ; it must have its outlet ; it may be directed and managed ; how worse than useless to restrict or control it !

		If it does indeed demand the earth as its field , this does not merit despair .

		Let it be called '' Imperialism '' if it does not cease to be Democratic .

		The minute studies made into the statics and dynamics of American de - mocracy do not forbid the hope or the expec - tation that it may with equal success be more largely expanded , with the result of a '' Demo - cratic Empire . ''

		In this sense ,
Professor Giddings	ORGANIZATION	betrays no fear of the operations of '' Democratic Imperialism . ''

		It may be that Democracy can eliminate from the Imperialism of the old form everything except the vastness of its domain .

		Then we shall witness '' The Democratic Empire '' of which our essayist writes in his first chapter .

		He emulates the familiarity with which the Fathers of the Re - public , at the very time of founding our
Fed	ORGANIZATION	- eral system of government , spoke of it as an Empire in futuro ; witness the typical demo - crat
James Madison	PERSON	, who at the outset of his contributions to '' The Federalist , '' saw , in his mind 's eye , '' one great , respectable , and flour - ishing empire . ''

		STUDIES IN TAXATION AND GOVERNMENT .

		* Taxation , according to the late
David A. Wells	PERSON	, is '' the most vital question which can concern a citizen '' ; `` the subject is one of transcendent im - portance , perhaps more universally important than any other that can invite public attention '' ; it has to do with '' a class of transactions which , more than almost any other , are determinative of the distribution of wealth , the forms in which industry shall be exerted , and the sphere of personal liberty . ''

		Again , we read that this subject '' really constitutes more than almost any other element the essence of history , and that the record of the results that have followed the attempts to establish almost every form of taxation that human ingenuity can devise , has even in a very high degree the attraction of romance . ''

		This record of those attempts , encyclo - paedic in its range and its disregard of system , constitutes a very chaos of important historical and legal facts .

		How well entitled the author is to speak with authority on the subject of taxation is illustrated by the circumstance that his chapter on '' Recent Tax Experiences of the

		J THE DIAL 177 man of the
Revenue Commission	ORGANIZATION	and Special Com - missioner of the Revenue from
1865	DATE	to
1870	DATE	; while the germ of another part of the work may be found in the reports of the
New York	LOCATION	Tax Com - mission of 1870-72 , of which he was Chairman .

		Yet Mr.
Wells	PERSON	was unorthodox in his fundamental theory of taxation , conceiving taxes to be '' the compensation which persons and property pay the State for protection , '' or '' the equivalent for the protection which the
Government	ORGANIZATION	affords to the property of its citizens , '' and implying that they ` should therefore be proportioned to the benefit re - ceived ; while most contemporary writers on taxa - tion reject this theory and hold that taxes should be in proportion to the ability to pay .

		It is there - fore rather startling to find the protection theory of taxation advanced as one which is '' held by every authority , '' though it would not be incorrect to say that it persists in the popular mind , being appar - ently in accord with the general conception of jus - tice , while the acceptance of the other theory requires a less individualistic and more altruistic attitude of mind .

		Another theory of the author 's which has never been generally accepted is that all taxes which are uniformly levied `` diffuse and equate themselves by natural laws in the same manner and in the same minute degree as all other elements that constitute the expenses of produc - tion , '' so that upon whatever objects taxes are levied in the first instance , they will really be paid by all members of the community in proportion to their expenditures for consumption . ''

		Every dealer in domestic or imported merchandise keeps on hand , at all times , upon his shelves , a stock of different and accumulated taxes customs , internal revenue ,
State	ORGANIZATION	, school , and municipal with his goods ; and when we buy and carry away an article from any store or shop , we buy and carry away with it the ac - companying and inherential taxes . '' ''

		All taxation ultimately and necessarily falls on consumption ; and the burden of every man , under any equitable system of taxation , and which no effort will enable him to avoid , will be in the exact proportion or ratio which his aggreate consumption maintains to the aggregate consumption of the taxing district ,
State	ORGANIZATION	, or community of which he is a member . ''

		That this is approximately true of some taxes will not be denied ; but that it is equally true of all forms of taxation no one believes nowadays except Mr.
Edward Atkinson	PERSON	, who claims the honor of having persuaded Mr.
Wells	PERSON	.

		To the principal deductions which Mr.
Wells	PERSON	draws from his two heterodox principles there need be little exception taken ; for they are simply -LRB- 1 -RRB- that property should be taxed only by
the State	ORGANIZATION	and taxing district in which it is situated , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- that it is unnecessary to tax everything in order to bring about a just distribution of the burden .

		One sus - pects that the unnecessarily far-reaching principles may have been formulated in the author 's mind for the sake of these practical conclusions .

		The general property tax of the
United States	LOCATION	, which attempts to tax nearly everything and taxes personal pro- perty wherever the owner resides , is condemned as '' the most imperfect system of taxation that ever existed . ''

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	would limit taxation to tan - gible property , and perhaps to real estate ; and would supplement it by a tax on building occu - pancy , or rentals , and by taxing corporations on their franchises .

		It is unfortunate that he did not develop these proposals more fully , as perhaps he might have done if he had lived a few months longer ; though other parts of the book would have been improved by condensation .

		After the author 's death the duty of seeing the work through the press fell upon Mr.
Worthington	PERSON	C.
Ford	ORGANIZATION	.

		The attempt to discuss historically and philo - sophically the entire subject of public finance , `` including the monetary system of the
United States	LOCATION	, '' within less than four hundred pages of small size , is not calculated to arouse great expec - tations ; but in the case of Professor
Daniels	PERSON	' text - book the impression made upon the reader is one of surprise that the subject should be so well treated in so small a volume .

		The author is an adept in condensation ; and his independence and freshness of thought and his facility of expression combine to make his work interesting and perspicuous .

		Of course , the treatment is only cursory ; the part de - voted to '' Government Outlay '' contains little more than illustrative statistics of government ex - penditure , and the one hundred and fifty pages devoted to taxation are too few to permit a dis - cussion of all the taxes included in a modern fiscal system .

		A reviewer disposed to be hypercritical might go on to say that where the space was so limited there was scarcely room for a digression of eleven pages on the development of privately - owned railways , even though it led up to a discus - sion of government ownership more germaine to the general subject ; and that the problems con - nected with railways and municipal monopolies are not most appropriately treated under the head of `` Government Income . ''

		To this it might be added that the sources from which the author derives his facts are not always the most authoritative or of the latest possible date .

		The inclusion of a chap - ter on the currency system will not tend to lessen the existing popular confusion between monetary science and finance , but the author does succeed in relating this chapter to the rest of the book by con - sidering coinage and the issue of paper money as among the necessary functions of government .

		It would be hardly fair to take exception to the argu - ment in points of detail , because the author has not allowed himself space to state his positions on con - troverted questions fully ; so it will suffice to call attention to his interesting and not unsuccessful attempt to formulate canons of customs taxation applicable alike to protectionist and free-trade tariffs , and to his conservative attitude toward all proposals to extend governmental functions .

		On the railway question , for example , while admitting 178 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, that `` laws limiting rates and dividends are uni - versally ineffectual , and laws against unjust dis - crimination are frequently evaded or defied , '' and '' that a certain persistence of unjust discrimination as well as of competitive waste seems under present circumstances to be inevitable , '' he marshals such a formidable array of the evils which would follow upon public ownership that he '' Puzzles the will .

		And makes us rather bear those ills we have . ''

		To the series of monographs on the finances of particular States , appearing from time to time from one or another of the universities ,
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	contributes a collection of short studies of the tax - ing systems of
Maryland	LOCATION	,
North Carolina	LOCATION	,
Kansas	LOCATION	,
Mississippi	LOCATION	, and
Georgia	LOCATION	, written respectively by Dr.
Thomas S. Adams	PERSON	, Mr.
George E. Barnett	PERSON	, Mr.
Elbert J. Benton	PERSON	, Dr.
Charles H. Brough	PERSON	, and Dr.
Laurence F. Schmeckebier	PERSON	.

		The five papers originated in informal class reports , prepared by the authors as students in the university , which proved so interesting as to make it worth while to elaborate and publish them .

		A uniform plan of treatment was adopted , in accordance with which each essay opens with a description of the economic or industrial characteristics of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, followed in turn by a sketch of its general financial system , an historical account of the development of taxation , an examination of the various taxes now employed , and , finally , a critical conclusion containing sug - gestions for reform , and a `` bibliographical note . ''

		The suggestions offered are uniformly conservative , not proposing to do away at once with the general property tax , whatever its faults , but only to elim - inate its most glaring defects and supplement it with other sources of revenue , such as inheritance , income , and general corporation taxes .

		It is no - ticeable that in four cases out of five progressive rates are favored . ''

		If the several essays possess any particular significance , and if there be any unity underlying the volume , '' Professor
Hollander	PERSON	says by way of introduction , '' it is as emphasizing the impracticability of any universal application of commonly accepted principles of tax reform . ''

		Dr.
Joseph A. Hill	PERSON	has made a most exhaustive and painstaking study of the English income tax , both by personal inquiries made on the ground in
1897	DATE	for the
Massachusetts Tax Commission	ORGANIZATION	, and by examination of published materials .

		After a brief historical introduction , he gives an account of the five schedules or divisions into which the tax is divided for convenience of assessment and collec - tion at the sources of income , and then takes up the machinery and process of assessment in much detail .

		Where the principle of '' stoppage at source '' can not be applied , as in the case of income from trades and professions and from foreign in - vestments , the English income tax is subject to evasion much as other income and property taxes are ; but Dr.
Hill	PERSON	finds good reasons for believing that the assessment is becoming more efficient and complete , and regards the tax on the whole as fairly satisfactory .

		There are features of administration connected with the English income tax which ought to prove suggestive to American legislators ; such , for example , as the system of supervision by in - spectors and surveyors of the assessments made by local boards , which results practically in effective central control without violating the principle of local self-government .

		The question of the relation between local and general finances , discussed by Mr.
Sydney J. Chapman	PERSON	, is a live issue in
Great Britian	LOCATION	, and has occasionally been raised in this country also , as by the recent
Massachusetts Tax Commission	ORGANIZATION	; but to most American readers the most suggestive part of Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	's book will be the discussion of the distribution of work between local and central governments , by which he approaches the fiscal problem .

		Starting from the principles that matters chiefly of local interest must be undertaken by local governments , and those chiefly of national interest by the central government , and that the distribution of functions must be made according to the capacities and efficiencies of the governing bodies , he concludes that '' the matters assigned to local bodies should be those in which local knowl - edge is requisite , minute supervision essential , and the cooperation of private and governmental agen - cies likely to be of appreciable value ; and those in which the need for uniformity is least evident , or in which even diversity in administration is desirable . ''

		Finally , we must notice that local governments have a wonderful power of adapting themselves to cir - cumstances .

		By undertaking a higher quality of work they attract to their boards higher ability .

		Hence dif - ficult undertakings calling for tact , large knowledge , and perhaps some genius , which can not at first be safely placed in the hands of local bodies without the most zealous supervision , may in a few years be wholly handed over to them with perfect confidence . ''

		As between the two ethical principles that those interested should bear the cost of governmental operations in proportion to their interests , and that the burden of cost should be distributed according to ability to bear it , Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	decides that '' in
States	LOCATION	approximating to confederacies , the first is the fundamental rule , but in those more closely re - sembling unitary bodies politic the second has the superior claim . ''

		His practical conclusions regard -
ing State	ORGANIZATION	financial aid to localities are that the policy of subventions is a very doubtful policy at best , and that the existing English system is espec - ially unreasonable .

		He would much prefer a sys - tem of self-sufficient local taxation .

		Mr.
Hugh H. Lusk	PERSON	, formerly a member of the
New Zealand Parliament	LOCATION	, has recently become known to the reading public of
America	LOCATION	as a con - tributor to the magazines and reviews .

		His resi - dence in
America	LOCATION	and his observations of social conditions here have led him to make certain com - parisions between the
United States	LOCATION	and
New Zealand	LOCATION	, especially as to economic tendencies and the legislative treatment of important public ques -
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 179 tions ; and these studies he has published under the curious title of '' Our Foes at Home . ''

		The foes referred to seem to be the landowners and capitalists of
America	LOCATION	, and above all the trusts , in which Mr.
Lusk	PERSON	sees no possibility of good except the ultimate downfall he predicts for them which , however , is not to be brought about easily or soon , but only when the evil becomes so great that men will endure it no longer .

		If the author is pessi - mistic when writing of
America	LOCATION	, he is nothing if not an optimist when writing of the social experi - ments of
New Zealand	LOCATION	; and it is much to be hoped that there is better foundation for his optimism than for his pessimism .

		At any rate , the chapters in which he relates
New Zealand	LOCATION	's experiences are of much more value than those in which he merely ex - presses his fears concerning
America	LOCATION	; and it may be considered unfortunate that there are fewer of the former than of the latter .

		Yet many of
New Zea	LOCATION	- land 's interesting experiments are briefly described , from the instructive land policy and the progressive tax on land to compulsory arbitration and old age pensions .

		The success of the labor legislation is attributed largely to the observance of two prin - ciples : -LRB- 1 -RRB- that the supervision or enforcement of the law must be largely or wholly committed to the class for whose protection it is designed , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- that the penalties for its violation must be such as appeal with special force to the class of persons likely to incur them .

		The claim that government ownership is unfavorable to enterprise is met by statistics showing that the government of
New Zealand	LOCATION	has built more lines of railroad per capita of population than the railway companies of
America	LOCATION	, and that the extent of telegraph lines and the number of messages sent are both between three and four times as great in proportion to population in
Australasia	LOCATION	as in
America	LOCATION	.

		In all
New Zealand	LOCATION	's legislative experiments , Mr.
Lusk	PERSON	says in explanation of their success , the interests of the people as a whole were considered , and not those of any one class : the interests of the millionaire and the great land-owner were no more considered than those of the laboring man or of the home-seeker .

		The book contains much that is of interest , but it can not be recommended as a work of reference because there is no index and no very serviceable table of contents .

		Brief history of
Modern Spain	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Martin A. S. Hume	PERSON	is well quali - fied by his studies of Spanish life and history to write the monograph on '' Modern
Spain	LOCATION	'' in the '' Stories of the Nations '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		As is but natural in a work necessarily brief , attention is primarily directed toward purely political history , the result being a very readable story of wars , changes in government , and political intrigues from the time of
Charles IV.	PERSON	, to the pres - ent day .

		If in addition to this the author had been able to present concisely and impressively an analy - sis of those tendencies in Spanish character and in - stitutions which , for more than mere political events , have influenced the development of modern
Spain	LOCATION	, he would have produced a really notable book .

		No proper understanding of Spanish history is possible without a knowledge of the separatist and local ten - dencies of the provinces of
Spain	LOCATION	, of the perpetua - tion of old historical differences , of the distinct race feeling , all working against harmonious national ac - tion .


Spain	LOCATION	has , in fact , always lacked that sense of a solidarity of interests which has been so potent a force in creating the present day nationalities of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Ignorant provincial jealousies have yielded to united effort only in resistance to an outward foe , stimulated by a certain pride in the hazily remem - bered greatness of the nation centuries ago .

		Of the political history of
Spain	LOCATION	, as given by Mr.
Hume	PERSON	, there is little to be said save that it is well written and interesting and arranged in an orderly manner .

		The most entertaining portion of the book is that dealing with the character and activities of the
Regent Christina	ORGANIZATION	, wife of
Ferdinand VII	ORGANIZATION	.

		; and here possibly the author differs from other histori - ans .

		His portraiture of
Christina	PERSON	makes her more gentle , more lovable , more truly patriotic and womanly than other writers have pictured her .

		Her sister
Carlotta	ORGANIZATION	, wife of the second brother of Ferdinand VII. , is made the real factor in securing and maintaining the famous Frogmatic Sanction which inaugurated the Carlist wars .

		Christina is also acquitted of the charge of double-dealing in her conflict with Espartero in
1840	DATE	, for , according to Mr.
Hume	PERSON	, she was at least technically within her constitutional right in refusing to set aside by royal edict a law previously passed by the
Cortez	LOCATION	.

		Indeed , she could not legally do this .

		The contro - versy in question marked the beginning of an or - ganized liberal party in
Spain	LOCATION	, and the impress then given to it , and to all Spanish liberal move - ments , still exists in Spanish politics .

		The liberals turned to revolution and lawlessness as the shortest road to securing their aims , a plan readily adopted by the party in opposition ; so that from that time to this , revolution has always been a certain re - source in times of political discontent .

		Mr.
Hume	PERSON	considers this readiness to appeal to riot the key - note to Spanish character , inbred in the spirit of the nation , and constituting the greatest danger to the proper development of the Spanish state .

		The strange case of Mile .

		Smith .

		Professor Th .

		Flournoy 's curious book , '' From
India	LOCATION	to the Planet Mars , '' an account of the author 's experiments with the noted ''
Geneva	LOCATION	Medium , '' '' He `` lene
Smith	PERSON	, '' now in its third French edition , has been translated into English by
Daniel B. Vermilye	PERSON	, and is published in a comely volume by the Messrs.
Harper	PERSON	.

		The author is Professor of Psychology at
Geneva University	ORGANIZATION	, and ''
Helene Smith	PERSON	, '' it may be well to say , is a pseudonym .

		Professor
Flournoy	PERSON	first met `` Mile .

		Smith '' in 180 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16 , 1894	DATE	, and since that date has been an interested student of her personality and performances which are certainly remarkable enough even from the most common-sense point of view . ''

		Mile .

		Smith '' -LRB- we learn -RRB- has '' no fewer than three dis - tinct somnambulistic romances , '' two of them con - nected with the '' spiritistic '' idea of previous existences ; for it has been '' revealed '' that `` Mile .

		Smith '' has already lived twice before on this globe , once as the daughter of an Arab sheik and favorite wife of a Hindoo prince of Kanara -LRB- temp .

		1401 -RRB- , and again , in the
last century	DATE	, as
Marie Antoinette	PERSON	. ''

		Again reincarnated , '' says Professor
Flournoy	PERSON	gravely , '' as a punishment for her sins and -LSB- for -RSB- the perfecting of her character , in the humble circumstances of He ` lene
Smith	PERSON	, she in cer - tain somnambulistic states recovers the memory of her glorious avatars of old , and becomes again for the moment Hindoo princess or queen of
France	LOCATION	. ''

		Thus , let us add in plain terms , `` Mile .

		Smith '' is , in a sense , at one and the same time a sort of mental or mnemonic composite of Princess
Siman	PERSON	- dini -LRB- circa 1400 -RRB- , `` Madame Veto '' -LRB- guillotined in
1793	DATE	-RRB- , and '' He `
lene Smith	PERSON	, '' bookkeeper for a
Geneva	LOCATION	firm and amateur medium for , it is fair to say , '' Mile .

		Smith '' takes no pay for her per - formances .

		But this is not all , for in her '' third romance , '' or '' Martian cycle '' as the author calls it , `` Mile .

		Smith , '' by virtue of the '' mediumistic faculties which are the appanage and the consola - tion of her present life , has been able to enter into relation with the people and affairs of the planet Mars , and to unveil their mysteries to us . ''

		To the plain reader all this will probably seem sheer lunacy or sheer humbug ; but we hasten to say that to all who can take a serious interest in its subject - matter Professor
Flournoy	PERSON	's book will doubtless appear as important as interesting .

		The first volume of
Bailey	PERSON	's '' Cy - clopaedia of American Horticulture '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- was reviewed in THE DIAL of
April 16 last	DATE	.

		In that review the general scope and tone of this twentieth century cyclopaedia were indicated , as well as the qualifications of Pro- fessor
Bailey	PERSON	for undertaking such an enterprise .

		There is nothing more to be said in reference to the second volume , which has now appeared , further than that the high standard set by the first has been more than maintained in the second .

		A second volume , appearing at an interval after the first , is usually the better on account of the experience which the first has brought .

		The present volume begins with '' Earth nut '' and ends with '' Myrtus , '' and contains 544 pages .

		The work of illustration continues most excellent , and the half-tones from photographs are fine examples of the engraver 's art .

		The plate of muskmelons , for example , is particularly clear in detail .

		A timely article on mushrooms is written by Professor

		wonder that this enterprise has been no more de - veloped in this country .

		Two articles by Professor
Barnes	PERSON	of the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, one upon Fertilization , the other upon Flowers , are good ex - amples of the morphological standard of the work .

		They are clear and complete , and written from the most modern standpoint .

		The treatment of the States from the horticultural standpoint is of great interest and importance to many .

		It so happens that the present volume contains a goodly number of such papers , and among the States is
Illinois	LOCATION	, whose horticultural output and possibilities are stated by Professor
J. C. Blair	PERSON	of the Experiment Station at
Champaign	LOCATION	.

		It is hard to see how those interested in plants , either from the technical or cultural standpoint , could find a better cyclo - paedia of general and accurate information than Professor
Bailey	PERSON	is providing .

		Two more volumes will complete the work .

Mr R R Inglig	ORGANIZATION	p a l grave ' 8 '' Dictionary of Political Economy '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- beside its fellows upon the reference shelf .

		The work has been twelve years in making , although only three were allotted it at the start , and has been extended to one more volume than was at first contemplated .

		Similar works have existed for some years in both French and German , but noth - ing of the sort has heretofore been done in English , for
Lalor	PERSON	's '' Cyclopaedia '' has a very different scope and purpose , being rather a collection of elaborate essays than a dictionary made up of thousands of articles .

		The rapid advance of economic theory will doubtless make some portions of this work antiquated within a very few years , but its historical features -LRB- and it is essentially historical in method -RRB- will pre - serve its usefulness for a long time to come , and make it invaluable for purposes of consultation .

		It is extremely fortunate that this closing year of the nineteenth century , of the century in which political economy has taken so important and distinctive a position among the sciences , should have seen the completion of this comprehensive conspectus of what economic science has done , what it now is , and with what eyes it looks forward toward the future .

		The list of contributors includes the names of the most eminent authorities in
England	LOCATION	, the Continent , and the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The share taken by our own countrymen in this work is a matter for national self-congratulation .

		An elaborate analytical index , extending to upward of sixty double-columned pages , materially enhances the usefulness of the work .

		There are maps and charts , a number of pictures of the historic homes on the
James	LOCATION	, some reproduc - tions of early prints of
Jamestown	LOCATION	, and a few other illustrations of importance .

		One of the most inter - esting chapters is that which gives the origin of the names used along the river from
Newport News	ORGANIZATION	to

Anthony Wayne	PERSON	and selected troops under him , ranks among the most famous achieve - ments in American military annals .

		The difficulties in the way were so discouraging , the dangers were so great , and , on the other hand , the success attained was so conspicuous , that no criticism was ever made in the army of the Revolution , but the universal sentiment among soldiers and citizens alike was one of rejoicing .

		The recent purchase of the his - toric spot by the State of
New York	LOCATION	, as a result of the efforts of the '' Society for the Preservation of Scenic and Historic Places and Objects in
New York	LOCATION	, '' seems to have been the inspiration for the publication of Professor
Johnston	PERSON	's volume of over two hundred pages , half of them taken up with a study of the military situation which made the affair at
Stony Point	ORGANIZATION	specially important -LRB-
James T. White & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		A number of contemporary maps and charts help to a correct understanding of the skilfulness of the movements of the men in the difficult and dangerous night attack .

		The re - maining pages are filled with a collection of docu - ments , fifty-six in number , which have been gathered from English and American storehouses , furnishing abundant original material .

		A number of modern photographs , with portraits of leading officers , add interest to the volume .

		The author would be abundantly repaid for his careful study , if renewed attention to the famous assault should lead to the erection of a suitable monument upon the historic promontory .

		A book on American woman of property

John Howard Cromwell	PERSON	's `` The American Business Woman '' CPutnam -RRB- at once a handy practical manual in business methods , and a sound and conservative guide , philosopher , and friend , in the more theoretical side of the useful art of taking care of one 's treasure in a world where moth and rust do corrupt , and where thieves of various sorts , from the sheer burglar with his `` jimmy '' down to the smooth `` promoter '' with his glib tongue and lying prospectus , do break through and steal .

		Mr.
Cromwell	PERSON	is a member of the
New York	LOCATION	bar ; and he declares that in the whole course of a long pro- fessional experience , during which many of his clients have been women , he has met , or can recall , but one woman '' whose acquaintance with regular business methods would , among men , be considered even ordinary . ''

		The state of things thus indicated calls aloud for a remedy ; and as a remedy we sug - gest a thorough study of Mr.
Cromwell	PERSON	's carefully prepared book by the class for whose use it is written .

		In it will be found special chapters on banks and their functions and usages , savings banks , trust companies , safe deposit companies , bonds and stocks , mortgages , real property , pro- bate matters , the legal status of married women , etc. .

		In short , the book is judiciously compounded of sound principles and practical directions , and will amply repay study .

		The work covers the

		The first three chapters are given to
England	LOCATION	, and constitute about one half of the vol - ume .

		The three remaining chapters deal with
France	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	, and `` other countries , '' respect - ively .

		There is also an introduction and a con - clusion , neither of which could be made very satisfactory on account of the somewhat arbitrary limits assigned to the period under review .

		Mr.
Omond	PERSON	's criticisms of individual writers are nec - essarily brief , and they seem to us , on the whole , singularly just .

		Sometimes they are more than just they are exceptionally felicitous as when we read that '' if anyone has caught up
Keats	PERSON	's un - uttered song it is surely
Tennyson	PERSON	, '' or when we are told of
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	's later poems that '' what strikes us is surely strength no less than beauty , masculine vigour wedded to ethereal grace . ''

		We have noted but few slips -LRB- such as `` Chartreux `` for `` Chartreuse '' in the title of
Stendhal	ORGANIZATION	's famous novel -RRB- where many would have been easily possible .

		Education as an evolution .

		The name of
Thomas Davidson	PERSON	on the title-page of an educational book is a guarantee that the work shows wide reading , has been well thought out , and is carefully written .

		The competent reader may not always agree with what the author says , but he is 182 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, little likely to deny that the work possesses any one of these three qualities .

		Mr.
Davidson	PERSON	's `` History of Education '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- bears all these well - known marks .

		The author 's conception of his sub - ject is a broad one . ''

		Education is a. conscious or voluntary evolution .

		Hence history of education is a record of such evolution , and begins at the point where man takes himself into his own hands , so to speak , and seeks to guide his life towards an ever more definite , coherent heterogeneity , which is what we mean by his ideal end . ''

		Accordingly , his first chapter is entitled '' The Rise of Intelligence , '' and the second one '' Savage Education . ''

		Mr.
David	PERSON	- son spreads his facts on the framework of his theory of the world , which is the conception of evolution , but evolution with God , freedom , and immortality .

		Whether by so doing he does violence to his facts , is a question that might lead to contradictory answers .

		The book is an able one , but in no sense elementary .

		It does not meet the needs of readers who have not already a considerable knowledge of the subject ; accordingly , only a small minority of teachers will read it or can read it .

		The book must be pronounced a useful one for the general reader who wishes to get at the essential facts about these great Italians , and to learn briefly in what sort and degree they left the world and their country in their debt .

		Mr.
Horridge	PERSON	writes sensibly and enter - tainingly , and primarily for the instruction of his read - ers .

		The work is produced primarily under the auspices of the Danish government , and will be illus - trated by
Herr Hans Tegner	PERSON	, who has devoted eleven years to his task .

		Volume III .

		of Miss
Sarah H. Killikelly	PERSON	's '' Curious Questions in History , Literature , Art , and Social Life , '' has just been published by Mr.
David McKay	PERSON	.

		It pro- vides a singular miscellany of information upon out-of - the way subjects , thrown together without any pretense of logical arrangement , and illustrated by over a hun - dred full-page plates .

		`` Stories of the
Badger State	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
Reuben Gold Thwaites	PERSON	, has been published by the
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is an important addition , by a first-class au - thority , to the series of supplementary reading-books in which it appears , and the publishers are once more to be congratulated upon their success in enlisting the best American writers in this enterprise . ''

		English Composition and Literature '' is a text - book prepared by Mr.
W. F. Webster	PERSON	, and published by
Messrs. Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It provides for the systematic reading and study of a considerable number of literary masterpieces , most of which are ac - cessible in the '' Riverside Literature '' series .

		The suggestions for special work and the test-questions added to each chapter form a particularly valuable feature of this publication .

		Dr.
Murray	PERSON	, in a recent lecture on '' The Evolution of English Lexicography , '' makes some interesting com - parisons between the progress of the '' New English Dictionary '' and similar enterprises , much to the credit of the Oxford undertaking .

		The ''
Deutsches Worter	PERSON	- buch '' of the
Grimm	PERSON	brothers , begun in
1852	DATE	, is just reaching the letter S .

		The Dutch ''
Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal	PERSON	, '' begun in
1852	DATE	, is not yet half - finished .

		The new '' Vocabolario della Crusca , '' starting
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 188 in
1863	DATE	, has just reached I , and will require another quarter-century for its completion .

		Yet none of these works is in reality so comprehensive an undertaking as the '' New English Dictionary . ''

		A new English monthly review , of the half-crown type , is to begin publication at once .

		Edited by Mr.
Henry Newbolt	PERSON	, with the imprint of Mr.
John Murray	PERSON	, it promises to take a conspicuous place among periodi - cals of its class .

		Its special features will include a serial novel , original poetry , literary criticism , illustra - tions , and a permanent editorial section .

		A '' Victorian History of the Counties of
England	LOCATION	'' is projected , to fill no less than one hundred and sixty large volumes , and to enlist the services of the most famous scholars .

		Mr.
H. Arthur Doubleday	PERSON	is to be the gen - eral editor of this work , which will be published by
Messrs. Archibald Constable & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The price of sub - scription is fixed at two hundred and forty guineas .

		Messrs.
T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	announce a new and complete edition of Balzac in English , under the edito - rial supervision of Professor
W. P. Trent	PERSON	.

		The edition will take three forms , two of them filling sixteen vol - umes each , the other being an edition de luxe in thirty - two volumes .

		Mr.
Trent	PERSON	's introductions will comprise bibliographical matter , condensed information about the leading characters , cross-references , and literary criti - cism based chiefly upon Balzac 's correspondence .

		The editor will also supply a long general introduction , and a '' Note on the order of reading the Comedy . ''

		The twelfth volume , bound in handsome red covers , of the '' Land of Sunshine '' -LRB-
Los Angeles	LOCATION	-RRB- is a pleas - ant reminder of the steady advance of this brave little periodical along the difficult path of magazine enter - prise , of its progress not only in years but in influence and substantiality .

		The distinction it has won of being the best there is in periodical literature on the
Pacific Coast	LOCATION	is in itself much , and the '' Land of Sunshine '' has , besides , the devoted services of an editor who throws into it the force of an ability and an individual - ity powerful enough and original enough to give dis - tinction to any periodical .

		The scientific portions of the magazine evince the editor 's scholarship and scru - pulous care , while the very material portions written by him are so fresh in style and treatment , so teeming with his abounding personality , that the publication might perhaps well be named ''
Lummis	PERSON	's Magazine . ''

		It is doubtless a daring thing for such a publication to undertake to discuss , with the frankness and vigor which are the mark of all Mr.
Lummis	PERSON	's writings , cur - rent questions of national and universal concern ; its utterances must often , if not usually , be on the unpop - ular side , and can only be saved , and the magazine with them , by the absolute honesty of conviction and seriousness of purpose which are felt to lie behind them .

		Constituents and associates who dissent from Mr.
Lummis	PERSON	's vigorous and somewhat unsparing utter - ances may yet respect his courage and his honesty , and find their compensation in seeing their region accred - ited by him with furnishing the best that the
Pacific Coast	LOCATION	has to offer in the periodical literature of the time .

		He has rendered them the immeasurable service of giving them a voice , and one that is listened to with respect and interest in all parts of the country .

		We are glad to note the constant improvement in the number and quality of the illustrations of this maga - zine , and , by no means last , the evidences of increasing prosperity shown in its advertising pages .

		ANNOUNCEMENTS OF FALL , BOOKS .

		THE DIAL 'S list of forthcoming Fall publications , presented herewith , is the largest of any in the history of the American book trade .

		The number of titles entered is 1700 , against about 1600 last year .

		This list is prepared entirely from advance information secured especially for the purpose , and represents the output of 78 publishing firms : the highest number of titles from one firm being 200 , and the average 22 for each firm .

		All the books here given are presumably new books new editions not being included unless having new form or matter ; and the list does not in - clude Fall books already issued and entered in our regular List of New Books .

		Juvenile books are , from their great number , deferred to another issue .

		The more interesting literary features of the List are commented upon in the leading editorial in this issue .

D. APPLETON & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's NEW BOOKS THE STORY OF THE SOLDIER By General
G. A. FORSYTE	PERSON	,

		Illus - trated by
R. F. ZOGBAUM	PERSON	.

		A new volume in the Story of the West Series , edited by
RIPLEY HITCHCOCK	ORGANIZATION	.

		12mo , cloth ,
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		In the great task of opening the empire west of the
Missouri	LOCATION	the American regular soldier has played a part as large and heroic as it is unknown .

		The purpose of this book , written by a gallant officer who has been a part of what he writes , is to picture the American soldier in the life of exploration , reconnaisances , establishing posts , guarding wagon trains , repressing outbreaks , or battling with hostile Indians , which has been so large a part of the army 's active work for a hundred years .

		To this work
General Forsyth	ORGANIZATION	furnishes perspective and back - ground by tracing the origin of the regular soldier , the popular feeling regarding him , and his relation to politics and the militia , his training and the manner in which he has borne the brunt of war at the outset of real war from the inception of the
Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		In his task as the pioneer of civilization in the West the soldier is shown as explorer witness the
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	and Pitse expeditions as the protector of wagon trains and railroad builders , and his active service is illus - trated in
General Forsyth	ORGANIZATION	's brilliant and dramatic accounts of the great Indian campaigns of the
West	LOCATION	.

		His story of the soldier presents a fresh and thrilling chapter of American history .

		The book does justice to the heroic and little appreciated figure of the regular soldier , and it illustrates the gallant and thankless achievements of men like those who have just passed from us
Lawton	LOCATION	,
Henry	PERSON	, and Liscum .

		Such a book has been peculiarly needed outside of its epic quality and thrilling interest .

		Americana will read it with pride and with a won - der not unmixed with shame that the regular soldier has been so long ignored by his fellow-countrymen .

		COMMODORE PAUL JONES By

$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		As a writer upon naval life from the point of view of the historical romancer , Mr.
Brady	PERSON	stands at the head of the American writers of this generation .

		He is a historian as well as a novelist , and his his - torical and biographical work has attracted marked attention on account of the knowledge , the grasp of theme , and the power of sym - pathetic discernment which he has shown .

		A
Life of Paul Jones	ORGANIZATION	by Mr.
Brady	PERSON	represents a peculiarly felicitous union of author and theme .

		There is no more picturesque and heroic figure in naval his - tory than that of the doughty little captain who fought and captured the Serapis when his own ship was sinking under him .

		His career presented features which have proved puzzling to some writers , and the work which Mr.
Brady	PERSON	has done in clearing up his life , and in presenting a lucid narrative enriched with extracts from
Paul Jones	PERSON	's more important correspondence has a peculiar and permanent value .

		Mr.
Brady	PERSON	's vigorous style , his vivid imagination and dramatic force are most happily exhibited in this book .

		It fully deserves to be called more fascinating than most romances .

		THE INDIVIDUAL A Study of Life and Death by Professor
N. S. SHALER	PERSON	of
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	.

		12mo , cloth ,
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		The lucidity and suggestiveness of Professor
N. S. Shaler	PERSON	's writ - ings , whether they are expositions of scientific themes or discussions which touch upon sociological topics , will induce readers to await with especial interest his forthcoming book , ' `` The Individual : A Study of Life and Death , '' which is a striking and noble presentation of the subject of death from a fresh point of view .

		Professor
Shaler	PERSON	's book is one of deep and permanent interest .

		He points out that while the problems of natural selection and evolution have called attention to the results which come from the temporary quality of the individ - ual , they have not heretofore led to any extended interest in the rela - tion of the ephemeral nature of the individual to the other individu - alities of the universe and to the method of its organization .

		In his preface he writes as follows : '' In effect this book is a plea for an education as regards the place of the individual life in the whole of Nature which shall be consistent with what we know of the universe .

		It is a plea for an understanding of the relations of the person with the realm which is , in the fullest sense , his own ; with his fellow-beings of all degrees which are his kinsmen ; with the past and the future of which he is an integral part .

		It is a protest against the idea , bred of many natural misconceptions , that a human being is something apart from its fellows ; that it is born into the world and dies out of it into the loneliness of a supernatural realm .

		It is this sense of isolation which , more than all else , is the curse of life and the sting of death . ''

Max Pemberton	PERSON	's brilliant pen has shown that '' the true romancer '' lives to-day .

		Mr.
Pemberton	PERSON	chooses the present and not the histor - ical past , and he proves that the life of to-day may suggest romance , mystery , incident , and adventure in as fascinating forms as the life of the days of lance and armor .

		His new novel deals with Russian social and political intrigue , a field wherein he is fully at home .

		There is a charming love story which is carried through a stirring series of ad - ventures to a fortunate end .

		Mr.
Pemberton	PERSON	's romance , which is full of life and vivid in its unflagging interest , shows perhaps the highest mark which he has reached in his successful career as a romancer .

		240 THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE MIND .

		In the history of architecture there have been two predominant types , the Greek and the Gothic .

		Each of them has undergone his - torical modifications , in accordance with the changing needs of mankind , but each has nevertheless remained true to its fundamental ideal .

		In the case of Greek architecture , that ideal has comprised unity of design , symmetry of construction , and simple definite relations between the several parts .

		In the case of Gothic architecture , it has meant more atten - tion to detail than to the general plan , a dis - regard of severely proportioned lines , and a certain degree of confusion of aim .

		The dif - ference between the Parthenon and '' the Bible of
Amiens	LOCATION	, '' for example , illustrates a funda - mental divergence of method and of aspiration ; the two ideal types are here exhibited in the strongest of possible contrasts .

		Transferring now our attention from the single field of architecture to the broader domain of art in general , we find the same contrast of type exhibited wherever we look , although we broaden our terms to correspond with the wider view , and now say classical and romantic , in - stead of simply saying Greek and Gothic .

		The Parthenon is classical art , but so also are the '' Antigone '' and the
Hermes of Olympia	ORGANIZATION	and the Pompeian frescoes .

		So also are the fugues of Bach and the canvases of
David	PERSON	, and the '' Hellenics '' of Landor .

		On the other hand ,
Amiens	LOCATION	cathedral is romantic art , but so also are the sculptures of
Michelangelo	ORGANIZATION	and the plays of Shakspeare and the paintings of Ros - setti .

		In some sense even , as a foreshadowing of the romanticism of the modern Christian world , the measures of Pindar and of Virgil escape from the restraints of the classical spirit , and take the freer range which we attribute primarily to the form of art which it was the province of the Middle Ages and the
Renais	PERSON	- sance to develope in all its fulness of creative splendor .

		It does not seem to us an altogether fanciful analogy to find in the domain of the intellectual life , as distinguished from the creative , a sim - ilar divergence of fundamental types .

		We find the intellect whose characteristics are unity and symmetry and definite relationship of ac - tivities ; and we find the intellect with whose characteristics these are strongly contrasted , to which they are often diametrically opposed .

		In the first category we have the makers of systems , the men whose works exhibit an archi - tectonic character so evident that our attention is directed to the coherent whole rather than to the separate details .

		That is , each detail , however significant in itself , becomes much more significant when considered in relation to the entire logical structure .

		Such an intel - lect keeps itself well in hand , restrains the tendency to capricious expression , is firmly based upon certain fundamental ideas , and brings every vagrant fancy wherewith it is beset to the primary test of this essential conformity .

		We recognize this type of mind in
Euclid	LOCATION	, in
Aquinas	LOCATION	, in
Spinoza	LOCATION	, in Kant , and in Mr. 218 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	,
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	.

		In each individual case , we realize that the work must stand or fall as a whole , that , given a logical method of proced - ure , it will stand if the foundations are sound , and that if they are shaky the entire structure must totter to its
fall	DATE	.

		In the second of our categories we find those discursive intellects that are content to exhibit the separate facets of truth as it is revealed to them , that take sufficient satisfaction in its sparkling gleam , and make no effort to bring the light to a single focus .

		They feel instinc - tively that truth as a whole must be self-con - sistent , and leave to more systematic minds the task of reconciling seeming contradictions and of elucidating whatever appears paradox - ical .

		Such minds , when actively at work , live intensely in the present moment , leaving the past and the future to care for themselves , and giving slight heed to the accusation of inconsist - ency .

		To this intellectual type we accredit
Cicero	PERSON	-LRB- the epistolary and philosophical Cicero -RRB- Montaigne ,
Samuel Johnson	PERSON	-LRB- with all his crabbed prejudices -RRB- ,
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	,
Hume	PERSON	,
Ruskin	PERSON	, and
Emerson	LOCATION	.

		Probably the traditional clas - sification which makes of all men by nature either Aristotelians or Platonists is not very different from that which we have here sought to indicate .

		Each of these contrasted modes of the intel - lectual life has its own particular attendant dangers , and each needs the corrective influ - ence of the other .

		In the former case , there is always the danger of doctrinaireism , of twist - ing the truth to fit the preconceived scheme , of seeking to demand acceptance by the sheer force of logical coherency .

		Reverting to our architectural figure , there is always the danger of magnifying the importance of the structure qua structure , and of the consequent failure to adapt it to human needs .

		In the latter case , there is always the danger of encouraging a lax mental habit , of holding the requirements of logic too cheap , of allowing the impulse or the emotion of the moment to usurp the sway of the sovereign reason .

		The resulting structure is apt to be comparable to one of these com - posite buildings in which the eye is engaged by many fascinating details , but in which it can take no satisfaction as a whole .

		The natural bent of each individual who leads the intellectual life in any sort will fix the essential type to be aimed at .

		Each type has its peculiar satisfactions no less than its peculiar dangers .

		There are some who can conceive of no other ambition than that which seeks to make life of one piece , to shape its intellectual activities into a consistent whole .

		Every new idea must be brought to the test of those already accepted , must be examined and reexamined in the light of the principles that have been adopted as fundamentally important .

		This attitude toward truth is maintained at the cost of much strenuous endeavor , the severe repression of many a natural impulse , and the stern rejection of many a pleasing fancy .

		Viewed in retrospect , the reward seems suffi - cient ; but it is hard to keep the chords of the mind strung to the requisite pitch , and the temptation at times becomes great to break loose from the stiffening bonds of prescription , and give unimpeded play to the faculties .

		Minds of the other type and this is no doubt the prevailing one are considerably freer in their activities , and thereby more receptive of new impressions .

		The hobgoblin inconsistency has no terrors for them ; they are prepared at any time to take a new intellectual start , to ignore past conclusions , and to formulate fresh ones in accordance with the new light in which some truth seems to stand revealed .

		The pure reason is no longer the sole dictator of thought , but shares its empire in some measure with the forces that control the emotional life .

		This attitude finds its satisfactions in the intense realizations of the moment which it permits , in the part which it allows to the sense of won - der , and in the ever-alluring prospect of com - ing upon new gateways of truth .

		To declare for one or the other of these attitudes is prob - ably futile ; each thinking mind finds its choice already made by the time the instinctive and unconscious period of thought is past .

		And whether the philosophy of conduct be built up by the logical method of a Spinoza or by the haphazard method of a Montaigne , the prac - tical outcome is apt to be much the same with minds of normal endowment .

		We have discussed these contrasting men - tal attitudes with reference to the individuals whom they primarily concern ; let us in con - clusion discuss them with reference to their influence upon the stream of human thought .

		In the long run , do the systematic thinkers determine the intellectual currents of history , leaving only its eddies and surface-ripples to be shaped by the discursive thinkers ?

		Out - first thought is that they do .

		When we think of the immense authority , exercised for cen - tury after century , of an Aristotle or an
Aquinas	PERSON	, it seems as if such were the only in - tellectual forces that have counted .

		But a little
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 219 reflection will bring the counter-opinion into view , and make us doubt our hasty initial as - sumption .

		Systems have their day and become stripped of their authority , whereas no sincere expression of the human spirit , struck out in the glow of some moment of intense vision , ever wholly loses its validity .

		This is why the poets , on the whole , have influenced the thoughts of men more than the philosophers .

		We may take leave to doubt whether the '' Summa Theologies '' has , all things considered , proved so potent and penetrating an influence upon religious thought as the '' De Imitatione Christi , '' and we may confidently assert that , in the total reckoning , philosophical thought owes a greater debt to Plato than it does to
Aristotle	LOCATION	.

		The influence of the unsystematic writers is less imposing , but it seems to be farther-reaching than that of the architectonic thinkers .

		It is , after all , the open mind that makes possible all intellectual progress , and the mind of the systematic philosopher has too often but a single outlook , which may be in the wrong direction , turned toward the fading past rather than toward the glowing future of human thought .

		NIETZSCHE AND HIS PHILOSOPHY .

		By the death of
Friedrich Nietzche	PERSON	, the world has lost the most radical philosopher of the century , and one of the most picturesquely eccentric figures in all literature .

		While at first he was under the influence of the philosophy of
Schopenhauer	PERSON	and the artistic and aesthetic views of
Richard Wagner	PERSON	, he soon entered the arena as an absolutely inde - pendent thinker , with an entirely original philoso - phy , whose avowed object was to reform all modern culture , yea , to bring about a new epoch in the history of human civilization .

		The aphoristical style of the works of this second and principal period of
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's literary activity was a departure from all precedent .

		His work was done almost exclusively in the open air .

		Stopping still in his walks , or lying outstretched in a Swiss or Italian landscape , he would fix upon loose sheets the thoughts on men and things which crossed his brain , recording all the joy and pain of his soul in scintillating epigrams , full of deep thought , boldness , and sarcasm .

		Undoubtedly he has devoted much labor to the polishing of his sentences , so as to find the most expressive word , the most picturesque phrase , the most striking simile .

		His sentences have an enrapturing splendor , a bewitching grace , and a dramatic animation to which must very largely be attributed the great effect which his works have had upon his readers .

		Even those who do not admit the inspiration of Nietzsche the prophet , can relish Nietzsche the writer .

		He never wearies the reader by following the same train of thought for more than a page at a time , though it is true that the same idea crops up in fragmentary form over and over again .

		But no less wonderful than his power of language are the scope and breadth of his observations , the depth of his borings into the human heart , the boldness of his inconoclasm , the Promethean presumption with which he tramples under foot all the received standards of morality .

		The starting point of
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's philosophy is the formula that the '' will to power '' is the main -
spring	DATE	of life .

		`` What is good ? ''

		he asks . ''

		All that increases the feeling of power , will to power , power itself , in man . ''

		`` What is happiness ? '' ''

		The feeling that power increases , that resistance is overcome . ''

		The will to power is the tendency of every man to assert his ego , to give dominance to his inten - tions .

		Nietzsche finds not only in all the manifes - tations of unadulterated human nature , but of nature generally , this tyrannical and inexorable assertion of claims to power .

		Now , if one aims at predominance and extension of power , it means subordination and subjection for another .

		Then only can a higher culture be created , where there are two clearly distinguishable castes , the one to do the work of society , the other to enjoy true leisure , a caste of compulsory workers and a caste of free or voluntary workers .

		The ennoblement of the human race or , as
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	calls it , the eleva - tion of the type of `` man '' is the work of an aristocratic society , of a state of castes built upon suppression , subjection , and force .

		A thoroughly felt and asserted difference between class and class , the continuous looking down by the dominant caste upon their subjects and tools , and the equally con - tinuous practice of the two castes in commanding and obeying , respectively , result in what
Nietzsche	PERSON	styles the `` pathos of distance . ''

		Without this , there could never have arisen that other more mys - terious pathos , that desire for a constantly growing increase of the distance within the soul itself , the evolution of ever higher conditions , in short , the elevation of the type of man .

		A healthy aristocracy which will be a guarantee of ascending culture can not exist , according to
Nietzsche	LOCATION	, unless it realizes that it is itself the aim and object of human society .

		It must necessarily accept without the slightest scruples of conscience the sacrifice of countless human beings who for its sake must be depreciated to imperfect beings , to slaves and tools .

		The root of such an aristocracy is the conviction that society does not exist for its own sake , but merely as the frame and ground - work upon which a select kind of being , to-wit , that aristocracy , rises to the height of its task , the elevation of the type of man ; comparable to those climbing plants of
Java	LOCATION	which with their arms em - brace the oak tree so long that finally they creep and rise high above it , but , supported by it , develop and exhibit their crown in a higher and freer sphere .

		Thus , egoism , according to
Nietzsche	LOCATION	, is an 220 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, essential attribute of the noble soul which accepts the fact of its egoism without any question mark , without the slightest feeling of hardness , force , or arbitrariness ; on the contrary , as something which is founded in the very nature of things , as some - thing which is justice itself .

		The noble soul admits that there are others entitled to equal rights with itself ; it honors itself in them and in the rights which it accords to them ; it doubts not that the ex - change of honors and privileges is of the essence of all commerce between equals .

		It is clear to
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	that a dominant class must have different forms and views of life than a serving class .

		In his review of the many different systems of morality , be they coarser or finer , which among different peoples and at different times have governed the conduct of men ,
Nietzsche	PERSON	discovers two general types : a morality of aristocracy , which he calls Master Morality , and a morality of the domi - nated class , which he calls Slave Morality .

		Mas - ter Morality distinguishes between good and bad ; Slave Morality between good and evil .

		In the case of Master Morality , the exultation and pride of the soul is valued as '' good , '' while everything contrary to these conditions of the soul is valued as '' bad . '' ''

		Good '' is everything which the high - minded nobleman does ; '' bad '' or contemptible , is everything which the noble spirit dislikes .

		Bad and contemptible is the coward , the uneasy , the small , the suspicious , the conventionally moral , the relig - iously scrupulous , the one who is ever thinking of narrow utility , the one who humbles himself , the dog kind of man who tolerates mistreatment of himself .

		Thus all noble morality and view of life arise from aristocracy 's triumphant approval of its own doings .

		Not so with the morality and view of life of all dominated and dependent classes , the so-called Slave Morality .

		There the hatred of aristocracy , the craving for an alleviation of their condition , is uppermost in their moral valuations .

		The slave has a justifiable suspicion of everything which is honored as good by the dominant class .

		For what - ever is there '' good '' must needs hurt the oppressed , and is therefore regarded as `` evil '' in Slave Morality .

		On the other hand , the slaves have gratitude and appreciation for all the qualities which tend to lighten the burdens of the suffering and oppressed like pity , charity , warm hearted - ness , patience , industry , kindness .

		All these quali - ties are in Slave Morality classed as '' good . ''

		And now we can understand
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's form - ula , '' beyond good and evil . ''

		It means a realm removed from
Slave Morality	ORGANIZATION	, in which men are '' superior to the illusions of moral sentiment . ''

		Nietzsche deplores that in the battle between
Master Morality and Slave Morality	ORGANIZATION	, between Roman aristocratic method of valuation on the one hand and Jewish-Christian-plebeian on the other , the latter has been victorious along the whole line .

		The entire European civilization has received its decisive feature through the catchwords of Slave Morality , `` good '' and `` evil . ''

		Hence the ten - dency of European culture towards producing a coddled , pitiful , weak , and low-minded race , by valuing the greatest good to the greatest number as the highest maxim of society .

		This crime against life should be reversed by a thoroughgoing '' re - valuing '' of ethical values .

		This tendency should be arrested by aristocracy .

		It should deliver itself from the enervating principles of '' good and evil , '' should place itself '' beyond good and evil , '' should accept the only mode of valuation becoming to it , namely , the distinction between '' good '' and '' bad '' or '' contemptible ; '' it should again as - sume the reins of mastery , subjugate the masses and spoliate them for its purposes ; in short , it should again hold in high regard , and bring to fur - ther development , the proud instincts innate in man , and thereby save at least itself from degener - ation and decadence .

		With this achievement , a new , a higher , a more beautiful , a more powerful type of man will have been created .

		This ideal type
Nietzsche	PERSON	calls '' Uebermensch '' over-man , beyond-man .

		To cultivate these noble instincts , to breed this higher race everywhere and in suffi - cient numbers to fulfil their historical mission ,
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	advises those who confess this master morality of `` good '' and `` bad '' the `` emanci - pated spirits , '' as he calls them to live in solitude , away from the pitiable morality of the present so - ciety , which must make life unbearable to them .

		In `` Thus spake Zarathustra , '' Nietzsche apos - trophises these free spirits and prepares them for their tremendous task .

		One may easily imagine that this apostle of aris - tocracy has no patience with the doctrine of the equal rights of man .

		He thunders against it in a dozen keys and in a hundred variations .

		`` The bloody farce with which the French Revolution played itself out , its ' immorality , ' is of little account to me ; what I hate is its Rousseau-mora/ity the so-called ' truths ' of the Revolution with which it operates to the present day , and wins over to itself all the shallow and mediocre .

		The doctrine of equality !

		But there exists no deadlier poison ; for it seems to be preached by justice itself , while it does away with justice ... ' Equality to the equal , inequality to the unequal ' that would be the true teaching of justice ; and the corollary likewise , ' Never make the unequal equal . '

		That such dreadful and bloody events happened around the doctrine of equality , has given a sort of glory end luridness to this * modern idea ' par excellence ; so that the Revolution as a spectacle has seduced even the noblest minds .

		That is , after all , no reason for esteeming it any higher . ''

		Nietzsche is the deadly foe of Christian morality , of the teachings of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, because it antag - onizes the preservative instincts of life as sinful , as temptations ; because it is inimical to happiness on earth ; because it takes the part of the weak and the low against the higher type of man .

		He regards the concepts of '' the other world , '' '' last judgment , '' '' immortality of the soul , '' as inventions of the priest , as torture instruments by which he designed to and did become master .

		He arraigns the man of to-day , who can not be ignorant of these things , for still professing Christianity .

		With terrible force he exposes our hypocrisy by contrasting our un -
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 221 Christian acts in public and private life with our Christian professions .

		Says he : '' What happens to the last sentiment of seemliness , of respect for ourselves , when our statesmen even , otherwise a very unbiased species of men , and practical Anti-Christians through and through , call themselves Christians at the present day , and go to the communion ?

		... A prince at the head of his regiments , splendid as the expression of the selfishness and elation of his nation , but , without any shame , confess - ing himself a Christian I ... Whom then does Christianity deny ?

		What does it call the ' world ' ?

		To be a soldier , a judge , a patriot ; to defend one 's self ; to guard one 's honor ; to seek one 's advantage ; to be proud ... All practice of every hour , all instincts , all valuations realizing themselves in deeds , are at present An ti -
Christian	LOCATION	; what a monster of falsity must modern man be that he nevertheless is not ashamed to be still called a Christian . ''

		Nietzsche 's great mistake was to fight all tradi - tional morality as such , because some of its teachings were repulsive to him , because some of its teachers , especially the early disciples of Christ , went so far as to demand the annihilation of all natural instincts of man .

		The code of Christian morality , with its rigid asceticism , its thorough negation of every positive desire or will , can certainly not be more mistaken than
Nietzsche	PERSON	's im moral ism , with its un - bounded license , self-glorification , and self-indul - gence .

		If it is really necessary to revise our code of morals and that might be admitted , then the first thing necessary is to overcome this one-sided prejudice against the traditional concepts of moral - ity as a whole .

		The essence and end of all morality is the liber - ating of some latent force which is needed for the solution of the problems of civilization .

		The work of Christianity was to prepare and fit the half-bar - barous peoples of
Europe	LOCATION	for the task of civilization , for which there was slumbering in them an abun - dance of latent power .

		But this latent power had first to be made free and available by a thorough cleansing of their hearts and minds from the brutal instincts and desires , the coarse and primitive thoughts and views which possessed them .

		The purgative applied by Christianity to accomplish this cleansing process was asceticism , the negation of the senses .

		It was an heroic remedy ; but whether too heroic or not , one might well pause for an answer .

		It is this remedy which
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	so severely condemns .

		He judges all morality merely by its negative means and methods .

		Many of these we can and do safely dispense with nowadays , many of these we might in our present state of civi - lization recognize even as evils .

		Nietzsche has irrefutably established the hollowness and hypocrisy of many a paragraph in our code of morality .

		We might even disregard some of its positive commands .

		For example , it is not necessary that we should love our neighbor as well as we do ourselves , and we do not do it , either .

		But with all that , unless we are willing to respect the rights of others , whether rich or poor , mighty or weak ; unless we accord equal opportunities to all , no matter how constituted ; unless we fight selfishness and condemn the spoliation of the weak and unfortunate , there is an end of civilized society , and we resolve ourselves into a band of brutes .

		The aggregate of human happiness is certainly more increased by uplifting the masses than by the elevation of the few through the humbling of the many .

		Nor are the concepts of God , immortality , heaven and hell , indispensable ; for we know there are men , and many of them , who without such beliefs are honest and honorable , kind , and tolerant ; who love truth , despise falsehood , practice charity , con - quer egoism , all without hope of reward or fear of punishment in this or another world ; who recognize the existence of moral laws of nature , as they do the laws of the physical world ; who are ethical to the core without believing in any creed ; who are religious without religion .

		No , it is not necessary to be a Christian , nor even a believer in any posi - tive religion , to admit that without morality -LRB- by which , it will be perceived , I do not mean the whole traditional code of morals -RRB- the world would be chaos .

		Nietzsche , however , arraigns the whole system as a positive evil , as inimical to the instincts of life .

		The trouble with
Nietzsche	PERSON	's criticisms is that he became so enamored of the one fixed idea that the many must be kept in subjugation in order that the few might be the stronger , freer , nobler , and happier , which idea he expresses by the formula `` pathos of distance , '' that our civilization which tends to diffuse light and warmth , freedom and happiness , to strengthen the weak , to free the en - slaved , to enlighten the ignorant , to elevate the low appears from his view point as decadence and degeneration .

		He complains that our civilization and its methods are '' anti-natural . ''

		Of course they are .

		Civilization and naturalness are neces - sarily contradictory terms .

		But to return to natur - alness would be to efface history , to retrace our steps to the cradle of the human family not that cradle which is supposed to have stood in Paradise , but the one to which
Darwin	ORGANIZATION	refers ; to become cannibals or beasts of prey .

		This is certainly not
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's ideal .

		If not , why thunder against `` anti-naturalness '' ?

		Has
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's ingenious , brilliant , and original attempt to arrest the victorious course of socialism , to resist the powerful onslaught of the masses in their fight for economic and social equality , any chance of success ?

		I think not .

		His aristocratic theory , the principles of his '' beyond morality , '' run directly counter to the ethical evolution of man - kind for millenniums .

		This evolution clearly tends to increase constantly the circle of those who are permitted to participate in the blessings of civiliza - tion , the advantages of education , the opportunities of free government .

		The wheel of history runs with irresistible force in the direction of uplifting the masses .

		Its course can not be stopped even by the extraordinary power and genius of a
Nietzsche	LOCATION	, for it is propelled by that mightiest of all forces ^ '

		222 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, JAMES MARTJNEATJ : A STUDY .

		* No sweeping disparagement of Mr.
Jack	PERSON	- son 's learned and thoughtful life of
James Martineau	PERSON	is intended when we say that the general reader is likely to find it lacking in the order of facts which , since
Boswell	PERSON	, have formed the recognized staple of biography .

		Dr.
Martineau	PERSON	certainly was not the ideal quarry for a
Boswell	ORGANIZATION	.

		He seems to have led , so far as is humanly possible , the purely intel - lectual life , and his memory is not of the sort about which anecdotes naturally cluster .

		Still , we think that the portrait drawn by Mr.
Jack	PERSON	- son is unduly deficient in warmth and color , and that had he shown us more of Dr. Mar - tineau as Dr.
Martineau	PERSON	showed himself to those who knew him familiarly in life , he would have produced a more life-like as well as a more attractive picture .

		In fact , the impres - sion one gets of Dr.
Martineau	PERSON	from Mr.
Jack	PERSON	- son 's -LRB- in point of ordinary biographical detail -RRB- somewhat lean and unsatisfying pages suggests
Heine	PERSON	's description of
Mme. de Stael	ORGANIZATION	's con - ception of the Germans a race of men , that is to say , '' without livers , mere animated pieces of virtue wandering over snowfields , and dis - coursing of naught but morals and philosophy . ''

		Even in that section of his book which is pro- fessedly devoted to the portrayal of Dr. Mar - tineau '' The Man , '' it is rather mainly as the austere exemplar of high moral and intellectual living that Mr.
Jackson	PERSON	elects to consider his hero ; and this , he thinks , should '' suffice '' for his readers . ''

		Of the quiet hours spent with him , '' he disappointingly assumes , '' I need not tell . '' ''

		Suffice that they fixed in my mind the impression of a sage , a hero , and a saint ; of one who might con - verse with
Plato	ORGANIZATION	, and dare with Luther , and revere with Tauler ; an habitue of the
Academy	ORGANIZATION	, who thrilled to the
Categorical Imperative	ORGANIZATION	, and who knelt at the Cross . ''

		To the Kantian inquirer it will be pleasant and significant to learn that Dr.
Martineau	PERSON	was at once a Christian , and to some extent a walker in the '' olive grove of
Academe	LOCATION	, '' and that he could also '' thrill to the Categorical Impera - tive '' ; but we suspect the plain reader , who seeks in biography mainly the portrait of a man , will sigh for something more concrete and *

		definite than is to be found in these scholastic flights of Mr.
Jackson	PERSON	's .

		Simplicity of style is a merit which Mr.
Jackson	PERSON	seems at times to consciously avoid , especially in that section of his book where it ought to be cultivated .

		For instance , after telling us in plain English that Dr.
Martineau	PERSON	was in figure a '' spare '' man , he carefully adds , `` Of adipose tissue he had no superfluity '' ; while the birth of a child is thus chronicled : '' Anon another came to bless them , a baby
Helen	PERSON	, an angel visitant that stayed not long . ''

		But whatever may be Mr.
Jackson	PERSON	's short - comings as a narrator of simple events , and as a biographer in the usual and we think the proper sense of the term , there can hardly be a question as to his signal merits as a critical though in general acquiescent and admiring expositor of Dr.
Martineau	PERSON	's philosophico - religious creed and teaching .

		As an exposi - tion , therefore , of Dr.
Martineau	PERSON	's teaching , and as an account of the progressive steps by which the force of that teaching was borne in upon a mind not altogether inclined to accept it as true in its entirety , Mr.
Jackson	PERSON	's book must be pronounced a most satisfying and nu - tritive one .

		Mr.
Jackson	PERSON	's original plan , in preparing the volume , was to present a simple account of Dr.
Martineau	PERSON	's life , to be followed by an analysis of his doctrines . ''

		As I medi - tated , however , '' he says , '' the thought occurred to me that I might make the volume not only an account of Dr.
Martineau	PERSON	, but also an utter - ance of my own mind ; and these two aims have ruled my labor . ''

		After briefly outlining the general course of his own gradual conver - sion to the opinions of his master , Mr.
Jackson	PERSON	adds , '' Thus have I toiled on , as serenely sat - isfied with Dr.
Martineau	PERSON	as was
John Fiske	PERSON	with
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	when he wrote the elo - quent volumes of his Cosmic Philosophy . ''


James Martineau	PERSON	came of French Huguenot stock , his refugee ancestor being
Gaston Mar	PERSON	- tineau of Bergerac , who came to
England	LOCATION	after the revocation of the
Edict of Nantes	ORGANIZATION	, and settled at
Norwich	LOCATION	, where he practiced as a surgeon .

		It was at
Norwich	LOCATION	that
James Mar	PERSON	- tineau was born , on
April 21 , 1805	DATE	.

		From eight to fourteen years of age he attended the
Norwich	LOCATION	grammar school , whence he was trans - ferred , at the instance of his sister
Harriet	PERSON	, to a boarding school at
Bristol	LOCATION	, then under the head-mastership of Dr.
Lant Carpenter	PERSON	, whose influence upon his rarely promising pupil proved to be as abiding as it was wholesome .

		THE DIAL 223 Dr.
Martineau	PERSON	's ,
James Kenrick	PERSON	and
Charles Wellbeloved	PERSON	, Mr.
Jackson	PERSON	bestows some appre - ciative pages .

		After two years at
Bristol	LOCATION	Dr.
Martineau	PERSON	studied mechanical engineering in the works of Mr.
Fox	PERSON	, of Derby ; but a year spent in this not altogether congenial pursuit sufficed ; and he announced his desire to enter the ministry , much to the disappointment of his father , who saw in the change the surren - der of a calling that ensured a comfortable livelihood for one which , outside the Establish - ment , meant comparative poverty .

		The son 's wish prevailed , however , and Dr.
Martineau	PERSON	accordingly entered
Manchester College	ORGANIZATION	, then at
York	LOCATION	, a school of liberal divinity , which had at the period of Dr.
Martineau	PERSON	's under - graduateship already accomplished the tran - sition to the older type of Unitarianism .

		Later on , says Mr.
Jackson	PERSON	, it took on Unit - arianism of the more modern type , which anon under
Martineau	PERSON	it further unfolded , and now under
Drummond	ORGANIZATION	reflects its fullest develop - ment .

		The course at
Manchester College	ORGANIZATION	was five years ; and these for
James Martineau	PERSON	were years of intense application or , as
John Kenrick	PERSON	put it , of '' intemperate study . ''

		He worked by a theory which he thus stated in later years : '' I remember thinking that the use of education was to correct the weakness of nature , rather than to develop its strength , which would take care of itself ; and so I gave double time to whatever I disliked , and reserved my favorite studies for spare moments of comparatively tired will . ''

		In
1827	DATE	, at the age of twenty-two , Mar - tineau completed his college course , and was '' admitted to preach . ''

		In
1828	DATE	he was for - mally ordained , according to the Presbyterian usage .

		Dr.
Martineau	PERSON	's early Presbyterian - ism was , however , as Mr.
Jackson	PERSON	carefully points out , English , not Scotch , a material distinction , as the American must be reminded . ''

		In
America	LOCATION	the name Presbyterian suggests
John Knox	PERSON	and the
Assembly	ORGANIZATION	's Catechism ; while in
England	LOCATION	for
the last three hundred years	DATE	there has been a Pres - byterianism that writes its history from the days of
Baxter	LOCATION	, whose broad and tolerant spirit it has reflected .

		A ruling principle with it has been , that there shall be no binding dogma ... Indeed it is the antecedent of English Unitarianism ; and a large number of the Uni - tarian churches in
England	LOCATION	to-day , and nearly all those of
Ireland	LOCATION	, are Presbyterian in their history ... The church , then , that ordained Mr.
Martineau	PERSON	, stood for the heresy of the day . ''

		After a year of schoolmastering and preach - ing at
Bristol Martineau	LOCATION	was called to the co-pastoral office at the Eustace Street Pres - byterian Church in
Dublin	LOCATION	, his colleague and the senior incumbent being Dr.
Taylor	PERSON	, for - merly of
Norwich	LOCATION	.

		The settlement was a pleasant one , with a sufficient income , and a demand upon his time and strength not excess - ive .

		In addition to taking pupils in
Hebrew	LOCATION	and the higher mathematics , Dr.
Martineau	PERSON	was enabled to compile a new hymn-book for his church , which was sorely needed , and which was published in
1831	DATE	.

		A sermon on '' Peace in Division , '' printed in
1830	DATE	, seems to have been the earliest of his published works .

		On the death of Dr.
Taylor	PERSON	, Mr.
Martineau	PERSON	came , or might have come , had he chosen to do so , by succession to his place .

		But here an insu - perable obstacle -LRB- insuperable to the morally high-strung
Martineau	PERSON	, that is -RRB- presented itself , in the extraordinary form of an un - expected increase of salary .

		This increase of X100 .

		proved on examination to be a share of ancient Regium Donum , latterly a parliamen - tary grant , but originally a royal bounty be - stowed by
Charles I.	PERSON	upon the Presbyterians of
Ireland	LOCATION	to secure their loyalty , and thus in the nature of a bribe .

		Many good men had received it unquestioningly , making , perhaps , no nice scrutiny into its origin , or into its essential character .

		But to the fine sense of Mr.
Martineau	PERSON	the taint of bribery clung to it still ; and there were , besides , other reasons why a decidedly scrupulous man must reject it .

		In the first place the Bounty was a '' religious monopoly '' it was a sum received from the taxation of all , but diverted to the benefit of a few .

		`` The people gave ; only Presbyterians received .

		Quakers , Free-Thinkers , Catholics , were taxed with the rest , and for the support of a worship in which they did not participate and with which they had no sympathy .

		Were the question brought to those who pay this fund whether they would subscribe for the mainte - nance of Presbyterian worship , there could be no doubt of their refusal .

		It was not , therefore , a ' free-will offering , ' but an exaction upon reluctant consciences . ''

		In the second place ,
Martineau	PERSON	conceived that his acceptance from the State of a stipend for which he did no service to the
State	ORGANIZATION	was equivalent to the holding of a sinecure either that , or , were he , in his sacerdotal character , to earn the Bounty by doing service for it , a secularization of his office to which he could not be a party .

		Thirdly ,
State	ORGANIZATION	remun - eration seemed to him a bar to the progress of religious thought , for it created an obliga - tion , direct or implied , which must act as a check on the free utterance of opinion .

		Fourthly ,
State	ORGANIZATION	support of religion he held to be injurious to the '' credit and influence of Christianity . ''

		It will be suspected that you 224 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, '' hold for pay the faith you are paid merely for holding . ''

		In fine , Dr.
Martineau	PERSON	concluded that one of two things must be : either the church must give up the Bounty , or else he and the church must part company .

		The first alternative was voted on by the congre - gation , and Dr.
Martineau	PERSON	's party was defeated by one vote .

		From
Dublin	LOCATION	Dr.
Martineau	PERSON	passed to the ministry of the
Paradise Street Chapel	ORGANIZATION	at
Liverpool	LOCATION	, of which church he became sole pastor in
1835	DATE	.

		In
1836	DATE	appeared his first original book , '' The Rationale of Religious Inquiry '' ; and in
1839	DATE	he was the leading champion of Unitarianism in the celebrated * ' Liverpool Controversy '' a spirited theo - logical battle royal which greatly delighted the contest-loving public , and of which Mr.
Jackson	PERSON	gives an entertaining account .

		Dr.
Martineau	PERSON	and his colleagues seem to have carried rather too many guns for their Anglican opponents , who drew away at the close of the combat in a badly riddled and demoralized , if not exactly sinking condition .

		In
1840	DATE	came Dr.
Martiueau	PERSON	's appointment as Professor of Mental and
Moral Philosophy and Political Economy	ORGANIZATION	in Manchester New `` College an event which '' determined his life to Philosophy conjointly with Theology . ''

		His introductory lecture contained the follow - ing passage , which seems especially worth quoting in a day when '' Anglo-Saxonism '' is widely proclaimed as the final and choicer ex - pression of civilization , which may be propa - gated even with the sword . ''

		Complaints are often made of the uncertain and shadowy results from all speculative science : and certainly it will construct no docks ; lay no railways ; weave no cotton ; and , if civilization is to be measured exclusively by the scale and grandeur of its material elements , we can claim for our subject no large oper - ation on human improvement .

		To use the words of Novalis , ... ' Philosophy can bake no bread ; but it can procure for us God , freedom , and immortality . '

		... What periods could be least well spared from the progress of civilization ?

		Surely , the golden ages of philosophy in
Greece	LOCATION	, and its revival in modern
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and
Germany	LOCATION	.

		What are the names , whose loss from the annals of our race would introduce the most terrible and dreary changes in its subsequent advance ?

		Those of Plato and Aristotle in the ancient world ; of
Bacon	LOCATION	,
Locke	PERSON	, and
Kant	PERSON	in more recent times : and it is surely easier to conceive what we should have been without Homer , that without Socrates . ''

		In
1848	DATE	Dr.
Martineau	PERSON	went to
Germany	LOCATION	, where he remained fifteen months , studying , mainly under Trendelenburg , logic and the history of philosophy , which led to Greek philosophical studies , the effect of which was , as he said , '' a new intellectual birth . ''

		Ger - man Philosophy was of course not neglected at its fount .

		Mr.
Jackson	PERSON	concludes : '' The effect of these studies , however , was something more than enlarged knowledge ; from their influence the deflection from the Necessarian view which Mill had detected reached to conscious and complete repu - diation .

		He was converted to that spiritual philosophy of which through all his toilsome life he was to be a fervid apostle . ''


Manchester New College	ORGANIZATION	was moved to Lon - don in
1853	DATE	; and in
1857	DATE	Dr.
Martiueau	PERSON	, resigning from his Liverpool pastorate , went to the metropolis to give his whole time to the College .

		It was not until
1872	DATE	, however , that he finally laid down his pulpit burden , by re - signing his office at
Little Portland	LOCATION	Street Chapel that modest , slimly-attended , ill-fur - nished little tabernacle where , said Sir
Charles Lyell	PERSON	bitterly , ''
England	LOCATION	hid her greatest preacher . ''

		In
1866	DATE	Dr.
Martineau	PERSON	was the centre of a heated controversy , the occasion of which was his nomination to the chair of
Logic and Mental Philosophy in University College	ORGANIZATION	.

		The pro- fessorial body were as a unit in his favor ; but in the
Council	ORGANIZATION	bitter opposition was encoun - tered , led by
George Grote	PERSON	.

		Of Dr.
Marti	PERSON	- neau 's fitness in point of attainments there was of course no question ; but the College was a secular foundation , and Dr.
Martineau	PERSON	was a theologian , which was sufficient to prompt the hostility of Mr.
Grote	PERSON	.

		He was , moreover , a Unitarian ; and this was sufficient to determine the opposition of a section of the
Council	ORGANIZATION	who might perhaps have brooked a theologian had his divinity been of the orthodox stripe .

		The vote on the issue was a tie , and the chairman decided against Dr.
Martineau	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Jackson	PERSON	's version of the story of the estrangement between Dr.
Martineau	PERSON	and his sister
Harriet	PERSON	is interesting , and goes to show that the alienation was all on one side on the side , that is , of the brilliant and warm-hearted , if somewhat mutable and impetuous sister .

		Mr.
Jackson	PERSON	has brought to his task special qualifications for it , and it was undertaken by him , we believe , with the warm approval of Dr.
Martineau	PERSON	.

		His book is primarily one of scholarship and exposition ; but it is full of the traces of an independent and inquiring mind .

		As a Boswellian portrait it might well , we repeat , have been fuller .

		As a study of Dr.
Martineau	PERSON	the religious teacher and the philosopher of religion it leaves little to be de - sired .

		The volume is well made , and contains a fine portrait of Dr.

		Consciously or unconsciously , '' he tells us in his Psychology , `` philosophic speculation always works with psychological elements . ''

		And if this makes it helpful to a psychologist to have studied the history of philosophy , it makes it indispensable to the historian of phil - osophy that he should be a psychologist .

		On the historical side , Professor
Hoffding	PERSON	has prepared himself for his task by numerous studies published during the past thirty years , including monographs on Montaigne ,
Spinoza	ORGANIZATION	, and
Kant	PERSON	.

		Lastly , pending the improbable advent of an English history of Philosophy , it is for us a distinct recommendation that Professor Hoffding is a
Dane	PERSON	, open to influ - ences from
London	LOCATION	as well as from
Berlin	LOCATION	, and so prepared to preserve a juster perspec - tive in the presentation of English and Ger - man thought than we find in the

Windelbands	LOCATION	, and the Falckenbergs , on whom we have been com - pelled to rely .

		nition not only of
Eighteenth century	DATE	but of
Nineteenth	ORGANIZATION	century English thought .

		Here at last Fichte ,
Schelling	PERSON	, and
Hegel	PERSON	are reduced to something like their true proportions , and receive considerably less space than that as - signed to Mill ,
Darwin	PERSON	, and
Spencer	PERSON	.

		It would be unreasonable to demand more , and regret that Professor Hoffding could not emancipate himself from the Kantian superstition , that last infirmity of the philosophic mind .

		For another generation at least , scholars will con - tinue to represent the '' Critique of Pure
Rea	PERSON	- son '' as an epoch-making achievement , while deploring its artificial schematism , repudiat - ing its most characteristic distinctions and classifications , rejecting most of its distinc - tive doctrines , and pinching into pilulous ex - iguity the slight residuum of psychological truth .

		The history of modern philosophy has been written so often during the past sixty years that the story has become conventionalized .

		The transition from medievalism to the Re - naissance , the Italian forerunners of
Bacon	ORGANIZATION	and
Descartes	LOCATION	,
Cartesianism	PERSON	, and the other great constructive systems of the
Seventeenth century	DATE	, the critical and psychological school of English thought from
Bacon	ORGANIZATION	and Hobbes to
Locke	PERSON	and
Berkeley	LOCATION	and
Hume	PERSON	, the relation of Kant to the problems which
Hume	PERSON	raised , the speculative post-Kantian systems , and the new scientific positivism of
Nineteenth	ORGANIZATION	century French and English thought , on all these topics very much the same things are said with slightly varying emphasis and coordina - tion in all of the chief histories now before the public .

		Professor
Hbffding	PERSON	's distinctive merit is that he is throughout intelligible and sane .

		He is .

		by no means lacking in sympathy and appre - ciation for modes of thought opposed to hi * own .

		But he writes consistently from the point of view and in the terminology of a scientific thinker and psychologist of to-day .

		He thus escapes the sheer '' clotted nonsense '' '' that results in some histories of philosophy from the partial and inconsistent adoption of the terminology of the system under discussion , or from the blending of that terminology with the language of some one of the modern post - Kantian systems of
Germany	LOCATION	.

		This may sometimes be a defect in the eyes of the pro- fessional student , who will learn more of the technique and the architecture of some of the great systems from
Ueberweg	LOCATION	or
Erdmann	PERSON	.

		But it will be a great recommendation to the 226 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, general reader , who wishes to get at the cen - tral thought of Spinoza or
Kant	PERSON	, and who cares nothing for the precise relation of the '' modes '' to the `` attributes , '' or for the me - diating function of the transcendental sche - mata .

		Before reaching Descartes in the first vol - ume , Professor Hoffding devotes some two hundred pages to the philosophy of the Ren - naissance and the new birth of science .

		In these chapters he treats of the '' discovery of man '' by the humanists and the accompany - ing growth of the ideas of natural law and natural religion , of the new conception of the universe in
Copernicus	LOCATION	and
Bruno	PERSON	, and the new methods of scientific investigation created foy
Kepler	PERSON	and
Galileo	ORGANIZATION	, and with many mis - understandings heralded by the rhetoric of
Bacon	LOCATION	.

		Notable is the emphasis laid on the political speculations of
Machiavelli	ORGANIZATION	and the psychology of the great humanist
Vives	PERSON	.

		In - deed , one of the chief merits of the work is the attention paid throughout to the progress of psychological analysis and the ethico-politi - cal theory of the state .

		The long chapter on
Giordano Bruno	PERSON	is evidently a labor of love .

		Bacon , as is the fashion of the day , receives something less than justice .

		The chapters on the new conception of the world are introduced by a clear account of the Aristotelio-Media3val world * scheme .

		This is well as far as it goes .

		But the sharp contrast thus presented between the least valid part of the philosophy of Aristotle and the most brilliant achievement of the new science leaves an entirely exaggerated impression of the originality and independence of the fifteenth and sixteenth century thinkers .

		To prepare for a correct estimate in this matter , the his - tory of modern philosophy should be prefaced by similar resumes of the Aristotelian psychol - ogy , of the ethico-political philosophy of Plato 's Republic '' and Aristotle 's '' Politics , '' of the Stoic and Epicurean ethical and religious polemic as presented in
Cicero	LOCATION	, of every - thing , in short , which the great humanists took over from the philosophy of antiquity .

		Hoffding frequently discusses the claims of
Galileo	ORGANIZATION	,
Hobbes	LOCATION	,
Gassendi	PERSON	, and
Descartes	LOCATION	to Apriority in ideas or problems which must have ` been the common possession of all scholars who had read the de
Anima	LOCATION	,
Lucretius	PERSON	,
Plato	ORGANIZATION	, and
Diogenes Laertius	PERSON	.

		The chapter on Gas - sendi would have been a convenient place for such a treatment as we miss of the contribu - tion of ancient atomism to modern thought .

		This chapter is strangely inadequate .

		Hoffding does not , like
Erdmann	PERSON	, in lofty superiority to the chronology , exclude Gassendi from the list of modern philosophers .

		He assigns him a chapter by the side of
Descartes	LOCATION	.

		But it consists of two pages , while
Descartes	LOCATION	receives forty .

		Yet , unless we are to hold that history makes no mistakes , and that the value of a philosopher is precisely proportional to the figure he has made in the history of letters , it is certain that Gassendi deserves no less con - sideration from the thoughtful historian than
Descartes	LOCATION	.

		He was right , and
Descartes	PERSON	was wrong , on nearly every question with regard to which they differed .

		He states more clearly than
Descartes	LOCATION	many ideas for which
Descartes	ORGANIZATION	and Hobbes are praised by
Huxley	LOCATION	and Hoffding .

		And his penetrating criticism com - pletely overthrew the speculative house of cards which Descartes erected to divert the attention of the church , and which is his chief claim to a place in the history of philosophy .

		But
Gassendi	PERSON	's work is hidden away in ponderous Latin tomes , while Des - cartes ' '' Discourse of Method '' caught and kept the ear of the public , and his cleverly advertised system , by the very transparency of the artifices of its construction , provoked and facilitated the logomachies which gave it notoriety .

		It may be observed , in passing , that the statement for which no authority is given , that
Gassendi	PERSON	attributed sentiency to the atoms , is apparently based on the first edition of
Lange	ORGANIZATION	's `` History of Mate - rialism . ''

		In the second edition
Lange	PERSON	with - drew it .

		Professor Hoffding gives an excellent untech - nical description of the great seventeenth cen - tury systems of
Descartes	LOCATION	,
Spinoza	ORGANIZATION	, and
Leib	PERSON	- nitz , whom he evidently admires more than any other group of speculative thinkers .

		That is a matter of taste .

		They do gratify the common - place metaphysical instinct for ingenious sys - tem building , and
Spinoza	ORGANIZATION	in addition to this appeals strongly to some minds on the ethical and religious side by his peculiar '' blend '' of mathematical austerity with cosmic emotion .

		But apart from the specific scientific achieve - ments of Descartes and
Leibnitz	PERSON	, the seven - teenth century systems are worth to us pre - cisely what they may contain of sound psycho - logical and ethical analysis and no more .

		And it may be a paradox , but it is hardly an exaggeration to say that they might all be eliminated without seriously affecting the prog - ress of genuine philosophic thought through
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL Hobbes ,
Locke	PERSON	,
Berkeley	LOCATION	,
Hume	PERSON	, and their nineteenth century successors .

		What engages the attention and arouses the enthusiasm of the student here is precisely what impressed
Cicero	PERSON	in the artificial constructions of the Stoics the ingenuity of the terminology , '' the admir - able coherence and consecution of ideas , the correspondence of beginning , middle , and end . ''

		The Stoic system and terminology dominated in the literary world for five centuries .

		But it was embodied in no book that the world would not willingly let die , and now it survives merely as the memory of a mood , a temper in the reception of experience on the part of its later nominal Roman disciples .

		And such will be the fate of all systems of philosophy as such .

		It is the great book that lives , not the ingen - ious system .

		Professor Hbffding 's admiration for the Cartesians does not prevent his doing ample justice to the English and French thought of the eighteenth century .

		The long chapter on
Rousseau	PERSON	shows how far he is from identifying philosophy with metaphysical system building .

		For the great post-Kantian constructive sys - tems , he evidently feels an imperfect sympathy partly , perhaps , because he holds that there is no excuse for further dogmatizing about the Absolute after
Kant	PERSON	.

		Fichte ,
Schelling	PERSON	, and
Hegel	PERSON	, I cheerfully abandon to him .

		But I must protest against his treatment of
Schopen	PERSON	- hauer , though it is fairer than that found in the ordinary history of philosophy .

		Professor Hoffding here forgets the principle laid down in his preface , that an inconsequence in a great thinker is often nothing but the natural conse - quence of the fact , that his genius displays itself in several lines of thought .

		Schopen - hauer was only thirty years old when he wrote Die Welt als
Wille	PERSON	; and the example of Fichte ,
Schelling	PERSON	, and
Hegel	PERSON	made it inevitable that the ambitious young man should throw his own ideas into the form of a systematic construction .

		A good dialectician can drive a coach-and-four through the system ; but the book is none the less a masterpiece of literary architectonics .

		This framework
Schopenhauer	PERSON	used for the setting of all his subsequent thought and writing .

		But this in no wise detracts from the infinite wealth and suggestiveness of his thought .


M. Brunetiere	PERSON	said ,
several years ago	DATE	, that when the literary account of the century was summed up ,
Schopenhauer	PERSON	would be found to have influenced the higher thought of the age more than any other one philosopher .

		If we leave out of account the body of thought which English readers associate with the names of
Darwin	LOCATION	,
Spencer	PERSON	, and
Huxley	LOCATION	, which can hardly be appropriated to any one thinker , the prediction is in a fair way to be verified .

		There are whole ranges of ideas with regard to the life of the emotions and the will in which we are all disciples of
Schopenhauer	PERSON	.

		And if anything could justify his cynical view of the philosophic guild , it would be their persistent habit of appropriating his essential thoughts while diverting the reader 's attention to the flaws in his character and the external inconsistencies of his system .


Schopenhauer	PERSON	's fame , however , will take care of itself .

		There are fundamentally just two classes of philos - ophers those whom posterity can read , and those whom it can not and will not read .

		He belongs to the first class , whose influence is cumulative , while the others exist only in the histories of philosophy .

		Of the thought of Mill ,
Darwin	PERSON	, and Spen - cer , Professor Hoffding gives an excellent analysis , equally removed from the slavish adhesion of the disciple , and the wilful mis - understanding of the Oxford neo-Kantian who undertakes to demolish the philosophy of evo - lution .

		A short book on modern German philosophy from
1850	DATE	to
1880	DATE	concludes what is , taken all in all , the sanest and most readable
History of Philosophy	ORGANIZATION	yet written .

		The translation of this work is no worse than the average performance in this kind , and seems perhaps better because no process of `` upsetting '' can convert Professor
Hoff	PERSON	- ding 's comparatively short and lucid sentences into the '' pure , definite , and highly finished nonsense '' which results from the attempt to english
Erdmann	PERSON	's account of
Hegel	ORGANIZATION	.

		It presents several baffling mistakes , such as finite '' for final -LRB- Vol .

		I. , p. 231 -RRB- , '' barred the way '' for prepared the way -LRB- p. 473 -RRB- , and the use of spiritualistic -LRB- p. 235 -RRB- .

Oct. 1	DATE	, A DAUGHTER OF THE REIGN OF TERROR .

		* It is not often that the attention of students of the French Revolution is diverted from
Paris	LOCATION	, the great central stage on which that awful tragedy of blood and fire was mainly enacted .

		As early as the end of the seven - teenth century , the great city on the Seine not only dominated the provinces but eclipsed and hid them from view .

		That fine old conception of
Louis XIV.	PERSON	, that he was the
State	ORGANIZATION	, made him jealous of the growing power of his cap - ital , and led him to various attempts to curtail its prosperity ; but the establishment of his court at
Versailles	LOCATION	served to defeat the purpose of the
Grand Monarque	LOCATION	.

		In
1740	DATE
Montesquieu	ORGANIZATION	could say to a friend , ''
France	LOCATION	is nothing but
Paris	LOCATION	and a few distant provinces which
Paris	LOCATION	has not yet had time to swallow '' a saying which the philosophic De Tocqueville , a cen - tury later , pruned down into the epigram , '' At the time of the Fronde ,
Paris	LOCATION	was nothing but the largest French city : in
1789	DATE	it was
France	LOCATION	. ''

		It is hardly surprising , then , that the young readers of Carlyle or Thiers or Guizot should have Parisian dates and names so burned in upon their consciousness as to fancy that there were no days of horror but the Tenth of
August	DATE	, the Second of
September	DATE	, the Twenty - first of
January	DATE	no Jacobins but those of
Paris	LOCATION	no Terror save that of the
Concier	PERSON	- gerie and the
Place de la Revolution	ORGANIZATION	.

		The desolations of
Nantes	LOCATION	,
Toulon	LOCATION	,
Marseilles	LOCATION	,
Lyons	PERSON	,
La Vendee	LOCATION	, are scarce-heard minor plaints in the mighty burden of the central Babylon .

		The narrative now before us , in which
Paris	LOCATION	is hardly mentioned , will help to correct this error in perspective , and to show that these provincial communities , '' over which , '' in
Carlyle	LOCATION	's words , '' History can cast only glances from aloft , '' yet writhed through their full proportionate share of the misery inflicted in the name of Liberty .

		The book is the simple , unaffected story of a young gentlewoman ,
Mdlle	LOCATION	.

		Alexandrine des Echerolles , whose father ,
M. Giraud	PERSON	des Echerolles , had an estate near
Moulins	LOCATION	in the
Nivernais	LOCATION	.

		feeling , and on the verge of revolt against the Convention government in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Alexandrine -LRB- whose mother had happily died before these calamities -RRB- was a gentle child of thirteen , and passionately attached to her aunt , whose heroic and self-sacrificing nature fully deserved all her devotion .

		The young girl was soon matured into a heroine by the forcing process of per - secution .

		Together with her father and aunt , she underwent the suspense and privations of the siege of
Lyons	PERSON	by the revolutionary forces .

		When the city fell -LRB-
October 9 , 1793	DATE	-RRB- , she was carried into another and more dismal circle of the Inferno .

		M. des Echerolles was relent - lessly hunted , only escaping by a series of hairbreadth adventures ; and the beloved aunt was arrested and imprisoned .

		Their poor apartments had been '' sequestrated '' and placed under the charge of a certain Citizen Foret ; and there poor little Alexandrine was left to face the situation as best she might .

		The Terror now began grimly enough in
Lyons	LOCATION	; the guillotine '' went '' as gaily as in
Paris	LOCATION	; and its too-slow work was supplemented by the wholesale Fusillades -LRB- which , curiously enough , Alexandrine does not seem to have noticed -RRB- .

		On the 22d Pluviose , Year II .

February 11 , 1794	DATE	-RRB- , the crushing blow fell ; the guillotine claimed Mdlle .

Heaven	ORGANIZATION	seemed indeed to have deserted her unhappy niece .

		Yet by degrees new friends were found , old friends cautiously reappeared ; and
Alex	PERSON	- andrine found her way back to the home of her childhood , where for a while she was per - mitted to dwell , under pretty close surveillance .

		A temporary revival of the Terror again drove her father into hiding , and imposed fresh in - dignities upon herself .

		She managed to live through them all , and might reasonably have expected a better return from her father for her devotion than the announcement that at the age of seventy-four he was to marry again .

		The prospective bride , who was fifty , was a kindly , sensible woman ; but the blow was a heavy one , and meant once more exile ; so now Alexandrine turned her steps to
Paris	LOCATION	, where a position was found for her as com - panion to an afflicted lady , who in her lucid intervals proved a kind and considerate friend .

Lyons	PERSON	.

		The bulk of the work , therefore , must have been the fruit of later years ' labor .

		An edition , with a preface by

1879	DATE	; and this is the original of the very excellent translation , which now lies before us , by
Marie Clothilde Balfour	PERSON	.

		Originally composed for a small circle of friends , the narrative has the frankness and spontaneity of a journal intime .

		Of art there is none , unless it be the art of concealing art .

		Moralizing is abundant , after the fashion of the times ; and the author 's piety was genuine enough to be a real help in time of need .

		She has no political views to expound ; her interest in her surroundings is entirely domestic ; her eyes throughout are bent upon her appointed task of tracing the thread of the family mis - fortunes through the terribly tangled web of the Reign of Terror .

		Like
Boswell	PERSON	, she has unconsciously made a great book , and her '' ower true tale '' will successfully challenge the output of the modern vein of romantic fiction .

		Mrs. -LRB- or Miss -RRB-
Balfour	PERSON	has given us a spirited translation , preserving in large meas - ure the naivete of the original , and bringing us everywhere face to face with the gentle but resolute and cheerful personality of her author .

		There are some small but perplexing discrep - ancies in dates which should have been ad - justed ; and one slip of this kind is made by the translator herself in a footnote on p. 232 , where she fails to correct the error of the text putting the execution of

		RECENT POETRY .

		* The poetry of the last few months is not remark - able in quantity or in quality .

		Out of perhaps thirty volumes we have selected a dozen that seem to de - serve mention , hut no one of them rises above the level of minor verse , and the best of their contents is derivative .

		The most important of the twelve is '' The Choice of Achilles , and Other Poems , '' by Mr.
Arthur Gray Butler	PERSON	. ''

		Long life and ease , or glory and the grave ? ''

		These are the alternatives between which the hero of the Iliad has to choose , as he debates with him - self whether or not he shall join the Trojan expe - dition . ''

		Oh -LSB- for an oracle To sound above these tortures of the mind .

		And strike their brawling silent !

		Never yet Since deepening manhood darkened first these lips , Bringing the larger choices of the soul , I doubted so before . ''

		When the choice is made , it is voiced in these ring - ing words : '' Gome then !

		Who is for life , let him live here !

		Who is for death and glory , let him go , And mount to heaven , and add a star to fame , Not setting like the sea-washed Pleiades ; Quick to the port !

		Across the crisping waves Our prows point seaward , point the Asian shore : Achilles wakes , is on his way to Troy . '' ''

		The Choice of Achilles '' lies between strenuous conflict and inglorious ease ; '' The Choice of
Heracles	ORGANIZATION	'' lies between sensuous gratification and devoted toil .

		And in the second case , as in the first , the heart `` Thus nobly wooed , with mighty transport filled , Knew its own nobleness , and put forth strength , Like oaks in old
Dodona	ORGANIZATION	, seat of Gods , When mounts the sap in springtime . ''

		So the hero girds himself for his labors , and be - comes the `` helper of the world . ''

		230 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, `` Then forth he fared , calm and resolved , not loud In vaunting , nor with fire of self - applause Deceitful stirred ; but silent , steadfast , calm , Knowing : his old self dead , yet of the new Not certain , more in ignorance than in fear : As when a minstrel takes a harp new strung , And strikes the strings with trembling , lest they make Discordant music , but he finds them true : And then henceforth upon the ears of men Grows a new strain , melodious , liquid , pure , Sweet , ordered , heavenly ,
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's hymn of praise , Like that which kindled first the Orphean lyre ; And still that song , when ended , yet lives on Hid in men 's souls , and , buried for a while , Wells forth anon in music , in some
spring	DATE	, Maytime of hearts ; and , as a call divine , It wakes a singer here , a singer there , Till earth is filled with singing : and the spheres Listen above : -LRB- ' t was thence the wonder came To heal our jars ;-RRB- and from concordant throats Swells up one strain of faultless harmony . ''

		These two noble poems occupy the forefront of Mr.
Butler	PERSON	's volume , and have not a little of the grave cadence of the master who has so evidently inspired them .

		Another classical echo , in a different key , is heard in the lines called '' Sunt Lacrym . '' ''

		But song more sweet shall never twine The rue and rose in one short line ; Or more pathetic give to grief An outlet , for a moment brief , To loose awhile the captive woe Whose prisoned drops refuse to flow ; And , like a draught of myrrh in wine , To mix in tears an anodyne ; Than in that world 's epitome , Sad
Virgil	PERSON	's sweet ' Sunt lacrymse . ' ''

		We must find space for one more illustration of Mr.
Butler	PERSON	's finished and tender-hearted verse , and it is found in what is easily the gem of the collection , in the faultless lyric called '' Peace . ''

		`` Winds and wild waves in headlong huge commotion Scud , dark with tempest , o'er the
Atlantic	LOCATION	's breast ; While , underneath , few fathoms deep in ocean , Lie peace and rest .

		`` Storms in mid-air , the rack before them sweeping , Hurry and hiss , like demons hate-possessed ; While , over all , white cloudlets pure are sleeping In peace , in rest . ''

		Heart , O wild heart , why in the storm-world ranging , Flit ` st thou thus midway , passion 's slave and jest , When all so near , below , above , unchanging Are heaven , and rest ? ''

		The note of revery , of retrospect tinged with melancholy , is the prevailing note of '' The Living Past and Other Poems , '' by Mr.
Thomas Seton Jevons	PERSON	.

		It is struck clearly enough on the opening page .

		`` And now the lilac blooms ; I pluck a sprig , And in the blossoms find and seem to see Familiar faces that are gone before Gone to return with each returning Spring .

		About the porch the silent ivies cling , And in the distant grove the robins wildly sing ; Cling till the walls are mouldered ; sing till love Of singing bursts those red blood-tinctured throats , And down the twilight breeze the echo , dying , floats .

		Now they are gone , and I alone remain , And all the world 's wild music is in vain , Its speech is sorrow and its song is pain . ''

		The writer does little more than frame variations upon the sentiment of these verses in the subsequent pages .

		It is but a forced resignation that nature wrings from his soul , and his yearning for the van - ished past is still in the poignant stage , has not given place to a calm acceptance of the decrees of fate .

		It is all very touching and very sincere , and its turbulence of emotion has a strange power of impressing itself upon the mood of the reader .

		For the second time , Dr.
Henry van Dyke	PERSON	has gathered a slender sheaf of verses into a book , which he has entitled '' The Toiling of Felix , '' from the principal piece in the collection .

		This poem is a fanciful legend , based upon a text from the `` Logia '' found at Oxyrhynchus , and is just the sort of gentle verse that
Longfellow	LOCATION	might have written upon such a theme .

		Good fisherman that he is , for other capture than souls , the author gives us also a few angling lyrics , from which we take this graceful bit : '' There 's wild azalea on the hill , and roses down the dell , And just one spray of lilac still abloom beside the well ; The columbine adorns the rocks , the laurel buds grow pink , Along the stream white arums gleam , and violets bend to drink . ''

		So alluring a picture as that should entice the lover of nature forth , even if not intent upon killing some - thing . ''

		The River of Dreams '' is the best poem in this volume , and we quote the last of its seven sec - tions : '' The river of dreams runs silently down By a secret way that no man knows ; But the soul lives on while the dream-tide flows Through the gardens bright , or the forests brown ; And I think sometimes that our whole life seems To be more than half made up of dreams , For its changing sights , and its passing shows , And its morning hopes , and its midnight fears , Are left behind with the vanished years .

		Onward , with ceaseless motion .

		The life-stream flows to the ocean , And we follow the tide , awake or asleep , Till we see the dawn on Love 's great deep , When the bar at the harbour-mouth is crossed , And the river of dreams in the sea is lost . '' ''

		This is a practical age and it longs for a prac - tical poet , '' says Mr.
Harry Thurston Peck	PERSON	by way of introduction to the lengthy study in hexameters which comes at the end of `` Greystone and Por - phyry , '' his recently-published volume of verse .

		In pursuance of this suggestion , the poem goes on to discourse of actual life in terms of the most uncom - promising realism . ''

		Ye who seek for applause from a matter-of-fact generation Follow for once and all the curious cult of the Ugly , Turn to the bold-faced jig who , cased in follicular bloomers , Straddles the wind-puffed wheel ; to the nymphs who are - loved by the coster , Smut-faced factory girls with voices husky and raucous .

		Hair soot-sifted , hands black-nailed and roughened and warty These be the poet 's theme . ''

		The satire is grim enough , and is pushed home with a persistent energy that for the moment almost persuades us that all sentiment is sickly and all idealism illusive .

		Luckily , the antidote for this
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 231 cynicism may be found close at hand , in such a poem as '' Love , It Is Night '' too long to quote in full and almost too lovely to mutilate '' Dimmed into dusk the flame-clouds disappear , The homing bird sweeps low in circling flight , And distant bells come faintly to the ear Love , it is night . ''

		Now that the world is hushed in sombre grey , Stand not apart nor shut me from your sight ; One little word is all I have to say Love , it is night . ''

		The note of yearning , of pathetic regret for an irrecoverable past , breathes through this poem , as well as through others in the collection .

		Its ac - cent is less tragic , but not less deep , in such verses as '' Heliotrope , '' which tell how '' the sound of a voice that is still '' yet thrills the soul of the scholar who , for all his fame , has missed the best gift of life . ''

		And he had learned , among his books That held the lore of ages olden , To watch those ever-changing looks , The wistful eyes , the tresses golden , That stirred his pulse with passion 's pain And thrilled his soul with soft desire , And bade fond youth return again , Crowned with its coronet of fire . ''

		We are glad that Mr.
Peck	PERSON	is not the '' practical poet '' of his own imagining ; the strength and ten - derness of most of the pieces here published mark him for an idealist at heart , in spite of the flippancy which he at times affects .

		Dr.
Weir Mitchell	PERSON	's verse is always graceful in diction and scholarly in content , and his latest vol - ume , `` The Wager and Other Poems , '' while it contains nothing particularly impressive , makes a pleasant addition to the long list of his published volumes . ''

		The Wager '' is a dramatic composition in a single act , with a romantic French setting of the seventeenth century .

		Both the blank verse and the interspersed lyrics are admirable .

		The poem which we like best is '' The
Sea Gull	LOCATION	, '' with its bur - den of haunting and melancholy beauty .

		Here are three stanzas : '' Thine is the heritage of simple things , The untasked liberty of sea and air , Some tender yearning for the peopled nest , Thy only freight of care . ''

		Thou hast no forecast of the morrow 's need , No bitter memory of yesterdays ; Nor stirs thy thought that airy sea o'erhead , Nor ocean 's soundless ways .

		`` Thou silent raider of the abounding sea , Intent and resolute , ah , who may guess What primal notes of gladness thou hast lost In this vast loneliness . ''

		The contents of Mr.
Robert Loveman	PERSON	's new '' Book of Verses '' are very simple things indeed .

		His flights rarely exceed a dozen lines at a time , but within that compass he often succeeds in expressing a pretty conceit or a graceful fancy .

		`` Behind the Scenes '' maybe taken as a typical example : '' Behind the scenes the kings and queens Are merely mortals ; Juliet leans , A tired girl , against the screens , Behind the scenes . ''

		The final act is on , and lo !

		The loving heart of Romeo Must crack with misery and woe ; The noble
Paris	LOCATION	, too , shall die , '' And tears spring up in every eye ; Then exit all , while rogue and saint Are scrubbing off the mask of paint , Behind the scenes . ''

		This is magazine verse of modest merit , and de - serves a word of modest praise .

		Mr.
Horace Spencer Fiske	PERSON	is the author of a volume of verses , some of which are merely trivial , while others rise to the dignity of lofty utterance inspired by happily-chosen themes .

		The sonnet form is that in which Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	does his best work , and his sonnets outnumber his other pieces .

		They are for the most part occasional , suggested by works of art or literature . ''

		The Bronze Horses of St.
Mark	PERSON	's '' may be taken as a characteristic example . ''

		Triumphal horses that so long ago Beside the
Bosphorus	LOCATION	their chariot drew Till that blind victor doge their beauty knew , And snatched from out the city 's overthrow : Six centuries of sunset did they glow Fair as Apollo 's horses to the view , When swift adown the westering slopes of blue They flash to drink the night 's deep overflow .

		But splendid war-steeds still the victor 's eye Alluring , they must stand beside the
Seine	LOCATION	, A soldier 's ruthless dream to glorify Until he fell ; and they once more might gain That place of peace within the sunset sky Where pigeons coo the saint 's resplendent fane . ''

		Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	's verse is grouped under several catego - ries . ''

		College Verse , '' '' Chicago Verse , '' '' Son - nets on Sculpture , '' and '' Sonnets on Shakspeare '' are four of the chief sections .

		The volume is enti - tled `` The Ballad of
Manila Bay	LOCATION	and Other Verses , '' but we care less for the titular poem and the accom - panying ballad , '' The Charge of
San Juan	LOCATION	, '' than for most of the other contents .

		If '' of
Roosevelt	PERSON	's Rough Riders the fame grows never old , '' there are some , at least , who wish that it might , in view of subsequent developments .

		And the refrain of the titular ballad gives us pause , for it runs : `` And men by a million hearth-fires shall tell of
Manila Bay How Dewey	LOCATION	swept past the forts at night , And struck the Dons in the flushing light , And for freedom won the day . ''

		If the day only had been won for freedom , as the poet fondly imagined when he wrote these lines !

		But it seems to have been won instead , temporarily at least , for a despotism no more deserving than that which it overthrew .

		America can never take genuine pride in that brilliant achievement as long as it shall seem to have been tainted with un - worthy motives with treachery toward an unsus - picious ally , with the lust of conquest and base commercial greed .

		232 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, Mr.
William P. Trent	PERSON	, in the volume of `` Verses '' that he has recently given to the public , strikes a truer ethical note in his treatment of our unfortu - nate war with
Spain	LOCATION	. ''

		Yet wherefore should the race that hunts thee down Insult thee in thy fall ?

		Merely to seize and wear thy ancient crown Is not the end of all . ''

		Have we acknowledged Wisdom for our queen ?

		Do we possess our minds In joy and faith and love and peace serene ?

		Or do the evil winds 1 ' Of passion beat upon our foreheads now As erst on thine , O
Spain	LOCATION	?

		Shall we before no gilded idol bow ?

		Shall we secure remain `` From ignorance and cruelty and lust Of splendor and of power ?

		God , in whom alone is perfect trust , What clouds are these that lower ?

		Mr.
Trent	PERSON	's verses are in many respects highly satisfactory .

		While they are not all that we could wish them to he in technical craftmanship , they are the expression of a finely-cultured and an essentially poetic mind , always aiming at high ideals , and often finding just the words that are needed by the thought .

		Of the longer poems with which the col - lection begins , '' Sataspes , '' suggested by a passage in
Herodotus	ORGANIZATION	, is one of the best , but it would be still better if the author had given himself more room .

		``
Corydon	LOCATION	, '' which is an elegy upon the death of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, is a noble poem , and we wish that we had space for more than the closing stanza : '' But thee , O
Corydon	LOCATION	, shall the gracious light Cheer not on earth , and if , as thou didst sing , Man 's life is bounded by oblivion 's night , Thou hast the dark forever .

		Not the
spring Rising from winter	DATE	's grave to thee could bring Authentic tidings of a world that lies Beyond the shadows that dark planets fling On this low earth of ours .

		Art thon more wise , O master , now , and hast thon seen it with thine eyes ? ' '

		It is rather noteworthy that the two finest elegiac tributes to Arnold should have come from Amer - ica , but we have seen no others that equal this by Mr.
Trent	PERSON	and Mr.
Carman	PERSON	's '' Death in
April	DATE	. ''

		Mr.
Trent	PERSON	's '' Souvenirs of Travel '' include several charming compositions , among which ''
Assisi	LOCATION	'' is probably the best . ''

		Thou little town amid the Umbrian hills , Methinks thou liest in shadows all the day Some ghostly ' !

		presence , is it not , that fills Thy narrow streets and crumbling houses gray ? '' ''

		Ah yes !

		his saintly shade that long ago Loved nature through and through from man to clod Then what to thee the noontide 's flaunting glow ,
Assisi	LOCATION	, where St.
Francis	PERSON	walked with God ? ''

		Mr.
Trent	PERSON	writes excellent sonnets , and some of them will be remembered by readers of THE DIAL , for they made their first appearance in our pages If we must make a choice among them , it shall be '' The Isles of Rest . '' ''

		Ah me !

		the pity of this great world 's past , The causes lost , the sighs , the fallen tears , The slow , blind rolling of the heavy years .

		And all the dark unmeaning shadows cast !

		Canst thou not see the sad procession vast Of them that strove with fortune mighty peers , Bearing their crowns or scrolls or harps or spears Only to lay them down and die at last ?

		J '' Peace , fool , behold that calm sea on whose breast The souls of them that fought at Troy of old Were wafted till they reached the Isles of Rest That lifted from the waves their sands of gold , Whence sprung the palms beneath whose shade the Blest Of earthly lives serene the story told . '' ''

		A Garland of Sonnets , '' by Mr.
Craven Lang	PERSON	- stroth
Betts	PERSON	, consists of thirty-three tributes to as many poets , couched in terms of conventional praise , but revealing little insight , and not in any way remarkable for felicity of expression .


William Morris	PERSON	is thus apostrophized , and the sonnet fairly represents the average quality of the collection : ''
Chaucer	PERSON	and
Spencer	PERSON	, gather him to your heart , The burly Radical of dreamy rhyme !

		And crown him with the
Trouvere	ORGANIZATION	's bay sublime , That ne'er till now had graced the British mart ; For even to him the story-teller 's art Came glamorous out of Fancy 's buoyant clime , The mintage of that golden ore of time From the world 's childhood ; for he voiced in part Your mid-sea swaying melodies , the breath Of pastoral lands , of flowry meads , and meres , And your pale , poignant picturing of death , And your dear , tender ruth for love in tears .

		No idle singer he , whate'er he saith ; His pilgrim torch relumes the shadowed years ! ''

		Mr.
Edward Robeson Taylor	PERSON	, in his `` Moods and Other Verses , '' has also inscribed sonnets to a great many poets , among them the French poet of '' Les Trophies , '' whose own sonnets he has trans - lated into English .

		Here are the lines devoted to M. de He 're ` dia : '' 'T was eagle-winged , imperial
Pindar	PERSON	, who Sent down the ages on the tide of song The thought that only to the years belong Those deeds that win immortal poets ' due .

		Still rise his crowned athletes to the new , On his unwearied pinions borne along ; Still shepherds ' pipe and lay sound sweet and strong As when Theocritus attuned them true .

		And so through thee , the feats of heroes great , The hues of life of other times than ours , With such refulgence in thy sonnets glow .

		That in the splendor of their new estate , They there , with deathless Art 's supernal powers , Shall o'er the centuries enchantments throw . ''

		It is impossible to find anything to praise in such verse as this .

		It is commonplace in ornament and wooden in resonance .

		Yet it is as good verse as we can find in the two hundred varied pages of Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	's volume .

		There is some lovely verse in `` The Search of
Ceres	LOCATION	, and Other Poems , '' by Mrs.
Sarah Warner Brooks	PERSON	.

		The writer has an old-fashioned way of saying things simply and effectively , and her tech - nique is for the most part admirable , although the ear is now and then vexed by a redundant line . ''

		Foretold '' is a short poem in which the writer 's powers are exhibited at their best :

		THE DIAL 233 44 How went with thee , dear heart , the laggard years unblest Ere we two met ?

		Alack !

		no skill have I to see .

		I can but know , sweet , that -LRB- their prescience guessed -RRB- All my life 's days were then but prophecies of thee .

		Thy being thrilled my maidenhood from far As winds unseen thrill aspen leaves .

		The sea Sang of thee :
Autumn	DATE	, rustling through her ripened sheaves , Old
Winter	DATE	, drowsing numbly neath his snows ,
Spring	ORGANIZATION	, with blown lilacs , in clear monotone .

		And Summer , drunk with new wine of the rose , Foretold thy advent : and in solemn joy , alone , Yearning , I waited , till my heart beat fast Hearing what way thy love-led footsteps went ; And then I knew that God was good .

		Life flowered at last !

		I looked into thine eyes , belov 'd , and was content . ''

		There are a number of memorial pieces in this volume , of which the best seems to be the irregular sonnet addressed to the memory of
William E. Russell	PERSON	: '' .

		With poised stars his steadfast soul kept pace , And all his life was clean as snows untrod ; For , ever as a flint he set his face For righteousness and duty , truth and Ood !

		Bruised in a Circean herd 's unseemly strife , Like the hurt deer , he sought green shades of rest , Cooling the fevered pulses of his life On the great Mother 's ever-healing breast .

		Then to his couch of dreams , at hush of night , An angel bore sooth poppies , fringed and white : Softly he laid them on his quiet eyes , And , like a lover , kissed away his breath , And dreaming on , he woke in Paradise Immortal !

		And knew not the face of Death ! ''

		- `` The Search of
Ceres	LOCATION	'' is a charming poem , in an original stanzaic form , of which an illustration may be given : '' Night swept her sables through the vale , Above hung
Hesper	PERSON	, calm and pale , In bosky depths a nightingale Her fleeting hushed before my wail , As , crazed with woe , I sought for thee ,
Persephone	LOCATION	, Persephone ! ''

		The queen of the under-world is also taken as the subject of two poems in the ''
Sylva	PERSON	'' of Miss
Elizabeth G. Crane	PERSON	.

		From the first of them , tell - ing of Proserpine 's first return to earth , the fol - lowing verses are taken : '' Before her now the gates of
Tartarus Swung	ORGANIZATION	grudging wide , while every churlish bolt Shrieked out upon her , but she passed up , up , Inhaling through glad nostrils the fresh smell Of genial earth , whose lap with -LSB- new growth teemed ; For all the
spring	DATE	yearned in her blood | till she Broke through the earth with flowers , embraced and fell At golden
Ceres	LOCATION	' feet , and withfquick touch Her winter mourning changed to summer joy . ''

		The writer 's fondness for classical themes is again evinced in the exquisite poem , ``
Marpessa	LOCATION	to Apollo , '' suggested by the masterpiece of Mr.
Stephen Phillips	PERSON	.

		The group of irregular sonnets at the close of the volume provides us with the following extract , in which the writer appears at her best : '' Dost thou remember how a silence fell Between us when beneath the stars we stood ?

		Our light talk dropped , above it , we knew well , Swept ever on love 's strong and silent flood Drawing us each to each , though not one word We spoke of love .

		Pale grew the rosy west , Earth deeply breathed in slumber , ocean heard , With answering murmurs gently her caressed , The flowers sighed softly to the wooing wind , The maiden moon sank in a cloud 's embrace ; When love moved all things , did not nature kind Speak for us both ?

		Thy soul sprang to thy face , Imperious summoned mine to pay love 's debt ; As mine flashed back love 's answer , our lips met . ''

		There is much delicate feeling , and no little of technical mastery , in the little volume that has yielded us the above quotations .

MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Among the '' Stories of the Nations '' S. 8eries -LRB- Ptnam -RRB- unusual interest at - taches at the present moment to the monograph on
Italy	LOCATION	by Professor
Pietro Orsi	PERSON	.

		The author is an Italian scholar of note , a professor of history in
R. Liceo Foscarini	PERSON	,
Venice	LOCATION	, and a keen student of contemporaneous events and conditions .

		His present work , though limited in scope , fur - nishes excellent reading for anyone wishing to profit by an educated Italian 's studies of his country 's history and its future .

		An interesting departure from the commonly accepted point of view lies in the credit given to distinctly literary men , not di - rectly engaged in political affairs , for their efforts in behalf of Italian unity in the first half of the present century .

		In every field of literature men were to be found who gave their best efforts and all their energy to the betterment of political condi - tions in
Italy	LOCATION	.

		These writers held diverse views and were interested in different projects , yet their influence was steadily directed toward increasing among the Italian people the desire for Italian unity under some form .

		Thus the Neo-Guelph party , which would have had
Italy	LOCATION	a federated state with the Pope as president , was founded as the result of the writings of
Vincenzo Gioberti	PERSON	, '' the prophet of the revolution of
1848	DATE	. ''


Sardinia	LOCATION	was urged as the natural and necessary centre of the future state by
Cesare Balbo	PERSON	in his
Speranze D * Italia	ORGANIZATION	.

		Re - publicanism , pure and simple , found its chief exponent , of course , in
Mazzini	LOCATION	, but others less in - tensely political by nature contributed to its pro- gress , as when the actor ,
Gustavo Modena	PERSON	, recited to enthusiastic audiences
Silvio Pellico	PERSON	's Francesca Da
Rimini	LOCATION	.

		The tragedies of
Niccolini	ORGANIZATION	,
Massimo D'Azeglio	PERSON	's
Ultimi Casa Di JRomagna	ORGANIZATION	, deprecating violence but bitterly attacking the papal govern - ment , the works of the patriotic poets ,
Giovanni Berchet	PERSON	and Mercatini , all served to maintain and to increase popular fervor for some form of national unity , and are recognized as constituting an im - portant factor in the development of the modern state .

		After
1859	DATE	the men of action take the front of the stage , and a brief account is given of polit - 234 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, ical changes since that time .

		Political leaders are gently criticised and riotous disturbances deplored , but in these latter the author finds no cause for be - lieving that the Italian people are weary of union , or that the state is about to fall to pieces .

		They are rather caused by economic troubles specifically demanding readjustment by the united govern - ment , not tending to overthrow it .

		Even of the long standing quarrel between Pope and
King	PERSON	, the view is expressed that ultimately the Pope will see his own best interest and yield his untenable posi - tion .

		The author is distinctly a patriot , and whether or not his views are well founded , his patriotism and enthusiasm are refreshing , after the recent lugubrious prophecies by others of the approaching dissolution of
Italy	LOCATION	.

		The translation , by
Mary Alice Vialls	PERSON	, is generally good , though it is mark - edly better for the inspiring utterances of great leaders like
Cavour	PERSON	, or
Mazzini	PERSON	-LRB- the text abounds in quotations -RRB- than for the author 's own writing .

		Of all the '' Heroes of the Nations , '' The story of none is more essentially the centre Richelieu .

		u ^ .

		u of romantic possibilities than the great Cardinal ,
Armand du Plesis de Richelieu	ORGANIZATION	.

		The average reader of this latter day dramatizes him as '' under the red robe , '' drawing round him '' the magic circle of the Church , '' holding midnight conferences with messengers booted and spurred or disguised bravoes in hodden gray : in general , as a relentless spider , who '' thrilled at each touch and lived along the line , '' and gave his enemies the choice between submission and death .

		All this he doubtless was ; but in Mr.
James Breck Perkins	PERSON	's volume on ''
Richelieu	PERSON	and the Growth of the French Power '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- the author has pretty thoroughly stripped off the draperies , and has sought to tell a plain tale plainly the story of the petty provincial Bishop of Luon , who pushed and flattered and intrigued his way to a place at court ; who was more of a priest than an author , more of a soldier than a priest , and was most of all the statesman whose theory of government was absolute monarchy with a minister for monarch .

		Mr.
Perkins	PERSON	writes of his hero with cool candor ; he has apparently no illusions as to any of the amiable virtues being included in
Richelieu	LOCATION	's outfit : and his readers have little choice but to accept his summary of the Car - dinal 's character : '' His intellect though acute was not original , his character though vigorous was not exalted ... He was sagacious in his policy , tire - less in his activity , and remorseless in his animos - ities ... Imperious when he held power , he was obsequious when he sought it : no one flattered the great more adroitly when he was himself a person of small account . ''

		Mr.
Perkins	PERSON	's concluding words on the results of
Richelieu	ORGANIZATION	's policy have a certain timeliness to-day : `` It is desirable that comfort should be generally diffused and that wealth should increase , yet the accumulation of money is not the sole object of national , any more than of individual existence .

		Richelieu had other ideals ; he wished
France	LOCATION	to be the first state of
Europe	LOCATION	, he desired that her boundaries should grow broader , her power grow greater , her influence become larger .

		He wished to shape the form of government so that these ends might be attained , and he accomplished the object which he undertook .

		It is doubtful whether the French people were any happier at the end of
Richelieu	ORGANIZATION	's administration than at its beginning , but beyond question ,
France	LOCATION	was a more powerful state . ''

		The book has the usual attractions and conveniences which we have learned to expect in the volumes of this series : there are twenty-three portraits from authentic sources , maps and plans of
France	LOCATION	and
Paris	LOCATION	, and a sufficient index .

		A dissection of the
Hexaleuch	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first volume of Mr.
W. E. Addis	PERSON	's '' The Documents of the Hexateuch '' appeared
several years ago	DATE	, and now the second , on `` The Deuteronomical Writers and the Priestly Documents '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- presents its re - sults .

		These are the questions asked and answered in its nearly 500 pages : -LRB- 1 -RRB- What was the kernel of the Deuteronomical code as found in
Deuteron	LOCATION	- omy , chapters 12-26 ?

		-LRB- 2 -RRB- What is the character of the historical and introductory chapters -LRB- 1-11 -RRB- to this code ?

		-LRB- 3 -RRB- What chapters were appended to the laws in the strict sense of the word , which en - force its observation partly by promises and threats , and partly explain the way in which it was trans - mitted by Moses to the
Levites	PERSON	?

		-LRB- 4 -RRB- What was the work done by the Deuteronomic school which edited older historical works , and inserted remarks of their own in criticism of past history ?

		The first question is answered -LRB- p. 18 -RRB- by , `` it is not incredible that a dozen hands may have been at work within this narrow compass '' -LRB- chaps .

		12-26 -RRB- .

		The second is decided by , '' they -LRB- chaps .

		1-4 :40 -RRB- are a later ad - dition by a writer of the Deuteronomic school '' -LRB- p. 20 -RRB- ; `` chaps .

		5-11 must also proceed from dif - ferent bands . ''

		To the third question we find the answer , that
Deuteronomy	LOCATION	chap .

		28 is an authentic part of the original book , chap .

		27 is transitional between 26 and 28 , and is composed of old and of new material ; chaps .

		29-30 are by a later writer of the Deuteronomic school ; chaps .

		31-32 are also made * up of material of different dates .

		Briefly , the fourth question is answered by finding traces of the Deuteronomic writer in the decalogue , in the book of the covenant , in
Joshua 1-12	PERSON	, and here and there in Judges and Kings .

		Now , to make all of this plain to the reader , the author has presented these documents in English translation , and in dif - ferent kinds of type to represent the different docu - ments , and has arranged them in the proper order , under appropriate divisions and subdivisions .

		Abun - dant footnotes are used to give quotations from other works , reasons for the position taken , and critical remarks on the text .

		This work displays a vast amount of critical genius , and presents the vanguard of the extreme radical school of analytical criticism of the Hexateuch .

		t u r J for the purpose of swelling the fund consecrated to the needs of the wounded soldiers in the Boer country , is an ingenious and interesting device brought to maturity by members of the scholarly circle connected with
Oxford University	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is the publication of a neat volume comprising upward of a score of brief , unpretending sketches of `` Some Oxford Pets '' -LRB- Oxford :
B. H. Blackwell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Each is by a separate hand and commemorates feelingly the virtues and manners of individuals of the inferior races that have been by chance or choice adopted as housemates and familiar friends .

		Pro- fessor and Mrs.
Max Miiller	PERSON	tell of the endearing traits of a couple of dachshunds that were for years valued companions .

		Mr.
W. Warde Fowler	PERSON	writes the memoir of
Billy	PERSON	, the fox-terrier , who was trained to respect the rights of birds as faithfully as did his master .

		Dr.
Fairbairn	PERSON	declares his abiding affection for two full-blooded terriers who betrayed their noble pedigree in their dignified behavior .

		One contributor relates the story of a brown owl that , completely domesticated , evinced surprising intelligence in a loyal attachment to its owner that lasted through a considerable lifetime .

		Another gives an engaging account of a jerboa , that strange creature of whom
Browning	PERSON	said : '' There are none such as he for a wonder Half bird and half mouse . ''

		A rat , a mouse , a hen , and a chameleon are among the list of humble beings honored with a memorial by loving survivors .

		The sketches possess an in - terest apart from the subjects they treat .

		They reveal the gentle side of the writer , and in every case win us by the kind and just consideration shown to dumb dependents who were thrown upon the mercy of their masters , and were never neglected nor oppressed .

		The historettes were compiled by Mrs.

		The latest in Biology .

		The same high standard of scientific excellence found in previous issues is to be seen in the `` Woods Holl Biological Lectures '' -LRB-
Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- for
1899	DATE	.

		The titles of the sixteen lectures show that the annual volume for the past year is somewhat more varied than usual in its contents and that it contains a large amount that is non-technical for the general reader .

		The lecturers come from the leading uni - versities throughout our country and speak upon themes which are their specialties .

		The book thus affords first-hand information in condensed and usually very readable form upon subjects at present prominent in biological discussion .

		Professor Camp - bell writes of the evolution of the higher plants in the light of cytology , and Professor Penhallow of the evidence which fossil plants reveal of the course of evolution of the vegetable world .

		Professor MacDougal reports upon a new field of investiga - tion , the effect of ascending and descending cur - rents of air upon the distribution of life in moun - tain regions .

		Dr.
Thorndike	PERSON	discusses instinct and the associative processes in animals with experi - mental evidence that controverts some generally accepted views .

		The reactions of minute organisms to various forms of stimuli are summarized by Dr.
Jennings	PERSON	from his recent studies , and an account of the blind fishes of
North America	LOCATION	is given by Pro- fessor
Eigenmann	PERSON	.

		Other lectures treat of neglected factors in evolution , the growth of color in moths and butterflies , the physiology of secretion , and old and new interpretations of regeneration .

		The ap - plication of statistical methods to the problem of variation and the study of race changes is warmly advocated by Professor
Davenport	PERSON	.

		The closing chapter is a brief but most interesting account of Professor
Loeb	PERSON	's startling discovery of the produc - tion of artificial parthenogenesis in the eggs of sea - urchins by the use of chemical solutions .

		But it is rather because of the associations , the '' atmosphere , '' which centuries of classical and literary cultivation within its ancient walls have created , than for any of those curiously barbaric tendencies in the English aristocracy which

United States	LOCATION	can hope to rival .

		In the growing sense of '' shame in dying rich '' which would be so promising a sign in our national life were it less suggestive of mediaeval penitence , the secondary schools have been forgotten ; and more than one whose brief years were filled with hope and promise of almost Etonian usefulness have been permitted to languish and die .

		His more important chapters deal with education , business , politics , and religion , and in the course of them he sets forth with a pleasing lit - erary art the attitude towards life and its problems of a man of fine culture and clear conception of the broader aspects of our relation to environment and to ourselves .

		Mr.
Bowker	PERSON	has nothing strikingly original to offer in his philosophy of life , but the philosophy is so attractive and well rounded out , and the presentation of it has so much of the charm of meditation and personality , that the reader is 236 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, glad to follow it with something more than inter - est. .

		Concluding , he says : `` The thought of Evolu - tion , opposing itself alike to the doctrines of special creation in nature , of revolution in society and government , and of instant ` conversion ' in religion , has become the great light upon God 's universe , which more than any other before given to man , gives us knowledge even of the uses of evil and the great hope of the triumphing of good .

		In this thought , to each of the sons and daughters of men is com - mitted the destiny of Man .

		This is the End of the Arts of Life . ''

		In an age so full of feverish eagerness to drink the wine of life to the lees and wait not we may well be grateful for every such calm survey of the larger possibilities of existence and its finer aspirations , and no one can read Mr.
Bowker	PERSON	's volume without feeling that the atmos - phere of his work-a-day world has been cleared somewhat by the breath of some diviner air blown upon him from the heights .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		The school text-books of to-day are so immeasurably better than those of fifteen or twenty years ago that there are few departments in which anything is left to be desired .

		But the ideal book of English history for school use has been long delayed , and we welcome Mr.
J. N. Larned	PERSON	's `` History of
England	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- as at least a close approach to that ideal .

		We have never seen a better book upon the subject , and should find it difficult to suggest wherein the present work might be improved .

		In style , in choice of illustration , in topical analysis , and in helpful material for the use of teachers , it is a thoroughly admirable production , and should at once find its way into secondary schools everywhere .

		The cosmopolitan scholarship of Signer
Federica Garlanda	PERSON	, the editor of the Italian '' Minerva , '' is at - tested by a number of publications in philology , political science , and literary criticism .

		His latest work -LRB-
Rome	LOCATION	: Laziale -RRB- is entitled ''
Guglielmo Shakespeare	PERSON	, il Poeta e l'Uomo . ''

		It is a careful study of the life and times of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, with a readable account of the most important of the plays , particular attention being given to those having Italian subjects .

		It is full of reverence for the genius of the poet , and exhibits an appreciation of his qualities somewhat deeper and more subtle than we expect from a critic of the Latin race .

		Mr.
David McKay	PERSON	is the publisher of a new edition of an important practical manual by Mr.
Oliver Davie	PERSON	.

		It is entitled '' Methods in the Art of Taxidermy , '' and gives complete expert directions for every process connected with the preparation and stuffing of the skins of animals , including birds , mammals , crustace - ans , fishes , and reptiles .

		The author was engaged upon this work for many years , and it has the benefit of his life-long experience .

		The illustrations consist of nearly a hundred full-page engravings .

		The Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	have revamped the translation , made more than twenty years ago , of
Gaboriau	ORGANIZATION	's most popular novels , and the result is a uniform set of six presentable volumes .

		The set includes '' Monsieur Lecoq '' and its sequel or supplement , '' The Honor of the Name , '' `` File 113 , '' `` The Widow Lerouge , '' '' Other People 's Money , '' and '' The Mystery of Orcival . ''

		NOTES .

		`` Poems from
Shelley	PERSON	and
Keats	PERSON	, '' edited by Mr.
Sidney C. Newson	PERSON	, is a school text recently published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The American Jewish Year Book for
5661	DATE	-LRB-
1900	DATE	-
1901	DATE	-RRB- , edited by Dr.
Cyrus Adler	PERSON	, will be issued at once by the
Jewish Publication Society of America	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dr.
F. D. Allen	PERSON	's edition of the '' Medea '' of Eurip - ides , revised by Dr.
Clifford H. Moore	PERSON	, is among the latest educational publications of
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.


Alice B. Stockham & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers of a small book on `` Tolstoy , '' in two parts , the first of which is the work of Miss
Alice B. Stockham	PERSON	, and the second the work of Mr.
Havelock Ellis	PERSON	. ''

		Bibliomania in the Middle Ages , '' by
F. Somner Merry	ORGANIZATION	weather , is the subject of the next volume to appear in the series of book-lovers ' classics published by
Messrs. Meyer Brothers & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, of
New York	LOCATION	.

		Beginning with the
September	DATE	number , '' Art Educa - tion '' appears in an enlarged and improved form , and hereafter will make its appeal to all who are interested in art matters , whether teachers of the subject or not .

		Mr.
Richard Watson Gilder	PERSON	has reissued his '' Five Books of Song , '' being his complete poetical writings , in an edition which embodies numerous revisions and additions to the earlier text .

		The
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish the volume .

		A single volume contains Parts III .

		and IV .

		of the '' Handbook to Christian and
Ecclesiastical Rome	ORGANIZATION	, '' which has been prepared by Messrs.
M. A. R. Tucker	PERSON	and
Hope Malleson	ORGANIZATION	.

		The work is published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Whence and Whither , '' by Dr.
Paul Carus	PERSON	, is a volume of popular philosophy , being '' an inquiry into the nature of the soul , its origin , and its destiny . ''

		It is issued by the
Open Court Co.	ORGANIZATION	in their '' Religion of Science Library . '' ''

		Places I Have Visited , '' published by Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is one of
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	's biblia a-biblia .

		It is a blank book , in which a traveler may record his im - pressions , and set forth the circumstances of his visit to any particular place .

		White 's ''
Selborne	LOCATION	'' and the ever-delightful '' Travels of Sir
John Mandeville	PERSON	'' are given us as the two latest volumes in the '' Library of English Classics '' published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
A. W. Pollard	PERSON	is , as here - tofore with this series , the editor .

		The
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	send us
Volume III	ORGANIZATION	.

		of Mr.
Evelyn Shuckburgh	PERSON	's translation of '' The Letters of Cicero . ''

		One more volume will complete this undertaking , and provide us with the entire extant correspondence of the great Roman statesman and man of letters .

		The seventh and concluding volume of Professor Bury 's edition of
Gibbon	PERSON	's '' Decline and Fall '' has just been published by the Messrs.
Macmillan	PERSON	.

		An index of nearly two hundred pages , prepared by Mrs.
Bury	PERSON	, appears with this volume , and immeasurably enhances the value of the edition .

		One of the latest we do not venture to say the latest translators of Omar is Professor
F. York Powell	PERSON	, who has tried his hand at a few of the
Rubai	PERSON	- yat .

		His '' XXIV .

		Quatrains from Omar , '' as pub - lished by Mr.
M. F. Mansfield	PERSON	, makes a very pretty little book , but the verse is tame at the best , and we can not understand what could have persuaded any one to compose or to publish it .

		1900 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 237 Part III .

		of Mr.
Evelyn Abbott	PERSON	's `` History of
Greece	LOCATION	, '' now published by Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons , extends from 445 to 403 B. C. ; in other words , from the Thirty Years ' Peace to the Fall of the Thirty at
Athens	LOCATION	.

		It includes some reprinted matter from the author 's '' Perides . ''

		One more volume will com - plete the work .

		The late
Hugh McCulloch	PERSON	's '' Men and Measures of Half a Century , '' which has now for some time been out of print , is reproduced in a new and cheaper edition by the Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	.

		It is well that this should have been done , for the work is one of the most impor - tant memoirs of its period , and is much in demand by students of American history . ''


Ned Myers	PERSON	; or , Life before the Mast , '' has been added by the Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	to their `` Mohawk '' edi - tion of
Cooper	ORGANIZATION	's novels .

		This book , it will be remem - bered , is the one recently discovered , and thought at first to have remained unpublished , although it was afterwards proved to have seen the light .

		It now takes its long vacant place in the library sets of
Cooper	ORGANIZATION	.

		Messrs.
Newson & Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, are the publish - ers of '' A Modern English Grammar , '' by Mr.
Huber Gray Buehler	PERSON	.

		It seems to be a sensible sort of book , free from scholastic rubbish , and thoroughly practical in method .

		It is evidently the work of an experienced and successful teacher of the subject .

		It also speaks well for the new publishing house of which it consti - tutes the first venture .

		Dr.
Raymond M. Alden	PERSON	is the author of a treatise on `` The Art of Debate '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , which will be found highly useful by students who are training for forensic honors .

		The discussion is lucid , and the illustrative material adduced is of the most helpful sort .

		Nor should we neglect to mention the appended list of sub - jects for debate , which will doubtless help many a com - mittee of students to solve the vexatious initial problem of deciding upon the question to be debated .

		The news of the death of
Thomas Davidson	PERSON	, which occurred on the
14th of September	DATE	, will cause wide - spread grief , not only in educational and philosophical circles , but wherever his influence was felt , which means among great numbers of men and women to whom the intellectual life is not so much a professional matter as the highest of general human concerns .

		To many such people , his writings and his lectures came as a quickening influence and a vital inspiration , en - forced by a large and sympathetic personality .

		His books were the least importaut of his points of contact with his fellow-men , and his life was an even finer thing than his published work .

		Born a Scotsman in
1840	DATE	, his footsteps sought one centre of learning after another in
England	LOCATION	and on the Continent , and for his last score or so of years he was a resident of this country .

		His chief studies were in Greek and scholastic philosophy , in the theory of education , in the fine arts , and in the higher reaches of literature .

		He was the interpreter of such men as
Aquinas	LOCATION	,
Bonaventura	LOCATION	,
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, and
Rosmini	ORGANIZATION	.

		He was a vigorous philosophical thinker , with a touch of mysticism , seeming at times a radical , and at others a reactionary .

		His
summer	DATE	school of philosophy in the Adirondacks attracted an - nually a notable company of serious men and women , and exercised a considerable influence over contem - porary thought .

		The fine old ideal of plain living and high thinking was never better exemplified than in the person of this robust and genial scholar , whose loss we now chronicle with unfeigned regret .

		THE SEASON 'S BOOKS FOR THE YOUNG .

		In continuation of our Announcement List of Fall Books , in THE DIAL for
September 16	DATE	, we give the fol - lowing List of Forthcoming Books for the

		273 A CENTURY OF
AMERICAN VERSE	ORGANIZATION	.

		Among the publications of the present year , including those that have already seen the light and those promised for the near future , there is none of greater importance or more perma - nent value to the readers of this country than the '' American Anthology '' with which Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	has crowned his quarter-century 's work for the appreciation and illustration of the English poetry of our modern age .

		In the performance of that work , criticism and selec - tion have gone hand in hand , and the insight which has produced the best systematic valua - tions of our nineteenth century verse has also provided us with what are incomparably the best treasuries into which the finer efflorescence of that verse have been collected .

		We owe Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	a debt of deep gratitude for his loyal devotion to the interests of the poetry of our own time , and for the painstaking industry which , having previously supplemented the '' Victorian Poets '' with a '' Victorian An - thology , '' has in like fashion supplemented the '' Poets of
America	LOCATION	'' with the '' American An - thology '' which is now , after much vexatious delay , placed in our hands .

		In this portly volume of close upon a thou - sand pages we have a representation of the poetical activity of the national period of our history , beginning with the lyrics of Freneau , and ending with the work of certain of our younger men graduates of the last few years for whom a single line constitutes the ap - pended biographical note .

		By actual count , the number of writers whose work receives illustration is five hundred and seventy-one , of all degrees of majority and minority .

		No an - thologist can hope to satisfy all of his critics , and in the present case some fifty or a hun - dred additional names might easily be sug - gested by others than those who bear them as worthy of inclusion ; but this easy sort of fault-finding is no part of our purpose , and we are quite sure that no other hand could have performed Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	's task with equal skill , sympathy , and nice discernment , that no other mind could have been found so richly stored with the knowledge of the subject requisite for the making of such a collection .

		If some small proportion of the contents seem undeserving of the distinction here conferred we shall do well to take heed of the editorial hint that `` humble bits , low in color , have values of juxtaposition , and often bring out to full advantage his more striking material . ''

		And the editor forestalls critics of the carping type by himself quoting
Nathaniel Ward	PERSON	's couplet which might else be quoted against him to the effect that '' Poetry 's a gift wherein but few excel , He doth very ill that doth not passing well . ''

		After much hesitation and tentative experi - ment , Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	determined upon a chrono - logical rather than a classified arrangement for the present volume .

		The Victorian poets '' crystallize into groups , each animated by a master , or made distinct by the fraternization of poets with tastes in common . ''

		The poets of
America	LOCATION	, on the other hand , do not lend 258 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, themselves to such a system of grouping , ex - cept in a few cases .

		There is , no doubt , a cer - tain unity in the methods and the endeavor of the academic group that we associate with the
Cambridge	LOCATION	and
Concord	LOCATION	and
Boston	LOCATION	of a gen - eration ago , and something of the same sort may be claimed for the poets of the journalistic and semi-Bohemian group that we associate with the
New York	LOCATION	of the corresponding period .

		But in the main , our poets have been charac - terized by individualism , by results that must doubtless be described as derivative , but that derive from the general English tradition rather than from any strongly-marked interactions and obligations to special leadership .

		The only satisfactory order of arrangement thus appeared to be that of sequence in time .

		Mr.
Steel	PERSON	man finds it convenient to divide our first poetical century into eight sections .

		The first of them has something of the char - acter of a prologue , and includes such names as Freneau ,
Paulding	LOCATION	,
Allston	LOCATION	,
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	, and
Dana	PERSON	.

		Then follow three divisions , of about fifteen years each , constituting what is called the '' First Lyrical Period . ''

		In the first of these divisions we find
Halleck	PERSON	,
Drake	PERSON	,
Bryant	PERSON	,
Sprague	PERSON	,
Percival	PERSON	, and
Pinckney	PERSON	.

		In the sec - ond we find
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Willis	PERSON	,
Hoffman	PERSON	,
Long	LOCATION	- fellow ,
Whittier	LOCATION	,
Poe	PERSON	, and
Holmes	PERSON	.

		In the third we find
Lowell	PERSON	,
Whitman	PERSON	,
Parsons	PERSON	,
Boker	PERSON	,
Taylor	PERSON	, and
Stoddard	PERSON	.

		Then follows the '' Second Lyrical Period , '' also in three divisions , each of about ten years .

		In the first we find Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	,
Hayne	PERSON	, Mrs.
Jackson	PERSON	, Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	, Mr. and Mrs.
Piatt	PERSON	, Mrs.
Moulton	PERSON	, Mr.
Winter	PERSON	, Mr.
Aldrich	PERSON	, Mr.
Harte	PERSON	,
Sill	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Miller	PERSON	, and
Lanier	PERSON	.

		In the second we find Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	,
Miss Thomas	PERSON	,
Miss Lazarus	PERSON	, Mr.
Van Dyke	PERSON	, and Mr.
R. U. Johnson	PERSON	.

		In the third we find Mr.
Wood	PERSON	berry ,
Bunner	PERSON	, Mrs.
Deland	LOCATION	,
Miss Cone	PERSON	, and
Miss Guiney	LOCATION	.

		Finally , we have a section that forms a sort of epilogue , and in - cludes many names of our most recent writers , among them being Mr.
Robert Cameron Rog	PERSON	- ers ,
Miss Sophie Jewett	PERSON	,
Richard Hovey	PERSON	, Mr.
Cawein	PERSON	,
Miss Aldrich	PERSON	, Mr.
E. A. Robinson	PERSON	,
Miss Josephine Peabody	PERSON	, and Miss
Helen Hay	PERSON	.

		It is evident enough that the poetical show - ing of our first century has little significance from the cosmopolitan point of view , although , as we shall urge a little further on , it has much significance for us as a nation .

		Let us see how it compares with the showing of the mother - country .

		The twelve greatest English poets of the same period are
Keats	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	,
Byron	PERSON	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Coleridge	PERSON	,

		The best dozen of our American poets are probably
Bryant	PERSON	,
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Holmes	PERSON	,
Longfellow	LOCATION	,
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Poe	PERSON	,
Whitman	LOCATION	,
Whittier	LOCATION	,
Lanier	PERSON	,
Taylor	PERSON	, Mr.
Aldrich	PERSON	, and Mr.
Sted	PERSON	- man .

		There is obviously little room for com - parison between the two groups .

		From the standpoint of disinterested criticism it is hardly too much to say that in absolute value every one of the English group outweighs the best of the Americans .

		It would require an excess of patriotic zeal to dispute a conclusion so obvious to the impartial observer .

		But with - out blinking this fact , we have no need to hide our diminished heads , for the poets of
America	LOCATION	have done for us a work which the poets of the mother-country ,
Shakespeare	PERSON	and all , could not have done for us : they have kept the torch of our national idealism aflame , and have touched our national spirit to issues as fine as any that have engaged the consciousness of the peoples of the Old World .

		To do these things is the true service of poetry , and , knowing how well our own poets have done them for us , we may take a just pride in their achievements , caring little for comparisons which , in a case like this , must be peculiarly invidious .

		When Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	reached the conclusion '' that if a native anthology must yield to the foreign one in wealth of choice production , it might prove to be , from an equally vital point of view , the more significant of the two , '' he occupied ground that was less paradoxical than it seemed .

		The significance of a corpus of national song rests not so much upon its absolute artistic value as upon its power to mould the ideals of a people by giving expres - sion to those higher instincts that are always groping toward the light , but that may fail of their purpose when the light is obscured .

		This Republic was founded upon an idealism finer than any hitherto known in the modern world , and it is to our poets , far more than to our so-called practical men , that we owe the perpetuation of that idealism in our hearts .

		It is their teaching that has inspired us to hope in our darkest hour ; it is a belief in the potency of their messages that still rebukes our wavering faith in so momentous a crisis of our national life as that which we confront in this closing year of the century .

		We may well ask , with the editor of the present collection , what constitutes the real significance of the poetry of any nation .

		Is it '' the essential quality of its material as poetry , '' or is it '' its quality as an expression and in -
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 259 terpretation of the time itself '' ?

		Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	declares for the latter of these alternatives , and urges that view with much logical force . ''

		Our own poetry excels as a recognizable voice in utterance of the emotions of a people .

		The storm and stress of youth have been upon us , and the nation has not lacked its lyric cry ; meanwhile the typical senti - ments of piety , domesticity , freedom , have made our less impassioned verse at least sincere .

		One who un - derrates the significance of our literature , prose or verse , as both the expression and the stimulant of national feeling , as of import in the past and to the future of
America	LOCATION	, and therefore of the world , is de - ficient in that critical insight which can judge even of its own day unwarped by personal taste or deference to public impression .

		He shuts his eyes to the fact that at times , notably throughout the years resulting in the Civil War , this literature has been a ' force . '

		Its verse until the dominance of prose fiction well into the seventies , let us say formed the staple of current reading ; and fortunate it was while pirated foreign writings , sold cheaply everywhere , handicapped the evolution of a native prose school that the books of the ' elder American poets ' lay on the centre-tables of our households , and were read with zest by young and old . ''

		If our poets have not been great poets in the world - sense , they have accomplished great things for our spiritual life , and our feeling toward them is of gratitude and reverence commingled .

		They have twined themselves about our affections as no others could have done , and have become associated with our fondest recollections and our deepest aspira - tions .

		And our love is bestowed not only upon our
Whittier	LOCATION	and our
Holmes	PERSON	, our
Emerson	PERSON	and our
Lowell	PERSON	, but also upon those of our lesser singers who have touched some intimate chord of our consciousness and awakened the responsive thrill .

		Here in this volume are five or six hundred names , and who shall assert that the least of those who bear them has not contrib - uted something of value to the general store , has not proved himself worthy of his race and help - ful of its spiritual advancement ?

		What their collective endeavor has meant to us as a nation is beyond the power of words to testify .

		But it is at least suggested by the felicitous lines in which Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	himself describes his vision of '' the constellated matin choir '' that '' sang together in the dawn , '' and tells us how he '' Heard their stately hymning , saw their light Resolve in flame that evil long inwrought With what was else the goodliest domain Of freedom warded by the ancient sea . ''

		Those to whom the sweep of that vision has been revealed can have no misgivings concern - ing the true worth of American poetry , for their feelings are merged in the one emotion of swelling pride at thought of their share in so noble a national inheritance .

		MEMOIRS OF AN AMERICAN HISTORIAN .

		* Reckoning vividness of portraiture to be the right aim of biography , we must consider Mr.
Farnham	PERSON	's life of
Francis Parkman	PERSON	a wholly admirable book .

		We have not for some time had the pleasure of examining a work of its class which so honestly and interestingly re - deems the promise of its title .

		Not for one moment throughout his 360 or so pages does the author , so far as we can detect , lose sight of the real business in hand , and go straying off , after the manner of so many biographers , into some lane or blind alley of extraneous disquisition , astride of a hobby of his own , and quite forgetful of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's admirable saying about holding fast to one 's subject .

		At the outset of his task , Mr.
Farnham	PERSON	found himself confronted by a sort of moral dilemma arising out of his respect for Park - man 's extreme reserve and his own conviction that such reserve must be ignored by the biog - rapher .

		It is not unlikely that
Parkman	PERSON	him - self would have preferred that no life of him at all should be written .

		He liked retirement , and scorned display .

		He had , to put it mildly , no great respect for that section of the public which rejoices in the title of the '' plain people , '' and which has fallen heir to the flattery that place-hunting politicians used to bestow upon kings and courtiers .

		He strongly denied that the public has a right to pry into the private life of a man because he is an artist ; and in so far as such prying is prompted by vulgar curiosity , or the hope of finding something toothsome in the way of scandal or '' unforeseen revelations , '' all should agree with him .

		But , on the other hand , we agree with Mr.
Farnham	PERSON	that the public has great concern with and even a certain right of expediency to pry into such facts in the life of an artist and such ele - ments in his personal character and conduct as may lead to a better understanding of his works .

		The matter also , as well as the style , is in some degree the man .

		It reflects the pur - suits to which , on the whole , his tastes have directed him ; it is tinged by the prejudices born of his experiences and condition in life .

		There are few obscurities of allusion or pecu - liarities -LRB- let us add perversities -RRB- of view in the printed book that may not be explained by the * LIFE OF FKANCIS PABKMAN .

		260 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, knowledge of some incident or emergency in the life of the writer .

		Most of us would prob - ably be shocked to find how little pure reason has helped us to what we call our convictions .

		Parkman , no more than any other author , could elude the personal equation in his writings ; and as he was a perfectly frank man , and in general one with a rather unusually strong conviction that his own ways and views were the right ones , that equation must in his case , save where his treatment is purely pictorial and objective , as it often is , be carefully reckoned with .

		His personality is stamped , clear-cut and impressive , on his work ; and thus , while there is much in the work that portrays and defines the man , the work may be far more justly un - derstood and keenly enjoyed through such information as it is the biographer 's province to give .

		In figuring
Parkman	PERSON	, people are apt to think of him as having something peculiarly and essentially American in his make-up .

		The no - tion , no doubt , arises from associating him with the themes he elected to treat in his histories , and the enthusiasm he showed for them ; and it is largely true .

		But he was far from sharing some of the beliefs and convictions which go to the root of what is commonly called ''
Ameri	PERSON	- canism . ''

		He was a contemptuous disbeliever , for instance , in the democratic principle of equality .

		He wrote of it : '' Vaguely and half unconsciously , but every day more and more , the masses hug the flattering illusion that one man is essentially about as good as another .

		They will not deny that there is a great difference in the quality of horses or dogs , but they refuse to see it in their own genus ... And yet the essential difference between man and man is incomparably greater than that between horse and horse , or dog and dog ... The history of the progress of mankind is the history of its leading minds .

		The masses , left to themselves , are hardly capable of progress , except material progress , and even that imperfectly . ''

		It must not be imagined that with
Parkman	PERSON	the upper classes meant in any sense the mon - eyed classes .

		The vulgar rich man he disliked and distrusted quite as much as he did the ignorant and turbulent poor man . ''

		Two enemies , unknown before , have risen like spirits of darkness on our social and political horizon an ignorant proletariat and a half-taught plutocracy .

		Between lie the classes , happily still numerous and strong , in whom rests our salvation . ''

		But that salvation ,
Parkman	PERSON	held , and the sal - vation of every democracy , must come from good leadership from the recognition by the people of the superiority , and the consequent right to guide and govern , of the real elite of the nation , of the men of worth and cultivation who could direct the masses with wisdom , foil with their aid the demagogue and the selfish capitalist , and set the national ideal above the level of material interests .

		His creed was short and simple . ''

		My political faith lies between two vicious ex - tremes , democracy and absolute authority , each of which I detest the more because it tends to reach into the other .

		I do not object to a good constitutional mon - archy , but prefer a conservative republic , where intelli - gence and character , and not numbers , hold the reins of power . ''

		Patriots were the historical figures whom
Parkman	PERSON	most admired ; and his hero was
Washington	LOCATION	.

		Second to
Washington	LOCATION	in his esteem came
Hamilton	PERSON	.

		For
Franklin	PERSON	, with his '' Poor Richard '' philosophy , he had scant regard .

		Jefferson he disliked exceedingly for his sentimental
Rousseauism	PERSON	and his flattery of the mob .

		Lincoln 's great qualities and high services he somewhat grudgingly admitted ; but he thought him generally overrated , and , on the whole , '' a man whose undeniable worth and usefulness were due to circumstances more than to inherent ability . ''

		To ascribe a man 's greatness to circumstances seems to us in gen - eral a cheap , not to say a doubtful , explanation of it .

		That Lincoln was not crushed rather than made or , as we should prefer to say , revealed by those same '' circumstances , '' may seem to most of us the most remarkable thing about him .

		Parkman appears to have been a good hater .

		He disliked ministers , although he came him - self of a long line of them ; and he once ex - pressed in writing the hope that a boy who had been named after him would `` be brought up to some respectable calling and not allowed to become a minister . ''

		Theologians he roundly denounced as `` vermin , '' describing them gen - erally as '' vague , gushing , soft , spoilt by women 's attentions , sentimental , unenergetic , and insincere in their professions of faith . ''

		There may have been a vein of jocose exagger - ation in all this ; but there was certainly none in his denunciations of the selfish politician .

		Statesmanship he honored as the highest of callings ; but no words could express his scorn and distrust of the '' political reptile '' whose '' statesmanship '' is that of Mr.
Platt	PERSON	and whose political end is that of Mr.
Croker	PERSON	.

		The spectacle of a great community theoreti - cally free yet bound and gagged by the ma - chine , and periodically led to the polls like lambs to the slaughter , to choose between in - competence and rascality on one side , and
1900	DATE	.

		J THE DIAL 261 rascality and incompetence on the other , roused him to fury . ''

		Never , since history recorded the life of nations , was such a people so led , or rather entangled in such a political mesh-work .

		We make no allusion to this party or that .

		... As freemen and sovereigns we go to the polls and cast our votes , not after our own judgment , but at the dictation of self-constituted knots and com - binations of men whom we can neither esteem nor trust .

		... A many-headed despotism is exercised in the name of the largest liberty .

		... If to degrade public morals , sink the national reputation , weaken the national coun - cils , rout out the race of statesmen , and place pliant incompetency in control of our destiny , if these are the ends of government , then is our political manage - ment a master-piece of wit . ''

		Turning to the spectacle of the Civil War ,
Parkman	PERSON	saw , in the great popular uprising , the nation for once snapping like threads the fiimsy shackles with which it had tamely sub - mitted to be bound , resuming the control of its destinies , and revealing democracy in its grand - est aspect .

		Then , he adds : '' The political reptiles hid away , or pretended to change their nature , and for a time the malarious air was purged as by a thunder-storm .

		Peace brought a change ... The lion had had his turn , and now the fox , the jackal , and the wolf took theirs .

		Every sly political trickster , whom the storm had awed into ob - scurity , now found his opportunity .

		The reptiles crawled out again , multiplied , infested caucuses , conventions , and
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		But the people was the saddest spec - tacle ; the same people that had shown itself so heroic in the hour of military trial , were now perplexed , be - wildered , tossed between sense and folly , right and wrong , taking advice of mountebanks , and swallowing their filthy nostrums .

		The head of Demos was as giddy as his heart had been strong . ''

		Popular education , as conducted in this country ,
Parkman	PERSON	did not believe to be an unmixed good .

		`` It has produced an immense number of readers ; but what thinkers are to be found may be said to exist in spite of it .

		The public school has put money in abundance in the pockets of the dealers in sensation stories , sensation newspapers , and all the swarm of trivial , sickly , and rascally literature .

		... In our lit - erary markets , educated tastes are completely outrid - den by uneducated or half-educated tastes , and the commodity is debased accordingly .

		Thus , the editor of a magazine may be a man of taste and talents ; but his interests as a man of letters and his interests as a man of business are not the same . '

		Why do n't you make your magazine what it ought to be ? '

		we once asked a well-known editor . '

		Because , ' he replied ' if we did we should lose four-fifths of our circulation . ' ''

		Parkman 's interest in the public schools was intense , and it was largely to the possibility of making them builders of character , instead of mere agents for brain-cramming , that he looked for the safety of democracy for the develop - ment of those qualities in the masses which should enable them to distinguish good leader - ship from bad , and deliver them from the rule of the '' boss '' and the wiles of the demagogue .

		Yet he did not see much hope for the schools so long as they too are within reach of the low politician . ''

		They demand the best intelligence and the best conscience of the community ; and yet their control rests , in the last resort , with legislatures and municipal bodies representing in part that very public which needs edu - cation the most wretched , wire-pulling demagogues , ignorant as the constituencies that chose them , reckless of public duty , and without the faintest notion of what true education is . ''

		In the plan of his memoir , Mr.
Farnham	PERSON	has departed from the usual method of making biography , from cover to cover , a narration of events in chronological order . ''

		I have tried , '' he says , `` to simplify the reader 's labor and gain vividness of portraiture , by confining chro - nology chiefly to one chapter , thenceforth viewing facts and experiences as bearing mainly on achievement and development . ''

		The work thus divides itself into three parts : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Park - man 's preparation , -LRB- 2 -RRB- the reflection of his personality in his works , and -LRB- 3 -RRB- the story of his moral growth .

		Mr.
Farnham	PERSON	's book is an eminently read - able , as well as a searching and scholarly , account of the career , personality , and achieve - ment of this last of the trio of American his - torians
Prescott	PERSON	,
Motley	ORGANIZATION	, and
Parkman	PERSON	whose works so forcibly refute the curious no - tion that charm of style and picturesque narra - tion are somehow incompatible with painstaking research and historical accuracy .

		The volume is neatly made , and contains two portraits of
Parkman	LOCATION	, one taken in early manhood , the other the likeness with which most readers are familiar .

Oct. 16	DATE	,
Hutchinson Robbing	PERSON	, a descendant of
Anne Hutchinson	PERSON	, was for nine years speaker of the
Massachusetts House of Representatives	ORGANIZATION	, and afterwards lieutenant-governor of the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		Through her mother ,
Elizabeth Murray	PERSON	, she was of Scotch descent , and cousin to
John M. Forbes	PERSON	, a man whose conception of citizenship was of the best type our country has produced .

		At sixteen ,
Anne Jean	PERSON	was graduated from the Ladies ' Academy of
Dorchester	LOCATION	.

		She had learned to write a plain , clear hand , and she could spell ; for accomplishments , she had ac - quired the '' use of the globes , '' and a little French and Latin .

		During the next few years we catch glimpses of the young girl , now as - sisting in the housework of a large family on her father 's farm at
Brush Hill	LOCATION	, and now going into society in
Boston	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	, making her own party gowns .

		An embroidered cam - bric dress of exquisite fineness , and an
India	LOCATION	muslin for a change , worn with different colored ribbons , were
Anne Jean	PERSON	's party dresses through several successive seasons .

		To please the young men who liked to see fair hands employed , the young ladies of those days em - broidered samplers and mourning-pieces in company .

		An anecdote records a couplet for a mourning-piece , which is good enough to serve as a general epitaph for fancy work .

		Miss
Robbins	PERSON	went to visit some friends of hers in
Hingham	LOCATION	, three quaint ladies who per - sisted in remaining British subjects to the end of their lives , and who wore purple , Court mourning , for
George IV.	PERSON	, fifty years after the Declaration of Independence .

		A young man calling on the ladies one day found them busy embroidering mourning-pieces , samplers in which tall women in short waists and long skirts forever stand weeping by a monument .

		They begged for a motto for their mourning - piece , and instantly got this bit of wit : '' In useless labors all their hours are spent , They murder time , then work his monument . ''

		In the
autumn of 1811	DATE	,
Miss Robbins	PERSON	mar - ried Judge
Joseph Lynian	PERSON	, of
Northampton	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, who was twice her age , and a widower with five children .

		In spite of the disparity of years , the marriage was a most happy one , and from that time on Mrs.
Lyman	PERSON	lived with a fulness of life that was at once an inspiration and a charm to all who knew her .

		She was the moving spirit , not only in her own home as the mother of a large family of children , but in an ever-widening social sphere that ultimately came to include many of the best - known people of her time .

		Northampton in
1811	DATE	was a village of about four thousand inhabitants , and it had already acquired that character which has become more marked with the differentiation of the place as a college town .

		There were no very rich people and no very poor people , but many persons of culture and refinement made their homes in the village and enjoyed its beautiful scenery in ease and contentment .

		George Ban - croft established there the
Round Hill School	ORGANIZATION	for boys , which became famous all over the country .

		The elder Dr.
Flint	PERSON	was the village doctor , and Dr.
Austin Flint	PERSON	went from North - ampton to
Buffalo	LOCATION	, where in a few years his studies in the pathology of typhoid fever gave promise of his great medical career .

		The roll of the professors and students of the North - ampton law school records the names of
Sam	PERSON	- uel
Howe	ORGANIZATION	,
Hooker Ashmun	PERSON	,
George Tyng	PERSON	,
George S. Hillard	PERSON	,
Russell Sturgis	PERSON	, and others equally well known .

		Every summer an influx of visitors came into the valley , for before the building of the railroad , in
1843	DATE	,
North	LOCATION	- ampton was on the high-road between
Boston	LOCATION	, the
Berkshire Hills	ORGANIZATION	, and
Saratoga Springs	LOCATION	.

		Among the birds of passage that flit through Mrs.
Lyman	PERSON	's letters , we are made acquainted with '' the great Mr.
Wirt	PERSON	, '' and Mrs.
Wirt	PERSON	, '' not a lady of great mental attainments , but of much delicacy and refinement , and good judgment , and of many showy accomplish - ments . ''


Daniel Webster	PERSON	listens absorbed in
Miss Flint	LOCATION	's music for an hour and a half , and then rouses himself to compliment her with stately gallantry .

		On
September 13 , 1835	DATE	, Mrs.
Lyman	PERSON	writes to her son , '' Then there has been a family of Longfellows from
Port	LOCATION	- land , very interesting , agreeable people . ''

		During the year 1824 Judge and Mrs.
Lyman	PERSON	led the little band who '' signed off '' from the
First Church	ORGANIZATION	,
Jonathan Edwards	PERSON	's church , and founded the Unitarian society in
Northampton	LOCATION	.

		The seceders engaged a liberal minister to preach to them , and held services in the town hall until they could build a church of their own .

		THE DIAL 263 * a pious indigent , ' but lo !

		an angel unawares ! ''

		The angel unawares was
Ralph Waldo Emer	PERSON	- son , with whom Mrs.
Lyman	PERSON	then formed a friendship that lasted as long as she lived .

		Many years later , when the death of her hus - band and the marriage of her last remaining child had left her alone in the large house in the centre of the village , her diary records how
Emerson	PERSON	came and spent two days with her , how he went with her to visit a poor family in whom she was interested , and how he left behind him an afterglow of kind words and inspiring thought .

		Emerson 's transcendental - ism never seemed to disturb her , although at one time she fears that one of her children had gone over to '' those loose enders , '' mean - ing the transcendentalists .

		To one who could not understand
Emerson	PERSON	, she said , '' Well , you call that transcendental .

		I call it the pro- foundest common sense . ''

		Mrs.
Lyman	PERSON	's appreciation of
Emerson	LOCATION	was after all more personal than intellectual , for though she had large views of men and things , her type of mind was essentially conservative .


Harriet Martineau	PERSON	visited her , and she was so charmed with the English lady 's `` simple , un - affected eloquence '' and `` delightful character '' that she began to read her books .

		The books were not so delightful . ''

		I would have excused her for everything but her slander of the women of our country , and her chapter on the * Eights of Women , ' in no part of which do I sympathize with her .

		I desire no increase of power or responsibility . ''

		Only a few years before this was written , the little
Elizabeth Cady	PERSON	was tearing out of her father 's law books all those laws whose injustice to women made her young blood boil with indignation .

		Mrs.
Lyman	PERSON	had excellent ideas on education , for boys ; her only objection to Mr.
Bancroft	PERSON	's school was that not enough attention was paid to English studies , and she insisted that her son at least should study English as well as
Latin	LOCATION	, Greek , and French .

		Her own education had depended on the accident of birth in a good family , on the possession of a good mind , and a love of reading .

		But , as in the case of women less happily circumstanced socially than herself , it does not seem to have occurred to her that girls needed a sound mental training as well as boys . ''

		It is rare , '' she writes , '' to find well educated women who have grown up in prosperity .

		If their minds are tolerably cultivated , their hearts are perverted , their objects of pursuit are shadows . ''

		How could women , in prosperity or in adversity , become well educated , when there was no endowment for the education of girls , and no public opinion to demand it ?


Harriet Martineau	PERSON	raised a voice in the wilderness , and Mrs.
Lyman	PERSON	found it discordant , and refused to listen to it .

		Just so , she was not stirred by the anti-slavery agitation , the one great question of her time .


Lydia Maria Child	PERSON	, her neighbor and friend , tells of the many lively encounters she had with Mrs.
Lyman	PERSON	on the subject , and how she only succeeded in getting her on the fence and hoped she would jump in the right direction .

		Mrs.
Lyman	PERSON	was an indefatigable reader , and her letters are full of comments on books , couched in the formal language of the last cen - tury , and smacking for the most part of its taste .

		She thought
Wordsworth	PERSON	'' excelled in the highest order of poetry , in the moral sublime , '' but the poets she quotes are Aken - side and
Beattie	PERSON	.

		The opinion of a cultivated woman reading the novels of Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	as they came out might have been worth while .

		Mrs.
Lyman	PERSON	on Sir
Walter	PERSON	is almost as amus - ing as she is disappointing .

		She was some - what of an aristocrat in her likings , '' In reading , nothing is more fatiguing to me than minute details of low people , with which I think this book -LSB- the `` Pioneers '' -RSB- , like the `` Spy , '' is very much encumbered . ''

		They tell us nowadays that '' minute details of low people '' is high art .

		One '' trumpery novel '' did take her off her pedestal , and we have an entertaining account of the perturbation it caused . ''

		I have read *
Jane Eyre	PERSON	, ' '' she writes to her daughter , '' and though it is in - tensely interesting , I advise you not to read it , for I think it has a most immoral tendency . ''

		By the next post the daughter received a letter from a friend who was staying with her mother , saying : '' Your mother has been completely carried away with `
Jane Eyre	PERSON	. '

		She went out yesterday and bought herself a pair of new shoes .

		After she came home she took up '
Jane	PERSON	' and read till tea-time ; then she read till bed-time .

		Then I retired , and she read till nearly morning , finding , when she went to bed at last , that the toes of her new shoes were fairly burnt through , over the dying embers . ''

		Mrs.
Lesley	PERSON	suggests that the loss of her shoes may have affected her opinion of
Rochester	LOCATION	, for she always became very indignant over that part of the story where
Jane	PERSON	, after leav - ing
Rochester	LOCATION	, forgot her little bundle of clothes . ''

		So shiftless of her , '' she would ex - claim , '' to go off without a change of linen .

		I 've no patience with her . ''

		264 THE DIAL The story well illustrates the local tradition of Mrs.
Lyman	PERSON	, a woman with an open , in - quiring mind , and impulsive nature , full of ideas , and possessing a fund of vigorous and picturesque English in which to express them .

		When she wrote she was painfully liable to make the little fishes talk like whales , but she talked delightfully .

		She had a racy vocabulary of her own , full of humor and fun .

		A certain blue print stuff , suggesting orphan asylums , which she thought an excellent material for her little girls ' every-day frocks , she called '' blue mortification , '' because they detested it .

		For people who backed down under difficulties , '' abdicated , '' in her language , she had no use . ''

		Don ' t abdicate , '' she would say , in her large , helpful way , to a friend in a peck of trouble . ''

		Gild your lot with contentment '' was her summing up of a complaining woman .

		She writes to her mother : `` What with the con - flicting claims of society and of children , I can not compare my life this
summer	DATE	to any - thing but living on the top of a high tree in a great gale of wind , in which all one 's efforts are bent to holding on . ''

		If only the students of
Smith College	ORGANIZATION	would say things in that way !

		Mrs.
Lyman	PERSON	would thoroughly have enjoyed the new
Northampton	LOCATION	, with the thronging col - lege girls going up and down the Main street , where now a row of shops has displaced her home .

		She would have taken them all into her heart and mothered them .

		Play enough they would have had , and discipline .


Anne Jean Lyman	PERSON	was not an advanced woman , but she believed in making the most of opportunity .

		She did it herself , and she saw to it that every - body else did who came within her influence .

		She died in
1867	DATE	, before
Smith College	ORGANIZATION	was founded , and her personality is vague to the students .

		But they all know her name , for they go down through the back campus to the college garden , where across the lane lies Para - dise .

Ernest Rhys	PERSON	's record of the life and work of
Frederic Lord Leighton	PERSON	is published by the

		With the exception of a few alterations and corrections , and the addition of a chapter on `` Lord
Leighton	PERSON	's

		THREE BOOKS ABOUT BUSKIN .

		* We have learned with much regret of the decision reached by the literary executors of
John Kuskin	PERSON	.

		They have concluded , it seems , that a definitive and authoritative biography is not desirable , partly because of the existence of Mr.
Collingwood	PERSON	's admirable book , and partly , we presume , because their examination of
Ruskin	PERSON	's literary remains did not disclose any considerable amount of material hitherto unpublished .

		While we are bound to defer to the judgment of Professor
Norton	PERSON	and his associates , we must confess to a certain disap - pointment at their decision .

		Mr.
Collingwood	PERSON	's biography is excellent as far as it goes , but it seems to carry reticence a little too far , and certainly has not exhausted the treasures of
Ruskin	ORGANIZATION	's voluminous correspondence .

		Even had his own '' Prseterita '' been completed , we should still wish for the complete record , from an objective point of view , of that rich and instructive life .

		Such a record may perhaps be given us in the future , but for the present we must remain contented with what we have , and with the many books about
Ruskin	PERSON	, not primarily biographical in scope , which have been written by his critics and his disciples .

		Three such books have appeared since his death , and to give some account of them is the purpose of the present article .

		Mrs.
Alice Meynell	PERSON	's ''
John Ruskin	PERSON	'' is written for the series entitled '' Modern English Writers . ''

		Its method , after a brief introduc - tory chapter , is to consider successively and briefly
Ruskin	PERSON	's principal works , devoting to each book -LRB- and in the case of '' Modern Paint - ers , '' each volume -RRB- a special chapter .

		Each of these chapters sets forth the leading ideas of the work considered , includes a few illustrative extracts , and brings to the discussion a certain element of the author 's personal idiosyncrasy .

		The author is herself a writer of such distinc - tion that this personal note always proves in - teresting , although it is sometimes irritating , and often excites to protest .

		Mrs.
Meynell	PERSON	's literary style , with its excessive desire to be nice , does not always produce its effect without visible strain , and can not be acquitted of some - *

		THE DIAL 265 thing akin to preciosity .

		When she speaks of
Ruskin	PERSON	as having got something of his dic - tion from
Gibbon	PERSON	, '' who did more than any other to disorganize the English language , '' and when she assumes an air of patronizing superi - ority toward
Scott	PERSON	, she certainly gives us pause , and her critical judgment suffers severe dis - credit .

		But her criticism is , for the most part , acute and delicate , the product of a finely trained intellect , having just enough of per - sonal idiosyncrasy to give it piquancy and to make it provocative of thought , without be - coming at any time fundamentally unsympa - thetic .

		In dealing with questions of the technical art of painting , the writer makes it clear that she does not allow even
Ruskin	PERSON	to do her thinking for her , although she does not seem to preserve her complete intellectual poise in the discussion of
Ruskin	ORGANIZATION	's social and economic vagaries .

		Mr.
M. H. Spielmann	PERSON	's ``
John Ruskin	PERSON	'' is a sketch of the life , work , and opinions of its subject , put together in a scrappy sort of fashion , and not particularly noteworthy for style or critical insight .

		Mr.
Spielmann	PERSON	writes from the standpoint of a devoted friend and enthusiastic admirer , and brings many bits of personal reminiscence arid extracts from pri - vate letters into his book .

		The work is chiefly valuable for its illustrations , which include the series , practically complete , of the portraits of
Ruskin	PERSON	which readers of '' The Magazine of Art '' will remember as having appeared in the pages of that periodical about fifteen years ago .

		The later years of
Ruskin	PERSON	's life at Con - iston are rather fully sketched , and give us a charming picture of the closing chapter of his life .

		M. de La Sizeranue 's volume entitled '' Rus - kin and the Religion of Beauty '' consists of three essays which first appeared in the '' Revue des Deux Mondes , '' and which were afterwards collected into the book which the
Countess of Galloway	ORGANIZATION	has now translated into English .

		It forms one of the most noteworthy of the many recent works in which French critics have dealt with English writers in a spirit of the most generous appreciation , besides bringing to their task a capacity for painstaking investigation that puts many of our own writers to shame .

		The pioneer work of
Taine	PERSON	has borne rich fruit during the past score of years , and of this fruit the volume before us is a conspicuous example .

		It is easily the weightiest of the three now under review , besides deriving peculiar interest from the fact that it records the impressions of a competent foreign student of our literature .

		The suggestion of Taine just now made by us is more than fortuitous .

		The writer approaches his subject very much as
Taine	PERSON	would have approached it , and treats it with the same com - bination of picturesqueness , vivacity , and philo - sophical analysis .

		He begins by telling us how his attention was first called to
Ruskin	LOCATION	, when one day in
Florence	LOCATION	he came upon a party of English girls in
Santa Maria Novella	LOCATION	, reading him in the presence of the frescoes as a sort of liturgy .

		Another year , in
London	LOCATION	, he was the guest of a household in which the table linen of the family was a product of
Langdale	LOCATION	, and the host wore a coat of cloth made at
St. George 's Mill	ORGANIZATION	on the Isle of Man .

		Again his attention was called to the man whose activities had so singular a power of be - coming reflected in unexpected ways , and he determined to make an exhaustive study of the personality that had so aroused , first his curi - osity , then his interest , and finally his sym - pathy .

		He determined to '' retrace through
Europe	LOCATION	and through the history of ' aesthetic * the path the master had trod . ''

		How the writer prepared himself for his task is told in the fol - lowing words : '' In
Switzerland	LOCATION	, at
Florence	LOCATION	, at
Venice	LOCATION	, at
Amiens	LOCATION	, on the banks of the Rhine or of the
Arno	LOCATION	, everywhere where he had worked I too worked after him , sometimes sketching over again the sketches whence he had drawn his theories and his examples , wait - ing for the same light he had waited for , always seeking , as it were , on the eternal monuments the fugitive shadows of his thought .

		Then for several years I delayed to write until his system dawned upon me , no longer as a delicious medley but as a harmony of great lines , like those Alpine mountains which he loved so well . ''

		A work undertaken in this spirit , and carried out with this thoroughness , could hardly fail to prove an important addi - tion to the long list of books devoted to the exposition of
Ruskin	ORGANIZATION	's life and ideas .

		To the non-English reader it must have been a revela - tion , and to the English reader it comes as a highly stimulating and suggestive treatise , although it does not hesitate to quote the pass - ages most familiar to him , and to characterize the teachings of
Ruskin	PERSON	with much detail that in the case of the English reader might be left for granted .

		We know of no single volume better fitted to serve for an introduction to the thought of the great critic .

		It is clear in its exposition and unfailing in its sympathy ; yet it does not blink at inconsistencies , and it is 266 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, far from giving a slavish adherence to those vagaries of temper which have doubtless les - sened
Raskin	PERSON	's influence , although they are in reality but as the spots upon the sun , barely affecting his ethical fervor , and in nowise making dim the radiance of his resplendent genius .

MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		THE WORLD 'S WHEAT PROBLEM .

		* It will be remembered that Sir
William Crookes	PERSON	, in his presidential address delivered in 1
# 98	DATE	, at the
Bristol	LOCATION	meeting of the
British Association	ORGANIZATION	for the
Advancement of Science	ORGANIZATION	, raised a voice of warning in respect to the inad - equacy of present methods of cultivation to provide a supply of wheat large enough to meet the continually increasing demand of the world 's growing population of bread-eaters .

		He pointed out that the consumption of wheat per capita was increasing in almost all the wheat-consuming countries and that the num - ber of consumers is steadily growing .

		He said : '' In
1871	DATE	the bread-eaters of the world numbered 371,000,000 .

		In
1881	DATE	the number rose to 416,000,000 ; in
1891	DATE	to 472,600.000 ; and at the present time they number 516,500 , - 000 . ''

		Observing that the rate of increase appeared to be geometrical , he proceeded to inquire where were to be grown the additional supplies necessary to provide for the additional millions of bread-eaters soon to come into being .

		After glancing in succession at the wheat growing capabilities of the
United States	LOCATION	,
Russia	LOCATION	,
India	LOCATION	,
Australasia	LOCATION	,
Argentina	LOCATION	, and various other countries , he reached the conclusion that only about 100,000,000 acres in addition to the area already under wheat ` would be available for the production of that grain .

		At present rates of yield , this area , he estimated , would barely supply the wheat needed to feed 230 , - 000,000 additional bread-eaters , and this addi - tional number , he calculated , would come into being by
1931	DATE	.

		Whence , then , were to come the supplies for the further additions to the number of bread - eaters to be made after that date , supposing pop - ulation to continue increasing at the present rate ?

		Sir
William	PERSON	's reply was that increased production per acre could alone meet this addi - tional demand .

		This , however , would require * THE WHEAT PROBLEM .

		By Sir
William Crookes	PERSON	,
F.R S.	PERSON	`` Questions of the Day '' Series .


New York	LOCATION	.

		Q. P. Put - nam 's Sons .

		vast additions to the supply of nitrogenous fer - tilizer .

		Conservation of sewage was referred to as one possible source of such fertilizer ; but a method of fixing the free nitrogen of the atmosphere at a cost sufficiently low to make the resulting product commercially available was the one thing needful to place at the service of mankind a practically unlimited supply .

		This artificial production of nitrate , Sir Will - iam regarded as clearly within view ; and in this he saw the means of bringing up the aver - age yield of wheat from 12.7 to 30 bushels per acre .

		Thus would the date when demand shall outrun supply be put so far ahead as to relieve the wheat-eaters of the present , and at least a few generations of their descendents , from all occasion for anxiety .

		As to a remoter future , Sir
William	PERSON	suggested that '' instead of trust - ing mainly to food-stuffs which flourish in temperate climates , '' the nations now composed of bread-eaters will '' trust more and more to the exuberant food stuffs of the tropics , '' and cited a computation of Humboldt , that '' acre for acre , the food-productiveness of the banana is 133 times that of wheat . ''

		The address thus summarized Sir
William	PERSON	has included in a volume entitled '' The Wheat Problem , '' in which he moreover replies to a number of criticisms called out by his
Bristol	LOCATION	address on its original publication .

		He also includes in it a chapter on '' Our Present and Prospective Food Supply , '' by the well-known agricultural writer , Mr.
C. Wood Davis	PERSON	, of
Kansas	LOCATION	; an article on ''
America	LOCATION	and the Wheat Problem , '' by the Hon.
John Hyde	PERSON	, Statistician of the
United States Department of Agriculture	ORGANIZATION	; and a chapter by Mr.
Hyde	PERSON	on '' Certain Fallacies of Mr.
Edward Atkin	PERSON	- son '' in regard to the extent of the ability of the
United States	LOCATION	to contribute to the world 's wheat supply .

		Several short appendices and an index occupy the last thirty of the 272 pages embraced in the volume .

		No detailed review can be attempted within the space available for the notice of this book , but the conviction may be recorded that Sir
William	PERSON	's views , though somewhat too alarm - ist in character , are nearer to the truth than those of some of the more optimistic of his critics .

		We do not think there is any serious danger of a permanent wheat shortage occur - ring within the next thirty-one years , even in the absence of that unlimited supply of nitro - genous fertilizer to which he looks as a means of escape from that calamity ; but it may become necessary to cultivate less productive lands
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 267 than are now in use , in order to produce the increased supply of food that will be required if population shall continue to multiply as rapidly as it has done for many decades past .

		This would mean increased labor for a given result , unless the disadvantage named should be offset , as it probably would be , by progress in agricultural knowledge and corresponding improvement in agricultural methods .

		One favorable circumstance is that the in - crease of population which is to cause the in - creased demand for wheat will probably occur chiefly in thinly settled regions in which there is much land that will not pay for tillage if its produce must find a market thousands of miles away , but will become convertible into profit - able wheat fields as soon as the growth of pop - ulation in its vicinity shall make that produce marketable at next to no expense for transpor - tation .

		Moreover , the growth of population in such regions , and of the domestic animals by which population is accompanied in civilized communities , will tend to the utilization of fer - tilizing resources that are in great part wasted where consumers are thousands of miles from the fields where their subsistence is produced .

		If Sir
William Crookes	PERSON	had taken due account of such changes in the comparative availability of land for food production as the growth of population will itself bring with it , he would , in our opinion , have been able to take a con - siderably more hopeful view of the future of the world 's wheat supply , quite apart from his expectation that chemistry will shortly enable man to draw on the atmosphere for unlimited supplies of nitrogen .

		Still , he has done a useful work in arousing public interest in this question , and his book will well repay an atten - tive perusal .

		Captain
Adrien de Gerlache	PERSON	, to whose enterprise the expedition owes both its origin and its successful issue , appears not to have been less suc - cessful than the Norwegian in accomplishing the objects for which the '' Belgica '' was purchased and equipped .

		Ten officers and men of science , and nine common seamen , representing five different nations , made up the personnel ; but Doctor
Nan	PERSON	- sen 's happy freedom from illness and accident was not theirs , one of the sailors being lost overboard , and the magnetician ,
Emile Danco	PERSON	, dying of the anaemia which attacked them all in a greater or less degree .

		Dr.
Cook	PERSON	reserves the consideration of the scientific aspect of this ailment for the more formal presentation of the facts gathered by the ship 's force , and he expressly disclaims an intention of setting forth the daily life of the crew ; yet it is evident that there was a lack of that marvellous good-fellowship which characterized the life on the '' Fram , '' due in good part to a lack of choice and discrimination in selecting officers and men , and to the food , largely Norwegian in character , which was not relished by the members of the crew of other nationalities .

		The expedition undoubtedly makes valuable con - tributions to the world 's knowledge .

		It raises the theory of an Antarctic continent to the dignity of hypothesis ; it extends geographical certainties over a vast area of problematical chartings made by former voyagers ; it procures for the meteorologist hourly readings of the thermometer , barometer , and other instruments through a full year ; it establishes the probability of a southern polar anticyclone ; it moves the theoretical south magnetic pole about two hundred miles , all in addition to the minor contributions to zoology and kindred sciences .

		It appears from Dr.
Cook	PERSON	's interesting and beau - tifully illustrated pages that
Patagonia	LOCATION	and
Terra del Fuego	ORGANIZATION	, still largely believed to be abodes of desolation , are thriving and growing countries , with their former asperities to be ranked along with those of the '' Great American Desert '' of our boy - hood 's geographies .

		The trail of the gold-seeker is over them both , and the discovery that sheep thrive in the interior has led to the stocking of enormous and exceedingly profitable ranches and , incidentally , to the extermination of the na - tives .

		This leads Dr.
Cook	PERSON	to remark that '' The Anglo-Saxon is the ruling spirit , and in a very short time this long deserted no-man 's - land will be a gilded paradise stocked with the healthy admix - ture of northern races which has made the United States the most progressive of the new nations of the world .

		268 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, The ruling spirit of Miss Isabel Savory 's narra - tive of '' A Sportswoman in
India	LOCATION	'' is also
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	, and the handsome book , with its thrilling pictures , affords the best possible opportunity for the psychological study of a modern Una who would have slain the lion as a common-sense precaution before lying down beside it .

		History has abundance of precedent for the modern Nimrod , and the phe - nomenon of a comely British maiden going pig - sticking , bear-hunting , and tiger-shooting is probably referable to
Diana	LOCATION	; yet it is a very modern variety of -LRB- he goddess that is here presented , with breech - loading and rapid-firing arms , and all thought of the moon omitted except as affording light for de - struction after the sun has set .

		Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	is Miss Savory 's poet of poets , but she has the habit of quoting all her rhyme without using any marks to in - dicate originality or indebtedness , leading us to sus - pect that some of the lines are her own .

		Here is an ex - ample of her vivacious mingling of prose and verse : '' On came the pig straight for the Arab 's shoulder and forelegs a gallant charge .

		Keeping her horse going at best pace , M. leaned well down , intending to lunge her spear straight into him low down in the body , just behind the shoulder , directly he was within reach .

		Her body swung forward as she made the effort there followed an instant of deadly sickness Gracious heavens !

		she missed him .

		It was but an instant ; home went the pig 's charge , and over went the Arab as though he bad been a ninepin .

		M. was hurtled into the air , a vision of sky followed , and then stars ... She did the only thing there was time to do threw herself fiat on her face and lay still .

		In another second the pig was cutting what remained of her habit into ribbons , and she could feel sharp gash after gash in the small of her back as he tore at the body of his prostrate foe .

		Then G. 's voice rang out , and never was woman more glad .

		He speared the boar and drew him off M. , who sat up once more , considerably bruised and battered , but still with plenty of life .

		The last scenes in such a contest would be sad and horrible , if they were not so full of danger and excitement .

		The pluck of the bull-dog does not beat The pluck of the gallant boar .

		He was magnificent .

		Furious with rage , again and again he literally hurled himself upon the spears in his mad longing to get at S. and G. , till at last he died , facing his foes splendid animal !

		It was quite grievous to see him lying dead . ''

		That last touch rises to the heights of the '' Walrus and the
Carpenter	PERSON	. '' '' '

		I like the walrus best , ' said
Alice	PERSON	, ' because you see he was a little sorry for the poor oysters . ' '

		He ate more than the carpenter , though , ' said Tweedledee . ''

		Another boar was even more fun : After the hunt had aroused him , he '' rolled over '' one na - tive , '' tilted '' another into a well , threw '' two wretched women , one after another both were badly cut , '' but he '' put up a good fight . ''

		Small wonder that Miss Savory concludes in respect of the British '' sportswomen '' : '' The trophies which decorate the walls of their sanctum sanctorum call forth admiration and reverence , rather than con - stitute mute witnesses of outraged womanhood . ''

		The passion for mountain-climbing is a curious evolution of our century .

		Why should man , with incredible hardship , climb to the barrenest , steepest , loftiest heights ?

		He will not rest content till he has set foot on the topmost peaks and remotest poles of this sphere , and thus rightly fulfils his mission in subjugating the earth .

		This restless mountaineering spirit animates Mr.
W. D. Wilcox	PERSON	's book on '' The Rockies of
Canada	LOCATION	. ''

		The author has spent several seasons exploring Nature 's fast - nesses in the vicinity of
Banff	LOCATION	, particularly the
Lake Louise	LOCATION	region ; and he gives us , in simple and lucid style , an account of his experiences .

		It is his opinion that '' the
Caucasus	LOCATION	and Alps , especially the latter , alone equal or surpass the Canadian Rock - ies . ''

		While the
Rockies of Canada	ORGANIZATION	are not as high as those of
Colorado	LOCATION	, `` their apparent grandeur is greater because the valleys are both deep and nar - row , richly forested , and frequently guarded by cliffs which are precipitous for three , four , or even five thousand feet . ''

		The only paths in these Rockies are the Indian trails ; and we do not know of a better description of the aboriginal road than the one here given . ''

		But when trails , either good or bad , penetrate it , how can a country be unmapped or unknown ?

		Perhaps in the same way that the natives have made foot-paths through the deserts of
Australia	LOCATION	and the jungles of
Africa	LOCATION	, the Indians of the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	have made trails through all the larger valleys of the
Rockies	ORGANIZATION	.

		These trails , which , for aught we know , represent some of the oldest of human foot-paths , are used by the Indians on their hunting expeditions .

		Before the coming of white men , they were used as a means of communication be - tween the
Kootenay Indians	LOCATION	and the tribes that inhabit the plains , for the bartering of fur , game , and horses .

		So all the important valleys and passes have well - marked trails , and the side valleys inferior ones , though it is not always easy to find them or stay on them when found .

		A trail is subject to constant degeneration , for several reasons .

		Avalanches and snow-slides sweep over it , and sometimes cover a long stretch with broken trees and great masses of rock .

		New areas of timber are burned over every year , and the charred trees , after standing a few years , begin to yield to the wind and storms and
fall	DATE	across the trail .

		Rapid mountain streams often change their courses , cutting away new banks and undermining many places where trails were made .

		Even in .

		the primeval forest , the underbrush has a constant tendency to choke these path-ways , and aged monarchs of the forest die and fall across them .

		No one ever cuts a tree , if there is a way around , be - cause every one assumes , very selfishly , that he may never come that way again .

		Thus the Indian trail is a narrow pathway , worn with the hoofs of horses , clearly marked in open meadows or deep , mossy forests , but ever winding and retreating to avoid a multitude of obstacles , and usually disappearing altogether when most needed , and some steep cliff or avalanche track or burnt timber seems to block the way . ''

		The book contains a chapter on camping , also one on game , and one on the
Stony Indians	LOCATION	.

		The volume is a handsome one , finely illustrated with photogravures , and beautifully printed .

		It may be cordially recommended to all lovers of nature .

		THE DIAL 269 Another book on
Canada	LOCATION	is Mr.
E. B. Osborn	PERSON	's '' Greater
Canada	LOCATION	. ''

		This work treats of
British Columbia	ORGANIZATION	,
Alberta	LOCATION	, etc. , from the practical point of view of the farmer and miner ; and it contains also much historical material , not easily found else - where , on the fur trade .

		The author vindicates the great Northwest as a desirable place of residence . ''

		Most people who have not visited the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	firmly believe that a long winter of arctic rigor pre - vents all out-door work during a greater portion of the Northwestern year , and forms an insurmountable ob - stacle to any such growth in the future .

		This fallacy is a chief cause perhaps the chief cause of the preference shown by European emigrants for the States as a field for settlement ; and it is still worked for all it is worth by Yankee emigration agents , whose tales of Canadian climate have caused many new arrivals in
Boston	LOCATION	or
New York	LOCATION	to change their plans and their nationality at the eleventh hour . ''

		However , a page or two later he acknowledges that a temperature of sixty degrees below zero does occur . ''

		At such times the vapor-laden breath from the lungs freezes the moment it leaves the lips , and min - gles with the air , and , falling in the form of infinitesi - mal snow-dust , produces a soft whispering sound a ghostly susurrus , once heard never forgotten . ''

		The woik contains a good map and useful appen - dices , and is certainly a fresh and instructive rSsumS .

		Mr.
Alfred Austin	PERSON	, Poet Laureate , gives us in `` Spring and
Autumn	DATE	in
Ireland	LOCATION	'' a very well written , thoughtful , and altogether charming ac - count of two tours in the
Emerald Isle	LOCATION	.

		He finds nowhere more of natural beauty and human kind - ness , and his characterization of the Irish people is very subtle , sympathetic , and suggestive . ''

		Of course , my experience was limited and imper - fect ; but I found myself remarking , no doubt with a touch of extravagance , that it must be a very dull Englishman who finds Irish people particularly lively .

		Doubtless they are more amiable in the social sense ; but I can not put aside the impression that sadness is the deepest note in the Irish character .

		They remind one of what
Madame de Stael	ORGANIZATION	said of herself , ' Je suis triste , mais gai . '

		Under provocation or stimulus they become both loquacious and merry ; nor need the provocation be very forcible .

		But they readily fall back again into the minor key , and much of their wit springs from their sensibility to the tearfulness of things . '

		You can talk them into anything , ' said one of themselves to me ; and I think it is still more true that they can talk themselves into anything , for the moment at least .

		They are sad , but not serious . ''

		We gain from this booklet more real insight into Irish scenery and life than from many more pre - tentious volumes .

		We notice one blemish in style that is quite ludicrous : '' I could not gaze on the tender sinuousities of the
Wicklow Mountains	LOCATION	, or turn to the Hill of
Howth	LOCATION	, Ire - land 's Eye , and the more distant
Lambay Island	LOCATION	, with - out a sense of rising gladness that I was at last to set foot on a land that greets one with so fair and feminine a face . ''

		Miss
Helen Caddick	PERSON	was the first woman tourist to make the trip to the African
Lake Tanganyika	LOCATION	, and she has described her experiences in a fresh and pleasant little book entitled '' A White Woman in
Central Africa	LOCATION	. ''

		Miss
Caddick	PERSON	travelled alone , transported in a machila a kind of hammock by natives , for more than a thousand miles . ''

		From Domasi I went to see a coffee plantation at
Songani	ORGANIZATION	.

		It seemed to me a rather amusing proceeding to take my machila and my seventeen men about with me wherever I went .

		At first I was troubled as to what would become of them when I stayed a few days at a station ; but I found it was the custom , and no one ob - jected to my arriving with that number of men , and the men themselves were perfectly happy .

		They always took themselves off to the nearest native village , and waited with the most absolute indifference just as long as I wished .

		It was perfectly delightful to meet with beings who had so much spare time . ''

		Miss
Caddick	PERSON	went by the customary routes , and saw only semi-Europeanized
Africa	LOCATION	; but in a bright and amusing way she notes much that would escape the eye of the man traveller .

		The photographic illustrations add to the interest of the book .

		Mr.
Frank G. Carpenter	PERSON	has reproduced in book form , under the title ''
South America	LOCATION	, Social , In - dustrial , and Political , '' the letters on South Amer - ica which have lately appeared in a
Chicago	LOCATION	news - paper .

		While the author deals with social and political life , he is largely concerned with the com - mercial aspect of affairs Bolivian gold and silver mines , Chilian nitrate deposits , Argentine wheat field * , and Brazilian coffee plantations .

		In Monte - video ,
Uruguay	LOCATION	, he found many curious sights . ''

		Men go by us with loads on their heads or on their backs .

		Here comes a milk peddler ; he is of the same style as those of the smaller cities of Argentine Repub - lic .

		He sits on his horse with his legs about its neck and almost on top of the leather buckets that contain his milk cans .

		Each one is corked with a round piece of wood wrapped in a dirty rag , and I doubt whether he changes the rag from one year 's end to the other .

		There he has stopped and gone into the house .

		His horse stands still , although there is no hitching-post or iron ring in sight .

		He has hobbled the front feet of the animal with the whip .

		These men supply the city of more than 250,000 inhabitants with milk .

		They used to supply it with butter , which they made by gal - loping their horses so that the jolting did the churning .

		Then , I am told , when you wanted butter the man dipped his hands into one of the cans and squeezed up a chunk .

		It is still the same outside the cities ; little butter is used by the common people , and there are farmers with thousands of cows who eat dry bread . ''

		Mr.
Carpenter	PERSON	's book , though inevitably superficial , has a general value as a recent sketch of the South American countries , and the illustrations are useful and often striking .

		In the present state of interest in Antarctic dis - covery , the translation of Dr.
Karl Fricker	PERSON	's book on '' The Antarctic Regions '' ought to have attrac - tion for the public .

		This work is a very careful and masterly compilation , giving the history of 270 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, discovery , the geography and geology of the lands , and chapters on climate , ice , fauna and flora , and the future of Antarctic discovery .

		The illustrations are notable , being taken from books of travel and giving correct views of Antarctic scenery .

		The pictures of icebergs are quite the best we have seen .

		The volume contains a valuable map and bibliog - raphy .

		On the whole , we have here a very reliable handbook to the ultima
Thule	LOCATION	of modern explorers , the vast and drear Antarctic .

		BRIEFS ON NBW BOOKS .

		Character and Dr -
Paul	PERSON	S ;
Reinsch	PERSON	might have tendencies of chosen f or his book on '' World Pol - world politics , itics '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- as a suggestive sub-title these words : The Appetite and the Meal .

		In Part I. , on '' National Imperialism , '' there are set forth the rise and characteristics of the appetite ; and in Part II. , on '' The Opening of
China	LOCATION	, '' there is a description of the meal .

		The discussion of the tendencies now to be observed in the policy of all the great states toward aggrandizement at the ex - pense of less civilized or weaker peoples , is like a fresh breeze coming at the end of a sultry day .

		Instead of confusing the subject with sentimental platitudes about destiny , humanity , and the stren - uous tasks of duty , he looks at the facts with some - thing of the directness of a
Machiavelli	ORGANIZATION	.

		Only by such a method can the great change that has come over the ambitions of
Europe	LOCATION	, and , in a measure , of
America	LOCATION	, during the last decade or two , be intelli - gently defined .

		It is significant that the Powers are seeking more carefully to obtain the utmost advantage out of those quasi-possessions upon which they merely have a '' lien . ''

		Dr.
Reinsch	PERSON	has de - scribed in a particularly enlightening manner how this works in
China	LOCATION	; how all the improvements in one district are to be made with German capital , by German engineers , with the use of German ma - chinery , etc. ; and how in another district all these things are to be French , in another Russian , and so on .

		It apparently has again become necessary to revise the Scriptures , so that a familiar passage may more truthfully declare , '' the earth is the white man 's and the fulness thereof . ''

		The failure of the black or brown or yellow man to dig all the coal beneath the surface of his lands , to open his iron or copper or silver or gold mines , to buy European and American goods , is henceforth rightly punishable with bombardment and annexation .

		But Dr.
Reinsch	PERSON	prophetically warned against so treating a great people like the Chinese that their slumbering sense of nationality should be awakened .

		The recent troubles in
China	LOCATION	came as a startling confirmation of his foresight .

		Another significant feature of the present movement is its effect in be - littling important domestic political questions , and in supporting the outcry against intelligent and legitimate dissent .

		This seems to be especially characteristic of
Germany	LOCATION	, and not a little of the
United States	LOCATION	, it might have been added .

		Issue could be taken with minor positions of the author , among others , with his notion that the common endeavor of the Powers to solve the Far Eastern problem may quiet European dissensions .

		This does not seem plausible , if one recalls that a similar movement of expansion four hundred years ago had no such result .

		On the whole , the book is perhaps the sanest discussion of the new Imperialism that has appeared .

		.

		A doctor 's The medical quack , his nostrums and discourse , on methods , is handled , popularly speak - Quackery .

		ing ?

		w i tnout gloves , '' in Dr.
Wm. B. Doherty	PERSON	's blunt and practical little book entitled '' You and Your Doctor '' -LRB-
Laird & Lee	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Dr.
Doherty	PERSON	appears to be not only a '' regular '' physi - cian but a sensible man in the bargain ; and his main aim is to define and specify the quack in all his noxious varieties , and to set forth in plain terms just why quackery is either harmful or else quite inoperative .

		The quack doctor may do you harm ; he certainly will do you no good ; and , in any event , there is his '' little bill '' to be considered for your quack doctor is emphatically '' in medicine '' for the same reason that Mr.
Croker	PERSON	of
Tammany	ORGANIZATION	is `` in politics . ''

		Of the prevalent and direful custom of self-medication , too , Dr.
Doherty	PERSON	has some for - cible things to say ; and it must be admitted that a man consciously turning quack at his own expense , and with no earthly prospect of a fee , presents a singularly fatuous spectacle .

		On its positive side Dr.
Doherty	PERSON	's book offers many useful suggestions as to food , drink , exercise , and the cultivation of health generally ; as to action in sudden emergen - cies of sickness or accident when a physician is not within call , and so on .

		But , thinks Dr.
Doherty	PERSON	, the right thing to do when you are ailing is to con - sult a doctor at once , and be sure that the one you consult is a regular practitioner , and not some twig or other of the great and growing tree of the Quack family .

		This is , of course , all very plain and nat - ural from the standpoint of a physician ; from that of a chronic sufferer who consults one doctor after another with no appreciable result beyond the fur - ther exhaustion of himself and his finances , the matter is by no means so simple .

		We are not sure that doctors themselves are wholly free from re - sponsibility for the existence of the quackery which they deplore .

		The volume is acceptably made , and contains a number of pictures which may serve the purpose of impressing its moral more plainly upon the popular mind .

		Mrs.
Eva Emery Dye	PERSON	calls her ''
McLoughlin	PERSON	and Old Oregon '' -LRB-
A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- a '' chron - icle . ''

		Why not a romance ?

		The book deals with important historical matters , but it is impossible in any strict sense of the word to call it history .

		In proof of this we cite a single passage , which is , however , we are bound to say , the most exaggerated Romance and history of
Old Oregon	ORGANIZATION	.

		1900 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 271 one that we recall .

		It relates to the return of the gold-hunters from
California	LOCATION	to
Oregon	LOCATION	in the early fifties : '' So the Argonauts came home , bringing the Golden Fleece , bags full , tea canisters full , pockets full , of the beautiful shining dust .

		It was weighed like wheat or bran , at
$ 1	MONEY	6 an ounce in trade .

		Men carried gold-dust in pails through the streets .

		Women stored it away in coffee-pots and pickle - jars .

		Milk-pans full of it sat on the shelves .

		Home - comers on horseback threw sacks of it over the fence into the tall grass to lie over night or until they took a bite of supper . ''

		But when once the reader gets the proper point of view , which he will soon do , he will find that the book presents a full and graphic account of American beginnings in
Oregon	LOCATION	.

		Parts of the narrative show real power . ''

		Whitman 's ride '' is made to do duty as a matter of course ; but less is made of it in its bearing on the territorial question than is sometimes done .


Webster	PERSON	's remark that the country owed it to Dr.
Whitman	PERSON	and his associate missionaries that all the territory west of the
Rocky Mountains	LOCATION	north of the
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	was not owned by
England	LOCATION	and held by the
Hudson Bay Company	LOCATION	, if he ever made it , may be true .

		But this is far from proving that the ride had any particular significance so far as the result reached is concerned .

		But we would ask , has not the time come when some competent historical scholar should subject the Whitman tradition to a thorough examination ?

		Mr.
Sidney Whitman	PERSON	's '' Conversa - tions with Prince Bismarck '' -LRB- Har - per -RRB- have been discriminatingly culled from the indefatigable
Herr	PERSON	von Poschinger 's vast -LRB- and still growing -RRB- accumulations of
Bismarck	LOCATION	- iana .

		For a man who did and thought so much , the great Chancellor certainly seems to have talked a great deal unlike his taciturn colleague
Moltke	PERSON	, who , as the saying went , could '' hold his tongue in seven languages . ''

		This toiling Geheimrat , von Poschinger , has constituted himself a sort of post - humous
Boswell	PERSON	to the puissant , if loquacious Chancellor , and has already put forth some half a dozen thick volumes .

		It is from the latest of these that Mr.
Whitman	PERSON	has made his selections .

		The contents of the volume range from grave to gay , and represent
Bismarck	PERSON	at divers periods and in various moods .

		Notable among his interlocutors are Li
Hung Chang	PERSON	,
Thiers	PERSON	,
Favre	PERSON	, Mr.
John Booth	PERSON	-LRB- his neighbor at Friedrichsruh -RRB- ,
Moltke	PERSON	,
Maurus Jokai	PERSON	,
Bluntschli	PERSON	, and so on .

		Talking with
Bluntschli	PERSON	-LRB- 1868 -RRB- ,
Bismarck	PERSON	observed , apropos of
Chamberlain	PERSON	's course in
South Africa	LOCATION	, that while the individual Briton was decent , respectable , and trustworthy , the charge of lying being to him the worst of all charges , English policy , on the other hand , was the reverse of all that ; '' its dominant characteristic was hypocrisy , and it employed every method which the individual Briton despised . ''

		The Turks he rather paradoxically pronounced to be '' the only gentlemen in the
East	LOCATION	'' ; while of his More of the
Conversations of Bismarck	ORGANIZATION	.

		own countrymen he said that they were still a race of non-commissioned officers '' everyone eager to get the stripes . ''

		Mr.
Whitman	PERSON	's book is an excel - lent one for those who wish to get , through as little reading as may be , a fair notion of the quality of
Bismarck	ORGANIZATION	's inimitable talk .

		An Epic Tragedy .

		The episode of Dido , in the Virgilian poem , needs only some rearrange - ment and the omission of explana - tory and descriptive passages to convert it into a play .

		Indeed , while
Virgil	PERSON	is the chief epic poet on the Latin side , an excellent claim may be set up for him as the principal tragic poet of his country .

		The story of Dido , with its singleness of theme and its impetuous rush to its catastrophe , constitutes a tragedy of the classical sort which the Greek writers would have been glad to unfold .

		In the Virgilian epic it rises to a height of interest which perhaps no other part of the poem attains .

		Prof.
Frank I. Miller	PERSON	and Mr.
J. R. Nelson	PERSON	have presented this part of the ^ neid in an English version -LRB- Silver ,
Burdett & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which will no doubt receive the wide attention which it deserves .

		The translation is close , clear , and elegant , and has the advantage over the
William Morris	PERSON	rendering that it is can - didly done into modern and not archaic English .

		The long lines reproduce somewhat the effect of the hexameter , and preserve the dignity and ele - gance of the original .

		The arrangement into scenes has been done with care and skill , and we imagine that it should be effective in an actual performance .

		Some portions have been set to music , for which , we believe , Mr.
Nelson	PERSON	is alone responsible .

		These settings are classical in their character , and are really worthy of the place in which they are found .

		The volume will doubtless make its way into many hands , and students and teachers of the poem will find it a valuable adjunct to the work of appre - ciating and understanding the poem of which it is so important a part .

		on the Western frontier are delight - fully illustrated in the Rev.
Cyrus Townsend Brady	PERSON	's '' Recollections of a Missionary in the Great West '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		It is long since we have seen so many good stories to the page as are to be found in this cheery little repository of quaint clerical experiences .

		In many of them , pathos and fun mingle in pretty even proportions ; and in not a few of them children are the chief actors for Mr.
Brady	PERSON	, like all good men , loves little children .

		A quaint but telling reply was that of the little girl out in Indian Teri-itory a tot of six whom Mr.
Brady	PERSON	had baptized to her teasing schoolmates who wanted to know '' what the man in the
night	TIME	- gown had done to her , and if she was now any dif - ferent from what she was before . ''

		Her theology and her hard words exhausted , she dropped sud - denly into metaphor and the vernacular with 272 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, perfectly satisfactory results : '' Well , I '11 tell you .

		I was a little maverick before , and the man put Jesus 's brand -LSB- the Cross -RSB- on my forehead , and when He sees me running wild on the prairie , He will know that I am His little girl . ''

		Only now and then do the grim features of pain and hardship peep from Mr.
Brady	PERSON	's sunny pages .

		We can only guess that his long struggle in the Far West was in the main a sharp and toilsome one ; for in spirit his book throughout is an unconscious and cheery homily on the useful theme , '' Making the best of it . ''

		The drama * The l atest * ^ e charming `` crepe and theatre paper '' books published by Mr.
T.	PERSON	of
Japan	LOCATION	.

		Hasegawa in
Tokyo	LOCATION	is a large octavo volume entitled '' Scenes du Theatre Japonais . ''

		The greater part of the text is devoted to the most famous of the historical dramas of
Japan	LOCATION	, called from the scene in which the action takes place , `` Terakoya '' -LRB- the village school -RRB- .

		It is translated into French by Dr.
Karl Florenz	PERSON	, professor in the Imperial University of
Tokyo	LOCATION	, who also supplies a brief historical introduction and , at the end of the drama , a short account of the conventions of the Japanese stage .

		The tragedy is in one act and thir - teen scenes in the continental sense of the word and is of an exactness and nicety which suggests that the English may go to the subjects of the Mi - kado for instruction in the art of dramatic writing no less than in the decorative arts in general .

		The translation is from the Japanese into French , and is excellently done , it may be conjectured , the affinity frequently remarked between the genius of
Japan	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	aiding Dr.
Florenz	PERSON	in what is evidently a labor of love .

		But the chief value of the book , nevertheless , may be said to lie in the beautiful drawings in color which have been made for the work by Mr.
Yoshimune Arai	PERSON	, giving it a charm distinctly its own , and doubling its merits in other respects .

		Professor

Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- by adding a somewhat timely chapter on the financial admin - istration of war , illustrated by the experience of the
United States	LOCATION	in the war with
Spain	LOCATION	.

		If the work has been revised in any other respect , the re - vision is of a kind which it would require an expert proof-reader to discover ; yet there are certain in - consistencies in the volume which might easily have been eliminated in a second edition .

		Professor
Plehn	PERSON	is evidently in substantial agreement with Mr.
Wells	PERSON	concerning the general property tax , for he remarks incidentally in his new chapter that '' the method of taxation by which most of the States raise their revenues ... is the worst in use in any civilized country . ''

		Yet in another place he says that the universal condemnation of this tax '' is not due to the defects in the tax itself , but mainly to the fact that it is not properly supple - mented by other taxes . ''

		Barring some defects , the work is a useful text-book in its field .

		`` Plain Printing Types '' is the sub - A mailer printer - ^ of the firgt vo l ume ; n a projected on printing types .

		> .

		r > series of manuals on '' I he Practice of Typography , '' from the pen of Mr.
Theodore L. De Vinne	PERSON	.

		It is a compact and handsomely-printed work , containing minute and detailed descriptions of the tools , technical processes , and various systems of type-making ; specimens and descriptions of all standard sizes of book types ; exhibits of the more important type-faces now commonly in use ; tables of prices of type here and abroad ; and an im - mense amount of similar information heretofore not readily accessible .

		The matter selected for display - ing the various faces and sizes of type is of hardly less interest than the text proper , consisting as it does of short biographies of famous type-founders and designers , historical notes on the development of printing in various countries , sketches of the genesis of well-known type faces , and other matter equally pertinent and valuable .

		To all who have to do with the production of books , Mr.
De Vinne	PERSON	's little treatise must prove indispensable .

		The Cen - tury

		BRIEFER MENTION . ''

		Love 's Comedy '' is the most important of Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	's plays that have hitherto remained untranslated , and we welcome Professor
C. H. Herford	PERSON	's version , now published by the
Charles H. Sergei Co.	PERSON	, both on account of the interest of the work and the excellence of the translation .

		Those who have been fortunate enough to read Professor
Herford	PERSON	's translation of '' Brand '' will not need to be told that in the present instance he has proved himself entirely competent to deal with the metrical and intellectual difficulties of the earlier work .

		Our obligation to him is still further increased by the studied introduction that goes with the volume now at hand .

		The collection of pretty white booklets called the '' What Is Worth While '' series , and published for sev - eral years past by
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, has eleven new numbers for this season , and the covers have a more tasteful design than ever .

		Among the new titles we note the following : `` Spiritual Lessons from the Brownings , '' by Dr.
Amory H. Bradford	PERSON	; `` Books That Nourish Us , '' by Mrs.
Annie Russell Marble	PERSON	; '' Some Ideals in the Education of Women , '' by Miss
Caroline Hazard	PERSON	; '' The Art of Optimism , '' by President
James De Witt Hyde	PERSON	; The Problem of Duty , '' by the Rev.
Charles F. Dole	PERSON	; and '' Good Manners and Suc - cess '' and '' The Hour of Opportunity , '' both by Mr.
Orison Swett Marden	PERSON	.

Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- the author , Mr.
Patterson Du Bois	PERSON	, first states the main idea that his title suggests , and then deals with `` the plane of experience , '' `` applying the principle , '' '' missing the point , '' and '' the lesson ma - terial . ''

		All this is done with admirable clearness and force .

		The book was written originally for
Sunday	DATE	School teachers , but has now been enlarged in scope for other teachers who work on the same level of child life .

		It contains more of the pith of teaching than many a volume far larger and more pretentious .

Edwin A. Grosvenor	PERSON	's important work , `` Con - stantinople , '' which first appeared five years ago .

		The pocket edition of `` Gulliver 's Travels , '' bearing the Dent-Macmillan imprint , is as pretty a book as one often sees , and is made exceptionally attractive by its series of a dozen illustrations , the work of Mr.

		Mr.
Charles Raymond Barrett	PERSON	's treatise on '' Short Story Writing '' appears in a second edition from the press of the
Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is an interesting little book , and may be found useful by beginners in literature , although the art with which it deals is hardly one to be taught .

		These publications are neat pamphlets , illustrated , and are to appear semi-monthly .

		They are priced at ten and
fifteen cents	MONEY	each .

		The small pamphlet of '' Songs for the City of God , '' which Mr.
David Nutt	PERSON	has just published , has a wider scope than most sacred anthologies , and is made notable by the inclusion of poems by
Tennyson , Clough	ORGANIZATION	,
Morris	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Henley	PERSON	, Mr.

Swinburne	PERSON	.

		The judgment displayed in this selection is distinctly out of the ordinary .

		Chaucer and
Burns	PERSON	are now added to their list , each in a boxed two-volume set .

		The Chaucer has facsimiles , a glossary , and an introduction by Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	.

		The

Nathan Haskell Dole	PERSON	.

		The welcome announcement is made that the famous '' Easy Chair '' department of ''
Harper	PERSON	's Magazine '' is to be revived , with Mr.
W. D. Howells	PERSON	as incumbent , than whom it would be hard to suggest a more fitting successor to the genial '' Ik Marvel '' and '' Howadji , '' whose writings have made the '' Easy Chair '' so mem - orable .

		At the same time will be restored the `` Editor 's Study , '' to be conducted by Mr.
Henry Mills Alden	PERSON	, present editor of the Magazine .

		In addition to his '' Easy Chair '' duties , Mr.

		The `` Al = Vista '' ^ : Panoramic Camera Has accomplished the feat of covering in a single expos - ure a scope of about 180 degrees .

		When you consider that this is one-half of the horizon exposed from any given location , the surprising nature of the accom - plishment is realized .

		Two streets running at right angles can now be photographed successfully at one exposure and other equally difficult feats are possible .

		For photographing broad landscapes , mountain ranges , marine views , yacht races , field sports of all kinds in fact , any view spreading over a large area the '' Al - Vista '' does what no other camera ever did or can do .

		Another surprising feature is , that pictures of vary - ing lengths can be made with one camera and on the same roll of film something accomplished by no other Descriptive Catalogue sent free on request .

		\ A7ITH the
November	DATE	number THE CRITIC will begin the publication of a serial story by a writer new to American readers , but who , once introduced , is likely to remain as great a favorite here as he is in his own country .

		The name of this story is a most attractive one : THE FOREST SCHOOLMASTER The Author is
PETER ROSSEGER	PERSON	And the authorized translator from the German original is
FRANCES E. SKINNER	PERSON	.

		While the story of The Forest Schoolmaster deals largely with
Nature	ORGANIZATION	, it is a study of
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's children as found in the far-away forests of
Germany	LOCATION	.

		It is believed to be largely autobiographical ; at any rate , the author has lived among the people of whom he writes , and knows them as no other man could .

		The story is original , powerful , and likely to attract the attention of those who read for something more than mere amusement .

		THE CRITIC 'S readers are to be congratulated upon their good fortune in having this remarkable novel brought to their attention , and we are sure that its development will be eagerly awaited from month to month .

		With its
January	DATE	number THE CRITIC will enter upon its twenty-first year .

CHARLES DUDLEY WARNER	PERSON	.

		The death of
Charles Dudley Warner	PERSON	, on the nineteenth of
October	DATE	, removed a conspic - uous figure from the rapidly-thinning ranks of our older authors , causing heartfelt grief to the thousands of his personal acquaintances and the tens of thousands of his friendly read - ers .

		Among our men of letters , the oldest group now represented among the living is the one which was born in the
third decade of the century	DATE	, and to that group Mr.
Warner	PERSON	belonged .

		It was a notable set of men , for it included among the dead such names as Park - man ,
Curtis	PERSON	,
Boker	PERSON	,
Taylor	PERSON	,
Frothingham	LOCATION	,
White	ORGANIZATION	, Child ,
Winthrop	LOCATION	, Bead ,
Hayne	PERSON	, and
Johnston	PERSON	, and still happily includes among the living the honored names of Dr.
Edward Everett Hale	PERSON	, Mr.
Donald G. Mitchell	PERSON	, Col.
T. W. Higginson	PERSON	, Mr.
Charles G. Leland	PERSON	, Mr.
Richard H. Stoddard	PERSON	, Mr.
Henry C. Lea	PERSON	, Mr.
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	, and Dr.
S. Weir Mitchell	PERSON	.

		With the last-named of these men Mr.
Warner	PERSON	was exactly contemporary , hav - ing
1829	DATE	for the year of his birth .

		Mr.
Warner	PERSON	's long and busy career in - cluded many things besides literature in its activities , and for some time , at least , the pur - suit of letters was rather an incidental occu - pation than a chosen vocation .

		Born in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, he was educated in
New York	LOCATION	, and was graduated from
Hamilton	LOCATION	in
1851	DATE	.

		Meanwhile , he had been a druggist 's assistant and a post-office clerk , and was ambitious to become a Congressman .

		He went to
Missouri	LOCATION	with a surveyor 's party , returned to civilization to study law at the
University of Pennsylva	ORGANIZATION	- nia , and then practiced his profession in Chi - cago .

		Just before the Civil War he was invited to an editorial position by his friend , Mr.
Joseph R. Hawley	PERSON	of the
Hartford	LOCATION	'' Press . ''

		When Mr.
Hawley	PERSON	took the field , his young assistant was left in charge of the paper , which afterwards became merged in the
Hartford	LOCATION	'' Courant , '' with Mr.
Warner	PERSON	as one of the owners .

		This journalistic connection was continued through the rest of his life , although he freed himself from the routine work in his later years .

		Mr.
Warner	PERSON	's graduation from journalism 294 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, into literature may be said to date from the publication , in
1870	DATE	, of '' My Summer in a Garden . ''

		This book consisted of sketches that had been written for the '' Courant , '' and which achieved instant success when they ap - peared in book form .

		Even the English public was won , and the '' Quarterly Review '' said of the book that ''
Charles Lamb	PERSON	might have written it if he had had a garden . ''

		This vol - ume was soon followed by '' Saunterings , '' ' Backlog Studies , '' ''
Baddeck	LOCATION	and That Sort of Thing , '' '' Being a Boy , '' In the
Wilder	PERSON	- ness , '' '' My
Winter	DATE	on the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	, '' and '' In the
Levant	PERSON	, '' all published during the seventies , besides a share in the writing of '' The Gilded Age . ''

		The essay , descriptive or sentimental , had become his favorite form of composition , and he infused into these books no small amount of genial humor and delicate criticism of things and scenes , of men and books .

		At a later period , his essay-writing was done chiefly for ''
Harper	PERSON	's Magazine , '' in whose pages he held monthly discourse for many years the sort of writing which we find in his two small volumes , '' As We Were Say - ing '' and '' As We Go . ''

		As editor of the '' American Men of Letters '' series , he dis - played good judgment in his selection of writ - ers , and himself undertook the biography of
Irving	LOCATION	, which is one of the most satisfactory volumes of the collection .

		He was the nom - inal editor of the '' Library of the World 's Best Literature , '' although his brother , Mr.
George H. Warner	PERSON	, shouldered most of the detail of this editorial undertaking .

		His for - eign travels , illustrated by two titles already given , are still further recorded in the pages of '' A Roundabout Journey , '' but , on the whole , he preferred the investigation of his own country to his European saunterings , and his numerous trips through different regions of the
United States	LOCATION	bore fruit in such books as `` Their Pilgrimage , '' `` On Horseback , '' `` Our
Italy	LOCATION	, '' and `` Studies in the South and West . ''

		Charming as are these many volumes of essays and impressions de voyage , we are in - clined to believe that Mr.
Warner	PERSON	made his most enduring contribution to literature when he wrote , during the last ten years of his life , the series of three novels which provide so suggestive a portrayal of what American life has become in its older centres of civilization , and in these latter days of frenzied commercial - ism and pitiful social ideals .

		`` A Little Journey in the World , '' `` The Golden House , '' and '' That Fortune , '' make up a sort of novel - trilogy which will always have deep interest as a set of social documents , and which comes near to the high - water mark of American fiction .

		There is in these books a riper thought and a deeper humanity than were wont to characterize the author 's earlier writings ; if they are lacking in the quality that goes to the making of the best class of novels , it is because they are essentially the product of the critical rather than of the creative intellect .

		But their mellow optimism , and their persistent exalta - tion of ideals of conduct that have gone too much out of fashion of late years , give these three novels a place all but the highest in our fiction , and set a worthy crown upon the activ - ities of a long and helpful life .

		Mr.
Warner	PERSON	was what is known as a public - spirited man .

		His energies were enlisted in behalf of many good causes , from abolition to prison reform , from the
Egypt	LOCATION	Exploration Fund to the
Park Commission	ORGANIZATION	of his adopted city .

		Many topics of education and social science engaged both his pen and his tongue , for he was a ready public speaker , at once genial and forcible in the presentation of what - ever cause might have enlisted his convictions .

		The city of
Chicago	LOCATION	remembered him as a young lawyer in the fifties , and welcomed him upon his many subsequent visits .

		And the
Twentieth Century Club	ORGANIZATION	of this city is proud of the fact that he was the first speaker to address its members , when it was organized eleven years ago .

		The place which his death has left vacant in our literary life will not easily be filled , and the circles that may know his living presence no more will long hold his personality in affectionate remembrance .

		THE MADISON LIBRARY .

		The capital city of
Wisconsin	LOCATION	was busy , week before last , with a peculiarly interesting celebration .

		The great library building , which has been in process of erection for several years , was formally opened for the use of students , and its dedication to the service of scholarship was signalized by fitting ceremonies , including a masterly address by Mr.
Charles Francis Adams	PERSON	, the chosen guest of the occasion .

		This building , which embodies the most advanced .

		principles of library construction , is the joint property of the
State University	ORGANIZATION	and the
State Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	, and provides suitable shelter for the collections of both institutions collections which comprise in the neighborhood of three hundred thousand bound volumes and pam -
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 295 phlets , exceptionally rich in materials for the study of American history .

		The building itself takes its place in the front rank of what we may call the second group of library structures .

		It is not to be compared for cost or dimensions with the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	, or with the Public Libraries of
Boston	LOCATION	and
Chicago	LOCATION	, or with the great
Public Library	ORGANIZATION	which
New York	LOCATION	will have in due course of time .

		But among university libraries , its position is prob - ably second only to the building which
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	owes to the munificence of its President .

		At all events , it is a noble structure , and its posses - sion may well be a matter of civic pride to the commonwealth which has borne the cost of its erection .

		The special note of the
Madison	PERSON	dedication was historical , and this emphasis is fully justified both by the fact that the department of history is one of the strongest in the
University	ORGANIZATION	, and by the fact that the
State Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	claims about two-thirds of the collection of books now permanently housed .

		We may say further that it was to American his - tory , rather than to history in general , that the building was dedicated , and , if it be not invidious to mention names , that it stands in some measure as a monument to the distinguished services ren - dered to this department of American scholarship by Professor
Frederick J. Turner	PERSON	of the
University	ORGANIZATION	and President
Reuben G. Thwaites	PERSON	of the Histor - ical Society .

		To these men , and to the scholars who , in other centres of learning , have for the past quarter-century been engaged in examining the materials of American history , much gratitude is due ; for they have bestowed upon their subject a dignity in which it was previously lacking , and have made it a new force in the educational and intel - lectual life of our nation .

		TENDENCIES OF AMERICAN LITERATURE Iff THE CLOSING QUARTER OF THE CENTURY .

		Among those who lead the strenuous life which seems to mean strenuously blowing one 's own horn as it has never been done before , at least not since the Jews toppled over the walls of a city with the sounding of their trumpets among these it is easy to award the victor 's crown .

		Superior strenuousness tells instantly , and gets its reward .

		But the contests of literature are not to be decided off-hand .

		Contemporary fame is usually temporary fame ; and a quarter-century is too short a time for forming a safe opinion .

		The contemporary critic , indeed , has a task not unlike that of
Joan D'Arc	PERSON	, when she was brought into the throng of kingly-attired courtiers and bidden distinguish the true king .

		One should be a prophet , or inspired , to attempt the business .

		It is much easier to try to point out some of the tendencies of the literature under review , to show what material it has dealt with , and in what spirit .

		The death of
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	may perhaps be taken as the sign of dismissal of our great literary past .

		He was of the giant race before the flood .

		He was the rear-guard of our
Grand Army	ORGANIZATION	of poets and thinkers which for awhile conquered and possessed the somewhat frozen waste of American life .

		He was the last , or almost the last , of the men of im - agination , and he survived on a good while into the time of the men of fact .

		In one or two of his latest essays , he seems in a rather puzzled way to be trying to get his bearings in the new and alien world around him .

		A few inheritors of the old faith remain Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	, Mr.
Stoddard	PERSON	, Mr.
Aldrich	PERSON	, and Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	; but they have been unable to make head against the powers that thrust even
Lowell	PERSON	into something like literary obscurity in his final years .

		In his essay on Gray ,
Lowell	PERSON	remarks that there was a spiritual east-wind blowing in that writer 's time , under which no poet could flower .

		The
last quarter	DATE	- century in American literature is like a piece of the English eighteenth century dropped into ours .

		There is the same subsidence of passion , the same treatment of imagination as a sort of a poor-relation whom it were dangerous to encourage , the same turning from philosophy to fact .

		The English eighteenth century took long cooling draughts of skepticism and rational Theism , to soothe the fever in its blood and lay the ghosts in its brain .

		We have had the anaconda feast of Evolution to make us lethargic and comfortable .

		Both epochs are notable for the refusal to be bothered with the mysterious and unknown , and for their cheerful facing of the workaday world .

		For religion the intense and possibly selfish passion for saving one 's own soul they both sub - stituted politics and philanthropy the lively interest in keeping alive and directing the bodies of our neighbors .

		Solitude on the mountain heights has seemed to both ages a little ridiculous , and society in the cities more suited to their turn of mind .

		The chief note in eighteenth century literature was humor ; and this is paralleled by our recent work .

		In neither case is it humor of the world - shaking sort , the humor which Socrates must have had in mind when he said that the tragic and comic poet should be one .

		Bather it is the humor of hearty good - sense , of gentle irony , or of almost apologetic satire .

		It has produced the books of that Daily Life which
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	found so insuf - ferable in practice .

		Pope and
Johnson	PERSON	and Gold - smith and
Jane Austen	PERSON	are great apostles of the religion of common-sense the doctrine of houses with roofs to them , and clothes without holes in them , and a working code of morals ; and so , allowing for differences of time and talent , are Mr.
Howells	PERSON	and Mr.
James	PERSON	.

		The literature of common - sense is sound and wholesome enough but it is a trifle obvious .

		We all know that we must work or starve , and that we have got to be toler - ably good or the police will get us .

		Surely the main use of art and literature is to lift man up 296 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, intoxicate him , and make him forget the curse of
Adam	PERSON	.

		We want to be taken out of ourselves or , rather , we want to realize our better selves of which we are conscious ; and so we sympathize far more with the exceptional than with the common - place .

		This natural instinct has been sadly starved by our late literature .

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	has exiled the Exceptional Character from bis novels , and pursued him with fury in his criticism .

		It is a striking tes - timony to his force , that he has compelled us to accept the trivial and uninteresting as important .

		Partly the tendency of the times was with him , partly his unceasing polemic compelled attention , and partly the ease and lightness of his work won conviction .

		He is , indeed , the most easily read author of the day .

		And Mr.
James	PERSON	is the cleverest .

		The mania of cleverness is in him more than in Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	.

		For my part , I never realized that human nature was so complex and subtle , that the average citizen or ordinary baggage in muslin car - ried about with them such immeasurable meaning .

		After puzzling over Mr.
James	PERSON	's hieroglyphics , there is something to be said for the old black-and - white treatment of human nature .

		If these two novelists have been the Cabinet Ministers of our recent literature , Mr.
Bret Harte	PERSON	has been the Leader of the
Opposition	ORGANIZATION	.

		Humor is his characteristic , too ; or else his delight in wild scenes and characters , his ability to mould in the round his hunks of human nature and original sin , might have lifted him to the heights of tragedy or romance .

		Humor is of course the essence of Mr.
Stockton	PERSON	's art , a humor of queer contorted common-sense .

		Mr.
Cable	PERSON	is another humorist , and perhaps the most artistic of all , unless Mr.
Hopkinson Smith	PERSON	matches him .

		This last writer 's ''
Colonel Carter	PERSON	'' is worthy of a place on the shelf with the '' Vicar of Wakefield . ''

		Mr.
Page	PERSON	is a humorist with pathos , and Mr.
Joel Chandler Harris	PERSON	a humorist with pro- fundity .

		Mr.
Chambers	PERSON	is an artist-humorist of exquisite gifts .

		Humor which recurs so persistently in all these writers has become a profession to a legion of others whom it is needless to name .

		Their work is almost the least satisfactory product of American energy .

		It is funny , it is grotesque , it is rib tickling ; but it is , after all , only the supreme effort of the clown with the horse-collar .

		One feels that the dignity of human nature is violated by it .

		A good deal of
Mark Twain	PERSON	's earlier work was of this type , and in fact he might almost be credited with or accused of originating it .

		But the creator of the immortal ''
Tom Sawyer	PERSON	'' and ''
Huckleberry Finn	PERSON	'' has soared far above his imitators , and given us classics of pure delight .

		A
second note of the eighteenth century	DATE	was the predominance of historical writing .

		The greatest history since the ancients , the best biography in the world , and some of the best memoirs , were the product of that time .

		This historic activity is equalled in quantity , if not in quality , in recent American literature .

		Dr.
Fiske	PERSON	, Professor Mc - Master , Mr.
Rhodes	PERSON	, Mr.
Bancroft	PERSON	, and others , have reared monuments of industry and research as im - posing in mass and extent as the pyramids or the Great Wall of
China	LOCATION	.

		I must frankly confess that I have only the slightest acquaintance with these spacious and minute works .

		What knowledge I have of them leads me to think them chronicles rather than histories .

		Their authors give every - thing .

		None of them has the courage and cheerful good heart of
Gibbon	PERSON	, who was capable of saying , '' Nothing important happened in this century , '' or `` The fourth , fifth , and sixth crusades were only repetitions of the first , second , and third . ''

		I am willing to allow our historians every merit in the world save that of felicity of subject .

		Two of
America	LOCATION	's earlier historians ,
Prescott	PERSON	and
Parkman	PERSON	, fell heir to themes which must always thrill and fascinate .

		That so much can be said for the re - corders of our last hundred and fifty years , is more than doubtful .

		America wears
Benjamin Franklin	PERSON	in her disposition ; '' Poor Richard '' has made a continent prosaic .

		It is not that we have lacked great deeds and great men ; on the contrary , it is because we have had a certain level prosperity of luck in both , that single figures and actions are left without relief .

		There is a story of a man who lost his shadow .

		America is in somewhat like case .

		The want of any shading in the popular presenta - tion of the protagonists of our history has long been felt .

		Professor
McMaster	PERSON	a good while ago gave
Franklin	PERSON	a judicious touch of black , and recent memoir writers have eagerly followed suit .

		The Real
Franklin	PERSON	, the Real
Penn	LOCATION	, the Real
Lafayette	LOCATION	, have been presented to us .

		The authors of these studies have cut out and fitted to their heroes the most artistic shadows in graduated tints .

		But somehow they do not seem to succeed .

		One seems still to see the old heroes going about in their pre - vious ghost-like state , and anxiously inquiring of each other , `` Have you seen my shadow lately ? ''

		or , `` Is my halo on straight ? ''

		Absolute uncon - scious delight in human nature in all its manifesta - tions is the first law of creative art .

		Historians are mostly bad artists because they have to praise or blame .

		Possibly our new school of historic ro - mance is to do for American history what Shake - speare and
Scott	PERSON	did for
England	LOCATION	.

		Our recent period again resembles the
eighteenth century	DATE	in its interest in education .

		Cold epochs always believe in education and training .

		When men 's blood is hot with passion , when their brains are flushed with poetry and their lives filled with romance , they can educate themselves .

		The ten - dency of our education has been toward the con - crete , the real , the practical ; we have shunned the abstract and the universal .

		There are not lacking signs that educators see they have gone too far , that they have been training parts of men rather than complete ones , that instead of making each man a world in himself they are making him an insignificant part of the world without .

		We may not get back to the humanities and the categories as a basis of education , but some synthesis will come .

		1900 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 297 Another note of our literature has been disper - sion .

		I might say democracy , but democracy is a queer thing , and comes out where it is least ex - pected , and is missed where it is most looked for .

		There was more democracy in the court of
Louis XIV	ORGANIZATION	.

		than in the rich bourgeois circles of
America	LOCATION	.

		But dispersion the lack of any central authority , of any place of congregation for authors , or any permanent types of humanity for them to repre - sent , has been a very marked feature of our time .

		Every nook of the land has been searched for local color , every dialect has been phonographed , and many of our writers have seemed to think that all that was necessary for originality was a new dislocation of language or a delineation of novel crudity of human nature .

		Humor , historical study , education , and local exploitation , these seem to me the main lines our literature has followed for the
last quarter century	DATE	.

		The note of great poetry has been unsounded , or at least unheard .

		It may be that some of the many claimants to the laurel crown will yet make good their title .

		One of them , indeed ,
Sydney Lanier	PERSON	, has friends who would place him with our best .

		I can - not agree with this estimate .

		There are good lines in `` The Marshes of
Glynn	LOCATION	, '' and some bird-like movements in his lyrics , but nothing extraordinary , and I think it is safe to say that there are twenty contemporary verse-writers who have done more and better in poetry than
Lanier	PERSON	.

		No phrase of his has passed into general circulation no poem of his has haunted the mind of the world ; and he has had no imitators or parodists .

		He has been dead long enough for those phenomena which follow great poetry to appear .

		They have not ap - peared , and I must enter a caveat against his claim .

		His book on '' The Science of English Verse '' is equally unsatisfactory .

		Music and the rhythm of verse are alike subject to the laws of motion or vibration and so is everything else , as far as we can find out ; but that poetry , the most comprehen - sive of the arts , is a sub-species of music , as
Lanier	PERSON	would imply , is a far-fetched fancy .


Rowland Sill	PERSON	's most melancholy and musical verse has great charm ; and some of
Emily Dickinson	PERSON	's rugged rhythms , with their gleams of profound insight and their revelation of a personality almost as strong and strange as
Emily Bronte	PERSON	's , are like to live .

		Good and sound and of excellent workmanship is the great mass of recent American literature ; but as the idealist gazes on it he seems to see the vision of a great strand whereon some tempest has driven a fleet of deeply - laden ships .

		Everything for human needs is strewn about food and raiment , and tools , and precious objects .

		And many of the ships are seaworthy ; but no flood comes and no wind rises to waft them off the sand .

		The agitating power of poetry , the tempestuous stir of great ideas , are wanting to make the fleet march again in tri - umph over the deep .

		There have been times when the things of the mind or soul were dominant in the world and drew all the other affairs of life after them .

		They are certainly not dominant now .

		We are industrial , we are commercial , but we are not religious or artistic .

		Yet we are very well satisfied with our civilization , and are wanting , with our English cousins , to impose it on the rest of the world .

		The rest of the world does not admire it as much as we do .

		The magnificent challenge of the
Boers	ORGANIZATION	to the British Empire , and the stand of our own purchased but recalcitrant Filipino subjects , show that our civilization of industrialism and commercialism is not satisfactory or desirable to those peoples .

		Our civilization of industrialism and commercialism will probably prevail over them .

		It may prevail over the whole of the world .

		But the end of its empire is ennui such ennui as fell upon the Romans when the few ideals of that prosaic race faded and they were left with nothing but their conquests and their riches .

LEONARD MOORE	PERSON	.

		COMMUNICA TION .

		AMERICAN AND ENGLISH POETS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In the current issue of THE DIAL the article based on Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	's '' American Anthology '' evidences such sane appreciation of the highest value of poetry , and such true critical insight , that it seems worth while to call attention to a statement that should not be allowed to go unchallenged . ''

		The twelve greatest English poets , '' the reviewer says , in dwelling on the last hun - dred years of poetical activity , '' are
Keats	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	,
Byron	PERSON	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Coleridge	PERSON	,
Landor	ORGANIZATION	,
Tennyson	LOCATION	,
Browning	PERSON	,
Arnold	LOCATION	,
Rossetti	PERSON	,
Morris	PERSON	, and Mr.
Swin	PERSON	- burne .

		The best dozen of our American poets are probably
Bryant	PERSON	,
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Holmes	PERSON	,
Longfellow	LOCATION	,
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Poe	PERSON	,
Whitman	LOCATION	,
Whittier	LOCATION	,
Lanier	PERSON	,
Taylor	PERSON	, Mr.
Aldrich	PERSON	, and Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	.

		There is obviously little room for comparison between the two groups .

		From the stand - point of disinterested criticism it is hardly too much to say that in absolute value every one of the English group outweighs the best of the American .

		It would require an excess of patriotic zeal to dispute a conclu - sion so obvious to the impartial observer . ''

		This is very positive language , but it is not convincing .

		That our best poets , taken as a class , can not be com - pared with this century 's group of great Englishmen , is indeed undeniable .

		Yet on what grounds does THE DIAL claim a higher place for
Morris	PERSON	than for Poe ?

		or for Arnold than for

		The writer makes manifest his appreciation of the value of the inspiring glow and the genial warmth to be found in the work of our poets who '' warmed both hands before the fire of life , '' with - out being willing to give forth only the cold beauty of a Landor , or the narrow , passionate heat of a Swin - burne ; he shows clearly that in his statement which I have quoted he is thinking of what may be called the '' purely artistic '' side of poetry .

		It seems difficult , in a question of '' absolute value , '' to omit the worth of the idealistic essence with its consequent power of effect , its thrill of inspiration ; but granting the possi - bility of critical appreciation that shall take into account only the '' artistic '' qualities of verse , the question still remains : On what grounds is

Morris	ORGANIZATION	, or
Lowell	LOCATION	to Arnold ?

		One might even add : Does not
Emerson	LOCATION	, in his highest flights of lyric rhap - sody , reach heights to which neither of the English poets whom I have mentioned ever attained ?

		The reviewer in THE DIAL states that his conclusion is obvious to the '' impartial observer . ''

		It may be that that rare and indefinite being , the '' impartial observer , '' whom writers so willingly invoke to attest the truth of their statements , will agree to the suggestion that even a thoughtful and excellent critic is at times led into un - witting depreciation of his country 's poets , through the fear -LRB- perhaps unconscious -RRB- of being misled by '' patriotic zea l - ''

		-LSB- We can have no quarrel with so courteous a critic , nor would we have any essential quarrel were his position more bluntly maintained .

		By selecting the least important of the twelve English poets for comparison with the most important of the twelve Americans , our case is assailed at what is undoubtedly its weakest point .

		The judgment in favor of the transatlantic poets was given delib - erately , for it is a judgment to which we have held for years ; but the inclination of the balance is slight , and in such a case the element of personal opinion , which we always endeavor to exclude as rigorously as possible , may possibly have been the determining factor .

		For the rest , in the two in - stances adduced by our critic the disparity in the volume of good work must be considered in any comparison of Morris with Foe ; and , in a com - parison of Arnold with
Lowell	PERSON	, the purer form and the greater lucidity of expression that characterize the former poet .

		more essentially , of his times and the spirit of his times .

		Governor
Roosevelt	PERSON	has plainly found in
Cromwell	LOCATION	, as a remarkably strenuous char - acter who entered public life at the head of a corps of rough riders , a subject very much to his mind ; and he has treated it with his usual vim and downrightness , and with as much independence of view as a theme already so well canvassed admits of .

		Governor
Roose	PERSON	- velt , while seeing in the Puritanism of Crom - wellian times the dawn of the new order , rather than the sunset of the old -LRB- the `` last glimpse of the Godlike vanishing from this
England	LOCATION	, '' as
Carlyle	PERSON	mournfully put it -RRB- , is nevertheless not quite so sure nor , indeed , are we as some are , that
Oliver	PERSON	himself is to be regarded as the shining herald and morning-star of those free institutions , under which we , in our more sanguine moments , rejoice to think we are living .

		Whether
Cromwell	PERSON	personally did more to advance or to retard those institutions , is a question on both sides of which , as
Sancho Panza	PERSON	used to say , '' much may be said . ''

		At the outset he stood manfully for government by discussion , as opposed to personal rule ; but as his career advanced , and power came to him , grave contradictions appeared ; and as a ruler the one thing that can with absolute cer - tainty be said of him is that he had his own way .

		Any discussion , parliamentary or other , that happened for a moment to block that way was promptly thrust out of it ; and any Hamp - den who '' with dauntless breast '' withstood the proceeding as illegal , was , in effect , promptly extinguished with a gruff '' Leave off your fooling , aud come down , sir ! ''

		as was , in fact , luckless
Parson Hitch	ORGANIZATION	in his pulpit at
Ely	ORGANIZATION	.

		True ,
Cromwell	PERSON	beheaded a king , and prevented Presbyterianism from playing Laud in the realm on its own account ; but he also , without show or pretense of legality , broke up
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	after
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, and , in order to get a Parliament to suit him , out-Tudored the Tudors by setting up one composed of his own nominees a conclave of '' saints '' which signed its own death-warrant the moment it manifested a disposition to act on its own initiative , and without the sanction of its im - perious creator ; he ground
Ireland	LOCATION	under the heel of a system as '' Thorough '' as
Stratford	LOCATION	's ; he hunted down Catholics because they were Catholics ; he trampled on
Scotch Presbytery	LOCATION	; he deprived English Episcopacy of its Prayer - book , and thus drove half
England	LOCATION	to celebrate
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 299 its cherished sacraments by stealth and in secret conventicles a fair reprisal under the lex talionis for the doings of Laud , perhaps , but in no wise an instance of that policy of tolera - tion which he professedly championed , and which he did in fact champion in behalf of such sects as held a doctrine and practiced a ritual which did not shade off too sharply from his own .

		Presbyterians , Anabaptists ,
Millen	PERSON	- narians ,
Fifth Monarchy	ORGANIZATION	men , sectaries of the wilder sorts , all found shelter under the segis of Oliver 's qualified and scrutinizing tolerance ; but woe to the creed in whose ceremonial was to be found a taint of Popish practices the brand of the Scarlet Woman .

		It is customary to regard
Cromwell	PERSON	as the great and triumphant foe of the theory of '' divine right '' ; and such , in a sense , he was .

		But in place of the hereditary divine right of
Charles Stuart	PERSON	he straightway set up the im - mediate divine right of
Oliver Cromwell	PERSON	a notion quite as fatal to popular liberties , gov - ernment by discussion , taxation by consent of the taxables , and the rest of it , as the one it displaced .

		That he was God 's chosen instru - ment for the purification and uplifting of
England	LOCATION	, and that the inward promptings of what he took to be the voice of God had a warrant infinitely superior to any popular mandate that might reach him through the medium of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, was a conviction that grew in intensity with every victory , from
Marston	PERSON	Moor to the '' crowning mercy '' of
Worcester	LOCATION	.

		`` Now let God arise , and His enemies shall be scattered ! ''

		he ejaculated exultingly when the sun rose like a red portent of slaughter over the
North Sea	LOCATION	at
Dunbar	LOCATION	; and it was with the unsparing sword of the Lord of Hosts that he smote the Papists at
Drogheda	LOCATION	and
Wexford	LOCATION	.

		To the fact that
Cromwell	ORGANIZATION	's utterances , even on minor occas - ions , were full , and to the modern sense offen - sively and suspiciously so , of this radical conviction of his , is largely due the long sur - vival of the Clarendonian conception of him as a canting rebel and usurper masking his ambitious designs in a cloak of sanctity .

		The thesis that a man whose speech was full of Scripture , but whose deeds were full of blood and lawlessness , was a hypocrite , was too plausible a one to be easily shaken down .

		But it yielded at last to the genius and research of
Carlyle	PERSON	and the sound sense and firm stroke of
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	.

		Nobody now doubts
Cromwell	PERSON	's sincerity or his patriotism .

		But the reaction has gone far .

		A democratic age , having vindicated
Oliver	PERSON	, must needs see in him not only the sincere man and patriotic statesman who strove unceasingly according to his lights for the glory of God and the good of his country , but the herald and originator of free institutions .

		Cromwell , who cut the knot of every constitutional difficulty with his sword , who denounced a broad suffrage as '' tending very much to anarchy , '' who clapped in the stocks or had shot those who prated of equality , who treated Parliament with con - tumely and its
august	DATE	emblem as a bauble , whose rule , in short , represented in an extreme form the popular bogey personal rule , is now revered as the patron saint of English de - mocracy .

		It is quite possible that , as a recent writer urges ,
Cromwell	PERSON	had a theoretical preference for a representative form of government , and that had he succeeded in getting a
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	always in perfect accord with his views and policy he would have worked smoothly with it , and lived and died to all appearance no more than its first minister and mandatary .

		But this is hardly a safe argument to advance in support of Oliver 's alleged lean - ings to popular rule and government by dis - cussion .

		To act with
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	so long as it agreed with him , and to purge , pack , or dissolve Parliament the moment it disagreed with him , was as characteristic of
Cromwell	PERSON	as it is in - consistent with any just notion of a parlia - mentary ruler .

		The fact is it is idle to try to definitely label and appropriate
Cromwell	PERSON	as the champion of this or that ideal theory of government .

		He did not govern
England	LOCATION	according to some high-sailing maxims about the Rights of Man , but according to his own conclusions as to the deserts and capacities of Englishmen as he saw them .

		He was no ideologist , but a great states - man and soldier , who dealt with questions as they arose , each on its own merits , and whose rule fluctuated in stringency with the needs of the hour .

		Statesmanship was for him a prac - tical business , not a science constructed on the mathematical plan .

		He held the power , and he used it for the ordering and advancement of his country .

		He had , indeed , a programme , of a very practical sort , which he was convinced was the right one , and the one agreeable in the sight of God ; and he was determined to carry it out .

		To that end he seized autocratic power .

		It may be that in the long run his ascendency made for free government and freedom of re - ligious opinion , for he struck down much that 300 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, stood in the way of them ; but that he kept this ideal in view is doubtful .

		That he would have sanctioned a government wholly purged of theocracy , is more than doubtful .

		We may conjecture that were a second
Cromwell	PERSON	to ap - pear in our time , the national imperialism of the day would find in him a formidable and effective chieftain .

		But the effort to define and class him in the interest of some variety of current opinion , or even of historical precision , leads to endless debate and confusion .

		Most current views of him are defensible ; none is unchallengeable .

		As to the essential nature of the work he did , authorities differ radically .

		He destroyed , but he could not build , says one ; he was great as a destroyer , but how much greater as a builder !

		says another .

		His rule , at all events , was that of the sword .

		Yet English democracy sees in him its progenitor and patron saint .

		Mr.
Morley	PERSON	, for his part , has abstained from hard-and-fast generaliza - tions ; for , he says , '' The thirst after broad classifications works havoc with truth ; and to insist upon long series of unqualified clencli - ers in history and biography only ends in confusing ques - tions that are separate , in distorting perspective , in exaggerating proportions , and in falsifying the past for the sake of some spurious edification of the present . ''

		Mr.
Morley	PERSON	's essay is keyed above the tone and spirit of controversy ; and surely the time has gone by for wrangling over the cause , and weeping or rejoicing over the fate of the Stu - arts .

		What is wanted now is the clear sight and the balanced judgment in order that we may come at last to the right historic view of that great drama and its actors .

		To this end , Mr.
Morley	PERSON	's cool and dispassionate pages give valuable aid .

		The keynote of his treatment of the characters of the leaders on both sides is indicated in the following paragraph : '' Just as the historic school has come to an end that despatched
Oliver Cromwell	PERSON	as a hypocrite , so we are escaping from the other school that dismissed
Charles	PERSON	as a tyrant , Laud as a driveller and a bigot , and Went - worth as an apostate . ''

		Mr.
Morley	PERSON	goes on to say : '' That
Wentworth	PERSON	passed over from the popular to the royalist side , and that by the same act he improved his fortunes and exalted his influence , is true .

		But there is no good reason to condemn him of shifting the found - ation of his views of national policy .

		He was never a Puritan , and never a partisan of the supremacy of Par - liament .

		By temperament and conviction he was a firm believer in organized authority ...
Wentworth	LOCATION	's ideal was centered in a strong state , exerting power for the common good ; and the mainspring of a strong state must be a monarch , not Parliament ... That he as - sociated the elevation of his own personality with the triumph of what he took for the right cause , is a weak - ness , if weakness it be , that he shares with some of the most upright reformers that have ever lived .

		It is a chaste ambition if rightly placed , he said at his trial , to have as much power as may be , that there may be power to do the more good in the place where a man lives ... He was devoted to friends , never weary of taking pains for them , thinking nothing too dear for them .

		If he was extremely choleric and impatient , yet it was in a large and imperious way .

		He had energy , baldness , * unsparing industry and attention , long-sigh ted continuity of thought and plan , lofty flight , and as true a concern for order and the public service as
Pym	PERSON	or Oliver or any of them . ''

		Of
Charles	PERSON	's desertion of this faithful ser - vant in his hour of mortal danger , Mr.
Morley	PERSON	says : `` Time has stamped the abandonment of Strafford with an ignominy that can not be washed out . ''

		As to
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's dictum that the act of the English regicides '' did in effect strike a damp-like death through the heart of Flunkyism universally in this world , '' Mr.
Morley	PERSON	observes : '' In fact the very contrary of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's proposition as to death and damp might more fairly be upheld .

		For this at least is certain , that the execution of
Charles I.	PERSON	kindled and nursed for many generations a lasting flame of cant , flunkyism , or whatever else might be the right name of spurious and unmanly sentimentalism , more lively than is associated with any other business in our whole national history . ''

		Discussing the fate of
Charles	LOCATION	, Mr.
Morley	PERSON	says in conclusion : '' The two most sensible things to be said about the trial and execution of
Charles I.	PERSON	have often been said before .

		One is that the proceeding was an act of war , and was just as defensible or just as assailable , and on the same grounds , as the war itself .

		The other remark is that the regicides treated
Charles	PERSON	precisely as
Charles	LOCATION	, if he had won the game , undoubtedly promised himself with law or without law that he would treat them .

		The author of the attempt upon the Five Members in
1642	DATE	was not entitled to plead punctilious demurrers to the revolutionary jurisdiction .

		From the first it had been My head or thy head , and
Charles	PERSON	had lost . ''


Robespierre	LOCATION	, in a rare moment of hard prac - tical insight , at once defined and vindicated in a sentence the execution of
Louis XVI	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was , he said , `` an act of political necessity '' ; and we know of no better apology than that for the course of the earlier regicides who con - trolled or composed
Bradshaw	PERSON	's motley trib - unal . ''

		Stone-dead hath no fellow , '' said
Essex	LOCATION	, in reply to the proposals for merely banishing
Strafford	LOCATION	; and as it was plain to all that there could be no peace for
England	LOCATION	until
Charles	PERSON	was got rid of , it was perhaps for the best that he was got rid of completely and beyond hope of recall .

		Governor
Roosevelt	PERSON	's book is a good , plain narrative , stripped of confusing details , of
Cromwell	ORGANIZATION	's career .

		Much space is given to * As Mr.
Morley	PERSON	's printer prefers to state it .

		THE DIAL 301 military matters , and the political side of the subject is dealt with far more fully than the religious side .

		A striking peculiarity through - out is the frequency of allusion to compara - tively modern names and topics of current or recent interest .

		We think it regrettable that Governor
Roosevelt	PERSON	has seen fit to interpolate in his narrative occasional rather spiteful flings at stock objects of his dislike that unfortunate '' cloistered type '' of his fellow cit - izens , for example , to which he has elsewhere so frequently and forcibly paid his compliments .

		There are in every civilized community men of quiet tastes , who prefer to do what good they can in a quiet and inconspicuous way ; and it is hardly fair to berate them for leaving to others a field for which they feel themselves unfitted .

		The student of public affairs , or the '' closet philosopher , '' to use Governor
Roose	PERSON	- velt 's epithet , may very conceivably serve his country hardly less effectively than the actual participant in them .

		Each of these desirable volumes is well made and sumptuously illustrated .

		THE BEGINNINGS OF A GREAT SCHOOL , .

		* There may be differences of opinion as to the ideal upon which Mr.
Thomas Harrison Montgomery	PERSON	has constructed his '' History of the
University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		It would be strange , for example , if some readers did not think that he might better have omittedsome of the material that he has introduced , as , for instance , in his frequent biographical sketches .

		It is hard to see that
Franklin	PERSON	's electrical re - searches need to be recounted , even in brief , in such a work .

		But there can be no such differences as to the painstaking and laborious conscientiousness with which Mr.
Montgomery	PERSON	has done his work .

		None can dispute that , his plan once formed , he has prosecuted it with great zeal , intelligence , and success .

		The book abounds in detail , the style of composition tends to the ponderous , and the narrative is so heavily weighted with quotations from docu - ments that no one who tries to read it will think the book easy reading .

		It is to a con - siderable extent a collection of original mate - rials .

		history will welcome the volume as a substan - tial contribution to our educational literature .

		The institution that was first known as the Public Academy of the City of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, but is now called the
University of Pennsylva	ORGANIZATION	- nia , was the greatest of the gifts that
Benjamin Franklin	PERSON	made to the city and state of his adoption .

		It had its origin in certain `` Pro- posals Relating to the
Education of Youth	ORGANIZATION	in
Pensilvania	LOCATION	,
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, '' that he printed in his ``
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	Gazette , ''
August 24 , 1749	DATE	.

		That the time for such a movement was ripe was shown by the ready reception that these '' Proposals '' met with , and the immediate steps that were taken to embody them in ac - tion .

		As a place of instruction , the
Academy	ORGANIZATION	opened its doors on the first
Monday	DATE	of Jan - uary ,
1750	DATE	.

		The funds came at first from private subscriptions and the municipal gov - ernment , principally the former ; but after - wards material assistance was received from collections made in
England	LOCATION	.

		The great finan - cial reliance , however , for the period here cov - ered was tuition fees paid by students .

		And still there was a charity school in connection with the Academy , an inheritance that came to the
Board of Trustees	ORGANIZATION	along with the property on which their school was first established , and that constituted a legacy from
Whitfield	ORGANIZATION	's evangelistic labors in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		In
1756	DATE	a college organization was added to the Acad - emy , and nine years later the Medical School , the first one in the country , was founded .

		Few educational words have a fixed connotation , but the author has some reason on his side when he says that the commencement of
1771	DATE	is memorable `` in witnessing the first public claim by the Provost for the institution of the rank and place of a
University	ORGANIZATION	, to which in fact it had attained in
1768	DATE	, and which it has maintained with honor through varying changes and vicissitudes to the present time . ''


June 21	DATE	of that year is the date of the first medical commencement .

		In the order of time ,
Philadelphia	LOCATION	was the sixth of the nine colleges founded in the Thir - teen Colonies before the Revolutionary War .

		It was marked off from those that preceded and those that succeeded it by characters that were peculiarly its own and gave it a special interest as a feature of our collegiate history .

		Three such marks may be noted .

		For one thing ,
Philadelphia	LOCATION	was wholly free from direct ecclesiastical control .

		It bore , of course , the theological marks that belonged to all Christian schools a century and a half ago , 302 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, but it was in no sense subject to church dom - ination .

		The
Board of Trustees	ORGANIZATION	and Faculty were meeting-places for the leading denomina - tions of the city ; but for some reason , which Mr.
Montgomery	PERSON	might have explained more fully , the Episcopalians were more numerous than any other , especially in the
Board	ORGANIZATION	.

		As
Franklin	PERSON	wrote at the time to a correspondent , who was himself an Episcopalian clergyman , '' The Trustees of the Academy are three - fourths of them members of the Church of
England	LOCATION	, and the rest men of moderate prin - ciples . ''

		Still , the property on which the school was first established , for historical reasons , carried a creed in the title-deed : '' We do also give our assent to the 9th , 10th , llth , 12th , 13th , and 17th articles of the
Church of England	ORGANIZATION	, as explained by the Calvinists in their Literal and grammatical sence without any equivocation whatso - ever .

		We mention these in particular because they are a summary of the foregoing articles .

		We believe all that are sound in faith agree in these whatever other points they may differ in . ''

		Here it may not be amiss to remark that two questions which the History of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	suggest have never , to our knowledge , been satisfactorily resolved .

		One is the powerful hold that the Church of
England	LOCATION	early got in the colony , and particularly in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, and the other the extraordinary ease and smoothness with which Friends passed into that communion .

		In view of the origin of the colony , and especially in view of what the Friends had suffered from the Establishment in
England	LOCATION	, both of these facts seem surpris - ing .

		There can , however , be no doubt that the leading members of that communion , rein - forced by the one-fourth of '' men of moderate principles '' of whom
Franklin	PERSON	was easily the first , were the fittest managers of the new school that the colony could furnish .

		The Quakers , for example , were at the time wholly incompetent to found or to take the oversight of a school of liberal learning .

		The second mark of the new institution was an outgrowth of the first one .

		It was less ecclesiastical and more secular than any other anti-revolutionary college .

		In a paper laid before the
Common Council	ORGANIZATION	in
1750	DATE	,
Franklin	PERSON	thus stated the benefits that were expected to flow from the establishment of the school : `` The Benefits expected from this Institution are : That the youth of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	may have an opportu - nity of receiving a good Education at home , and be under no necessity of going abroad for it .

		... That a
Number of Natives	ORGANIZATION	will hereby be qualified to be our Magistracies , and execute other public offices of Trust , with Reputation to themselves and Country ; there being at present great want of Persons so qualified in the several counties of this Province .

		And this is the more necessary now to be provided for by the English here , as vast numbers of Foreigners are yearly imported among us , totally ignorant of our Laws , Customs and Language .

		That a Number of the poorer Sort will hereby be qualified to act as Schoolmasters in the
County	LOCATION	, to teach Children Reading , Writing , Arith - metic , and the Grammar of their Mother Tongue ; ... the County suffering at present very much for want of good School masters .

		... It is thought that a good Academy erected in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, a healthy place where Provisions are plenty , situated in the Center of the Col - onies , may draw Numbers of Students from the neigh - boring Provinces , who must spend considerable Sums yearly among us , in Payment for their Lodging , Diet , Apparel , & c. '' Nothing could well be more secular and prac - tical than this .

		Every word shows the influence of the author 's mind .

		Franklin was indeed of Puritan blood , but this is not Puritan language or the Puritan conception of a school of higher learning .

		To be more definite , while many of the students of the
Academy and College	ORGANIZATION	became ministers of the
Gospel	ORGANIZATION	, the preparation of young men for that calling does not appear to have been a conscious purpose of those who founded it .

		The third point is the very modern character of the institution .

		No doubt this feature is closely connected with those already mentioned , but it deserves separate notice .

		The early documents lay stress upon the modern lan - guages , and especially the English language .

		The '' constitutions '' of
1749	DATE	describe the Academy as a school '' for teaching the Latin and Greek languages , the English tongue gram - matically , and as a language , the most useful living foreign languages , French , German , and Spanish , etc. '' The Trustees were commanded with '' all convenient speed to endeavor to en - gage persons capable of teaching the French , Spanish , and German languages , '' as well as other branches of learning .

		Franklin had ideas as to the way in which English should be taught , ideas that grew out of his own instructive ex - perience .

		He wrote in his '' Proposals '' : '' The English Language might be taught by Gram - mar , in which some of our best Writers , as
Tillotson	PERSON	,
Addison	PERSON	,
Pope	LOCATION	,
Algernon Sidney	PERSON	,
Cato	ORGANIZATION	's Letters , & c. , should be classicks : The
Stiles	PERSON	principally to be culti - vated , being the clear and the concise .

		Reading should also be taught , and pronouncing , properly , distinctly , emphatically ; not with an even Tone , which under - does , nor a theatrical , which over-does Nature . ''

		To form their Stile , they should be put on Writing Letters to each other , making Abstracts of what they read ; or writing the same Things in their own Words ; telling or writing Stories lately read , in their own Ex - pressions .

		All to be revised and corrected by the Tutor , who should give his Reasons , explain the Tone and
Import of Words	ORGANIZATION	, & c.

		The Tutors assisting at the Rehearsals , teaching , advising , correcting their Accent , & c. '' How far this was in advance of the times is well known to students of our colonial educa - tional history .

		Franklin was no doubt the only man in the country at the time who could have conceived such a programme .

		Indeed , the programme was too advanced even for
Philadelphia	LOCATION	; and the failure to realize it , especially in respect to English teaching , was one of the griefs of
Franklin	PERSON	's old age .

		In
1756	DATE	, Dr.
Smith	PERSON	, the Provost , brought out , in connection with the organization of the
College	ORGANIZATION	, the scheme or plan of education that was to be furnished in the schools comprising the
College and Academy	ORGANIZATION	together .

		Our au - thor finds the source of this excellent formula in the curriculum of
King 's College	ORGANIZATION	,
Aberdeen	LOCATION	, where
Provost Smith	ORGANIZATION	had been trained a decade before . ''

		But whencever its origin or concep - tion , '' he says , '' it is the first complete curricu - lum for a college training which any American colony had yet witnessed or recognized , and will stand for all time as the forerunner in all advanced education on these shores . ''

		He de - clares also that it was `` unequalled in any institution in this western country for its com - prehensiveness and thoroughness . ''

		Those who hold briefs for some of the older colleges may possibly dispute this claim .

		A nicer point , however , is the extent to which
Smith	ORGANIZATION	's scheme was actually carried out .

		One who reads the document , which Mr.
Montgomery	PERSON	prints in full , is puzzled to see how a faculty so small as that at
Philadelphia	LOCATION	could have taught all the subjects that the scheme embraced ; and the sceptical will probably think that in some parts this course of study existed merely on paper .

		Students of educational history will regret that in closing this work the author lays down his pen not expecting to resume it , and also will join with him in the hope that another author '' may carry on the history of this Uni - versity family , illustrating its varying misfor - tunes during the Revolutionary struggle , its quiet life through the
first seventy years of this century	DATE	, and portraying with loving strokes its enlarged and influential work of the present generation under the strong stimulus of which it is prepared to enter upon its great career in the twentieth century . ''

		It is to be hoped , how - ever , that Mr.
Montgomery	PERSON	's successor will di - vide his book into regular chapters with appro - priate headings , and that he will also furnish a table of contents .

		GIRLHOOD MEMORIES OF
MADAME ROLAND	ORGANIZATION	.

		* The French Revolution , among its other surprises , conferred immortality on a host of rather commonplace men and women , headed by
Louis XVI	PERSON	.

		Of these it might be said that `` nothing in their life became them like the leaving it . ''

		Dragged into the fierce light that beat about the scaffold , they were converted from advocates , physicians , or provincial abbes , into heroes , patriots , martyrs , of whom their world was not worthy .

		That many high qualities in posse were thus developed , which under other circumstances might have won for their possessors a respectable degree of eminence , is not questioned ; but surely it is the bitter in - iquity of their fate and the exalted courage with which they met it that have saved their names for the reverent admiration of the gen - erations .

		It is at least a \ i open question whether this would have been true of her whom all men know as
Madame Roland	ORGANIZATION	.

		She emerged into public view as the wife of the citizen Minister , and for a few troubled years shared and directed her husband 's counsels .

		When her friends the Girondists succumbed to the Mountain , she too was arrested , on the first of
June , 1793	DATE	, and taken to the Abbaye .

		Released twenty -
four days later	DATE	, she was at once re-arrested and confined in
Sainte Pelagie	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here she wrote her '' Historical Notes '' and her '' Private Memoirs . ''

		On
November	DATE	first she was re - moved to the Conciergerie , and on the eighth she was '' tried , '' sentenced , and led out to ex - ecution .

		As they bound her to the plank , her eyes fell on the colossal statue of Liberty , and she murmured , '' liberte , comme on fajouee '' -LRB- or the more popular variant , '' O liberte , com - bien de crimes on a commis en ton nom '' -RRB- .

		These are the dramatic facts of her closing years , and are known to everybody ; and for the Anglo-Saxon reader they have generally sufficed .

		In the beautiful little volume before us , Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	has turned the page back to the girl - hood memories of
Marie Jeanne Phlipon	PERSON	.

		The translation which is here reprinted in a revised form was made from Bosc 's original edition of the Memoirs , and was published at

		304 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, have not been procurable in an English ver - sion ; it was high time , therefore , for a new edition .

		Nothing in these reminiscences is so im - pressive as the circumstances under which they were written .

		In Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	's words , '' The writer was a prisoner , and under no illusions as to her impending fate .

		Across her path lay in un - mistakable outlines the shadow of the guillotine .

		Her husband and her friends were outlaws , tracked from hiding-place to hiding-place by men in whose eyes clemency was a political crime .

		The trumped-up charge of her own infamy was ringing in the ears of all
Paris	LOCATION	.

		... Her day was done .

		Her stately Plutarchian re - public of wisdom and virtue was sunk in blood and mire . ''

		Thus thrown back on her own thoughts , she took up her pen to recount the story of her life ; and gradually losing herself in the visions of her happy tranquil youth , she described its events with an eager minuteness which repro - duced whole conversations and protracted medi - tations from the shadowy past .

		The flow of reminiscence is at times checked by interrup - tions which would seem appalling to an ordi - nary mind as thus : ''
September 5	DATE	.

		I cut the sheet to inclose what I have written in the little box ; for when I see a revolu - tionary army decreed , new tribunals formed for shed - ding innocent blood , famine threatened , and the tyrants at bay , I augur that they must have new victims , and conclude that no one is secure of living another day . ''

		Or this : '' They interrupt , to inform me that I am compre - hended in
Brissot	LOCATION	's act of accusation , along with many other deputies recently arrested .

		The tyrants are at bay ; they think to fill up the pit open before them , by precipitating worthy people into it ; but they themselves will fall in afterwards .

		... I shall send away this section of my memoir , and prepare to proceed on an - other , if I am permitted . ''

		It is certainly no common young French - woman that looks out upon us from these pages .

		With engaging candor , and a self-consciousness scarce reached again in print until
Marie Bash	PERSON	- kirtseff , she casts up the account of her youth - ful charms of person and intellect , and finds the sum - total '' all very good '' : '' As to my face , there was nothing in it specially striking of itself , save perhaps the fresh color , the tenderness and expression .

		To go into details , ' Where , ' it may be asked , is the beauty ? '

		Not a feature is regular , but all please .

		The mouth is rather large one sees a thousand that are prettier ; but where is there a smile more sweet and engaging ?

		The eye is scarcely large enough , and its iris is of a grayish hue ; but , though somewhat prominently set , it is frank , lively , and tender , crowned by delicately penciled brown eyebrows -LRB- the color of my hair -RRB- , and its expression varies with the changing emotions of the soul whose activity it reflects ; grave and haughty , at times it im - poses ; but it charms oftener , and is always animated . ''

		Far and faint indeed seems the cry from this student of her mirror to `` Plutarch 's woman , '' '' the Egeria of the Girondins . ''

		Her father ,
Gatien Phlipon	PERSON	, an engraver by occupation , is described with no filial illu - sions : '' Strong and healthy , active and vain , he loved his wife , and was fond of dress .

		Without learning , he had that degree of taste and knowledge which the fine arts give superficially , in whatever branch they are prac - tised ... He led a regular life , while his ambition was not unbridled , or had experienced no disappoint - ments .

		He could not be said to be a virtuous man , but he had a great deal of what is called honor . ''

		On the other hand , her mother 's presence , ever gentle and sympathetic , pervades the whole narrative ; and we can readily realize the passionate devotion with which this proud and high-strung girl clung to the parent who seemed to understand her .

		This was her trib - ute to her mother 's memory : '' Thus was taken from the world one of the gentlest , most lovable beings that ever graced it .

		Her qualities were not brilliant , but they were such as won and re - tained the love of all who knew her .

		Naturally pure and just , her virtues were the fruit of impulse , not effort .

		Prudent and self-poised , tender without passion , her tranquil spirit lived its days as flows some quiet stream that laves with equal complaisance the rock that holds it captive and the valley it embellishes . ''

		The little
Marie	PERSON	's impressible nature was deeply affected by her first communion ; but soon her faith began to disintegrate , under doubts as to eternal damnation and the infal - libility of the Church ; and she , with thousands of others , was left in philosophic recognition of a
First Cause	ORGANIZATION	, a
Supreme Intelligence	ORGANIZATION	, to whom she could address this petition , in which we find something more than philosophy : '' O Thou who hast placed me on the earth , enable me to fill my destination in the manner most conform - able to Thy divine will , and most beneficial to the welfare of my brethren of mankind . ''

		As she grew to womanhood , this fair young bourgeoise with the dark and eloquent eyes was pestered by almost as many suitors as the discreet
Penelope	PERSON	; and the tracing of their successive advances and dismissals must have brought a faint smile even to those prison - blanched lips in
Sainte Pelagic	LOCATION	.

		It is with considerable humor that she tells how she managed to escape a butcher , an advocate , a physician , and several other dim wooers men - tioned only en bloc .

		At length , in
1779	DATE	, at the age of twenty-five , she accepted the hand of
M. Roland de la Platiere	ORGANIZATION	, who was forty - seven .

		From this time till her death her life was more or less a public one , and she became the
Madame Roland	ORGANIZATION	of history .

		1900 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 305 Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	has edited the book with good taste and literary skill .

		In an introduction of some twenty pages , he rounds out the story of
Madame Roland	ORGANIZATION	's life by tracing in outline her public career , imprisonment , and execution ; and adds a well-written and impartial estimate of her character .

		He admits that she was '' No stranger to the sentiments of her class .

		How keenly she resented the distinctions of birth that blocked the path and galled the pride of the educated and prosperous commoner of the eighteenth century , her memoirs too bitterly attest .

		To this alloy of jaundiced class feeling , joined to a certain native hard - ness and implacability of temper , must be ascribed what is palpably impolitic and ungenerous in the con - duct of Madame Roland . ''

		Per contra , he adds : '' But whatever her blemishes may have been ,
Madame Roland	PERSON	is still the heroine of the Revolution .

		It is to her that the eye instinctively turns for a type and symbol of the earlier and finer characteristics of that movement , its quasi-religious enthusiasm , its broad philanthropy , its passion for liberty and social justice , its faith in the original goodness and ultimate high destiny of man . ''

		The book is creditably printed , and contains about a dozen interesting portraits ; together with pictures of the Abbaye , the Conciergerie , the parks of
Meudon	LOCATION	and
Versailles	LOCATION	, etc. .

		The abiding interest of the subject and the attrac - tiveness with which it is presented should make this translation a permanently-useful addition to the literature of the Revolution .

		A BRIEF HISTORY OF EASTERN ASIA .

I. C. Hannah	PERSON	,
M.A. New York	LOCATION	:
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		know little about
America	LOCATION	, and care less ; and this indifference is heartily reciprocated .

		Lack of common interests is the chief cause of this .

		Neither country realizes that both are democracies , with a strong tendency toward something different in the high places , de - mocracies with the people heavily taxed for the maintenance of an office-holding class which is usually held in contempt , and democracies with the teachings of the religion of the country at open variance with its performance .

		These common national tendencies may be traced in the small library of books which have been rushed into print to give the English-speaking people some much needed and highly bewilder - ing information concerning the Chinese people .

		It is also manifest though none of the various writers has taken pains to call attention to it that the utter lack of real comprehension of the yellow race by the white implies and in - cludes an utter lack of real comprehension of the white race by the yellow .

		A realization of the fact that everything which we think about the Chinese unfavorable to their morals and civilization stands for a precisely similar thought in the Chinese intellect in respect to our morals and civilization , would do marvels toward making the situation comprehensible among the Caucasians .

		Nor do they suffer one whit more by the comparison in our eyes than do we in theirs .

		Half the despatches from
China	LOCATION	and
Europe	LOCATION	, since the present fighting-peace or peaceful - war began , inform the American people that
Russia	LOCATION	has annexed , is annexing , or is about to annex ,
Manchuria	LOCATION	.

		Yet Mr.
Archibald R. Colquhoun	PERSON	, in his ''
Russia Against India	LOCATION	, '' says that
Manchuria	LOCATION	fell into Russian hands long before the Boxers began using their fists .

		For the most part , his book is taken up , not with the menace to British influence in
China	LOCATION	by Russian aggression and the advancement of her frontier , but with the menace to the peace of
India	LOCATION	and so of all
Europe	LOCATION	which lies back of
Russia	LOCATION	's advance in central
Asia	LOCATION	.

		Besides describing the peoples now coming under the rule of the Tsar , Mr.
Colquhoun	PERSON	points out that
India	LOCATION	is growing worse governed under the British bureaucracy , rather than better , and utters a warning accordingly .

		Mr.
Robert E. Speer	PERSON	republishes a chapter or two from his larger book on '' Missions and Politics in
China	LOCATION	'' under the title '' The Situ - ation in
China	LOCATION	, '' and his contribution is timely , if not new .

		He sums up the good there is in the Chinese character , not less than the evil , 306 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, and makes plain that the fault lies largely with the European governments , which treat the Chinese government , now as civilized and now as barbarian , with neither consistency nor justice .


Europe	LOCATION	, by placing missions and mer - chants on equal terms in their diplomatic deal - ings with Chinese officials , does incalculable harm to the Christian cause .

		Yet he states that much of '' the spirit of our Western peoples ... as displayed in dealings with
Oriental Nations	ORGANIZATION	from
Turkey	LOCATION	to
China	LOCATION	, is as a foul stench in our nostrils . ''

		The corollary of this would seem to be that
Christendom	LOCATION	might better be christianizing itself than seeking to christianize a people to whom its practices are hopelessly irreconcilable with its professions :
Germany	LOCATION	, for example , gobbling a province in
China	LOCATION	because two followers of Jesus have there been crowned with the palm of mar - tyrdom . ''

		The Crisis in
China	LOCATION	'' is a symposium from the '' North American Review '' put into book form .

		It contains as many authoritative state - ments of the different phases of the general subject of
China	LOCATION	as could be gathered together in the time permitted , all of them pertinent and some of them worthy of careful study .

		Mr.
Colquhoun	PERSON	appears again , in a paper on the crisis , curiously frank , and certain to throw light on many things besides his subject .

		He shows that such a democracy as
England	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	possess is of little signifi - cance when the question of land-grabbing in
China	LOCATION	comes up , in spite of their land-grab - bing exploits when free from international competition .

		`` While the rulers of
Eussia	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and even
Belgium	LOCATION	, have been heading national crusades of productive enterprise in
China	LOCATION	, the governments of
Great Britain	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	have held aloof , and allowed rights and claims to be established to their perpetual exclusion and detriment . ''

		This is the proof of his statement that '' we have seen the superiority , in certain spheres of competition , of governments which lead their people , over those of people who lead their governments . ''

		So true is it that En - gland and
America	LOCATION	have been taken up into the high places of the earth and shown the kingdoms thereof .

		Space does not avail even for a specification of the articles in the book , but its value is manifest at the present time .

		Mr.
Rounsevelle Wildman	PERSON	, our consul gen - eral at
Hong Kong	LOCATION	, has prepared a book on ``
China	LOCATION	's Open Door . ''

		Mr.
Charles Denby	PERSON	, formerly our minister to
China	LOCATION	, writes an in - troduction , from which may be gleaned the knowledge that here is almost , if not quite , the greatest book ever written by anyone on any subject .

		Mr.
Wildman	PERSON	writes within his knowledge respecting trade and certain events in recent history ; but the attempt to tell too much within the space defeats itself .

		A habit of dogmatic assertion and utter lack of sym - pathy for the Chinese are serious faults run - ning through its pages , and the tone of the book is low .

		An index is lacking .

		In less than three hundred pages , Mr.
I. C. Hannah	PERSON	undertakes to tell the '' History of
Eastern Asia	LOCATION	'' all that part of the continent , , that is , which is not immediately concerned in European history .

		The work deals more with the past than the present , and the amount of space covered leaves it an unsatisfactory achieve - ment .

		Yet the book contains an astonishing amount of information , and takes a place of its own as an abridgement of the more ponderous histories preceding it .

		THE DIAL 307 an intellectual freedom which impels him to reject the dogmatism of the official theology , and leads him to martyrdom in the end .

		Many historical characters besides that of the King move in these pages , the most conspicuous among them being the captive Princess
Eleanor of Brittany	PERSON	, to whom the hero becomes father-confessor , friend , and unavowed lover .

		The most noteworthy feature of this work is found in the writer 's conception of
John	PERSON	, and in her view of the struggle between
King	ORGANIZATION	and Pope which placed
England	LOCATION	under the Interdict , and led to the submission of the royal to the papal will .

		Miss
Potter	PERSON	is not without some warrant for her view , although the majority of historical scholars still incline to the traditional opinion .

		That
John	PERSON	was such a monster as to defile hell itself with his presence may perhaps be taken as the exaggeration of a vindictive monkish chronicler , but it is never - theless a little startling to have him presented to us as the champion of English liberties , and , on the other hand , to have
Stephen Langton	PERSON	presented to us as the base tool of an unscrupulous foreign op - pressor .

		Miss
Potter	PERSON	has not been content with the superficial preparation that most writers of his - torical fiction think sufficient for their purpose ; she has instead made a careful and minute study of her period , and accumulated a really remarkable store of information respecting the political history of the time , its manners and customs , and particu - larly the conditions of monastic life .

		The chief defect of '' Uncanonized '' is that this material is too much in evidence , for many passages of the book are out of place in a work of fiction , however admirably they would serve the purposes of an essay .

		She has got possession of the facts in great quantity , she has even arranged them until they are seen in their proper perspective , but she has not succeeded in rejecting those that are irrelevant to her design .

		We note this with regret , for her book is in many respects far superior to the run of this sort of fiction ; it is serious work , and deserves to be treated seriously .

		The simple truth is that the narrative is so clogged by extraneous matter that there is no freedom of motion left it .

		As a romance , it drags , and does not reach effective dramatic cli - maxes .

		If the writer could have devised a few striking situations , and infused more external ex - citement into her work , she would have made it one of the most remarkable romances of its kind .

		As it is , she has produced a book that commands respect , and that gives much promise for the future .

		What we have just said about Miss
Potter	PERSON	's ro - mance may be illustrated by contrasting the work with such a romance as Miss
Nixon	PERSON	's '' God , the
King	PERSON	, My Brother , '' which has precisely the element of action in which '' Uncanonized '' is deficient .

		Here is a story that we remember for a while , at least as a story , and yet it is thin and superficial in every important respect .

		It is not the product of one-tenth the thought and industrious study that have gone to the making of '' Uncanonized '' ; it seems the merest romantic trifling when compared with the other book .

		But it does display the story - teller 's gift , and does not constantly disappoint us when we approach what bids fair to be a climax .

		For the rest , it is a tale of the Court of
Castile	LOCATION	in the fourteenth century , the time of Pedro the Cruel and the
Black Prince	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is a persecuted maiden , a Spanish villain , and two English squires who thwart the villain and rescue the heroine .

		There are duels and ambuscades and perilous ad - ventures in rapid succession , and there is not a trace of the true historical atmosphere .


John Paul Jones	PERSON	is an excellent hero to use for the purposes of historical fiction , but we fear that Dr.
Brady	PERSON	is in danger of working him too hard . ''

		The Grip of Honor '' is the third of this talented writer 's books , and has the wholesome manliness of tone which distinguished its two predecessors .

		But it is so closely like them in other respects as well that we have read it with some sense of disappoint - ment .

		The author 's vein of mingled patriotism and romantic sentiment seems to be a thin one , although the ore is genuine .

		The description of the fight be - tween the
Bonhomme Richard	PERSON	and the Serapis is certainly thrilling enough to repay the reader for any annoyance by the way .

		The romance of the
American Revolution	ORGANIZATION	seems to be in great favor at the present time , and we are glad that Mr.
R. N. Stephens	PERSON	has taken a hand in it .

		His ''
Philip Winwood	PERSON	, '' while not a work of the finish or breadth of view that we find in such books as u
Hugh Wynne	PERSON	'' and ''
Richard Carvel	PERSON	'' and ``
Janice Meredith	PERSON	, '' is nevertheless a thoroughly pleasing performance , graceful in diction and in sentiment .

		It is the biography of an American soldier written by a royalist friend , and touches upon the whole course of the war , although its in - terest is primarily domestic .

		Mr.
Joseph A. Altsheler	PERSON	's '' In Circling Camps '' is a story of the Civil War much above the average .

		The author has shown his skill in dealing with our two wars with
England	LOCATION	, and it does not desert him when he comes down into the modern period of our history .

		From a military point of view , the story has for its climax the fight at
Gettysburg	LOCATION	, which is described in the most vivid colors .

		Equal in its way is the earlier description of the defeat , afterwards turned into a victory , of
Shiloh	LOCATION	.

		The private interest is supplied by a young woman for whose hand two officers one Federal and one Confederate are rivals .

		How the former wins her , and escapes with her from under the very nose of his enemy , is a story told with much ingenuity .

		The sympathies of the book , while turning in favor of the North , do not a little to make us understand and admire the devotion and the heroism that did such desperate deeds in behalf of the cause that was foredoomed from the outset .

		As a master of the novel in which romantic or sentimental incident forms the chief source of inter - est , Mr.
Egerton Castle	PERSON	is probably unsurpassed by any of his contemporaries .

		And if we set aside Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	and Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	, as being obviously 308 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, hors concours , we should hesitate to designate as his superior any other living English writer of fiction .

		It is only a few years since this brilliant novelist appeared upon the horizon , and already his work challenges comparison with all but the best we have .

		His new novel , entitled '' Consequences , '' although less romantic in setting than '' The Light of Scar - they , '' is fully as interesting , and readers will be glad to know that it is also fully as long .

		The plot is somewhat threadbare , being that of the man who , becoming involved in a tangle of difficulties , finds a way out by means of a pretended suicide , and begins life over again under a new name .

		As is usually the case , the consequences of this act pur - sue the actor , and in the present instance prove so fateful that the author could have found no better title for his book than that one word .

		But Mr.
Castle	PERSON	's stories , as such , are uot ^ articularly remark - able ; what is remarkable about his books is the charm of their diction , the richly observant mind which they reveal , the fine sense of relations and proportions which they illustrate , and the true ring of their sympathies .

		In all these respects , `` Con - sequences '' is a noteworthy novel , and , for readers intent upon entertainment , will prove a source of unalloyed pleasure .

		Those who followed the boyhood years of `` Sen - timental Tommy '' with delight in the conception of his character , and amusement at the inventions of his precocious imagination , have been awaiting with considerable eagerness the story of his later career as a famous writer .

		Some , impatient of the delay , have had resort to the last device of the des - perate impatient , and have been taking ''
Tommy	PERSON	and Grizel '' on the plan of monthly instalments .

		We , having awaited the book itself , must now con - fess to the disappointment which it has occasioned us .

		It opens attractively enough , and for a few chapters seems to promise a sustention of the old charm ; but after awhile the writer 's invention fails him , he resorts to more and more questionable expedients to keep the story going , and we are loath to make the statement
Tommy	PERSON	becomes distinctly tiresome .

		We do not mourn his demise when the author gets through with his biography , and are inclined to congratulate Grizel upon having made a good riddance .

		The simple fact is that
Tommy	PERSON	's imagination assumes a development that is positively diseased , and the balance of faculty that we naturally expected would come to him with maturity is nowise attained .

		Considered even as a child of genius he does things that are inexplicable upon any rational theory , and his vagaries , ceasing to illustrate any consistent conception of character , become as whimsical as those in which Mr.
Stockton	PERSON	, for example , finds his account .

		The book is a melancholy illustration of the danger that lies in writing sequels .

		`` The West End , '' by Mr.
Percy White	PERSON	, is a novel of English society , written by one who is thoroughly conversant with the life of the '' classes , '' but who does not take that life too seriously , and contrives to tell a story of real human interest .

		The narrative is in the first person , the narrator being a dependent relative of the wealthy parvenu whose family affairs provide the subject-matter .

		Installed in this household as a sort of private sec - retary , his shrewd intelligence makes him indispens - able to the several members of the family , and his diplomacy is successful in dealing with one critical situation after another .

		His inquisitiveness and double-dealing are not altogether admirable from the standpoint of the strictest ethics , but he keeps in the good graces of all concerned , and brings to a satisfactory issue the matters with which he is mixed up .

		The light satirical touch of the author enlivens many a chapter of the book , and is slightly suggestive of the manner of Cherbuliez .

		We have thought of '' Le Secret du Prdcepteur '' more than once during the perusal , which is no mean praise for this enter - taining story .

		Mr.
Clive Holland	PERSON	's ''
Marcelle	PERSON	of the Quarter '' is a slight story of the Pays latin and the life of models and studios .

		The charming heroine is a child left an orphan by the death of the model who gave her birth , and adopted by a rising young English artist .

		She grows up to be a beautiful woman , and her protector discovers that he lovea her otherwise than as an adopted father .

		The usual young man then appears upon the scene , and seeks to win her , but in this case , contrary to the usual pathetic tradition , she prefers to cling to her elderly lover , with whom she is in the end happily married .

		The story is pleasingly told , and is free from the impure suggestiveness we are apt to asso - ciate with the sort of life which it describes . ''

		The Dishonor of
Frank Scott	PERSON	, '' by
Miss M. Hamilton	PERSON	, is a story told in so winning a fashion that we are half inclined to excuse the disagreeable , if not impossible , character of its theme .

		A hero in whom there is nothing that can possibly be ad - mired is a pretty serious handicap to a work of fiction , and it takes some art to interest us in such a person at all .

		We certainly do get interested in
Frank Scott	LOCATION	, although he becomes a bigamist with his eyes open , bringing shame and misery upon the two women who are attracted by his worthless per - son , and , were his crime any less despicable than it is , we might feel a certain sympathy for him .

		The writer clearly intends that we should , which consti - tutes the fatal blot upon her work .

		The scene is laid in
British India	LOCATION	, and shows some familiarity with local conditions as far as they affect the life of the English resident .

		The story of '' My New Curate , '' by the Kev .


P. A. Sheehan	PERSON	, has little of the ordinary interest of a work of fiction , but it is better worth reading than nine novels out of ten .

		There is no love-story , except for an episode of subordinate inportance , and there is nothing in the way of plot , or intrigue , or adventure .

		Just the humble annals of an Irish sea-coast hamlet , related by the parish priest , and concerned with the simple incidents of his daily ministrations these , and nothing more , are offered

		THE DIAL 309 us by this unpretentious book .

		Its appeal is made to us by force of sheer humanity , and by the grace of the writer 's gentle and unaffected piety .

		Our sympathies are enlisted from the start , and we fol - low with unflagging interest the fortunes of this servant of God , this genial old-fashioned scholar and priest , as , with the aid of his impetuous and enthusiastic '' new curate , '' he labors for the spirit - ual welfare of his flock .

		There is something too much of ceremonial and of theological disputation for the best interests of the book , but this we are willing to accept for the sake of its humor , its steadfast devotion to the life of the spirit , and its human characterization .

		It is the sort of book that leaves a pleasant taste , and is closed with reluctance .

		There is something of the same element of simple humanity , of sympathy for our humble fellow-men , and of the disposition to discern the soul of good in things evil , about `` The Alabaster Box , '' Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	's latest novel .

		Here we have for our scene , not an Irish parish , but a
London	LOCATION	slum , and for a theme the work of one of those philan - thropic settlements that have already done so much toward pointing the way for an effective social re - form .

		The title of the story is symbolical of the devotion that is satisfied with nothing less than the gift of self not merely of one 's time or means to the cause of suffering humanity .

		Nothing can be too precious for that sacrifice , any more than the scriptural box of ointment was too precious for its predestined purpose .

		This simple story , which is like the one previously mentioned in its entire lack of the elements from which ordinary fiction derives its interest , is concerned wholly with the determi - nation of a young man , the heir of an ill-gotten fortune , to atone for the wrongs by which that for - tune had been amassed , and restore to society what bad been wrested from it by the cunning and harsh practices of his father .

		There is no touch of maudlin sentimentality about the treatment of this theme ; the problem is dealt with in a manly and courageous fashion , and the outcome is ethically satisfactory .

		WILLIAM
MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		It is perhaps not unusual for a man iSt0ry of letters to be tempted from his accustomed domain into historical writing .

		Like
Carlyle	PERSON	,
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	, and many others , Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	has shown his versatility in a new light by bringing out a volume of serious his - tory .

		The first volume of his '' History of Scot - land '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has not the excuse of passionate inspiration which explained
Carlyle	PERSON	's account of the French Revolution ; neither is it , nor is it intended to be , the masterpiece of literary history which
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's laborious effort resulted in .

		The raison d'etre can only be found in Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's love for his home people , and his interest in their romantic past .

		The volume is nevertheless history in its best sense , written with all the sym - pathy of an enthusiast , with all the thoroughness of a scholar , and with the truthful impartiality of the historian .

		Indeed , while the book bears evidence of careful investigation into ancient documents and manuscripts , the reader 's most lasting impression is of Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's desire to be absolutely fair and just in his conclusions .

		Of course there are many times when the historian 's careful examination shatters some ideal of Scottish romance , yet with apparent unwillingness and regret .

		The truth will out , how - ever , as when the author finds himself compelled to state the barbarities of
Wallace	LOCATION	, or the many treacheries of
Robert Bruce	PERSON	in his earlier days .

		The book is by no means easy reading .

		This does not arise from any mustiness of ideas or of facts , but rather because of the multiplicity of details in - corporated into the history .

		Yet as one reads on and becomes accustomed to the method pursued , this difficulty gradually disappears .

		In spite of the detailed method of statement , there has been created for the Scottish people , and for each period , an atmosphere in which men and events are seen with true and clear vision .

		This is the best feature of the book , and one attempted by most historians only in the form of separate and didactic statement .

		Here it is not stated at all , but it is woven , with fine technique , into the web of story .

		Details soon pass from the memory ; but a knowledge of the temper and characteristics of the Scottish people will re - main to all readers of this history .

		Volume I. covers the period from the Roman occupation to the murder of Cardinal
Beaton	PERSON	.

		Domestic life in The popularity of a certain order of
New England	LOCATION	in books on our colonial period reflects the isth century .

		tne crav j n g o f a new nation for a historic past .

		Wealth and power , and the prestige that belong to them , we have beyond dispute .

		We like , also , to think that we have a remote heroic age peculiarly our own and the source of our na - tional traits and virtues .

		So , somewhat to the amusement of an old world , with its hoary tradi - tions of feudal and mediaeval times when even royalty was an innovator , we point proudly to the day before yesterday as to our golden antiquity , among the relics and muniments of which antiqua - rians and geologists may delve .

		The researches of genealogy have , in particular , been richly rewarded of late ; and the American of English descent , and with a liking for '' blood , '' who can not boast of a colonial or Revolutionary ancestor or two is poor indeed .

		Carping foreigners and satirical citizens at home make merry over our new aristocracy of birth , and meanly point out , among other things , that the modern amended passenger list of the '' Mayflower '' would rather tax the carrying ca - pacity of the '' Great Eastern . ''

		But we are a great nation , and must have all the appanages of greatness , a class of Eupatrids among the rest .

		Not a few of the books of which we started out to speak are
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	, -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, largely the expression , however , of the scholarly instinct , and are of no little real value in bringing to light and preserving records of bygone days which future historians must paint .

		The little vol - ume before us entitled `` The Salt-Box House '' -LRB-
Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mrs.
Jane de Forest Shelton	PERSON	, is one of these books ; and its purpose is to portray domestic life in a typical western
New England	LOCATION	town of the eighteenth century .

		The narrative is compiled largely from private papers , and is tinged with a tender and regretful sentiment for the past , which is evidently genuine .

		The scene is laid in the portion of the old
Connecticut	LOCATION	town of
Stratford	LOCATION	, which was once called Bipton ; and the family whose fortunes are chronicled and whose home life is painted belonged to the better class of the day and district .

		The manage of the '' Salt - Box House '' was certainly simple enough .

		An excellent biography of
Paul Jones	PERSON	.

		A glamor of mystery has long en - shrouded the figure of
Paul Jones	PERSON	.

		The sketches and biographies of him that have hitherto appeared , leaving much to con - jecture , have served to intensify rather than to dispel it ; and thus we have come to picture this intrepid and gifted free-lance of the ocean , not so much as a perfectly realizable and relatively mod - ern historical character , as a heroic half-mythical figure fixed on the quarter-deck of the '' Ranger '' or the ''
Bon Homme Richard	PERSON	, '' wrapped in the smoke of battle .

		Material enough , however , has always existed for an authentic and fairly circum - stantial life of Jones , that should leave untouched no essential phase of his strangely varied and roman - tic though somewhat brief career .

		But the material has been scattered , and much of it not easy of ac - cess ; and the use that has heretofore been made of it has been most unsatisfactory , wherever an effort was made , or ostensibly made , to blend the facts it conserved into a biographical whole .

		That a sat - isfactory life of Jones , which should remove him from cloud-land and show him to posterity as his American and European contemporaries knew him , awaited only the advent of a writer competent to undertake it , is amply proved by Mr.
A. C. Buell	PERSON	's spirited work in two volumes entitled ''
Paul Jones	PERSON	, Founder of the
American Navy	ORGANIZATION	'' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		Mr.
Buell	PERSON	has ransacked the records , private and official , and consulted and collated the authorities , English and foreign .

		The book is really the fruit of pains - taking research and extended effort ; and no student of our maritime history can afford to neglect it .

		It is neatly gotten , up , and contains two portraits -LRB- one in colors -RRB- of
Jones	LOCATION	, and a few other cuts .

		A serviceable reference-book of Russian history .

		r *
Hector H. Munro	PERSON	's account of The Rise of the Russian Empire '' C p age & ^ wou , d be ftn excellent reference-book if it were supplied with a good index .

		The statement of the rise of the Rurikovitch dynasty , from the time of the first Russ-Varongian invaders in 862 to the extinction of the house in the sixteenth century , is given with a true appreciation of important events , and with a clear method .

		The history of this period has evi - dently been studied with thoroughness in such few sources as are available , and other authorities have been freely consulted .

		Thus the book becomes a valuable addition to a working library on history , or , rather , it would be so were it not for the in - completeness of the aforementioned index .

		A masterpiece of historical writing the book is not , either in style , or in characterization of races and epochs .

		The style is not bad , it is merely medi - ocre , reminding one of the dry dust-and-bones writings of pedagogical historians , save only when the author has attempted to enliven his narrative by humorous comment , and then the impression received is decidedly unfavorable , for such witti - cisms only rob the writing of its dignity without improving its general tone in the least .

		That luminous picture of peoples and of epochs , ex - pected in these days from writers of general his - tories , is entirely lacking in Mr.
Munro	PERSON	's book , unless , indeed , an exception be made in favor of the portrayal of Russian political disorder and tur - moil .

		This failure is , however , not the fault of the author , but of his subject ; for surely it would be difficult for the most gifted historian to evolve any exact and clear-cut characterizations from the chaotic jumble of Russian politics , rulers , and races , in their earlier history .

		The author closes his account just when the Russian nation begins to assume a definite entity , and so denies himself the opportunity of showing his ability in dealing with a period where the subject people are better known , and the policy of rulers is more clearly defined .

		As a whole , the `` Rise of the Russian Empire '' is a serviceable book of reference , but it is not a great history .

		_ New series of
Globe School Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	signal - Engiish classics izes its entrance into the educational for school use .

		ggj ^ | jy I 88u i n g t en volumes in a new '' Star Series of English Classics . ''

		They are de - voted to the required texts for college entrance , as follows : Burke on '' Conciliation , '' edited by Miss
Mary A. Jordan	PERSON	;
Coleridge	PERSON	's '' Ancient Mariner , '' edited by Mr.
Carlton E. Noyes	PERSON	;

1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 311 exercises , and suggestions for study .

		The volumes all have illustrations , rather elaborate introductions , and notes , the latter appearing at the end .

		The series seems to us an altogether admirable one , and augurs well for the future activity of the new firm of publishers .

		The law in What is variously known as medical its relation jurisprudence , or forensic medicine , to physician * .

		ig taught J n the law 8C hools of the
United States	LOCATION	by lawyers and in the medical schools by physicians .

		It was suggested , some years ago , that the latter institutions of learning would be bene - fitted in no small degree by hearing lawyers discuss he problems arising on the confines of law and of medicine as well , presenting another point of view , and that the one invariably held when medicine is called in to assist in the determination of litigation , whether civil or criminal .

		As a text-book to this end , in part , is to be considered `` The Law in its Relation to Physicians '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- , by Mr.
Arthur N. Taylor	PERSON	, LL.B. , of the
New York	LOCATION	bar .

		Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	has embodied in a duodecimo of rather more than five hundred pages a mass of adjudi - cated cases which should serve as a complete guide to the medical practitioner , so far as his legal re - sponsibilities for his professional contact with his patients is concerned , with such lessons drawn from them as can be naturally inferred in a science so inexact as the law .

		The work covers all matters on both the civil and criminal sides of medical juris - prudence , and is enlivened by many curious and entertaining incidents .

		Writtenfrom ^ r '
Henry Clews	PERSON	's book entitled the Wail street `` The Wall Street Point of View '' point of view .

		-LRB- Silver ,
Burdett & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the clear - cut and incisive statement of the opinions on cur - rent questions , political , financial , and commercial , of a keen and prosperous man of business who has '' succeeded in life , '' and is therefore pretty generally satisfied with things as he found them .

		In point of ideals , Mr.
Clews	PERSON	does not , as
Emerson	LOCATION	phrased it , exactly `` hitch his wagon to a star '' ; but his book is full of hard sense if not of high thinking .

		Among the topics treated are the Railroad Question , Trusts and Corporations , Panics and their Indications , Speculation and Business , the
Cleveland	LOCATION	Adminis - tration , the Masses and the Classes , the
Nation	ORGANIZATION	's Credit , etc. .

		There is a leaven of illustrative anec - dote throughout , and the style is easy and colloquial .

		The '' business man '' will find Mr.
Clews	PERSON	's book pleasant and satisfying reading , and an arsenal of useful '' points . ''

		Such difficult readers as feel that they would like to know more of `` David Harum '' than can be got from the popular novel of that name , may find their account in the little book called '' The Real
David Harum	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Arthur T. Vance	PERSON	, who tells us all about , or quite as much as the most exacting reader ought to want to Genesis of the hf.ro of a popular novel .

		know about , the original of the homespun hero of Mr.
Westcott	PERSON	's widely-read novel .

		This original , we learn , was one
David Hannum	PERSON	, a quaint village character of northern
New York	LOCATION	, whom a former neighbor describes as '' an ordinary sort of an amus - ing cuss , '' a characterization which Mr.
Vance	PERSON	's pages rather serve to bear out .

		Mr.
Westcott	PERSON	must be credited with having turned a most unpromising subject to good account in his novel .

		The book is copiously illustrated from photographs .

Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Young readers particularly will be delighted with these crisp , vivid , and direct lit - tle narratives , the former of which is of especial value by reason of the formative impression it gives of a high and steadfast , if severely simple , character .

		No story of frontier adventure yields in interest to the true tale of the life of
Sam Houston	LOCATION	; and Mrs.
Elliott	PERSON	tells it well .

		Both authors seem to have made good use of the authorities ; and ample references are supplied for those who care to pursue the subject further in fuller and weightier works .

		Each volume has its portrait .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		The library edition of the writings of
Alphonse Daudet	PERSON	, for some time in course of publication by Messrs.
Little	PERSON	,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	, should now , we imagine , although we have lost the count , be well on the way toward completion .

		The two volumes just added to the set contain the three '' Tarascon '' novels , besides a collection of sketches and short ' stories called '' Studies and Landscapes . ''

		Those volumes have been translated by Miss Wormeley with her customary skill , and no slight addition to their attractiveness is made by the special introductory essays which Professor
W. P. Trent	PERSON	contributes .

		The first two '' Tartarin '' books have a volume together ; the other volume contains '' Port Tarascon '' and the miscellany already noted .

		Among the latest issues in the '' Temple Classics '' -LRB- Dent-Macmillan -RRB- , chief interest attaches to the first volume in what will eventually form a complete English translation of the old thirteenth - century allegory of '' The Romance of the Rose . ''

		The translator who has undertaken this formidable task is Mr.
F. S. Ellis	PERSON	, whose previous work in the same field will be gratefully remembered .

		The inclusion of this important literary undertaking in such a series as the '' Temple Classics '' reflects , no little credit on the enterprise of the publish - ers .

		Other recent volumes in the same series include `` Tully 's Offices , '' in the English of
Roger L'Estrange	PERSON	; ''

		The Storied West Indies , '' by Mr.

Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Sir
W. M. Conway	PERSON	's '' The Alps from End to End , '' and
Major L. A. Waddell	PERSON	's '' Among the Himalayas , '' are two of the most important works of travel published of late years , and both now reappear in new and cheap - ened editions from the press of the
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		They are abundantly and beautifully illustrated .

		Nothing is more gratifying to those actively interested in the teaching of history than the recent multiplication of books and pamphlets containing source-material in easily accessible form .

		The latest publication of this description is the '' Source-Book of English History '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- prepared by Dr.
Guy Carleton Lee	PERSON	.

		It is a thick volume of six hundred pages , containing extracts which cover the whole course of English history , even including the war in
South Africa	LOCATION	.

		Documentary and descriptive or narrative material are provided in about equal parts , and a valuable bibliography greatly en - hances the usefulness of the work .

		The
Jewish Publication Society of America	ORGANIZATION	, encour - aged by the success of the '' American Jewish Year Book , '' published last year , have issued a second vol - ume for the year just ended , and expect to make the publication a regular annual undertaking .

		The work is greatly increased in size and consequently in useful - ness for reference .

		The Valois romances of
Alexandre Dumas	PERSON	have been republished in a three-volume set by
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		They include '' La Reine Margot , '' '' La Dame de Monsoreau , '' and '' Les Quarante-Cinq , '' and have been newly translated with much care .

		A series of full-page original illustrations adds greatly to the attractiveness of this edition .

		Dr.
Lyman C. Newell	PERSON	's '' Experimental Chemistry '' -LRB-
Heath	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is essentially a laboratory manual for students in secondary schools , and shows evidence of great care and thoroughness in its compilation .

		The fact that the entire work has been read for suggestions and correc - tions by nearly a score of the most competent teachers of the subject , should commend the work to favorable consideration .

		The ''
Cambridge	LOCATION	'' single-volume editions of English and American poets , which Mr.
H. E. Scudder	PERSON	has been editing so acceptably , seem to have justified their ex - istence from the publishers ' point of view , since every year brings a new volume to the series .

		Mrs.
Brown	PERSON	- ing is the poet now presented , with the accompaniment of a graceful introductory essay , and a few pages of useful notes .

		Two ''
Temple Primers	ORGANIZATION	, '' in addition to those pre - viously noticed by us , are '' The Human Frame and the Laws of Health , '' by Drs.
Rebinann	PERSON	and Seller ; and '' Judgment in Literature , '' by Mr.
W. Basil Worsfold	PERSON	.

		They are published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, '' edited by Mr.
George W. E. Russell	PERSON	. ''

		Anatomy , Physiology , and Hygiene for High Schools , '' by Dr.
Henry F. Howes	PERSON	, has been published by the
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and '' A General Physiology for High Schools , '' by Messrs.
M. L. Macy	PERSON	and
H. W. Norris	PERSON	, by the same firm .

		There is the usual exagger - ated stress upon alcohol and tobacco , although the treatment of these subjects is not quite so offensive to the scientific mind as is frequently the case in books of this sort .

		Messrs.
Doubleday	PERSON	,
Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the American agents for the new '' Monthly Review , '' edited by Mr.
Henry Newbolt	PERSON	, and published by Mr.
John Murray	PERSON	.

		The first number has just appeared , and its contents , which are at least upon the level of the best of its fellow - monthlies , bespeak the favorable consideration of the most intelligent class of readers .

		An editorial section affords a novelty , and Mr.
Newbolt	PERSON	's poem represents a feature which we trust will be continued .

		In appear - ance , the new review distances all its rivals .

		Its dig - nity and beauty of type , page , and cover , place the periodical in a class of its own , and set a standard which others would do well to imitate .

		Finally , we mention the fact that there are illustrations which really illus - trate .

		Dr.
A. E. DUNNING	PERSON	, in the Congregationalist , says of this book : '' The atmosphere of the mountains , with their rude beauty and gran - deur , the homely humanness of the characters , and the rapid movement of the story in its skilful mingling of comedy and tragedy absorb the reader 's attention from the start , and he surrenders to the claims on his interest and sympathy .

		The revival , the schoolhouse scene , the hut with the still in
Grimgory Gulch	LOCATION	are boldly drawn life pictures .

		Ginsey 's tragic story is a delicate and masterly piece of work .

		The religious ideas distorted by ignorance , the rude notions of justice with - out law , the ancestral feuds , and the struggling aspirations of the mountain boys and girls as they appear in this story are true to life .

		They vividly recall to us scenes which have passed before our eyes .

		We do not recall any novel whose scenes are laid among these remarkable people which more faithfully and attractively represents them than this one .

		It throbs with controlled sympathy .

		Its pathos is relieved by humor and hope .

		It has the well-blended elements of a wholesome and powerful story . ''

		Two streets running at right angles can now be photographed successfully at one exposure and other equally difficult feats are possible .

		For photographing broad landscapes , mountain ranges , marine views , yacht races , field sports of all kinds in fact , any view spreading over a large area the '' Al-Vista '' does what no other camera ever did or can do .

FREDERICK MAX MULLER	PERSON	.

		The death of
Max Miiller	ORGANIZATION	brings up again the old question concerning the importance of the popularizer as an agent for the advance - ment of science , and sets once more in sharp contrast the attitudes respectively assumed toward such a man by the reading public and the body of quiet scientific workers .


Max Miiller	PERSON	, like
Kenan	PERSON	,
Froude	PERSON	,
Huxley	LOCATION	and
Tyn	PERSON	- dall to name only a few of his famous con - temporaries had in preeminent degree the gift of style , the charm of graceful literary art , and the power to interest ordinary minds in subjects not easily forced upon their atten - tion .

		This was at once his bane as a scholar and the secret of his popular success .

		Trans - ferring our attention for a moment from the individual to the group which he so typically illustrated , we must say that the attitude to - ward such men of those critics who stand for the methods of pure science is apt to be very ungracious , being compounded of no small amount of intellectual arrogance , and even of envy , mingled with the more legitimate ele - ments that derive from the sense of superior knowledge and firmer hold upon the facts .

		In the view of the extremer devotees of pure sci - ence , it becomes a misdemeanor to write attrac - tively , and a felony to achieve popularity with the laity .

		Sometimes , as was notably true in the case of
Kenan	PERSON	, the offence is reckoned so great that the offender receives only the most grudging sort of recognition from his fellow - workers in the same field , although in their hearts they are conscious that he stands abreast of the strongest of them , even when judged by the most exacting standards .

		He has ventured to be popular , and the fact that he has re - mained rigorously scientific does not remove the stigma in the eyes of these self-constituted guardians of scholarship .


Max Muller	PERSON	was far from being a philolo - gist and a student of comparative religion in the sense in which
Kenan	PERSON	was both , and his intellectual armor was doubtless vulnerable at many points ; nevertheless , it is unquestionably true that he accomplished much work of solid value , and deserved well of science for his That science , especially as repre - services .

		346 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, sented by the younger school of men trained at the German universities , has done him something less than justice , is a fact that must be admitted by the impartial observer .

		If he failed in accuracy of knowledge , if he could not overcome certain intellectual prejudices , if he did not keep abreast of the scholarship of his time , his was still a larger personality than that of many a critic who assailed him , and who , without one-tenth of his actual ac - complishment , affected to hold his authority beneath serious consideration .


Max Miiller	PERSON	was born in
Dessau	LOCATION	in
1823	DATE	, and was a son of the poet
Wilhelm Miiller	PERSON	.

		The artistic temperament which was thus his birthright came near to making of him a musician instead of a scholar , and resulted in at least one piece of purely literary compo - sition , the `` Deutsche Liebe '' of his youth , an exquisite bit of refined sentimentalism long familiar to English readers in the translation entitled `` Memories . ''

		He studied Sanskrit at
Leipzig	LOCATION	, and translated the `` Hitopadesa '' at the age of twenty-one .

		Continuing his Sans - krit studies under
Bopp	PERSON	and Burnouf , he went to
England	LOCATION	in
1846	DATE	for the purpose of editing the `` Rig - Veda , '' a commission given him by the
East India Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		This great under - taking , which was , however , in large part per - formed by another hand , occupied him largely for nearly thirty years , the last of the six volumes being dated as late as 174 .

		He made his home at
Oxford	LOCATION	, and became succes - sively a member , a fellow , a sub-librarian , and a professor of the
University	ORGANIZATION	.

		In
1875	DATE	, he practically resigned his chair , and gave his chief attention to the work of editing `` The Sacred Books of the East , '' a series that event - ually numbered thirty or forty volumes .

		Among the almost innumerable publications of his busy half-century of writing , mention should be made of his `` Lectures on the Sci - ence of Language , '' his `` Chips from a German Workshop , '' his `` History of Sanskrit Liter - ature , '' his
Hibbert	PERSON	lectures on `` The Origin and Growth of Religions , '' and his '' Science of Thought . ''

		Nor should we fail to include in this list the translation of
Kant	PERSON	's '' Kritik der Reinen Vernunft , '' which he made upon the occasion of the centenary of that great work , and which is so significant of his con - stant adherence to the Kantian system and the Kantian method of envisaging philosoph - ical problems .

		His fifty and more years of Oxford life have been comparatively unevent - ful , save for the delivery of his lectures , the publication of his books , and the honors be - stowed upon him by potentates and by learned societies .

		Strange to say , this life-long stu - dent of Indian thought and language never visited the land which engaged so large a share of his attention .

		He was one of the most famous of Orientalists , but he never set foot in an Oriental country .

		Miiller rode his hobbies very hard , and per - haps the hardest ridden of them all was his way of accounting for mythology as a disease of language .

		Finding the names of the Greek and Hindu deities to be words traceable to the phenomena of nature the sun , the sky , and the clouds he theorized to the effect that all mythology resulted from primitive descriptions of natural objects , the sense in which the words were used gradually becom - ing modified into metaphorical meanings , until the literal signification of the terms had been quite forgotten .

		This seemed to be a key that would fit almost any of the locks of folk - lore and popular theology , and with it he sought to reveal the innermost secrets of the classical and Oriental cosmogonies .

		It was a very popular theory a generation ago , and had things its own way with the general public .

		It was so easy , and at the same time so pleas - ing to the poetic sense , to reduce every primi - tive belief to some variation of the omnipres - ent solar myth that readers were quite capti - vated by the notion .

		But the thing was overdone , and a sense of humor began to exert its corrosive action upon this too pleasing theory , until solar myths lost their favor , and few are now so poor to do them reverence .

		Miiller had many quarrels and controver - sies in his special field of Sanskrit , and in the wider field of comparative philology , but these need not concern us here .

		His one great quarrel with modern scientific thought was based upon his view of the origin of human speech .

		During the sixties and seventies , when Darwinism was having pretty much its own way with most classes of thinkers , from naturalists to philosophers , it encountered what seemed to be a very ugly snag in the oppo - sition of Miiller , based upon strictly philo - logical grounds .

		The theory of evolution seemed to offer no way of accounting for the beginning of intelligible speech , and , although Darwinians were convinced that this difficulty could not be a real one , they were nevertheless put to their wits ' ends to deal with it as it was presented in
Miiller	LOCATION	's cogent argument .

		The process of development , he said , could readily
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 347 enough be traced back to the roots of a lan - guage , but there it seemed to stick .

		The Aryan roots were perfectly definite symbols for definite concepts , and they seemed to have no reasonably imaginable antecedents . ''

		There they are , gentlemen , '' he said in substance , '' and what are you going to do about it ? ''

		The `` bow-wow '' theory , which ascribed to them an onomatopoetic character , was too childish for serious consideration , and the '' pooh-pooh '' theory , which sought to explain them as the primitive symbols of emotional conditions , was quite inadequate to account for them .

		During his later years , Miiller himself seemed to feel that his negative atti - tude toward the most pregnant conception of modern philosophy was hardly becoming a man of science , and he came to realize that the mere lack of a reasonable theory of the origin of language was not enough to make men believe that it had no rational origin .

		His own view became considerably modified by the speculations of Professor Noiie , and he ac - cepted the '' yo-heave-ho '' theory , which ac - counted for the mysterious roots as a product of the clamor concomitant of men engaged in common labor as providing at least a provis - ional method for the solution of the problem .

		As a matter of fact , this problem , as well as the allied problem of accounting for thought without language , no longer seems as formidable as it did a generation ago .

		The doctrine of evolution carries with it the absolute necessity for the evolution of speech by some natural process , and the exact nature of that process is a matter of detail that science may safely be trusted to make clear .

		As for M tiller 's con - tention that thought is impossible without lan - guage , it may be said that
Whitney	PERSON	's acute polemic assailed it with considerable success a generation ago , and that the natural psychology of the past score of years , as contrasted with the artificial psychology of an earlier period , has made it evident that thought and language are parallel developments , to neither of which can any absolute priority be assigned .

		Perhaps the clearest exposition of this scientific view is that made by Romanes about fifteen years ago .

		In this , as in many other matters ,
Muller	PERSON	's intellect never quite escaped from the meta - physical stage of development , a fact which is best illustrated by his thoroughgoing accept - ance of the Kantian philosophy as the final expression of metaphysical thought .

		`` That last infirmity of the philosophic mind , '' as the * ' Kantian superstition '' is styled by a recent writer for these pages , stiffened to the end the intellectual processes of the brilliant scholar whose death we now deplore , and impeded their free and natural operation .

		There is no re - proach in this , but there is some occasion for regret that a thinker of
Muller	ORGANIZATION	's capacity should have been kept many years behind his age by the trammels of a system that had long since accomplished its work .

		SHAKESPEARE OR BALZAC : WHICH IS GREATER ?

		The most notable apparition in the world of let - ters since
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	is
Balzac	LOCATION	.

		In the
last half-century	DATE	Balzac has gained immensely in the esteem of both the people and the critics , until of late it is being proclaimed , `` A greater than Shakespeare is here . ''

		If we would compare the greatest of dramatists with the greatest of novelists , we might well set over against each other such masterpieces as '' King Lear '' and '' Old Goriot . ''

		Which of these tragedies of base filial ingratitude affects us the more power - fully ?

		Neither Lear nor Goriot are heroic figures .

		Lear is full of a teasing petulance , is full of com - plaints and curses against his ungrateful daughters , and insists so selfishly and importunately upon his paternal rights to verbal and actual gratitude that our sympathy is chilled .

		He frets and fumes too much to be a convincing hero .

		As against this , the uncomplaining devotion and ceaseless sacrifice of Goriot are perfect .

		Lear bestows merely his kingdom , and clamors for gratitude ; Goriot be - stows everything , to life itself ; and utters no bitter , reproaching word .

		Yet Goriot is so petty and weak and narrow and sordid that the heroic vanishes , and we see merely a display of stupid instinct .

		Neither Lear nor Goriot evince real magnanimity ; both are ignoble .

		And
Lear	PERSON	, as an unreasonable , querulous dotard , leads us to somewhat excuse his daughters .

		Indeed ,
Lear	PERSON	himself in his sanest mo - ment practically acknowledges that their conduct is not groundless , when he says that he is '' more sinned against than sinning . ''

		His daughters show consideration , and even more , when
Regan	PERSON	says : '' For his particular , I 'll receive him gladly , But not one follower . ''

		The sentiment is echoed by
Goneril	LOCATION	.

		But
Goriot	PERSON	, ever patient and humble , gives not the slightest pretext for the immeasurable heartlessness of his frivolous daughters .

		If , then , the object of tragedy is to awaken pity in the beholder ,
Goriot	PERSON	is the more convincing figure of the two , is much the finer and completer creation .

		We might go on to point out that
Eugenie Gran	PERSON	- det is in some ways superior to
Juliet	LOCATION	, and
Nanon	ORGANIZATION	to
Juliet	PERSON	's nurse , and certainly Grandet is superior to Shylock .

		As an analyst of the bourgeoisie ,
Balzac	LOCATION	is incomparable ; he knows them to the finger-tips , 348 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, for he is one of them .

		In depicting the passion for pelf , he far outdistances Shakespeare and all com - petitors .

		Farther , a quality which adds much to our enjoyment of
Balzac	LOCATION	's works is the sympathy for his creations which we imbibe from
Balzac	LOCATION	him - self .

		That is , in
Balzac	LOCATION	we find a fascinating lyric tone quite lacking to the serene and cold dramatic objectivity of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		With what a rare gusto Balzac enters into the life of his Comedie Hu - maine !

		With what a vital intensity he feels for the living and breathing people of his real world !

		He enlists our sympathy not only by the general tone of his narrative , but by definite appeals ; as when he says of Nanon , '' At twenty-two years of age the poor girl had been unable to find a situa - tion , so repulsive was her face to almost everyone . ''

		But Shakespeare never makes such an impression upon our feelings ; we can not conceive that he laughed or wept with his creations .

		Another advantage that
Balzac	LOCATION	has over Shake - speare is that he belongs not to the age of spectators , but of readers .

		The demands of stagecraft and of a vulgar audience so hamper Shakespeare in the full and free development of characterization that we think it a thousand pities that he had not en - joyed the scope and freedom of the novel .

		As appealing to the spectator and the hearer , rather than to the reader ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	uses broad and striking effects , almost neglecting the half-tones .

		Since the novelist 's art is greater and more signifi - cant than the dramatist 's , we can never cease regretting that
Shakespeare	PERSON	was not a novelist from whom also we could have had a
Comedie Humaine	ORGANIZATION	, which might be dramatized with sur - passing force .

		For the future , certainly , the drama tends to base itself in the higher art of the novel .

		But if we regret that Shakepeare was a play - writer , we regret still more that he followed the fashion of his time and gave his characters the mediaeval setting of courts and kings .

		Old Goriot is vastly nearer to us than
King Lear	PERSON	; that
Lear	PERSON	can not have a retainer more or less , is a motif of as little interest to us as the lack of proper funeral rites is in the Greek drama .

		The triumph of Shake - speare is that , despite the setting of lords and un - derlings , the vitality of a common humanity still touches the modern mind .

		But Balzac is absolutely modern and democratic ; we breathe not the at - mosphere of courts but of shops ; we see and recog - nize a life which pulsates in myriad forms around us .

		But it may be said , and rightly , that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, although a playwright depicting an outgrown type of society , is infinitely above
Balzac	LOCATION	in universality and grasp .

		The characters of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	have a wholeness of creation , are many-sided , many - motived real men and women ; while
Balzac	LOCATION	's char - acters are too often puppets pulled by a single string .

		Shakespeare gives us the condensed perfect essence of reality the ideal of realism and the realism of the ideal .

		Moreover ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	achieves reality in a single stroke ; the Nurse in
Romeo	LOCATION	and
Juliet	PERSON	is as real in one page as Nanon in fifty though we must grant that Balzac does not offend us with the Zolaistic coarseness of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		Balzac gives us Leonardesque portraits , drawn , framed , and embellished with infinite and loving care ; while
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	presents rough Rembrantesque etchings which tell the whole story in a few powerful lines .

		And we need not enlarge upon the obvious fact that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	has in the highest degree those very important elements in which
Balzac	ORGANIZATION	is entirely lacking , namely , humor and poetry .

		In short ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is the greater genius ; yet just because he is playwright and his mise en sc & ne archaic , we read him out of a sense of duty , but Bdlzac out of delight .


HIRAM M. STANLEY	PERSON	.

		C OMM UNICA TION .

		MR. WARNER AS AN EDITOR .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THB DIAL . -RRB-

		In your appreciative farewell to
Charles Dudley Warner	PERSON	, in your last issue , occur these words : `` He was the nominal editor of the Library of the World 's Best Literature ' '' ; and the rest of the sentence empha - sizes , in an especially misleading fashion , the impres - sion that the real burden of that work fell upon other shoulders .

		Many circumstances combine to urge prompt and earnest protest against this erroneous statement .

		One of the chief temptations at present besetting our suc - cessful literary workers is the opportunity to sell their names , as a means of advertising work which is not in the full sense their own .

		That some well-known men have actually yielded to such golden baits , seems certain .

		Against all such commercialism , degrading to the artist and to our national life generally , Mr.
Warner	PERSON	has pro- tested often in ringing words .

		His recent series of romances was perhaps marred , as a work of art , by too strenuous insistance upon just such notes of warning .

		The cynics will rejoice to accept any intimation that he himself drifted with the current .

		A leading editorial writer of
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	contributed more signed articles to Mr.
Warner	PERSON	's '' Library '' than any other contributor .

		That writer 's well-earned repute for fairness , accuracy , and caution , added as it inevita - bly will be , in this case , to the great force of THE DIAL itself , will render this statement hard indeed to contro - vert .

		Yet it would probably have been felt by Mr.
Warner	PERSON	as the most injurious and misleading assertion that could have been made concerning him .

		Certainly the present writer is unable to characterize it in softer terms .

		The circumstances , then , justify frankness .

		The classical field was doubtless the one large historic demesne of literature in which Mr.
Warner	PERSON	felt least willing to trust his own knowledge and judgment .

		In this department , and no other , he states in his final note that one of his assistants '' had charge . ''

		The present letter is based on fullest knowledge of that department during the issue of twenty-two out of the thirty vol - umes .

		Mr.
Warner	PERSON	in every case decided whether an author should appear at all , and how much space should be allotted him .

		His test was , invariably , Can one or more quoted passages be presented , of interest and value to readers at the present day ?

		If not , no mere name could assure admission .

		No assignment of the biographical essay was authorized , without careful in -
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 349 quiry as to the literary capacity and taste of the pro- posed writer .

		Not one such essay , even from
Miss Preston	LOCATION	or Professor
Shorey	PERSON	, was sent to the printer until Mr.
Warner	PERSON	had given it at least one careful uninterrupted critical perusal .

		The galley and page proofs also received his unremitting scrutiny .

		Essays by eminent scholars , though paid for in full , were cast aside because they did not satisfy Mr.
Warner	PERSON	's demand for intrinsic interest and literary form .

		So able an essayist as the late
Thomas Davidson	PERSON	recast every page of his paper on
Sappho	ORGANIZATION	, under strictures from the editor-in-chief .

		I am assured by those who know best , that every page in the thirty volumes of the '' Library '' received the same conscientious attention .

		We may well believe that a work so extensive was never prepared , in so brief a time , more fully under one alert eye , and informed by the spirit of one man .

		It is true that every worker felt encouraged to use all his capacities with the largest freedom ; but that freedom was precisely one of the qualities brought to the task by Mr.
Warner	PERSON	's genial open-minded catholic nature .

		He never tolerated the mere scissors-and-paste work so dismally familiar in too many big books .

		The group of younger writers gathered about him in those days can never cease to be grateful for his inspiration , his searching and stimulat - ing criticism , his unflagging sympathy .

		If any other shoulders lightened the editorial load , it was Mrs.
Runkle	PERSON	's .

		The volume of brief lyrics , in particular , was actually edited by her .

		But she often declared , as did Mr.
Warner	PERSON	himself , that she was first called in precisely because , through many years of professional comradeship , she had come to know Mr.
Warner	PERSON	's literary ideals and methods as well as he did himself .

		As to the rest of us , let me still take space for one typical illustration , at my own expense .

		Mr.
Warner	PERSON	had read in early life , and recalled with delight , the lives of the philosophers by ''
Diogenes Laertius	PERSON	. ''

		He insisted that the sketch of
Socrates	LOCATION	, in particular , must go in .

		After a week or two spent in repairing his own blank ignorance , the classical editor reported with em - phasis , '' It is a medley of misstatements in the original , and made doubly idiotic by the atrocious
Bohn	PERSON	perver - sion . '' ''

		Very well , then , make your own translation . '' ''

		But
Diogenes	PERSON	himself is a bewildered plagiarist , an egregious ass . '' ''

		Very likely ; say so as bluntly as you please , in a half-page biography .

		But I enjoyed him , and I want him in .

		A lot of him , too ! ''

		And eventu - ally
Diogenes	PERSON	got his fourteen pages , over which the great editor renewed his youthful glee .

		Lysias , exempli gratia , and his precious old olive-stump , are alike un - mentioned , for converse reasons .

		The '' Library , '' like every large book , has flaws and uneven places ; but the face of Mr.
Warner	PERSON	shines out from every page .

		I am sure all who know the truth will be eager to state it more strongly than has been possible in this letter .

		Certainly no one , here unnamed , has a right to share , in any appreciable degree , the real editorial responsibility for the '' Library . ''

		Its form and its spirit express , more than all else , the unwearying energy , devotion , wisdom , and taste of
Charles Dudley Warner	ORGANIZATION	.

		L.
Brooklyn	LOCATION	,
N. Y.	PERSON	,
Nov. 3 , 1900	DATE	.

		-LSB- We cheerfully acknowledge that our correspond - ent had better opportunities than our own to know just how the great '' Library '' was edited , and if what we wrote upon the subject has been taken to reflect in any way upon the literary integrity of the late Mr.
Warner	PERSON	, we can only say that nothing could have been farther from our thought .

		As far as our experience went during the publication of the work , it seemed to show that a very large share of the correspondence and other editorial functions was assumed by Mr.
George H. Warner	PERSON	, although of course under the general direction of his bro - ther .

		As a mere matter of the days and hours given to the work , we supposed it fair to say that the larger credit should be given to Mr.
George Warner	PERSON	; but we had no intention of implying that the editor-in-chief did not hold the reins in his bands all the time , or that he was the mere figure - head that our use of the word '' nominal '' might , as we now see , be taken to indicate .

		On the whole , the protest of our correspondent takes the form of a statement so interesting that we are not sorry to have been its innocent provoking cause .

		THE GKEAT APOSTLE OF EVOLUTION .

		* As Professor Huxley , on his memorable visit to
America	LOCATION	in
1876	DATE	, entered
New York	LOCATION	harbor on the steamer `` Germanic , '' he was greatly interested in the tug-boats which tore fiercely up and down and across the bay .

		He looked long at them , and finally turned to Mr.
Smalley	PERSON	and said : '' If I were not a man I think I should like to be a tug . ''

		This casual remark not only exhibited his delight in the restless energy which he saw displayed , but in a very true sense also reflects the spirit and the life - work of the man who uttered it .

		Evolutionist , agnostic , biologist , controversialist , reformer , essayist , philosopher , investigator , and teacher , he was always and everywhere the practical man in affairs but not of them , carrying an Atlas load of the world 's work , and tirelessly seeking to move , to guide , and to control the thought of his age in the shifting tide of public opinion .

		The restless activity of this versatile leader is evident on every page of the '' Life and Letters '' edited by his son , Mr.
Leonard Huxley	PERSON	.

		It is quite impossible to summarize these letters to the brilliant galaxy of correspondents , men eminent in science , in philosophy , in poli - tics , in education , and in literature .

		350 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	,
Clifford	PERSON	,
Clodd	PERSON	, and others who shared in the battle for Evolution .

		To these must be added the names of many prominent biologists in
England	LOCATION	and on the Continent , and a few from
America	LOCATION	.

		In literary circles , Huxley corres - ponded with
Charles Kmgsley	PERSON	,
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	,
Jowett	PERSON	,
Lecky	LOCATION	,
John Morley	PERSON	, and
Tennyson	LOCATION	.

		The wealth of scientific , philosophic , and literary lore in these two volumes of letters may be inferred from this choice list of corres - pondents , but this gives no hint of the inimit - able style in which Huxley wrote what for us is a running comment on the topics of his times .

		And they were momentous times .

		The corres - pondence covers the period from
1850 to 1895	DATE	, years which saw the promulgation and elabora - tion of the Theory of Organic Evolution and the accumulation of evidence in its support ; the extension of this idea into the fields of philoso - phy and religion , though not without a long , vigorous , and often bitter conflict with the established forms of thought ; the multiplica - tion of educational agencies , and the enlarge - ment of educational ideals by the development of scientific and technical instruction at the great centres of culture ; and lastly , though not yet fully accomplished , the revision of theo - logical dogma .

		In all of these changes , Huxley played no small part .

		His services to Evolution are evidenced by his published works , more than a third of the eighty - seven essays listed in the appendix being devoted to this theme .

		He was also the platform expo - nent of the Evolutionary propaganda , and well deserves the title of the '' Great Apostle of Evolution , '' though he himself thus modestly estimates his services in a letter to the Bishop of
Ripon	LOCATION	: 11 As for me , in part from force of circumstance and in part from a conviction I could be of most use in that way , I have played the part of something between maid-of-all-work and gladiator-general for Science , and deserve no such prominence as your kindness has assigned to me . ''

		His matchless skill in controversy undoubt - edly won for Huxley his widest renown .

		His famous bon mot at the
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	meeting of the
British Association	ORGANIZATION	in
1860	DATE	, where he helped to extort a fair hearing for
Darwin	ORGANIZATION	's ideas , will long be remembered .

		In the course of the discussion ,
Bishop Wilberforce	ORGANIZATION	rallied Huxley on his descent from a monkey .

		The tactical advantage which this descent to per - sonalities gave was instantly grasped by
Hux	PERSON	- ley , who , turning to his neighbor , said , '' The Lord hath delivered him into my hands ! '

		The exact words used in this impromptu reply have been variously reported .

		We learn that the most accurate account is that of Mr.
J. R. Green	PERSON	, as follows : '' I asserted and I repeat that a man has no reason to be ashamed of having an ape for his grand - father .

		If there were an ancestor whom I should feel shame in recalling it would rather be a man a man of restless and versatile intellect who , not content with an equivocal f success in his own sphere of activ - ity , plunges into scientific questions with which be has no real acquaintance , only to obscure them by an aimless rhetoric , and distract the attention of his bearers from the real point at issue by eloquent digressions and skilled appeals to religious prejudice . ''

		No doubt Huxley enjoyed a good fight .

		In
1859	DATE	he wrote
Darwin	PERSON	, '' I am sharpening up my claws and beak in readiness . ''

		Again , writing to
Haeckel	PERSON	a propos of his ''
Morphol	PERSON	- ogie , '' he says : `` With respect to the polemic excursus , of course , I chuckle over them most sympathetically , and then say how naughty they are !

		I have done too much of the same sort of thing not to sympathize entirely with you j and I am much inclined to think that it is a good thing for a man , once at any rate in his life , to perform a public war-dance against all sorts of humbug and im - posture . ''

		To
John Morley	PERSON	concerning one of his critics : '' Controversy is as abhorrent to me as gin to a reclaimed drunkard ; but oh dear !

		it would be so nice to squelch that pompous impostor . ''

		His persistency in following up his attacks appears in a letter to his son in regard to hi & opposition to '' General '' Booth 's financial project for the relief of
London	LOCATION	's poor : '' Attacking the
Salvation Army	ORGANIZATION	may look like the advance of a forlorn hope , but this old dog has never yet let go after fixing his teeth into anything or any - body , and he is not going to begin now .

		And it is only a question of holding on . ''

		The following lines from his private journal , written at the birth of his eldest son in
1856	DATE	, reveal the sincerity of Huxley 's motives , his love of truth as he saw it , and hatred of a lie r '' To smite all humbugs , however big ; to give a nobler tone to science ; to set an example of abstinence from petty personal controversies , and of toleration , for everything bullying ; to be indifferent as to whether the work is recognized as mine or not , so long as it i & done : are these my aims ?

		1860 will show . ''

		The same spirit breathes in a courteous letter to Rev.
E. McLure	PERSON	, written in
1891	DATE	: '' So far as I know myself , after making due deduc - tion for the ambition of youth and a fiery temper , which ought to -LRB- but unfortunately does not -RRB- get cooler with age , my sole motive is to get at the truth in all things .

		I do not care one straw about fame , present or posthumous , and I loathe notoriety , but I do care ta have that desire manifest and recognized . ''

		Huxley 's scientific achievements were soon tHuxley had no recollection of using the word '' equivocal . ''

		1900 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 351 recognized by memberships in learned societies conferred upon him at home and abroad .

		At the time of his death he was connected with more than seventy-five such organizations .

		His leadership was also acknowledged in
England	LOCATION	by election to positions of responsibility in various scientific bodies , the most notable be - ing the Presidency of the
Royal Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		The government also availed itself of his services on a number of important commissions which dealt with the Fisheries , Vivisection , Con - tagious Diseases , Medical Acts , Educational Institutions for
Ireland	LOCATION	, the Universities of
Scotland	LOCATION	, Scientific Instruction , and the Ad - vancement of Science .

		His services to education cover the whole field from the kindergarten to the most ad - vanced university instruction .

		For many years he acted as Examiner for the Science and Art department , while his service on the
London	LOCATION
School Board	ORGANIZATION	, though brief , was of far-reaching importance .

		As chairman of the committee which revised the school curriculum , he exerted his influence strongly in favor of practical in - struction in the sciences , technical instruction in household arts for girls , the introduction of systematic instruction in drawing , while above all he insisted upon the importance of the adequate teaching of morals .

		It was at this time that he surprised his Liberal friends by his outspoken advocacy of Bible instruction in the public schools : '' As English literature , as world-old history , as moral teaching , as the
Magna Charta	ORGANIZATION	of the poor and of the oppressed , the most democratic book in the world , he could not spare it . '

		I do not say , ' he adds , ' that even the highest biblical ideal is exclusive of others or needs no supplement .

		But I do believe that the human race is not yet , possibly may never be , in a position to dis - pense with it . ''

		His own letters abound in Biblical allusions re - vealing his remarkable familiarity with Sacred Writ .

		Huxley 's ideals of university education are well known .

		Two American incidents illustrate his feeling with regard to the use of educational endowments .

		He declined to be shown about the buildings at
Yale	ORGANIZATION	, saying to Professor Marsh : '' Show me what you have got inside of them ; I can see plenty of bricks and mortar in my own country . ''

		Commenting upon the liberal provision for research at
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	, he remarked : '' It has been my fate to see great educational funds fossilize into mere bricks and mortar in the petrifying springs of architecture , with nothing left to work them .

		A great warrior is said to have made a desert and called it peace .

		Trustees have sometimes made a pal - ace and called it a university . ''

		In the preface to the American edition of these letters , Mr.
Leonard Huxley	PERSON	calls atten - tion to the cordial reception accorded to his father 's writings and lectures in this country , and his reciprocal feeling toward us . ''

		His own interest in the present problems of the country and the possibilities of its future was always keen , not merely as touching the development of a vast political force one of the dominant factors of the near future but far more as touching the char - acter of its approaching greatness .

		Huge territories and vast resources were of small interest to him in comparison with the use to which they should be put .

		None felt more vividly than he that the true greatness of a nation would depend upon the spirit of the princi - ples it adopted , upon the character of the individuals who make up the nation and shape the channels in which the currents of its being will hereafter flow ... This was the note he struck in the appeal for intellect - ual sincerity and clearness which he made at the end of bis
New York	LOCATION	Lectures on Evolution . '

		... The interest with which he followed the later development of social problems need not be dwelt on here , except to say that he watched their earlier maturity in
America	LOCATION	as an indication of the problems which would after - wards call for a solution in his own country . ''

		His feeling about our Civil War was like that of many Englishmen ; his sympathies were with the South , though he recognized the cause and approved the outcome of the con - flict .

		Writing to his sister , at
Nashville	LOCATION	, in
1864	DATE	, he says : '' I am in the condition of most thoughtful English - men .

		My heart goes with the South , and my head with the North .

		I have no love for the
Yankees	ORGANIZATION	, and I delight in the energy and self-sacrifice of your people ; but for all that , I can not doubt that whether you beat the Yankees or not , you are struggling to uphold a system which must , sooner or later , break down .

		I have not the smallest sentimental sympathy with the negro ; do n't believe in him at all , in short .

		But it is clear to me that slavery means , for the white man , bad political economy ; bad social morality ; bad internal political organization , and a bad influence upon free labour and freedom all over the world .

		For the sake of the white man , therefore , for your children and grandchildren , directly , and for mine , indirectly , I wish to see this system ended .

		Would that the South had had the wisdom to initiate that end without this miserable war ! ''

		The letters of Huxley are intensely human , revealing the passionate sincerity of the man and his interest not merely in the
Book of Nature	ORGANIZATION	, in pure knowledge , and in the problems of existence , but also in the practical affairs of human life .

		His missives to his friends are not studied literary efforts , as were his essays , which he confesses he re-wrote five or six times .

		They are full of the dash and spirit of the im - promptu , while with magnificent abandon he 352 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, revels in allusion , jest , and pun , in his own and foreign tongues ancient and modern .

		Many a keen thrust does he give his adversaries and his friends too .

		The charming bonhomie which pervades his letters is unsurpassed in any cor - respondence which has come to light in recent years .

		Listen to his invitation to his good friend , Dr.
Anton Dohrn	PERSON	, of the
Naples	LOCATION	Marine Station : `` I await the ` Prophecies of the Holy Antonius ' anxiously .

		Like the Jews of old , I come of an unbe - lieving generation , and need a sign .

		The bread and the oil , also the chamber in the wall , shall not fail the prophet when he comes in
August	DATE	: nor
Donner	PERSON	und
Blitzen	LOCATION	either ... And , oh my
Diogenes	LOCATION	, happy in a tub of arthropodous Entwickelungsgeschichte , despise not beefsteaks , nor wives either .

		They also are good . ''

		And this word of encouragement to a fellow - Philistine : '' MY DEAR JOHNNY You are certainly improving .

		As a practitioner in the use of cold steel myself , I have read your letter in to-day 's Nature , mit Ehrfurcht und Bewunderung . '

		... God be with thee , my son , and strengthen the contents of thy gall-bladder !

		Ever thine ,
T. H. HUXLEY	PERSON	. ''

		By far the most notable and interesting of his correspondence is that with his honored friend
Charles Kingsley	PERSON	.

		Replying to a letter of sympathy at the death of his eldest son , Huxley reveals the very depths of his religious convictions : '' My convictions , positive and negative , on all the matters of which you speak , are of long and slow growth , and are firmly rooted .

		But the great blow which fell upon me seemed to stir them to their foun - dation , and had I lived a couple of centuries earlier I could have fancied a devil scoffing at me and them and asking me what profit it was to have stripped myself of the hopes and consolations of the mass of mankind ?

		To which my only reply was and is Oh devil !

		truth is better than much profit .

		I have searched over the grounds of my belief , and if wife and child and name and fame were all to be lost to me one after the other as the penalty , still I will not lie ... Kicked into the world a boy without guide or training , or with worse than none , I confess to my shame that few men have drunk deeper of all kinds of sin than I. Happily , my course was arrested in time before I had earned absolute destruction and for long years I have been slowly and painfully climbing , with many a fall , towards better things .

		And when I look back , what do I find to have been the agents of my redemp - tion ?

		The hope of immortality or of future reward ?

		I can honestly say that for these fourteen years such a consideration has not entered my head .

		No , I can tell you exactly what has been at work .

		Sartor Resartus led me to know that a deep sense of religion was com - patible with the entire absence of theology .

		Secondly , science and her methods gave me a resting-place in - dependent of authority and tradition .

		Thirdly , love opened up to me a view of the sanctity of human na - ture , and impressed me with a deep sense of responsi - bility .

		... If in the supreme moment when I looked down into my boy 's grave my sorrow was full of sub - mission and without bitterness , it is because these agencies have worked upon me , and not because I have ever cared whether my poor personality shall remain distinct for ever from the All from whence it came and whither it goes . ''

		And thus , my dear
Kingsley	PERSON	, you will understand what my position is .

		I may be quite wrong , and in that case I know I shall have to pay the penalty for being wrong .

		But I can only say with Luther , '
Gott	PERSON	helfe mir , Ich kann nichts anders . ' ''

		The editor 's work has been done excellently , and Huxley 's '' Life and Letters '' is destined to take high rank among epistolary autobiog - raphies .


CHARLES A. KOFOID	PERSON	.

		THE KULERS OF SOUTHERN
ITALY	LOCATION	.

		* It is two years since Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	pub - lished that great vision of Eome called ''
Ave Roma Immortalis	PERSON	, '' which fairly established his reputation as a romantic historian .

		In the work entitled '' The Rulers of the South '' his observation takes a more extensive view ; and the plan is chronological rather than topo - graphical .

		Briefly , it is a rapid survey of the tides of conquest which swept over
Magna Gra3cia	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- as the Romans called the
Southern	ORGANIZATION	provinces of the Italian mainland -RRB- and
Sicily	LOCATION	;
Malta	LOCATION	is merely glanced at , and hardly de - serves a place in the title .

		Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	's termini are the earliest legends on the one hand , and on the other the contest between
Francis I.	PERSON	and
Charles V.	PERSON	for the possession of
Sicily	LOCATION	.

		This range of over two thousand years is traversed with alert step and unflag - ging enthusiasm .

		The author 's qualifications for his great task are peculiar , and almost too well-known to need recapitulation .

		No living foreigner knows
Italy	LOCATION	dialects , prejudices , village-life , superstitions , and all so inti - mately as Mr.
Marion Crawford	PERSON	; and cer - tainly no living man of letters could have handled his materials with greater skill or distilled them with more certainty into a fluent and fascinating narrative .

		In the first volume , after a graceful group - ing of the myths in whose half-light all the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	lands are steeped , Mr.
Craw	PERSON	- ford rapidly summarizes the history of
Sicily	LOCATION	and
Southern Italy	LOCATION	through their successive possession by Sicelians ,
Phrenicians	LOCATION	, Greeks ; * THE RULERS OF THE SOUTH :
SICILY	LOCATION	,
CALABRIA	LOCATION	, AND
MALTA	LOCATION	.

		THE DIAL 353 Romans , Byzantines , Goths , and Arabs ; Nor - mans , German Emperors and French ; Span - iards of
Aragon	LOCATION	and of
Bourbon	LOCATION	, and
Savoy	ORGANIZATION	- ard Kings of
Italy	LOCATION	.

		He sharply fixes our attention on one great difference between the Italian South and all other countries bordering on the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	. ''

		It has lacked strength of its own from the begin - ning , it has lacked the genius without which strength breeds monsters ; it has been wanting in the original character which bears modification but resists extirpa - tion ; it has produced no race which another has not been able to enslave ; one people after another has taken possession of it , each amalgamating in some degree with the last , but the welding of races has not become a great race , nor has any first element out - lasted and outruled the others .

		It has been the prize of contending warriors , it has been the playground of magnificent civilizations , but it has neither acted the part of conqueror itself , nor has it ever produced a civilization of its own .

		... In the balance of the world 's forces
Sicily	LOCATION	has been feminine and reproduc - tive rather than masculine and creative ; endowed with supreme natural beauty , she has been loved by all , she has favored many , and she has borne sons to a few , sons such as Archimedes and Theocritus , Dionysius and Agathocles ,
King Roger	PERSON	and
Frederick Second of Hohenstaufen	ORGANIZATION	, of Greek ,
Norman	PERSON	, and Norman-German blood .

		But if we ask for a great man whom we may call a Sicilian , we must ask what Sicilians were , and we shall receive different answers in different ages , ` Greeks , Arabs ,
Normans	ORGANIZATION	, Spaniards and Italians have all been Sicilians at one time or another . ''

		Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	's account of the Greek periods of domination in
Sicily	LOCATION	is both connected and luminous ; and the space he devotes to it is quite in proportion to its supreme importance in the history of the island .

		In general , he follows and agrees with
Adolf Holm	PERSON	-LRB- whose ` Geschichte Siciliens still remains untrans - lated -RRB- ; but his judgment , especially in ques - tions of geography and topography , is evi - dently based on his own knowledge , which is both comprehensive and accurate .

		The narra - tive is interspersed with passages of episodical brilliancy , as , for example , the description of the disastrous Athenian expedition a theme which never fails to stir profoundly all tellers of the tragic tale , from Thucydides down .

		The portraits of the Graeco-Sicilian worthies , too , are vivid and convincing : all readers will carry away from these pages a fresh and last - ing impression of
Gelon	LOCATION	,
Hiero	PERSON	, the
Dionysii	LOCATION	,
Dion	PERSON	,
Hermocrates	LOCATION	, and
Timoleon	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Greek character , both individual and as a race , has often been judged as Mr.
Craw	PERSON	- ford judges it ; but the verdict has seldom been so eloquently pronounced as in his words : '' He -LSB- the Greek -RSB- was as incapable of sinking his highly original personality in the ranks of an organiza - tion as he was of devoting his whole energies to money - making ; he was a free lance rather than a trained sol - dier ; an artist , not a middle-class citizen ; a man of genius , not a banker .

		In the heat of enthusiasm there were few feats which he could not accomplish , and his restless blood could not brook the daily round of a humdrum existence .

		In war he loved the brilliant pageant , the high pjcan song , the splendid arms , the woven garlands , the air of triumph before the battle , and the trophy and the sacrifice after the fight .

		When peace followed war , he craved the excitement of the great Greek games , the emotions of the almost impos - sibly beautiful in art , the heart-beating of the reckless player throwing for high stakes , the physical intoxica - tion of wine , and the intellectual intoxication of the theatre ; and when these palled , he lost patience with peace and became the most gratuitously quarrelsome of human beings , taking offense at the hue of his neighbor 's cloak , attacking a friend for an imaginary attack upon the least of his innumerable vanities , and making war about nothing , with the fine conviction of a thoroughly ill-tempered child , that smashes its new doll to atoms rather than be good for five minutes . ''

		As the Greek was individually , so were the Greeks in a body , wherever they established themselves , iu the fertile plains and undulating hills of
Asia Minor	LOCATION	, in the wild mountains and isolated valleys of their own
Greece	LOCATION	, and that greater Hellas with which this story has been concerned .

		They were always at odds with each other , and they rarely fought a foreign foe with - out seeing the faces of their born countrymen in tbe ranks that opposed them ; they were alike incapable of submitting without a murmur to the rule of a single master , and of governing themselves as one whole by the orderly judgment of the many .

		Wherever they appeared they excited admiration and they often in - spired terror ; wherever they dwelt , even for a brief term of years , they left behind them works of lasting beauty ; but whereas , as artists , as poets , and as philos - ophers , they created a standard that has made rivalry impossible and imitation ridiculous , their government has left no trace in the lands they once inhabited , and their laws have had less influence upon the subsequent law-givers of mankind than those of the Chinese or the Aztecs .

		In their arts and in their literature they worked for all time ; in their government they were opportunists and intriguers , when they were not vision - aries , and the type of their race having disappeared from the world , the conditions under which it lived are beyond the comprehension of other civilized peoples . ''

		After the Greek came the Roman ; and into something over a hundred pages is condensed the stirring story of Roman domination , from the
First Punic	ORGANIZATION	war to the downfall of the
Western Empire	ORGANIZATION	, 476
A.D.	LOCATION	; seven hundred years of rule and misrule , in which the gigan - tic robberies of Verres make other oppressions seem but petty annoyances .

		With the brief ineffectual episode of Goths and Vandals , the first volume closes .

		Volume II .

		opens with the Byzantine period , followed in rapid succession by the Saracen invasions and the rise of Palermo as a Mo - hammedan capital , the appearance and domi - 354 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, nation of the Normans , the fierce struggle with the Angevins , the bloody Sicilian Ves - pers , and the varying successes of French King and
Holy Roman Emperor	ORGANIZATION	.

		All these contests , whatever their other issue , had one unvarying result : they drenched the devoted island with blood '' quicquid delirant reges , plectuntur Achivi . ''

		The immense recuper - ative power of the land is thus depicted by the author : '' Those who know
Sicily	LOCATION	even superficially must easily realize that its conditions of prosperity could change with surprising quickness in the alternations of peace and war .

		It was an altogether agricultural coun - try , but it was , and still is , the richest in the
Mediterra	LOCATION	- nean .

		I will compare it , in its different states , to a great foundry or manufactory .

		Everything required for the production of valuable merchandise is present , waiting to be smelted , cast , turned , and finished .

		Fur - naces glow , hammers ring , lathes move silently and quickly , a thousand artisans are at work , and wealth is created hourly and instantly by sure and industrious hands .

		Presently comes the check ; there is war , and the enemy is at hand , or the men strike and go away in a body .

		The place is the same , and yet it is all at once a dreary wilderness , the fires are gone out , the wind howls through the vast deserted sheds , the ma - chinery rusts in the silence , and it all looks as if only a miracle could bring back the extinguished life .

		Yet all things are ready for the making of wealth , as they were before .

		The enemy retires , or the strike is over , and in a day the factory is once again in the / roar and blast of production , alive and awake . ''

		Thus also
Sicily	LOCATION	lay waste from time to time , and awoke again to instant riches at the golden touch of peace .

		There is not a valley in the whole island where men have not lain in ambush to kill other men , nor a field that has not been dyed crimson , nor a lovely defile of the mountains whose rivulet has not run red .

		Within the narrow seagirt space , six hundred miles round , Greeks and Phoenicians , Carthaginians and Romans , Byzantines , Goths ,
Saracens	LOCATION	,
Normans	ORGANIZATION	, Frenchmen , Catalans , freemen and slaves fought almost unceasingly for more than two thousand years ; and in every inter - val of rest the rich soil brought forth its fruit an hun - dred fold , the blood-stained meadows blossomed again , and the battlefield of many nations was again the gar - den of the world . ''

		After his historical work is done , Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	refreshes himself with a chapter of modern description devoted to the Camorra of
Naples	LOCATION	and the Mafia of
Sicily	LOCATION	, about which Americans know very little beyond their names .

		The Mafia , in particular , seems to have an elastic but thoroughly efficient organization which Tammany might envy , and whose powers of terrorism will not invite travellers , in spite of the author 's comforting assurance that , ex - cept in a few dangerous localities , the traveller who has no vested interests in the islands '' may go with safety where a Sicilian nobleman or a landholder hostile to the illicit powers would need the protection of a dozen mounted car - bineers . ''

		The style throughout alternates between straightforward nervous narrative and a certain quaint artlessness , with plenty of introductory `` ands , '' quite in the manner of some monkish chronicler .

		The author has been reasonably careful in statements of fact ; but it certainly seems too strong to say -LRB- a propos of Hiero 's ship with twenty banks of oars -RRB- that '' nothing whatever is known as to the arrangement of the banks , even in the ordinary trireme '' ; and that
Breusing	PERSON	's researches have `` completely destroyed the old-fashioned belief of scholars that three banks of oars situated one above the other could under any circumstances be pulled at the same time '' -LRB- Vol .

		I. , p. 243 -RRB- .

		The statement , too , on p. 82 of Vol .

		I. , that '' nothing that
Bacchylides	PERSON	wrote has come down to us , '' was at no time exactly true ; and surely should be revised in the light of the recent discoveries .

		The volumes are handsomely printed , in uniform style with the ''
Ave Roma Immor	PERSON	- talis '' ; and the beautiful photogravures and drawings by
Brokman	PERSON	-LRB- the latter scattered through the text in rather haphazard fashion -RRB- illuminate the narrative at every turn .

		* When a man first does something very fine indeed , he may well fear or at least his friends may well fear for him that he will not be able to do something else worthy to be compared with it .

		Until we get used to it , genius so often seems accident .

		There must be some high wave which no other wave will reach .

		When
M. Rostand	PERSON	had surprised the world with '' Cyrano de Bergerac , '' it was not unnatural that the world should think that his next play could not sustain the effect .

		Nor did the advance reports entirely reas - sure the doubting .

		THE DIAL 355 And it was a play of our own century , almost our own time ; it might be brilliant , clever , emotional , but it could hardly have the true atmosphere of romance .

		Even the accounts of the play 's success in
Paris	LOCATION	were not convincing .

		Such misgivings , such doubts , were set at rest when the book itself was read , doubly buried when the play was seen .

		The book may now be read by anyone .

		The play will doubtless be widely acted , if less widely than ''
Cyrano de Bergerac	PERSON	, '' not because it is less great as a play but because it is greater .


M. Rostand	PERSON	has even bettered his first masterpiece .

		This tragedy , with its poor , weak little hero , with all its frivolity , all its decadent circum - stance , makes a stronger effect than its wonder - ful predecessor , stronger even if less obvious .

		Perhaps as one sees it in
New York	LOCATION	, not a French play given by French actors for a French audience , but simply a play like any other , perhaps one gains something which will go to make up for what is certainly lost .

		We in
America	LOCATION	can not read or see it with the feelings of those who are themselves , almost , part actors in the tragedy .

		We lose all that .

		But losing that , we can see better the wider application , the broader humanity , that is in the piece , and by that be stirred and moved to an emotion , not more genuine than the half-patriotic feeling of the Frenchman , but wider in its appeal .

		For in this young man yearning after that great inheritance which he hears , which he feels , is his , imagining it in all sorts of glittering and deceptive circumstance , treasuring scraps of others ' reminiscence , gain - ing hope from misinterpreted detail , indulging his fancy with aimless triviality , daring in ill - advised effort for he hardly knows just what , failing and surrendering himself to the inevi - table hold of current life and even death , he is not , for us , particularly the young
Napo	ORGANIZATION	- leon , he is merely what he essentially is , namely , a poignant instance of the fate that stands ready for all humanity .

		He makes , to us , an appeal which , having lost the power of a particular patriotism , has the breadth of human nature .

		He becomes one of the great characters of literature .

		Most of those who saw '' L'Aiglon '' in
New York	LOCATION	during the last month had seen not long before a new presentation of '' Hamlet . ''

		Even had they not , they would naturally have thought of the Prince of
Denmark	LOCATION	in his suit of sable , while looking upon the French prince in his Austrian white .

		Without the pretense of comparing
M. Rostand	PERSON	with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, we may still compare the great figure of Eng - lish romanticism in its heyday with this later figure of French romance .

		It is perhaps sin - gular that in an age preeminent for exuberant conception and fulfilled achievement , the great - est creation of literature should have been the man who thought too closely on the event , and kept on living to say , This thing 's to do , until circumstances took the matter out of his hands .

		Not less singular is it if either be singular at all that at the end of a century of unri - valled material achievement should come this prince who strove to realize his fancies of the truth , and failed .

		If
M. Rostand	PERSON	gives us no true ending to the play , for surely mere failure , mere death , though no doubt in this case historical enough , is still in its wider application rather too simple a solution , it is not , as we might think , because he is morbid , pessimistic , French .

		No less sane and optimistic a person than a poet laureate of
England	LOCATION	gave no better an ending to his embodiment of Soul at war with Sense .

		King
Arthur	PERSON	, wounded to death amid the wreck of his great imaginings and the ruin of his Round Table , leaving the world his mind all clouded with a doubt , is no more reassuring a figure than this little prince of fairy-land who crawls back from his first real brush with facts , to die with reminiscence of the trailing clouds of glory with which he was born .

		Neither satisfies one whose heart has been aroused to sympathy with the aspira - tion and with the struggle .

		It is a pity , cer - tainly .

		Were Shakespeare at hand to-day , perhaps he would kindly show us how the thing should have been done .

		Still , the figure is immensely interesting .

		As for the play , for the character does not necessarily make the play , one must wait till the glamor of a first reading , a first seeing , shall have worn away before we can feel at all decided as to how permanent or how great is its power .

		But the prospect is encourag - ing , and fills one with the anticipation of reassured pleasure .


EDWARD E. HALE	PERSON	, JR. .

		WE have long thought that a large illustrated history of English literature , of the type familiar upon the Continent , was a desideratum , and have noted with pleasure the recent suggestions to this effect made by Professor
Dowden	PERSON	and Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Heine	PERSON	- mann now writes to the '' Athenseum '' to say that he has for some time had such a work in preparation , under the joint authorship of Dr.
Richard Garnett	PERSON	and Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	.

		The first volume is expected to be ready during the coming year .

		356 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, Two SOUTH AMERICAN REPUBLICS .

		* The title selected by Mr.
Scruggs	PERSON	for his recent volume , `` The Colombian and
Venezue	PERSON	- lan Republics , '' must not be understood to im - ply a political or constitutional disquisition .

		The book is principally descriptive , with suffi - cient historical narrative to make clear the description .

		It combines in agreeable form the most interesting features of a gazetteer with the entertainment of a guide book .

		The author aims to place before his
North Ameri	LOCATION	- can readers precisely the elements and char - acteristics of scenery , climate , products , people , and modes of life , which those readers would most naturally seek to read or learn about in the two South American republics named .

		This object has been well accomplished .

		For it , Mr.
Scruggs	PERSON	had the exceptionally fine op - portunity of a prolonged residence as American minister to these states .

		The book evidences his special qualifications for such a task , in the keen observation which has taken note of , the shrewdness which has grasped , and the memory which has retained and reproduced the conspicuous features of South American life , society , and manners , and the capacity to portray vividly what has been seen and remem - bered .

		It is plain that Mr.
Scruggs	PERSON	is an aver - age American , who has interested himself in and has here written down those items of gen - eral information which are most likely to attract the attention and enlist the curiosity of his countrymen at home .

		Few books of this class come to us marked with more of the credentials of a sympathetic prevision of the subjects which are best calculated to suit readers in general .

		So whether it be the topography and scenery of the country ; or its natural advantages , its soil and indigenous products , its flora and fauna ; or the extent of improvements in the way of roads , highways , bridges , landscape gar - dening , or cultivation ; or the style and character of its cities , towns , villages , and plantations ; or the characteristics , habits , tastes , manners , customs , and occupations of its people , as to which the inquisitive American seeks further information , Mr.
Scruggs	PERSON	is ready to respond to the requisition .

		Many of the facts emphasized by our author are unfamiliar , and often they run counter to old traditions even if they do not surprise us .

		staple , is in its highest grade so much superior to that used in the
United States	LOCATION	, that '' we do not know what a cup of real coffee is until we visit our neighbors across the
Caribbean	LOCATION	, '' says Mr.
Scruggs	PERSON	.

		Tobacco is a native plant ; in
Bogota	LOCATION	and other towns it is universally smoked , but not chewed ; and the quality is so fine that much of this product is shipped to
Cuba	LOCATION	and there manufactured into '' clear Havanas . ''

		The potato also is indigenous .

		The oxen in the
Andes	LOCATION	are gigantic , and the native horses can not be made to trot .

		The mild and equable climate of the elevated plains in the mountains is exhilarating , and at first seems perfect , but it develops its own peculiar ail - ments , among which are an early deterioration of the normal faculties of the inhabitants , caus - ing short lives as a rule , and accompanied by a marvellous precocity in the youth .

		The pe - culiar and well-known characteristics of the higher classes among the Spanish - American peoples are in part due to climatic conditions , but are largely racial .

		In these States , as in
Central America	LOCATION	, miscegenation , practiced for centuries between whites ,
Indians	LOCATION	, and negroes , has produced several mixed races , which form so large a proportion of the population as to predominate in some of these States , and to indicate to our author that out of them all is yet to grow an entirely new '' South Amer - ican '' race .

		A flavor of political science is imparted to the book by the interesting and valuable chap - ters on the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	and its operations in
South America	LOCATION	, the
Musquito Coast	ORGANIZATION	diffi - culty ,
International Arbitration	ORGANIZATION	in general and the Arbitration of
1899	DATE	in particular ,
Democ	LOCATION	- racy in
South America	LOCATION	, Spanish-American revolutions , and the Rights of Foreigners in
South America	LOCATION	.

		The peculiar characteristic of the inhabitants which leads them into their frequent '' revolutions '' is diagnosed by Mr.
Scruggs	PERSON	as an excess of egoistic devotion to individual rights , which depreciates the value of stability in government and promotes com - petitive attempts at individual control .

		Bolivar believed in government , no less than in civil rights .

		But Bolivar was apparently one hun - dred years in advance of his fellows , and not yet are there a sufficient number of Spanish - Americans who share in this cardinal view as to the essentials of government to make it certain that any '' constitution , '' even the best , can permanently succeed in any
South American State	ORGANIZATION	.

		J THE DIAL 357 NEW TOOLS FOR BIBLE STUDENTS .

		* The three volumes noticed under this caption are popular presentations intended to embody in systematic and simple form the best results of investigations in their respective fields up to the current year .

		Professor
Riggs	PERSON	's work begins with one of the most tragic periods of Jewish history .

		The Maccabean struggle arouses the patriotic instincts of a reader as almost no other event in all history .

		Our author has carefully sifted the sources , and discussed with very fair judgment the specific value which is to be at - tached to each separate document of that age .

		The estimate of the literature and the system - atization of the facts gathered therefrom give this volume a place quite in advance of
Moss	PERSON	's `` From Malachi to
Matthew	PERSON	, '' or of Fair - weather 's `` From the Exile to the Advent . ''

		The treatment of New Testament times , while fresh and clear , carries the reader over ground that is more familiar and consequently not so novel and attractive .

		The author 's narrative shows that he was familiar with the literature of his subject , and that he had the rare gifts of being able to weigh in his own mind , and to state in good plain popular English , the results of his processes .

		The imagination is also brought into play , though not unduly , for ex - ample , in his description of the so-called ele - mentary schools of Christ 's day -LRB- pp. 132 and 238 -RRB- .

		Josephus 's writings are accorded their full meed of praise ; and the Roman literature of New Testament times is made to contribute its share to the better understanding of Pales - tine in the first century .

		The whole plan and arrangement of the book is at one with the Kent series to which it belongs .

		It is sup - plied with maps and a chart , and contains ample topical and text indices .

		These neces - sary appurtenances of a usable book , added to the admirable candor and clear narrative of the body of the work , commend this as one of the very best popular discussions of these two centuries of history .

		Jesus '' appeared in its first edition in
1896	DATE	.

		Its adaptation to the needs of students of the Scriptures has already required the issuance of a third edition .

		The most technical and schol - arly portion of the earlier editions , the Intro - duction on the Sources of the
Life of Jesus	ORGANIZATION	, is here very properly transferred to the end of the volume under the heading '' Appendix . ''

		The author has carefully distinguished between matter that is distinctly biographical and that which is doctrinal only .

		By a wise use of titled paragraphs , he has set before the reader an admirable analysis of each of his seventeen chapters .

		These paragraphs are models of expression and of statement of the case as re - quired for students .

		The text is full of refer - ences to the New Testament Gospels , and the footnotes disclose the fact that the author is familiar with the literature of his broad theme .

		Ample indices , both topical and textual , put the book at the ready command of the student .

		A couple of maps would add very much to the vividness of the narrative of chapters VI .

		- XII .

		Professor
Gilbert	PERSON	is fully abreast of the times in progressive New Testament research , and gives us here as complete a popular state - ment of the case at the close of the nineteenth century as can be found anywhere .

		Professor
Rhees	PERSON	's '' Life of Jesus of
Nazar	PERSON	- eth '' is another contribution to the more valu - able discussions of the '' Son of Man . ''

		The work covers substantially the same ground as the one just noticed .

		Its method , however , is somewhat different , and its discussion of the literature of the theme is a very valuable feat - ure .

		The point of view of the author is shown in the fact that he brings before his readers the Man Jesus as revealed in the reading of the gospels .

		The incarnation was the revela - tion of the divine through human life , and not through '' a series of propositions which formu - late truth . ''

		This was the method by which the apostles and evangelists arrived at the con - clusion that Jesus was the divine Redeemer .

		This method of the author has its manifest advantages , chief among which is the constantly growing idea of the value and importance of the truth and the supernatural character of the new Teacher .

		Professor
Rhees	PERSON	's presentation of his theme according to this principle is highly successful , and leads the reader by a very natural ascent from the child at
Nazareth	LOCATION	through the various stages of advance , until he sees the risen Man pass from
Olivet	ORGANIZATION	's heights into the heavens .

		This volume is so attrac - tively written and so richly suggestive of a 358 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, wider field of research , that many readers will eagerly turn to the apt remarks in the '' Ap - pendix '' on '' Books of Reference on the Life of Jesus , '' and select some works for more ex - tended study .

		A fine map adds to the value of the book .

		England 's naval Volume V. of the comprehensive his - struggle with tory of < - The
Royal Navy	ORGANIZATION	'' -LRB- Little ,
Napoleon	PERSON	.

		Brown ,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Wm. Laird Clowes	PERSON	and his able co-laborers , is now ready , and is distinguished from its predecessors by a certain unity of content and treatment , since it is wholly devoted to the record of the naval struggle with
Napoleon	PERSON	from
1803	DATE	to
1815	DATE	, and is entirely from the pen of Mr.
Clowes	PERSON	.

		Mr.
W. H. Wilson	PERSON	having been prevented from furnishing his allotment , namely , the story of the minor operations of the war .

		Gov - ernor
Roosevelt	PERSON	's promised account of the American war is reserved for the opening section of the forth - coming and final volume of the work .

		The central episode of the present volume is of course the cam - paign of Trafalgar , and in his observations upon this momentous action Mr.
Clowes	PERSON	has some plain truths and sobering reflections to present for the con - sideration of his countrymen , which we trust will not be lost upon them .

		Recent events have doubt - less had their effect in disabusing the minds of such Englishmen as are capable of taking a rational view of themselves , of the childish notion that one Briton is a match for three or four foreigners .

		En - gland has just succeeded in mastering , by sheer superiority of numbers , a miniature community which could not be seriously reckoned a power at all .

		Mr.
Clowes	PERSON	now calmly tells his readers : `` Most of our great victories have been gained by superiority of numbers '' ; and he goes on to say that the victory of Trafalgar was due , not to superior foresight or strategy or bravery , but to the pres - ence with the British fleet of a sailor of genius , whose like
England	LOCATION	will probably not see again .

		Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	's forthcoming account of the naval actions of the war of
1812	DATE	which account we sincerely trust will be free from the spirit of boast - fulness must also set forth some salutary facts for British contemplation .

		No intelligent person , of course , will question English valor , since its praise is written in all true history , and its traces are manifest in all parts of the globe .

		But it is time for
England	LOCATION	to put away the silly notion that foreigners , qua foreigners , are comparative weak - lings whom she has always beaten and can always beat in equal fight .

		The conceit is ridiculous , Chinese , and retarding ; and it has certainly con - tributed to recent humiliation -LRB- in the end no bad thing , perhaps -RRB- and defeat .

		The lesson of Trafal - gar , thinks Mr.
Clowes	PERSON	, is -LRB- since
England	LOCATION	can not hope to have a
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	for each hour of emergency -RRB- `` that
Great Britain	LOCATION	, instead of relying upon any supposed superiority of her sons , and instead of trusting to find a
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	when he is needed , should take care always to have the bigger battalions on her side .

		With the bigger battalions , and with officers and men as good as those of any other nations , she may count on holding her own . ''

		Such sober and practical words as these are timely at a period of restless militarism and boundless aggression , when it may be said almost without challenge that every considerable power , save perhaps two , and certainly one , would regard with satisfaction En - gland 's definitive humiliation and relegation to the second rank a contingency which no thoughtful American of English blood can bear to contemplate seriously for a moment .

		Mr.
Clowes	PERSON	' volume is an unusually interesting number of the work , and its illustrations are up to the u * ual high standard .

		Biography of Seldom is a biographer so favored
Henry George	PERSON	, as
Henry George , Jr.	PERSON	, has been in by M am .

		preparing the life of his distin - guished father .

		That there should have been jour - nals left containing much material , that letters and newspaper clippings should abound , that friends should be many and admirers and followers a host , are of minor consequence when the fact of the younger Mr.
George	PERSON	's profound sympathy and intimacy with the career that promises so much for humanity is taken into full account .

		It is rare that two succeeding generations attain such loving and intellectual companionship .

		Almost rarer is the feeling prevailing through the book , which has scorned concealment of a hundred little things that go to show how intensely human were all of
Henry George	PERSON	's characteristics , foibles , and aspirations alike .

		Born in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	on
September 2 , 1839	DATE	, dying in
New York City	LOCATION	in the most dramatic manner , still vividly in the public mind , on
October 29 , 1897	DATE	,
Henry George	PERSON	lived a most human life , as we see it painted here .

		No attempt is made in this biography to hide the trifling follies of youth , the more serious mistakes of manhood .

		On the contrary , the steps by which the elder
George	PERSON	came to a full comprehension of his relations to his fellows is depicted in great de - tail , enabling the reader to pass with him from the common American indifference to everything but worldly success into that better knowledge which makes the deprivation of a single citizen the con - cern of the entire Republic .

		The birth and growth of the idea which was known later as the `` Single Tax , '' and the singular receptiveness of its re-dis - coverer to the claims of priority on the part of others , are intensely interesting and interpretative as told in the younger Mr.
George	PERSON	's pages .

		Food for reflection , too , is given by the attitude toward university training , which the economist thought almost fatal to independence in investigation .

		THE DIAL 359 Th mended .

		Alike for its subject and its treatment , `` The Life of Henry George '' -LRB-
Doubleday & McClure Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a welcome contribution to biog - raphy .

		With technical art criticism , Arch - er / ' `` deacon
Farrar	PERSON	's scholarly work on '' The Life of Christ as Represented in Art '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has admittedly little to do .

		The theme is treated from the religious and his - torical view-point , and the aim of the author is in the main to enable his readers to understand and feel the power of those mighty sermons preached by the great religious painters to men of their own generation , and which to the great mass of men of ours are locked in an unknown tongue .

		In these grand works of a devout and believing age lie sources of enduring delight and consolation to all who can look upon them with the seeing eye ; and it is in the hope of increasing the number of those capable of this high and improving pleasure that
Dean Farrar	PERSON	has written .

		He has also endeavored to indicate how the worth and dignity of religious painting has fluctuated with the varying sincerity of the periods of its production for Art can not deceive , but invariably betrays herself when at - tempting to express emotions that she does not feel .

		Dean
Farrar	PERSON	's book is the record mainly of his own impressions and reflections , and while not always convincing in its defense of the thesis that the worth of a painting varies directly with the depth of the religious sentiment of its producer -LRB- a propo - sition which seems to leave too far out of the count the supreme importance of mastery of technique -RRB- , it is a most valuable aid to the enjoyment of the more spiritual qualities of the masterpieces it de - scribes .

		The illustrations , consisting of twenty - three full-page plates and a great number of well - chosen and instructive drawings in the text , are largely taken from the great Italians of the four - teenth and fifteenth centuries , the Dutch , Germans , and
Flemings	ORGANIZATION	being less fully represented , and the Spaniards , except
Velasquez	PERSON	, scarcely at all .

		A few examples from modern painters
Rossetti	PERSON	, Hunt ,

Edmund Noble	ORGANIZATION	's ``
Russia	LOCATION	and the Russians '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
M.fflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		In no other book on this vexed topic do we remember noting so complete a mingling of the good and bad , leaving the reader with a sense of reality and humanity as assuring as it is unusual .

		By far the greater part of the American nation regards the great empire of the Tsar with frank good will , tempered by a knowl - edge of its despotism and illiberally toward political thought .

		This sentiment probably had its origin in the kindly action of
Russia	LOCATION	during the Trent episode of our Civil War , strengthened through the lapsing years by many other indications of hospitality and friendship .

		The rising in the
United States	LOCATION	of a party confessedly Anglophilic in these later days makes it the more needful that the truth should be told , to allay the assertions of partisans on both sides .

		This is Mr.
Noble	PERSON	's task , and he has ac - quitted himself well .

		In its newness ,
America	LOCATION	has many things in common with
Russia	LOCATION	, and more than one change in our recent governmental policies has had the Russian flavor .

		Both nations , as we see clearly in these pages , have all the world before them in which to choose , with
Russia	LOCATION	committed to a policy which has already outstripped her present powers of assimilation , benevolent or otherwise .

		The
Russia of Count Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's recent novel , the
Russia	LOCATION	of Mr.
George Kennan	PERSON	, are to be seen in Mr.
Noble	PERSON	's book beside the land of intense patriot - ism and self-seeking which is contesting with
Great Britain	LOCATION	for the supremacy of the world .

		The book is to be highly commended to those seeking truth rather than a confirmation of existing prejudices .

		Books relating to the stage are grow - s more iQ demand each y ear - due perhaps to the fact that the natural curiosity of the play-loving public has usu - ally been incited by fancies rather than satisfied by facts . '

		The Theatre and Its People '' -LRB-
Doubleday , Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is in many respects unlike any other book , and may be regarded as a sort of theatrical vade-mecum .

		Mr.
Franklin Fyles	PERSON	, the author , is dramatic critic of the
New York	LOCATION	'' Sun , '' and him - self a dramatist of no mean skill .

		His information , therefore , comes from the inside ; and to those who are unfamiliar with stage life unfamiliar with the theatrical business and profession as pursued in
America	LOCATION	to-day the volume will prove interesting and valuable .

		It treats such subjects as the mak - ing of actors , theatrical managers , the writing of plays , authors ' gains and losses , rehearsals , first nights , stage fright , life behind the scenes , etc. , in such a way as to convey a specific knowledge of the subject to convey the truth plainly , rather than to create illusions or destroy them .

		When we con - sider that there are five thousand theatres in the
United States	LOCATION	counting all kinds , that not less than one and one-half million persons sit in these theatres each week-day night in a season of at least eight months , that
seventy-five millions of dollars	MONEY	-LRB- a con - servative estimate -RRB- are paid by Americans each year for theatrical amusement , we realize the scope and interest of Mr.
Fyles	PERSON	's treatise .

		The volume con - tains many appropriate illustrations .

		It has been pointed out that musical T biography labors under two conspicu - ous disadvantages : the customary absence of interesting details in the lives of eminent musicians , and the lack of biographers who have sufficient literary resources to enable them to use to the best advantage such materials as their subjects 360 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, afford .

		Miss
Rosa Newrnarch	PERSON	, in her biography of Tchaikovsky -LRB-
John Lane	PERSON	-RRB- , traces the life of the melancholy Russian musician whose emotional and romantic despair seemed to belong to other times and other lands to echo Chateaubriand and
Byron	PERSON	rather than
Gogol	PERSON	and Tourgue ` nief in a manner highly commendable .

		The volume is entertaining , notwithstanding the axiom that to write technically about music is to render one 's self unintelligible to all but musicians .

		Though the best known among Russian composers ,
Tchaikovsky	ORGANIZATION	was by no means the greatest .

		It is true that he was '' a poet of one mood in all his lays , '' but he was not , like
Glinka	PERSON	, or in a less degree like Rimsky-Korsakov , conse - crated to the service of nationality ; as a result of this , his works are popular with the English audi - ence , and his death , which occurred six years ago , is to be lamented .

		As a musical critic he was well known in his own country ; those extracts from his writings which are reproduced in this volume are chiefly valuable because they throw some light upon his personal tastes and the tendencies which influ - enced his music .

		The '' Diary of My Tour Abroad in
1888	DATE	, '' a modest record of concerts given and operas conducted by
Tchaikovsky	ORGANIZATION	, closes the vol - ume .

		One thing is omitted which invariably proves convenient in any lengthy biography an index .

		Denizens of our woods and fields d en FeatLn r find a worthy advocate in Mr.
John Burroughs	PERSON	, who , in his '' Squirrels and other Fur-bearers '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , recounts his experiences with them and their cunning ways .

		His simple tales lend something of a human inter - est to the lives of these humble creatures , and it is to be hoped that the influence of this book will tend to abate the fierce and bloody warfare of ex - termination which man so relentlessly wages upon them with trap and gun .

		Indeed , every reader should become a friend of all squirrels and chip - munks , of the rabbit and the hare , of the fox and the mink , and even of the little brown mice .

		The book is limited in scope , in large part , to the per - sonal observations of the author on the smaller and better known mammals of the forests of the eastern part of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		But this limit affords room enough for a very interesting and most read - able book .

		Fifteen plates after
Audubon	ORGANIZATION	, and an original frontispiece , all in color , adorn the work .

		In these days of many bird books , novelty either in subject or treatment is a matter of prime im - portance .

		The birds of English gardens and moors and meadows have been the theme of many writers , but none , perhaps , has dealt with the subject in so original and fresh a manner as
Miss Pollard	PERSON	in her '' Birds of My Parish '' -LRB-
John Lane	PERSON	-RRB- .

		This is a book of avian small talk , in which the birds themselves do the most of the chattering with a wholesome disregard of the conventionalities of all well-ordered ornithologies .

		A deal of information about English birds and their habits is here presented in a very entertaining manner .

		The most utejui
Ifc	ORGANIZATION	is difficult to realize that '' Web - single volume ster 's International Dictionary ''
Engh	PERSON	, h dictionary .

		-LRB-
Merriam	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is already ten years old .

		We are reminded of that fact by the appearance of a new edition , printed from new plates throughout , and embodying a great quantity of entirely new matter .

		Although we have always objected seri - ously to the Websterian orthography , it has no doubt become largely mitigated by its many later concessions to an enlightened taste , and some of its vagaries have become in a way mellowed by usage .

		And there can be no doubt that the famous u Dic - tionary '' is still , as it has remained for many years , the most useful one-volume work of its kind in the language .

		The chief special feature of this latest revision of the work is provided by the Supplement of 238 pages , which is bound in at the end of the volume , in addition to the upwards of two thousand pages which preserve the general arrangement and contents of the earlier edition .

		This additional section , which has been prepared under the direc - tion of Dr.
William T. Harris	PERSON	, gives us a new vocabulary of about twenty-five thousand words , which have been treated by a numerous committee of the most competent specialists in the several departments of knowledge concerned .

		Here we find not only technical , dialectical , and exotic words , in great numbers , but also many hitherto obsolete words that have been given renewed cur - rency by our modern writers .

		In short , the new ''
Webster	PERSON	'' is even more indispensable than ever among the furnishings of the office , the library , the school , and the home .

		The well printed , generously illus - trated book entitled `` Historic Towns _ .

		of the
Southern States	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- Putnam -RRB- completes the triad of volumes on American His - toric Towns , and crowns an enterprise which can - not be too highly commended by all who have at heart the interests of American history and histor - ical research .

		If it is possible to pick out flaws and inadequacies in this useful little series -LRB- which we should like to see extended -RRB- , it is , on the other hand , easy to point out merits in it ; and publishers , editors , and contributors are on the whole to be congratulated on the outcome of their efforts .

		The present volume , which opens with a compre - hensive Introduction by Professor
W. P. Trent	PERSON	, treats of eighteen of the older Southern towns
Baltimore	LOCATION	,
Washington	LOCATION	,
Richmond	LOCATION	,
Charleston	LOCATION	,
Savannah	LOCATION	, Mobile ,

		The book is a taking one externally , and contains many drawings , full-page and vignette , of the right `` outing '' flavor .

		h j g way with h j s 8er j e8 Q -LCB- 8tudieg m historical biography , the volume this time treating of ``
Napoleon III	PERSON	.

		at the Height of his Power '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		The book is , like the others , attrac - tively written , and there are many well-drawn por - traits and interesting extracts from contemporary writings , official and private .

		The period covered begins with the year 1860 , or the close of the Franco-Austrian war over the Italian question , and closes with the signing of the Treaty of
Pekin	LOCATION	at the end of the year .

		There are four portraits
Pius fX.	PERSON	,
General de Lamoriciere	ORGANIZATION	,
Francis II	PERSON	.

		of
Naples	LOCATION	, and
Garibaldi	PERSON	.

		The good work of the com - petent translator , Mrs.
Elizabeth Gilbert Martin	PERSON	, calls for a further word of praise .

		Good counsel `` Counsel upon the Reading of upon the reading Books '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the title of a pleasant little volume that we take pleasure in commending .

		It is the outcome of a course of Extension lectures given in
Philadelphia	LOCATION
two years ago	DATE	, and differs from most books about reading in combining specific recommendations with its general advice .

		Six subjects are discussed , in as many lectures , by specialists who know how to make their pleas both practical and eloquent .

		Professor
Morse Stephens	PERSON	writes of history ; Miss Repplier of memoirs and biographies ; President
Hadley	PERSON	of sociology , economics , and politics ; Professor
Brander Matthews	PERSON	of fiction ; Professor
Bliss Perry	PERSON	of poetry ; and Mr.
H. W. Mabie	PERSON	of essay and criticism .

		Thus various points of view are presented , and the conclusions reached do not always agree , but the discussion is throughout urbane , scholarly , and deserving of respect .

		Mr.
Perry	PERSON	's paper on poetry seems to us particularly deserving of praise , for so much sound doctrine combined with pleasant writing is not often packed within the limits of a single hour 's discourse .

		We should not neglect to add a word of praise for the preface , contributed to the volume by Dr.
Henry Van Dyke	PERSON	.

		Brady s spirited collection of war stories , `` American Fights and Fight - ers '' -LRB-
McClure	ORGANIZATION	,
Phillips & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , makes a strong bid for popular favor at a time when wars and ru - mors of wars are many , and the man of peace , with his old-fashioned notions and New Testament prejudices , is almost looked upon as out of date .

		The clergy have caught the common infection ; and even the kindly Mr.
Brady	PERSON	, the author of our present volume , lends his pen rather to painting the romantic and heroic side of war than to pointing the stern if unwelcome moral that '' War is hell . ''

		But it would be hardly fair to find fault with Mr.
Brady	PERSON	for not turning into peace sermons his ring - ing tales of the exploits of Jones ,
Decatur	LOCATION	,
Barney	LOCATION	, and Truxton , of
Greene	LOCATION	,
Putnam	LOCATION	,
Morgan	ORGANIZATION	, Stark ,
Wayne	PERSON	, and
Jackson	PERSON	.

		The contents of the book are divided into five main sections , Part I. dealing with the War of the Revolution , Part II .

		with the Indian war in the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	,
Part III	ORGANIZATION	.

		with the War with
France	LOCATION	, Part IV .

		with the War with
Tripoli	LOCATION	, and Part V. with the War of
1812	DATE	.

		The book is meant for popular reading , and is well cal - culated to stimulate patriotism of the sort it appeals to .

		There are a number of illustrations , mainly from old prints .

		.

		Close upon the heels of Mr.
Buell	PERSON	's noteworthy two-volume life of
Paul Jones	PERSON	follows Mr.
Cyrus Townsend Brady	PERSON	's '' Commodore
Paul Jones	PERSON	, '' a desirable volume in the useful '' Great Commanders Series '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- .

		Mr.
Brady	PERSON	's spirited book evinces care in preparation , and covers satisfactorily the main events of Jones 's public career .

		It is written from the view-point of an ardent admirer ; but the author has satisfied himself through due examina - tion of the records that his praises are well bestowed .

		Mr.
Brady	PERSON	's animated style and exuberant patriot - ism makes his book an attractive one for young readers .

		The volume contains a frontispiece por - trait and several explanatory cuts .


Paul Jones	PERSON	as a '' Great Commander .

		SOME time ago we acknowledged the receipt of two volumes in the edition of
Lockhart	PERSON	's '' Life of

		Two new editions of Borrow will bring joy to the hearts of Borrovians .

		The edition published by the Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	occupies four stout volumes , rather too bulky for comfortable reading , but making a dig - nified showing on the library shelf .

		The editing pur - ports to be by Professor
Knapp	PERSON	, although in the case of one volume , `` The Bible in
Spain	LOCATION	, '' we see no signs of his work .

		The other titles are Lavengro , '' '' The
Romany Rye	PERSON	, '' and `` The Gypsies of
Spain	LOCATION	. ''

		Mr.
John Lane	PERSON	's edition is in five much smaller volumes , not ac - credited to any editorial hand , and seeming to be simple reprints . ''

		Wild Wales '' provides the contents of the fifth volume .

		We have already had more than one occasion to praise that exhaustive guide-book and rich repository of old memories , Mr.
Samuel Adams Drake	PERSON	's '' Old Land - marks and Historic Personages of
Boston	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		For the reader who wishes to get at second-hand a view of historic and storied
Boston	LOCATION	, and for the tourist who wants a guide to what cultivated people think best worth seeing in
Boston	LOCATION	, Mr.
Drake	PERSON	's is distinctly the indispensable book .

		A new and revised edition of the work is now issued , containing all the old cuts and a number of new ones .

		Boxed together as a set come the five initial volumes in the `` Riverside Aldine Classics '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , namely , ''
Evangeline	PERSON	, '' '' The One
Hoss Shay	PERSON	, '' '' Snow - Bound , '' '' Sir Launfal , '' and
Hawthorne	PERSON	's '' Legend of
Province House	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		This neat , well-printed , inexpensive series is intended to include examples of the best American prose and verse .

		Special attention is paid to form and typography , the design being to follow the models and abide by the traditions of the older presses whose names stand for sound workmanship and quiet elegance .

		Each volume contains a frontispiece .

General Physics	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Professor
George A. Hoadley	PERSON	.

		It is a text - book of the conventional modern type , with full provision for such individual work and labo - ratory exercises as are within the reach of secondary students .

		The '' Elements of Physics , '' prepared by Dr.
C. Hanford Henderson	PERSON	and Dr.
John F. Woodhull	PERSON	for the '' Twentieth Century '' series of the Messrs.
Appleton	PERSON	is , on the other hand , somewhat unconven - tional in treatment , and prefers to relegate laboratory work to a special volume .

		We welcome particularly such departures from custom as the insertion of a series of full-page portraits with biographical sketches .

		Nor is the history of the science neglected , but receives attention at many points .

		We commend also the special chapter on music at the close of the volume .

		The annual report for

Smithsonian Institution	ORGANIZATION	is a volume of over thirteen hundred pages , and devoted almost wholly to a single monograph , by the late
Edward D. Cope	PERSON	, upon `` The Crocodilians , Lizards , and Snakes of
North America	LOCATION	. ''

		So important a work as this has not often been found even in the publications of the
Institute	ORGANIZATION	, and naturalists will wel - come such an addition to the fundamental literature of their subject .

		Among the new books about to be issued from the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	are '' The Oxford Book of English Verse , 1250-1900 , '' poems chosen and edited by Mr.

		The '' Century Classics , '' a new series of reprints begun by the
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	, are in every way dignified and attractive in execution .

		Each volume has a por - trait frontispiece and an introductory essay by a good critical authority .

		The volumes are smaller than those of the M , ic mil Ian series of similar scope , and the price is lower .

		The six volumes thus far issued , and their editors , are as follows : Bacon 's Essays , by Professor
G. E. Wood	PERSON	berry ;
Herrick	ORGANIZATION	's Poems , by Mr.
T. B. Aldrich	PERSON	; '' The Pilgrim 's Progress , '' by Bishop
Potter	PERSON	;
Defoe	PERSON	's Plague Journal , by Sir

		Messrs.

		They are '' The Early Poems of

C. G. Crump	PERSON	;
Gibbons	PERSON	' `` Memoirs , '' edited by Dr.
G. Birkbeck Hill	PERSON	; and an Italian text of '' The Divine Comedy , '' edited by Mr.
Paget Toynbee	PERSON	.

		Something like forty more volumes are already an - nounced for this series , which is likely to prove a seri - ous rival to the
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	'' Library of English Classics '' and the '' Century Classics . ''

		Still another school history of American Literature has come to our desk , the work of Professor
Walter C. Bronson	PERSON	, published by
Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		While no better and no worse than two or three others that might be named , this book has a certain individ - uality , based in part upon the author 's first-hand study of the earlier period , with all the advantages offered by the
Harris	PERSON	collection at
Brown University	ORGANIZATION	.

		His discussion keeps in touch with social conditions and the general intellectual movement of the century , which is a commendable feature .

		The method is that of the essay , with biographies and bibliographies relegated to the position of foot-notes .

		An appendix gives some highly interesting excerpts from Colonial and Revolu - tionary writings .

		If the effect of Christmas could be depended upon to last into
summer	DATE	, this would be a very different sort of world , ' says Miss
Trum	PERSON	- bull .

		Perhaps it does last far enough to prevent the possibility of a critical attitude towards a Christmas story in early autumn .

		Let the cruel turn gentle , the miser prodigal , and the curmudgeon take on a heart of graciousness , on the
evening	TIME	of
December 24	DATE	, we shall find no improbability , moral or liter - ary , herein .

		If it is not so , it ought to be so , and Christmas stories may help to make it so .

		This much for the sketch which gives
Miss Trumbull	ORGANIZATION	's volume its name .

		Its followers are of varying interest and merit , an especial charm attaching to the ` Memoir of
Mary Twining	PERSON	, * a portrait of a last-century girl in delicately sombre tints .

		Some

		There are one or two pieces in the book of exquisite prose .

		Folio ,
$ 25.00	MONEY	net .

		IN this magnificent work Sir
Walter Armstrong	PERSON	has produced a biography of the first President of the
Royal Academy	ORGANIZATION	in which Sir
Joshua	PERSON	's life is sketched in sufficient , though by no means exhaustive , detail , more attention being paid to the characteristics of the man himself than to the more or less accidental events in which he was concerned .

		To this the author has added a careful critical estimate of Sir
Joshua	PERSON	's art and of his influence both on the English school and on modern painting in general .

		In selecting the pictures for reproduction , care has been taken to choose those which most fully illustrate
Reynolds	PERSON	's development , and to prefer , where possible , less known and less readily accessible examples to those in public galleries .

		The unstinted praise given to the author 's `` Life of Gainsborough '' both as far as scholarship is concerned and also on account of its exquisite manufacture can not be denied in an equal measure to his `` Life of Sir
Joshua Reynolds	PERSON	, '' which is equally liberally illustrated and sumptuously printed .

		Mr.

		In the preparation of this masterly treatise he has not only examined the entire accessible published literature in various languages bearing on the subject , but has spent years in the study of innumerable manuscripts embraced in the collections of the
Vatican	ORGANIZATION	and other libraries .

		He has exposed many an idle legend which was thought to have some foundation , and has likewise transferred much that has been deemed conjectural to the realm of undoubted historic reality .

		Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	's work is on a novel plan .

		Taking up
Franklin	PERSON	's life in
1775	DATE	, when the autobiography closes , Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	carries the narrative on by quoting from
Franklin	PERSON	's letters and writings : '' And as few other eminent men have written as complete a record of bis own life , the main trouble of the writer has been the fullness of material . ''

		The new -LRB- fourth -RRB- edition is required by the fact that every new year seems to have something fresh to tell us of the subject of this memoir .

		Like his eminent contemporary and admirer ,
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	,
Franklin	PERSON	's fountain of pieces in ` edites seems inexhaustible .

		Scarcely a month passes that does not make its contribution to the fruitage of his indefatigable pen .

		It is is now twenty-six years since the first edition of this memoir was given to the world .

		Time and the public taste have vindicated the artistic principle upon which it was constructed of letting
Franklin	PERSON	tell his story , and his whole story , in his own way .

		Franklin was not only his own but practically his only biographer ; his own account of himself is the one in which the world must always feel most interest ; and whatever other biographies have been or may be written , there must always be a demand for the
Life of Franklin	ORGANIZATION	as written by himself so long as the English language continues to be a living tongue .

		At the publisher 's behest , therefore , the author has undertaken to enrich a new edition of this memoir with whatever fresh material of bio - graphical interest the last decade has disclosed , in the hope of leaving it as perfect and complete an expression of
Franklin	PERSON	's own estimate of himself , of his principles , and of his motives of action as it is now possible to supply .

		We believe that such men have a mission for all branches of the Christian church .

		To others it may be given to lead the church out into the field of social problems ; to still others the duty falls of helping to elucidate the biblical and theological problems of our age ; but surely no speakers and no writers can put Christians generally under greater obligations than those who bring a message to that which is deepest and best in our personal life with Christ .

Guido F. Verbeck	PERSON	was one of the greatest of the makers of the new
Japan	LOCATION	.

		He taught in his early years scores of men who became the first in the government after the Emperor , and consequently all his life had almost unbounded influence with
Japan	LOCATION	's statesmen iu securing toleration of Christianity , in stopping persecutions , in getting wise and humane laws enacted , in first proposing embassies abroad and in found - ing and carrying on the
Imperial University	ORGANIZATION	in its early stages , and in introducing a national system of education .

		In the early days , before the Japanese could obtain expert advice , he was the government 's fac - totum .

		During all of these years he was an active missionary in his own home , and became evangelist and preacher and Bible translator .

		The emperor of
Japan	LOCATION	paid his funeral expenses , ordered his highest officers to attend the funeral , sent his soldiers to escort the body to the grave , and Japanese money from hundreds of admiring pupils aud friends built the memorial over his grave .

		The book gives a true picture of his life as the nursing father of the nation .

		440 THE GENTLE READER .

		Among the many agreeable features of the holiday season , now so swiftly approaching , there is none more pleasant than the making of gifts .

		The truly human being , who feels himself no isolated unit in the total of con - scious existence , but rather a creature linked to his fellows by the countless ties of sympa - thetic association , takes a greater delight in preparing holiday surprises for those who are dear to him than he does in the anticipation of the satisfactions that may reasonably be expected to accrue to his own existence .

		It is pleasant to dwell in thought upon the coming days of relaxation , with their good cheer for mind and body alike , but it is even more pleas - ant to make little plans for the happiness of others , and to select for them those small mementoes which mean so much for the tastes and the affections , however slight may be the estimate set upon them in the market-place .

		Among these remembrances , the tokens by which we express ourselves far more effectively than by means of any words , there are none more important than books , for there are none that are possessed of so much of the spiritual or symbolic value that we should always seek to embody in our gifts .

		However limited may be our resources , they are sufficient to compass the procuring of the richest treasures of the spirit as it is revealed in literary art .

		Nor is there need to be ashamed of the setting provided for these jewels , for the arts that be - long to bookmaking , as distinguished from the art of the writer of books , have grown in - creasingly worthy of their task , and so cun - 414 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, ningly fit the page to the margin , so tastefully fit the cover to the pages , so harmoniously fit the decoration to the covers , that all the aesthetic sensibilities are gratified at once , and we marvel that it should be possible to offer so much of the product of refined taste at so absurdly small a price .

		The majority of books , of course , do not meet these conditions , being strictly commer - cial products for the consumption of
Philis	LOCATION	- tines ; but the wonder remains that so many books should meet them so successfully ; for to the book-lover of nice discrimination , after putting aside the countless impossible objects in the guise of books that are everywhere thrust upon his attention , there still remains the embarrassment of choice among the really desirable editions that offer him so much more than mere muslin and paper and print .

		Would he purchase a Shakespeare or a
Dickens	LOCATION	, a
Walton	PERSON	or a
Boswell	ORGANIZATION	, or even so modern a classic as a '' Marius '' or an ''
Omar	PERSON	, '' he is fairly bewildered by the charms of at least three or four editions , each of which seems at the moment of examination more wholly desir - able than any other .

		And when the choice is reluctantly made , his memory lingers regret - fully over the claims of the rejected rivals for his favor , leaving him not quite sure that he has chosen wisely after all .

		In making these remarks , we have had in mind , as chiefly deserving of consideration , the type of book-lover whom it was once the cus - tom to designate as '' the gentle reader . ''

		The type is an old-fashioned one , but it happily remains persistent , although seemingly crowded aside by the enormous recent expansion of the reading public as a whole .

		The gentle reader is essentially a reader of good old books rather than of ephemeral new ones .

		He is apt to look with suspicion upon the celebrities that are exploited by publishers and newspapers day after day , and to give thanks that he has learned to eschew the counsel of these '' blind mouths , '' that he has long since found his way to the perennial sources of literary enjoyment .

		He is still with us , for his tastes are still con - sulted by our purveyors of books , and the very publishers who strive eagerly with one another for the acquisition of the latest novels by the latest notorieties take also good heed to provide their lists with reprints of the old established favorites .

		The many libraries of standard lit - erature which are so characteristic a feature of publishing at the present time surely answer to a genuine demand , and that demand as surely testifies to the fact that the gentle reader is in - sisting that his interests shall not be neglected .

		We had just got fairly started upon this train of reflection when we came across an analysis of the tastes and the temper of the gentle reader so genial and so sympathetic that we were tempted to make a forced loan for the relief of our own poverty of expres - sion .

		This temptation overcome , we must at least make a reference to the article by the Eev .

		Mr.
Crothers	PERSON	in the
November	DATE	`` Atlan - tic , '' which reveals to the gentle reader his own true self , and explains the workings of his mind so delightfully that even the reader of another sort may come to understand some - thing of it , and experience yearnings to be himself numbered among the gentle .

		But if we may not borrow from Mr.
Crothers	PERSON	, we will at least borrow from the Rev.
Henry Van Dyke	PERSON	, who has recently paid his compli - ments to the gentle reader .

		After dismissing the '' simple reader '' and the '' intelligent reader '' as obviously hopeless , this writer sets forth the characteristics of the gentle reader so charmingly and with such insight that we at once feel sure that he knows whereof he speaks . ''

		The gentle reader , '' he says , '' is the person who wants to grow , and who turns to books as a means of purifying his tastes , deepening his feelings , broadening his sympathies , and enhancing his joy in life .

		Litera - ture he loves because it is the most humane of the arts .

		Its forms and processes interest him as expressions of the human striving towards clearness of thought , pur - ity of emotion , and harmony of action with the ideal . ''

		But better than any characterization of the gentle reader better even than Dr.
Van Dyke	PERSON	's analysis , is the concrete example offered by many a man of letters who has taken the public into his intimacy , and helped us to feel and to share his delight in good literature .

		Emerson and
Lowell	LOCATION	, Lamb and
FitzGerald	PERSON	, were gentle readers of the most typical sort , and their success in the vocation was complete .

		When Mr.
James Lane Allen	PERSON	interrupts the course of a novel to bring in whole pages of
Malory	LOCATION	, we instantly know him for a gentle reader .

		Others , again , seem to have the desire to be gentle readers , but the true vocation is lacking .

		Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	was too intolerant of opinions not his own to become one , and Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	, try as hard as he may to get in , is kept outside the sanctuary by what may be called the strenuosity of his positivism .

		He makes a valiant plea for all good books , but we feel while he is making it that they have appealed to his intelligence , and in - directly , by virtue of their significance for the
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 415 history of culture , and not directly by virtue of their quality of deep human sympathy .

		On the other hand , we know
FitzGerald	PERSON	as a genuine member of the guild from almost any random page of his familiar correspon - dence .

		By way of bonnes bouches , and as the best possible illustration of our text , let us close by extracting a passage or two from the letters in which his quality as a bookman is most clearly exhibited . ''

		I am now a good deal about in a new Boat I have built , and thought -LRB- as
Johnson	PERSON	took
Cocker 's Arithmetic	ORGANIZATION	with him on travel , because he should n't exhaust it -RRB- so I would take
Dante	PERSON	and Homer with me , instead of
Mudie	PERSON	's Books , which I read through directly .

		I took
Dante	ORGANIZATION	by way of slow Digestion : not having looked at him for some years : but I am glad to find I relish him as much as ever : he atones with the Sea ; as you know does the Odyssey these are the Men ! '' ''

		I wonder whether old Seneca was indeed such a humbug as people now say he was : he is really a fine writer .

		About three hundred years ago , or less , our divines and writers called him the divine
Seneca	LOCATION	; and old
Bacon	ORGANIZATION	is full of him .

		One sees in him the upshot of all the Greek philosophy , how it stood in
Nero	LOCATION	's time , when the Gods had worn out a good deal .

		I do n't think old Seneca believed he should live again .

		Death is his great resource .

		Think of the rococosity of a gentleman studying Seneca in the middle of
February 1844	DATE	in a remarkably damp cottage . '' ''

		I can not get on with Books about the Daily Life which I find rather insufferable in practice about me .

		I never could read
Miss Austen	PERSON	, nor -LRB- later -RRB- the famous
George Eliot	PERSON	.

		Give me People , Places , and Things , which I do n't and ca n't see ; Antiquaries ,
Jeanie Deans	PERSON	,
Dalgettys	LOCATION	, & c .

		As to
Thackeray	PERSON	's , they are terrible ; I really look at them on the shelf , and am half afraid to touch them .

		He , you know , could go deeper into the Springs of Common Action than these Ladies : wonderful he is , but not Delightful , which one thirsts for as one gets old and dry . '' ''

		Of course the Man must be a Man of Genius to take his Ease : but , if he be , let him take it .

		I suppose that such as
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, and
Milton	PERSON	, and my Daddy , took it far from easy : well , they dwell apart in the Empyrean ; but for Human Delight ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Cervantes	PERSON	,
Boccaccio	PERSON	, and
Scott	PERSON	. ''

		It is worth while to be able to read books in the spirit of the writer of these passages , worth while even at the expense of a few crotchets and a certain amount of irrationality .

		And it is also worth while to learn the lesson of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's absolute sincerity in stating his likes and dislikes .

		If our personal judgments are in line with the established verdict of criticism , well and good ; but if they are not , there is no virtue in pretending to the contrary .

		The gentle reader , at least , whatever his faults , knows the things he likes , and they are pretty apt to be the things that the world has agreed with him in liking .

		RECORDS or COLONIAL TIMES AND MANNERS .

		* Books on Colonial times continue to appear , and of such good ones as Miss
Helen Evertson Smith	PERSON	's '' Colonial Days and Ways , '' now be - fore us , there can hardly be too many .

		Readers of
Marion Harland	PERSON	's popular '' Colonial Home - steads '' may remember her account of the rich accumulation of family papers , '' hampers , corded boxes , and trunks full of them , '' stored away for generations in the spacious garret of a certain old mansion , the
Smith	ORGANIZATION	homestead , at
Sharon	ORGANIZATION	,
Connecticut	LOCATION	.

		These papers , includ - ing many thousands of letters , with diaries , legal writings , account-books , and so on , form a ramifying chronicle covering the years ex - tending from the landings of the earlier immi - grants in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	and
Connecticut	LOCATION	, down to the middle of the present century .

		In ex - ploiting these documents , some of which turn out to be of rather exceptional historical or pictorial value ,
Miss Smith	ORGANIZATION	has lent her pen , not merely to the naturally congenial task of compiling the annals of the Sharon branch of the extensive house of
Smith	ORGANIZATION	, but also to the more weighty and useful one of constructing , on the ex pede Herculem principle , from the memorials of a representative family a general picture of the domestic ways and economy of the class of Colonial society to which the family belonged .

		Nor has
Miss Smith	ORGANIZATION	been content , like some of her predecessors , with merely skimming the cream of her material , and mak - ing a book of extracts .

		Coming of composite English-Dutch-Hugue - not stock , the author 's ancestral papers reflect by turns something of the ways of each of these three components of our early popula - tion , and not of the Puritan element alone .

		The narrative proper begins with Chapter III. , mainly an account of a pioneer pastor of
Wethersfield	LOCATION	,
Connecticut	LOCATION	, and containing , as the piece de resistance in the way of quota - tions , a letter written in
1698	DATE	, descriptive of early days in
Wethersfield	LOCATION	.

		Trying times awaited the good man in his new pastorate .

		His son writes : '' Concerning of ye earlie days , I can remember but little save Hardship .

		My Parents had broughte bothe Men Servants and Maid Servants from
England	LOCATION	, but ye Maids tarried not but till they got married , ye wch was shortly , for there was great scarcity of Women in ye Colonies ... Ye firste

My Father ever declardt there would not be so much to feare if ye Red Skins was treated with such mixture of
Justice	ORGANIZATION	and Authority as they eld understand , but iff he was living now he must see that wee can do naught but fight em & that right heavily .

Weathersfield &	ORGANIZATION	for many yeares after we had moved to
Hadley	PERSON	to live , was ye Wolves .

		Catamounts was bad eno ' & so was ye Beares , but it was ye Wolves yt was ye worst . ''

		The writer artlessly concludes that the '' younge hatred rising in my Bloode '' in later years of Red Skins , catamounts , wolves , and so on , '' is not a Sin because God mayde em to be hated . ''

		In Chapter IV .

		the author turns to the rec - ord of the voyage of the ''
Abigail	PERSON	, '' a slow - sailing craft which followed in the wake of the 44 Mayflower , '' bringing several passengers of distinction , among them the second
John Winthrop	PERSON	.

		With
Winthrop	PERSON	came his wife 's elder sister , Mrs.
Margaret Lake	PERSON	; and it is mainly to the fortunes of Mrs.
Lake	PERSON	and her immediate descendants , the Gallups of
New London County	LOCATION	, that this chapter , headed '' A Pioneer Home in
Connecticut	LOCATION	, '' is devoted .

		In Chapters V. and VI .

		the author turns to the records of the comparatively easy and prosperous life of the honest Dutch burghers of
New Amsterdam	LOCATION	in
1698	DATE	.

		Two notable old houses of
New Amsterdam	LOCATION	are minutely described , on the authority of a witness who had been familiar with them in his youth ; and Chapter VI .

		tells in detail and most entertain - ingly of the '' Cares of the Huysvrow '' a notable person , be it said , who carried on under her own roof-tree a sort of complex plant or manufactory for the making of nearly every - thing needed by the family and its retinue of retainers and colaborers .

		Says Miss Smith : '' When reading , as one occasionally does in our day , of some ' wonderful woman ' who superintends a fac - tory , or carries on some other line of equally active business , we should remember that very likely her grandmother once had as much responsibility , and filled it as well , without having to go beyond the bounds of her own house to do so . ''

		Chapters VII. , VIII. , and IX. , describing the Huguenot settlers in
New Rochelle	LOCATION	, are among the best in the book .

		The writer is plainly touched by the tale of the plaintive fortunes of these exiles , who bore a hard fate with a gayety and a fertility of resource peculiarly their own .

		A letter of
1704	DATE	gives a touching picture of a band of these pious refugees on their way to church in
New York	LOCATION	, twenty miles away for it was twenty years after the coming of the first Huguenot set - tlers to
New Rochelle	LOCATION	, before the colony could spare the money for a church and pastor of its own . ''

		Every week I see the Huguenots pass the house in troops on their way to church in the city .

		As they pass here all have lunch bags or baskets and also their shoes on their arms .

		Yet they are not bare-footed , for they are all provided with wooden shoes , such as the peas - ants wear in
France	LOCATION	and in the Low Countries .

		When they reach a stream not far from the church where they have erected a shed , they all stop and such of them as have other shoes change them before going on ; the others wash their feet and their wooden shoes and put them on again .

		They are all very plainly dressed , but some of them are very elegant looking persons with most charming manners .

		As they pass they are singing some of their psalms , that is , the psalms of
David	PERSON	, translated into the French .

		Some of the airs are very grand and spirit-stirring , but many of them are as sad as dirges , and why should they not be ?

		For surely this people have suffered much .

		Still they are nearly always smiling and happy .

		But to think of walking forty miles in going to and from church every
Lord 's Day 1	DATE	I am afraid my Christianity would never be equal to that . ''

		An outcast from his native land , and not , like most of his neighbors , a voluntary colonist , the Huguenot willingly cut the ties that bound him to the Old World , transferring gratefully to the land of his adoption the inborn and long-tried loyalty of his nature , and ceasing to speak his own language as speedily as pos - sible .

		French names , Christian names and surnames , became in many cases fearfully and wonderfully changed .

		The musical De la Vergne , for instance , was presently written as one word , and pronounced Dillyuarje ; while the elegant and chivalrous
Bonne Passe	PERSON	, after passing through the uncouth forms of Bunpas and
Bumpus	PERSON	, was finally degraded into Bump !

		The children of the Huguenot settlers , it is pleasant to note , were treated with a gentleness and indulgence then hardly known among families of English or even of Dutch descent .

		Innocent sports and amusements were encour - aged , gayety of heart and lightness of deport - ment were fostered , and 44 the graces '' were inculcated through little games , jeux de cour -
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 417 toisie , one of which , called '' La Loi des Bais - ers '' our author pleasantly describes . ''

		In this game only girls were allowed to play .

		One of them stood in the centre of a room , and round her passed a decorous procession of little women , each one of whom bowed and courtesied low before the gracious ' reigning lady , ' kissing her extended hand and chanting ' La main !

		La main ,
Jolie	ORGANIZATION	!

		Petite !

		Pour les amis .

		Pour lea amis . '

		To each the small lady in the centre courtesied with more or less of grace , and responded , the friends in this case being supposed to be of the opposite sex : ' Merci , merci ; mes bons amis . '

		At the next round the ' reigning lady ' presented her brow to be kissed by all in turn , while the chant now ran : ' Le front !

		Le front !

		Le noble front !

		Pour les peres , et les freres . '

		To this the response was a lower courtesy and the words : ' Mon cher papa !

		Mes freres che ` ris . '

		At the third turn of the procession the small lady pre - sented both her hands and her cheeks , while the chanted words were : ' La joue !

		La joue !

		La rougeante joue !

		Pour les douces soeurs , et les meres . '

		In this the kissing was mutual , and on both cheeks , without further words .

		At the fourth round the reign - ing lady ' was seated , demurely placing one small finger on her archly pouting lips , while the others passed by , each with half-averted face and one hand raised as if prohibiting a nearer approach , while chanting : ' La bonche !

		La bouche , si ravissante !

		Pour les maris !

		Mais seulement les maris ! ' ''

		Outwardly less cheerful than his Huguenot co-religionists , the Puritan colonist had , as we know , his seasons of large indulgences in the good things of life witness the following extract from a letter of
1779	DATE	describing a Thanksgiving dinner .

		The arrangements were on a Gargantuan scale . ''

		All the baking of pies and cakes was done at our house & we had the big oven heated and filled twice each day for three days before it was all done , & everything was good , though we did have to do without some things that ought to be used .

		... Of course we could have no Roast Beef .

		None of us have tasted Beef this three years back , as it all must go to the
Army	ORGANIZATION	, & too little they get , poor fellows .

		But , Nay quitty maw 's Hunters were able to get us a fine red Deer , so that we had a good Haunch of Venisson on each table .

		These were balanced by huge
Chines of Roast Pork	ORGANIZATION	at the other ends of the Tables .

		Then there was on one a big
Roast Turkey &	ORGANIZATION	on the other a Goose , & two big
Pigeon Pasties	ORGANIZATION	.

		Then there was an abundance of good Vegetables of all the old sorts & one which I do not believe you have yet seen .

		... It is called Sellery & you eat it without cooking ... Our Mince Pies were good ... The Pumpkin Pies , Apple Tarts & big Indian Puddings lacked for nothing save Appetite by the time we had got round to them .

		There was no Plumb Pudding , but a boiled Suet Pudding , stirred thick with dried Plumbs and Cherries , was called by the old
Name &	ORGANIZATION	answered the purpose .

		... It was extraordinary good . ''

		It remains to be added that the company `` did not rise from the Table '' until after dark -LRB- one wonders how they were able to rise at all -RRB- , and that the sole drawback to the feast was the arrival of the oranges -LRB- brought in saddle-bags -RRB- in a frozen and quite untropi - cal condition . ''

		We soaked the frost out in cold water , '' says the writer , '' but I guess they was n't as good as they should have been . ''

		Probably not .

		But we must now desist from our perhaps too liberal poachings on
Miss Smith	ORGANIZATION	's enter - taining and instructive pages .

		The book is distinctly one that the student of Colonial manners should read , and the publishers have done their best to make it outwardly attrac - tive .

		The frontispiece is a pretty drawing of the Sharon homestead , and the decorations , by Mr.
T. Guernsey Moore	PERSON	, are tasteful and not cumbersome .


E. G. J. HONOBK	PERSON	DB BALZAC .

		* The illustrious writer whose name appears at the head of this article was born in the city of Tours ,
France	LOCATION	, in the year
1799	DATE	, and died at the comparatively early age of fifty-one .

		He belongs to the splendid group of great men who made the beginning and first half of the nineteenth century memorable in a way that only few half-centuries can rival .

		In
Germany	LOCATION	,
Goathe	PERSON	was completing the work which has taken its place with the greatest work done by any man or in any time ; in
England	LOCATION	,
Walter Scott	PERSON	,
Byron	PERSON	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	, and
Coleridge	PERSON	, were giving expression to the new spirit which was transforming the literature of their country ; in his own land , Balzac enjoyed the friendship of Victor Hugo and
George Sand	ORGANIZATION	.

		He was himself one of those great laborers in his chosen field , whose full measure is not taken by the generation that produces them , but whose adequate appre - ciation belongs to later times which can see them aright .

		The family of Balzac was in comfortable circumstances , and in a fair way to do for him whatever was needed for his best development .

		He does not appear to have been a model student at the school to which he was sent , and his clerical preceptors seem to have suc - ceeded but ill with the young boy , for he *

		He had read extensively in the books that pleased him , and showed considerable precocity of mind and heart , since he wrote , at this early age , a `` Treatise on the Will , '' which one of his teachers incon - tinently threw into the fire .

		Balzac , in his novel of ''
Louis Lambert	PERSON	, '' gives a curious exposition of his mental and moral condition at this time .

		Under the judicious care of his mother , his health was restored , and his ambi - tions were greatly stirred by the removal of the family to
Paris	LOCATION	in
1814	DATE	.

		There he listened to the instruction of Guizot ,
Villemain	PERSON	, and Cousin , and the public libraries and book - stalls found in him an ardent visitor and devo - tee .

		He was intended for the law , pursued the necessary studies , and passed the regular examinations .

		At twenty-one he was a singu - larly promising young man , from the ordinary practical point of view .

		His father now wished him to enter upon the real exercise of his pro- fession ; but after much consideration he was allowed the privilege of making a trial of his powers in the way of literature .

		He was ensconced in an attic in
Paris	LOCATION	, given a meagre income , and permitted to go on his way undis - turbed .

		He wrote a tragedy called '' Crom - well , '' which his family , and a certain professor called in to assist at the reading , condemned forthwith .

		He was taken back home ; but the freedom of the life which he had led , and the absence of a favorite sister , who was now
Madame Surville	ORGANIZATION	, made him long for the attic which he had abandoned .

		He shortly left home for good , and definitely undertook the career which gave the world his '' Human Comedy '' and him a place in literary history which has become more and more distinguished with the passage of the years .

		Balzac 's earlier work fell in that period of intense romanticism which swept every writer into its irresistible current .

		The eighteenth century had been an age of reason , an imper - sonal search for truth , social and political .

		With
Rousseau	PERSON	came the reaction , the assertion of individuality in all regions of thought and life .

		Foreign literatures brought their con - tributions to this great stream which bore older structures to apparent ruin in its tumult - uous rush ,
Spain	LOCATION	with her ballads ,
England	LOCATION	with her historical novels ,
Germany	LOCATION	with her heroes of revolt .

		Balzac brought his slender offering of sensational romances .

		They are stories which he was afterwards glad to ignore , and with which even his warmest admirers do not find it necessary to become familiar .

		These were , however , years of growth and develop - ment , and helped to lay the foundations of the real achievements which were to come ; and finally , in the year
1829	DATE	, appeared the `` Chouans , '' which brought him success , and his apprenticeship was fairly over .

		Balzac was on the way to the profound study of man and the society in which he has his being , that gives character and quality to the mature novels , and has in it the elements of a realism fitted to bear remarkable fruit among his suc - cessors .

		He had , during these years , entered upon business enterprises , which appeared to him promising but left him with a burden of debt , heavy and harassing .

		He found his way to many and various friendships with the great of his time .

		His displayed the contradictory characteristics which are not absent from the men of his period and nation .

		He was a good hater as well as lover , desired the possession of wealth , which he made wild attempts to secure by commercial enterprise or specula - tion , became a collector of pictures and curios , traveled extensively , and touched life at all points .

		Near the close of his career he married
Madame Ilanska	PERSON	, with whom he had long been acquainted , and who became known to him through a correspondence which she opened with some inquiries about his book , '' Le Peau de Chagrin . ''

		Romanticist and realist , sensuous and spiritual-minded , dreamer and scientific observer , indefatigable and in - temperate toiler , Balzac truly lived only in the creation of those stories which were separate chapters in the great work which he had planned , and which indeed took all humanity for its province .

		The history of these writings is one of con - stantly increasing vogue and appreciation , not only in his own country but in all lands .

		Translation on translation has made its ap - pearance in English , although the difficulty of a satisfactory rendering might well give the most courageous pause .

		Some twenty years ago ,
Miss Katharine Prescott Wormley	PERSON	made a beginning in this country , and she has found it necessary practically to go through the entire list .

		Other translations have appeared , in En - gland , and now we have the present American edition , with copious introductions under the editorship of Prof.
W. P. Trent	PERSON	of
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	.

		THE DIAL 419 derment ; to-day his is no longer a reputation confided to the fostering care of scholars and eager students of literatures other than their own .

		He has entered into his kingdom , and made captive readers in all lands and climes .

		The opinions about him are in the nature of the case widely different .

		Professor
Dowden	PERSON	says of him : '' There is something gross in
Balzac	LOCATION	's genius ; he has little wit , little deli - cacy , no sense of measure , no fine self-criticism ; ... he piles sentence on sentence , hard and heavy as the accumulated stones of a cairn .

		Did he love his art for its own sake ?

		It must have been so ; but he esteemed it also as an implement of power , as the means of pushing towards fame and grasping gold . ''

		On the other hand ,
Taine	PERSON	places him with
Shakes	PERSON	- peare ; in a recent article Professor
Harry Thurston Peck	PERSON	has said that '' at the last his name will be placed higher still than Shake - speare 's , at the very apex of the pinnacle of fame '' ; and Professor
Trent	PERSON	gives him a posi - tion but little below this .

		Balzac 's literary production , during his brief twenty years of real activity , was most extraor - dinary .

		It is impossible here even to mention his undisputed masterpieces , but such books as `` Le PereGoriot , '' ``
Eugenie Grandet	PERSON	, '' `` Cesar Birotteau , '' '' Le Cousin
Pons	PERSON	, '' '' La Cousine Bette , '' '' La Duchesse de Langeais , '' '' Le Peau de Chagrin , '' '' La Recherche de L'Absolu , '' '' Seraphita , '' '' Le Medicin de Campagne , '' come immediately into one 's consciousness .

		They seem to span the entire field of human life , to penetrate its depths , to ascend its heights , to give a reproduction singularly like the original .

		The characters that people the world which has arisen under this
Prospero	ORGANIZATION	's wand have a reality that is wonderful ; the ex - periences through which they move have a vividness that is as remarkable ; the catas - trophes that ensue through their weaknesses and misadventures , which are seen in full pro- portion and consequence in the strong light that is one of the romancer 's chief gifts , are appalling .

		He has the naturalist 's power of burying himself in the individual whom he is studying ; he analyzes his subjects with an as - surance that leaves nothing undiscovered .

		He has the impartiality which a creator must have ; these men and women grow and move and live ; they are observed with keen accuracy as they plan and act and develop ; they pursue their own ends , and are confronted by the destinies which they have woven for themselves .

		But we come now to the novelist 's great achievement , which , in the Preface to the '' Human Comedy , '' he has announced as his main endeavor , and which Professor Trent calls '' the principal of coordination in fiction . ''

		These personages were to be seen in organic relation with each other , in vital connection with the social environment which so profoundly acted upon them .

		This is a very different affair from the reappearance in a later book of men and women who have had their entrance in an earlier one .

		It is a study of society as a whole , of the evolution of character in the milieu which has so much to do with its formation ; it is a bold anticipation of views and doctrines that have had their authoritative exposition elsewhere and later .

		It is perhaps not out of place here to give a quotation from
Balzac	LOCATION	's preface to his '' Human Comedy '' in which he sums up his intentions : '' It was no small task to depict the two or three thousand conspicuous types of a period ; for this is , in fact , the number presented to us by each generation , and which the Human Comedy ' will require .

		This crowd of actors , of characters , this multitude of lives , need a setting if I may be pardoned the expression , a gallery .

		Hence the very natural division , as already known , into Scenes of Private Life , of Provincial Life , of Parisian , Political ,
Military	ORGANIZATION	, and Country Life .

		* Under these six heads are classified all the studies of manners , which form the history of society at large , of all its fails et gestes , as our ancestors would have said .

		These six classes correspond , indeed , to familiar conceptions .

		Each has its own sense and meaning , and answers to an epoch in the life of man ... My work has its geog - raphy as it has its genealogy and its families , its places and things , its persons and their deeds ; as it has its heraldry , its nobles and its commonalty , its artisans and peasants , its politicians and dandies , its army , in short , a whole world of its own . ''

		What is to be said finally of this immense work ?

		Has the author succeeded in his en - deavor ?

		To have made the effort and conceived the plan are in themselves remarkable achieve - ments .

		To have in his day vigorously placed himself side by side with the famous
Geoffry Saint Hilaire	PERSON	, espoused the cause of evolution , and illustrated it in his stories , is a high thing for any man to have done .

		But are these figures genuine types of human thought and aspiration , universally recognized and recognizable , as Ulysses unquestionably is , as Hamlet and Faust * The '' Human Comedy '' -LRB- an appellation which of course suggests the '' Divine Comedy '' -RRB- ia divided into three main sections , viz. : The `` Studies of Manners '' -LRB- `` Etudes de Mojurs '' -RRB- , the `` Philosophical Studies '' -LRB- `` Etudes Philoso - phiques '' -RRB- , the `` Analytical Studies '' -LRB- `` Etudes Analy - tiques '' -RRB- .

		THE PEACE CONFERENCE AT THE HAGUE .

		* One of the most able and influential of the delegates to the
Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	at the
Hague	LOCATION	, Dr.
Frederick W. Holls	PERSON	, has just published an interesting and valuable history of the proceedings of the
Conference	ORGANIZATION	.

		Twenty - six nations sent delegates and each nation sent as its representatives its ablest diplomats , statesmen , and publicists .

		The questions debated were weighty and momentous .

		A foundation was laid , as never before , for the adjustment of differences between nations by peaceful arbitration ; and in case war came , it was sought to deprive it of some of its horrors and to safeguard the life and property of neu - trals and property not contraband of war upon the high seas .

		The rescript of the Emperor of
Russia	LOCATION	call - ing for the assembling of delegates from all the civilized nations , mentioned especially the limiting of the increase of armies and of the use of new and improved machines for the de - struction of human life .

		It soon became evi - dent , however , from positions taken by various delegates of the larger powers , that nothing could be effected in the direction of disarma - ment the matter which evidently the Em - peror of
Russia	LOCATION	had especially in mind .

		The date for this radical departure has not come .

		The time of the Conference was therefore * THE PEACE CONFERENCE AT THE HAGUE , and its Bear - ings on International Law and Policy .

		devoted mostly to two topics , Arbitration and International Law , and in each of these direc - tions sufficient was accomplished to make the meeting one of the great landmarks in the his - tory of mankind , and one of the events which will make the century illustrious .

		International Arbitration has not heretofore been a judicial proceeding , and the findings of arbitrators have oftentimes carried but little weight .

		The reason is plain .

		The arbitrators were chosen by the disagreeing powers as attor - neys rather than judges .

		Each arbitrator strove to obtain all possible advantages for the nation that he represented .

		Under the method of procedure fixed by the Conference each nation may appoint four of its citizens as permanent judges of the
High Court of Arbitration	ORGANIZATION	, and the appointments will be made from among its most eminent men .

		From these judges the litigant nations will select such number as may be agreed upon to hear and determine the questions at issue .

		This tribunal will be the most

Hague Conference	ORGANIZATION	had in reality been nothing more than '' a miscel - laneous collection of moral precepts and rules of intercourse . ''

		From Grotius to our own time many able writers have expounded it , but in time of war any nation felt itself free to disregard such precepts as seemed to conflict with its own immediate interests .

		By the ac - tion of the Conference the chief principles of International Law have been embodied in a treaty which has since been ratified by and be - tween the twenty-six nations represented , and thus is the most widely approved and binding statute enacted in the history of the world .

		As the author states it , this action is the
Magna Charta of International Law	ORGANIZATION	.

		It will be the starting point for all development and com - mentary hereafter .

		The proceedings of diplomatic conferences are usually secret , but in the readable story as told by Dr.
Holls	PERSON	, the curtain is lifted and many interesting debates are opened to the reader .

		The proceedings were at all times conducted with dignity and decorum as became the gravity of the occasion and of the subjects discussed : subjects having a momentous bear - ing upon the progress and even the life of civilization .

		THE DEVELOPMENT OF ROMAN ART .

		* To be interested in art , if one be neither artist nor critic , is now a deed without a name .

		Those good old words '' connoisseur '' and '' dil - ettante '' are but seldom heard .

		Who could wish to be called either now ?

		They belong to that bygone period when Mr.
Burchell	PERSON	con - demned '' the tame , correct paintings of the Flemish school , '' in favor of '' the erroneous but sublime animations of the Roman pencil , '' and
George Primrose	PERSON	learned how much repu - tation might be gained by praising the works of Pietro Perugino .

		Goethe put the Dilettante out of existence -LRB- or should have -RRB- , and the same fate has befallen the connoisseur .

		Yet there was good in the names , even if no more than this : that one indicated -LRB- vaguely , per - haps , but etymologically -RRB- a person who loved * ROMAN ART .

Franz Wickhoff	PERSON	.

		art , and the other a person who knew about it .

		It would be useful to have that distinction still .

		Artists can attend to themselves ; they need not care what people call them .

		And critics , too , need not be troubled at the names -LRB- and epigrams -RRB- which they receive .

		But the general run of educated men and women , now , have also an interest in art of one kind or an - other .

		Mr.
Marshall	PERSON	, some years ago , spoke of the ordinary person interested in art as the '' observer '' ; but he must have been thinking chiefly of painting , for one can hardly be said to observe music or poetry .

		And even were the name more inclusive , it does not indicate the distinction between those who are content to love beautiful things and art , and those who wish to know about them .

		And that distinction is an interesting one .

		In almost any field of art you will find these two sets .

		You may observe the difference strongly marked by the attitude that people take on what they hear of the art criticism of
Morelli	ORGANIZATION	, or of Mr.
Berenson	PERSON	, who seems to be one of the chief perpetuators of his doc - trines .

		But you will see the difference most strongly in the field of ancient art .

		Read an essay of
Pater	ORGANIZATION	's say that on the Athletic Prizemen and then turn to
Furtwangler	PERSON	's treatment of Polycestus , not precisely the same subject but pretty near it , in the '' Mas - terpieces of Greek Sculpture . ''

		You seem almost in two different worlds .

		Greek art is a wonder field , nowadays , for those who know .

		The person of cultivated taste who liked to look at the Venus of Melos in the
Louvre	LOCATION	, and always felt more pleasantly in going up-stairs on account of the
Winged Victory	ORGANIZATION	, hardly knows what to make of a recent book on
Greek Sculpture	ORGANIZATION	.

		There are so many strange , fragmentary , amorphous figures , all so important , and so few of the Greek statues that one remembers -LRB- most of them , indeed , very late and treated generally with a civil neglect -RRB- , that it seems quite a different world from that we used to hear about .

		It is a different world , without a doubt , and an extraordinarily interesting one , too .

		It does seem a pity , of course , not to be content to love and to appreciate quite genuinely and simply the few remains that one knows of real Greek work , until one gets the true Greek spirit , without all this paraphernalia of comparison between all sorts of mutilated work of later copyists .

		But there is still immense fascination in going over the patient 422 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, work , by which out of the Roman copies the German scholar actually re-creates for you the types of the Greek master , and in appreciating the true artistic feeling required as well as the literary and archseological knowledge .

		There is interest , too , in reading the classic histor - ians , in going over the text of Pliny and seeing how , by careful comparison of passages from authors as well as of examples of artists , there arises before one some conception of the history of art in
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	.

		This is a long introduction to Mrs. Strong 's translation of Dr.
Wickhoff	PERSON	's work on '' Roman Art , '' but it has given the standpoint from which the general reader will regard the work .

		It is a book on the history of art , on a very perplexed period , a book of knowledge and scholarship .

		Yet it will have a sort of fasci - nation even to the art-lover .

		Mrs. Strong is already well known from the English edition of
Furtwangler	PERSON	's '' Masterpieces '' and from the commentary and introduction to the trans - lation of
Pliny	ORGANIZATION	's `` Chapters on the History of Art '' by Miss Lex .


Blake	PERSON	.

		These two works lead , in a way , to this third .

		They , however , were on Greek art .

		This present book is on Roman art , one might almost say it creates Roman art , so far as concerns any independent existence .

		It is an extremely interesting story ; with a good deal conjectural , doubtless , with a good deal disputed , of course .

		Dr.
Wickhoff	PERSON	succeeds in tracing out a Roman development of art from the Greek workmen of the time of Augustus down to the earliest Christian manuscript-painters of the fifth cen - tury .

		An immensely curious book , one would gladly say more of it , although real criticism of such a theory belongs to more special scholars and more technical journals ; a book for those who like to know about art , and yet with its interest for the others too .

		Indeed , one can not follow out the careful appreciation of so many sources -LRB- very fully illustrated , by the way -RRB- of Greek copies and Roman portraits , of bas-reliefs on the Altar of Peace and the
Axle of Titus	ORGANIZATION	, of painting on the walls of
Pompeii	LOCATION	and the few Roman rem - nants , down to that beautiful purple manu - script that gave rise to the whole discussion , one can not follow it all carefully through without feeling that the distinction we have spoken of may be after all an illusion , and that in truth one can not know much about art without a genuine love for it .


EDWARD E. HALE	PERSON	, JR. .

		THE PHILIPPINE QUESTION PER SE .

		* Now that the Philippine question has partly disappeared as a mere factor in partisan war - fare , or at least as a campaign issue , there will doubtless be a more general disposition to consider it on its merits , to arrive at a knowl - edge of the facts , and to reach some rational conclusion as to what is best to do about it .

		After the heat of contest , when '' the shouting and the tumult dies , '' comes the time for reflec - tion and deliberation . ''

		Great captains , with their guns and drums , Disturb our judgment for the hour , But at last silence comes . ''

		And in this silence , with judgments undis - turbed by factional strife and passion , is to be worked out the practical solution of the prob - lems that confront Americans in their new and not altogether happy relations with their so - called '' island possessions . ''

		First of all , it is evident that full knowledge of the facts is essential ; and to this end these recently pub - lished books contribute in no small degree .

		The translation , by Dr.
David J. Doherty	PERSON	, of the brochure of Professor
Ferdinand Blum	PERSON	- entritt is to be welcomed at this time as shed - ding the pure light of scientific investigation on a subject that partisan prejudice has clouded over .


Herr Blumentritt	PERSON	is the professor of ethnology in the scientific school of
Leitmeritz	LOCATION	,
Bohemia	LOCATION	, a member of the
Berlin Society of Ethnology	ORGANIZATION	, and was for years a resident of
the Philippines	LOCATION	, where he was widely known as the intimate friend of the patriot-martyr Rizal during his later life .

		He is therefore pos - sessed of information which is absolutely need - ful to an understanding of the case of the Filipino people .

		The first part of his paper is taken up with ethnological considerations .

		He shows that the coast Malays were already enjoying a civilization of no mean kind when the Spanish discovered the islands .

		Coming just in time to combat the spreading doctrines of Islam , Christianity gradually extended over the greater part of the archipelago , limiting the Moslems to the southern or
Sulu	LOCATION	islands .

		Of these coast Malays who accepted
Christi	LOCATION	- anity , there are several tribes , representing slightly varying ancestral tendencies ; but for * THE PHILIPPINES : THEIR PEOPLE AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS .

		THE DIAL 423 all practical purposes they are a homogeneous people , professing one faith and speaking a common tongue , with common aspirations and no small degree of culture .


Herr Blumentritt	PERSON	calls attention to the fact that a larger per - centage of them are able to read and write than in certain self-governing European coun - tries , notably
Italy	LOCATION	,
Spain	LOCATION	, and some of the eastern States like Rou mania and
Montenegro	LOCATION	and , he might have added , some of the States of the
American Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		This
Chris	PERSON	- tian population is variously estimated , but constitutes an enormous majority of the inhab - itants , probably exceeding six and a half mil - lions and possibly more than eight millions .

		The rest of the people are the Moslems or Moros , with about half a million souls ; the heathen hill tribes , numbering about a million ; and the aborigines or negritos , who do not exceed twenty thousand all told and are rap - idly becoming extinct .

		The pamphlet will be found full of similarly useful information , being particularly valuable in showing the relations borne by the American authorities to the clergy of the religious orders in
the Philippines	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Herbert Welsh	PERSON	, the author of `` The Other Man 's Country , '' has had to do with the North American aborigines through many years without imputation of selfishness or dis - honesty , and has gained no slight knowledge of what Americans call inferior races .

		Thor - oughly aware of the hideous immoralities and criminal blunders that may be found detailed in Mrs.
Helen Hunt Jackson	PERSON	's '' A Century of Dishonor , '' and in various other works , the author here enters a plea for a sense of respon - sibility and an enlightened conscience which will prevent a repetition of these domestic ca - lamities in the international arena .

		More than all , he holds in mind the awful price paid by the
United States	LOCATION	for its enslavement of the African , and hopes by sober counsel to avoid the exaction of a similar penalty for a similar offense against Asiatics .

		The first of the American commissions sent to the
Philippines	LOCATION	made a study , imperfect but convincing , of British influence in the
Malay States	LOCATION	the brightest stars in the crown of
Great Britain	LOCATION	's imperialism and the least imperialistic .

		As a result an earnest recommendation of a civil service similar to that used by
England	LOCATION	in
Malaya	LOCATION	was made to the government of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Unfortunately , there has been little disposition shown to use any of the re - straints of a properly constituted civil service .

		On the contrary , most of the officers in the islands under the American flag , in both hem - ispheres , have been selected from a class of men which the nation holds in profound dis - trust , that of the professional officeholders , political heelers and strikers , the men of `` pull '' and '' inflooence . ''

		Despite the terrible warn - ing of '' carpet-bag '' rule in the South , under conditions which make for added terrors by way of a censored press , vast distance from the centres of national thought , lack of constitu - tional restraints , and differences in race , color , religion , and civilization , the identical policy has been permitted to take root and thrive .

		The regular army alone stands for discipline and such morality as a state of war connotes .

		Mr.
Welsh	PERSON	has done wisely in calling our at - tention at this time to the facts in the case .

		Only by taking note of the errors already made can the American people hope to find wisdom for future guidance in dealing with the most vexatious of questions , and those which our political institutions hinder us , in a peculiar manner , from handling calmly and in - telligently .

		He has done wisely , too , in setting before our eyes the example of Sir
Andrew Clark	PERSON	in the Malayan peninsula ; since the plain alternatives seem to be either an adoption of his most satisfactory methods , the crowning results of
Great Britain	LOCATION	's colonial experiments through several centuries , at once and with thoroughness ; or a treading of the same bar - barous and bloody path by which
Great Britain	ORGANIZATION	such eminence as she now maintains won through another series of grieving centuries .

		Taken in connection with the writings or biog - raphies of those who have demonstrated the advantages of British advice in the far East , it is evident from `` The Other Man 's Country '' that the American authorities have disregarded every lesson taught by English colonization and administration among peoples of another language , including those to be gleaned from the war in
South Africa	LOCATION	.

		An examination into Russian methods would show that a study of these has been equally neglected .

		Yet Rus - sia possesses an ideal government for adminis - tration among alien peoples , by reason of a fixed and centralized policy , far above the will of a fickle democracy , republic , or constitutional monarchy dependent upon the suffrages of an intelligent and mutable population .

		Mr.
Everett Guy Ballard	PERSON	performs a service not unlike that of Mr.
Welsh	PERSON	, in his '' Liberty , Independence , and Self-Government , '' a pam - phlet sufficiently described by its sub-title as 424 THE DIAL -LSB-

		HOLIDAY PUBLICATIONS .

		i.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	's monumental life of Prince
Charles Edward	PERSON	-LRB- Scribner -RRB- is an important and carefully wrought work in historical biography which de - serves fuller and more critical treatment than can be accorded it here .

		The rich and elaborate setting bestowed upon it by the publishers has , however , tempted us to call attention to it under the category of Holiday publications , and in this class it , in point of sumptuousness , easily heads the season 's list .

		The volume is a truly splendid one a princely literary and pictorial memorial of a lost cause , which many a Jacobite of the old type -LRB- and we be - lieve there are still a few fantastic survivals of it -RRB- might have consented to beggar himself to possess .

		We do not mean to ascribe to Mr.
Lang	PERSON	who has written with the greatest fairness and impar - tiality , though a Scot and a '' romantic '' any undue degree of bias in favor of the cause or the personality of the gallant and picturesque , though relatively not altogether worthy , adventurer who set
Britain	LOCATION	ablaze in '' Forty Five , '' and whose memory was cherished long after in hearts far nobler and purer than his own .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	began his task , as we infer , with a certain romantic pre - dilection for his hero ; but as his researches pro- gressed he was fain to admit that the Jacobite idol was not all that the perfervid Jacobite fancy painted him that he was , though in many respects an amiable and well-meaning young man , not at all the '' very perfect gentle knight '' of song and story . ''

		His figure , '' says Mr.
Lang	PERSON	, '' is beheld in a lustre not its own : in the splendor of the love and loyalty that gave themselves ungrudgingly for him and for his cause , that cherished his memory , and even now hold it a kind of treason to tell the truth as far as the truth can be known . ''

		Having written thus in the spirit of the historian , and having endeavored to walk in the light of the records alone , it is not to be wondered at that Mr.
Lang	PERSON	finds cause to complain that he is '' censured as a Jacobite and a Whig . ''

		Having no prejudices of our own either way , we are inclined to believe that Mr.
Lang	PERSON	has painted a true portrait , and one that will remain for all time the standard presentment of the man Prince
Charles Edward	PERSON	.

		His book is based mainly on the
Stuart Papers	ORGANIZATION	at
Windsor	LOCATION	Castle ; but no original and trustworthy source of information has been left unexplored . ''

		In printed books , '' be says , '' I have read , I think , most that has been pub - lished . ''

		Let us add that Mr.
Lang	PERSON	has told this fascinating story in a pure , flexible , steadily flowing , and limpid style that is so good that the reader is not conscious , except upon reflection , how very good it is .

		The chronicler 's veracity joined to the narrator 's art is an ideal difficult of attainment ; yet Mr.
Lang	PERSON	approaches it nearly .

		The book is the best , and should prove the most enduring , thing he has done .

		The volume has received every embel - lishment of the book-maker 's and the engraver 's art .

		The frontispiece , a beautifully colored plate , and quite the finest piece of color-printing that we remember to have seen , is a portrait of the Prince , after
Largilliere	ORGANIZATION	's painting in the
National Portrait Gallery	ORGANIZATION	.

		This noble plate serves as an earnest of a wealth of portraits and other illustrations which must be examined to be appreciated .

		Among the subjects are Prince
James Francis Stuart	PERSON	, Princes Sobieska , Prince
Henry Stuart	PERSON	,
Marquis D'Argen	PERSON	- son ,
Lord Elcho	PERSON	,
Jenny Cameron	PERSON	of
Lochiel	LOCATION	, the
Duke of Cumberland	ORGANIZATION	,
Keith	PERSON	the
Earl Marischal	PERSON	,
Flora Macdonald	PERSON	-LRB- 2 -RRB- , and the Duchess of
Albany	LOCATION	.


Hogarth	PERSON	's famous plates , '' Lord Lovat Counting the Clans , '' and the '' March to Finchley , '' are handsomely reproduced .

		But we must refer the reader to the volume itself for a further view of its attractions .

		We are glad to note that the beautiful volume on '' Famous Homes of
Great Britain	LOCATION	, '' which we had occasion to praise last season , met with a success that warrants the issue this year of a kindred and companion volume entitled '' More Famous Homes of
Great Britain	LOCATION	, and Their Stories '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , also edited by Mr.
A. H. Malan	PERSON	.

		In
England	LOCATION	, with the wealthier class , the town-house has always been a rather unimportant accessory a sort of tem - porary shelter or convenience for use during '' the season , '' while the country-house has been the real inalienable home and abiding-place , the centre of family treasures and traditions , the storied cradle of the race .

		The English ancestral country home is invested with the dignity ` of a national institution , which finds but a faint and imperfect counterpart in other countries .

		The present volume describes in sufficient detail the beauties and treasures of a dozen of the more noteworthy country seats of En - gland and
Scotland	LOCATION	, the articles being in many instances from the pens of the respective owners of the places described .

		The volume is richly illus - trated with photographic plates , showing the seats described and their surroundings , historic rooms ,
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 425 art treasures , family portraits , choice architectural details , etc. .

		The book forms as good a substitute as can be got for a sight-seeing jaunt to these cynosural spots of rural
England	LOCATION	.

		Messrs.
Little	PERSON	,
Brown , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish a new and elaborate two-volume edition of
Helen Hunt Jack	PERSON	- son 's popular ''
Ramona	PERSON	, '' that tender and romantic picture of old-Californian life which American read - ers should know and cherish as one of the few dis - tinctively native novels in which a degree of real imaginative power is shown .

		Though over sixteen years have elapsed since the death of Mrs.
Jackson	PERSON	, little is generally known of her life , and therefore the publishers of the present edition have done well in prefixing to it a biographical sketch of the author from the sympathetic pen of Miss
Susan Coolidge	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Henry Sandham	PERSON	, the illustrator , furnishes a note in which he tells how his original sketches for '' Ramona '' were made .

		The volumes are tastefully bound , and contain all of Mr.
Sand	PERSON	- ham 's admirable illustrations , reproduced in photo - gravure .

		A clean-cut and trenchant style , and the frequent marks of real nicety of perception and of the habit of looking somewhat below the surface of things , lend to Mr.
Richard Whiteing	PERSON	's ''
Paris	LOCATION	of To-Day '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- a certain distinction among books of its generally ephemeral class .

		Mr.
Whiteing	PERSON	is at once artist and analyst ; and one can not glance through his pages , however casually , without feel - ing that , for all their glow of color and hurly-burly of movement , they are the work of a man who has seriously tried to understand the men and manners he paints .

		Mr.
Whiteing	PERSON	's book , furthermore , is a good deal more than the record of the impressions of an intelligent and thoughtful visitor to the French capital , inasmuch as it is freighted with the general observations of the student on topics of art , literature , and politics , and is thus in no small measure a work of criticism , and a delightful one in its kind ; and of this the reader may easily con - vince himself by turning to the chapters on '' The Governmental Machine '' and '' Artistic
Paris	LOCATION	. ''

		So good a book deserves an inviting setting , and a somewhat sumptuous one has been accorded it by the publishers .

		The volume is an ample octavo -LRB- 10 x 7 inches -RRB- of 250 pages , bound in dark-blue cloth richly stamped with the municipal arms in red , white , and gold .

		The graphic force of Mr.
Whiteing	PERSON	's vivid descriptions is enhanced by the numerous drawings of Andre ''
Castaigne	PERSON	, whose merits as an illustrator need not now be pointed out .

		All in all , the book , pictorially and otherwise , is the best one on
Paris	LOCATION	, contemporary
Paris	LOCATION	, that we remember to have seen for a decade .

		The ''
Gibson	PERSON	girl '' is copiously and attractively represented this year in Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	's `` Americans '' -LRB-
R. H. Russell	PERSON	-RRB- , but not to the total exclusion of other types of Gibsonized natives .

		We say '' Gibsonized '' because , while Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	to a considerable degree holds up the mirror to nature in his pictures , there is nevertheless generally in them a pretty marked personal equation to be eliminated if we are to get at the strict truth as told by the solar pencil , for instance .

		Of course , since Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	devotes himself to drawing '' types '' he must gen - eralize ; but there is danger in cultivating a man - nerism which tends to fix and stereotype itself in the end .

		The present volume is the fifth in the familiar series of Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	's published drawings , and is as clever in execution and as entertaining in theme as its popular predecessors .

		It contains eighty-four cartoons .

		To praise the ''
Temple	ORGANIZATION	'' editions of standard authors is now almost superfluous .

		These choice little volumes are , as everybody knows , gems of dainty and artistic book-manufacture .

		To the series is now added the K
Temple Dickens	ORGANIZATION	, '' in which the publishers -LRB- Messrs. Dent in
London	LOCATION	and
Doubleday	PERSON	-
McClure Co.	ORGANIZATION	in the
United States	LOCATION	-RRB- have added cer - tain special features which make the set rather sur - pass its predecessors in attractiveness .

		Each of the forty volumes contains , for example , a daintily colored frontispiece , from original drawings by various artists .

		The bindings are of flexible dark - green lambskin , prepared by a special process ; and they do not , we are glad to note , `` curl up '' in the exasperating way which usually makes the soft cover a nuisance .

		This special edition is limited to a thousand numbered copies , and these are the first impressions from absolutely new plates .

		The happy owner of a set of the ''
Temple Dickens	ORGANIZATION	'' is to be congratulated on possessing what , in the not distant future , will in all likelihood be rated among the objects of bibliophilistic longing , not to say envy .

		In his scholarly and severely critical study of '' Fra Angelico '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr.
Langton Doug	PERSON	- las gives our commonly cherished preconception of
Fra Angelico	LOCATION	as the mere mystical painter of dreams and visions a somewhat rude but perhaps salutary shock .

		Relying strictly upon evidence furnished by the artist 's paintings and drawings , Mr.
Douglas	PERSON	labors with much erudition and con - siderable success to show that
Fra Angelico	LOCATION	was not only the saint and the rapt dreamer of poetico - religious dreams , but the humanist and scholar , the student of the antique , and the ardent cultivator of the dry technique , the handicraftmanship , of his art . ''

		In him , '' says Mr.
Douglas	PERSON	, '' the artist and the saint , the devout Catholic and the man of the Renaissance , were in perfect harmony . ''

		Mr.
Douglas	PERSON	's handling of his theme is fresh and scholarly , and his book may be commended without stint to the student desiring to examine the purely artistic side of
Fra Angelico	LOCATION	's art , and to detect the traces of learning , archaeological and other , that unquestionably lurk therein .

		The 1 volume is care - fully prepared , and contains much in the way of reference and bibliography for which the studious reader will be thankful .

		Print , paper , etc. , are unexceptionable , and the long list of beautiful illustrations enriches a work that forms one of the choicer gift-books of the season .

		426 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, llossettians will thank Miss
Elisabeth Luther Gary	PERSON	for her monograph on '' The
Uossettia	LOCATION	,
Dante Gabriel	PERSON	andChristina '' -LRB- Patnam -RRB- , withits photograv - ure reproductions of the characteristic examples of
Rossetti	PERSON	's work which form the priceless collection of Mr.
Samuel Bancroft	PERSON	, Jr. , of
Wilmington	LOCATION	,
Dela	LOCATION	- ware .

		In Mr.
Bancroft	PERSON	's house hang the '' Lady Lilith , '' the `` Found , '' the '' Magdalen , '' the '' Water Willow , '' the ''
Ruth Herbert	PERSON	'' study in gold and umber , the portrait in colored chalks of Mr.
F. R. Leyland	PERSON	, and an early study of still-life a collec - tion exemplifying every period and style of Ros - setti 's art .

		The present volume contains repro - ductions of all these works save the last two , together with one drawn by
Frederick Shields	PERSON	of
Rossetti	PERSON	after death , a sketch also in Mr.
Bancroft	PERSON	's collection .

		While it is these pictures that lend to Miss
Gary	PERSON	's book its peculiar charm and value , her well-balanced study of
Dante Gabriel	ORGANIZATION	bears the impress of sanity of view and cool discrimination , and serves to correct and modify current distorted impressions of this somewhat fantastic and not altogether amiable genius .

		Of critical value also are
Miss Gary	ORGANIZATION	's two chapters on
Christina Rossetti	PERSON	.

		On the whole , the work is a sound and scholarly production , and one not devoid of literary charm .

		The volume is handsomely made , and of marked attractiveness pictorially .

		Mr.
Charles E. Brock	PERSON	's capital and copious drawings form a sufficient pretext for the reissue of Mrs.
Kate Douglas Wiggin	PERSON	's two entertaining books entitled ''
Penelope	PERSON	's English Experiences '' and ``
Penelope	PERSON	's Progress '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		Each volume contains fifty odd pictures which duly reflect the vivacious humor of the text .

		Of narratives of the foreign experiences of the American female tourist , we have had not a few of late ; but we do not recall any of these that for refined humor , sting - less and therefore agreeable satire , and general charm of style , are worthy to be compared with these popular stories -LRB- for such they are in form -RRB- of Mrs.
Wiggins	PERSON	.

		They may be read to the best advantage , or re-read with an added zest , in this pictorial Holiday edition , in which the two volumes are boxed together as a set .

		Messrs.
Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	' extra Holiday edition , in two volumes , of Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	's new novel , ''
Eleanor	PERSON	, '' is at once elegant and in - expensive , and makes a strong bid for popularity with the Christmas book-buyer .

		The Italian set - ting of the story and the outward grace and charm of its leading actors offer a tempting field for the illustrator , and Mr.
Albert Sterner	PERSON	has exploited it acceptably in his fourteen full page plates which form the pictorial feature of the edition .

		Mr.
Sterner	PERSON	draws well , and he has evidently taken pains to come at a definite conception of the people so delightfully limned by his author before put - ting his own pencil to paper .

		The result is a har - mony between text and pictures which is most grateful to the reader .

		Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's book is per - haps the most important of the season 's novels , and is entitled to much fuller and more critical treatment than can be accorded it in the present article .

		Our necessarily somewhat hurried pre - liminary inspection of it has left us with the im - pression that it is more the result of a purely artistic aim than anything Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	has yet given us .

		The book is one which readers of current literature must not leave unread , and it may be read to the best advantage in this notably enticing Holiday edition .

		Much breath is wasted in debates over the origin and authorship of older popular and national songs , by disputants with whom race sentiment and loy - alty to a name take the place of evidence to the fact .

		There has long been need of an authority to turn to for a rational settlement of such contro - versies ; and the two comely duodecimo volumes now before us , '' Stories of Famous Songs '' -LRB- Lip - pincott -RRB- , seem to go a considerable way toward supplying it .

		Mr.
S. J. Adair Fitz-Gerald	PERSON	, the editor of the work , has spent some fifteen years in the agreeable task of running to earth , so to speak , such famous songs as are of doubtful origin , and in gathering facts and reminiscences about such songs as were written under romantic , pathetic , or enter - taining circumstances .

		Every available source biographies , histories , reviews , old MSS. , etc. .

		has been ransacked for evidence ; and the result is a work that is decidedly entertaining , and , we should think , trustworthy .

		Almost all the favorite songs whose story is at all worth retelling figure more or less conspicuously in Mr.
Fitz Gerald	PERSON	's bright and readable work .

		The volumes are given a tasteful Holiday dress , and contain several suit - able illustrations in photogravure and half-tone .

		Of that always refined and graceful illustrator , Mr.
Will H. Low	PERSON	, it may fairly be said that he touches nothing that he does not adorn and beautify .

		Mr.
Low	PERSON	's pencil is charmingly in evidence this year in Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's edition of '' As You Like It '' one of the half-dozen most artistic and alluring of the season 's publications .

		Mr.
Low	PERSON	's drawings are a joy to the eye , and really enhance one 's enjoyment of the text : and how often one is compelled to say the reverse where the illustrators of Shakespeare are in question !

		Print , paper , and binding are of flawless quality , and the semi-illustrative marginal decoration or border in red is pleasing and does not overload the page .

		The
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	bring out in lavishly - illustrated Holiday form Mrs.
Alice Morse Earle	PERSON	's capital book on '' Stage-Coach and Tavern Days . ''

		The author is thoroughly at home in dealing with the picturesque days of primitive travel , and her delightful pages form as vivid a presentment of the subject as anybody is likely to ask for .

		The illus - trations are profuse and well-executed , giving just the aid needed to a thorough appreciation and enjoyment of the text .

		There are pictures of old inns , old coaches , old sign-boards , old tap-rooms , old turn-pikes , toll-gates , sleighs , milestones , all sorts of odds and ends of tavern furnishings and
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 427 tap-room utensils pitchers , punch-bowls , ladles , platters , flip-glasses , toddy-sticks , nutmeg-holders , and what not , together with some interesting cuts after contemporary prints that mirror faithfully the ways and woes and comforts and hardships of the traveller in what some of us are pleased to call `` the good old times . ''

		Those who wish to trans - port themselves in fancy to the phase of them in question can not do better than procure a copy of the beautiful pictorial edition of Mrs.
Earle	PERSON	's scholarly work .

		The buckram cover shows a quaint design , in red and green , stamped in the centre with a cut of an old inn sign .

		Admirers of ''
David Harum	PERSON	, '' and their name is legion , will be glad to know that the Messrs.
Appleton	PERSON	have issued a well-made pictorial edition of the book , a copy of which will answer nicely for a Holiday gift .

		The drawings are mainly by Mr.
B. West Clinedinst	PERSON	, a very capable illustrator , we need hardly say , who has thoroughly grasped the humor of Mr.
Westcott	PERSON	's quaint hero .

		A desirable feature of the new edition is an Introduction , by Mr.
Forbes Heermans	PERSON	, embodying a sketch of Mr.
Westcott	PERSON	, of whom , also , a portrait is supplied .

		The illustrations consist of nine full-page plates and a generous sprinkling of text cuts , part of which are to be credited to Mr.
C. D. Farrand	PERSON	.

		The pictures serve to enhance the graphic quality of the text -LRB- if that were needed -RRB- and are enjoyable in them - selves . ''

		Diedrich Knickerbocker 's '' ever delectable '' History of
New York	LOCATION	'' is issued in novel form from the press of Mr.
R. H. Russell	PERSON	.

		The volume is a substantial buckram-backed folio , of ample size , yet alluring to the fancy of the reader who wants to read comfortably and at his leisure in short , to the reader looking forward to that perhaps most satisfactory and durable of earthly enjoyments , a winter 's evening at the home fireside with an agree - able book as a companion .

		The touch of archaism -LRB- too strong a word here , perhaps -RRB- in the make-up of the volume in no wise detracts from its inviting appearance .

		The pictorial feature is eight full-page drawings of rich humor and good technical quality , which fully attest that the artist , Mr.
Maxfield Parrish	PERSON	, knows his Knickerbocker as a New Yorker should .

		Mr.
Parrish	PERSON	's Dutchmen are irresistible , and we wish Irving might have seen them .

		The player has advanced in repute -LRB- and we fancy in behavior -RRB- since the day when pious Bishop Grin - dal called the Thespians an `` idle sort of people , which have been infamous to all good common - wealths . '' ''

		Society '' has opened its doors to him , and books unnumbered are written in his honor .

		We have now before us a brace of rather sumptu - ous volumes , entitled severally '' Twelve Great Actors '' and '' Twelve Great Actresses '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , wherein Mr.
Edward Robins	PERSON	sketches briefly and entertainingly , and with the gusto of a confirmed `` first-nighter , '' the stage careers of such notable players -LRB- most of them stars now passed from the playhouse firmament -RRB- as
Garrick	PERSON	,
Macready	PERSON	,
Kean	PERSON	, the Booths ,
Sothern	PERSON	,
Wallack	PERSON	, the
Woffington	LOCATION	, the
Bracegirdle	LOCATION	,
Rachel	PERSON	,
Miss Cushman	LOCATION	,
Miss Neilson	PERSON	,
Ristori	PERSON	, and so on .

		Mr.
Robins	PERSON	's books are read - able , full of piquant anecdote , and chatty as books about the stage should be ; and the publishers have issued them in tempting form , with liberal illustra - tions .

		Lovers of books about the stage should not over - look , while on their Christmas-gift-hunting peri - grinations this season , the two natty little volumes presented by the
F. A. Stokes Co.	ORGANIZATION	, containing sketches of Mr.
John Drew	PERSON	and Miss
Ellen Terry	PERSON	, the first named production by Mr.
Edward A. Dithmar	PERSON	, the second by Mr.
Clement Scott	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Dithmar	PERSON	's book , in particular , strikes us as a rather superior bit of work in its way capital as a bio - graphical study and critical in tone .

		Mr.
Clement Scott	PERSON	is well , what he always is ; that is to say , the entertaining purveyor of stage chat and more or less sentimental reminiscences of his own earlier play-going days .

		He tells us , in the present vol - ume , a good deal about Miss
Terry	PERSON	-LRB- whose adorer he has been since he first saw her away back in the ties -RRB- ; and he also tells us a good deal , more suo , about Mr.
Scott	PERSON	.

		The volumes are neatly bound and finely printed , and each contains a generous array of photographic plates showing its hero , or heroine , in favorite parts .

		Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	's '' Little Tour in
France	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- makes its welcome reappearance rein - forced at last by the belated drawings of Mr.
Joseph Pen	PERSON	n ell , without which , for some reason not ex - plained , it was originally issued .

		Says Mr.
James	PERSON	, in his new Preface : '' The little book thus goes forth finally as the picture-book it was intended to be . ''

		We need not again praise , nor characterize in detail , these pleasant travel-papers , which have so easily won their way without pictorial aid ; but , of course , in buying the book , a copy with Mr.
Pennell	PERSON	's lovely drawings is the one to choose .

		The binding shows a bold and suggestive cover-design , and the volume throughout is a model of neatness .

		But we should prefer a type of somewhat stronger face , the print striking us as a little pale and indistinct .

		Mr.
Paul Leicester Ford	PERSON	's sentimental tale , Wanted , A Match-Maker '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , has its improbabilities of a psychological sort , and a cynical critic might carp at its '' situations . ''

		But it is touching enough and interesting enough as one reads it .

		In it , a daughter of
New York	LOCATION	's Four Hundred -LRB- aristocratic and ornamental , but with a heart -RRB- is brought into collision with a hospital doc - tor -LRB- useful and durable , but plebeian , -RRB- through an accident to a newsboy -LRB- pathetic , but preternaturally '' slangy , '' -RRB- who has been providentially run over -LRB- Cor .

		Fifth Ave. and 42d St. -RRB- by the daughter of the
F. H.	PERSON	's brougham , and who turns out , of course , to be the Match-Maker wanted .

		The book has been beautifully gotten up by the publishers , and is , indeed , in point of decorations -LRB- mainly fanciful marginal borders in light-green and black -RRB- , which 428 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, are by Miss
Margaret Armstrong	PERSON	, one of the marked artistic successes of the season .

		There are also five full-plate illustrations by Mr.
Howard Chandler Christy	PERSON	, who has done well from the art - istic point of view , but has , we think , erred as an illustrator in portraying the plain and serviceable doctor as an immaculate '' swell '' of the
Gibson	PERSON	variety which is -LRB- according to Mr.
Ford	PERSON	, who ought to know , -RRB- precisely what he was not .

		But otherwise Mr.
Christy	PERSON	's pictures are charming notably the one facing page 62 , which is really a gem in its way .

		The cover-design is particularly good in pattern and color , and should tempt many a one to open and inspect this pretty book .

		Those twin old-time favorites ,
Dickens	PERSON	's '' Christ - mas Carol '' and '' The Cricket on the Hearth , '' which have brightened so many a Christmastide and taught so many the human value and signifi - cance of Christmas cheer , come to us this year from Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons , in dainty dress bright with the green and red of holly , and enriched with many sympathetic and appreciative drawings by Mr.
Frederick Simpson Coburn	PERSON	, who has done artistic and imaginative justice to those old favor - ites ,
Scrooge	LOCATION	,
Bob Cratchit	PERSON	,
Tiny Tim	ORGANIZATION	,
John Peery	PERSON	- bingle ,
Tackleton	LOCATION	,
Caleb Plummer	PERSON	, and the rest .

		The little volumes are irreproachable in make-up , and we have nothing but praise for Mr.
Coburn	PERSON	's delightful pictures , which lend quite an air of new - ness to these treasured old friends .

		`` The Lover 's Library '' -LRB-
John Lane	PERSON	-RRB- is a series , now current , of tiny volumes in which it is meant to include all that the great British poets have written about love , together with an occasional volume of prose on the same interesting subject , or one of modern verse which may be deemed worthy of in - clusion .

		We have now before us three volumes of the series ,
Browning	PERSON	's '' Love Poems '' and
Shelley	PERSON	's , and
Edmond Holmes	PERSON	's '' The Silence of Love '' a dainty trio of pocketable booklets which any discriminating lover might be glad to possess .

		Their advantages as gift-books from a lover to the object of his '' attentions '' are too ob - vious to be stated , and they certainly seem expressly got up for this purpose , with their general material suggestion of a bunch of
Spring	LOCATION	violets -LRB- floriated marginal designs in violet color , green lettering , and so on -RRB- .

		The editor 's name is not given , but we presume a correct text has been aimed at .

		In the exquisite settings of the brace of little companion volumes entitled '' Among the
Great Masters	ORGANIZATION	in Music '' and `` Among the Great Masters in Literature , '' both by Mr.
Walter Rowlands	PERSON	,
Messrs. Dana Estes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have fairly distinguished themselves .

		In the volume first-named Mr.
Row	PERSON	- lands tells entertainingly of scenes in the lives of
St. Cecilia	LOCATION	,
Lulli	LOCATION	, Stradivarius ,
Bach	PERSON	,
Mozart	PERSON	,
Linley	PERSON	,
Haydn	ORGANIZATION	,
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	, Rouget de
Lisle	LOCATION	,
Paganini	ORGANIZATION	,
Chopin	ORGANIZATION	,
Wagner	PERSON	,
Liszt	ORGANIZATION	, and others ; in the second a like treatment is accorded Homer ,
Sappho , Dante	ORGANIZATION	,
Tasso	LOCATION	,
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Walton	LOCATION	,
Pope	LOCATION	,
Sterne	PERSON	,
Johnson	PERSON	,
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	,
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	,
Schiller	PERSON	,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, etc. .

		The text is intelligently written , and forms largely a running commentary on the illustrations , of which there are thirty-two to the volume a very liberal allotment , it must be admitted .

		These little books are flawlessly made , and should easily make their way .

		Mr.
Clifton Johnson	PERSON	, who will be pleasantly re - called by many as the author and illustrator of a pretty book of last season entitled '' Among English Hedgerows , '' now puts forth a similar and equally attractive volume , recounting through text and pic - tures his experiences as a not unsentimental stroller `` Along French Byways '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The illus - trations , of which there are many , are mainly from photographs taken en route by
Mr Johnson	PERSON	, who is an expert with the camera .

		They represent a va - riety of passing scenes and incidents illustrative of French rural and village life , and form a pleasant running accompaniment to the text , in which the author tells in a chatty and informal way the story of his rambles .

		The book is attractively bound , and forms a suitable shelf-companion for its pop - ular predecessor .

		The late
James T. Fields	PERSON	's `` Yesterdays with Authors '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a charming book which needs no introduction to our readers , makes its reappearance in Holiday dress , with a noble array of portraits and some letters in facsimile heretofore unpublished .

		The binding shows an elaborate de - sign in green and gold , and altogether the volume is one of the most suitable in our list as a gift to a friend of literary tastes .

		A chaste edition of
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's '' In Memoriam , '' of elegant yet severely simple make , and distin - guished in particular by a typography that is a veritable joy to the sense , is published by the
Bankside Press	ORGANIZATION	of
London	LOCATION	, and sold in
America	LOCATION	by
M. F. Mansfield	PERSON	of
New York	LOCATION	.

		The page em - bellishments are confined to the rubricated initials , from the excellent designs of Miss
Blanche McManus	PERSON	; and the binding is of cream-white buckram of medium weave , delicately stamped in gilt , with title , date , and allegorical sketch in con - ventionalized outline .

		The material throughout is of high quality , and , for our part , we are inclined to pronounce the volume an ideal one for the real lover of this noble poem . ''

		Literary Hearthstones , '' the collective title of
Marion Harland	PERSON	's deservedly popular series of bio - graphical studies -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , seems a trifle far - fetched when we examine the volumes to discover the special characteristic it is meant to suggest .

		Perhaps in the two numbers of the series now before us , on
John Knox	PERSON	and
Hannah More	PERSON	, and especially in the first named of them , Mrs.
Terhune	PERSON	has perforce drifted away from the special treat - ment of her themes which she proposed to her - self at the outstart .

		At all events , her sketch of
Knox	ORGANIZATION	is a good biographical study of the usual type , outlining the career of its hero without special effort to set before us the domestic or '' home fire - side '' phase of it .

		In Hannah More , Mrs.
Terhune	PERSON	1900 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 429 has found a theme well suited to her pen , which runs on with cheery feminine vivacity in a field so well strewn with anecdote and chat about interest - ing people .

		Mrs.
Terhune	PERSON	, it may be added , has not been content with merely skimming the cream from the older narratives an easy process and a royal road to readability .

		Her studies evince research and reflection ; and there is always the suggestion of a certain individuality of view .

		The volumes -LRB- boxed in sets of two -RRB- are fully illustrated , and rank among the most tempting and desirable of the Holiday publications of the less ephemeral sort .

		Mr.
Howard Pyle	PERSON	's clever and imaginative draw - ings add an element of strength to the comely vol - ume containing Mr.
Markham	PERSON	's '' The Man with the Hoe , and Other Poems '' -LRB-
Doubleday & McClure Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Mr.
Pyle	PERSON	's frontispiece is a notably fine bit of pictorial allegory from the artistic point of view albeit the American farmer , at least , will hardly thank Mr.
Pyle	PERSON	for the unflattering intima - tions therein contained .

		Besides Mr.
Pyle	PERSON	's frontis - piece , the volume contains a reproduction of the painting by Millet which inspired Mr.
Markham	PERSON	's somewhat doleful production .

		Mr.
Pyle	PERSON	's head and tail pieces are cleverly done and duly sug - gestive .

		, For those who have not yet read , and for those who want to re-read ,
Parkman	PERSON	's ever-delightful ''
Oregon Trail	ORGANIZATION	, '' a copy of Messrs.
Little	PERSON	,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	's edition of it , with Mr.
Frederic Remington	PERSON	's drawings , is decidedly the book to get .

		Mr.
Reming	PERSON	- ton is of course the ideal illustrator for
Parkman	ORGANIZATION	's classic work .

		He knows the
Far West	LOCATION	as it was when his author journeyed through it in the later forties ; and the text , graphic and picturesque as it is , finds a powerful help in these spirited draw - ings , whose merit lies mainly in the fact that they are strictly and literally true .

		There are seventy - five of them , including numerous full-page plates .

		A comely volume bearing the irresistible title '' The Wedding Day in Literature and Art '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- binds together in one delectable gar - land '' the best descriptions of weddings from the works of the world 's leading novelists and poets , '' together with reproductions of famous paintings of incidents of the nuptial day .

		The young man who has '' serious intentions '' need surely look no far - ther than this book for an acceptable gift for the object of them , and for a delicate preliminary inti - mation that he has arrived at the state of mind so tersely described by Mr.
Barkis	PERSON	.

		The compiler of the book , Mr.
C. F. Carter	PERSON	, is clearly a man of charitable mind ; for he states that his work has been done partly '' in order that those who can not or will not marry may at least contemplate the conjugal felicity of others from as many points of view as possible . ''

		This is kind , and attests more - over Mr.
Carter	PERSON	's faith in that sweetness of temper and capacity for contemplating ungrudgingly the bliss of others for which old bachelors are justly famous the world over .

		The authors named in Mr.
Carter	PERSON	's table of contents are too numerous to be even exemplified here ; but why was the wedding of Mr.
Pip	PERSON	's legal friend Mr.
Wemmick	PERSON	-LRB- surely one of the most unique events of the kind in literature -RRB- omitted ?

		The pictures are well chosen and well reproduced , and the volume , with its notably grace - ful cover-design , should make a strong bid for pop - ular favor .

		Four of the '' Pre-Raphaelite Ballads '' of
William Morris	PERSON	have been selected for decorative treatment by Mr.
H. M. O'Kane	PERSON	, and the resulting publica - tion , which bears the imprint of the
A. Wessels Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is a small volume so charming that we linger over its pages with unalloyed satisfaction .

		The illus - trative material consists of borders , full-page draw - ings , and rubricated initials , all in keeping with the Kelmscott type and the old-world feeling of the text .

		The book is in boards with a linen back , and the edition is limited .

		A most engaging and prettily made little volume of diversified literary chat is Dr.
Theodore F. Wolfe	PERSON	's `` Literary Rambles at Home and Abroad '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The book is complete in itself , but the author nevertheless wishes it to be appraised in connection with the preceding volumes to which it is related .

		Dr.
Wolfe	PERSON	has derived the material for the present volume from sojourns in the places described , and from conversations or corre - spondence with the authors mentioned or their surviving friends .

		In his opening chapters Dr.
Wolfe	PERSON	chats pleasantly of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	,
Audubon	LOCATION	,
Irving	LOCATION	,
Willis	PERSON	, Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	,
Stephen Crane	PERSON	, Mr.
Stockton	PERSON	,
Walt Whitman	PERSON	,
Cooper	PERSON	, and others ; then , passing over sea , he reviews the memories and associations that enwrap
Stratford-on-Avon	LOCATION	,
Harrow	LOCATION	, the Ayr - shire
Burnsland	LOCATION	, and the Lake Country ; The pages on
Byron	PERSON	are unusually interesting .

		The volume is charmingly illustrated , and is one of the best and daintiest of the Christmas books .

		That fine perennial , ''
Lorna Doone	PERSON	, '' blooms again with new outward attractions as regularly as the
Holiday	ORGANIZATION	season rolls round .

		Those who have not yet read this strong novel will do well to procure a copy of Harpers ' new one-volume edition of it , enriched with drawings by Mr.
W. Small	PERSON	and with views of the
Doone	PERSON	country from the photographs taken expressly for the purpose by Mr.
Clifton Johnson	PERSON	, whose name is a warrant for the excellence of his work .

		The volume contains 560 close-printed pages , and its quality is surprisingly good consider - ing the moderate price asked for it .

		Mrs.
Clara Erskine Clement	PERSON	's acceptable little monograph on `` Heroines of the Bible in Art '' -LRB-
L. C. Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , with its thirty odd illustrations after famous painters , ancient and modern , forms a pretty gift-book which is timely in theme and sufficiently decorative in make-up .

		The dainty cover in light-blue with symbolical design in white and gold calls for a word of praise .

		Three new volumes in the familiar '' Thumb Nail Series '' -LRB-
The Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- present respect - ively a sheaf of selections from
Epictetus	ORGANIZATION	, edited 430 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, by Mr.
Benjamin E. Smith	PERSON	; Dr.
John Brown	PERSON	's ''
Rab	PERSON	and his Friends , '' with an Introduction by Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	; `` Motifs , '' by Mr.
E. Scott O'Connor	PERSON	, a volume of passing reflections , subtly conceived and daintily worded , with an Introduc - tion by Miss
Agnes Repplier	PERSON	.

		For a pretty and inexpensive gift to a friend of refined taste , one of these diminutive beautifully printed and chastely decorated volumes would answer nicely .

		A rich and racy flavor of Dixie Land pervades the flat folio volume entitled '' Down South '' -LRB-
R. H. Russell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The book is virtually an album of photo - graphic pictures illustrative of negro life and char - acter in the rural districts of the remoter South ; and the illustrator , Mr.
Rudolph Eickmeyer	PERSON	, Jr. , must be credited with unusual good taste in his selection of subjects , as well as with much skill in the use of the camera .

		A quiet humor pervades the pictures generally ; but there is a commendable absence of the burlesque element which caricatur - ists of negro life have accentuated ad nauseam .

		In fact , the book is a delightful one in its way a quiet , truthful reflection of a phase of American life now fading fast into history .

		A thoughtful preface is provided by Mr.
Joel Chandler Harris	PERSON	. ''

		Omarians '' will find their account this season in the artistic production entitled '' The Book of Omar and Rub & iya ` t '' -LRB-
M. F. Mansfield	PERSON	-RRB- , a pictor - ial and literary miscellany comprising among other unique features reprints of selected addresses made at the dinners of the
Omar Khayyam Club	ORGANIZATION	of
London	LOCATION	, facsimiles of menu and guest cards , etc. .

		The volume , a royal octavo of about a hundred pages , is beautifully printed from type , and the edition is limited to a thousand copies .

		Mention is deservedly made , by one of the contributors who writes of Omar 's translators , of the too-little-known version of Mr.
J. L. Garner	PERSON	, an American .

		Mr.
Garner	PERSON	's fine quatrain , '' The violets that by this river grow Sprang from some lip here buried long ago ; And tread thou lightly on this tender green , Who sleepeth here so still thou ne'er wilt know , '' is pronounced a `` much better '' rendering than the corresponding stanza by
Fitz-Gerald	ORGANIZATION	, a judgment which comparison easily bears out .

		Mr.
Garner	PERSON	's little book should be reprinted .

		The volume under review is of considerable artistic pretensions out - wardly , and contains several illustrations , among them a frontispiece on vellum , and a portrait of
Fitz-Gerald	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the cover-design and end-papers , the skill in decoration of Miss
Blanche McManus	PERSON	is again in evidence . ''

		A fine quotation , '' says
Roux	PERSON	, '' is a diamond on the finger of a man of wit . ''

		A shining collection of these gems may be found in the well-appointed volume entitled '' The World 's Best Proverbs '' -LRB-
Laird & Lee	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The compiler , Mr.
George Howard Opdyke	PERSON	, has taken unusual pains to marshal his selections in a convenient and even logical way .

		The proverbs are grouped by subjects alphabetic - ally arranged , with the happy results that the par - ticular maxim one may chance to want is easily found , and that a measure of continuity is imparted to the text .

		The book is ornately bound with a view to its suitableness as a gift , and contains several full-page illustrations .

		Mr.
Thomas Nelson Page	PERSON	's story of '' The Old Gentleman in the Black Stock '' is a good one for pictorial exploitation , as Mr.
Howard Chandler Christy	PERSON	's baker 's dozen of tinted drawings in
Scribner	ORGANIZATION	's new edition of the book attest .

		The story has been somewhat enlarged by Mr.
Page	PERSON	for this edition , and we should be quite willing to see it enlarged once more in the future , for it is one of the author 's best .

		Miss
Sarah Williams	PERSON	's '' Through the Year with Birds and Poets '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is an anthology of American bird-poems , the selections being classi - fied according to the seasons of the year , and sub - divided by months .

		The conception of the book is a happy one , and it has been well carried out .

		Ninety-nine American authors are represented , and there are 242 poems and extracts from poems , the whole making a volume of 350 pages .

		The full - page drawings of Mr.
Walter M. Hardy	PERSON	, though a little stiff and formal , are clear and accurate , and serve to illustrate rather than merely adorn .

		For a friend of a pious turn , the rather ornate but substantial volume entitled '' The Four
Evan	PERSON	- gelists in Classic Art '' -LRB-
Whittaker	PERSON	-RRB- should form a welcome and an edifying gift .

		The editor of the work , Miss
Rachel A. La Fontaine	PERSON	, has exercised due care and circumspection in selecting and arranging the somewhat multifarious writings , in prose and poetry , that form its content .

		The evangelical chronicles are rich in subject-matter for the religious painter , and the editor has had the advantage of a wide field of selection in choosing her illustrations .

		These comprise many well executed plates in half - tone , after representative artists , ancient and mod - ern .

		The volume is both seasonable in content and pleasing in form .

		Professor
H. Knackfuss	PERSON	's learned monograph on
Albrecht Diirer	PERSON	-LRB-
Lemcke & Buechner	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , trans - lated by Mr.
Campbell Dodgson	PERSON	, and illustrated by 134 reproductions of Dilrer 's works , is an art work of genuine worth that will be much prized by serious students of the Nuremburg master and his powerful productions .

		This thoroughly good though inexpensive book is the latest number in the series of monographs prepared under the super - vision of Prof.
Knackfuss	PERSON	and designed to form when complete a history of the great periods of art , though each volume is complete in itself .

		Mr.
Dodgson	PERSON	's good work as translator calls for special commendation .

		That old Greek fairy-tale , ever fresh and fair , of '' Eros and Psyche , '' gracefully re - told , after Apu - leius , by Dr.
Paul Carus	PERSON	, forms the basis and motif of the artistic embellishment of one of the prettiest of the smaller publications of the season .

		Mr.
Paul Thumann	PERSON	's exquisite series of drawings illustrative of the tale are reproduced in the volume , and form
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 431 its distinctive pictorial feature .

		Good taste , and a sense of the classic spirit , are everywhere shown in the make-up of the little book , which will surely find numerous friends .

		-LRB- The Open Court Publish -
ing Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Messrs.
Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	reissue their fine edition of
Charles Reade	PERSON	's masterpiece , '' The
Clois	PERSON	- ter and the Hearth , '' with the profuse and admir - able illustrations by Mr.
William Martin Johnson	PERSON	, which must be seen , and even closely inspected , to be appreciated .

		The work is easily one of the best publications of the kind ever produced , and its reappearance is welcome .

		Two prime old favorites in new and pleasing but comparatively inexpensive dress '' Ivanhoe '' and ``
John Halifax	PERSON	, Gentleman '' come to us from the
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		In each , the more note - worthy added feature is the series of twelve colored illustrations , those in '' Ivanhoe '' being the work of Mr.
Charles E. Brock	PERSON	, those in `` John
Halifax	LOCATION	'' of Messrs.
Cooke	PERSON	,
Fisher	PERSON	, and
Tilney	ORGANIZATION	.

		All the plates have the effect of water-color drawings , and most of them are cleverly and intelligently done .

		In the ''
John Halifax	PERSON	'' there is also a medallion portrait of Mrs.
Craik	PERSON	, and a photographic view in
Old Tewksbury	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volumes are printed and bound alike , and are evidently meant to be shelf companions .

		Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	's '' Rasselas , '' gotten out in neat and convenient form by
Messrs. James Pott & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is the promising initial volume in the `` Gem Classics '' series which will include such works as the `` Religio Medici , ''
Beckford	PERSON	's '' Vathek , '' Mrs.
Gatty	PERSON	's `` Par - ables from Nature , '' etc. .

		We understand that about seven volumes of the series are now ready .

		The volume is a duodecimo , bound in limp Venetian morocco , and contains a good frontispiece portrait reproduced in photogravure .

		Its moderate price considered , the set is unusually well made and attractive .

		Mrs.
Maud Wilder Goodwin	PERSON	's graceful colonial romance , '' The Head of a Hundred '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which we have already had occasion to commend , makes its appearance in tempting Holi - day dress , and with a half-dozen illustrations -LRB- the frontispiece in colors -RRB- from various hands .

		The volume forms a desirable gift-book of the more in - expensive class .

		Those popular companion books ''
Elizabeth	PERSON	and her German Garden '' and '' The Solitary Summer '' reappear boxed together as a set and with added material attractions , notably twenty-eight beautiful photogravures , fourteen to the volume , which dis - close at least the home surroundings of the author , but leave us still guessing at her identity .

		The author 's children appear in a few of the pictures , but even this possible clue proves deceptive , for the faces of the little ones are in each case either hidden or partly hidden through one pretty device or another .

		The remaining plates give some charm - ing glimpses of the garden and of the interior of the castle .

Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Redolent of the quaint humor and simple pathos of the old-fashioned plantation '' darky '' are the twenty-four songs , each with its accompanying drawing , in
Howard Weeden	PERSON	's '' Songs of the Old South '' -LRB-
Doubleday , Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The pictures , eight of which are printed in colors , show with a truth which there is no mistaking the
Southern	ORGANIZATION	negro of the old time , and the book generally is made up with a view to the demands of the Holi - day season . ''

		Loving Imprints : The Mother 's Album '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , compiled by Mrs.
Therese Goulston	PERSON	, is essentially a book of carefully prepared and ar - ranged blank forms for registering important family events births , betrothals , marriages , anniver - saries , deaths , and so forth for six generations .

		Provision for a pictorial element is made in the spaces reserved for unmounted photographs .

		The volume is the result of the editor 's personal need of such a book , and it appears to be as practical and convenient as it is tastily got up .

		Abundant good taste is displayed in the get-up of
Messrs. Dana Estes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's delicately bound volume entitled `` In the Sweetness of Childhood . ''

		The compiler of the book ,
Miss Grace Hartshorne	LOCATION	, has aimed to include in it the best available poems on the theme of childhood , omitting however some of the most hackneyed pieces in order to make room for selections which seem to her as meritori - ous , if less widely known , than the ones omitted .

		There are sixteen full-page illustrations , mostly after modern painters , which reflect the spirit , at least , of the text .

		Among recent successes in fiction , prominent place must be accorded those stirring and original tales by ``
Ralph Connor	PERSON	'' entitled `` Black Rock '' and `` The Sky Pilot . ''

		The sales of both books have passed the 50,000 mark , and their popularity shows no present signs of abatement .

		A welcome is therefore assured in advance to the handsome illustrated editions issued for the Holidays by the publishers ,
Fleming H. Revell Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The eight drawings contained in each volume are the work of Mr.
Louis Rhead	PERSON	, who has been fairly successful in depicting the vivid scenes of the narrative .

		The cover designs are uncommonly striking and effec - tive .

		That romantic old favorite '' The Scottish Chiefs '' -LRB- Button -RRB- appears in new and pleasing garb , the main feature of which is Mr.
T. H. Robinson	PERSON	's copious illustrations , including a colored frontis - piece .

		The character of ''
Wight Wallace	PERSON	'' has not gained through the researches of later histori - ans ; and it is pleasant to turn the page back and view
Scotia	LOCATION	's hero in the glamor of
Miss Porter	LOCATION	's time-honored pages .

		The attractive cover design in colors deserves a word of praise .

		Messrs.
Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	reprint their ornate Holiday edition of ''
Daisy Miller	PERSON	'' with the famil - iar drawings by Mr.
Harry W. McVickar	PERSON	.

		A tasty lilac binding freshens up this favorite of a p as t season , which should find many admirers thi s year .

		432 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, BOOKS FOR THE YOUNG .

		L Books for the coming generation reflect the luxury of the age to an extent which takes from them some - thing of their American flavor .

		This is especially true of the tales of school and contemporaneous life pro- vided for the reading of the year .

		Not so long ago the boys we read about were in comfortable pecuniary circumstances , nothing more .

		When they wished something by way of toy or implement for sport , they made it themselves whenever possible , or earned and saved money for purchasing it , being self-dependent in either case .

		Now , the boys seem to have many more things done for them .

		Their apparatus for enjoyment has been increased , though it is very doubtful if any higher degree of pleasure has come with it .

		The schools have boys with longer purses among their stu - dents , and the hero who begins as a poor , unnoticed lad with funny clothing made by the village tailor , devel - ops into the very young man of the world under the influence of the youths of wealth and fashion who asso - ciate with him .

		The subject of war is holding its prominent place of the last year or two , so far as the books for children are concerned .

		Many of these deal with events now pass - ing , such as the wars in
South Africa	LOCATION	and the
Philip	LOCATION	- pines .

		Many others go back to the small beginnings of the nation , as if seeking an antidote to the greater extravagance in expenditure of modern life even while they provide the nation with an historical perspective and its inhabitants with almost unsuspected ancestors .

		The highest praise , that of imitation , continues to be paid the creations of the late ''
Lewis Carroll	PERSON	, '' as seen in the multiplicity of books of the '' Alice in Wonder - land '' kind .

		Nature , too , occupies a growing part in the instruction of the young , the less we live in nature the more there being to tell about it for purposes of information .

		Of books which serve a useful end in history , and similar works , there is a plenty ; but a lack of real literary work is to be complained of , and the heroes of peace play a rather insignificant part in comparison with the heroes of war .

		The strenuous life 's the thing , apparently , though the very books which tell of the past prove that we Americans have never required any encouragement to that end .

		The more frequent appearance of the Indian in boys ' books this year tells the same story .

		stories of Beginning with books that have a value European chiefly historical , the palm is to be history .

G. Laurence Gomme	PERSON	, with an abundance of pictures from the clever pen of Miss
Helen Stratton	PERSON	.

		It is the fourth of a series dealing with English roy - alty and its scions , starting from the
Norman Conquest	ORGANIZATION	and coming down to the reign of Victoria the Good The thousandth anniversary of the death of the Queen 's most illustrious ancestor brings forth Dr.
Eva March Tappan	PERSON	's '' In the Days of Alfred the Great '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , with pictures by Mr.
Kennedy	PERSON	.

		The author is a careful student of history in the fullest sense of the word , and has been enabled to add some excellent new anecdotes of a most interesting life to those already familiar .

		Another anniversary , and the consequent attention paid to the career of
Cromwell	LOCATION	, brings before the public Captain
F. S. Brereton	PERSON	's `` In the King 's Service '' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- , a rattling good tale of
Cromwell	ORGANIZATION	's invasion of
Ireland	LOCATION	with the
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	- ary army , the hero ,
Dick Granville	PERSON	, being on the other side .

		With `` In the Irish Brigade , a Tale of the War in
Flanders	LOCATION	and
Spain	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , our esteemed friend , Mr.
George Alfred Henty	PERSON	, makes his fifth or sixth score bow to the younger reading population , with a stirring story of the
early eighteenth century	DATE	, when
England	LOCATION	was warring through the Low Coun - tries and Uncle Toby left it of record that the army swore terribly .

		Mr.
Charles M. Sheldon	PERSON	, curiously duplicating the American clergyman 's name , provides the striking illustrations .

		Of a milder and purely feminine sort , yet with its interest largely in the his - torical atmosphere which envelops the characters , Miss
Sarah Tytler	PERSON	-LRB-
Henrietta Keddie	PERSON	-RRB- writes '' Queen Char - lotte 's Maidens '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , a picturesque romance for older girls , but one to be commended on many ac - counts .

		Mr.

Garibaldi	PERSON	, a Story of the Liberation of

Maine	LOCATION	to
Louisiana	LOCATION	by way of
Florida	LOCATION	, in which the young tourists have their cup of inquisi - tiveness regarding the early life of the country filled almost to overflowing .

		Plentiful illustrations from photographs , and a decorative cover by Mr.
T. Guern	PERSON	- sey
Moore	PERSON	, enhance the value of the book , which is a companion to a similar work treating of Revolutionary scenes published two years ago . ''

		The House-Boat on the
St. Lawrence	LOCATION	; or , Following Frontenac '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a story of similar design , and , also , the companion volume to a previous work , from the pleas - ant pen of Dr.
Everett T. Tomlinson	PERSON	.

		The same boys , now a year older , who followed the trail of Cartier a twelvemonth ago , are now engaged with
Frontenac	ORGANIZATION	's eventful history in the Canadian wilderness .

		It is worthily done .

		As the last of the four books of the `` Young Puritans '' series -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , '' The Young and Old Puritans of Hatfield , '' written by Mrs.
Mary P. Wells Smith	PERSON	and illustrated by Miss
Bertha C. Day	PERSON	, proves the wealth of material which lies in the annals of every
New England	LOCATION	town of early founda - tion , here containing a most exciting account of the capture and rescue of some of the inhabitants of Hat - field at the end of
King Philip	LOCATION	's war .

		For still smaller children ,
Miss Edith Robinson	PERSON	has written '' A Little Puritan 's First Christmas '' -LRB- Page -RRB- , the little Puritan being the quaintly old-fashioned
Betty Sewall	PERSON	, as she appears in her learned father 's pious and juri - dical pages .

		The drawings , by Mrs.
Amy M. Sacker	PERSON	, include a portrait of the small heroine .

Jersey Shore	ORGANIZATION	in the Days of the Revolution . ''

		The enormities of the British prison ships deserve setting forth at this time , and Dr.
Tomlinson	PERSON	is to be commended for his work , though he has ameliorated the British excesses .

		The spirited pictures in the book are by Mr.
Frank E. Schoonover	PERSON	'' Scouting for

Buller	PERSON	in

		It is written from the strongest possible British point of view , and so glosses over the accounts given in
America	LOCATION	of Gen - eral
Buller	PERSON	's movements that it hardly seems possible Mr.
Henty	PERSON	can be serious .

		Captain
F. S. Brereton	PERSON	is more fortunate in his choice of material when he writes '' With Rifle and Bayonet , a Tale of the Boer War '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , since he gives his hero ,

Atlantic	LOCATION	coast of
America	LOCATION	, a fight between British and French sailors in
Newfoundland	LOCATION	being one of the interesting episodes .

		The rush for gold to the northern

		There is some well deserved commendation of

		These conclude a series of four volumes which are replete with good ideas for keeping youngsters out of mischief at the most mischievous age , and there is a fifth volume for the boys ' sisters written by Mr.

		First of a new series to be named after '' The United States Government '' is a book called '' The
Treasury Club	ORGANIZATION	'' -LRB-

William Drysdale	PERSON	.

		It is an intelli - gently-written narrative in story form , the boy hero entering the federal treasury department and passing through its routine , meeting its responsible heads and gaining a comprehension of its workings , which he im - parts to his readers .

		The idea is both good in itself and commendably worked out .

		Mr.
Charles Battell Loomis	PERSON	has never written a book for the young in years before , limiting his efforts in authorship to those who were young in mind .

		But his success in '' Yankee En - chantments '' -LRB-

		All of his humor is preserved in this story of the modern Amer - ican sort of fairy , the wonderful genie who has made liquid air , trolley cars , and automobiles possible , and it may be read by children of all ages .

		Nearly two-score pictures by Miss

Miss Gabrielle E. Jackson	PERSON	's '' Pretty

		Mr.

		It is a kindly book , like all of Mrs.

		``

America	LOCATION	is told in a manner almost whimsical by
Miss A. G. Plympton	PERSON	in '' A Child of Glee '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It tells of a little Yankee girl who gets en - tangled in the politics and diplomacy of a European court , and comes out with credit to herself , her father , and her fellow countrymen .

		`` A Georgian Bungalow '' -LRB-
Hough	PERSON	ton -RRB- is to be welcomed , like others of Mrs.

		Negro fidel - ity and a picturesque German governess add to the interest of the story , which is well illustrated .

		Mrs.
Molesworth	PERSON	's `` The House that Grew '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- turns out to be a wagonette , and the pictures by Miss
Alice Woodward	PERSON	make the story one to be laughed with and over in every respect .

		It has all the author 's established knowledge of girl life .

		Before passing to the books designed an < t V fablt * ^ or very sma ^ S ^ s an -LRB- ^ boys , we must take note of the number of interesting fairy tales which can be read with delight by all who have not let work and the daily grind of life interfere too much with their imaginations .

		Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	has edited this year '' The Grey Fairy Book '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , carrying on his chromatic scheme another step .

		The stories are from translations made by many hands and are illustrated by Mr.
A. J. Ford	PERSON	.

		Mr.
William Canton	PERSON	, whose original work for children has won so many golden opinions , acts as editor for a series of '' The True Annals of Fairy Land '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , the initial volume being entitled specifically '' The Reign of King Herla . ''

		The occurrences of that momentous stretch of years requires a skilled anachronist for chronicler , since the Argonauts and
King Lear	ORGANIZATION	both find a place between its opening and close .

		The de - lightful drawings of Mr.
Charles Robinson	PERSON	make the book an ideal one either for keeping or giving away .

		Between Mrs.
Mabel Osgood Wright	PERSON	's delicate sense of humor in prose and Mr.
Oliver Herford	PERSON	's delicious no - tion of fun in drawings , '' The Dream Fox Story Book '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- fares sumptuously according to its kind .

		There is fun enough in every page to make the reader wish he had the dream fox habit himself .

		Mr.
Seumas MacManus	PERSON	and Mr.
Frank Verbeck	PERSON	combine to make '' Donegal Fairy Stories '' -LRB-
McClure , Phillips & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- a rollicking bit of Irish exaggeration , carrying it almost to the point of burlesque .

		More discrimina - ting by far is Mr.
William Henry Frost	PERSON	's '' Fairies and Folk of
Ireland	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , which has the real Celtic flavor .

		We are somewhat at a loss to account for the use here of some of Mr.
William Butler Yeats	PERSON	's tender imaginings , much as they endance the feeling to which the book is committed .

		Another of the great families of the Celtic race is drawn upon for the material in `` Fairy Stories from the Little Mountain '' -LRB-
Wessels	PERSON	-RRB- , which Mr.
John Finnemore	PERSON	has brought together and Mr.
James R. Sinclair	PERSON	made pictures for .

		Pretty drawings by Mr.
Reginald Birch	PERSON	and other artists of skill reinforce the pleasant impression the book leaves upon the reader 's mind .

		That dreamlike confusion of the actual Impossible and tbe i mpo88 ibl e which was so peculi - realities , .

		f , r arly the invention or the late ''
Lewis Carroll	PERSON	'' has its counterpart in many a volume put out this year .

		Mr.
L. Frank Baum	PERSON	frankly acknowledges his obligations to his more original predecesssor in '' A New Wonderland '' -LRB- Russell -RRB- , with its quaint pictures by Mr.
Frank Verbeck	PERSON	.

		But Mr.
Dodgson	PERSON	bad a real distinction of style which is wholly lacking here , though to be found in a chapter or two of Mr.
Baum	PERSON	's other book , The Wonderful Wizard of Oz '' -LRB- Hill -RRB- , which is remarkably illustrated by Mr.
William W. Denslow	PERSON	, who possesses all the originality of method which has been denied his collaborator .

		This last book is really notable among the innumerable publications of the year , making an appeal which is fairly irresistible to a certain standard of taste Fastidious tastes will place Miss
Katharine Pyle	PERSON	's '' The Christmas Angel '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- at the other end of the aesthetic scale , the unity of conception of the artist-author being in its favor .

		Though intended for little children , it can be read with real comprehension by their elders for all the odd little turns of thought through which it wanders to a happy close . ''

		Josey and the Chipmunk '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the result of Mr.
Sydney Reid	PERSON	's pen and Miss
Fanny Cory	ORGANIZATION	's pencil , and includes a large menagerie among its dramatis personie .

McClure , Phillips & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- for which Mr.
James M. Conde	PERSON	* has made the illustrations and Mr.

Acta Sanctorum	ORGANIZATION	of the stories of friendliness which exists between men of peace and holiness and the rest of the animate world .

		Miss
Fanny Y. Cory	ORGANIZATION	carries out the mediaeval feeling of the tales in her cleverly conventionalized drawings , and the whole effect is one to rejoice in .

		A wide world away is Mr.
Joaquin Miller	PERSON	's '' True Bear Stories '' -LRB-
Rand	ORGANIZATION	,
McNally & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a volume which the author 's active imagination relieves from any charge of being merely true .

		The book is fully illustrated , and fortu - nate in having an introduction written for it by Dr.
David Starr Jordan	PERSON	. ''

		The Animal Alphabet '' -LRB- Hill -RRB- contains prose and verse written by Mr.
Henry Morrow Hyde	PERSON	and a full series of pictures from photographs taken from life by Mr.
Charles C. Cook	PERSON	.

		The book is entertaining , but the photographs lose effect owing to the process adopted .

		Mr.
Ernest Seton-Thompson	PERSON	's `` Wild Animal Play '' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- utilizes the charac - ters from the author 's successful book , `` Wild Animals I Have Known , '' with pictures and rhymes by his own hand .

		But it is very thin , and can be satisfactory to none but small children . ''

		Mooswa and Others of the Boundaries '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is a book of the genre of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's `` Jungle Stories , '' written by Mr.
W. A. Fraser	PERSON	, and illustrated by Mr.
Arthur Heming	PERSON	.

		The scenes are laid in the far North of the

F. S. Marvin	PERSON	,
R. J. C. Mayor	PERSON	and
F. M. Stawell	PERSON	.

		The spirit of the original has been fairly caught and held in so far as a translation can hold it , and the book is a worthy one in all respects Messrs.
G. W. Boden	PERSON	and
W. Barrington	PERSON	d'Almeida have done a similar good service for another Greek in '' Wonder Stories from Herodotus '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- .

		A tribute to the veracity of the

		Such a book will be found in '' Chinese Mother Goose Rhymes '' -LRB-
Revell	PERSON	-RRB- , translated and illustrated by Mr.
Isaac Taylor Headland	PERSON	of
the University of Pekin	ORGANIZATION	.

		Quaint and curious as it is , it can - not be read by the least observant without the assurance that the Chinese are strangely human , all reports to the contrary notwithstanding .

		The accuracy of the trans - lation being vouched for , it is impossible to conceive of any vast or any essential difference between nations whose children delight in exactly the same turns of thought and fancy Mrs.
Alice Archer Sewall	PERSON	writes the verses and makes the drawings for '' The Ballad of the Prince '' -LRB-
Russell	PERSON	-RRB- , a delightfully humorous bit of work which requires some age to appreciate its mani - fold merits , quickly as a child will grasp the surface meaning .

Hilda Cowham	PERSON	for such well-known jingles as '' This Little Pig Went to Market . ''

Russell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Miss Hay is evidently preparing to take her place among the better-known writers of the day , her work here , slight as it is , showing both skill and painstaking , in addition to considerable talent .

		MR.

Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- which he has now put forth .

		The essays in this volume are ten in num - ber , discussing such writers as
Tennyson	LOCATION	,
Hawthorne	LOCATION	,
Poe	PERSON	, and
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	, such subjects as '' The Romantic Movement '' and '' Impressionism and Ap - preciation . ''

		They are well worthy of attention .

		Volume XII .

		of the larger ''
Temple	ORGANIZATION	'' Shakespeare -LRB- Dent-Macmillan -RRB- contains the poems and sonnets , together with a life of the poet , and completes this highly satisfactory edition .

		Messrs.
Crane & Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Topeka	LOCATION	, are the publishers of '' Economics , '' a school and college text-book by Dr.
Frank W. Blackmar	PERSON	.

		The volume contains over five hundred pages of matter , and , being rather con - densed in statement , covers an unusual extent of ground .

		Nos. 104 to 111 of the '' Old South Leaflets '' come to us bound together into a pamphlet .

		They have for their general subject '' The United States in the Nine - teenth Century , '' and include papers by
Jefferson	PERSON	,
Calhoun	PERSON	,
Lincoln	LOCATION	,
Horace Mann	PERSON	,
Rufus Choate	PERSON	, and Kossuth . ''

		The Chord , '' which is an English quarterly peri - odical devoted to the art of music , begins its second year with the number dated
September	DATE	, and just re - ceived by us .

		It is imported by the
A. Wessels Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and differs from most periodicals in the fact that each number , a small quarto in size , is neatly bound in boards .

		`` The Immortal , '' `` Thirty Years in
Paris	LOCATION	, '' and '' Little What 's His Name , '' together with a number of minor pieces , form the contents of three new volumes in the library edition of Daudet published by Messrs.
Little	PERSON	,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
George Burnham Ives	PERSON	is the translator of the first two of these volumes , and Miss

		Volumes III. , V. , and VI .

		of '' The World 's Orators , '' edited by Dr.
Guy Carleton Lee	PERSON	, have just been pub - lished by Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		Volume III .

		includes orators of the early and mediaeval church , with examples of such men as

Bacon	LOCATION	,
Eliot	LOCATION	,
Strafford	LOCATION	,
Cromwell	PERSON	,
Walpole	LOCATION	,
Burke	PERSON	, the
Pitts	LOCATION	, Fox , and
Sheridan	PERSON	.

		The numerous portrait illustrations constitute a particularly attractive feature of these handsome volumes .

		Messrs.
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	send us three French texts that are sure of a welcome .

		Professor
E. E. Brandon	PERSON	is the editor of an abridgment of '' Le Comte de Monte - Cristo , '' and Professor
E. S. Lewis	PERSON	has edited -LRB- but without abridgment -RRB- '' La Tulipe Noire . ''

		Our third text is a '' Histoire de
France	LOCATION	, '' extracted from the courses of M. Ducoudray by Professor O. B. Super .

		The
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish the '' Elements of Physics , '' as prepared for high schools by Professors
Henry A. Rowland	PERSON	and
Joseph S. Ames	PERSON	.

		It is a for - tunate thing that writers of such eminence are willing to devote their attention to elementary manuals of this sort , and the book again reminds us how much better off is the science teacher of to-day than was his prede - cessor of not many years - ago .

		Messrs. Silver ,
Burdett , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish a volume en - titled '' Ballads of American Bravery , '' and edited by Mr.
Clinton Scollard	PERSON	.

		How strictly up-to-date is the selection is shown by the fact that it includes such recent poets as Mr.
Wallace Rice	PERSON	and Mr.
Barrett	PERSON	East - man , such recent themes as
Santiago	LOCATION	and
Manila	LOCATION	.

		But the older poets and the older heroisms are by no means neglected .

		The editor had the uses of schools in mind when he made this collection , but others than teachers will be glad to have it .

		Professor
J. B. Bury	PERSON	's '' History of
Greece	LOCATION	to the Death of Alexander the Great , '' published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	, achieves the difficult aim of being equally valuable for the college student and for the general reader .

		The author is an accomplished scholar as well as the master of a dignified style , and the nine hundred pages of his work leave little to be desired as to either content or form .

		The illustrations , although not numerous , are judiciously chosen , and add much to the value of the work .

		Still another '' Source Book of English History '' has just been published .

		It is the work of Miss
Elizabeth Kimball Kendall	PERSON	, and bears the imprint of the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Designed for students and general readers alike , it is evident that an important aim of the work is to provide a suitable collection of source ma - terial for use in connection with the manual of English history which Miss
Kendall	PERSON	prepared a year or two ago in collaboration with
Miss Coman	PERSON	, her fellow instructor in
Wellesley College	LOCATION	.

		It should be promptly introduced into all the schools that make use of that admirable text-book .

		We have received from the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	a copy of their '' two-version '' edition of the
Bible	LOCATION	, a publication which gives the text of the Authorized Version , and , in the margin of each page , all of the alterations , down to the minutest detail of punctuation , made by the scholars to whom we owe the Revised Version .

		This arrangement obviates the vexatious necessity of consulting two volumes at the same time , and will be welcomed by Bible workers of every sort .

		The volume is otherwise a wonder of book-making , being printed on
Oxford India	ORGANIZATION	paper , the
1384	DATE	pages , together with the indexed atlas , making a volume of about one inch in thickness .

		It is bound in flexible seal , with gold edges .

		Courant -LRB-

		An artistic work ... Delightful ... instructive .

		Constitution -LRB-
Atlanta	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		A book to be treasured .

		Serenely philosophical , keenly observ - ant , ` intellectually suggestive , the placid marshalling of the less obvious facts of nature , with their gentle spiritual interpretation from Dr.
Abbott	PERSON	's pen to make us all human together , is a real triumph of literature .

		The Dial -LRB-

		It is a delight equally to the outward eye and `` that inward eye which is the bliss of solitude . ''

		A beautiful book that will delight every lover of Nature in its quiet haunts ... The book is an educator in its best meaning to old and young alike .

		Inter Ocean -LRB-
Chicago	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		Dr.
Abbott	PERSON	has long held an honored place among the few true lovers of nature whom she has .

		blessed with the gift of telling to others the secrets she betrays only to her votaries , the delights she gives freely to those who will search for them diligently , with eyes to see and ears to hear ... These studies gain by a second reading , and a third , as does their reader .

		The illustrator must be in close touch with
Nature	ORGANIZATION	himself ; he certainly is with his author , the charm of ^ whose text he interprets with rare felicity .

		Mail and Express -LRB-
N.Y.	LOCATION	-RRB- Not long ago , in reviewing Mr.
Wishart	PERSON	's important history of `` Monks and Monasteries , '' The Times had occasion to speak of the dignified form which had been given to the book by a new publisher ,
Albert Brandt	PERSON	, of
Trenton	LOCATION	.

		From the
Brandt	PERSON	press we have now another noteworthy volume , presenting the work of a familiar author , but presenting it with a richness of external form it has not had before .

		This is '' In Nature 's Realm , '' by Dr.
Charles C. Abbott	PERSON	.

		All readers are familiar with Dr.
Abbott	PERSON	's sympathetic nature studies .

		He is one of those men , like White of
Selborne	LOCATION	, who do not need to go far afield to find matter to interest them ; to whom the woods and meadows , the streams and the skies of their own vicinage are unfailing sources of delight ; who know the signs of the seasons and their myriad manipulations of animal and vegetable life , and who can describe what they see , not merely with scientific accuracy , but with poetic appreciation ... The dainty vignettes and marginal illustrations which decorate the fine broad pages are the work of
Oliver Kemp	PERSON	, who is to be credited also with the fascinating cover design ... Mr.
Brandt	PERSON	lias presented his neighbor 's work in a form of which it is altogether worthy , and has made a book that will attract attention by its beauty .

		When
James Anthony Froude	PERSON	undertook to write the History of the Saints he encountered the same obstacles that
Alfred Wesley Wishart	PERSON	met in writing his excellent work , `` Monks and Monasteries . ''

		There were unlimited materials from which to draw , but without suf - ficient authenticity to justify the record to be made up from them .

		The late professor of history at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	gave up the task as a vain one , but Mr.
Wishart	PERSON	has pursued his to a successful conclusion , and hav - ing winnowed the grain from its disproportionate quantity of chaff , presents us with a volume for which students and general readers must alike feel grateful .

		He has sifted his authorities so carefully that the book has the stamp of truth in every statement placed there , however so deftly , tint the literary grace of the work is fully and delightfully preserved .

		Scholarly without being pedantic , earnest and careful without showing either prejudice or partisanship , he sweeps the great field which his title includes , with a strength and evenness that give the book the hall-mark of sterling worth .

		His con - clusions are drawn upon no hypothetical grounds , and if modestly pre - sented do not lack the convincing qualities which Mr.
Wishart	PERSON	so plainly sees and so effectively puts into view .

		The scene of this remarkable story is laid in the Oil Lands of

		The public , a-weary of novels which enfold problems as sugar plums encase pills , will enjoy a powerful , vivid , realistic story that deals with no abstruse enigma beyond the old sad puzzle of love , labor , sin , and suffering .

		The movement quietly sustained in the earlier chapters rises artistically to a thrilling climax as the tale goes on .


Marion Harland	PERSON	has never done a better piece of work , and the strong hand and lively imagination of her collaborator infuse virile power into certain passages and chapters .

		As the first instance in the history of literature in which mother and son have written a book in partnership , '' Dr.

		THE REVIEW OF REVIEWS man or woman in
America	LOCATION	who wants to keep up with the times and have the best aids in existence to '' getting ahead '' in business and in mental growth ; who wants to have in the home library the standard intellectual hand-books , will be interested in this remarkable offer .

		The
Review of Reviews	ORGANIZATION	, under Dr.
Albert Shaw	PERSON	's editorship , has become known throughout
America	LOCATION	as the `` necessary magazine '' the one monthly journal which effectively states and explains the great questions of the day , gives the timely news of the important events of the month , and summarizes the most notable articles of the other magazines of the world .

		THE CENTURY MAGAZINE The Century is known all over the world , and Americans do not need to be told of its excellence as an illustrated magazine of fiction , art , poetry , and miscellany .

		As such , it makes a remarkably felicitous combination with THE REVIEW OF REVIEWS , occupied as the latter is with the public questions of the day .

		The regular price of
The Century	ORGANIZATION	is
$ 4.00	MONEY	per year .

		THE CENTURY ATLAS The person who appreciates the endless value a really good atlas has for man , woman , and child in the home naturally wants the best , the standard work , accurate to the last degree , with all the resources of the geographer , the map-maker , the statistician , and the historio - grapher lavished upon it .

		Such an institution as the
Century Atlas of the World	ORGANIZATION	helps to set the intellectual standards of any household ; it is simply invaluable to a man in business , professional , or public life .

		The Century Atlas of the World is an entirely new work , designed to exhibit not only the latest geographical knowledge , but also political changes .

		It is , in fact , the first really comprehensive up-to-date atlas of the whole world ; for similar European works have neglected the
United States	LOCATION	, and American works have been generally unsatisfactory in their treatment of
Europe	LOCATION	and the
Far East	LOCATION	.

		The Century Atlas alone gives the results of the latest explorations , and such recent political changes as the annexation of
Hawaii	LOCATION	, the results of our war with
Spain	LOCATION	, and the limits of the
Greater New York	LOCATION	.

		People of taste regard a really excellent map as a work of art .

		The
Century Atlas	ORGANIZATION	, prepared under the same editorial management as the great
Century Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	, has none except models in this sort of map - making , in scheme and in mechanical execution .

		There are over three hundred up-to-date maps , the foreign names of the maps being translated .

		The Atlas is an imposing and sumptuous volume , the size 10 x 13 inches ; every mechanical detail is as nearly perfect as the best modern printer 's art can make it .

		The volume we offer is very handsomely bound in half morocco .

		The regular price is $ i 7 .

Barrett Wendell	PERSON	's '' Literary History of
America	LOCATION	. ''

		The plan of the series of literary histories for which this work has been written , and of which it is much the most important volume thus far published , calls for far more than a collection of biog - raphies , bibliographical annals , and critical commentaries .

		It calls , indeed , for a history no less faithful to the service of Clio than the histories whose titles are modified by no qual - ifying adjective ; but it calls at the same time for a shifting of the point of view that will bring literature , rather than politics or stra - tegics , into the foreground .

		Such a treatment of English history has been attempted by the distinguished French scholar ,
M. Jnsserand	PERSON	; 486 THE DIAL -LSB- Dee .

		16 , such a treatment of American history is now given us by Professor
Wendell	PERSON	.

		It is only when discussed from this standpoint that American literature is given its full signifi - cance , for its absolute assthetic value is not great , relatively speaking , while no value could well be greater than that which it has for the interpretation of the national develop - ment , or for the appeal which it makes to the national consciousness . ''

		The literary history of
America	LOCATION	, '' says the author , '' is the story , under new conditions , of those ideals which a common language has compelled
America	LOCATION	, almost unawares , to share with
England	LOCATION	.

		Elusive though they be , ideals are the souls of the nations which cherish them , the living spirits which waken nation - ality into being , and which often preserve its memory long after its life has ebbed away .

		Denied by the impatience which will not seek them where they smoulder beneath the cinders of cant , derided by the near-sighted wisdom which is content with the world-old common - place of how practice must always swerve from precept , they mysteriously , resurgently persist . ''

		The possession of certain ideals in common with the island race from which we have sprung may be taken as the guiding principle of the writer 's treatment of American literature .

		In assuming this basic proposition he plants himself upon solid ground , upon ground far more solid than that of the critic who is ever on the lookout for differentia in - stead of devoting his efforts to making clear the underlying unity of all the literature writ - ten in the English language .

		Nationality is far more a matter of language than of race or descent , and '' these languages which we speak grow more deeply than anything else to be a part of our mental habit who use them . ''

		To take a single illustration of this principle , there was never uttered a philosophical truth more profound than that embodied in Words - worth 's familiar lines , '' We must be free or die , who speak the tongue That Shakespeare spake ; the faith and morals hold Which
Milton	PERSON	held . ''

		That is the real secret of English democracy , and it also offers for the explanation of Ameri - can democracy a cause far more adequate than any superficial attempt to account for it as resulting from foreign influence .

		It is a part of the critic 's business , no doubt , to detect differentia between the varieties of English expression in various lands , and they are not lacking between the literatures of
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	.

		Each country has its own landscapes , .

		its own trees and flowers and birds , its own historical traditions , and a civ - ilization moulded by its own form and pressure .

		But it is a mistake to exalt these minor diver - gences into generic distinctions , for they are much less than that , and serve chiefly to bring into clearer view the ideal community of the two bodies of literature , doing this by the very contrast between their unimportance and the importance of the deep spiritual traits upon which all these differences are the merest sur - face variations .

		We may possibly allow the ad - ditional drop of nervous fluid which Colonel
Higginson	PERSON	claims for the American , but be - yond this we may hardly go and remain philo - sophical of mind .

		We have never seen a better statement than is now given us by Professor
Wendell	PERSON	of the indissoluble unity of English and American literary expression .

		`` The ideals which for three hundred years
America	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	have cherished , alike yet apart , are ideals of morality and of government , of right and of rights .

		Whoever has lived his conscious life in the terms of our language , so saturated with the temper and the phrases both of the English Bible and of English Law , has perforce learned that , however he may stray , he can not escape the duty which bids us do right and maintain our rights .

		General as these phrases must seem , common at first glance to the serious moments of all men everywhere , they have , for us of English-speaking race , a meaning peculiarly our own .

		Though Englishmen have prated enough and to spare , and though Amer - icans have declaimed about human rights more nebulously still , the rights for which English - men and Americans alike have been eager to fight and to die , are no prismatic fancies gleaming through clouds of conflicting logic and metaphor ; they are that living body of customs and duties and privileges , which a process very like physical growth has made the vital condition of our national existence .

		Through immemorial experience , the rights which we most jealously cherish have proved themselves safely favourable at once to pros - perity and to righteousness . ''

		It is this two - fold idealism , of right and of rights , that has made English literature everywhere essentially the same , and a realization of this truth should rebuke the sectional pride which seeks to make barriers out of trifles , and find radical diverg - ences in the surface-play of expression .

		It is in this spirit that Professor
Wendell	PERSON	has dealt
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 487 with the three completed centuries of American literature , not minimizing the individual pecu - liarities of writers or the special characteristics of groups , nor failing to recognize American - ism as a trait where it really exists , but keep - ing ever in mind the correlations of English and American history , and the fundamental unity of the two peoples as expressed in their institutions , their laws , their social and ethical outlook .

		The chief distinction to be drawn between English and American literature is concerned , not with any fundamental difference of tem - per , but a difference in the rate of develop - ment .

		No one can even glance over the selec - tions made for the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in such a work as
Duyckinck	PERSON	, or in the later '' Library '' of Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	, without being impressed by the fact that the American literary manner was at all times a generation , if not a century , behind the English .

		This fact has many times been noted , but it has remained for the author of the work now under consideration to place due emphasis upon it , and to give it the prominence it de - mands in a survey of early American liter - ature .

		To begin with , he notes the fact that all of the famous first settlers of
Plymouth	LOCATION	and
Massachusetts Bay Bradford	LOCATION	, Win - throp ,
Cotton	ORGANIZATION	,
Hooker	PERSON	,
Richard Mather	PERSON	,
Roger Williams	PERSON	, and the rest , were born
Elizabeth	PERSON	- ans , although not '' quite the kind of
Eliza	PERSON	- bethans who expressed themselves in poetry . ''

		Now the characteristics of the Elizabethan spirit were these '' spontaneity , enthusiasm , and versatility , '' and if we look aright we shall discover that such were also the charac - teristics of our own writers of the seventeenth and even the eighteenth centmry .

		Taking Cotton Mather as the typical man of letters of the two centuries in question , the writer boldly testifies to the vitality of his enthusi - asm , the spontaneity of his utterance , and his possession of '' just that kind of restless versatility which characterized
Elizabethan England	ORGANIZATION	and which even to our own day has remained characteristic of
New England Yankees	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The
New England	LOCATION	colonies re - mained practically uninfluenced by the social and political movements of the mother coun - try , and '' in history and literature alike , the story of seventeenth-century
America	LOCATION	is a story of unique national inexperience . ''

		In the century following , came the preaching of
Whitefield	PERSON	and the Great Awakening , and when the Revolution was ripe it '' once more brought to the surface of American life the sort of natures whom the
Great Awakening	ORGANIZATION	shows so fully to have preserved the spontane - ity and the enthusiasm of earlier days . ''

		The conclusion of all this argument is expressed by saying that '' the Americans of the revolu - tionary period retained to an incalculable degree qualities which had faded from ances - tral
England	LOCATION	with the days of Queen
Eliza	PERSON	- beth . ''

		This line of thought may be pursued down into the history of our literature during a con - siderable part of the century just ending , and it was not until we had a great national experience of our own that we produced a body of literature not closely associated with the earlier types of literature in our ancestral home .

		Up to the mid-century period when our literature first allied itself with a burning national issue , and became more distinctly American than it ever could have been before , there continued to be reversions to manners and forms of expression that were long out - worn in
England	LOCATION	.

		Space forbids us to continue the subject any farther , but enough has been said to show how fruitful a formula has been applied by Professor
Wendell	PERSON	to the analysis of our literary past .

		It remains to add that he has produced incomparably the best history of American literature thus far written by any - body , a history that is searching in its method and profound in its judgments , on the one hand , and , on the other , singularly attractive in the manner of its presentation .

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		RECENT CHRISTMAS POETRY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DJAL . -RRB-

		In looking over our Christmas magazines of the past few years no easy task when taken systematically , but very good browsing for the frivolous one may notice our Christmas poetry as having a distinct share in the modern Romantic Revival .

		We are using , far more than formerly , the mysterious quality of the story , the mingling of the plain and the wonderful , the effective tone re-produced after a Pre-Raphaelite fashion of '' archaic simplicity and Catholic fervor . ''

		We have ancient Christmas ballads and legends , made over for us and refined to exquisiteness , yet still suggesting their primitive and dramatic intentions ; we have new carols in the old style ; and , old or new , in their apprehension of The Mother and The Child , we have a reminder of the medieval painters .

		For example if one must choose take this : '' The holly-berry 's red as blood , And the holly bears a thorn , And the manger-bed is a
Holy Rood Where Jesus Christ	ORGANIZATION	was born . ''

		488 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, It is the beginning of a modern carol , in which the symbolism of the red blossom , the thorn , and the cross - shaped manger , suggest the decoration of some old missal .

		The mother , with prophetic vision , sees the form of the bed and shudders at it : '' ' Jt minds me of a cross of wood ! '

		Cried
Mary	PERSON	, all forlorn . ''

		She covers the wood with hay , to hide the piercing symbol , but the cattle eat it away , and the cross is again bare to her sight .

		Here , as in Hunt 's '' Light of the World , '' or as in
Rossetti	PERSON	's '' Girlhood of Mary '' I take these at random from a host of such pictures is that touch of deliberate intent which goes to make simplicity not simple ; yet the general effect is one of mediaeval naloel ' e and sincerity .

		We might choose again , and quote from a little poem of Miss
Guiney	PERSON	's an imitation , perhaps , but so frank and sweet that we can put up with the antique spelling : '' The Ox , he openeth wide the Doore , And from the
Snowe	PERSON	he culls her inne , And he hath seen her Smile therefore , Our Ladye without sinne . ''

		Another too lovely to be resisted is an adaptation from the Provencal , telling of a widowed mother , very poor , and with no gift for the
Holy Child	ORGANIZATION	save her own child 's cradle and pillow .

		She would carry Him these , but feels that it may be wrong to rob her own .

		Then '' Oh miracle !

		The nursing babe , The babe , e ` en as he fed , Smiled in his tender mother 's face .

		And , * Go , go quick ! '

		he said , 4 To Jesus , to my Saviour , take My kisses and my bed . ' ''

		The child so the legend goes became , in manhood , one of the Twelve , and the poem relates it with a sim - plicity which amounts to quaintness , expressing per - fectly the mediaeval and romantic spirit of acceptance and unquestioning wonder .

		Among others , of a more moderate note , I remember Miss Sill 's '' Ere Christ , the
Flower of Virtue	ORGANIZATION	, Bloomed , '' a poem at once narrative and extremely pictorial ; a little '' Revelation , '' which shows the child of the Inn as dreaming of the child Christ out in the cold 4 ' With never a rest for his little white feet , Nor a place for his weary head , '' and , again , a beautiful '' Annunciation , '' a poem by Mrs.
Spofford	PERSON	, in which a Hebrew chant is repeated , like a thread of rich and solemn colors in some mys - tical , heaven-white garment .

		One contrasts such poems with those that preceded them things not picturesque , not especially emotional , not any with any recalling of mediseval art , but of a thoughtful character and dwelling upon the inmost spirit of the time .

		An older poem , which I think is
Whittier	LOCATION	's , tells of a certain monk who cared but little for the Christmas festivities of his convent .

		It closes : 4 ' With mask and mime And wake-song speed the holy time , But judge not him who , every morn .

		Feels in his heart the Lord Christ born . ''

		For many years our Christmas poetry was apt to be of this type , and there is much of it which still concerns itself with the last and loveliest meaning of the season ; but just now in the respect of art , if not in the respect of quantity the other type prevails .

		That it is beau - tiful , that it appeals to the tenderest of imagination , that it shows , most exquisitely , the poetic qualities of the Christmas story , is too plain for statement ; but with all this , we must turn often to the other type , the soberer type , which breathes interpretation , and which gives encouragement for the burden of the long year 's living .

		SHAKESPEARE AS A DUTY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		For something like a century , more or less , the sneer of the blunt Steevens at the Sonnets of Shake - speare has been regarded with amazement , pitying or indignant , according to the temper of the reader .

		It has been reserved for a contributor in your issue of
Nov.	DATE	.

		16 to outdo Steevens by the stark assertion that , while '' we '' read a modern novelist with delight , Shakespeare '' we '' read '' out of a sense of duty . ''

		This incentive is undoubtedly more powerful , in some respects and with some people , than `` the strongest act of Parliament ever framed , '' those , I think , were about the words of Steevens .

		We are taught that `` Morality is three-fourths of life , '' and that Duty has a freshening influence upon `` the most ancient heavens . ''

		Yet even the critic who made that arithmetical state - ment about Morality , in a more inspired moment admits `` that severe , that earnest air '' to be something more than natural .

		This contrast between
Morality and Nature	ORGANIZATION	had encouraged some of us to feel that the robin still sang , and the brook still ran down the lea , as they did when we were boys ; and that boys and men still read
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	without asking why .

		We vividly recall the time when to read him brought us in danger of the birch .

		The suggestion that in Mars or Hesper boys and men were birched for not reading
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	would have made us `` Yearn , and clasp the hands , and murmur , ` Would to God that we were there . ' ''

		With the passage of the '' years that bring the philo - sophic mind , '' we had come to recognize the existence in this world of many strange things that one does not like to think of , among the rest , that there may be people who read Shakespeare only '' on terms of base compulsion . ''

		By the way , who are these other slaves of duty whom Mr.
Stanley	PERSON	classes with himself as `` we '' ?

		If
Steevens	PERSON	were still alive , but no , the suggestion would be unworthy : of the dead we must speak only good .

		It is better to consider the plaintive `` we '' as used to veil the writer 's personal infirmity .

		`` To be a well-favored man is the gift of Fortune , but to read and write comes by Nature . ''

		As no motive short of the most exalted is sufficient to induce him to read good literature , it is idle to enquire upon what tremendous incentive he charges into the field of lit - erary criticism .

		A friend of mine who knew English literature , and had read both
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and
Scott	PERSON	through , twenty times and more , wrote at an advanced age : `` I am re-reading the whole of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	this
summer	DATE	for variety and novelty . ''

		It was of her , now gone where
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is , that I was thinking , as well as of others still in the flesh , when I permitted myself to borrow Mr.
Stanley	PERSON	's plural pronoun .

		Some of us read Balzac too , or did before it became a cult , and , therefore , of course , a duty .

		In fact , with
Taine	PERSON	, we like pretty much '' everything that is literature , '' and we wish that people would not contrive to make it a bore .

		J THE DIAL 489 A CRITIC CRITICIZED .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In '' Scribner 's Magazine , '' some months ago , there appeared a criticism of Balzac by Professor
George McLean Harper	PERSON	.

		According to this critic only the following of
Balzac	LOCATION	's novels and stories are `` indubita - ble , illustrious successes '' : Novels . '

		Enge ` nie Grandet . ''

		` Ce ` sar Birotteau . '' '

		Le Curg He Tours . '' '

		Le Pere Goriot . '' '

		La Femme de Trente Ans . ''

		` Uu De ` but dans la Vie . ''

		4 La Rabonilleiifle . '' '

		Le Colonel Chabert . ''

		4 L' Envers de 1 ' Histoire Contemporaine . ''

		` Un Episode sous la Ter - reur . ''

		1 LeChef-d'CEuvre Inconnu . ''

		` El Verdugo . ''

		1 La Messe de 1 ' Ath5e . ''

		1 L' Auberge Rouge . '' '

		Le Re `` quisitionnaire . ''

		VUn Drame au Bord de la Mer . '' ''

		No other French writer , '' says Mr.
Harper	PERSON	, '' per - haps 110 two or three of them together , can offer so long a list of splendid novels .

		It contains more vigor - ous intellectual substance than all the rest of French fiction put together .

		In these pages live two or three score men and women endowed with distinct individu - ality and at the same time standing as types of the race .

		A sense of awe overcomes us , as in the presence of an irresistible power , for through all these books quivers the mighty will of their creator , in painful effort , in exalted earnestness , compelling where it can - not charm . ''

		On the other hand , about one-half of Balzac 's nov - els are , according to this critic , spoiled by '' the mob of fashionable libertines , police spies , sentimentally de - bauched duchesses and countesses , rich and marvellously beautiful actresses and courtesans , of shady bankers , picturesque usurers , bohemian actors , idle and diaboli - cally clever journalists

		... Some of his novels must be accounted entire fail - ures because in them these figures whom he dotes on predominate . ''

		In criticising Bilzac it has seemed to the writer that certain difficulties are to be encountered , some of which Mr.
Harper	PERSON	does not appear to have entirely overcome .

		What is to be understood by the broad terms '' success '' and '' failure '' as applied to a novel ?

		Conformity to every essential rule of realism , with at the same time opportunity given the reader to choose more refined , or more remarkable , or more lively com - pany than life generally offers to any one of us , is evi - dently Mr.
Harper	PERSON	's idea of what a novel must possess in order to be an `` indubitable , illustrious success . '' ''

		We look to literature , '' he says '' for something more interesting , nay , for something more elevated , than common events and common talk . ''

		Keeping this definition in mind , and applying it to the list of '' splen - did novels '' mentioned at the beginning of this com - munication , it is difficult to see what more refined , more remarkable , or more lively company '' there is for the reader in '' Enge'uie Grandet , '' '' Ce ` sar Birotteau , '' or Pere Goriot , '' for example , or what there is in them more elevated thau common events and common talk . ''

		To be sure we find in every one of these books a noble and unselfish character , but he invariably gets the worst of it , so that the three novels , though not degrading , are certainly depressing , and a successful novel , as we understand Mr.
Harper	PERSON	to put it , should not be depressing .

		Again , it can hardly be said that in ''
Pere Goriot	PERSON	, '' for example , '' the mob of fashionable libertines , police spies , etc. , '' play a subordinate part .

		If these people , '' mere caricatures of reality , as improb - able as they are depressing , not to say degrading , '' were taken out of Pere Goriot , '' what would be left ?

		Nothing is more common than to criticise Balzac for the improbability of his characters , but to an experi - enced professional man practicing in a large city , almost nothing in his fiction seems improbable . ''

		The mob of fashionable libertines , etc. , '' while perhaps de - pressing , are , in the writer 's opinion , not so improbable as many well-accredited and accepted saints iu other fiction .

		The triumph of virtue with the concomitant downfall of vice sells well when pleasingly narrated , and is no doubt vastly consoling and elevating to the mind of the '' average reader , '' but is it the truth and the whole truth about life ?

		And do books manufac - tured by this same old machinery really preach the sermon against injustice , tyranny , oppression , worldli - ness , and selfishness which masters like
Thackeray	PERSON	and Balzac ring out from their pulpits ?

		To the writer 's mind , one principal reason why Balzac is great is be - cause he is not blind .

		He pays absolutely no attention to what the selfishly-contented like to think prevails , but gives us instead a candid and accurately related story dressed in the garb of entertaining fiction , of what some of us know to be the truth .

		Possibly it is not the most conspicuous truth in Thrums op in
Cranford	LOCATION	, but it is that which is all too evident to any observant professional man in
Paris	LOCATION	, in
London	LOCATION	, or in
New York	LOCATION	.

		Objection to some of
Balzac	ORGANIZATION	's books is made by Mr.
Harper	PERSON	on the ground that they are '' profoundfy im - moral . ''

		Such an objection deserves serious considera - tion at a time when immoral plays and books are a source of rich profit to those who are debauching litera - ture and the stage .

		But according to Mr.
Harper	PERSON	'' Balzac is never easy reading , '' arid if this is the case do his books attract the sensual ?

		And if they do not attract the sensual can they really be called immoral ?

		Lastly , Mr.
Harper	PERSON	thinks the addiction to money , so evident throughout
Balzac	LOCATION	's books , '' a grave defect . '' ''

		Money , '' he says , '' with ignoble ways of earning , hoarding , and spending money , is the very substance of
Balzac	LOCATION	's books . ''

		But it must be admitted that money , with ignoble ways of earning , hoarding , and spending , is the very substance of life to an immense majority of the people of the world , and the care of money to all the rest .

		The social historian who would fail to make money the foundation on which his story of life is built resembles the anatomist who would exclude the skeleton from his treatise .

		Balzac was the priest to whom all humanity confessed .

		In spite of Mr.
Harper	PERSON	's refined , cultivated , and appre - ciative criticism , I incline to the opinion that the critic of the great French novelist is not yet born .

		We are , of course , at liberty to express our opinion of his books , but always from a hopelessly individual point of view , and with the inevitable result that each one of us betrays to someone else his own comparative inexpe - rience -

		HOWELLS 'S MEMORIES .

		* Enjoyable is the inevitable word for Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's new book , and we have no fault what - ever to find with it save that it lacks an Index , and that it leaves the reader , like
Oliver Twist	PERSON	, asking for more .

		Candor is its key-note .

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	is charmingly frank about himself , and is frank , to a degree that would be disas - trous in a less sweet-tempered memoirist , about others .

		Therefore , as we read his book we are warmed with a sense of being taken to a flattering extent into his confidence .

		Most readers , we fancy , figure Mr.
Howells	PERSON	mainly as a writer in fiction -LRB- if that be the word -RRB- of the ''
Silas Lapham	PERSON	'' genre , and as the some - what impatient critic of writers in that other genre , who regard fiction as the natural and legitimate field for drawing the long bow ; and for such readers there are some little surprises in the present volume .

		For example , Mr.
Howells	PERSON	opens his retrospect with the admis - sion that he began life as poet -LRB- by aspiration , at least -RRB- , and that he tried to be , in those sanguine days , as much as possible like
Heine	PERSON	that Romantique defroque .

		`` Inwardly , '' he says , ' I was a poet , with no wish to be anything else , unless in a moment of care - less affluence I might so far forget myself as to be a novelist . ''

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, moreover , began life a pronounced hero - worshipper the hero as man-of-letters being , of course , the divinity he most affected .


Bayard Taylor	PERSON	, then lecturing in the West , was the first hero in that order that Mr.
Howells	PERSON	met in the flesh , and the contact almost paralyzed him . ''

		Heaven knows , '' he says , '' how I got through the evening . ''

		At all events he sat through it rapt and speechless , watching the bard drink his beer and smoke his pipe , and hearing him discourse of quite sublunary things . ''

		I longed , '' says Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, '' to tell him how much I liked his poems , which we used to get by heart in those days , and I longed -LRB- how much more I longed ! -RRB-

		to have him know that '
Auch	PERSON	ich war in Arkadien geboren ' '' But he did n't dare to , and so Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	left
Columbus	LOCATION	all unconscious of the homage of which he had been the object .

		We must add * LITERARY FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCE .

		A
Personal Retrospect of American Authorship	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
\ V. D. Howells	PERSON	.

		Illustrated .

		New Yotk :
Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	.

		here parenthetically that the picture facing the account of the
Taylor	PERSON	episode seems rather at variance with it , since it shows Mr.
How	PERSON	- ells , not as a meek and reverent votary , but as a particularly alert and resolute looking re - porter , who , with pencil and note-book , is clearly applying the screws to Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	in a way that causes him to mop his brow in agony .

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	had already printed poems in the `` Atlantic Monthly '' and in the ''
Saturday	DATE	Press , '' of
New York	LOCATION	, when he started for
Boston	LOCATION	, then in its Augustan age , to see the real
Olympians Lowell	PERSON	,
Hawthorne	LOCATION	,
Holmes	PERSON	,
Emerson	LOCATION	, and the rest , and for
New York	LOCATION	to see , as he fondly fancied , the real bohemians now no matter whom .

		Bohemia -LRB- or
Boaotia	LOCATION	, as the Olympians thought -RRB- was then poking its beer-cellar fun at the
Athens	LOCATION	to the north of it , and Mr.
Howells	PERSON	expected profit and pleasure from studying the contrasts .

		One of the first of the
New England	LOCATION	literati upon whom he called was
Lowell	PERSON	, and to him many cordial and delightful pages are devoted .

		Of all Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's long and shining list of '' lit - erary friends '' it is
Lowell	LOCATION	, we fancy , who is to be rated his real dulce decus .

		He was then forty-one , or Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's senior by nineteen years . ''

		At the first encounter with people he always was apt to have a certain frosty shyness , a smiling cold , as from the long , high-sunned winters of his Puritan race ; he was not quite himself till he had made you aware of his quality : then no one could be sweeter , tenderer , warmer than he ; then he made you free of his whole heart ; but you must be his captive before he could do that . ''

		Turning the page to a later reference to
Lowell	LOCATION	, near the end of the volume , we find some veiled or indirect allusion to the notion rife after his last return from
England	LOCATION	that his long stay abroad had made him '' un-Amer - ican . ''

		Most of us remember the absurd way in which the press , or a certain section of it , assailed
Lowell	LOCATION	on this grave charge ; how his
London	LOCATION	clothes and
London	LOCATION	ways were made a reproach to him ; how it was said that he went about the country lecturing on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	when it was his patriotic duty to make political speeches ; how he was accused of trimming his opinions -LRB- and his whiskers -RRB- to the mode of what Mr.
Guppy	PERSON	used to call '' the swan-like aristocracy '' and what not .

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	says that
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	could never have been any - thing but American , if he had tried ; but , he adds , '' he certainly did not return to the out - ward simplicities of his life as I first knew it . ''

		1900 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 491 '' There was no more round-hat-and - sack-coat busi - ness for him ; he wore a frock and a high hat , and whatever else was rather like
London	LOCATION	than
Cambridge	LOCATION	; I do not know but drab gaiters sometimes added to the effect of a gentleman of the old school which he now produced upon the witness .

		Some fastidiousnesses showed themselves in him , which were not so surpris - ing .

		He complained of the American lower-class man - ner ; the conductor and cabman would be kind to you , but they would not be respectful , and he could not see the fun of this in the old way . ''

		Reverting to Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's account of his first visit to
New England	LOCATION	, the eye is arrested by the following impressive portrait of
Hawthorne	LOCATION	, upon whom the author called with a generously worded letter of introduction from
Lowell	LOCATION	. ''

		... He advanced carrying his head with a heavy forward droop , and with a pace for which I decided that the word would be pondering .

		It was the pace of a bulky man of fifty , and his head was that beautiful head we all know from the many pictures of it .

		But
Hawthorne	PERSON	's look was different from that of any picture of him that I have seen .

		It was sombre and brooding , as the look of such a poet should have been ; it was the look of a man who had dealt faithfully and there - fore sorrowfully with that problem of evil which for - ever attracted , forever evaded ,
Hawthorne	LOCATION	.

		It was by no means troubled ; it was full of a dark repose . ''

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's reception , though a thought * ' shy and tentative , '' was nevertheless warm enough to be encouraging , and in the conver - sation that ensued he got on charmingly with his usually distant and elusive host .

		The talk turned on many men and things on
Lowell	LOCATION	, on
Holmes	ORGANIZATION	, on German poetry , on the West -LRB- about which
Hawthorne	PERSON	was curious , saying he wanted to see some part of the country on which the '' damned shadow '' of
Europe	LOCATION	had not fallen -RRB- , on
Emerson	LOCATION	, on
Thoreau	LOCATION	, of whom he observed that he ,
Thoreau	PERSON	, '' prided himself on coming nearer to the heart of a pine-tree than any other human being '' ; and
Hawthorne	PERSON	was visibly pleased when his young visitor rejoined , '' I would rather come near the heart of a man . ''

		Not ill pleased was he , Mr.
Howells	PERSON	adds , '' when he asked whether I was not going to see his next neighbor , Mr.
Alcott	PERSON	, and I confessed that I had never heard of him . ''

		On parting , Mr.
Howells	PERSON	received from his now friendly entertainer a note of intro - duction to
Emerson	LOCATION	, in the form of a card with the quaint endorsement : '' I find this young man worthy . ''

		That was glory enough for one day .

		Next morning Mr.
Howells	PERSON	hunted up or hunted down Thoreau . ''

		... He came into the room a quaint , stump figure of a man , whose effect of long trunk and short limbs was heightened by his fashionless trousers being let down too low .

		He had a noble face , with tossed hair , a distraught eye , and a fine acquilinity of profile , which made me think at once of
Don Quixote	PERSON	and
Cervantes	PERSON	; but his nose failed to add that foot to his stature which
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	says a nose of that shape will always give a man .

		He tried to place me geographically , after he had given me a chair not quite so far off as
Ohio	LOCATION	, though still across the whole room , for he sat against one wall , and I against the other ; but apparently he failed to pull himself out of his revery by the effort , for he remained in a dreamy muse , which all my attempts to say some - thing fit about
John Brown	PERSON	and
Walden Pond	ORGANIZATION	seemed only to deepen upon him . ''

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	admits that his encounter with
Thoreau	PERSON	was a rout ; and that with
Emerson	PERSON	, it seems , was not much better .

		The talk with the latter appears to have been somewhat forced and indefinite ; but in the course of it , at any rate , the seraphic man found occasion to kindly dismiss
Hawthorne	PERSON	's last book -LRB- the '' Marble Faun '' -RRB- as '' mere mush , '' and to dispose of
Poe	PERSON	as the '' jingle man '' !

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's con - tributions to the '' Atlantic Monthly ''
Emerson	PERSON	had evidently not read , for , when they were mentioned , he got down a bound volume of the magazine , inspected the pieces with an air of seeing something very new indeed , and then gravely affixed the author 's initials to each , with as much apparent emotion , we judge , as he might have shown in docketing a wash-bill .

		This ceremony ended ,
Emerson	PERSON	followed his leave-taking visitor to the door , still talking of poetry , to which -LRB- he added , as a parting crusher -RRB- '' one might very well give a pleasant hour now and then . ''

		This finished Mr.
How	PERSON	- ells for the day . ''

		I went home to my hotel , '' he says , '' and passed the afternoon in pure misery . ''

		He was at first at a loss to account for his seeming failure with
Emerson	PERSON	, but at last hit upon the fact that , as he says , in his confused retreat from the philosopher 's pres - ence , he had neglected some slight point of ceremony .

		On his return to
Boston	LOCATION	he related the story to Mr. Fields . ''

		By this time I could see it in a humorous light , and I did not much mind his lying back in his chair and laughing and laughing , till I thought he would roll out of it .

		He perfectly conceived the situation , and got an amusement from it that I could get only through sym - pathy with him . ''

		From
Boston	LOCATION	Mr.
Howells	PERSON	proceeded to
New York	LOCATION	to see
Bohemia	LOCATION	.

		He found it , we gather , to his disappointment , a great many shades less black , that is less naughty , than his eager fancy had painted it found it , in fact , a rather cheap and plainly sham
Bohemia	LOCATION	, as like the real
Paris	LOCATION	article as
Tupper	PERSON	is like
Verlaine	PERSON	, and peopled largely by young press - writers still in the
Flegeljahre	LOCATION	, who pretended 492 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, to live in sin and contempt of the Decalogue , and were , in their souls , as innocent as Mr.
Toots	PERSON	.

		The whole thing , in short , was a pose like the sporting bent of
Nathaniel Winkle	PERSON	.

		It was the custom of the '' bohemians '' to hold their -LRB- not very alarming -RRB- revels at
Pfaff	PERSON	's , a beer-cellar up Broadway ; and there they paid mild , though ostentatious , court to Gam - brinus , railed at respectability and
Boston	LOCATION	, and were very fierce about all literary shams but their own .

		Let us turn to Mr.
Howells	PERSON	for an account of an '' orgy '' at
Pfaff	PERSON	's : '' I felt that as a contributor -LRB- to the '
Saturday	DATE	Press ' -RRB- and at least a brevet bohemiari , I ought not to go home without visiting the famous place , and wit - nessing , if I could not share , the revels of my comrades .

		As I neither drank beer nor smoked , my part in the carousal was limited to a German pancake , which I found they had very good at
Pfaff	PERSON	's , and to listening to the whirling words of my commensals , at the long board spread for the bohemians in a cavernous space under the pavement .

		... At one moment of the orgy , which went but slowly for an orgy , we were joined by some belated bohemiaus whom the others made a great clamor over ; I was given to understand they were just recovered from a fearful debauch ; their locks were still damp from the wet towels used to restore them , and their eyes were very frenzied .

		I was pre - sented to these types , who neither said nor did any - thing worthy of their awful appearance , but dropped into seats at the table , and ate of the supper with an appetite that seemed poor .

		I stayed hoping vainly for worse things till eleven o'clock , and then I rose and took my leave of a literary condition that had dis - tinctly disappointed me . ''

		We have , in the foregoing extracts , barely scratched the surface of Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's racy and pleasantly written book , which , be it said , will be prized not only as a rich repository of literary anecdote and portraiture , but for its autobiographical value , and , last but not least , for its vein of criticism .

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's frank though loving appreciations of the work of his friends ,
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Longfellow	LOCATION	,
Holmes	PERSON	,
Haw	PERSON	- thorne ,
Bayard Taylor	PERSON	, Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	,
Celia Thaxter	PERSON	, etc. , form an element of much inter - est. .

		Very pleasant reading indeed is the closing chapter on ''
Cambridge Neighbors	ORGANIZATION	, '' and right welcome to all true and thoughtful Americans should be its final tribute to one they delight to honor : '' I am sure that after the easy heroes of the day are long forgot , and the noisy fames of the strenuous life shall dwindle to their essential insignificance before these of the gentle life , we shall all see in
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	the eminent scholar who left the quiet of his books to become our chief citizen at the moment when he warned his countrymen of the ignominy and disaster of doing wrong . ''

		E. G. J. Two AMERICAN STUDENTS OF S II AKKSPK AK E. * When one recollects some of the fatuities that have been foisted upon the world in the name of Shakespearean criticism , one derives a certain solace from the lesson in practical philosophy taught by Scapin to his old master ,
Argante	ORGANIZATION	.

		Whenever , counsels
Scapin	PERSON	, the father of a family is returning home , let him run over in his mind all the dreadful things that might have happened in his absence , '' let him imagine his house in ashes , his money stolen , his wife dead , his son maimed , his daughter betrayed . ''

		Then he will be able to regard the non-occurrence of any one of these calamities as so much clear gain .

		Things have come to such a pass that there is but too good reason to look forward to a new book about Shakespeare with '' horrible imaginings '' almost equal to those with which the philo - sophical valet affects to comfort the perturbed old gentleman .

		So it is with a tremor of relief that the critical Argante notes first in Mr.
Mabie	PERSON	's new book on
William Shakespeare	PERSON	the things that are not done .

		To begin with , Mr.
Mabie	PERSON	actually seems to think that '' Mr.
William Himself	PERSON	'' is the divine
Williams	PERSON	.

		To think otherwise would have been much more `` original , '' and might have promoted the sale of his book .

		Mr.
Mabie	PERSON	's chief originality as a biographer of Shakespeare lies in the fact that he does not try to invent or imagine any - thing new .

		The best compliment I can pay him is to apply to him the fine quotation he makes from Goethe : '' To say a thing that everybody has said before as quietly as if nobody had ever said it , that is originality . ''

		His book has something of this quiet style , '' the harvest of a quiet eye . ''

		It has the dignity of repose .

		Nor is this all : two positive quali - ties appear , sanity and catholicity .

		Sanity is shown in the author 's choice of things to say , and quite as much in what he refrains from saying or suggesting .

		Catholicity is shown in his wide taste and in the largeness of his moral judgments .

		It would have been so easy for a writer having in view the audience to which , I believe , these chapters were first addressed , to '' deplore '' certain features of *

		THE DIAL 493 the work of this world 's poet .

		It might have been acceptable to many had Mr.
Mabie	PERSON	apologized for Shakespeare because he wrote no hymns like those of Dr.
Watts	PERSON	.

		But Mr.
Mabie	PERSON	neither deplores nor apologizes .

		In sanity , and in what may be termed liter - ary integrity , Mr.
Mabie	PERSON	presents a welcome contrast to Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	, who is prone to put theory in the place of fact and to offer conjec - ture for proof .

		The American writer has , to be sure , a much smaller amount of material to deal with , the scope of his book being nar - rower .

		One can only say that , within the limits which he sets himself , he shows on the whole a surer command of his subject than did the Danish critic .

		All this is high praise : so high that some - one may enquire whether we have here at last a book about the world 's greatest author which is worthy of the subject .

		Well , not quite !

		It is not , for instance , such a book as Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	might have written had his great lit - erary energy and charm been supported by adequate scholarship and by sanity of judg - ment .

		For the task of writing anything like a decisive book , Mr.
Mabie	PERSON	has given no sign of possessing the requisite force .

		A remark of Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	about
Addison	PERSON	may be applied , with more justice , to the author of the book before us : '' He thinks justly , but he thinks faintly . ''

		Mr.
Mabie	PERSON	pays the penalty of the habit of religious journalism .

		He writes too easily ; he slides with fatal facility into abstrac - tions .

		Precisely in those passages of large generalization where he should be especially definite and cogent , he becomes diffuse and vaporous . ''

		Glittering generalities '' are bad enough , but Mr.
Mabie	PERSON	's do not even glitter .

		He exhibits at times a tendency to the pro- cessional style : grandiose generalizations at - tended by a pompous verbal retinue .

		He wrote , one fancies , having in view an audience that is fond of phrases `` divinely relishing , '' an audience that would warmly applaud the obiter dictum of Mr. Justice Shallow : '' Good phrases are surely , and ever were , very com - mendable . ''

		It is amusing to contrast this writer 's long-tailed words with the simpler vocabulary of the author he treats of .

		Of course a writer of the present time can not be expected to restrict himself to the vocabu - lary of any former period .

		Still , it is instruc - tive to note how freely and pregnantly our ancestors managed to discourse without the use of modernisms , such , for example , as '' de - velopment , '' '' environment , '' and a thousand others which too frequently do duty rather as counters than as the coin of thought .

		A favorite word with this writer is the word '' spiritual . ''

		Thus he remarks that '' the spiritual motive '' of what he calls '' the sonnet - sequence '' is suggested in Sonnet 144 .

		This statement , by the way , as Mr.
Sidney Lee	PERSON	has decisively shown , is susceptible neither of proof nor of rational justification .

		But quite apart from that , one is puzzled to detect any - thing especially '' spiritual '' either in the `` mo - tive '' or the implications of this sonnet .

		Here and often the word in question is a manner - ism .

		Now
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	uses the word only six times , and then rather as opposed to lay or temporal than in the sense which this writer commonly gives it .

		Perhaps this may be partly accounted for by Mr.
Mabie	PERSON	's rather sweeping statement that '' Into the region of pure spiritual impulse and ultimate spiritual relationship
Shakespeare	PERSON	did not penetrate . ''

		To which it may be respectfully submitted that the region thus described , although laid down on no map , is one concerning which
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	may possibly have reflected as much as some of those who talk more .

		He certainly is not of those who '' prophesied in Thy Name ! ''

		At all events , his example in saying little of subjects whereof he knew nothing is not a bad one for those writers who are so rich in sonorous phrases ingen - iously devised , like big bottles with small bellies , to dissimulate the paucity of their contents .

		The weakest chapter is perhaps the one de - voted to the sonnets .

		Plainly Mr.
Mabie	PERSON	has never been possessed with a passion for these wondrous lyrics .

		He finds '' a note of reality '' distinctly sounded in what he assumes to be `` the series . ''

		His argument based upon this '' note of reality '' is self - contradictory -LRB- p. 219 -RRB- .

		He forgets that the artist who endows his im - aginary creatures , Hamlet and Prospero , with such convincing reality , would have been quite equal to the creation , if creation it be , of such figures as the friend and '' the woman colored ill . ''

		But I forbear further strictures .

		Shakespeare 's literary executors , as one may venture to term
Masters Heminge	ORGANIZATION	and
Condell	PERSON	, prefaced the Folio edition of the plays with an address '' To the great Variety of Readers . ''

		To this they added , with a prescience that to us seems wonderful , the words : '' from the most able to him that can but spell . ''

		It is of course not for '' the most able '' that the book before us is written .

		For the other , larger 494 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, class , including possibly even some whose ability to spell is questionable , Mr.
Mabie	PERSON	has provided a comprehensive , sober , and enlightening account of the life-work of the master-spirit of the English-speaking race .

		Such defects of manner and matter as I have referred to by no means vitiate the book .

		When the writer is content to tell a plain tale plainly he is attractive , sometimes charming .

		Had he succeeded in interpreting the magic of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's art as he does that of the War - wickshire countryside , he would have produced not only a good but perhaps a great book .

		That descriptive chapter is as fine in its way as the exemplary treatment of the same subject by the late Mr.
Spencer Baynes	PERSON	.

		On the whole , the book was worth writing , and may be said to merit the popularity which it is likely to enjoy .

		Some of the portraits are of contemporaries who stood in no known relation to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, but many of the illustrations are extremely well chosen and are not easily accessible elsewhere .

		Particularly interesting are the reproductions of old pictures of Lon - don , of old
London	LOCATION	Bridge , of the Bankside , and the like . ''

		I am not only witty myself , '' said Fallstaff , '' but the cause that wit is in other men . ''

		Were
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	condemned to read in Pur - gatory all the commentaries upon his works , it is to be doubted whether he would have the heart to repeat the boast of Fallstaff .

		Were he , however , sentenced to read only those com - ments that have been admitted into Dr. Fur - ness 's Variorum edition of '' Much Ado About Nothing , '' he might well regard the sentence as light .

		A recent correspondent of THE DIAL remarks , with gravity worthy of
Dogberry	ORGANIZATION	, that '' we '' read Shakespeare '' out of a sense of duty . ''

		The '' glad hearts '' who , as the poet of Duty concedes , may deem '' joy its own security , '' can not fail to be gratified , though perhaps a little surprised , to find that the sweetest of their stolen pleasures has so lofty a sanction .

		Some of us have from early youth , it appears , been doing our Duty unawares , as
M. Jourdain	PERSON	talked prose .

		And it is in the same spirit that we others -LRB- if the gallicism may be pardoned -RRB- perform the duty of reading the notes culled and presented by Dr.
Furness	PERSON	.

		Next to the text , nothing can be more amusing than the comment .

		Dr.
Furness	PERSON	invites a goodly company to a wedding breakfast in honor of
Benedick	ORGANIZATION	and
Beatrice	PERSON	.

		Wit is there in the person of Christopher North ; Beauty in the person of
Helen Faucet	PERSON	; nor is the lady 's endowment of wit the less liberal , any more than in the case of Beatrice herself .

		All the guests are at their best , and none speaks more delightfully than does the urbane master of the feast .

		Without going into details that would be out of place here , there is , in a general way , not much to be said of this monumental edition of `` Much Ado '' that has not been said of the preceding volumes of this priceless series .

		The set now comprises eleven plays -LRB- in twelve vol - umes -RRB- , and constitutes , with respect to these plays , a
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	library of the selectest quality .

		The present volume bears marks everywhere of the same amazing industry , un - assuming erudition , sure taste , and racy humor , that have distinguished the others .

		The editor 's interpretation is both subtle and sympathetic ; his humor is always good humor .

		It would be a liberal education to be snowed in with these volumes throughout '' a
Poland	LOCATION	winter , '' nor would the time hang heavy .

		The best is that the editor so far overcomes his modest scruples as to give us more and more of himself .

		The charm of his personality seems to pervade the notes much as the magic of the master per - vades the text .

		Where no living scholar could equal Dr.
Furness	PERSON	, he manages to improve upon himself .

		Whatever others may do , the publication of one of his volumes has come to be , whenever it occurs , the event of the year in this field .

		May the great editor be spared to double and treble the dozen he has completed !

		Every student of the poet should treat him - self to the luxury of the book at this
Christmas	DATE	- tide , and should begin his pleasure by reading that page of the Preface devoted to an enume - ration of the deeds imputed to the poet during the seven silent years concerning which there is no recorded syllable .

		I will forestall no one 's delight -LRB- or duty ! -RRB-

		by quoting anything but the concluding sally : '' My own private conviction is that he mastered cuneiform ; visited
America	LOCATION	; and remained quite a while here , greatly to his intellectual advantage . ''

		Here are two suggestions for doctoral theses .

		Nothing , I may add , is more creditable to Mr.
Mabie	PERSON	than the judgment with which he has kept clear of these bogs , '' where armies whole have sunk , '' upon the obscure shores of which Dr.
Furness	PERSON	now places this bright danger-signal .

		THE DIAL 495 THE PAGEANTRY OF IJIFE .

		* With the advent of democracy the things of which Mr.
Charles Whibley	PERSON	writes in '' The Pageantry of Life '' have become in a degree matters of commonplace .

		Splendor , courtesy , the artistic graces and refinements of life , have come nearer to man in the mass and have so lost some of their glamor but those to whom circumstance makes them increasingly access - ible are yet largely open to the charge of
Phil	PERSON	- istinism ; they are still in a measure '' insen - sible to the finer flavors of life . ''

		But this can not be said of '' Young Weston '' or Bas - sompierre or Sir
Kenelm Digby	PERSON	or Pepys or Saint
Simon	PERSON	or
Barbey d'Aurevilly	ORGANIZATION	, as Mr.
Whibley	PERSON	insists in his brilliant portraits of them .

		They , and a number of others who are made familiar to us in these pages , are here given such vitality of life , with its glow and color , because of the author 's enthusiasm for them as artists in life .

		But in such matters the point of view is of fundamental importance .

		Towards the suc - cessful consummation of what purposes should effort be directed that a life may be said at its close to have been artistically ordered ?

		To the full enjoyment of all the finer flavors of life , our author would say , and we might accept this but that , in his interpretation , these finer flavors smack so much of the material as to verge upon grossness .

		Perhaps
Lowell	PERSON	's charge that
Pepys	PERSON	was a Philistine betrays some nar - rowness of sympathies .

		The Puritan strain kept
Lowell	PERSON	, as it kept
Emerson	PERSON	and Haw - thorne and their fellows , from appreciation of some of the finer flavors of life , no doubt .

		But on the other hand
Lowell	PERSON	quite as certainly knew pleasures in life finer and higher than any that came to
Pepys	PERSON	, and may not one be a
Philistine	LOCATION	through being insensible to the vul - garities of life , also ? ''

		What then makes the artist , whose portrait is here attempted ?

		It is not profession , nor birth , nor man - ners , nor knowledge , nor success , though all these are invaluable accessories .

		It is temperament , it is life .

		The priest need not lag behind the courtier .

		Whoever had a finer sense of grandeur than
Wolsey	LOCATION	?

		and was not
Pascal	PERSON	famous for his six horses ?

		Nor need pov - erty disturb a skilful exercise of the art .


Burns	PERSON	had a glimpse into its possibilities when he sported the only tie wig in the parish , and the simple propriety of a graceful dinner is beyond the pocket of no man who can afford clean linen and a cheese .

		Again , the coat depends for its effect less upon the reckless use of vel - vet or satin than upon the bravery wherewith it is worn .

		But an inapposite assumption of birth , a clumsy * THE PAGEANTRY OF LIFE .

Charles Whibley	PERSON	.

		show of riches , are the worst foes of elegance : without the true temperament the resources of
Golconda	LOCATION	will avail nothing .

		When
Byron	PERSON	said he would rather be
Brummel	PERSON	than
Napoleon	PERSON	, he did not merely pay a de - served tribute to the genius of dandyism ; he acknow - ledged that the Dandy was distinguished by rarer qual - ities than those which achieve the conquest of the world .

		Yet
Brummel	PERSON	could dazzle his rivals neither by exalted birth nor by lavish display .

		He was gifted with nothing save the sublime talent of his craft , and he triumphed . ''

		This is from the Introduction , and in a pre - ceding paragraph he has said of the artist in life : '' It is no part of his design to be a good citizen .

		... He neither controls governments nor wins bat - tles .

		He despises the glory which follows a popular triumph , and he professes no greater interest iu the secrets of philosophy than is becoming to a person of wit .

		Nor is he a shining example of the homely vir - tues ; with him a sense of the picturesque is more vivid than the sense of morality . ''

		But the perfect artist is neglectful of no least detail in the setting of his picture .

		Back - ground and atmosphere are matters of first moment , and the central creation of the can - vas can not be given form and color without regard to the harmony of the whole .

		In art there is no greater sin than that of putting together things that are discordant .

		Quite clearly an artist in life , as distinguished from a
Philistine	LOCATION	, is one in whom artistic sen - sitiveness is alive to all that can give pleasure of the higher sort , and alive no less to all that can offend a refined taste .

		Mr.
Whibley	PERSON	does not see this quite clearly , and as a conse - quence throughout the volume the emphasis is often wrongly placed .

		Otherwise the book revives with delightful vividness some very interesting personalities .

		They are sketched with a grace and a sympathetic sureness of detail that make the portraits clearly outlined realities .

		And if , as in the case of the author of `` Vathek , '' our interest in them is due to something unnatural and fantastic , it is , at least , not due to commonplace .

		Individuality , bravery , gaiety , and devotion to ideals are warm and vital on every page .

		We hear the clank of sword , the witty sally and the laugh that follows , the whisper of intrigue ; we see the life and movement and ceremony of courts , the smile and the obeisance of elegance and fashion ; and always in camp or court or con - vivial meeting we are shown a figure moving with graceful stateliness through the pageantry of life , and finding in it occasion for amuse - ment , for unfailing gaiety , for studious obser - vation , and at times for the artist 's unfeigned and undisguised contempt .

Dec. 16	DATE	, RECENT FrcTioN .

		* The novels of Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	are always characterized by an element of interest that lies far apart from the actual needs of fiction .

		With all her power of telling an interesting story , she is never content unless she interests us as well in some great theme of the intellectual life or of the historical social movement .

		In ''
Robert Elsmere	PERSON	'' this theme was the solution of traditional religious beliefs by the medium of the higher criticism ; in ''
Marcella	PERSON	'' it was the English socialist propaganda , in ''
Hel	PERSON	- beck of Bannisdale '' it was the contrast between the ideals of Catholic and Protestant , and in `` Eleanor '' it is the struggle between conservative and radical forces in the life of modern
Italy	LOCATION	.

		An interest in
Italy	LOCATION	is in itself a passport to the favor of readers of refinement , and Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	knows her
Italy	LOCATION	both without and within , knows it in its physical charm and its historical significance , knows it also in its political struggles and its clash of irreconcilable spiritual forces contending for the mastery .

		Her method , moreover , is one of such absolute fairness that it would be difficult from the book alone for a reader of '' Eleanor '' to be sure of the direction of the writer 's personal sympathies .

		One could hardly get from the most partisan defender of the old regime a more vivid impression of
Catholic Italy	LOCATION	, of its pomp and pageantry , of its seductive appeal to the deeper emotions , of the great historical tra - dition which it embodies , than one can get from this book written by a woman who resolutely rejects the supernatural , and stands abreast of the most enlightened modern scholarship and philosophy .

		Mrs -
Ward	PERSON	has in a very rare degree the power of appealing to the religious sentiment without imply - ing the necessity for the acceptance of any form of religious dogma ; she makes us understand better than most writers how entirely religion , in its true sense , is an affair of the emotions rather than of the intellect .

		Beside these great issues , which are every - where at the front in her pages , the private interest attaching to her characters seems si ight .

		They are all skilfully studied , delineated with delicate touches , and brought into relations with one another that reveal the inmost springs of their life ; yet all this personal human interest , genuine as it is , seems overshadowed by the vaster interests of society which are kept before the mind .

		We take almost as much interest in the book about modern
Italy	LOCATION	upon which the hero is engaged as we take in the gradual awakening of his love for the heroine , or rather in the gradual transfer of his affections from one heroine to the other , since it would be difficult to say which of the two women concerned should be taken as the more important character in the development of the novel .

		Certainly , the book must be given a high place among our latest works of fiction , although in some respects it falls short of displaying the artistic power of ``
David Grieve	PERSON	'' and ''
Robert Elsmere	PERSON	. ''

		We are inclined to say that it is with Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	as it was with the only woman writer of fiction with whom she may be compared , to say , in short , that there is a decline of creative power in her works not unlike that exhib - ited in the transition from ''
Adam Bede	PERSON	'' to ''
Daniel Deronda	PERSON	, '' and that this decline is not altogether compensated for by the richer display of intellectual force that is made in the later , and in many ways riper , productions .

		Mrs.
Steel	PERSON	has once again shown her capacity to outdo Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	as a delineator of modern
India	LOCATION	.

		for even Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's brilliant sketches of the great Empire of the East display no deeper insight , and have much less of solid workmanship , than such books as '' On the Face of the Waters '' and its worthy companion volume , '' The Hosts of the Lord , '' just now published .

		Mrs.
Steel	PERSON	's novels of
India	LOCATION	have one great fault , they are elliptical in construction , and it takes a considerable mental effort to understand how her characters are adjusted to their environment .

		Her own vision is clear enough , but she does not know how to impart it to others .

		But this fault is more than outweighed by the remarkable positive merits of her work . ''

		The Hosts of the Lord '' has a theme only less dramatic than that of the
Great Mutiny	LOCATION	, although it deals with a native uprising of restricted scope and of no far-reaching historical significance .

		But it has the same essential elements of interest , and its success in the portrayal of native types and modes of think - ing is complete .

		Of almost equal interest are the English men and women who figure in the narra - tive , and , with the one exception already noted , we have only praise for this remarkable piece of fiction .

		1900 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 497 ''
Robert Orange	ORGANIZATION	'' shares the fate of most sequels in being less interesting than '' The School for Saints . ''

		It has no Spanish war for dramatic effect ; it has no romantic dawn of love for sympathetic appeal .

		It offers , in the main , the working out of motives that wore off their freshness in the earlier volume , and it ends in a spiritual tragedy of renun - ciation .

		A few new people appear in its pages , and quicken the flagging interest to a certain extent ; but we do not greatly care for the series of readjust - ments in the loves of these characters with which the story is largely concerned , and the romance that has shaped itself between Orange and
Madame Parflete	ORGANIZATION	is from the outset too evidently doomed to disruption .

		Yet the book has much charm the charm , at least , of distinction in its manner , and of the high-bred companionship with which it gratifies us .

		These interminable analyses of character are saved from becoming utterly wearisome by the deli - cate delineation and the subtle appreciation of mo - tive which they never fail to exhibit .

		The writer has lost none of her gift for phrase-making , and yet the penetration of her work by real ideas is as unquestionable as the amazing cleverness with which she shapes her points .

		Reactionary as her fundamental ideal may seem to us , it is both self - consistent and thoroughly sincere .

		Miss Silberrad 's first novel , `` The Enchanter , '' was a work of considerable promise , although marred by a vein of mysticism that gave the story an air of unreality .

		Her second novel , '' The Lady of Dreams , '' errs , if anything , from an excess of realism , being in large measure a study of life in the slums of
London	LOCATION	.

		The central figure is a young girl of rare and elusive spiritual beauty , whose loveliness of character remains uninfluenced by her repulsive surroundings , and who suggests a water - lily blooming amid the foulness of a stagnant pool .

		She is wooed and won by a middle-aged physician whose character is , in its way , almost as lovable as hers , and the fate which finally overtakes the pair , killing the one and forever wrecking the happiness of the other , seems unnecessarily tragic .

		The work displays undeniable talent , but fails to make a last - ing impression on the imagination .

		Mr.
Morley Roberts	PERSON	is an entertaining writer , with a talent for journalism rather than for liter - ature .

		His style has no graces , but has a good deal of animation , and makes its points in a rather telling fashion .

		His books always show the man of the world , who has knocked about a good deal , and who keeps close track of what is going on in the society and the politics of the present day .

		He has of late developed an aptitude for the roman h clef , and this description must be given to both of his new books .

		The characteristic is most marked in '' Lord Linlithgow , '' whose titular hero might as well have been named Lord
Rosebery	PERSON	outright , while the figure of
Eustace Loder	ORGANIZATION	is Mr.
Cecil Rhodes	PERSON	presented in as undisguised a shape as was the same figure in '' The Colossus '' of a year or so ago .

		The hero of the story is a rising young poli - tician of the Linlithgow following , and the plot turns upon a general election which is expected to bring the liberal imperialists into office .

		This elec - tion , again , turns upon certain documents of a nature compromising to the opposition , which it is essential should be brought to light .

		They are in the hands of an unscrupulous radical politician , who has no earthly right to retain them , but who refuses to give them up .

		The hero obtains a hold upon him by coming into possession of a secret which concerns his private character , and , with much reluctance , uses this knowledge to extort a restitution of the documents .

		This raises a pretty question of casuistry , and the novelist makes the most of it .

		When the decisive step has been taken , the hero is filled with remorse , determines to abandon public life , and succumbs to an attack of brain fever .

		The agony is piled up rather more thickly than seems strictly necessary , but the hero at last rallies from his illness , accepts the seat in
Parliament	LOCATION	which the election has brought him , and discovers that he has not forfeited the love of the remarkably ingenuous young woman who plays the part of the heroine .

		The other novel by Mr.
Roberts	PERSON	is called '' The Fugitives , '' and is a romance of the South African war .

		A young Englishman seeks to win the maiden whom he loves by starting out , at her be - hest , on a mission to the
Transvaal	LOCATION	, for the pur - pose of rescuing an officer , who is held prisoner at
Pretoria	LOCATION	.

		He equips himself with letters from the Mischief Maker at
Brussels	LOCATION	-LRB- who might as well have been named without ceremony -RRB- , gets to
Pretoria	LOCATION	with some difficulty , arranges the escape , and gets off with his rescued friend .

		There is a good deal of adventure in this part of the narra - tive , and the effect is distinctly thrilling .

		As one of the first of what will doubtless prove a long series of South African war novels , '' The Fugi - tives '' sets a pace that may be regarded as satis - factory .

		`` The Son of Carleycroft , '' by Mr.
Theodore Burt Sayre	PERSON	, is a dashing and spirited romance of the time of Charles II .

		The historical interest is slight , but we become absorbed in the fortunes of the dare-devil hero and the coquettish heroine .

		It is a story of varied incident , exciting adventure , and wordy encounters of wit .

		If the wit is not exactly sparkling , it will serve , and the animation of the narrative is well sustained .

		Much the same comment may be made upon `` The King 's Deputy , '' by Mr.
M. A. Hinkson	PERSON	, although here the historical interest is more marked .

		The scene is
Dublin	LOCATION	at the close of the eighteenth century , and the plot centres about the Irish conspiracies against the royal authority .

		Grattan figures among the characters , as well as our old friend
Napper Tandy	ORGANIZATION	of the popular bal - lad .

		The story is a thin one , but not uninteresting . ''

		Chloris of the
Island	LOCATION	, '' the latest romance by Mr.
H. B. Marriott Watson	PERSON	, is a wild tale of love and villainy , of `` free trading '' and secret plot - 498 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, tings with the enemy , told of the southwest coast and of the time when a French invasion was an ever-living danger to
England	LOCATION	.

		The hero is almost as much of a swashbuckler as the desperate scoun - drel whose devices he sets himself to thwart , and the heroine is a hot-blooded and passionate crea - ture who proves his fit counterpart .

		The story has a strange fascination , and is pitched throughout at a high key of excitement .

		Heroics of all kinds are bestowed with a lavish hand upon the narra - tive , which has also a certain distinction of style , although its affectations of language are somewhat too pronounced to be altogether productive of a satisfactory effect .

		`` The Footsteps of a Throne , '' by Mr.
Max Femberton	PERSON	, repeats the success of the author 's ''
Kronstadt	LOCATION	, '' being a second romance of Russian life .

		The heroine is a beautiful woman of noble family , and her reckless escapades , combined with a passion for gambling , have brought her into dis - favor with the court .

		Confined by imperial order to her palace at
Moscow	LOCATION	, she is eating out her heart when a rescuer appears upon the scene in the person of an English nobleman , who falls in love with her , and , after many perils , including an expedition to the wilds of the
Caucasus	LOCATION	, carries her off to
England	LOCATION	as his wife .

		Mr.
Pemberton	PERSON	's crisp and animated style , together with his ac - quaintance with the scenes and social conditions which he describes , gives to the book an interest that does not flag , and makes it an admirable example of artificial romance . ''


Venice	LOCATION	, with her life and glory but a memory , is still the citta nobilissima a city of moods , all beautiful to the beauty-lover , all mystic to the dreamer ; between the wonderful blue of the water and the sky she floats like a mirage visionary unreal and under the spell of her fascination we are not critics , but lovers . ''

		These introductory words strike the keynote of Mrs.
Lawrence Turn	PERSON	- bull 's historical novel called '' The Golden Book of
Venice	LOCATION	, '' and , as we turn its pages in sympa - thetic mood , we become '' not critics , but lovers , '' so great is the charm of the work , so compelling its power to bring back to us half-forgotten mem - ories of the city of the lagoons , and revivify count - less past associations that had half-faded from the consciousness .

		Jne does not often come upon a book so interpenetrated with a passion for its sub - ject , a book at once so firmly based upon historical fact , and so intensely spiritualized in the alembic of the imagination .

		The central figure of Mrs.
Turnbull	PERSON	's romance is that great scholar and theo - logian ,
Fra Paola Sarpi	PERSON	, and the story passes at the time when the proverbial saying , '' We are Venetians first , Christians afterwards , '' had its origin .

		In other words , it is the time when
Venice	LOCATION	, proudly resisting the pretensions of an arrogant papacy , and placed under an interdict , was cham - pioned by
Sarpi	LOCATION	, and emerged triumphant from the struggle .

		This situation offers splendid mater - ial for the historical novelist , and it has here been put to most effective use .

		Combined with it we have a tale of private love and suffering , of love between a young patrician and a daughter of the people , of suffering that grows out of the wife 's divided allegiance to her husband and the interests of the state , on the one hand , and to her religious ideals , on the other .

		For in all this terrible matter of the interdict , the heroine remains steadfast in her faith that the Church must be right , and when the
Church	ORGANIZATION	is defied by those whom she holds dearest , her life is slowly sapped away in a sort of spiritual agony .

		This woman , who displays the soul of a St.
Catherine	PERSON	amid the evils that beset her , is studied with rare insight and sympathy ; she almost persuades us to espouse her cause , although reason asserts it to be the cause of igno - rance against knowledge , of tyranny against free - dom .

		This book is much the most important that Mrs.
Turnbull	PERSON	has yet written ; for in it she for the first time comes down from the clouds , and plants herself upon solid earth , yet relinquishes no essen - tial part of the insuperable idealism which is her most marked characteristic . ''

		The Cobbler of Nimes , '' by Miss
Mary Imlay Taylor	PERSON	, is a story of the Huguenot persecutions under
Louis XIV	ORGANIZATION	.

		The scene is in the
CeVennes	LOCATION	region , and the time the beginning of the eight - eenth century .

		The story is a graceful idyl in the main , but it has a background of horrors , and the writer exercises an admirable restraint in keep - ing them in the background .

		The framework is slight , and constructed upon conventional lines , but
Miss Taylor	PERSON	has the instinct of the story-teller , and the book is as pleasing as its four or five pre - decessors .

		Some years ago , a formless and fantastic piece of fiction entitled '' Etidorhpa '' was published , and found its way to a limited circle of readers .

		It was the work of Mr.
John Uri Lloyd	PERSON	, of
Cincin	LOCATION	- nati , a chemist by profession , and the conceit of the title -LRB- which was merely '' Aphrodite '' reversed -RRB- seemed typical of the unregulated sort of imagina - tion which the book displayed .

		It certainly gave no promise of further work on conventional lines , and it is something of a surprise to find in '' String - town on the Pike , '' Mr.
Lloyd	PERSON	's second production , a novel sufficiently like the run of current fiction to admit of classification .

		This book is a picture of life in a
Kentucky	LOCATION	country town during the period of the Civil War .

		Its method is that of realism , and its plot is one of considerable interest .

		Amateurish and ill-balanced though it be , it some - how has got the trick of holding our attention , and even of persuading us to make our way through many tangled pages of a peculiarly difficult species of negro dialect .

		The principal character , in fact , is that of old
Cupe	ORGANIZATION	, whose strange mental processes and superstitious beliefs enable the author to make a rich exhibit of negro folk-lore .

		These super - stitions are used too seriously as a motive in the plot , but they are woven into the fabric of the narrative with great ingenuity , and the impression
1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , made by them is distinctly uncanny .

		The various types of white character are delineated with no little skill , and it must be said that the author has the instinct of the novelist , although lacking in the technical training .

		There is a fresh vigor about his book that atones for many faults , and , as one dramatic or melodramatic situation succeeds an - other , one can not fail to be impressed by the fer - tility of resource displayed , as well as by the fund of keen observation from which the author has been able to draw .

		Being an eminent mathematician and astronomer does not prevent Mr.
Simon Newcomb	PERSON	from being several other things with almost equal success .

		Some years ago , be published a treatise on political econ - omy which must have been something of a surprise even to those who knew him best , for it was the work of a man who had mastered the subject , and compared favorably with the productions of the best professional economists .

		Now Mr.
Newcomb	PERSON	has turned novelist for a change , and has written a romance of the scientific imagination which is also a distinctly successful production .

		It is called `` His Wisdom the Defender , '' and tells the story of a new kind of air-ship .

		Strictly speaking , the inven - tion is more than an air-ship , for it enables its in - ventor so to defy the law of gravitation that he soars above the atmosphere and circumnavigates the globe in the medium of the luminiferous ether .

		The invention is put to a philanthropic purpose , for it is made the means of doing away with warfare , and establishing an era of universal peace .

		How the great powers are forced to accept the situation , how their forces are disarmed and their navies sunk , are matters that go to make up a tale as startling as any told by
M. Jules Verne	PERSON	, and a tale , moreover , that even to the searching criticism of exact science has no slight degree of verisimili - tude .

		There is also a mere hint of a love story , but this might as well have been suppressed , for it affords the least realistic feature of the book , and is the product of a too visible effort . ''

		Rafnaland , '' by Mr.
W. H. Wilson	PERSON	, is also a story of an air-ship , but in this case we have to do with a simple balloon , not with a new form of en - ergy .

		A young man become an aeronaut malgri lui drifts northward to the very pole , and there discovers a habitable country , populated by a
Norse	ORGANIZATION	colony that had sought refuge for themselves and their gods some thousand years before , at the time when Christianity was being forced upon their re - luctant kinsfolk by the method of fire and sword .

		Here in their new home these Norsemen had pre - served their faith , their language , and their an - cient customs , and here our hero was made welcome and adopted into the race .

		The fair Astrid consoles him for the loss of home and kindred , and the love interest is made conspicuous , although agreeably varied by fighting and other forms of diversion .

		We find ourselves fairly plunged into the life of the sagas , and their spirit is skilfully reproduced by the writer 's invention .

		In the end , the hero and the heroine take flight in the old balloon reinflated with volcanic hydrogen and are fated to die of cold and exposure .

		But their story has been written out , and is brought back to civilization by the ship that discovers their remains .

		it .

		At the head of the season 's list of art works proper must be placed Lady Dilke 's scholarly and superbly illustrated treatise on the chief '' French Architects and Sculptors of the XVIIIth Century '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The volume is designed to carry forward and supplement the work begun last year in the same author 's '' French Painters of the XVIIIth Century , '' and the system followed is the same .

		The artists chosen for treatment are those who left most plainly their impress on the art of their time , and whose spirit and treatment reflected most clearly the ideals distinctive of their century .

		The architects are seen to be engaged largely in solving the problems peculiar to a day of transition in remodelling and adapting the old , and bring - ing it into closer correspondence with modern ideals of comfort and convenience .

		The sculptors give a new direction to the fanciful `` sculpture d'ap - partement , '' and assert their independence giving to the statue , and then to the statuette , a new sig - nificance .

		Many of the finest achievements of masters like
Guillaume Coustou	PERSON	fils ,
Pigalle	LOCATION	,
Hou	PERSON	- don , Clod ion , Falconnet ,
Lemoyne	PERSON	,
Caffieri	LOCATION	, are little known even in their own country ; and one is glad to see justice done them in this beautiful and solidly wrought work . ''

		My object , '' says
Lady Dilke	PERSON	, '' is to trace the traditions by which the chief amongst these men were guided ; to give such an account of their lives as may render them some - thing more than mere names to us ; to bring order into our conception of their works ; and to support the conclusions of the text by typical illustrations of their performance . ''

		We shall not attempt here to particularize as to the character and attractions of these beautiful and , in many cases , unfamiliar de - signs .

		They are finely reproduced ; and we counsel the reader of artistic tastes not to rob himself of a genuine pleasure through failing to inspect them .

		The volume is superbly printed , and in every phy - sical regard worthy of its content .

		Eloquent with the echoes of an enchanting by - gone world is the noble volume containing a trans - lation , by
Florence Simmonds	PERSON	and
M. Jourdain	PERSON	, of
Pierre Gusman	PERSON	's ``
Pompeii	LOCATION	:
The City	LOCATION	, its Life and Art '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- .


M. Gusman	PERSON	's encyclopaedic book is first of all a work of laboriously won archae - ological knowledge ; it is also a work of consci - entiously restrained and disciplined historical imagination , through every page of which the writer 's enthusiasm shines .


M. Gusman	PERSON	has not attempted a complete imaginary reconstruction of 500 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	,
Pompeii	LOCATION	, that is to say , his work is not vitiated by the element of mere conjecture .

		But he has honestly tried to so marshal and interpret the many and graphic evidences we have of the life and architectural aspect of the buried city as to make it live again for us as nearly as possible .

		In his own words , his book is '' a history of the
Pompei	PERSON	- ans , illustrated by themselves . ''

		The volume opens with a short historical review ; then follow chapters severally headed : The Tombs , the Temples and the Various Cults ; Public Buildings and
Recrea	PERSON	- tions of
Pompei	LOCATION	; The Streets Inscriptions Industries ; The
Giaeco-Roman House	ORGANIZATION	; The Arts .

		The illustrations are on a lavish scale , and would seem to leave no phase of Pompeian life untouched .

		They consist of 500 text illustrations and twelve colored plates , from drawings by the author .

		The volume is one of the handsomest of the season 's gift-books , and it forms a rich mine of entertain - ment and instruction .

		Mr.
Joel Cook	PERSON	's '' America : Picturesque and Descriptive '' is issued in three well-manufactured and beautifully - illustrated volumes by
Messrs. Henry T. Coates & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Cook	PERSON	's object is to give the busy reader who has no time or opportunity for travel such comprehensive general knowledge as every intelligent American ought to have of the geography , history , picturesque attractions , local peculiarities , and so on , of his own country .

		Mr.
Cook	PERSON	's descriptions are concise and literal , and are the result largely of notes taken by him during years of extended travel in the
United States	LOCATION	and
Canada	LOCATION	.

		The work is arranged in twenty-one tours , each volume beginning at the older settle - ments upon the
Atlantic	LOCATION	sea-board , and each '' tour '' describing a route such as the traveller would ordinarily take from the given starting-point .

		Mr.
Cook	PERSON	has skimmed in his sight-seeing flights the main points of interest in this country pretty comprehensively , and he gives us glimpses of Can - ada and
Alaska	LOCATION	as well .

		The information conveyed is necessarily superficial , but it is certainly such as none of us should be without .

		The book is of no literary pretension , which is doubtless a point in its favor .

		The photogravure plates , of which there are a great many , are well chosen as to subject , and are , in point of execution , notably meritorious specimens of their kind .

		Those wisest of classics , the ' Meditations of
Marcus Aurelius	PERSON	Antoninus '' and the '' Essayes or Counsels '' of
Francis Bacon	PERSON	, reappear this season in particularly alluring companion editions , under the joint imprint of
J. M. Dent & Co.	ORGANIZATION	of
London	LOCATION	and
E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	of
New York	LOCATION	.

		The '' Meditations '' are given in
Casaubon	PERSON	's translation , under the editorship of Mr.
W. H. D. Rouse	PERSON	, who supplies an Introduction , with Glossary and Ap - pendix .

		Casaubon 's version is printed without emendation , though the cumbersome and confusing brackets of the original editions are omitted , as are the discursive and not strictly elucidatory notes .

		Mr.
Walter Worrall	PERSON	is the editor of the '' Essayes , '' an excellent Introduction is provided by Mr.
Oliphant Stneaton	PERSON	, and several useful Appendices are in - cluded .

		The text followed is that of
1625	DATE	,
Bacon	ORGANIZATION	's final and complete edition .

		The spelling and punc - tuation have been '' modernized , '' and we are glad to note that the errors usually incident to this pro- cess seem here to have been avoided .

		Both volumes are light to the hand , and the strong and handsome typography is most inviting .

		The numerous plates in photogravure , rubricated head and tail pieces , initials , and chapter-headings , and the exquisite cover-designs , complete an exterior ensemble at once elegant and dainty .

		For a friend of cultivated tastes we can suggest no better gift-books than these .

		Bound in white , the two volumes decorated with the lymphad which forms the distinctive heraldic emblem of the city , the late Grant
Allen	PERSON	's ''
Paris	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Page -RRB- forms a beautiful addition to the half guide - book , half history , series which is so much in vogue at the present time .

		The illustrations are numerous and pertinent , the facade of Notre Dame being represented in the frontispiece of the first volume and the
Venus de Milo	PERSON	in that of the second .

		The narrative is planned as an artistic itinerary for the sojourner in the French capital , and the pains he may take to follow its directions will bear fruit in the thoroughness with which the real beauties of the French capital will disclose themselves to his searching eyes .

		Especially valuable is a chapter or two on '' How to Study Paintings in the
Louvre	LOCATION	. ''

		Though Grant
Allen	PERSON	was rather a man of science than an art student or critic , he was also a man of judgment and taste , and his instructions can be made to bear fruit in even the most ordinary hands .

		A tastefully embellished , pleasantly and tactfully written , book is
Virginia Tatnall Peacock	PERSON	's '' Famous American Belles of the Nineteenth Century '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The author has selected her subjects not alone for the distinction of personal charm , but also for the qualities which contribute to social and , in a sense , political eminence , as is evinced by the inclusion of such names as
Elizabeth Patterson	PERSON	,
Margaret O'Neill	PERSON	,
Harriet Lane	PERSON	,
Kate Chase	PERSON	,
Etnilie Schaumburg	LOCATION	,
Jennie Jerome	PERSON	, and so on .

		There are nineteen names in the list , which begins with
Marcia Burns	PERSON	, and closes with
Mary Victoria Leiter	PERSON	.

		The portraits are both charming and interesting -LRB- the initial one is printed in colors -RRB- , and the delicate binding of light-blue and gilt rounds out a harmonious whole .

		We should not care to be the owner of mind insensible to the manifold attractions of the new Holiday edition of Mr.
James Lane Allen	PERSON	's '' A
Ken	PERSON	- tucky Cardinal '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		To illustrate the charming story seems like painting the lily ; but we admit , now we have inspected them , inhaled their dainty , subtly suggestive fragrance , as it were , that the one hundred drawings by
Hugh Thomson	PERSON	which form the main new feature of the edition strikes us as having been all along the one

		THE DIAL 501 element needed to make Mr.
Allen	PERSON	's story perfect in its kind .

		There is also a delightful Introduc - tion by Mr.
Allen	PERSON	, and the volume contains the sequel , '' Aftermath , '' as well .

		The cover of light green shows a design in gilt of Chaucerian sug - gestiveness birds and boughs and leafy sprays , etc. .

		All in all , the volume is one of the tastefullest in its class this season .

		There is no end to books about
Paris	LOCATION	, nor , we suppose , to the demand for them .

		All sanguine people hope to get to
Paris	LOCATION	some day ; and the prudent ones like to '' read up '' beforehand , to be ready for the blessed contingency when it hap - pens .

		The latest book of the kind , and one , we should think , distinctly meant for the behoof of the sanguine souls aforesaid , is Mr.
E. A. Reynolds	PERSON	- Ball 's two-volume work called ''
Paris	LOCATION	in its Splen - dor '' -LRB-
Dana Estes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The book is mainly descriptive , though there is a vein of history run - ning through it .

		The author says that he has tried to give a general impression of
Paris	LOCATION	past and present , and of the more striking features of the social life of
Paris	LOCATION	of today .

		On its guide book side -LRB- and it is really a superior sort of guide to
Paris	LOCATION	and its worthier sights -RRB- the book furnishes much information as to museums and picture - galleries , historic churches , monuments , historic spots and buildings , parks , drives , and gardens , and so on .

		The volumes are handsomely made fine paper , excellent print , and exquisite covers of white-and-gold , protected by red slip-covers .

		There are 65 photographic plates .

		Of panoramic quality is the flat oblong volume , entitled '' The War in
South Africa	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
P. F. Collier & Son	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , containing Captain
A. T. Mahan	PERSON	's valuable account of the Anglo-Boer conflict from the opening of hostilities to the fall of
Pretoria	LOCATION	.

		An Introduc - tion is supplied by Sir
John G. Bourinot	PERSON	, and the book , on the whole , seems to be the coolest and most impersonal -LRB- and therefore the most instructive as to facts -RRB- narrative of the military side of the deplorable South African business that has yet ap - peared .

		The copious and striking photographic pictures , a number of which are reproduced in colors , have the effect of transporting one in fancy to the scene of hostilities , and are of undeniable interest .

		Good to look at and pleasant to read are the two comely little volumes entitled '' Rambles in Colonial Byways '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- .

		In them the author sets forth in pleasing style the result of his observations during a series of leisurely jaunts to various nooks and byways in
New England	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	, and alofig the
Hudson	LOCATION	, in
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	and through
Washington	LOCATION	's country , the spots vis - ited being such as are memorable for their associa - tions and souvenirs of Colonial and Revolutionary days .

		A set of charming photographic plates serves to adorn the work and vivify the text .

		Particularly pretty are the bindings in grass-green buckram stamped with a view of a colonial house and garden .

		The death
last April	DATE	of that gentle pictorial satirist of our national errors , political and other ,
Francis Gilbert Attwood	PERSON	, left a void in the pages of
New York	LOCATION	's bright little periodical , '' Life , '' not easily supplied .

		Mr.
Attwood	PERSON	's drawings were always clear , significant , wholesome .

		It was sel - dom that they failed of a palpable hit .

		They were delightfully humorous , and their humor was gener - ally of the subtler sort that appeals to the intelli - gence .

		Most of them were contributed to '' Life , '' and the publishers of that periodical now issue the best of them collected in chronological sequence in a neat volume entitled `` Attwood 's Pictures . ''

		Thus arranged they form a pleasant pictorial his - tory , in the satirist 's vein , mainly , of the closing decade of the past century .

		There is never any mistaking Mr.
Attwood	PERSON	's meaning , and his portraits , for all their humor , are recognizable at once .

		The
Fleming H. Revell Company	ORGANIZATION	issue , in a well-made quarto volume , '' The Psalms of
David	PERSON	, '' with sixteen full-page drawings and numerous dec - orations by
Louis Rhead	PERSON	, and an introductory study of the psalmist by the Rev.
Newell Dwight Hillis	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Rhead	PERSON	's pictures are much in the style of his contributions to the pictorial '' Pil - grim 's Progress '' of a season or so ago , and his decorations are simple and do not overbalance the clear and open print , which shows to advantage against a white-margined ground of delicate vel - lum-tint .

		In his introductory study Dr.
Hillis	PERSON	tells in an agreeable way the story of
David	PERSON	's life , and points out its bearings upon the general scheme of human conduct .

		The volume is richly bound in claret-color and gold , and forms an obviously suit - able Christmas gift .

		Mr.
Sadakichi Hartmann	PERSON	announces in his preface to `` Shakespeare in Art '' -LRB- Page -RRB- that he is excep - tionally well qualified for the task he has underta - ken , having given himself such a preparation through a series of years as few men can pretend to .

		The intention of his work is to present in a form necessarily brief because of the magnitude of the undertaking some account of the various forms of art and the notable examples in each form which have busied themselves in picturing Shake - speare or his characters .

		The first chapter deals with the portraits a threshing out of old straw which neither enlarges nor diminishes our custom - ary knowledge of the subject .

		Other sections of the book have to do with the illustrators and with the painters , etchers , engravers , and sculptors who have enhanced their own and the great dramatist 's fame by their works .

		The Droeshout etching is used as a frontispiece for the volume , and there are numerous half-tone reproductions of famous paint - ings and portraits scattered throughout the pages .

		Mr.
Louis C. Elson	PERSON	has performed a valuable service for the student in his new book with the explanatory title , u Shakespeare in Music : A Col - lation of the Chief Musical Allusions in the Plays of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, with an Attempt at Their Explan - 502 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, ation and Derivation , together with Much of the Original Music '' -LRB- Page -RRB- .

		Nothing so extensive of the kind has been attempted heretofore , nor has any result quite so thorough been achieved , the combination of musical and dramatic know - ledge which does not burn itself out in attention to opera being unusual .

		Profusely illustrated , both with pictures and musical scores , with a learned dissertation on the dances of the time by way of good measure , Mr.
Elson	PERSON	has produced a work of considerable authority and great interest .

		Among the few omissions of the book is to be noted a fail - ure to grasp the significance of the Irish tongue as affording a key to certain obscurely un-English expressions in the text of the dramas .

		Nor should the sub-title have limited itself to '' plays '' alone , the poems being frequently expounded in respect of their musical references .

		Messrs.
T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's commendable '' Coxhoe '' edition of
Elizabeth Barrett Browning	PERSON	's Complete Works comprises six volumes -LRB- 18uao , 4x6 inches -RRB- , enclosed in a strong case with hinged cover .

		Each volume contains a frontispiece in pho - togravure .

		The editing , by
Charlotte Porter	ORGANIZATION	and
Helen A. Clarke	PERSON	, has been carefully and helpfully done , and the initial volume is supplied with a
Biographical Introduction and Bibliography	ORGANIZATION	.

		The edition is convenient and desirable ; and its general get-up is suggestive of presentation uses .

		More Omar !

		The volume this time contains
Fitzgerald	PERSON	's versions of the Ruba * iyt , a
Life of Fitzgerald	ORGANIZATION	, some verses to Omar by
Justin H. McCarthy	PERSON	, a poem by
Porter Garnett	PERSON	, a batch of Notes , a Life of Omar quite enough for one 's money .

		But to make the volume thicker yet its leaves of rather heavy calendered paper are doubled , so that , despite the quantitative thinness of its piece de resistance , we get a fairly thick octavo after all .

		Omar is difficult to illustrate , but
Miss Florence Lundborg	ORGANIZATION	has tried hard to do him some sort of justice in this publication .

		Candor compels us to say that where
Vedder	PERSON	succeeded indifferently well ,
Miss Lundborg	PERSON	has scarcely succeeded at all .

		Her drawings smack a little of
Vedder	PERSON	's wild and whirling symbolizations .

		They smack perhaps more of
Aubrey Beardsley	PERSON	of whose fantasticalities we have surely had enough .

		We sincerely wish Miss
Lundborg	PERSON	better luck next time in point of subject , for she deserves it .

		The volume is heavy to the hand , and its cover shows an uninviting combination in dull chocolate and black .

		-LRB-
Doxey	ORGANIZATION	's . -RRB-

		Miss
Margaret Armstrong	PERSON	is well and deserv - edly to the fore this season as a decorative artist , and in Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's ornate edition of
Browning	PERSON	's ''
Pippa	PERSON	Passes '' she acquits herself creditably as an illustrator proper as well .

		The decorations of the volume are very profuse , the main feature being the marginal borders and semi - borders showing a medley of designs in figures , symbols , slightly conventionalized foliage , flowers , fruit , etc. .

		A border of very light vellum-tint surrounds the text of each page , and serves as an effective ground for the drawings .

		The cover is decidedly one of the prettiest of the year , and the publication , all in all , is well conceived and well wrought out .

		The richly colored and gilded cover-design , pro- fuse illustrations , and illuminated title-page lend distinction to the outer ensemble of the seasonable gift-book entitled '' Women of the Bible '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The text consists of twelve sketches of Biblical heroines Eve ,
Sarah	PERSON	,
Miriam	PERSON	,
Ruth	PERSON	,
Esther	PERSON	,
Mary	PERSON	the Mother of Jesus , etc. from the pens of as many eminent divines , Dr.
Lyman Abbott	PERSON	, Dr.
Henry Van Dyke	PERSON	, Cardinal
Gibbons	PERSON	,
Bishop Hurst	ORGANIZATION	, Bishop
Potter	PERSON	, and others .

		The learned and rev - erend writers havf treated their respective themes gracefully and entertainingly , as well as instruct - ively ; so that the book , with its liberal embellish - ments , is one to charm as well as edify .

		A temper as sweet and as contemplative as Wal - ton 's , a sense for the subtler facts of nature as fine as
Jefferies	ORGANIZATION	's , lend distinction among works of its class to Dr.
Charles C. Abbott	PERSON	's '' In Nature 's Realm '' -LRB-
Albert Brandt	PERSON	,
Trenton	LOCATION	-RRB- , a charming volume which we have already had occasion to praise .

		For the comparatively uninitiated votary of Nature , who would study her in all her moods and divine her best-kept secrets , we know of no better or pleasanter guide , philosopher , and friend , than Dr.
Abbott	PERSON	.

		The volume is suitably illus - trated by
Oliver Kemp	PERSON	, and we are glad especially to call attention to the typographical beauty of the book and to the exceptional quality of the material used in its manufacture a feature characteristic of all of this publisher 's productions that we have seen .

		The exquisite setting bestowed by its publishers upon
Eugene Field	PERSON	's newspaper skit entitled '' The Temptation of Friar Gonsol '' -LRB-
Woodward & Lothrop	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- will be a matter of some wonderment to readers outside the circle of Mr.
Field	PERSON	's old familiars , and therefore unable to appreciate the local and personal hits which are the life of the piece , such as it has .

		The fun of '' Friar Gonsol '' is not of a side-splitting order , in any case .

		Out - wardly the volume is very pretty and artistic .

		It contains several portraits of the author , a facsimile of the '' proof '' of ''
Friar Gonsol	PERSON	, '' and so on .

		The cover is of semi flexible white vellum tied with cherry ribbons , and the edition is limited to three hundred copies . ''

		Contemporary American Composers , '' by
Rupert Hughes	PERSON	, and '' Famous Pianists of To-Day and Yes - terday , '' by
Henry C. Lahee	PERSON	, form a brace of ac - ceptable additions to
Messrs. L. C. Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's pretty and convenient '' Music Lovers ' Series . ''

		Mr.
Hughes	PERSON	has written a well considered and rather comprehensive critical study of contemporary na - tive music , and his researches have led him to the cheerful conclusion that some of the very best mod - ern music is being written here at home , and only needs the light to secure its due meed of praise .

		1900 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 503 Mr.
Haghes	PERSON	's industry is patent throughout the book , and we admit the force of his contention that the fact that he has gone through '' at least a ton of American compositions '' with undiminished en - thusiasm is evidence of some virtue in native music examples of which , by the way , he reproduces .

		Among the composers treated in the volume are Ed - ward
MacDowell	ORGANIZATION	,
John P. Souaa	PERSON	,
Henry Schoene	PERSON	- feld ,
G. W. Chadwick	PERSON	,
Harry Rowe Shelley	PERSON	,
F. F. Bullard	PERSON	,
A. J. Goodrich	PERSON	,
Margaret Ruthven	PERSON	,
Lang	PERSON	, etc. .

		More biographical in treatment are Mr.
Lahee	PERSON	's sketches of '' Famous Pianists , '' issued by the same firm , in the same series .

		The names are arranged as nearly as possible in chronological or - der , and the list includes , besides artists of world - wide reputation , the best known local pianists , both of
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Lahee	PERSON	writes agree - ably , and with ample knowledge of his theme .

		Each volume is liberally equipped with portraits , and each forms a pretty and suitable gift for a music - loving friend .

		Mrs.
Elizabeth F. Ellet	PERSON	's comprehensive series of sketches of '' Women of the American Revolu - tion '' is deservedly republished in attractive form and with a generous array of portraits , by
Messrs. George W. Jacobs & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mrs.
Anne Hollingsworth Wharton	PERSON	supplies a needed Introduction .

		The table of contents shows a long list of names , many of which will doubtless be unfamiliar to most read - ers , but none of which seem to be unworthy of inclusion .

		Mrs.
Ellet	PERSON	's sketches were written long before the current fad for things Colonial showed itself , and this may be considered by some a point in their favor .

		Her material , too , was gathered at a time when it was still possible to question wit - nesses who could speak from memory directly to the facts , and hence , as Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	notes , there are many passages in the book in which the fruit of such gleaning is manifest in the vividness and circumstantiality with which scenes and characters are depicted .

		Dividing the sexes with a Shaker-like strictness , Mr.
Lewis C. Strang	PERSON	prepares two volumes of con - temporaneous dramatic history , calling one '' Prima Donnas and Soubrettes '' and the other , '' Cel - ebrated Comedians , '' using the same sub-title for both '' of Light Opera and Musical Comedy in
America	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Page -RRB- .

		The two volumes , bound in white for Christmas gifts , have the same general plan and treatment throughout .

		Mr.
Strang	PERSON	's concern is with singers and comedians whose at - tractions still pass current among us , and in this regard he is catholic in his tastes .

		In one volume Misses
Alice Nielson	PERSON	,
Lillian Russell	PERSON	,
Virginia Earle	LOCATION	,
Fay Templeton	PERSON	,
Delia Fox	ORGANIZATION	,
Josephine Hall	PERSON	,
Mesdames Edna Wallace Hopper	PERSON	,
Jessie Bartlett Davis	PERSON	, and others of their sisters find place beside such professional '' entertainers '' as Miss
Marie Dressier	PERSON	and Miss
Maud Raymond	PERSON	, and are dis - cussed in a breezy , newspaperish manner .

		In the other volume inclusiveness also is sought rather than particularity , such extremes as Mr.
Henry Clay Barnabee	PERSON	and Mr.
Francis Wilson	PERSON	, Mr.
Digby Bell	PERSON	and the
Rogers Brothers	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Frank E. Dan	PERSON	- iels and Mr.
Peter F. Dailey	PERSON	, Mr.
Henry E. Dixey	PERSON	and Mr.
Otis Harlan	PERSON	meeting in the pages .

		The two books speak more for American good nature than American art , either musical or histrionic .

		Numerous half-tone reproductions of photographs decorate the volumes .

		A rather happy conception is embodied in the desirable volume entitled '' Wonders of Nature '' -LRB-
Dodd	PERSON	-RRB- , the contents of which have been edited , and in some instances translated , by Miss
Esther Singleton	PERSON	.

		The book is a compilation of descrip - tions by writers of more or less celebrity , of striking natural views and scenic phenomena , the principle or ground of selection being subjectiveness of treat - ment and literary merit , rather than topographical or scientific accuracy and interest .

		The selections have been made with taste , and where translation has been called for it has been gracefully and intel - ligently done .

		There are forty-six papers in all , and nearly as many full-page plates in half-tone , which are of acceptable quality .

		Those seeking models of style in this order of descriptive writing will find the book a treasure-house of examples .

Greene	PERSON	's racy
New England	LOCATION	novel '' Vesty of the Basins '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- has already won its way to public favor , and we are glad to see it reissued in tempting Holiday dress , of which the main feature is the many illustrations from draw - ings by
Otto H. Bacher	PERSON	and from photographs by
Clifton Johnson	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	's photographs serve to accentuate the local flavor of the book , while its `` daown East '' drollery and quiet sentiment are faithfully reflected in Mr.
Bacher	PERSON	's designs .

		A welcome addition is the frontispiece portrait of the author . ''

		The Friendly Year '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is a little year - book of selections in prose and verse , an extract for each day , from the works of Dr.
Henry van Dyke	PERSON	, chosen and arranged by the Rev.
George Sidney Webster	PERSON	.

		An extract from these cheery and wholesome writings is a good thing certainly to begin the day with , and Dr.
Webster	PERSON	's little an - thology should find friends .

		In indicating his prin - ciple of selection the editor says : `` I have not sought to illustrate literary qualities , so much as to bring out the dominant note of human friendliness and comradeship , which runs through the writings of an author who knows books well , but who cares more for people . ''

		A portrait of Dr. van Dyke forms the frontispiece .

		The very presentable yet moderate-priced new edition of
Fenimore Cooper	ORGANIZATION	published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	opens promisingly with '' The Last of the Mohicans . ''

		The volume a handy , full gilt , rather closely but legibly-printed 12 mo in light-green binding is prefaced by a general Introduction on Cooper by Mr.
Mowbray Morris	PERSON	, and contains twenty-five drawings of good quality by Mr.
H. M. Brock	PERSON	.

		We are glad to say that Mr.
Brock	PERSON	has not unduly '' Remington !

		zed '' his 504 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, author , but has impliedly recognized in his romance - tinged designs the fact that we go to
Cooper	PERSON	for the solace that comes from shaking off for the nonce the real and the literal , and that we would therefore be likely to prove the reverse of grateful to the artist who might persist in thrusting it back upon us every few pages in his provokingly matter - of-fact pictures .

		In `` The Pilgrim Shore '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Mr.
E. H. Garrett	PERSON	has done for the South Shore of
Massachusetts Bay	LOCATION	what he did for the
North Shore of New England	ORGANIZATION	in his '' Romance and Reality of the Puritan Coast . ''

		The whole South Shore and its towns ,
Dorchester	LOCATION	,
Neponset	LOCATION	,
Quincy	PERSON	,
Weymouth	LOCATION	,
Hingham	LOCATION	,
Hull	PERSON	,
Duxbury	LOCATION	,
Plymouth	LOCATION	, etc. , is treated in this volume .

		There are many full-page drawings and vignettes , the treatment mingling description and fancy in due proportions .

		The book is pleasantly written , and makes a brave showing in its tasteful binding of white and gold .

		Considerable amusement may be found in Mr.
Gay Wetmore	PERSON	Carry 1 's '' Mother Goose for Grown -
Ups	ORGANIZATION	'' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , and we should be sorry to possess the soul that could see nothing funny in Mr.
Peter Newell	PERSON	's illustrations in the same .

		Mr.
Carryl	PERSON	has adapted the old nursery jingles in much the same manner as he dealt with the fables of La Fontaine some time since .

		Mr.
Newell	PERSON	has a humor all his own ; but his debt as an artist to
Boutet de Monvel	ORGANIZATION	is plain .

		Other drawings in the book are by Mr.
Gustave Verbeck	PERSON	.

		Charles Lever 's rollicking song of ''
Tipperary Joe	PERSON	, '' which readers of ''
Jack Hinton	PERSON	, the Guards - man '' will remember , makes its appearance , re - christened '' The Song of a Vagabond Huntsman '' -LRB-
Russell	PERSON	-RRB- , in a flat oblong volume , with a gayly colored frontispiece and a number of other pictures in monotint , all the work of Wm.
Anderson Sher	PERSON	- wood .

		Mr.
Sherwood	PERSON	's drawings , of which there are one to each verse , faithfully reflect the humor of the song , and the book should certainly find favor in the Hibernian eye .

		Mr.
Oliver Herford	PERSON	's skill in versification lends a certain distinction to most of the whimsically humorous verse in his little book of collected poems entitled `` Overheard in a Garden '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		The book is full of pretty conceits and neatly - turned rhymes , and the drawings , also by Mr.
Her	PERSON	- ford , duly reflect the spirit of the text .

		The cover - design , in colors , is quaintly fancied , and tempts one to peep within .

		The quaint fun of that funniest of our illustra - tors ,
F. Opper	PERSON	, is pleasantly exemplified in the thirty odd drawings , each with its accompanying scrap of verse , contained in the flat folio volume entitled `` The Folks in Funnyville '' -LRB-
Russell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Mr.
Opper	PERSON	's pictures are always irresistible , and while his humor is broad , it is never vulgar a decided merit in a day when there is no little tempt - ation from press and public to eschew it .

		The publishers of '' Life '' have issued , under the title , `` Fore !

		Life 's Book for Golfers , '' a flat quarto volume wherein are set forth pictorially the ways and humors of the votaries of the fashionable game .

		The pictures are cleverly drawn , and the book seems a capital one to while away spare moments at the country club .

		Lovers of choice book-making will be strongly tempted by Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's artistic yet venturesome edition of
Sterne	PERSON	's '' Sentimental Jour - ney . ''

		The volume is rather freely rubricated , and its color element is accentuated by the boldly ex - ecuted frontispiece in black , dark-green , and red , .

		showing the immortal traveller about to hand the lady into the Desobligeant .

		Two trim little volumes entitled `` American Wit and Humor '' -LRB-
Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- are devoted , as the reader may surmise , to funny sayings culled from the columns of the comic papers , and from the '' comic columns '' of papers not wholly comic .

		The con - tents of the volumes are conveniently arranged , and those who relish newspaper fun may find the cream of it skimmed deftly into these two little books , each of which contains a frontispiece por - trait Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	and
Mark Twain	PERSON	, respectively , though how Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	got into such company we are at a loss to conjecture .

		We have not heretofore , so far as we remember , , been called upon to notice a set of illustrative draw - ings by
Florence Goldsmith Chandler	PERSON	, whose name as an illustrator is new to us ; but we take pleasure now in commending the fine poetic feeling and graceful sentiment apparent in her fifteen full-page designs which embellish the chastely ornate volume of devotional poems , entitled '' Psalms of Soul , '' by
William Bradford Dickson	PERSON	, published by the Tri - bune
Co.	ORGANIZATION	, of
South Bend	LOCATION	,
Indiana	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Diekson	PERSON	's verses are warmed throughout with real religious fervor , and their formal quality is respectable .

		The publishers have shown good taste in the make-up of the volume .

		Very dainty and fraught with mementos of sun - nier days are the twin anthologies of poems about flowers and poems about birds , respectively entitled '' Among the Flowers '' and '' Among the Birds '' -LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- , each volume brightened with its series of gayly-colored plates .

		The selections in each book are made with taste , and mostly from the standard poets .

		The volumes are portable and pocketable ; and either would form a pleasant companion for a ramble in places where , it is good to know , birds and flowers will again abound .


Goldsmith	PERSON	's `` She Stoops to Conquer , '' impec - cably printed , and liberally strewn with drawings by
E. A. Abbey	PERSON	, is wine of the sort that needs no bush .

		The book was a favorite several seasons ago , and now makes its reappearance in a new binding of unique design .

		Mr.

		THE DIAL 505 may have it in a pretty and pocketable volume at a moderate price .

		The artistic decorations in car - mine and black , by Mr.

		Beautiful Thoughts from
Robert	LOCATION	and
Eliza	PERSON	- beth
Browning	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Pott	PERSON	-RRB- is a pretty volume of selec - tions from the writings of these poets , a pageful for each day in the year .

		The book is ornately bound in sage-green and gold , with vignette of Mr.
Browning	PERSON	; and the editor ,
Miss Margaret Shipp	PERSON	, has done her work with taste and discernment .

		Dr.
Maltbie D. Babcock	PERSON	, whose calendar last year attracted attention through its pious and sen - tentious aspirations for each day of the year , has issued '' Dr.
Babcock	PERSON	's Calendar for
1901	DATE	'' -LRB-
John S. Bridges & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , making not only the necessary changes for another year , but adding numerous significant thoughts aptly expressed , at the same time rewriting many of the older ones .

		Mr.
Curtin	PERSON	's good version of
Sienkiewicz	PERSON	's fine prose poem '' The Judgment of
Peter	PERSON	and
Paul	PERSON	on
Olympus	ORGANIZATION	'' is brought out by
Messrs. Little	PERSON	,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	in an attractive booklet delicately bound in white , with illustrations .

		A pleasing page has been made by printing the text in violet , with a marginal frame in light-green .

		BOOKS FOB THE YOUNG .

		IL Fighting on land and tea .

		The Vulgate would have us read that the salutation of the heavenly choir is not for all mankind , but is to he translated , '' Peace on earth to men of good will ! ''

		What , then , of the books of war and rumors of war which continue to hold the first place -LRB- if numbers are a proof -RRB- in the reading provided for the young at this time ?

		History , it is true , is as bloody as a butcher 's shambles ; but need it remain so ?

		The first book of the group before us , in point of time , is by Mr.
Edward Robins	PERSON	, a plentifully illustrated account of a most disastrous rout , entitled `` With
Washington	LOCATION	in
Braddock	LOCATION	's Campaign '' -LRB-
Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- .

		It gives an excellent impression of
Washington	LOCATION	in the first flush of his manhood , and introduces that General
Gage	PERSON	whom he was to shut up in
Boston	LOCATION	not very many years later .

		Yet
Washington	LOCATION	was greatest because of his hold on the hearts of his countrymen , and he was first in peace as well as first in war .

		This latter phase of his character is obscured in such a work , interesting as it is in other respects .

		Mr.
Hezekiah Butterworth	PERSON	rescues the incident of the Knight of the Golden Horse - shoe from ill-deserved oblivion by preparing '' In the Days of
Jefferson	LOCATION	; or , The Six Golden Horseshoes , a Tale of Republican Simplicity '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- , a story of continental expansion and of
Jefferson	PERSON	's youth and manhood , the more striking because it is a book with little or no bloodshed .

		Mr.
Frank T. Merrill	PERSON	provides the drawings for the volume , which is one to be read and pondered over , even though the Jeffersonian enthu - siast may fancy he detects a note of something less than complete approbation for the hero in the hero 's present biographer .

		Aggression to-day must certainly revive tales of aggression yesterday , so the announcement of a series of three books concerning the Mexican War , , from the busy pen of Captain
Ralph Bonehill	PERSON	, is not to - be wondered at , though Americans generally have leffc that unfortunate conflict to deserved silence .

		But the first of the three books , '' For the Liberty of
Texas	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- , dealing as it does with
San Antonio	LOCATION	and the
Alamo	LOCATION	and ending with the battle of
San Jacinto	LOCATION	, does not bring forward the facts which led
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	to his cordial detestation of President Polk . ''

		Trav - ellers ' Tales of
South Africa	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- is also by Mr.
Hezekiah Butterworth	PERSON	, with illustrations drawn from numerous sources , a book which hardly does itself jus - tice with such a title .

		It contains some account of events in
South Africa	LOCATION	leading up to the present war , but its concern is even more with hunters and missionaries .

		Nor is the field limited to
South Africa	LOCATION	alone , the cen - tral portion of the continent coming in for a word of comment Mr.
Edward Stratemeyer	PERSON	has a method the reverse of literary , but it enables him to bring out the sort of books that boys appear to like , or there could not be so many of them . ''

		On to
Pekin	LOCATION	; or , Old Glory in
China	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the latest of these , and those who are quite sure that American civilization has suffered nothing from its contact with the inhab - itants of
China	LOCATION	in recent months will find much to enjoy in the book .

		The hero has been met in others of the author 's stories of battle , and there is much second - hand information about the scene of the war which is not a war .

		Historical frankness characterizes the Very Reverend
Cyrus Townsend Brady	PERSON	's ``
Reuben James	PERSON	, a Hero of the Forecastle '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- to a remarkable extent .

		James is one of the most pictur - esque figures in American naval history , and his utter self-devotion in saving the life of the younger
Decatur	LOCATION	has been a favorite topic with American poets and prose writers alike .

		When Mr.
James Jeffrey Roche	PERSON	composed his thrilling lines , he killed the sailor out of hand : a full-fledged hero who insists upon living many years , most of them in liquor , is more or less discouraging to poetry .

		But Mr.
Brady	PERSON	tells the story of the brave man 's life , and adds in an appendix nearly all that is said of him by others , concealing nothing .

		Last year Mr.
Ralph Barbour	PERSON	wrote one and ^ entwe f the best b oks f the 8ea8on and he ha8 repeated his performance this season with '' For the Honor of the
School	ORGANIZATION	, a
Story of School Life	ORGANIZATION	and Interscholastic Sport '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- .

		Hill ton , the institution of learning which was the scene of `` The Half-Back , '' appears again in this second volume , and brings forth the regret that some real school had not been selected and named , after the fashion of ''
Tom Brown	PERSON	's School Days . ''

		Mr.
Harbour	PERSON	's books are whole - some from cover to cover , interesting enough to hold the attention of any man who has not let his wits get '' square-toed '' also , in
Thackeray	PERSON	's phrase , and without a bit of that forced romance which too many writers inject into boys ' stories .

		Mr.
C. M. Relyea	PERSON	's pictures - add to the reality of the incidents they represent It is not necessary to have a mean boy in a book , and Mr.
Eustace Williams	PERSON	is right in making his protagonist sin in haste and repent at leisure in '' The Substitute Quarter-Back '' -LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The boy with whom the nar - rative is chiefly concerned , though he is not the hero in the usual sense of the word , betrays the signals of the school football team to its rival in revenge for having been taken off the first eleven and made a substitute just before the match .

		It is a delicate situation , but is well handled .

		Mr.
L. J. Bridgman	PERSON	makes the pictures .

		506 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, Mr.
George Alfred Henty	PERSON	leaves English boys for a time , and deals with a young American and a young Mexican in his latest volume , `` In the Hands of the Cave-Dwellers '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The title gives it a certain prehistoric sound , but the date goes back no further than
1832	DATE	, and the cave-dwellers are kindred to the Apaches of our southwestern frontier .

		The story is full of blood and adventure , with a bit of romance thrown in for good measure .

		Teaching the youthful idea how to shoot with a fowling-piece is the animating motive of '' The Boy Duck - Hunters '' -LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- , and the author , Mr.
Frank E. Kellogg	PERSON	, has given his book real value by filling its pages full of useful information about the ap - pearance and habits of American game birds .

		Mr.
J. W. Kennedy	PERSON	designs some of the pictures , but most of them are reproduced from
Audubon	ORGANIZATION	's famous plates , making the work a treasure to the boy who inclines to - ward being a naturalist , as healthy boys generally do . ''

		The Fortune Hunters of the
Philippines	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Mershon Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- sounds as if Senator
Beveridge	PERSON	had invented the .

		title , but it is really much simpler than that .

		The au - thor , Mr.
Louis Charles	PERSON	, wished a scene for the discovery of some buried Spanish treasure , and our new islands promised rather better than any others , so he sent his three American boys to
Manila	LOCATION	and its neighborhood .

		There is action enough in the book for twenty , and the reader draws a long breath when the wealth is safe in American hands '' Bully , Fag and Hero '' -LRB- Page -RRB- , is the tale of an English public school .

		It abounds with scenes strange to American understandings , one of the principal personages of the story being the '' Black Cadger , '' head game-keeper to a nobleman in the neigh - borhood of the school .

		The illustrations , by Mr.

Charles J. Mansford	PERSON	.

		Second of the '' Woodranger Tales '' -LRB- Page -RRB- , by Mr.

		It deals with the condition of the Acadians whom Longfellow cel - ebrated in ''
Evangeline	PERSON	, '' as they were flourishing at the time of
King George	ORGANIZATION	's War .

Cuba	LOCATION	libre ! ''

		`` Dear is my country , '' said
Francis Lieber	PERSON	, '' but liberty is dearer . ''

		The sentiment is not a usual one in books intended for those who are to rock the cradle and rule the world in a few brief years . ''

		For Tomniv , and Other Stories '' -LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- is also by Miss
Laura E. Richards	PERSON	, and is for somewhat smaller girls .

		It has nothing to do with Christmas particularly , but it has '' Moses '' and ' Billy '' and various other alluring young gentlemen scattered through the narra - tives in a convincing way .

		Mrs.
L. T. Meade	PERSON	's excel - lently contrived stories are augmented by '' A Plucky Girl '' -LRB-
Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- , an interesting account of the life of a young English gentlewoman who induces her mother to take '' paying guests '' after their fortune has given itself wings , to the advantage of all concerned in point of character-building , if not of comfort and ease .

		There is a hero , too , who makes his proper bow at the fall of the curtain , in the approved manner .

		Mrs.
Moles	PERSON	- worth 's '' Three Witches '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- are three young girls , who abundantly deserve the appellation .

		Mr.
Lewis Baumer	PERSON	provides the excellent illustrations .

		Mrs.
Molesworth	PERSON	's books require no praise from us at this time .

		They deserve the uniformly high reputation given them , being simple , unaffected , and interesting . ''

		Chums '' -LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- comes as a surprise , being from the hand of the late
Maria Louise Pool	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a school story to begin with , and a story of country life to end with , being unconventional and sprightly throughout .

		Mr.
L. J. Bridgman	PERSON	furnishes the wash drawings which emphasize the text .

		Mrs.
Josephine Dodge Daskam	PERSON	writes a helpful and pleasant book of tales , calling it '' Sister 's Vocation , and Other Girls ' Stories '' -LRB-
Scrib	PERSON	- ner -RRB- .

		The interests in its pages are varied , as such titles as A College Girl '' and '' A Taste of

		Miss

Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- , an account of a mild-mannered little girl with a passion for being good .

		Miss
Ida Waugh	PERSON	has made the draw - ings for the book , which resembles its numerous pre - decessors from the same hand .


Kentucky	LOCATION	, that land of lovely women and consequential men , is the special discovery of Mrs.
Annie Fellows-Johnson	PERSON	, who uses it to good advantage in `` The Little Colonel 's House Party '' -LRB- Page -RRB- , illustrated by Mr.
Louis Meynell	PERSON	.

		The `` little colonel '' is both a colonelet and a coloneless , and a bright little American girl in the bargain .

		Bears , soft Southern accents , darkies , and local color make the book both unusual and attractive .

		From the same hand , but with pictures by Miss
Etheldred B. Barry	PERSON	, comes '' The Story of Dago '' -LRB- Page -RRB- , '' Dago '' being a little monkey , fascinating to read about , as these small cousins of ours always are .

		Mrs.
Fellows-Johnson	PERSON	carries him through some most laughable adventures , in one of which he stops an express train by swinging on the bell rope .

		With well-worn plots , the two stories which make up '' Old Lady and Young Laddie '' -LRB-
James H. West Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- have undoubted pertinence at this time , and inculcate the best of morals .

		They are by Mrs.
Kate Whiting Patch	PERSON	, with pictures by Miss
Bertha G. Davidson	PERSON	Those who recall '' The Prince of the Pin Elves , '' by Mr.
Charles Lee Sleight	PERSON	, will be glad to read a continuation of the story from the same hand , with numerous illustrations by Miss

1900	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 507 and the colored pictures by Miss
Kate Greenaway	PERSON	show three girls of assorted sizes , two with light hair and one with dark hair .

		Mother Goose , perennial well-spring of wholesome mirth , is the foundation for the book , which is worth anyone 's while to read .

		Tunes are pro- vided , music and all , and if our children can not all be Miss
Greenaway	PERSON	's kind of children , they can all read what they said and did and sang An ingenious and profitable work is labelled , somewhat extensively , '' The Home of
Santa Glaus	PERSON	, a Story of
Leslie Gordon	PERSON	's Visit to Father Christmas , and of the Strange Sights he Beheld in the Town of Toys '' -LRB-
Cassell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		It is an original book , especially in respect of its illustrations , which are reproduced from Mr.
Arthur Ulyett	PERSON	's photo - graphs .

		Mr.
George A. Best	PERSON	tells the story of the dolls and other toys which make up the subordinate charac - ters of the narrative , and their likenesses are used in a novel manner for the pictures .

		As a welcome sequel to the favorite ''
Arabella	PERSON	and Araminta '' stories ,
Miss Gertrude Smith	PERSON	.

		has provided '' The Roggie and Reggie Stories '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , and the successful pictures of the previous work are made new for this by Mr.
E. Mars	PERSON	and
Miss M. H. Squire	PERSON	, all in color .

		Arabella and Araminta appear in the narrative , but not in the illus - trations , and the ensemble is admirable '' The Jungle School ; or , Dr.
Jibber-jabber Burchall	PERSON	's Academy '' -LRB-
Cassell	PERSON	-RRB- is by Mr.
S. H. Hamer	PERSON	, the drawings by Mr.
Harry B. Neilson	PERSON	, two ingenious and witty gentlemen who will be recalled as the inventors of ''
Micky Magee	PERSON	's Menagerie '' a year or two ago .

		The eminent pedagogue at the head of this institute of learning looks mightily like a dog , and his pupils for all the world like monkeys , tigers , and their cousins and aunts , though the life is that of the conventional English boarding-school , con - siderably jollified .

		Miss
Margaret Johnson	PERSON	both writes and illustrates What Did the Black Cat Do ?

		Guess ! ''

		-LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- , the hand lettering being in her well-known manner , with pictures of things introduced instead of the names of them .

		It may be added that the Black Cat does almost everything , from losing a pair of spec - tacles to putting his feet in the ink Mr.
S. H. Hamer	PERSON	writes the text of '' Animal Land for Little People '' -LRB-
Cassell	PERSON	-RRB- , the numerous pictures being half-tone repro - ductions of beasts in the
London	LOCATION	Zoological Gardens , which give the work an air of undoubted authenticity .

		A miscellany of pictures , rhymes , and prose is to be found in ''
Bo	PERSON	- Peep , a
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	for the Little Ones '' -LRB-
Cassell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Some of the drawings are as funny as they can be , one concerning a boy , a cow , and a camera be - ing especially noteworthy .

		But the greatest of all the collections for small boys and girls will be found again in '' The Little Folks ' Illustrated Annual '' -LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- , for which the cleverest productions of many pens and pen - cils have been selected , with great good taste and entire good nature
E. Nesbit	PERSON	has written a most delight - ful addition to unnatural history , a sumptuous book illustrated by Mr.
H. R. Millar	PERSON	, with a number of decorated pages by Mr.
H. Granville	PERSON	Fell .

		The re - sult is given the name of `` The Book of Dragons '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , and contains eight chapters , each dealing with certain interesting episodes in the life-history of one particular dragon .

		Some of these beasts are wild and some quite domestic in their personal habits , de - pending to a marked degree on the sort of example set them by the numerous small girls of the stories , who are , or ought to be , their betters .

		It is an undiluted pleasure to announce a re - issue of Mr.
Walter Crane	PERSON	's large series of picture books issued by Mr.
John Lane	PERSON	, the color printing and engraving by Mr.
Edmund Evans	PERSON	. ''

		The Frog Prince , '' '' The Hind in the Wood , '' and '' Beauty and the Beast '' are at hand , with all their wealth of color and detail .

		Apart from the his - toric value of the text the pictures are sufficiently dec - orative to be used on the nursery walls by lovers of life and beauty .

		Favorite There remain for mention a few good old author * in books made new by the ingenuity of wri - newform .

		i ^ rs , artists , or publishers , giving a new lease of life to favorites which have long proved themselves superior to the sharpest tooth of time .

		Not the least ingenious of these is a clever adaptation of JEsop by Mr.
James J. Mora	PERSON	, which he calls `` The Animals of ^ Esop '' -LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Mr.
Mora	PERSON	is best known as an artist , and his innumerable sketches , scattered through the text and margins , do nothing to belie his excellent reputation in that regard .

		But in addition to all this , he has modified and modernized the ancient fables in quite the spirit of the original , leaving a book which will amuse at the same time that it impresses the good old lessons of the lapsing ages .

		Judge
Edward Abbott Parry	PERSON	has returned to an earlier man - ner in his rendering of ''
Don Quixote	PERSON	of the Mancha '' -LRB-
John Lane	PERSON	-RRB- , leaving the broader humor of his '' Butter - scotia '' for an adaptation of
John Shelton	PERSON	's famous translation .

		Mr.
Walter Crane	PERSON	makes the drawings for the sumptuous work , which , though it contains hardly a tithe of
Cervantes	PERSON	's history , is excellently done , once the audacity of it has been condoned .

		Of less daring , perhaps because the text is in a more archaic English , is Miss
Mary Macleod	PERSON	's '' Book of King
Arthur	PERSON	and His Noble Knights '' -LRB-
E. & J. B. Young & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , with a careful introduction by Mr.
John W. Hales	PERSON	, and numerous illustrations by the sculptor , Mr.
A. G. Walker	PERSON	.

		The stories are taken bodily from Sir
Thomas Malory	PERSON	, and the introduction rejoices in a biographical account of that gentle knight , made possible by Professor
Kittredge	PERSON	's recent investi - gations and discoveries .

		The book is a joy to those who have the love of the
Round Table	ORGANIZATION	in their hearts , and will answer for large children as well as small . ''

		Fairy Tales from the Arabian Nights '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- contains most of the prime favorites of that glowing work , including accounts of such important function - aries as AH Baba ,
Aladdin	LOCATION	, Prince
Camaralzaman	PERSON	, the King of
Persia	LOCATION	, and the Princess of the Sea .

		Twelve pictures by Mr.
T. H. Robinson	PERSON	, the frontispiece in color , make the little book a delight .

		With Mr.
George Ludington	PERSON	Weed 's '' Life of St.
John	PERSON	for the Young '' -LRB-
Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- , a companion to last year 's life of
St. Paul	ORGANIZATION	, both of them pious and carefully-executed works , the reviewer of children 's books wishes his readers a very merry new century .

		He writes delightfully .

		Courant -LRB-
Hartford	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		An artistic work ... Delightful ... instructive .

		Constitution -LRB-
Atlanta	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		A book to be treasured .

		Serenely philosophical , keenly observ - ant , intellectually suggestive , the placid marshalling of the less obvious facts of nature , with their gentle spiritual interpretation from Dr.
Abbott	PERSON	's pen to make us all human together , is a real triumph of literature .

		The Dial -LRB-
Chicago	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		It is a delight equally bo the outward eye and '' that inward eye which is the bliss of solitude . ''

		Herald -LRB-

		The great thing about his essays and sketches on his rambling excursions is their unfailing charm .

		Herald -LRB-

		He is in close touch with
Nature	ORGANIZATION	.

		He is acquainted with her varying moods .

		Spy -LRB-
Worcester	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		A beautiful book that will delight every lover of Nature in its quiet haunts ... The book is an educator in its best meaning to old and young alike .

		Inter Ocean -LRB-
Chicago	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		Dr.
Abbott	PERSON	has long held an honored place among the few true lovers of nature whom she has blessed with the gift of telling to others the secrets she betrays only to her votaries , the delights she gives freely to those who will search for them diligently , with eyes to see and ears to hear ... These studies gain by a second reading , and a third , as does their reader .

		The illustrator must be in close touch with
Nature	ORGANIZATION	himself ; he certainly is with his author , the charm of whose text he interprets with rare felicity .

		Mail and Express -LRB-
N.Y.	LOCATION	-RRB- Not long ago , in reviewing Mr.
Wishart	PERSON	's important history of '' Monks and Monasteries , '' The Times had occasion to speak of the dignified form which had been Riven to the book by a new publisher ,
Albert Brandt	PERSON	, of
Trenton	LOCATION	.

		Prom the
Brandt	PERSON	press we have now another noteworthy volume , presenting the work of a familiar author , but presenting it with a richness of external form it has not had before .

		This is '' In Nature 's Kealm , '' by Dr.
Charles C. Abbott	PERSON	.

		All readers are familiar with Dr.
Abbott	PERSON	's sympathetic nature studies .

		He is one of those men , like White of
Selborne	LOCATION	, who do not need to go far afield to find matter to interest them ; to whom the woods and meadows , the streams and the skies of their own vicinage are unfailing sources of delight ; who know the signs of the seasons and their myriad manipulations of animal and vegetable life , and who can describe what they see , not merely with scientific accuracy , but with poetic appreciation ... The dainty vignettes and marginal illustrations which decorate the fine broad pages are the work of
Oliver Kemp	PERSON	, who is to be credited also with the fascinating cover design ... Mr.
Brandt	PERSON	has presented his neighbor 's work in a form of which it is altogether worthy , and has made a book that will attract attention by its beauty .

		When
James Anthony Froude	PERSON	undertook to write the History of the Saints he encountered the same obstacles that
Alfred Wesley Wishart	PERSON	met in writing his excellent work , `` Monks and Monasteries . '' '

		There were unlimited materials from which to draw , but without suf - ficient authenticity to justify the record to be made up from them .

		The late professor of history at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	gave up the task as a vain one , but Mr.
Wishart	PERSON	has pursued his to a successful conclusion , and hav - ing winnowed the grain from its disproportionate quantity of chaff , presents us with a volume for which students and general readers must alike feel grateful .

		He has sifted his authorities so carefully that the book has the stamp of truth in every statement placed there , however so deftly , that the literary grace of the work is fully and delightfully preserved .

		Scholarly without being pedantic , earnest and careful without showing either prejudice or partisanship , he sweeps the great field which his title includes , with a strength and evenness that give the book the hall-mark of sterling worth .

		His con - clusions are drawn upon no hypothetical grounds , and if modestly pre - sented do not lack the convincing qualities which Mr.
Wishart	PERSON	so - plainly sees and so effectively puts into view .

		Times -LRB-
